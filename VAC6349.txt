                  In this novel the author has with great ingenuity blended fact with fiction,
                     and few will rise from its perusal without believing that our own revolutionary
                     hero, Michael Rudolph, is really identical with Marshal Ney. The story is full
                     of incident, ranging over a most stirring period of the world's history, and
                     the characters introduced form a striking tableau. Rudolph's domestic trials
                     are finely wrought out, and the character of Alina is powerfully drawn. Lovers
                     of romance, and readers of history will be equally interested in the
                     development of this delightful story.

            PREFACE.
            THERE is a legend which at one time was widely believed in this country, that Michael
               Rudolph, a hero of our own revolution, and Michael Ney, Marshal of France, are the
               same person.
            At the close of the Revolutionary war, Rudolph returned to his home to find a
               faithless wife, and dishonored name. He resigned his position in the American army,
               embarked for Havre, and was known to have engaged in trade in that city for a few
               months.
            He then disappeared, and a young soldier gifted with the same remarkable military
               abilities, enlisted in the French army about the same time. Under Napoleon, the glory
               of this young adventurer finally culminated in that of Marshal of France, Duke of
               Elchingen, Prince of Moskera.
            Imagination has supplied the missing links, and I have not thought it necessary to
               present my hero under any other names than the one he inherited from good people, and
               that he won for himself.

            "THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE."
            
               CHAPTER I.
               A GREAT DESTINY PREDICTED.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Honor to him who self-complete and brave,
                           In scorn, can carve his pathway to the grave,
                           In heeding naught of what men think or say,
                           Make his own heart his world upon the way."
                        
                     
                     —THE NEW TIMON.
                  
               
               IT was yet early spring, in the heart of that valley in which my story opens, yet
                  it was the spring of a genial clime, and favorable season. Gay birds poured forth
                  their sweetest notes of welcome to the young year, the fields of the husbandman
                  already gave promise of a flourishing crop, and all looked peaceful to the eye as
                  the Garden of Eden before sin and sorrow entered there.
               Surrounded by cultivated fields, and sheltered from the summer sun by a grove of
                  majestic elms, stood and humble homestead, constructed of logs rudely cemented
                  together with clay. It was a building of considerable extent, and the presence of
                  industry and taste was testified by the neatness of the little lawn, and the care
                  with which the yellow woodbine was trained over a rustic portico in front. Ivy
                  covered the rough walls of the cottage, and wild vines transplanted from the
                  woodland overarched the narrow casements
                  ments, their foliage of vivid green offering a pleasing contrast to the spotless
                  drapery which curtained them within.
               Sheep grazed in the meadow, and the distant tinkle of the bell worn by the leader
                  of the flock was heard at intervals, and the declining sun brightened every object
                  in the sylvan scene. All was peace without, but the restless, struggling,
                  never-satisfied heart of man was at variance with the very stillness and repose
                  that reigned in this happy valley.
               Within the verge of the forest was a wide pathway completely sheltered from
                  observation from the house, and on this a figure paced to and fro with folded
                  arms, apparently absorbed in reflections of an unpleasing nature. Though scarcely
                  on the verge of manhood, his person was tall and finely proportioned, promising in
                  its full development a combination of strength and physical beauty rarely united,
                  but it was from the face that the power of the mind shone forth. Boy as he was, a
                  strength of purpose lay in the clear, calm, gray eyes, in the curve of the
                  beardless lips, which spoke eloquently of the future character of the man. A high,
                  fair forehead was slightly shaded by masses of dark brown hair, and the expression
                  of the whole face was that of calm, undaunted courage, and indomitable
                  resolution.
               That young heart had already begun to feel the boundaries of his native valley too
                  narrow a field for his adventurous spirit. In imagination he had soared far beyond
                  its leafy shades, and in his sanguine pictures of the future, the laurel wreath,
                  and the victor's triumph were ever the reward of deeds of daring achieved by
                  himself. Discontent was stirring in his breast; to be a tiller of the soil was in
                  his estimation to rise very little superior to the clods among which he labored,
                  and he recoiled with inexpressible disgust from the destiny which fortune had
                  apparently decreed to him.
               The younger son of a farmer in moderate circumstances, the emancipation of the
                  youth from daily toil seemed hopeless. Many years had elapsed since Mr. Rudolph
                  had emigrated from Germany and settled in Maryland; in contented obscurity the
                  family had hitherto dwelt, for they were happy in the new home they had found.
                  Schools were few in those days, and the means of bestowing a liberal education on
                  his children was not within the reach of the good old farmer, but they were
                  carefully trained in the way they should go, and their mother, a woman of strong
                  capacity and considerable information, imparted to them all she knew.
               Mrs. Rudolph possessed a tenacious memory, which was stored with the old ballads
                  of her fatherland, in which were celebrated the exploits of its bravest sons, and
                  these chivalrous pictures of deeds of high enterprise made a lasting impression on
                  the mind of her younger son. Those old legends moved his spirit as a strain of
                  martial music, and the flushing cheek and sparkling eye with which he listened to
                  them, might have revealed to the observer the new world which was opened to his
                  enthusiastic and ardent fancy.
               As the youth pursued his walk, at intervals gesticulating and muttering broken
                  words which revealed the unrest within, the figure of a girl appeared upon the
                  pathway, who stopped and watched his motions with eager interest. She was scarcely
                  fifteen, but was matured both in mind and person far beyond her years. Her form
                  was slight and graceful, and her dress was better than might have been expected to
                  be worn by one who issued from that unpretending homestead, though much of its
                  effect was, perhaps, to be traced to the taste of the wearer, for she was a
                  coquette by nature, and only needed opportunities to develop into—but let the
                  progress of events show what she finally became.
               Alina Derval was not critically beautiful, but there was a charm in her smiling
                  mouth, a fascination in her magnetic eyes
                  which few failed to acknowledge who were thrown beneath their influence. The last
                  were large and expressive, with shell-like lids heavily fringed; their color was
                  hazel, with a gleam of red glinting through them at moments, which gave them the
                  stealthy expression of the feline tribe, but this was evanescent, and the next
                  look would probably be one of tender and pure truthfulness.
               Her complexion was clear, and the rose tint of perfect health glowed through a
                  surface as fine as porcelain. Her lips were full, red as a cleft pomegranate, and
                  unclosed on teeth even and white as the finest pearls. Yet it was this lovely
                  mouth which furnished the true clue to her inner life. It was sensuous, wilful,
                  and indicated a capricious and domineering spirit, which in time to come would
                  have its own way even if her world were crushed in ruins at her feet to attain it.
                  But the crowning glory of Alina was her hair; a mass of golden radiance it now
                  seemed, as the evening sun glinted upon its shining surface. It was braided in
                  long plaits which were coiled around her head, partially concealing its defective
                  outline, for those portions to which the phrenologist assigns benevolence and
                  reverence were depressed, while self-esteem and acquisitiveness rose large and
                  prominent above them. The hair was of that shade immortalized by painters—a
                  deep-toned gold with a gleam of purple shining through its silky masses. The
                  incipient coquette knew and valued its rare beauty, and the greatest care was
                  bestowed on its arrangement.
               Rudolph turned at the end of the walk and saw the girl, who approached him with
                  slow and seemingly timid steps. An expression of radiant pleasure flashed over his
                  face, and he came rapidly toward her. He took both her hands in his own, and
                  looking earnestly in her bewitching face, he said:
               "You seem excited, Alina; what has happened since I left the cottage an hour ago?
                  You are flushed, and your sweet eyes sparkle with unusual brilliancy."
               "I came hither to tell you of the arrival of a stranger, who comes hither
                  to—to—"
               Her voice faltered, and her eyes shrank from the clear light of those bent upon
                  her. Rudolph hurriedly said:
               "Not—not to bear you away from us, Alina?" and there was a choking gasp in his
                  voice which told its own tale of precocious passion, of deep heart-love, such as
                  few men are capable of feeling. The girl faintly replied:
               "I fear it must be so. My uncle has sent hither a young officer who is to escort
                  me to his family. I cannot refuse to go, for I know that I am a charge to your
                  mother of which she will be glad to be rid. I am aware that my presence in the
                  Glen has caused her much uneasiness."
               "Nonsense; my mother is the kindest of women, and she was happy to be of use to
                  one thrown upon her kindness as you were. You must have secured for yourself a
                  warm place in her heart by this time."
               Alina shook her head dubiously:
               "I hoped to make Mrs. Rudolph love me, but there is something which I cannot
                  understand, that holds me aloof from her. I could never confide in your mother,
                  though I know her to be a good and true woman. She holds me always at arms'
                  length, as my nurse used to say, and I have an internal certainty that she does
                  not like me."
               "Not like you, you, so fair, so lovely, so enchanting, for, after
                  all, that is the only word to apply to such a being as you are, Alina. You must
                  overcome this fancy, for my dear mother must approve and love the girl of my
                  heart."
               She glanced archly at him from beneath her long eyelashes, and a half smile
                  wreathed her lips.
               "Perhaps you have named the very cause of her coolness. Your mother loves you so
                  fondly that she cannot bear the thought
                  of a rival in your heart. Besides, Michael, we are both such children that she
                  thinks we should not be dreaming of love and marriage."
               "Children! I am no longer a child. I am a man in stature as I am one in thought
                  and aspiration. The world shall soon hear of me as one, for it is my fixed purpose
                  to emerge from this obscure life, and seek name and fame in the arena of the
                  world. I will become one of the great ones of the earth or die in the
                  attempt."
               His noble face beamed with excitement—his eyes flashed, and his voice sounded as a
                  clarion note ringing over the field of battle. The girl looked at him with that
                  glance of power that bent every one to her will: her cheeks flushed, and her lips
                  were tremulous as she impulsively said:
               "When you speak thus—when you look thus, I forget all that lies between us—I love
                  you and feel that you will overcome every obstacle in your path till you have
                  gained such a position as will entitle you to claim my hand from my proud
                  relatives."
               Rudolph snatched her to his breast as he impetuously said:
               "I swear to do so. I feel the impulse stirring within me that must lead me on to
                  great actions. The future looms before me, and in it I behold myself
                  renowned—wearing the laurel wreath of the victor. Ah! my beloved Alina, when that
                  hour arrives, you, who have not scorned the love of the humble youth fate cast
                  across your path, shall share my glory; you shall walk hand in hand with me upon
                  the path I will open for myself. Ah! it is grand to be the architect of one's own
                  fortunes. I shall win! I feel that I shall!"
               Alina grasped his hand, and earnestly replied:
               "I feel it—I know it. The stamp of greatness is placed upon you. You bear it on
                  your noble brow; in your fearless eyes. I trust to your future, and I will share
                  it with you. You will yet realize the prediction made for you in your infancy.
                  Repeat it to me, Michael, for I never weary of hearing of the grandeur that is in
                  store for you."
               Rudolph smiled:
               "Do you really attach importance to the revelations of the old madman who drew my
                  horoscope, and predicted a wonderful destiny for me? But the things he promised
                  are, you know, impossible to an American."
               "I cannot see why. But was the old man really mad? Tell me the facts of the story,
                  please, for I have only been told of the predictions."
               "His brow flushed:
               "You will think it nonsense, I know, Alina, though your ambition, like my own,
                  will lead you to hope that there may have been 'method in the old astrologer's
                  madness.' The story is this: When I was scarcely a year old, I lay at the point of
                  death, when a wayworn traveler came to our door and asked for food. It was given
                  to him, and after he had satisfied the cravings of hunger, he glanced at the
                  gasping infant that lay in the cradle at my mother's feet. He made a few
                  inquiries, came near, and examined my condition; then, in an assured tone, he
                  said:
               "'Madam, your child will not die. He will live to become a great warrior, and his
                  name shall descend to posterity as the bravest of the brave.'
               "Of course my mother listened eagerly to such words, but she replied:
               "'Only assure me of his life, and the future may take care of itself.'
               "'He will live—I tell you he must live, for the fate of a great
                  empire will more than once hang upon his fearless bravery.'
               "Of course my mother believed the stranger to be insane, and as she was alone in
                  her cottage, she thought it best to humor
                  his fantasy; but she became extremely nervous when he leaned over the cradle and
                  passed his hands over my face and breast. To her astonishment, the convulsive
                  heavings of the chest, which had threatened a spasmodic attack, soon ceased under
                  his mysterious manipulations, and I fell into a quiet sleep. She was grateful for
                  the relief thus afforded, and as the sun was sinking behind the hills, and the
                  next house several miles away, she invited the stranger to spend the night beneath
                  her roof. He readily consented, and when my father came in from his daily toil, he
                  entered into conversation with him, and found that he was one of those restless
                  beings who cannot confine themselves long to one spot. He had wandered in every
                  civilized land, and gathered information in all which was of little practical use
                  to himself. In the East he had studied astrology, and he passed a portion of the
                  night in marking out a rude chart of the wonderful future that was to be mine. My
                  mother preserved it, though both she and my father have often made themselves
                  merry over the improbable events foretold."
               "Why improbable?" was the impatient query of Alina.
               "Because there are no princes in this country, and he said I should become a
                  marshal and a prince, under the greatest conqueror the world has known. That the
                  fame of my leader should eclipse that of Alexander and Hannibal, and I should only
                  be second to him in glory. See how absurd such a prediction is, when made of a
                  poor farmer lad, in a country that is resolute to maintain its freedom even at the
                  point of the sword."
               "Who knows?" said Alina, musingly. "The time has come for great events, for
                  Captain De Vere, the stranger of whom I spoke, says the country is on the eve of a
                  great revolution, and my uncle sent him for me because it will soon be unsafe for
                  me to travel to Virginia. The end of the commotion may be the establishment of a
                  great empire here, which you will help to build up and sustain."
               Rudolph listened with breathless interest.
               "The struggle about to commence! The glorious struggle for independence and
                  self-government! An hour ago all was dark before me, but now I see my way clearly.
                  I will volunteer, and take the first step toward the grand future I am to win. Ha!
                  this is news indeed."
               In his excitement he forgot his companion, and set forward to the house with
                  bounding steps. A pleading voice called after him, "Michael," and he turned and
                  came back even more rapidly than he had left her. She reproachfully asked:
               "Is this the way you desert me at the first intimation of approaching strife? When
                  the trumpet of battle rings out, you will lose all thoughts of love, of
                  home——"
               With passionate solemnity he grasped her hand, and said:
               "When I lose all thoughts of you, Alina, my heart will be cold in
                  death! But I must see this stranger—must learn his tidings from his own lips, for
                  they will change the whole tenor of my life. I go to fight my way to fame, that I
                  may win your hand—be worthy of your love."
               While Rudolph thus spoke, he drew her rapidly forward, and yielding to his
                  impulsive haste, the two soon reached the door of the cottage. Within the large
                  central room, with its bare floor, and rude contrivances for comfort, sat three
                  persons: The elder Rudolph, a man of fifty, though looking much older from the
                  effects of the laborious life he had led; his eldest son, a young man of twenty,
                  in the rough dress of a countryman, but bearing upon his well-knit frame, and
                  finely formed head, the same stamp of nobility which nature had impressed upon the
                  younger son. The strange officer—tall, slender, and aristocratic in his bearing, with his highly ornamented
                  uniform and glittering side-arms formed a striking contrast to the noble old
                  peasant and his handsome son, both of Teuton blood, and bearing the stamp of their
                  race in their blue eyes and fair complexions.
               The stranger was dark, haughty, and stern-looking, with deep set, black eyes, that
                  flashed beneath his overhanging brows with love, anger, or defiance as the spirit
                  within was moved. He was now speaking with much animation, and the father and son
                  were listening with vivid interest.
               "Yes, sir; the unnatural contest between the mother country and the colonies has
                  commenced. Blood has already been shed; but the contest must be a short one, for
                  they can never stand against the power of England. I trust the madness of the hour
                  will soon pass away, and the deluded people return to loyalty to their king."
               Mr. Rudolph shook his head dubiously:
               "It's a long score they have to settle, Captain; and if they've commenced the
                  fray, be sure they will fight it out to the bitter end."
               "But, my dear sir, they will be crushed; the country will be ruined; and all
                  because these madmen will not submit to a trifling tax. 'Pon my honor, it is too
                  absurd to make a quarrel à l'outrance for such a
                  cause as that!"
               "So you may think," replied the sturdy yeoman, "but we
                  think differently. If we submit much longer to the yoke, we shall only be fit to
                  be slaves, and to transmit a heritage of shame to our children."
               The eye of the Englishman flashed on him its haughtiest glare, and he imperiously
                  said:
               "I trust that you and yours are not infected with this wretched heresy. Can you
                  hope to establish a better government than the one under which you have so long
                  flourished? The country, sir, would become the prey of some ambitious military
                  chieftain, even if you could accomplish the feat of wrenching it from the British
                  crown."
               "We can but fight for our rights, and leave the issue to the great Jehovah,"
                  replied the old man, calmly. "If we are to win our freedom, GOD will raise up the
                  right man, and give him wisdom to legislate, as well as to fight."
               "So," replied the officer, scoffingly, "you trust to miracles, as did the
                  Israelites of old; but God is ever on the side of justice, and in this warfare the
                  right will be with the mother country."
               "So you are bound to believe, for you wear her uniform, and are pledged to sustain
                  her cause; but we, who have long suffered wrongs at her hands, hold a different
                  faith. We can but try the issue; and I feel sure that although the struggle may be
                  long, it will end in the freedom of the land."
               Haughty and stern was the expression of the Briton as he listened to these words,
                  and in a constrained tone he said:
               "When I came hither I hoped to find loyal hearts around me. I hear such sentiments
                  with regret from a man like yourself, Mr. Rudolph, for you have judgment and
                  experience, and you must see the ruin that is approaching these prosperous
                  colonies. They must be subjugated, for the mother country has power to crush all
                  opposition; and by heaven! she will do it, sir."
               "And I as firmly believe that we shall win our independence. This wide-spread
                  country, with all its noble advantages, is too great to remain the appanage of a
                  foreign power. Our interests are not those of England, and the time has come to
                  assert our own power of self-government."
               The face of De Vere became scarlet, and a lurid fire flashed from his dark eyes,
                  as he exclaimed:
               "This is treason, sir, and I am an officer bearing the commission of the King of Great Britian. Beware of
                  your words, or it may be worse for you than you imagine."
               Rudolph arose with an expression of dignity which might have become Cincinnatus
                  when accepting the dictatorship of Rome. He said:
               "I stand beneath my own roof-tree, built upon the soil I have redeemed from the
                  wilderness with my own hands, and I claim the right of a free man to utter my
                  sentiments with reference to the struggle which you say has actually commenced. I
                  am too infirm to take an active part in the strife, but I have sons who will
                  strike for God and freedom with right hearty good will, and my blessing shall go
                  with them. What say you, Rupert?"
               The young man thus appealed to eagerly responded:
               "'Right against might' shall be my motto, father, and when the hour comes I am
                  ready for the strife."
               "And I too: I dedicate my life to the noble cause of my country," exclaimed
                  Michael, who, with his companion, had drawn near, unperceived by the eager
                  group.
               De Vere abruptly turned toward the speaker and surveyed him with an expression of
                  stern displeasure. He sarcastically said:
               "The half-fledged falcon is eager to swoop upon its quarry. Take heed, young sir,
                  lest the contest prove too unequal; yet it will be as well perhaps to teach such
                  youngsters as yourself a useful lesson."
               A red flush mounted to the brow of young Rudolph as he listened to this taunt. He
                  impetuously said:
               "And we in our turn will give a lesson to greybeards, by which the world may
                  profit throughout all the ages yet to come. I am but a boy in years, but I bear a
                  man's heart within me, and a patriot's hope for the emancipation of my country
                  from the thraldom in which she has long been held. Every drop of blood in my body
                  thrills to the summons to arms, and I came hither to hear for myself that the
                  glorious strife has actually commenced."
               The officer haughtily regarded his excited face, then glanced at his well-knit and
                  strong frame, and a momentary doubt as to the issue of the impending conflict
                  crossed his mind. If this youth of fiery impulse and dauntless courage was a fair
                  sample of the yeomen of the country, there was little prospect that victory over
                  them could be achieved without a long and arduous struggle; as to the final result
                  he would not permit himself to doubt. "Might against right" had too long been the
                  motto of his arrogant country to permit one wearing the British uniform to
                  anticipate any other than final submission to her power. De Vere coldly
                  replied:
               "The strife has commenced, but by the time you are thoroughly
                  drilled, and prepared to take part in the war, it will be ended. There is no
                  concerted action between the colonies, and the revolt must soon be crushed out.
                  Let me advise you to temper your warlike ardor, or to take the side of justice and
                  loyalty."
               The clear eye of young Rudolph met the stern one of the speaker, but it did not
                  quail before it. With that simplicity which is the test of true greatness, he
                  said:
               "I intend to be both loyal and just, though we probably differ in the application
                  of the words. I must be loyal to the cause of my native land, and just to weigh
                  her causes of complaint against the mother country. I cannot argue with you, for I
                  have little learning, but I can feel for right and justice, and am resolved to
                  cast my destiny with that of those who seek to uphold them."
               "Tush! that is the universal cant," was the contemptuous reply, "as if the
                  government from which you are seeking to escape is not the best, the most
                  munificent in the world. You will impoverish your country—ruin and desolation lation will follow this mad outbreak;
                  and, after all, the authority of the king will reign paramount over the land
                  before a year has passed away."
               "Then the Anglo-Saxon race will have lost its valor. Onward in the march of life,
                  is their watchword, and having once undertaken a cause, they never give back. The
                  end may be long in attaining, but it will come, and freedom will be won."
               "Freedom; is it not yours already? But I forget myself; I did not come hither to
                  argue on the right of my master to his own dominions; it is only my business to
                  defend his cause. It gives me great pain to see the seeds of rebellion sown
                  broadcast over the land. In traveling hither I have heard nearly the same
                  sentiments expressed in every house that sheltered me."
               "And yet you confidently look forward to the restoration of the king's authority,"
                  said Mr. Rudolph, with a grim smile. "It is the people who are moving
                  in their might, and I feel that God will be with them. I would not be discourteous
                  to a guest, and therefore I beg that this discussion may be ended for the
                  present."
               The officer bowed, and turning to Michael, said:
               "This too is your son, I presume, Mr. Rudolph; though he is very unlike his
                  brother."
               The old man smiled.
               "He is his mother's image, and his father's hope. Michael is a fiery lad, but a
                  better heart does not beat in a human bosom. He has always had a great hankering
                  after military honors, and I expect to see him a great warrior yet. His
                  horryscope, as the old fellow called it, was drawn in his infancy, and Michael is
                  to be a very great man—even a prince after he has won ever so many battles."
               "Then he must serve under a king," said De Vere, gravely, "for such titles are not
                  won under republican rulers."
               "But not under British rule," replied Rudolph, significantly, "for
                  with them, princes are only found among the royal family. If I ever attain such
                  distinction, it must be through my own good sword, backed by deeds of noble
                  daring."
               "Doubtless the leaders of the rebellion dream of building up a great empire here,
                  and of creating titles as high-sounding as those that are so rife in foreign
                  courts," said De Vere, scornfully. "But even if gained, they will lack the
                  prestige of long descent, and their owners the refinement inseparable from high
                  caste."
               "We have not many books," said Michael, "but among them are a few histories of
                  crowned heads, and I have not found that either intelligence or refinement are
                  monopolized by them. On the contrary, the great ornaments of nearly every
                  distinguished court have risen from the people by innate force of character. Boy
                  as I am, I have had visions of a great conqueror sprung from the people, who
                  swayed a continent by the force of his own powerful genius. Honors flowed freely
                  from his hand, and a galaxy of talent and fame, more brilliant than the world has
                  yet seen, gathered around him. Perhaps this vision is to be realized in this
                  country. Who knows?—let it be where it may, I shall play my part in the grand
                  drama, which is opening even now. The hour for action has arrived, and I will
                  prove myself no laggard in the path of duty."
               "Tush! you are but a boy, and what is more, a dreamer," replied De Vere,
                  contemptuously, and he turned impatiently away, and gazed through the door. Rupert
                  here asked:
               "Where has fighting taken place? The name of the place shall be always
                  remembered."
               "It was at some insignificant little town in the colony of Massachusetts. Lexington was the name; but it was a
                  mere skirmish—nothing of any consequence. A few battles, and the whole thing will
                  be put down. It is impossible for these colonies to stand against the power of
                  Great Britain."
               "And I say it is impossible to hold men in slavery who are worthy of
                  freedom," said Michael, with fire. "The battle is not always to the strong, but
                  perseverance may accomplish a victory over power, through sheer weariness of the
                  contest. We may struggle for years, but we shall surely conquer in the end."
               "Verily, here is a second Daniel come to judgment," said De Vere, with a
                  bitterness he could not control. "On the contrary, I say that the might of a
                  powerful nation is not to be set at naught by a handful of undisciplined
                  countrymen, without military knowledge, arms, or resources. It is sheer madness to
                  provoke such a contest."
               "The back is fitted to the burden," said Mr. Rudolph, with a grim smile. "But
                  enough of this; my son, do not forget the courtesy that is due to a guest beneath
                  our roof. When the time comes, act, but leave alone discussion that
                  can only irritate and imbitter."
               He placed his hand on the shoulder of Michael, and the youth bowed submissively;
                  but a fiery pang of jealousy darted through his soul as he measured the graceful
                  form of the stranger, and compared his aristocratic bearing with his own rough
                  exterior. The certainty that Alina Derval would be exposed to his fascination,
                  thrown completely upon his protection for many days to come, was gall and wormwood
                  to him. His soul of fire had bowed already before a girl's wiles, and the love she
                  had awakened was in proportion to the depth and intensity of his own nature. He
                  turned away heart sick, and went again into the open air to breathe more
                  freely.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               THE YOUNG LOVERS.
               ALINA had lingered beneath the shadow of the portico, and as Rudolph issued from
                  the house she turned her face toward him, wearing its most charming smile. She
                  joined him as he walked away, and carelessly said:
               "You must not look so glum while I stay, Michael. What have you heard that makes
                  your eyes flash as if you wish to strike at some one."
               Rudolph paused, set his teeth firmly together, and looked searchingly upon her.
                  Alina playfully raised her hands, and with a light laugh, said:
               "You look as if you had seen a spirit, and an evil one at that. What is it,
                  Michael?"
               "I have seen some one who may work me evil; and I almost feel that he will do it
                  in some way. Alina, this man who comes to take you to your uncle is handsome and
                  young. He will certainly make love to you. I know it, for men of his stamp always
                  amuse themselves with whatever falls in their way. But he will not be in earnest,
                  Alina. His professions will be as hollow as his heart is false, and I warn you to
                  beware of him. If you betray me for him, you will lose everything—everything."
               "Mercy, Michael, when did you set up to be an oracle, I wonder, and why should you
                  speak in this fierce and solemn way to me? Have I not told you that I love you?
                  that I will wait to share with you the splendid future you are to win? What more
                  can I do, pray?"
               "You can guard your faith; refuse to let your heart be tampered with, as this dark
                  stranger will surely attempt to do. Oh, Alina! keep your plighted troth pure and
                     true, and I swear to you to accomplish
                  the astrologer's prediction. I will place a coronet upon your brow, and in the
                  light of the fame I will win by my valorous deeds, we will walk hand in hand in
                  such happiness as was known to Adam and Eve in Paradise."
               He took her hands, clasped them fervently to his lips and heart, and looked into
                  her eyes with an expression of such heroic trust that she was moved. She dimly
                  felt that this unformed boy, with his grand nature, his undeveloped talents, did
                  not promise more than he might perform. Unpromising as surrounding circumstances
                  were, the arena of great events was opening, and he must rise to the top of the
                  wave that led to fame and fortune. Alina possessed great ambition, intuition
                  beyond her years, and withal, her heart had been touched by the passionate
                  devotion of the youth. After a pause, she replied, with serious emphasis:
               "My troth is yours, Michael, and it is my purpose to keep it in good faith. We are
                  too young to marry yet, and my uncle will not think of matrimonial prospects for
                  me for at least four years to come. In that time, you can win your way to such a
                  position as will entitle you to his consideration."
               "Thanks, my darling; but your uncle will scarcely be willing to bestow your hand
                  on a revolutionist, I am afraid. My hand will be raised in defence of my country,
                  that of your relative against its freedom."
               A pale shadow crept over her face as she listened, and she slowly said:
               "Then your bright future is all a dream, Michael. The revolt will be put down, and
                  its leaders punished; if you really love me you will join the side that is bound
                  to be successful. It is your only chance to win my uncle's consent to our union;
                  he will never give my hand to him who raises his arm against the royal cause. You
                  cannot surely mean that it is your purpose to fight against the
                  mother country?"
               "Alina, I must espouse the cause of justice. For my soul's salvation, I dare not
                  take sides against men whose battle-cry is freedom from oppression."
               "Oppression! Nonsense! Who interferes with them unlawfully? I have often heard my
                  father say that the colonies are better off under the protection of a great
                  country like England, than they would be if they attempted to stand alone among
                  the nations of the earth. You will not risk ruin by joining a cause that
                     must fail? Say that you will not, for my sake."
               She bent her seductive eyes, glittering through tears, upon him, and the soft
                  clasp of her slender fingers thrilled his hand as she laid her own upon it.
                  Rudolph felt all her fascination, all her power to mould others to her will, but
                  something within him struggled against the wiles that would lay him as a shorn
                  Samson at the feet of this Delilah, and he fervently said:
               "I love you, Alina, with the strength of manhood, united with the passionate
                  impulse of the boy, which in years I still am. Out of this great love shall spring
                  the power to win you even from your haughty and prejudiced uncle; but my path lies
                  with the new men, and the new era that is rising. How can one humbly born, and
                  reared in the lowly sphere of a yeoman's son, hope to rise to distinction among
                  the aristocratic sons of England? No—it is here, and with the new cause that I
                  must identify myself if I would win a name, and fame, among men. I shall gain
                  them, and this dear hand shall be my sure reward—speak, Alina; will not the
                  successful revolutionist be as welcome to you as if his hard-won honors had been
                  the gift of a royal hand?"
               She looked upon the frank, handsome face; into the deep, expressive eyes, so full
                  of fire in moments of excitement ment, so
                  tender now as they sought to read his fate in her own, and her best feelings were
                  aroused. She held out her hand with a half averted face, and said:
               "Make your name famous, Michael; win a station that is worthy of me, and I will
                  not refuse to share it. But in the meantime our troth must be held as a secret
                  between us. My uncle would be sure to disapprove of this childish dream of love,
                  if it came to his knowledge, therefore we must keep our own counsel."
               "That we will do, my darling. Deep in my heart will I bury our precious secret,
                  and banquet on the hope in the future that lures me on to deeds of noble daring.
                  Four years! that is a long time in which to act. When you are nineteen, and in the
                  bloom of your radiant beauty, I will lay my laurels at your feet, and claim my
                  reward."
               "And you shall receive it," was the gracious response, though a moment afterwards
                  she broke into a merry laugh, and exclaimed:
               "Why, what a couple of mad children we are, to say what we will do four years
                  hence. It is an age, in which a thousand things may take place of which we do not
                  dream now. In that time you will see scores of prettier girls than I am, and give
                  your heart in turn to each one that angles for it. 'Man is inconstant ever,' says
                  the poet, and in that respect I believe that women are not far behind them."
               There was a tone of light mockery in her voice that jarred painfully on the
                  feelings of her companion. He dropped the hand he had taken in his own, and
                  bitterly retorted:
               "And you will find amusement in listening to the flatteries of yonder gay gallant,
                  who comes to bear you away as an errant damsel. You but anticipate my inconstancy
                  as an excuse for your own. Is it not so, Alina?"
               She looked upon his bent brow, and again laughed.
               "One would think you a real tragedy hero, to see you now, Michael. I declare, I
                  believe I shall be half afraid of you, after all, and had better accept the homage
                  of a carpet-knight like this Captain De Vere. He would yield to my fantasies, and
                  would seek to win my smiles by such flatteries as women like to hear, while you
                  would expect me always to yield to you—is it not so, Michael?"
               There was a tone of mocking banter in her voice that bitterly pained him, while it
                  had the effect of more deeply enthralling him, for this girl, with her light
                  nature, her gay with, and winning ways, had taken such a hold upon his heart, that
                  Rudolph felt as if life would be worthless without her companionship. He did not
                  reply to her immediately; he fixed his large, luminous eyes upon her with an
                  expression that caused hers to drop before them, and then in a soft, ringing voice
                  he said:
               "Such obedience as is lawful for the wife to render to the husband I would exact
                  of you, and no more, Alina. My tender love shall be your shield; my strong arm
                  your support, and sorrow that I can avert shall never fall on you. To Captain De
                  Vere, you would be the plaything of an hour; adored as long as you fascinated him,
                  and then thrown by as a broken flower that has lost all its sweetness. See—I am a
                  seer in my own way, and I foretell your doom with either of us. Choose your
                  fate."
               A shiver passed over the girl's frame, and she grew pale: as a lightning flash, a
                  gleam from the future came to her soul, and she felt that her lover's prescience
                  was not entirely at fault. With a forced laugh, she said:
               "You frighten me with your solemn looks and strange words. It is cruel, and
                  unmanly, to talk to me in this strain, when I have again and again, assured you of
                  my love. Captain De Vere is nothing, can be nothing to me. I merely travel under
                  his protection as far as Baltimore, where
                  we shall join the major of his regiment, whose wife will take me under her
                  protection till I reach Norfolk, where my uncle is stationed."
               The brow of Rudolph cleared, and he gently said:
               "Pardon me Alina, I have been unreasonable, for I was jealous at the thought that
                  this young officer would have you so long under his exclusive care. This alters
                  the aspect of affairs, and I can part from you with an easier heart."
               "I am glad that you are satisfied. I shall soon be under the protection of Mrs.
                  Stanmore, and I shall be very careful not to accept the attentions of Captain De
                  Vere further than will be absolutely necessary to my comfort on the journey.
                  There—does that satisfy you, you exacting creature?"
               "It must, for I have no power to arrange it otherwise, but oh! Alina, if I could
                  keep you forever from the acquaintance, the influence of this man, I would gladly
                  do it. I mistrust him; I have taken one of those strange aversions to him which I
                  believe nature often sends as a warning. When I looked upon him I felt as if the
                  evil genius of my life had crossed my path. He and I will yet meet in deadly
                  strife; I am sure of it, and when that hour arrives, one or the other will bear
                  the mark of Cain, but which it will be, God above can alone foresee."
               He was pale with emotion, and his voice sounded low and ominous. Again that cold,
                  thrilling pain ran through the light heart of the young girl, who listened to his
                  words. She drew near him, laid her hand caressingly upon his arm, and looking into
                  his eyes, she deprecatingly said:
               "Not from me—oh, not from me, Michael, shall come that cause of strife. I bantered
                  you idly, but my heart is true to you."
               He grasped her hand so firmly as to cause her to cry out with pain, and in accents
                  she never forgot, said:
               "See that you keep your pledge before God and man, or he curse of blood will
                  indeed cling to you."
               At that moment a pleasant voice was heard speaking from a door which opened from
                  the side of the cottage towards which they had strolled.
               "Michael—Alina, come in; supper is served, and we are ready to sit down."
               "Yes, mother," responded Rudolph, and the two, endeavoring to look as usual,
                  approached the house.
               Mrs. Rudolph, a fair, middle-aged woman, with the same air of simple grandeur that
                  characterized her younger son, watched them as they drew near, and drew her own
                  rapid conclusions as to the nature of the interview which had just passed. A clear
                  head and warm heart, with keen perceptive powers, gave her the same species of
                  intuition that belonged by right of inheritance to her son. Though clad in the
                  homely garb of a farmer's wife, she had the calm bearing of conscious power, and
                  an expression of quiet superiority which might have become a duchess. Her features
                  were clear and regular, and from her broad brow the prematurely gray hair was
                  combed back, and knotted at the back of the head, thus defining its antique
                  outline and noble proportions.
               Mrs. Rudolph might have sat for the picture of Volumina going forth to meet her
                  renegade son, though she had little fear that one of her race would ever prove
                  untrue to the land of his birth. Tender and earnest was the look of affection that
                  dwelt upon her beloved boy as he drew near, accompanied by one she feared was to
                  become the blight upon his future, for she comprehended the depth and strength of
                  her son's nature, and she mistrusted the truth of her who had inspired this
                  precocious passion. Neither of them looked at her, for both felt that her piercing
                  eye was upon them, and they dreaded her penetration.
               Alina passed in, and Mrs. Rudolph's hand was laid softly upon the shoulder of her
                  son, as she whispered:
               
               "Do not permit the stranger to fathom the secret of your heart, my boy. See—he
                  comes—cast off that look of care, and take your part in making his stay beneath
                  our roof as pleasant as may be."
               Michael started, looked an instant upon her face, and smiling with some effort,
                  replied in a low tone:
               "Thank you, mother; I was wrapped in my own thoughts, and forgetful of what others
                  might see. I will talk with you to-night, and tell you what is weighing on my
                  mind."
               She nodded, smiled kindly in return, and hastened to take her place at the head of
                  the well-supplied table. In honor of the strange guest, it was set out with
                  antique china, ornamented with bouquets of gaily-painted flowers, which had been
                  an heirloom in Mrs. Rudolph's family for several generations. The old-fashioned
                  teapot and cream-jug were of silver, and were as bright and glittering as if just
                  from the hands of the maker; and the tiny tea-spoons of the same metal bore upon
                  them a knight's crest. De Vere was evidently surprised at these evidences of good
                  taste in so humble a homestead, and he glanced with an expression of respectful
                  deference at the noble-looking woman who welcomed him to the hospitality of her
                  lowly home with the dignity of a high-born dame. He seated himself at her right
                  hand, and in courtly phrase apologized for his intrusion beneath her roof.
               "The stranger and the wayfarer are always welcome," she quietly replied; "and the
                  friend of Miss Derval need make no apology for his brief visit to those who
                  received her from her mother's hands."
               At this allusion to her deceased mother, De Vere glanced toward the young lady who
                  sat opposite to him. She seemed absorbed in thought; and his eye traveled on to
                  Michael, who also looked like one in a vague dream, and a suspicion of the truth
                  dawned on him. In his first interview with Alina he had scarcely remarked how
                  attractive she was, but now his perceptions, quickened by a latent feeling of
                  hostility toward the free-spoken youth who had already wounded his self-love, De
                  Vere read the secret drama that was passing before him.
               This yeoman's son had dared to lift his eyes to the daughter of a noble race, and
                  she, young as she evidently was, had not frowned upon his presumptuous passion.
                  This discovery furnished the key to the ambitious aspirations to which Rudolph had
                  lately given utterance, and De Vere smiled as he thought how easily he could foil
                  him, with the opportunities that lay before him. The repulsion of which Rudolph
                  had spoken was mutual, and De Vere exulted in the thought that through his efforts
                  this first pure and ardent affection should be crushed; be remembered throughout
                  life as a dream of agony and despair; yet he talked on as pleasantly, as gaily, as
                  if no thought of evil had entered his heart.
               Gradually Alina listened and replied, and the brilliant glow of animation that lit
                  up her features and kindled the bright flush of conscious admiration upon her
                  transparent cheek, made De Vere think her charming—almost beautiful. Nor was the
                  attraction of this stranger felt alone by the young girl, for he possessed a
                  wonderful power to charm all who listened to the pleasant flow of his words. He
                  was not a brilliant talker, but he had good sense, much cultivation, and great
                  knowledge of life for a man yet under thirty. He had served in India, been thrown
                  with various classes in life, and had learned something from all with whom he was
                  thrown in contact. In addition to this, he had a vibrant, musical voice, which
                  seemed to be the echo of a soul of far deeper sensibility than De Vere
                  possessed.
               Even Mrs. Rudolph, with her calm sense and accurate judgment, felt the fascination of his manner; and
                  she glanced from him to Alina with that quiet prescience which foreshadows
                  probabilities in the future, and she marvelled if Michael foresaw the drama that
                  might be now opening. His brow was shadowed, and his eyes troubled, and she felt
                  for his present suffering, though seeing for him ultimate freedom from an
                  entanglement she dreaded, she could scarcely have explained why.
               When De Vere finished his tea he balanced the spoon upon his finger, and examined
                  the crest stamped upon it. With a smile he turned to his hostess and said:
               "Even without this evidence of gentle descent, madame, I should have inferred from
                  your appearance and manners that you are of good lineage. Nature does not stamp
                  her mark of nobility on those of plebeian blood."
               A faint flush came upon the cheek of Mrs. Rudolph, and her eyes flashed with
                  momentary pride; but it was quenched at once as they fell upon her husband, for he
                  had no claim to knightly ancestry; and she felt that in his upright integrity,
                  nice sense of honor, and tender strength of soul, few among the most lordly could
                  be compared with him. She replied, with some reserve:
               "Those spoons are an heirloom from my grandfather, who was the youngest son of a
                  German baron. He left his father's roof to marry one so far below him in station
                  that he was never forgiven. He accepted a peasant's lot for the sake of the wife
                  he loved, and his descendants have claimed no higher position than he chose for
                  himself."
               "It is singular," replied De Vere, "how many offshoots from noble European
                  families are found in the most humble sphere in this country. Every civilized
                  nation and every class has its representative, and the people yet to spring from
                  this intermingling of races, should, if physiology be true, be the greatest the
                  world has yet seen. Yet I, an Englishman, believe it will be difficult for them to
                  rise superior to the sons of Great Britain."
               "They do not aspire to rise above them, only to claim an equality with them," said
                  Mr. Rudolph, significantly, as he arose from the table, and led the way toward the
                  outer room. De Vere merely bent his head in reply, and joining Alina, spoke to her
                  with reference to her departure on the following morning.
               He said:
               "The weather promises to be fine, and a gallop of ten miles on horseback will not,
                  I hope, fatigue you too much. We shall find a vessel awaiting our arrival, which
                  trades to that point. The captain's wife is on board, so you will not be without
                  female companionship."
               "I am accustomed to riding even farther than that," she replied. "I shall be ready
                  at the hour named, as I have but few preparations to make."
               De Vere regarded her with a penetrating glance as he said:
               "And I trust you will go without reluctance: the life that opens before you is
                  very different from the dull monotony of this secluded place."
               Alina's eyes wandered toward Michael, who was watching her keenly, and she hastily
                  replied:
               "I have been very happy here. They have all treated me as one of themselves, and I
                  am sorry to leave them for an indefinite time, but—but my uncle has the strongest
                  claim upon me, and when he bids me come to him, I must obey. Excuse me now—I must
                  attend to the few preparations that are necessary for my departure."
               He bowed profoundly, stepped back, and Alina glided rapidly toward her own
                  apartment. This formed a small wing attached to the cottage, and in it every
                  article of luxury possessed by the family had been placed for her accomodation modation. A bed with its snowy covering
                  and netted canopy stood in one corner; a wooden dressing-table, covered with a
                  cloud of white drapery, above which hung an oval mirror, decorated with branches
                  of cedar and bunches of holly-berries, occupied the opposite side. The walls were
                  of rough-hewn logs, daubed with clay, but they had been carefully whitewashed, and
                  over them hung many old and valuable engravings, the produce of German art, in
                  frames of carved wood-work from the same source. A white curtain was drawn back
                  from the only window, and a carpet woven by Mrs. Rudolph herself, covered the
                  floor; a few comfortable chairs of rustic manufacture completed the furniture.
               Several months had passed away since Alina Derval became the occupant of that
                  room; she entered it in desolation and sorrow—she had been tenderly cared for by
                  these good Samaritans, on whom she had no claim save that of humanity, and now she
                  was about to go forth into the untried world, an orphan, and a dependent upon the
                  kindness of her uncle. She sat down and wept a few bitter tears, but she was not
                  one to grieve long over the inevitable. She presently wiped away her tears, and
                  proceeded to pack up the few articles of value she possessed. In this occupation
                  she soon forgot her sadness, and Rudolph, who watched beside her window for an
                  opportunity to speak a few words with her, was heart-struck by hearing, at
                  intervals, suppressed snatches of a song she often warbled. He bitterly
                  muttered:
               "She can sing, while my heart feels as if it is bursting! Oh, God! why do I love
                  this girl so madly? I cannot lose her, yet she is going far from me with that
                  smooth-spoken, deep-eyed villain. I hate him—I hate him."
               The poor youth clasped his hands over his features, and sobbed a refrain to the
                  music. Let no heart scorn his weakness, for he was young and untried in the school
                  of sorrow, and great tenderness of nature is often allied with the most heroic
                  qualities.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               JEALOUSY.
               ALINA DERVAL, though penniless and homeless, was the descendant of two noble
                  families. Her father was the younger son of a French Count, and her mother the
                  daughter of an Irish baronet. The fortune of the Derval family centered in the
                  eldest son, and the younger brother was provided for in the army. He was ordered
                  to Canada while that country was yet an appanage of the French crown; there he
                  distinguished himself, and was promoted to the rank of colonel. A furlough enabled
                  him to visit his native country, and in Paris he met with Captain Fitzhugh and his
                  sister. The latter was a fair young girl just emancipated from the school-room:
                  she spoke French with a charming accent, and was spirituelle and graceful, as most
                  of her high-bred countrywomen are. The heart of the soldier, after a brief
                  struggle, yielded itself captive to her attractions, and they were betrothed. Miss
                  Fitzhugh had no fortune, and her lover had no dependence but his pay; but to a
                  girl who had been reared in the seclusion of a provincial town, that seemed amply
                  sufficient for every rational want, and Alina Fitzhugh accepted the hand of her
                  handsome lover without anticipating objections on the part of her family.
               They did oppose her marriage, for she was too delicate and lovely to be willingly
                  surrendered to the life of wandering and privation she was ready to embrace. But
                  all remonstrance proved vain. Alina was romantic, inexperienced in the struggles
                  of life, and strongly attached to her betrothed. Her parents were both dead, and
                  she was left dependent upon her elder brother, who already had a family of
                  children to rear.
               
               The younger brother, with whom she was traveling at the time she met with Colonel
                  Derval, possessed a small independence, inherited from a deceased uncle, and a
                  captain's commission in the British army. The beauty of his sister induced him to
                  anticipate a brilliant establishment for her, and he had taken her on this unlucky
                  tour in the hope that some wealthy lover might be attracted by her charms. With
                  deep and bitter chagrin he at length yielded to her vehement entreaties not to
                  separate her from the only man she could ever love, and undertook to reconcile
                  their elder brother to the marriage. His consent was reluctantly wrung from Sir
                  Leonard Fitzhugh, for he had looked to the future marriage of so lovely a girl to
                  elevate his family importance, and give him a brother-in-law who could aid him to
                  rise in political life.
               Alina Fitzhugh became the wife of Colonel Derval, and after a brief honeymoon
                  spent in Paris, parted from all she had hitherto known and loved to accompany him
                  to the New World. It was a bitter trial, but she bore it bravely, for deep and
                  strong was her attachment to her husband. In the first year of their union Alina
                  was born at a frontier post of which Derval had the command. He provided for his
                  wife's comfort as far as lay in his power, but the privations she was compelled to
                  bear soon told upon her health and beauty. Other children, weak and fragile from
                  their birth, were nursed through a few wailing months of suffering, and then
                  consigned to a premature grave. Of the four given to them, only Alina lived; but
                  the pale mother bore all with the patience of an angel. She cherished her one
                  flower with deep maternal tenderness, and in her daughter's budding promise found
                  consolation for the many bereavements she sustained. Through them all her
                  husband's unvarying tenderness sustained her, though he too had changed greatly in
                  the progress of time. Disappointed in his hopes of further promotion, imbittered
                  by the struggles inseparable from narrow circumstances, Colonel Derval looked on
                  life with a jaundiced eye, and railed at the neglect with which he was
                  treated.
               The struggle between Great Britain and France for the possession of Canada
                  afforded him opportunities of distinction, but at a most important crisis a young
                  officer was placed over him, whose orders he refused to obey. The most disastrous
                  results flowed from his insurbordination; he was tried by a court-martial, and
                  dismissed from the service.
               Derval had forfeited all claims on the French government, and he was left, with a
                  delicate wife and helpless child, absolutely without means of support. His
                  disgrace affected him keenly—his habits had always been convivial, and, reckless
                  of consequences, he now endeavored to drown the pangs of pride and the
                  consciousness of ruin in the wine cup. Dire was the struggle for the next four
                  years; the tears, the entreaties of his wife were unavailing to arrest his
                  downward career. With failing health, she labored unceasingly with her needle to
                  gain bread for herself and her child. Her friends assisted her at intervals, or
                  she must have failed to secure even this: her brothers sent her small sums, which
                  saved them from actual want, but they were far from knowing the extent of her
                  destitution. Pride and affection for her husband prevented Mrs. Derval from making
                  known to them the wretched habits into which he had fallen.
               When all hope seemed lost, Captain, now Colonel Fitzhugh was sent to the colonies
                  with his regiment. He sought out his sister, and was greatly shocked to find her
                  in a small village in Maryland, whither they had wandered under some delusive hope
                  of employment for Derval, maintaining herself and child by the scanty gains of her
                  needle. Unable to do more for her, Fitzhugh rented a small cottage in the country, to which was attached a few acres of
                  ground, and allowed her from his pay a monthly stipend, which would place her
                  above want.
               At intervals he visited her, until his regiment was ordered to the southern part
                  of Virginia, and then their intercourse was only maintained by letters. Alina had
                  nearly completed her fourteenth year, when her unhappy father was killed by a fall
                  from his horse; the shock laid her mother on a bed of sickness from which she
                  never again arose, though she lingered for many months before death released her
                  from suffering.
               It was at this period that Mrs. Rudolph sought out the lonely stranger, and
                  afforded her that assistance of which she stood so much in need. Hers was the
                  voice that breathed consolation and hope to the stricken woman; hers the hand that
                  was stretched forth to aid the dying stranger, and relieve her broken heart from
                  its last care by taking under her protection the desolate orphan.
               When the death angel at length claimed his own, the young girl was removed to the
                  Glen, and found there such tender consideration for her bitter bereavement, that
                  she was touched and penetrated by as deep a sense of gratitude as it was in her
                  nature to feel. Alina at first grieved passionately over the loss of her mother,
                  but the violence of her emotion soon exhausted itself, and, like the passing of a
                  tropical storm, which leaves renewed beauty in its path, her sufferings only
                  imparted deeper interest to her charms.
               The child had merged into the woman, and a deeper power to fascinate, a vivid
                  consciousness that her dower of youth, beauty, finesse and intellect were to win
                  her way in the path that lay before her, dawned upon her. For the first time in
                  her life she was now thrown with young persons of the opposite sex, and she soon
                  became conscious that the brothers admired her. The natural coquetry of her
                  disposition at first tempted her to encourage both, and find amusement in the
                  jealousy she might thus arouse; but respect for Mrs. Rudolph withheld her from
                  this course, and something in the character of the younger brother also warned her
                  that she would be playing a dangerous game to attempt to trifle with his
                  affections.
               In spite of her efforts to remain indifferent, Michael, with his grand simplicity
                  of nature, and deep enthusiasm of feeling, won upon her regard until she believed
                  she loved him. She listened complacently to his passionate avowals, encouraged his
                  aspirations after a position worthy of her acceptance, and, as we have seen,
                  pledged herself, when won, to share it with him.
               Rupert, whose character was of a different mould from his brother's, soon withdrew
                  from the competition for her favor. He comprehended Alina better than the
                  impulsive Michael, and felt assured that as a wife she would suit neither of them.
                  Her training had not been like theirs; her friends would naturally look higher for
                  her, and he congratulated himself on his own escape from the net which had
                  entangled his brother.
               Mrs. Rudolph, with her deep insight into character, read every phase of Alina's
                  nature, and with deep pain she saw her beloved boy yield himself utterly to her
                  fascinations. She felt a tender and compassionate regard for the friendless girl
                  thus thrown on her protection, but the thought that her noble and highly gifted
                  son should devote to her all the wealth of his impassioned nature, possibly to be
                  met with scorn, and trampled on in the future, caused her bitter pain.
               From Michael's infancy, his mother had watched the development of his fiery,
                  high-toned spirit with intense solicitude. She recognized the lofty nobility of
                  his nature, and confidently believed the prediction so singularly uttered would in
                  time be realized. The narrow boundaries of his humble home could not long confine a young eagle
                  whose wings were ready to soar to the empyrean. All the mother's ambitious hopes
                  centred in him, and she saw, with regret, how entirely he was enthralled by this
                  young girl, whose depth of nature, whose sincerity, she mistrusted. Mrs. Rudolph
                  did justice to the grace and sweetness of Alina, but beneath this fair surface,
                  she felt, lay passions yet undeveloped; impulses that might lead her far astray;
                  and she mourned for the infatuation of her son. Remonstrance was useless—Rudolph
                  was madly in love, and he believed his affection returned; therefore his mother
                  judiciously held her peace, and left future events to work out their own
                  fulfilment.
               Immediately after the death of Mrs. Derval, a letter had been dispatched to
                  Colonel Fitzhugh, informing him of the event; but he was absent from his post at
                  the time of its arrival, and four months elapsed before he took measures to place
                  his niece under his own protection. Mrs. Rudolph welcomed the appearance of De
                  Vere as the signal of the release of her son, and fond as she had become of Alina,
                  she was glad to restore her to the care of her own family.
               When his burst of jealousy and rage exhausted itself, Rudolph wiped away his tears
                  with a feeling of self-contempt, and walked about the yard till he obtained
                  complete mastery over himself. Then he sought his mother, as he had promised.
               Night had now fallen, and Mrs. Rudolph, the cares of the day over, was seated in
                  her own chamber awaiting his appearance. Her husband and elder son were with the
                  stranger in the outer apartment, and their voices were still heard in animated
                  discussion over the disturbed condition of the country. Rudolph threw himself upon
                  a chair, and shaded his face with his hand, that his mother might not read too
                  much of the struggle that was passing within him. She quietly removed the candle
                  to such a position as left his head in shadow, and then said:
               "The first trial of your life has come, my son, but you have strength to bear it
                  as a man should. You love this young stranger, and she believes she
                  loves you."
               "Believes, dear mother! Oh, if it is a belief, and not a deep and
                  earnest reality, I am lost! lost! lost!"
               There was a depth of dreary vehemence in his tones that deeply affected her, and
                  she laid her hand tenderly upon his arm:
               "No, my son—not lost, but strengthened and elevated by the trials that are never
                  sent without a purpose. If it is the will of a higher power that you shall meet
                  with disappointment in the first and sweetest dream of youth, it will be only to
                  prepare you for the battle of life. The promise of a noble nature is not to be
                  blighted by the inconstancy of a light and fickle one."
               Rudolph regarded her with dilating eyes, and his broad chest heaved with
                  irrepressible emotion as he spoke, almost harshly:
               "Mother, why do you so hardly judge Alina? She has pledged herself to wait for me
                  till I can win the right to claim her. Is not that sufficient proof that she loves
                  me?"
               Mrs. Rudolph compassionately regarded him, as she replied:
               "Alina is not the mistress of her own destiny. She is too young to know her own
                  mind in a matter of such vital importance, and her uncle will expect her to choose
                  a husband whose position in life is far higher than yours. You have your way to
                  win amid discouragements and difficulties, and while you are struggling toward
                  independence, this young girl will gain worldly wisdom to show her that her path
                  does not lie parallel with yours. My son, I know that this is a bitter truth, but it is my duty to
                  speak it to you."
               "Mother, you torture me," groaned the poor youth. "I came to you for consolation
                  and hope and you pour coals of fire upon my heart. I have weighed all these
                  obstacles, and I have felt that I can overcome them if Alina will only prove true.
                  Do not tell me she will retract, for there lies despair——"
               Michael threw his arms across the table, and bent his face upon them to conceal
                  the emotion that convulsed his features. His mother arose and stood beside him;
                  after a pause, she softly said:
               "My son, I may wrong Alina. I trust I do, for your dear sake. Hope on, love on; it
                  will give you a purpose in life, and nerve you for the contest every true man must
                  wage whose fortune is to be won by his own right hand. Since you love this young
                  girl thus, I am unwilling to believe that she will prove unworthy of such a heart
                  as yours. Your nature will elevate hers, and in time, she may become your true
                  mate. There, lad, rouse up, and meet the present manfully; from sorrow the flower
                  of joy shall spring up in the future, as surely as the grass puts up after the
                  shower."
               Rudolph listened to her soothing words; the very tones of her mild and even voice
                  had power over him, and he struggled against the tempest of emotion that surged so
                  wildly within his bosom. He presently raised his head, and placing his feverish
                  hand in that which sought to clasp it, feebly said:
               "Mother, you think me very weak, you regard me as a boy without strength of will
                  to carry out my purposes in defiance to opposition; but it is not so. The fiery
                  deluge of passion that surges through my soul has swept away all childish feeling.
                  I love as a man, I will struggle as a man, and conquer fate itself!"
               "If Alina loves you truly all will be well," confidently replied his mother, who
                  began to feel the necessity of soothing his excitement.
               "Mother, she is, she must be true, or your son is lost to you forever.
                  Disappointed in her love, I will seek death, or expatriation. Every association of
                  the past I would seek to blot out which could recal the fatal dream that so
                  maddens my heart."
               "Fatal, indeed, if you can thus speak of relinquishing the ties of home and family
                  affection, through disappointment in one who has been known to you but a few brief
                  months. I did not expect this return for all the tender love I have lavished on
                  you, Michael."
               The wild anguish of the youth was checked, and his tender feelings touched by the
                  mournful accents of his mother's voice. He grasped her hand, as he impulsively
                  said:
               "My mother, my best, and truest friend, pardon my selfishness. While
                     you live, I shall not be desolate, even if this true love be
                  thwarted. Yes—from your noble heart, and gentle counsels, I shall gain courage to
                  bear all that God may send."
               "Amen, my son. Be strong in the faith I have endeavored to give you, and you will
                  conquer in the strife. You have my blessings, and my prayers, and the All Father
                  will not close his ears to the petitions of a loving mother for the child on whom
                  He has bestowed great gifts for a purpose known to Himself alone. Go upon your
                  appointed path; the first blow has been struck for freedom; the flames will soon
                  spread until it envelopes the whole land, and God the merciful, will give the
                  victory to the right."
               She stood with one hand partly raised, the light streaming full upon her fine
                  face, which was pale with emotion, though full of the inspiration of heroism.
                  Rudolph looked on her with reverential awe; his brow cleared, a martial fire gleamed in his eyes, and he raised
                  himself to his full height, as he said:
               "You bid me strike in the cause of freedom. Thanks, my noble mother; from your
                  lips I have learned the legends of your father land, and they have inspired me
                  with the ambition to emulate the deeds of its heroes. I pledge myself to sustain
                  the cause of my country till victory is won, and peace again smiles upon the soil
                  freed from the invader's tread."
               He held out his hand, which his mother clasped in one of her own, and laid the
                  other upon his head, while she solemnly said:
               "I dedicate you, child of my heart, to the glorious cause of freedom. Go to the
                  battle's front, and strike for all that is dear to man. You may seal your devotion
                  to your country with your blood, yet I seek not to withhold you, for in this hour
                  every man should buckle on his sword, and make her cause his own. The blessing of
                  the youngest born shall abide with you, as with Jacob of old."
               Rudolph sank upon his knees and reverently kissed the hand that clasped his own.
                  He then arose, calmed and elevated. The passion that had lately shook his soul
                  seemed dwarfed and common-place, beside the duties that devolved upon him as one
                  of a great people commissioned by Heaven itself to show the nations of the earth
                  their mighty power to conquer and to rule. He looked into his mother's eyes; soul
                  met soul in that mute exchange of feeling, and the son was clasped to her breast,
                  while a wordless prayer for protection arose from her heart, and a vow of
                  self-devotion to the cause he was about to espouse, from his. It was a sublime
                  consecration to duty, worthy to be classed with Spartan heroism.
               Rudolph turned away, and left the room. His mother remained alone to recover
                  calmness and self-control for the interview she intended to seek with Alina.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE BROTHER'S WARNING.
               AT the end of half an hour Mrs. Rudolph tapped upon the door of Alina's room, and
                  the heart of the mother was somewhat reassured when she saw the traces of recent
                  tears upon the young girl's face. She endeavored to conceal them, and hastened to
                  place a seat for her visitor, while she sedulously turned from the candle that its
                  light might not reveal the emotion she really felt. After a pause, Mrs. Rudolph
                  said:
               "My child, we are sorry to part from you. In the absence of any daughter of my
                  own, your presence has brightened our home; but the time will come, Alina, in
                  which I can welcome you as the daughter of my heart. Is it not so?"
               Alina answered in a faint voice:
               "A pledge has passed between Michael and myself to that effect; but if he persists
                  in his intention to espouse a cause that is almost desperate, I have many doubts
                  and misgivings as to the future."
               "Why shall the battle for right and justice be deemed desperate before it is
                  scarcely commenced?" asked the elder lady, with slight asperity. "Alina, if your
                  love for my son is based on his probable success in life, it is not that affection
                  which will bear the test of time and misfortune. You are too young to be bound by
                  any promise you may now make, and too dependent on others to render it right for
                  us to hold you responsible for what may happen in the future; but the lad loves
                  you as few men can love, and your desertion will inflict upon him a blow that must
                  affect him throughout his life. I, his mother, ask you to weigh well the ambitious hopes that may soon dawn upon you; to
                  give full play to the real feelings of your heart, and never to bestow your hand
                  upon another, unless that heart is utterly estranged from him to whom you have
                  given your first promise. Will you pledge yourself to this?"
               "I do—I will. I feel sure that Michael will gain such a position as will entitle
                  him to claim my plighted troth. Ah! if he would only join the British army, I
                  should feel the certainty that in a few years he would be where I wish to see
                  him—at the head of a company of his own."
               "No son of mine shall enroll himself under the standard of the oppressor, though
                  the tenderest hopes of his heart be wrecked by espousing the cause of his
                  country," replied Mrs. Rudolph, proudly. "You must make up your mind to become the
                  wife of an American, or relinquish the love of as noble and tender a heart as
                  beats in a human bosom. If you love Michael as he deserves, you will not hesitate
                  when the hour for a final decision arrives. You are yet almost a child in years,
                  but you have more character than most girls of your age. You have awakened a
                  passion in a high-toned being, which must influence all his future years,
                  therefore I ask of you to pause when temptation assails you; recall the days you
                  have passed beneath this roof, and ask your own heart if it recoils from the
                  sacrifice you must make in becoming the bride of my son. He has everything to
                  win—fame, fortune, and position; can you wait cheerfully, hoping on, trusting on,
                  till a brighter day dawns upon the cause to which he must devote himself? If you
                  can do this, happiness will be yours. If you falter, if you lose faith in him, if
                  your love grows cold in absence, Michael will deeply suffer; but he will survive
                  it. Such souls of fire are not quenched by the inconstancy of any woman, however
                  adored she may be. If such a change should come over you, tell him the truth at
                  once. It will be a bitter blow, but he will have strength to sustain it, or he
                  would be no son of mine."
               "Oh, madam, why should you thus cruelly probe my heart?" exclaimed Alina,
                  passionately. "Is it not enough that I am going away from Michael, feeling that I
                  love him sincerely, without being tortured by such suspicions? I shall redeem my
                  pledge by becoming your son's wife; what more can I say to set your fears at
                  rest?"
               "May God keep you in this mind; in His hands I leave the issue," said Mrs.
                  Rudolph, in tremulous accents. "It may be wrong to seek to bind you by any
                  promise, but so much is at stake for one who is dear to me as the pulse of my own
                  heart, that I risk the condemnation of my conscience in seeking this assurance
                  from you. Under other circumstances, I should be wronging you; but we are on the
                  eve of great events, and by the time you are of an age to marry, my boy will have
                  won his reward, or be numbered with the heroes who die for the right."
               Alina was touched; she earnestly said:
               "And my hero he shall remain, either living or dead. Set your heart at rest, dear
                  Mrs. Rudolph, and teach Michael to have that faith in me which I shall have in
                  him. You will yet welcome me to the old homestead as your daughter; and in the
                  years of my absence, I shall fondly remember the kindness which I have received
                  beneath your roof. Accept my warmest thanks, and be assured that while life lasts,
                  I shall gratefully remember all that you have done, both for my mother and
                  myself."
               The graceful charm with which these words were spoken it is impossible to express;
                  this inexplicable attraction was Alina's birthright; the cestus of Venus which
                  gave her her chief power to fascinate. Mrs. Rudolph tenderly kissed her, and after
                  a pause, the young girl said:
               "I have been looking over some keepsakes that once belonged to my mother, and the sad memories they
                  evoked caused me to shed some tears. For years we led a wandering and wretched
                  life, and they recalled so much of her suffering that I was forced to weep as I
                  looked upon them for the last time."
               "But why the last time, my child? You will surely take with you such trifles as
                  will bring the memory of your mother vividly before you."
               "No," replied Alina, with a pained expression, "I cannot. I do not willingly
                  recall that which makes me unhappy. Life is too short to be filled with bitter
                  memories, even if they are connected with the beloved dead. The fate of my father,
                  the sufferings of my mother, I would bury in oblivion, if the power to forget were
                  mine. Everything that can recall the recollection of those years of humiliation, I
                  desire to put far from me; therefore I wish to leave these souvenirs behind me. I
                  will give them into your care, dear madam, and feel that they will be far safer
                  than with me, in the uncertain and wandering life I shall probably lead with my
                  uncle's family."
               "If you do this to ensure their safe-keeping, Alina, I will gladly undertake the
                  charge; but if you part from them through the feeling of weakness to which you
                  have referred, I must express my deep regret that you should indulge it. Alas! my
                  child, to shrink from pain is not the way to conquer the evil that must mingle
                  with every human lot."
               Tears gathered in Alina's eyes, through which a latent gleam of fire flashed as
                  she replied:
               "It is my nature to shrink from suffering, and when I can put from me that which
                  is past and gone I must do so. God has given me a great capacity for enjoyment,
                  why then shall I mar his intent by doing that which will bring a cloud over my own
                  happiness? No—no—I will leave behind me all that can bring back the wretched past
                  to my memory."
               This characteristic revelation was intensely painful to the listener, for it
                  showed her more vividly than before the wide contrast between these two natures
                  which had been so unfortunately attracted toward each other. But Mrs. Rudolph felt
                  that remonstrance would be useless, for Alina had spoken the truth of herself.
                  Sorrowfully she comprehended that there was no depth, no strength in the soul
                  which had so deeply enthralled her precious boy. What the future would bring forth
                  from this inauspicious entanglement she could not foresee; she could only pray
                  that neither blight nor evil to her young hero should spring from it, for such in
                  her imagination her son already was. She coldly answered:
               "I will not refuse the charge you wish to confide to me. Alina; should you desire
                  to have these things restored to you, you need only notify me and they shall be
                  safely forwarded to you."
               "Thank you, madam; I expected as much of your kindness. I have sealed up a package
                  of letters which passed between my mother and her family. Her journal also, and
                  the few books she left, I wish to place in your charge. Her miniature, and that of
                  my uncle, Count Armand Derval, I shall take with me."
               Alina arose and took from her trunk the articles to which she referred. There were
                  six books which bore marks of constant use—a Bible and prayer-book, with notes on
                  nearly every page, many of which had evidently been blistered with
                  tears—Shakespeare, Jeremy Taylor, and two other works of a devotional character.
                  Mrs. Rudolph opened the Bible, and her voice faltered as she said:
               "You surely will not part with this. These notes are almost a record of your
                  mother's inner life. Oh! my child, this book, if daily studied by you, will keep
                  you in the straight path which leads to peace on earth, and happiness in the life that is to come. These notes will be as
                  the voice of your mother speaking to you from beyond the grave; they will give you
                  comfort and courage in the darkest hours of your life. Take this Bible and
                  prayer-book with you, I entreat."
               Alina listened to this appeal with heaving bosom and quivering lips. After a
                  struggle, she said:
               "I cannot—every page is associated with such humiliation to me, that the mere
                  sight of them is as a stab to my heart. I have a Bible and prayer-book of my own,
                  and they will suffice. If dark hours come to me, as you predict, I must bear them
                  with my own strength. The sight of these things could only make my suffering
                  deeper. Do not think me hard and heartless, for I am only sensitive, and resolute
                  to place far from me that which recalls anguish that has already been endured. The
                  sad fate of my parents has been long enough an incubus upon me; I go to brighter
                  scenes—fairer hopes dawn upon me, and I wish to forget, as far as may be, the
                  gloom that has shadowed my young life. Judge me not harshly, for I feel that I do
                  not deserve it."
               She looked pleadingly in the face of Mrs. Rudolph, who could not resist the
                  appeal, though she felt that the being who thus shrank from the past would
                  scarcely develop into such a woman as she was willing to see her son's wife. She
                  merely said:
               "I will take the best care of these things, Alina, and I will endeavor to obey the
                  injunction which enjoins us to 'judge not lest we be judged.' My affection for you
                  leads me to be as lenient as possible to your failings."
               Alina thanked her with animation, and presently, with a smile as brilliant as if
                  no sorrow had lately touched her, she took up her uncle's miniature, and said:
               "This is Count Derval in his court dress. He holds an office about the person of
                  the king, and lives in the palace. Ah! if he had proposed to take me
                  under his protection, I might have hoped to be the means of bringing to pass the
                  predictions of the astrologer with regard to Michael."
               Mrs. Rudolph took the picture and looked on the handsome man it represented in the
                  brilliant costume of a nobleman of the ancient règime. The face was haughty and the expression cold, though she
                  could trace a strong resemblance to his niece in the brow and the finely formed
                  mouth. She quietly said:
               "My son will be the architect of his own fortune, Alina, though I thank you for
                  the wish to serve him. If you were transferred to the French court, a marriage of
                  convenience would soon be arranged for you, and the hopes of Michael crushed in
                  the bud. In all your father's difficulties I believe his brother afforded him no
                  assistance."
               "No—the more shame to him," was the indignant response. "He replied to none of the
                  letters sent to him, and if it had not been for my Uncle Fitzhugh we must have
                  perished of want. I will at least try and shew him that I am not ungrateful."
               "Colonel Fitzhugh must be a man of kind feeling and noble impulses; you will be
                  safer with him than if thrown amid the corruptions of a foreign court, with no
                  mother to watch over you."
               A faint cloud crossed the brow of the listener, and she decisively said:
               "Yet I would have risked it. I can take care of myself, and turn events to my own
                  purposes. Haughty as the original of this picture must be, I am sure that I could
                  mould him to my will; but my Uncle Fitzhugh is a bold soldier, who makes man,
                  woman and child alike yield to his sway. I shall be forced to do what he thinks is
                  right, without reference to my own wishes."
               "So much the better for you, Alina, for I know that he is an honorable and high-toned man. Follow his
                  guidance and you will be safe."
               A subtle smile flitted over the girl's lips, and she said:
               "I have already done that which, if known to him, would arouse his deepest
                  displeasure. My uncle will scarcely approve of my promise to marry one who will
                  array himself in arms against the cause to which he is devoted. A suspicion that I
                  have done so would be the death-blow to Michael's hopes."
               Mrs. Rudolph listened with pain. After a pause she said:
               "Deception of any kind is wrong; yet this seems a case in which it is impossible
                  to avoid it. I repeat that you are not bound to my son by any promise you have
                  made; your own sense of right must guide you in your future course, both toward
                  Michael and your uncle. It is unfortunate that you should have loved each other,
                  but having done so, all we can now do is to leave the issue in the hands of Him
                  'who doeth all things well."
               She arose, feeling sore at heart, and gathered the books and manuscripts together;
                  how Alina could part from the last, the record of her mother's hopes and fears—of
                  her tender prayers for her future welfare, she could not understand; for
                  penetrating as Mrs. Rudolph was, the character of this unformed girl was an enigma
                  to her. It was one she feared to solve, for she had deep misgivings for the
                  future: she prepared to leave the room as she said:
               "When you call for these things they shall be delivered safely to you."
               A few moments after Mrs. Rudolph's departure, a light tap was struck upon the
                  window, and obedient to the signal, Alina wrapped a shawl over her head and
                  shoulders, and joined Michael, who awaited her at the door. She walked with him
                  beneath the shadow of the trees till a late hour of the night: what passed in that
                  interview was but a repetition of what had gone before—passion, jealousy, and
                  renewed hope to the young lover's heart. Alina used all her power in this last
                  interview to rivet the chain she had thrown over him; she played on every emotion
                  of that excitable nature, and ended her caprices by placing her hand in his, and
                  taking a solemn vow to wed none but him—to defy importunity, baffle opposition,
                  and, if necessary, even to evade the authority of her uncle when the hour arrived
                  in which her lover could demand of her the fulfilment of her troth.
               Hand in hand they at length drew near the house, for the hour of midnight had
                  sounded from the old-fashioned clock that stood in the dining room, and its
                  resonant peal penetrated even to the leafy covert beneath which they wandered.
                  Alina hastily whispered:
               "I hope you are satisfied now with my promise, Michael. In Scotland a witness
                  would only have been wanting to make our betrothal a legal marriage."
               "True, but we are not in Scotland, and there was no witness to our
                  pledges, but the recording angel has not forgotten them; they are registered, and
                  they shall yet be sealed by the voice of a minister of God—yet with this
                  certainty, there is a strange unrest in my soul; a vague dread that I have never
                  before felt—of what can it be ominous, Alina?"
               Alina laughed mockingly:
               "It is only that you hate the thought of seeing me depart under the protection of
                  this young officer. You can also go with me to the Point, and see me safe under
                  the wing of the captain's wife; I am sorry that you cannot implicitly trust your
                  betrothed wife, Michael."
               "You mistake me," he seriously replied. "It is not jealousy that oppresses me;
                  after the sacred pledge you have just given me, I should be base to doubt you. I
                     feel as if a spirit of evil is
                  breathing around me, ready to lay his clutch upon my fate—Alina, beware of this
                  stranger, or what I foretold to you will surely come to pass—his life-blood or
                  mine will be offered as a sacrifice, if you lend a favorable ear to his
                  flatteries."
               "There—I told you it was jealousy. Good night—I must sleep before setting out on
                  my journey."
               "Sleep—I shall not sleep to-night, though I am glad that you can rest before the
                  fatigue of to-morrow."
               There was bitterness in his tone, but his companion did not choose to remark
                  it—she held out her hand, bent her head toward him, and in soft accents said:
               "Take your farewell, now, for to-morrow we must be guarded before others."
               Michael drew her to his beating heart, pressed her tenderly and reverently in his
                  strong arms, and kissed her cheeks, lips, and brow with passionate fervor. With a
                  sudden movement, Alina released herself and disappeared within the house.
               Rudolph did not attempt to sleep that night. He passed its remaining hours in
                  pacing to and fro upon the same path so lately trod with Alina, recalling the
                  pledges she had made, and vainly trying to assure himself that she would prove
                  true through every trial. Toward morning he returned to the house, and threw
                  himself for an hour beside his brother, who was sleeping soundly; but no slumber
                  came to seal the eyes of the restless and excited youth.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE DEFIANCE.
               THE following morning arose in cloudless lustre; the tender leaves of the budding
                  forest, with their varied shades of green, seemed hourly bursting into new beauty
                  beneath the warm sunbeams. A soft air, with promise of coming summer in its genial
                  warmth, fluttered among the early flowers, and the birds sang their glad pæans
                  over the season of plenty and enjoyment that lay before them.
               At an early hour the household at the Glen were astir, and before the sun had
                  fairly shown his red disc above the horizon, a substantial breakfast was served,
                  and the horses of the travelers were at the door. Alina, looking fresh and bright
                  in spite of her nocturnal rambles, made her appearance at the sound of the
                  breakfast bell, and took her usual place near the mistress of the family. Such
                  conversation as passed was addressed to her, for she was the central object of
                  interest to them all.
               Toward the close of the meal, Mr. Rudolph jocularly said:
               "You are running into temptation, my pretty lass, for a young girl like you will
                  find scores of lovers among the young officers that will soon surround you. Look
                  sharp that some one does not run off with your heart before you are old enough to
                  make a wise choice."
               "Thank you for the caution," she replied, with a smile, "But my heart is pretty
                  well guarded," and she glanced furtively toward Michael, who had listened with
                  compressed lips and restless movements to this untoward remark of his father. The
                  glance was caught by De Vere, and he drew his own inferences from it.
               
               "Guarded! by what!" asked the old man. "Not by experience, I am sure, for you are
                  too young to have any; but I dare say your uncle will take all proper care of you.
                  May you be happy in your new home, my child; but if things should go wrong with
                  you, remember that you always have a home beneath my roof. It is an humble but an
                  honest one, and will be open to you under any and all circumstances."
               Alina cast a grateful glance at the speaker, and her voice was tremulous as she
                  uttered her thanks; but De Vere spoke with some hauteur:
               "Colonel Fitzhugh will provide for his niece's future happiness and well being. It
                  will never be necessary for her to seek another protector till she chooses one for
                  life. Your kindness to her in her bereavement is properly appreciated, and he
                  commissioned me to offer such an equivalent as may be acceptable."
               He arose from the table, and drew forth a well-filled pocket book. A glance of
                  fire shot from Michael's eyes, and with difficulty he restrained himself. His
                  father saw his excitement, and with a deprecating motion of his hand kept him
                  silent. The old man also arose, and with simple dignity said:
               "The good Samaritan found his reward in well-doing; the little that I can do in
                  fulfilment of my Master's commands is not to be paid for in British gold. Alina
                  Derval has been as welcome beneath my roof as if she were my own child. Put up
                  your money, young man, for I shall not soil my hands by touching it."
               "But this is an obligation Colonel Fitzhugh will not be willing to remain under.
                  He is able to pay for all you have done for Miss Derval, and anxious to do
                  so."
               Alina started forward, laid her hand upon his arm, and spoke in low, earnest
                  tones:
               "Do not press this subject, if you please. Money can never repay the kindness
                  which has been extended to me here. It is an insult to these noble people to offer
                  it. I will explain to my uncle—he will understand their scruples."
               De Vere bowed with a sarcastic curl of his lip, and replaced the gold he had taken
                  out. With graceful sweetness Alina approached Mr. Rudolph, placed her hand in his,
                  and said:
               "You and your wife have been friends to me when I most needed them. I shall never
                  forget your kindness, nor the offer you have this day made me. Farewell, dear sir;
                  remember your little friend with tenderness, for she will ever retain a fond
                  remembrance of the gentle hearts that soothed the grief of the homeless and
                  orphaned stranger."
               The old man placed his hand upon her head, and the cloud passed from his brow, as
                  he reverently said:
               "May the God of our fathers be with and protect you, my dear child. I shall
                  remember you tenderly, and pray for you earnestly. I trust that on earth your fate
                  will be happy, and in Heaven, may you shine as a bright angel beside your lovely
                  mother."
               At that moment Alina felt as if she would strive to deserve that blessing—she
                  turned away with tears in her eyes, and was clasped in a long embrace to the
                  maternal heart of Mrs. Rudolph. A few loving words were whispered, and she turned
                  and gave her hand to Rupert to conduct her to her horse. He placed her in the
                  saddle, and pressing her hand, said in a low voice:
               "I do not say much, Alina; but I am your fast friend, and that of my brother.
                  Beware how you trifle with so fiery a nature as his. Be true, as you value your
                  happiness."
               A flush crossed her cheek, and she spoke with some pique:
               
               "Then Michael has betrayed——"
               "He has betrayed nothing. I have only seen for myself. I only warn you of
                  possibilities—I can do no more."
               Captain De Vere, mounted on a coal black charger, magnificently caparisoned,
                  reined up beside them, and Alina could only say:
               "Thank you, and good-bye; I shall remember."
               She looked around for Michael, but he was nowhere to be seen; and hastily drawing
                  down her veil to conceal the expression of disappointment that swept over her
                  face, she waved her hand to the group in front of the house, and put her horse in
                  such rapid motion, that it required a pursuit of several moments before her
                  cavalier gained her side.
               Alina swept onward, heedless of the attempts of De Vere to open a conversation
                  with her. She replied to him in monosyllables, and did not pause in her rapid
                  career till they came to a cross-road, where Michael, mounted on a powerful roan
                  horse, sat quietly awaiting them. He had quite recovered his usual composure, and
                  with a smile, said:
               "While you were telling them good-by, I came by a short cut to this point. It is
                  necessary to take back your horse, and I preferred performing this last service
                  for you myself."
               The veil was lifted for a brief moment, and a flash from her beaming eyes thanked
                  him, though she said nothing.
               De Vere remarked:
               "That was well thought of, young sir; but since you have started with us, I would
                  fain take you on, and delegate to some other person the task of returning the
                  horses."
               "Whither would you have me go?" asked Rudolph, feigning to misunderstand his
                  meaning.
               "At such a crisis as the present, there is but one duty that is plain to every
                  loyal man. You should take up arms without delay."
               "Such is my purpose. I supposed you understood that already."
               "Embrace the bright side, and I offer you a position in my own troop. They are
                  bold rangers, well-mounted, and I think I can soon secure the office of sergeant
                  for so fine a fellow as you are."
               "Thank you," replied Rudolph, drily; but I hope to gain a higher position than
                  that in the corps to which I shall offer my services."
               "Higher? I think this would be a great step for a friendless young yeoman, who has
                  had no military training. You possess nothing to entitle you to a better position
                  than would be given to any other volunteer."
               "True enough; but it is all here, and it shall come out," said Rudolph,
                  significantly touching his forehead. "We shall yet measure swords, Captain De
                  Vere, and you will have an opportunity to see what nature has done for the
                  untutored country lad. I do not boast, but if my life is spared, I shall yet make
                  my name known as the defender of my country's rights."
               De Vere laughed scornfully:
               "To listen to the malapert braggadocio of the sons of this soil, one would suppose
                  that all they have to do is, to band together in predatory warfare, and drive the
                  veterans of old England before them! We may meet in battle, young
                  man, and then a lesson will be taught that will be long remembered."
               "I quite agree with you—but you and your brother officers will be the learners.
                  The struggle may be long, and at times disheartening, but men resolute to maintain
                  their independence must be victorious in the end."
               There was a calm, conscious power in the manner of the speaker, that elicited the
                  respect of De Vere, in spite of his desire to treat him as an inferior. The tone
                  in which he again spoke was less offensive:
               
               "I do not undervalue the courage of the Americans, for they are of the same race
                  from which I am myself descended; but I deeply regret this mad outbreak, leading,
                  as it must, to ruin to the people, and ending in their final subjugation."
               "You expressed the same opinion last evening, and I then told you that I have the
                  hardihood to differ from you. We can but try our strength, and leave the issue to
                  a higher power."
               Rudolph fell back, to avoid further conversation. His eyes followed the form of
                  Alina, and he remarked with pleasure that she seemed scarcely to reply to the
                  words addressed to her by the young officer. She had slackened her pace when her
                  lover joined them, but now she put her spirited steed to his best pace, and rode
                  onward as if seeking in rapid motion to still the unquiet thoughts that filled her
                  mind.
               At length they came in sight of the bay, with its restless waters glittering in
                  the sunbeams, and here and there a white sail 
                     fltting
                     flitting
                   over them. After skirting the shore a few miles, the little party
                  approached a sheltered cove in which lay a schooner at anchor. The English flag
                  was flying from the masthead, and De Vere pointed to it, as he said to
                  Rudolph:
               "There is the standard that will never be lowered at the bidding of a band of
                  black-hearted rebels. Its folds have sheltered all that is of promise to human
                  rights, and, God willing, it shall yet wave in triumph over this recusant
                  land."
               Rudolph, in his deep ringing tones, replied:
               "And God willing, the children of the grand old mother shall prove themselves
                  worthy to be her offspring. When she tries might against right, the great Jehovah
                  will be on the side of those who battle for all that is dear to man. I devote
                  myself to the forlorn hope, as you evidently think it, Captain De Vere, for I am
                  resolute to rise or fall with my country."
               "Then be the consequences on your own head. For the kindness of your family to
                  Miss Derval, her uncle would have made you his especial protegé. Your rise would
                  have been as rapid as your ambition could have desired, and thus Colonel Fitzhugh
                  would have repaid the debt he has incurred."
               "Let not the obligation burden him," replied Rudolph. "It is we who have been
                  favored by being of some little service to Colonel Fitzhugh's niece. We ask
                  nothing—will accept nothing as an equivalent for the courtesy we have been able to
                  show her."
               Alina here checked her steed, and putting back her veil, turned her face glowing
                  with the exercise of the morning, toward the speaker. She assumed her most
                  persuasive expression as she said:
               "Yet, Michael, if you would only listen to reason. If you would not be so
                  strong-willed in this crisis, it might be in my power to aid you to rise to your
                  true position. My uncle has power; let him use his influence in your behalf, and
                  you will at once be placed on the road to distinction."
               Rudolph regarded her steadily and mournfully. After a pause, which caused her
                  heart to beat painfully, he said:
               "After all that has passed, I scarcely expected such an appeal from Miss Derval.
                  Among my countrymen, I shall be considered an equal, though bearing a subordinate
                  rank; among those of Colonel Fitzhugh, I should still be regarded as an
                  interloper, and inferior, even after my tried gallantry entitled me to the highest
                  rewards. No—for the equal rights of man as man, I draw my sword, or
                  it remains for ever sheathed. Such is my irrevocable determination."
               He turned away his head that he might not see that pleading face, which it was so difficult to resist,
                  and while De Vere assisted Alina to alight from her horse, he busied himself in
                  removing the portmanteau in which was packed the few articles she had brought with
                  her. Two men appeared on the deck of the vessel, and hastened to put out a narrow
                  gangway, which rested on a projection of the shore. The path that led to it was
                  steep and winding, and De Vere assiduously aided the young girl in her descent.
                  Rudolph sprang over the bank, and stood ready to assist Alina to reach the deck;
                  but De Vere unceremoniously put him aside, and stepped with her on the frail plank
                  that vibrated in the most alarming manner. Suddenly the vessel careened slightly,
                  and Alina was precipitated into the water. De Vere had not presence of mind to
                  arrest her fall, and pallid and trembling he exclaimed:
               "I cannot swim—twenty pounds to him who will save the young lady."
               Before these words were uttered Rudolph had thrown off his coat, and was plunging
                  into the bay."
               "Lower the boat," shouted the captain. "Thar's an eddy thar, and they'll both be
                  lost without speedy help."
               Rudolph struck out with his powerful arms, but the seconds that elapsed before
                  Alina arose to the surface seemed to him an age. A dark speck appeared, then a
                  pale face with radiant hair falling in wet masses around it, gleamed an instant
                  above the waves, but it again sank from his sight just as his arms were stretched
                  forth to grasp her form.
               With a voiceless prayer for help in this extremity, Rudolph firmly closed his
                  lips, and dived after her. He succeeded in grasping her dress as she was again
                  rising to the surface, and they once more appeared to the straining vision of
                  those who were watching for them. The strong swimmer struck out manfully for the
                  shore, but he had been drifted out by the ebbing tide, and he felt that a powerful
                  counter current was drawing him into its vortex. A few more moments, and Rudolph
                  felt that his strength would not avail him against the power of this mighty foe,
                  and with one look of anguish upon the pale face that rested on his breast, one cry
                  for help in this extremity, he took what he believed to be his last look upon the
                  bright sun and fair world around him: then he was borne amid the strife of waters,
                  drifting at their mercy, though he still struggled to keep himself from sinking
                  with his precious burden.
               The boat, pulled with vigorous strokes, reached the spot just as they were
                  disappearing, and with a shout the captain grasped the hair of Rudolph, and with
                  the aid of his companion, drew him from the water, with Alina still clasped to his
                  breast.
               After a few struggles for breath, consciousness returned to him, and then his
                  first care was for her. She lay before him quite insensible, and his wild cry of
                  anguish was answered by the captain:
               "Never fear, youngster; she'll come round in a few minutes. I'll get her aboard
                  the craft, and my wife, who is a stunnin' woman to work, 'll soon bring her to her
                  senses."
               "She will not die! Tell me again that her sweet life is not gone?"
               "I tell ye she's only smothered i' the water she's swallered. Thar! hold her up a
                  bit, and by the time we git to Betsy Ann, she'll be all right."
               Rudolph lifted the drooping form, wrung out the wet locks of hair, and put them
                  back from her face. He saw that life was returning, for a faint motion of the
                  chest was perceptible, and a gleam of color came into the pale face on which he so
                  wildly gazed. By the time they gained the sehooner, Alina unclosed her eyes, and
                  looked around her; with a shudder she again seemed to relapse into
                     insensibility, and lifting her in his
                  arms, all his strength restored by the sight of De Vere standing there to receive
                  her, Rudolph sprang over the low bulwark, and brushing past the captain, strode at
                  once to the cabin, and placed his precious burden in the berth which Betsy Ann had
                  already prepared for her. She was a rough but kind-looking woman, who spoke
                  without ceremony.
               "All of you git out of the way now, and leave me alone with the young gal. Bring
                  her things in, Jake, that I may git some dry close for her; and you, Jem, make her
                  a stiff toddy, for gittin' inter the water sich a day as this, aint the best thing
                  for a body's health, ef the sun does shine so bright."
               The orders were speedily obeyed, for Betsy Ann was mistress both of the craft and
                  her captain. Rudolph retired with the others, though he would gladly have remained
                  till Alina had sufficiently revived to know what was passing around her. Jem
                  offered him a change of clothes, but this he declined, as his habits were too
                  hardy to endanger his health by suffering his own to dry on him. He resumed his
                  coat, and sat down in the sun to await the report from her he had saved at the
                  risk of his own life. After a few moments' hesitation, De Vere approached him, and
                  said:
               "To your gallantry I am indebted for the preservation of the young lady entrusted
                  to my care. Unluckily I cannot swim myself, or I should have made the effort to
                  save her. Here is the reward I offered for her rescue. It will help you on in your
                  new career, and you have nobly won it."
               At first Rudolph scarcely understood him, for his senses were yet confused, and he
                  looked up in surprise; but the sight of money offered him for the rescue of Alina
                  Derval fired every drop of blood in his body. He started up, confronted the
                  officer, and sternly said:
               "This is the second time to-day that you have insulted me by the offer of money
                  for services which have been freely rendered. If you were a gentleman by nature,
                  as you are one by birth, this would never have happened. Do you suppose that I
                  risked my life for your paltry gold? or that I would accept a reward from
                     you for saving one who——"
               His voice here faltered, and De Vere coolly put up the money, while he looked
                  fixedly at him, and said:
               "One whom you have the presumption to love; but remember what I now say to you,
                  and act on it. As well may you look with longing on the brightest star in the sky
                  above us, and hope to lure it down to earth, as to win the daughter of two noble
                  races to become the bride of a lowborn American woodman. The young lady has amused
                  herself at your expense, but the future will prove to you how little sincerity
                  there is in her professions of regard."
               He turned on his heel, and sprang on shore. The first impulse of Rudolph's
                  impetuous temper was to follow, and strike him; but respect for Alina withheld him
                  from such a course. He again confronted De Vere with pale, compressed lip, and
                  spoke to him with firm composure.
               "You have bitterly insulted me, assuming that your superior position gives you the
                  right to do so. The hour for a settlement has not arrived, but it will surely
                  come, and then the free son of a free soil will return you defiance for defiance,
                  blow for blow; and in that mortal combat, one or both shall perish."
               "Be it so," replied the Englishman, with haughty emphasis. "Win your spurs, young
                  man, that you may be worthy to cross steel with one who wears the uniform of the
                  greatest nation on earth. When your rank equals my own, although it may have been
                  gained in the cause of revolution, I will not balk your humor. I accept your
                  challenge à l'ou-
                  
                  trance, and shall hold myself ready for the
                  combat whenever the hour arrives."
               "I shall hold you to your pledge," and Rudolph returned to his former seat as
                  quietly as if this little interlude had not settled the preliminaries of a duel,
                  which must end in the sacrifice of his own life, or in taking that of his
                  adversary.
               What De Vere had said of Alina touched him deeply, for he bitterly felt the
                  uncertainty of the future with regard to her. She would be exposed to the
                  flatteries of others; among them, those of this insolent Englishman, and his fiery
                  soul chafed at the thought that she might smile on him, might give him her
                  friendship, even if no warmer feeling mingled with her regard. Rudolph was aroused
                  from his painful reverie by the voice of the captain's wife, who spoke close
                  beside him:
               "The young gal's better. She's come to herself, and is now sleepin' nicely. I give
                  her a spoonful of toddy, but she didn't seem to relish it much, though 'twas made
                  of real old Jamaky. I reckon it's 'bout time we was a gittin' off, for the sun's
                  mountin' up, and we must be at Havre de Grace before three o'clock. Are you a
                  gwine on, or do you go back?"
               Rudolph looked up quickly.
               "Then you will stop at Havre de Grace?"
               "We allers does that; our trade's mostly from thar."
               "Then I will bring my horses on board, and go that far with you. I wish to see the
                  young lady again before I take a final leave of her."
               "Well, that's f'ar, seein's how much you risked to git her out o' the bay. Onct I
                  thought you was both gone to Davy Jones' locker. That's what we say, you know,
                  when a body's drowned," she added, by way of explanation.
               The captain here joined them, and when he understood Rudolph's intention to go on,
                  he soon found a place on deck for his horses, which he regarded with an admiring
                  eye. He said:
               "These are jist the critters for cavalry—and they'll soon be in demand, I tell
                  you. Sich a stirrin' up among the people, you've never seen since you was born.
                  When I left Havre yistiddy, the whole town was alive, and sich a rakin' up of ole
                  muskits, an' cleanin' o' rusty swords, ain't been seen in these diggins since the
                  time o' the Injin wars."
               Rudolph listened with intense interest.
               "The people then are getting ready for the fight?"
               "I reckin you'll think so, when you git thar. Ole Maryland ain't so far behind the
                  Yankees. They're been the fust to bust up, and show the spunk o' the nation; but
                  we'll not be fur behind 'em I reckon, and sich a lickin's as the red coats 'll
                  git, will be a caution to 'em forever."
               Rudolph arose, and impulsively grasped the hand of the speaker. He warmly
                  said:
               "Then you too espouse the cause of your country?"
               "In course he does," responded Betsy Ann. "I'd like to see him take any other
                  side, as long as my name's Mrs. Jake Jenkins; not but what he's willin' enough to
                  do the right thing hisself."
               "You may well say that, Mrs. Betsy Ann," said the skipper, with an accent of
                  satisfaction. "But the day's gittin' on, and it's time we was startin.'"
               The vessel was soon under way, and De Vere, after inquiring after Miss Derval,
                  wrapped himself in his cloak and threw himself upon a bench; he was soon absorbed
                  in a book which he drew from his pocket, and after one disdainful glance at the
                  new passenger, he took no further notice of what was passing around him. He felt
                  sure of his power to remove Alina, and beyond that, he cared nothing ing for the bold backwoodsman who had so proudly
                  defied him. His lip curled in scorn as he recalled his words, but it would have
                  blanched to the hue of marble, if he could have looked into the future, and beheld
                  the tragedy concealed behind its friendly vail; for these three lives, so casually
                  thrown together, were to exercise an influence on each other most terrible in its
                  results.
               Rudolph sat watching the rippling waters, trying to bear with patience the long
                  hours that elapsed before Alina awoke from the sleep into which she had fallen.
                  Mrs. Jenkins had promised to inform her of his presence on the schooner, and his
                  desire for a parting interview. At length the good-humored face of the skipper's
                  wife appeared above the companion-way, and she beckoned the young man to approach.
                  As he did so, she stepped down the narrow stairway and by a gesture invited him to
                  follow her. This he promptly did, and when he stood beside her she said:
               "The young gal's ready to see you now. She seemed right glad to hear that you
                  hadn't gone off before she'd a chance to thank you. I'll wait here, while you go
                  in and talk a spell wi' her."
               Briefly thanking her, with some trepidation Rudolph unclosed the door and entered
                  the narrow cabin. Alina, wrapped in a large shawl, was leaning against a pile of
                  pillows, and her long hair was coiled around her head in loose bands held together
                  by a knot of black ribbon. She was extremely pale, and in her eyes was an
                  expression of vague terror that haunted Rudolph through many years of his after
                  life. She held out her hand, and softly said:
               "To you I owe my life; thanks for affording me an opportunity to express my
                  gratitude before we part for an indefinite time, perhaps forever."
               "Forever!" he repeated in terror. "What can you mean, Alina? Have I
                  not won the right to claim you as my own?"
               She withdrew her hand from his clasp, passed it over her eyes, and with effort
                  said:
               "I fell asleep in that sweet belief; but oh, Michael, in those hours in which life
                  was struggling back to my heart, I had a fearful dream, which was surely sent to
                  me as a warning."
               Her voice faltered, her lips trembled, and her emotion communicated itself to the
                  listener, though he proudly said:
               "I have no faith in the supernatural. I will have none in what may
                  tend to sever me from you. I have your promise, and I shall claim its fulfilment.
                  Tell me then, what was the nature of this dream that affects you thus."
               "A dream—yes—but it seemed a fearful reality," she whispered with a shudder. "My
                  mother stood beside me, stern and sorrowful, and she spoke these words
                  distinctly:—'My child, go upon your path unshackled. Be not the curse upon the
                  life of a noble and true man; save yourself from the sorrow that never dies; the
                  anguish of remorse born of blood guiltiness.' Her face was so sorrowful, yet so
                  terrible in its expression, her voice rang so startlingly in my ears, that I awoke
                  with the impression that she was really beside me. Oh, Michael, our love can bring
                  us nothing but sorrow—let us end our brief romance, and forget the vows we have
                  exchanged. We shall suffer, but we are too young to despair; time and change will
                  bring to us peace and forgetfulness."
               Rudolph listened with dilating eyes and compressed lips; he took both her hands in
                  his, and solemnly said:
               "Answer me as if in the presence of the All Father, Alina. Do you seek to evade
                  the vows we have plighted, from an unwillingness in your own heart to keep them?
                  If so, speak the truth, and you are free forever. My heart may break, but it will
                  never sue for love that is not fully and freely given."
               
               "I do love you," she faintly said, "but fate is against us. I shall be fatal to
                  you; let me go—let me go!"
               "Oh, Alina! can you know what love is, and yet speak thus?" he despairingly asked.
                  "To hope for you as my reward is the beacon light of my existence; to win you I
                  can do all, dare all. Take this from me, and I shall be nothing—nothing. Put this
                  fantasy from you, for it was but a dream, and should have no power to sway you in
                  so important a decision as the one which rests with you now. Speak! my fate is in
                  your hands."
               His deep excitement, the pallor of his face, the burning fire in his eyes, alarmed
                  Alina, and she feared to utter ail she had intended saying. Her voice was
                  tremulous, as she replied:
               "Such love as this is worth a life's devotion. The memory of my mother's solemn
                  words shall be cast into oblivion. I recall my prayer for freedom from the tie
                  that exists between us."
               Rudolph threw himself upon his knees beside her—he pressed her cold hands to his
                  burning lips and heart, while he poured forth a torrent of such passionate thanks
                  and blessings as moved all that was true and womanly in her nature.
               A tap upon the door interrupted him, and the voice of Mrs. Jenkins informed him
                  that Havre de Grace was in sight, and in a few more moments the schooner would be
                  at the wharf, where she would remain only long enough to receive a package of
                  letters for a commercial house in Baltimore.
               "Go!" said Alina, "be my hero; conquer the difficulties before you, and I will be
                  yours."
               "From this day I begin my career, never to rest till my reward is won," replied
                  Rudolph, with animation. "I will seek service in a corps which may take me whither
                  you are going. We shall meet under more favorable auspices, and in the meantime,
                  hope and action shall be my watchwords."
               Mrs. Jenkins, impatient at his delay, unceremoniously unclosed the door, and
                  entered the cabin.
               "I should think you've had time enough to be thanked a hundred times, Mister; an'
                  the schooner is runnin' in with a rush that'll bring her alongside the wharf in
                  two more minutes. You'd better be seein' after your hosses, ef you don't mean to
                  keep my man waitin' on you."
               A look of deep and tender meaning was exchanged between the lovers, and Rudolph
                  passed from the presence of Alina Derval to seek the turmoil of battle; to gain,
                  while yet a youth, the laurel of fame, and a position won in honorable and gallant
                  strife for the noble cause of freedom. She to pass beneath the influence of a
                  subtle and artificial woman, who finished what nature had begun, by making her as
                  worldly as herself, and far more unscrupulous.
               Alina again fell into a feverish slumber, and her broken dream was renewed. The
                  sorrowful face of her mother again appeared before her, and her voice seemed to
                  wail forth: "Too late—too late! Lost! lost! lost!"
               She awoke in a fright, and pondered on the double warning which forbade her future
                  union with her betrothed. At length, weary of thought, she resolved to let
                  circumstances take their own course, and be guided by them as they arose.
               On the following evening she reached Baltimore in safety, and was at once
                  transferred to the protection of Major Stanmore and his wife, who only awaited her
                  arrival to embark for Norfolk. After making some necessary additions to her
                  wardrobe, Alina was ready to accompany them, and no time was lost in setting
                  out.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE YOUNG SOLDIER.
               ON landing in the small town of Havre de Grace, the first thing that greeted
                  Rudolph was the sound of a fife playing a march to which a drum beat an
                  accompaniment. A band of rough but resolute-looking men was drawn up on the common
                  in front of the village, receiving their first lesson in military training from a
                  tall, finely-formed man in the prime of life, who wore the uniform of a militia
                  colonel, with a crimson sash tied around his waist, in which was thrust a pair of
                  highly ornamented pistols.
               His broad brow, firm mouth, and piercing eyes, showed that he possessed many of
                  the qualities necessary to a successful leader, and the clear, decided manner in
                  which his commands were uttered, showed that he was accustomed to rule others.
               Among the few books owned by Mr. Rudolph was a work on military tactics, which
                  Michael had studied from boyhood, and he looked on intelligently as the drill
                  proceeded. The eagle glance of the officer soon fell upon him, and he saw that
                  here was one superior to the common herd, who might be made useful in the future.
                  When his task was ended, he drew near the youth, and spoke in a friendly tone:
               "You appear to comprehend something of military affairs, my young friend. I trust
                  that you have been drawn hither by a desire to enter the service of your native
                  land? Am I not right?"
               Rudolph flushed, as he replied:
               "It is my intention to do so as soon as possible, but today I came hither on a
                  different errand. It is my purpose to join my countrymen in arms as soon as I can
                  arrange my affairs at home."
               "That is right; we need every patriot now to strike for the good cause. I am
                  helping to drill these men, but I shall not command them. I have a troop of
                  cavalry half formed, which I hope is destined to perform great deeds. You have a
                  pair of noble horses there, and could mount yourself so splendidly that I would
                  advise you to join them. I believe you are a son of Rudolph of the Glen? Your
                  father's good repute is well known to me, and it is a guarantee for the future of
                  his son."
               Deeply gratified by this tribute to his good father, Rudolph replied:
               "Nothing could suit me better than to serve under so experienced a commander as
                  Colonel Calvert. You have seen service in Canada, sir, and you comprehend the work
                  that is before us."
               "Aye, youngster, and mean to do it with right good will, too," was the animated
                  reply. "There must be no laggards in my troop; ready to move at all hours, and at
                  all hazards, must he be who takes service under me. With this understanding, you
                  will join me with the certainty that the most rigid discipline will prevail among
                  my troopers. I desire to command a corps of picked men, and I promise them
                  brilliant service."
               "And I, sir, ask no better opening than this. I will join you to-morrow, and
                  formally enrol myself in your troop."
               "Why not to-day, my young friend? When a good work is to be done, never put it off
                  till another day."
               "You are right, Colonel. I will join you at once, for I already have the
                  permission of my parents to join the forces that are rising in defence of our
                  rights. But I must return to the Glen to bid them farewell before setting out on
                  my campaign."
               
               "That is but right; enrol your name, and pledge yourself to present yourself here
                  three days hence, and you are free to make your parting visit to the old people. A
                  good son will be apt to make a good soldier."
               "I trust you will have no cause to complain of me when I have once learned my
                  duty," replied Rudolph, with the straightforward simplicity that characterized
                  him. "A man can but do his best, and I pledge myself to do that."
               "And I, on my part, pledge myself to be a good and careful leader to those who
                  trust themselves to my control. Come with me to my room at the tavern, where we
                  can have a few moments' uninterrupted conversation."
               Flattered by this invitation from a man of Colonel Calvert's standing, Rudolph
                  accepted it, and leaving his horses in charge of a boy, he followed him to an
                  old-fashioned house with a sign-board swinging in front, bearing upon its face the
                  likeness of George III., destined, before many months rolled away, to be changed,
                  by a few dexterous strokes of the brush, into that of a revolutionary general.
               Colonel Calvert strode on to his own apartment, replying briefly yet politely to
                  the crowd that filled the public room, and finally succeeded in closing the door
                  on a few of the more pertinacious who followed him even to its threshold, in the
                  hope of engaging him in a discussion of the stirring events of the hour.
               Colonel Leonard Calvert was a descendant of one of the old Catholic families that
                  first settled in Maryland. He was a man of varied experience, much judgment, and a
                  firmness of purpose that never wavered when once his course of action was decided
                  on. He had watched the course of the English government for the past twelve years,
                  and with prescient eye had foreboded the storm that was now ready to burst. Slowly
                  and reluctantly he made up his mind to the necessity of resisting the colonial
                  policy of the mother country, but he had long held himself in readiness to take up
                  arms at the first sound of the tocsin. In his youth, he had served a campaign in
                  Canada, and now, his long-disused military skill was promptly called into
                  requisition in the service of his country. He was raising, at his own expense, a
                  squadron of cavalry for the present defence of Maryland, but he intended in the
                  future to place it at the disposal of the commander-in-chief, when a necessity for
                  its services arose elsewhere.
               All this he briefly and clearly explained to Rudolph, and then, fixing his
                  piercing glance upon the face of the youth, he asked:
               "And now, understanding my intentions, are you ready to take service with me in
                  the capacity of a common soldier? You have intelligence, and must rise, but your
                  first essay must be among the rank and file."
               "I have no right to aspire to a higher position now, for I have everything to
                  learn," replied Rudolph, with simplicity. "I cannot expect to be entrusted with a
                  command till I have learned how to obey."
               "Right, my young friend," was the cordial response. "You are of the true metal,
                  and I see in you the making of a fine soldier."
               "Thanks, my colonel, I will endeavor to justify your good opinion. I shall enlist
                  for the war, and never leave my flag till peace is proclaimed."
               Calvert grasped his hand warmly as he replied:
               "With such a spirit animating the young men of the land, our cause is safe. Forced
                  to take up arms, we will never lay them down till our independence is secured, and
                  may the God of battles be with us."
               "Amen," responded Rudolph, and he took up the pen that lay on the table before
                  them and in a bold hand inscribed his name upon the roll. While he was thus employed, the door which opened into the
                  adjoining room was cautiously unclosed, and the head of a young girl appeared. At
                  a sign from Calvert she came in and stood beside him. She was not more than
                  fourteen years of age, but her figure was tall and well-proportioned, and her
                  brilliant black eyes, her raven hair, that hung in short curls around her graceful
                  head, and the vivid animation of her features, rendered her appearance unusually
                  attractive.
               When Rudolph finished writing, he looked up, and bowed in a natural and graceful
                  manner to the young lady.
               "My daughter—Miss Calvert," said the colonel, "and this young gentleman, Dora, is
                  one of whom you will approve, for he is about to join my troop. My daughter, young
                  as she is, is a determined patriot, Mr. Rudolph."
               Dora put out her hand with an expression of eager delight and impulsively
                  said:
               "Let me shake hands with you, Mr. Rudolph, and tell you that I like your spirit.
                  Oh! if I were only a boy, I would follow my father to the war, and be his page, as
                  the custom was in the days of chivalry. I have read all about those times, and I
                  have often wished that I had lived then, that I might have been the fair lady of
                  some gallant knighterrant. It would have been grand to place my colors on his
                  breast, and bid him God speed upon his way."
               Colonel Calvert laughed at the enthusiasm of his daughter.
               "We live in different and better times, my child. Now, men struggle for equal
                  rights, and not for some fantastic ideal of honor. The iron armor of the feudal
                  ages has been exchanged for iron will and firmness of purpose that will not be
                  baffled in its aim. But my young friend here will win his spurs all the same, and
                  when they are gained, you may play the part suited to your fancy, by placing the
                  laurel crown upon his brow."
               "And from fairer hands no knight could wish to receive it," said Rudolph, with a
                  deepening flush upon his cheek. "To fight in a noble cause, and win the smiles of
                  beauty, is guerdon enough for the noblest cavalier."
               Dora was evidently surprised at his tact, and graceful command of language, for
                  nature had bestowed on him a facility of expression for which he was little
                  indebted to the limited education he had received. She replied, with a gay
                  smile:
               "The commands of my father are always literally obeyed by me, and when the hour of
                  triumph arrives, I will not forget my misson."
               She bowed, exchanged a few words in a low tone with her father, and glided back
                  the way she had come. Calvert sighed as he said:
               "Dora is my all. She is spoiled and wayward at times, but she is the most
                  affectionate of daughters. My only regret in this turmoil is, that I must be
                  parted from her. And now that our business is ended, Mr. Rudolph, let us take some
                  refreshment, for I must return to Calvert Hall before nightfall."
               Rudolph declined this invitation, and parted from him with a promise to return at
                  the appointed time. He had twenty miles to ride before reaching home, and he could
                  well imagine the uneasiness his long absence had already occasioned in the Glen.
                  After taking a hurried lunch, he set out on his return, riding at times with
                  furious haste, and then slackening his pace almost to a walk, as his mind turned
                  toward the adored one from whom he had that day parted, till jealousy and doubt
                  again drove him onward in the mad pace of excitement.
               It was after nightfall when he drew up at his father's gate, where he found the
                  whole family watching for his arrival, and the voice of his brother hailed him at
                  once.
               
               "Is that you, Michael? Ah, old fellow, we began to think that you had run off to
                  enlist at once, and our mother has been in a pretty stew about you."
               "I was afraid she'd be uneasy; but you're not far wide of the mark, Rupert, for I
                  returned here to tell you all that I have become a soldier laddie."
               His brother laughed.
               "You are in a hurry to begin the career that is to make you a great man. I say,
                  Michael, when you are a prince, I hope you will make me at least a baron; but what
                     have you been doing to-day?"
               By this time they had reached the door, in which Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph stood
                  waiting them.
               "I have enlisted in a cavalry troop which Calvert of the Hall is raising, and I
                  join my company day after to-morrow. Was I not right, father, to seize the
                  opportunity to serve under so true a man and so tried a soldier?"
               "Right—of course, lad; who will question your judgment in making so fine a
                  beginning. Colonel Calvert is a noble man, and a gallant officer. With him, I
                  shall feel that you are in the right way to distinction. Come in to supper, my
                  boy, and tell us all the particulars. Your mother has been worrying about you all
                  the afternoon, and wondering what detained you so long."
               "You are safe, and I am contented," said Mrs. Rudolph; "but you must be tired and
                  hungry, my son. Come in and take supper before telling us of your adventures."
               Michael did not need pressing, for the keen air and his rapid ride had given him a
                  good appetite, and after partaking of the abundant fare set before him, he related
                  all the occurrences of the day, save his defiance of De Vere, and the interview
                  between himself and Alina. Neither did he tell them how near he had come to losing
                  his own life in his attempt to save her, though his mother grew pale and trembled
                  as he described his plunge into the bay.
               "Where was Captain De Vere, that he left you to rescue Alina?" she asked.
               "Oh, he was busy taking care of himself, and shouting out that he would pay any
                  one that would do what he couldn't do himself," was the bitter reply.
               His father looked at him, and said:
               "And he offered you money again? Was it so, lad?"
               "It was, sir; but he knows better than to attempt it again," was the significant
                  reply. "As long as he lives, Captain De Vere will remember what I said to him
                  to-day. How noble a contrast is Colonel Calvert to this proud Englishman—one is
                  the aristocrat of nature, the other, of chance."
               "Come, tell us all about him, lad. I knew Calvert of the Hall many years ago, and
                  a true gentleman he has always been."
               "He remembered you, sir, and spoke of you so kindly that my heart warmed to him.
                  His daughter came in while I was with him, and although she is yet a child, she
                  seems as full of fire about the times as her father is."
               "His daughter? she must be quite young. There was a son, who was a reckless youth,
                  and deeply involved his father before his death. The mother was an heiress, but
                  she was very eccentric, and spent large sums of money in every kind of
                  extravagance while she lived. Now, the colonel is about to finish the old acres by
                  getting up a company at his own expense. Your outfit shall cost him
                  nothing, at any rate, my boy, for I can afford to send at least one soldier to
                  defend the land in which I have gained a home."
               "One soldier?" asked Rupert. "Is Michael to do all the fighting, when I am the
                  elder? That is hardly just."
               
               "One son must remain at home, unless the demand for men becomes so stringent as to
                  call every true patriot to take up arms. The land must be tilled, that our
                  soldiers may be fed, and you can do as good service on the farm as in the
                  battle-field."
               "I submit to your superior judgment, father, but while following the plough, I
                  shall listen for the bugle call, and when I think it time to go, I too, must
                  shoulder my knapsack."
               "So let it be, my son. If your services become necessary I will endeavor to do
                  without you, but it would be too hard on your mother to ask her to give up both
                  her children at once."
               A tear stole down Mrs. Rudolph's cheek, but she firmly said:
               "I can give them both to their country if need be. In this hour it is the duty of
                  every man to sustain the cause of freedom, and my sons shall not be laggards in
                  the strife. Rupert shall go or stay as seems best to him, and I will pray that the
                  shield of a just cause be over both my precious ones."
               Thus it was finally settled, and throughout the following day such preparations
                  were made for the departure of the youngest born as would, as far as possible,
                  assure his well-being. The finest horse in the stable was selected for his use,
                  and Mr. Rudolph brought from some secret receptacle several hundred dollars in
                  gold, which he had hoarded from his yearly savings. A sufficient number of these
                  were bestowed on Michael to enable him to purchase the outfit necessary to a
                  trooper, and to start in his new career without becoming a source of expense to
                  his commander.
               Throughout that last day the youth lingered near his mother as much as was
                  consistent with his more active duties. Through the pale calmness of her face he
                  saw the tender heart struggling with the heroism which dictated the sacrifice she
                  was ready to make for the sake of honor and patriotism; and he loved and
                  reverenced her more deeply than ever.
               In the evening they went together into the little room lately occupied by Alina,
                  and there she gave him her last tender counsels. Toward the close of the
                  interview, she said:
               "Before you go forth to mingle in the turmoil of the world, Michael, I must warn
                  you of a portion of the astrologer's prediction which has not hitherto been spoken
                  of. Events seem to tend to a fufilment of a portion of them, then why not of
                  all."
               She paused, and Rudolph impatiently asked:
               "What then has been withheld, and why have you not before told me the whole?"
               "Because my judgment told me that it was not well to cloud your youth with
                  presages of sadness. Success in arms, but failure in love, was predicted. Domestic
                  calamities, fatal to your peace, were foretold connected with one you would madly
                  love. Fatal events were to spring from your first passion; but your
                     second one would bring you a brilliant marriage, and the love of a
                  true and noble woman."
               Rudolph laughed scornfully:
               "I repudiate all the nonsense the old dotard wrote. A second passion
                  for me! There is no room in my heart for any but Alina, and I will wed her or
                  none. Second love for me—for me, whose every hope in life is set upon
                  this single cast! Mother, forbear; utter not such dishonor to your son, as
                  faithlessness to her to whom he is bound by every tie of truth and affection.
                  Alina, the bright star of promise, declared the cause of bitter suffering and
                  humiliation to me. Never, never! I love her, I have faith in her, and I refuse to believe in the idle words uttered over
                  my cradle. Put them from you I charge you as you love me, for they are a great
                  wrong to her who will become my wife."
               With heaving breast, clenched hands, and flashing eyes, these rapid words were
                  uttered, and Mrs. Rudolph listened in appalled silence. There was a pause, during
                  which Michael struggled to gain the mastery of himself; at length he spoke, in a
                  calmer tone:
               "Pardon my violence, mother, for I see that it has moved you deeply; but this idle
                  prophecy has taken too deep a hold on your imagination. I have youth, strength,
                  courage—and they shall win my way. The blessing of my life shall not be turned
                  into a curse, by the demented croakings of an old madman. But what is to be the
                     end, mother? He told you that too, I suppose, as soothsayers
                  seldom leave their work unfinished until the grave is gained."
               "No," replied Mrs. Rudolph, in a low, pained tone; "he did not complete his work.
                  He placed you on the pinnacle of fame and prosperity, and wrote these words: 'The
                  Life Curse will work her spells with fatal power through many years of his life;
                  but while the web of fate is weaving, he shall win all that man can ask. The end
                  let no man reveal, for God will develop all in His own good time.'"
               Rudolph laughed bitterly:
               "Truly the end is worthy of the beginning. My joy, my hope, my inspiration is then
                  to become the curse of my life! Oh, stupid and lying prophecy! I cast ye to the
                  winds! I will prove ye false as the heart that imagined such a future for an
                  innocent babe! Mother, where is that paper? let me burn it, and forget all it
                  pretends to reveal; for I swear to reverse all its predictions so far as Alina is
                  concerned in them!"
               "I trust that you may be able to do so, Michael. Here is the chart; I brought it
                  here to show it to you before you leave your home, and take on yourself the
                  responsibilities of manhood."
               She drew from her pocket a sheet of paper, yellowed by time, and worn at the edges
                  where it was folded. Rudolph opened it, and scanned the page of strange
                  hieroglyphics that met his gaze; they would have been utterly unintelligible but
                  for sentences in writing that at intervals partially explained their meaning. From
                  these his family had gleaned the high destiny foretold for him with its
                  accompanying drawbacks. An eagle symbolized himself, and throughout he was
                  followed by a falcon, that struck at intervals upon his breast, and buried her
                  talons deep within it. The last had written above it in several places: "The dark
                  Shadow," "The Fate," "The Life Curse."
               An expression of intense and bitter scorn crept over Rudolph's face as he glanced
                  over the record which had been so long and so carefully preserved. He
                  contemptuously twisted it together, and holding it above the flame of the candle,
                  said:
               "Thus perish the idle dreaming of an unsound mind! Phœnix-like, my fate shall
                  arise from its ashes, purified from the foul dregs of evil and wrong which the
                  astrologer dared to mix up with it. Do not mourn over its destruction, mother, for
                  I will weave for myself a better future than was there foretold."
               Mrs. Rudolph watched the curling flames with regret, for she had dwelt upon those
                  mystic pages many hours in her life, and pondered on the strange predictions it
                  contained with a growing faith in their eventual realization; but she made no
                  effort to stay his hand. The paper concerned Rudolph alone, and he possessed the
                  right to destroy it, if it was his will to do so; and, after all, it might be
                  folly to believe in the improbable destiny it foreshadowed for the son of an
                  American backwoodsman.
               
               On the following morning, Rudolph bade a long farewell to his home, bearing with
                  him the blessings and prayers of his mother. He set out for Havre de Grace mounted
                  on his noble steed, and supplied with ample means to provide for his wants for
                  several months to come; with buoyant heart he started forth on that career, which,
                  in time to come, was to make him known as "bravest of the brave" among men of
                  world-wide fame.
               His father and brother accompanied him to Havre de Grace, where they found Col.
                  Calvert busily engaged in enlisting recruits for the service he had undertaken.
                  The young aspirant for military honors was cordially received by him, and the old
                  father was gratified by the prediction of the tried soldier that his son would
                  speedily win promotion by his gallantry and good conduct. The troop was already
                  nearly filled, for the young men of the county eagerly sought to join the standard
                  of one who would speedily lead them into active service. The most of them were
                  fearless riders, accustomed to use the rifle with unerring skill, and Calvert
                  confidently believed that a few weeks' training would suffice to render them
                  efficient in the field.
               At the moment of final parting, Mr. Rudolph placed his hand in solemn benediction
                  upon his son's head, and said:
               "Be a good and true man, Michael, and fight to the bitter end for the cause of
                  freedom; and may the God of our Fathers be with you in the hour of peril, to
                  protect and save you from all harm."
               Did this prayer of a good man shield him amid the storm of bullets that so often
                  rained around him in those days when he rode like Mars unscathed through the
                  battlefield? It may be that it did, for throughout his brilliant career, he
                  scarcely received a wound of importance.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               ALINA'S NEW HOME.
               ALINA DERVAL soon recovered from the effects of her plunge in the bay, and under
                  the supervision of Mrs. Stanmore, such additions were made to her wardrobe as
                  would enable her to appear with proper credit in her new sphere. Deep mourning is
                  not often becoming to its wearer, but her sable robes seemed to give additional
                  brilliancy to the delicate fairness of her complexion, and her ruby lips, bright
                  eyes, and magnificent hair, fairly entitled her to the epithet of "charming" which
                  her new friends applied to her. Major Stanmore and his wife were well-bred English
                  people, who sought by their kindness to remove the forlorn feeling which they felt
                  her isolated position must inspire; and they made the young stranger speedily feel
                  that she was no longer a waif thrown upon the world, without friends on whom she
                  had a claim.
               Alina knew very little of her uncle's domestic affairs, and she eagerly sought to
                  gain from Mrs. Stanmore such information as would be useful to her in the new
                  scene on which she was about to enter. She ascertained that his wife had been dead
                  for many years; and his only child, a daughter about ten years of age, was under
                  the charge of an accomplished French lady, who also superintended the domestic
                  affairs of Col. Fitzhugh's family.
               "In fact," said Mrs. Stanmore, "Madame Girand is virtually mistress of his house,
                  and I fancy that she will, in due time, be installed in the place of your deceased
                  aunt. She is still a very handsome woman, and is exceedingly attractive in
                  society; she speaks English perfectly, and is a brilliant musician. You will be
                  fortunate, my dear, in having so
                  elegant a person to train your natural grace, for the triumphs your beauty will be
                  sure to win."
               Alina smiled brightly at this compliment, but she demurely said:
               "I have not been thought beautiful, madame. My father has often lamented that I
                  was so little like my mother in that respect; and they both impressed on me that
                  if I succeed in society, it must be through my wit, and not my personal
                  charms."
               "Ah, that was well enough in your childhood, because it kept you from becoming
                  vain; but you will develop into a splendid woman; though not regularly beautiful,
                  you are piquant, graceful and interesting. Madame Girand will know how to bring
                  out all your latent charms, and teach you how to make the best use of them."
               "Then my uncle seems to have made a fortunate selection of a governess for my
                  cousin and myself. Do you know much of Helen? Is she spoiled, or is she a pattern
                  child?"
               "Well, I believe Helen is a little of both. Her father spoils her, and Madame
                  tries to make her what, in my opinion, no child should be made, a miniature woman.
                  Luckily one counteracts the other, and your cousin will probably develop into what
                  nature designed her to be, a good and lovely woman."
               "And this lady, who may become Col. Fitzhugh's wife, who is she? and how has she
                  been reduced to the necessity of taking charge of my uncle's family for a
                  support."
               "Madame Girand is the widow of a French officer, and a woman of good family
                  herself. That is all I know of her history. I have warned you of probabilities,
                  that you may understand at once the course it will be best to pursue. Girls of
                  your age are often inclined to be headstrong, but I would advise you to pursue a
                  different line of policy, for Col. Fitzhugh will put down rebellion with a strong
                  hand, and Madame Girand possesses his entire confidence."
               Alina calmly replied:
               "I think I see my way clearly in the new life before me. I thank you for your
                  judicious cautions, and I shall be sure to be guided by them. Madame Girand will
                  not find me an intractable pupil, for I desire to profit by her instructions as
                  far as possible, as it is my wish to become a brilliant woman of society."
               "So much the better, my dear. This lively French-woman will soon initiate so apt a
                  pupil into all the fascinations she knows how to practice so well herself. Only
                  show her that you are docile, and you will be mutually charmed with each
                  other."
               After a pause, Alina asked:
               "Is Captain De Vere also a member of my uncle's family?"
               "Yes, he forms a part of his military household. There are several other young
                  officers attached to his corps, who eat at his table. You will find no lack of
                  admirers in your new sphere, but you must not let these gay young men turn your
                  head by their flatteries. In good time your uncle will find a suitable match for
                  you; but you are much too young to think of marriage for several years yet."
               Alina blushed slightly, and her thoughts flew back to the passionate scenes though
                  which she had lately passed. She sunk into a reverie, and pondered on the
                  uncertain chances in favor of the ultimate realization of her lover's hopes.
                  Already she dreamed of new conquests, vainly laying the "flattering unction to her
                  soul" that admiration from others would not of necessity impair her fidelity to
                  him. Her heart was guarded, and her actions Rudolph would not be near to criticize
                  or condemn. Then why should she not grasp the glittering baubles of excitement and
                  pleasure as they arose upon her path,
                  and leave the future to take care of itself? Her fate had now passed beneath the
                  control of others, and she would not hold herself responsible for the turn affairs
                  might henceforth take.
               De Vere was greatly struck by the improvement made in her appearance by her new
                  and fashionable attire, and he soon began to feel that in herself she was
                  deserving of the attentions he had resolved to bestow upon her as a means of
                  rivalling the rustic bore who had so deeply piqued him. He had no intention of
                  falling in love with her, for it did not suit his views to marry a dependent and
                  penniless girl; but he fully intended to show her the wide difference between a
                  dashing officer of the royal army and the unpolished son of a colonial farmer. He
                  would play the part of the lover, without coming to the point of asking her hand,
                  and his vanity flattered him that the rivalry he meditated would not be very
                  difficult to accomplish.
               In the daily intercourse into which they must be thrown, he would have
                  opportunities to commend himself to her favor, of which he intended fully to avail
                  himself; though he merely designed to detach Alina's thoughts from her first
                  lover, and show her how much higher her ambition might soar in the future that lay
                  before her. He rightly judged that she was not one to sigh long over a dream of
                  broken love, and she who had proved faithless to one adorer could, in her turn,
                  find a solace for his own ultimate defection in the conquests she would be sure to
                  win.
               But after events proved to De Vere that it is not often safe to play with edged
                  tools, even if they are wielded by the hand of a master. Alina was by nature a
                  consummate coquette, and she at once comprehended and foiled the part he intended
                  to play towards her. She alternately piqued and flattered him till it became a
                  question with him whether this untutored country girl would condescend to share
                  the future grandeur of the heir to a baronetcy, sustained by a large
                  inheritance.
               In the flirtation that ensued, both players were equally skilled in finesse, and
                  with bitter pique, the young man felt that his fair antagonist was quite a match
                  for himself in the dangerous game they were playing; and try as he would, he could
                  not even gain the assurance that she had relinquished all thoughts of the country
                  bumpkin, as he contemptuously styled Rudolph.
               But this culminating point was the growth of time, and in the interim Alina
                  progressed in her knowledge of the world, and made good use of the lessons she
                  received from her competent instructress in the art of pleasing.
               The party embarked for Norfolk, and after a tedious voyage, interrupted by a
                  severe gale which at one time threatened the vessel with shipwreck, they reached
                  their harbor in safety.
               Lord Dunmore was still in authority as royal governor of Virginia, and Col.
                  Fitzhugh was in command of one of the forts which controlled the entrance to the
                  river on which the town of Norfolk is built. The fort consisted of earthen walls,
                  mounted with cannon, which surrounded an esplanade in which stood the houses of
                  the officers and the quarters of the soldiers.
               Virginia had not yet assumed a hostile attitude toward the mother country, though
                  Lord Dunmore, by his intemperate measures, was doing all in his power to arouse
                  the resistance of the people. Until very recently, Col. Fitzhugh had occupied a
                  house in the town, but the mutterings of the approaching tempest warned him that
                  it would be safest to remove his family to the fort, where they would be safe in
                  case of an outbreak among the people; though they still maintained social
                  relations with those who had hitherto found his house a pleasant place of
                  resort.
               
               Fort Norfolk stands upon a tongue of land separated from the town by a narrow
                  stream, over which a draw-bridge was thrown that could be raised in case of an
                  attack from that side; and it was protected in the rear by a morass over which
                  artillery could not be drawn. Several ships of war were lying in the stream,
                  prepared to hurl their iron missiles on the town if any attempt were made by the
                  inhabitants to throw off the authority of the British crown.
               The transport in which Major Stanmore and his little party had embarked passed
                  under the frowning cannon that projected from their port-holes, ready at a
                  moment's warning to launch destruction on the city. A few months later, the
                  tyrannical governor and his suit were compelled to take refuge on these ships, to
                  shelter themselves from the rage of an outraged and indignant people.
               The transport fired a gun as a salute and run up the cross of St. George, which
                  was responded to by a gun from each ship; she then rounded to beneath the walls of
                  the fort, for the purpose of landing the passengers and stores she had
                  brought.
               A tall, stately-looking man, with a spy-glass in his hand, stood upon the parapet
                  watching the motions of the approaching craft. His face was strongly marked, and
                  his mouth and lower jaw firm as iron; both his hair and eyebrows were already
                  gray, though he had scarcely reached middle age. A handkerchief was waved to him
                  from the deck of the vessel by Mr. Stanmore, to which he gallantly responded by a
                  flourish of the glass he held in his hand, and, leaving his post, he descended to
                  greet his newly arrived friends. With firm tread and eagle glance, Col. Fitzhugh
                  approached the group collected near the gangway, and as De Vere advanced to meet
                  him, he rapidly said:
               "You have accomplished your errand, I trust, and have brought my niece with
                  you."
               "There she stands beside Mrs. Stanmore."
               "What! that young lady my little Alina! truly, three years have marvellously
                  changed her."
               Making a rapid and graceful salute to Mrs. Stanmore, he passed on, and taking
                  Alina in his arms, said with emotion:
               "Welcome, my child, to your uncle's heart and home. As soon as I heard of your
                  bereavement I took measures to take you under my own protection, and now, thank
                  heaven! you are safe beneath my care. Regard me as a father, Alina, for such it is
                  my purpose to be to you."
               Alina thanked him sweetly, and as she glanced in his bronzed face, she thought
                  that, after all, her uncle was not so formidable a personage as her imagination
                  had painted him. In a few more moments they were walking arm in arm up the bank,
                  followed by the rest of the party.
               Major Stanmore and his wife stopped at their own quarters, and Colonel Fitzhugh
                  and his niece passed on to the upper end of the esplanade, where stood a
                  commodious house, with a colonnade in front, supported by massive pillars. This
                  was the residence of the commandant, and in the doorway stood a lady and child
                  ready to welcome the young stranger.
               Madame Girand came forward with much empressement, and taking Alina's hand, imprinted a kiss upon her
                  brow. In a sweet-toned voice she said:
               "We have looked forward to your arrival with much pleasure, Mademoiselle. My sweet
                  Helen has also been most impatient to welcome you."
               Helen, a dark, gipsy-looking child, with eyes of flashing brightness, and an
                  expression of premature intelligence, shyly put out her little brown hand.
               "You are to be my new sister, papa says. I am glad you have come, for it is dull
                  since we came to the fort to live."
               
               "Poor child," said Madame Girand, "she misses her young associates sadly. We have
                  only been in the garrison a few weeks, Miss Derval, and I must say that I, too,
                  regret the interruption of our pleasant, social intercourse with the inhabitants
                  of the town. However, we are not quite cut off from them yet, though I do not know
                  how long we may be permitted to enjoy the pleasure of associating with them."
               "As long as they remain loyal to their king, Madame, and not an instant longer,"
                  said Colonel Fitzhugh, with decision. "Let us enter the house, for my niece has
                  had a rough voyage hither, and she will doubtless be glad to repose a few
                  hours."
               The few words Alina spoke in reply to the kindness lavished upon her, were
                  graceful and well chosen, and the impression she made on her new friends was
                  extremely pleasing. Madame Girand pronounced her charming, and Helen concluded
                  that she should really like her, while Alina herself had as carefully scanned
                  them, and with her natural acuteness, aided by Mrs. Stanmore's previous hints, she
                  rapidly made up her mind as to her future relations towards them. She thought:
               "I will flatter my uncle, and make him like me; with the Frenchwoman, I shall get
                  on well enough; but Helen will be a nuisance to me that I must tolerate on account
                  of her father's kindness. I wish she was a boy, for then she would not be so much
                  in my way, nor be able to spy upon me, as she will do, I know."
               Madame Girand ushered her into the comfortable apartment prepared for her, which
                  opened into her own room, and after dismissing Helen, sat down beside the couch on
                  which Alina threw herself, and talked with the graceful ease of a Frenchwoman
                  desirous of producing a good impression. Alina watched her graceful movement, the
                  expressive play of her mobile features, and she was not surprised that her uncle
                  had been captivated by the bright intelligence which formed their chief charm.
               Madame Girand was a woman of thirty-five, petite
                  in form, and full of fire and activity, with great command of language, and an
                  intellect of unusual grasp, which had been carefully cultivated. She was fully
                  imbued with all the dangerous philosophy of the era in which she had received her
                  training, and was familiar with the literature of that epoch. She placed reason on
                  the throne of religion, and contended with animation that the hour would arrive
                  when man would prostrate himself before its divine majesty, and offer his homage
                  at the only shrine worthy of his worship. In good time that hour did arrive to her
                  countrymen, and the bloodiest record in the annals of crime was its legitimate
                  result.
               Colonel Fitzhugh, no very strict churchman himself, listened with an incredulous
                  smile to her eloquent declamations, too much charmed by the grace of the speaker
                  to scan their subversive tendency, and left her free to impress her ideas on the
                  plastic minds entrusted to her guidance. He believed it to be of very little
                  consequence what women thought, for he had the innate conviction that their sphere
                  is only a domestic one, and the natural instincts of a pure woman would correct
                  such erratic tendencies as would compromise her happiness.
               It would be quite as safe to administer poison, because an antidote is at hand
                  ready to counteract its effects; and one, at least, of these young souls was to
                  illustrate the fatal effects of the lessons she too readily imbibed.
               A strict bond of union soon grew up between the teacher and the pupil, and Madame
                  Girand was enchanted to find Alina so capable of profiting by her instructions.
                  She learned with facility, and her skill on the harp, and her pure French accent soon equalled that of her
                  preceptress, but the inward deterioration kept pace with the external improvement.
                  She lost the guiding star of life, in surrendering the simple faith her mother had
                  given her for this new found philosophy, and she who inculcated it would have been
                  startled and shocked, could she have beheld the first fruits her training would,
                  in time, produce.
               The mode of life to which Alina was now introduced, was in striking contrast to
                  that to which she had hitherto been accustomed. Her mornings were passed in study,
                  to which she arduously devoted herself; but she appeared at dinner in the toilette
                  of a young lady, and received the attentions of the officers with the graceful
                  ease of one much more practised in society. The arrival of a gay and coquettish
                  girl at the fort was soon known on board the ships in the harbor, and in a few
                  weeks Alina Derval could have claimed nearly all their more youthful officers as
                  captives to her subtle power to charm.
               To her grave uncle, it was an amusement to see how she played them off against
                  each other, though he warned her not to attach too much importance to the
                  flatteries they whispered in her ears. She answered his caution in such a manner
                  as convinced him that young as she was, she knew how to take care of herself as
                  well as if the wisdom of age had been joined with the fresh charms of early
                  youth.
               Helen found that Alina was no companion for her, for all her time was occupied in
                  her studies, or in society, and she soon ceased to exact any attention from her,
                  though the little girl kept an observant eye upon her, and often made most
                  mal-apropos reports of her cousin's flirtations.
               As summer approached, the wide drawbridge became the theatre of these, for every
                  evening the ladies from the garrison promenaded on their side, while those from
                  the town came upon the opposite one, to listen to the well-trained bands on board
                  of the ships, and to discuss the news of the day.
               Occasionally the two parties mingled together, but soon the difference in
                  political feeling caused each one to keep to its own side, and thus Alina Derval
                  became the cynosure of attraction to the English officers who were now coldly
                  received by the young ladies of the town. There, in the light moonlight, fanned by
                  the soft summer air, she held her little court, and took especial pains to show De
                  Vere that his attentions were of less importance to her than those of half-a-dozen
                  others.
               At times, he was enraged, and vowed within himself that he was perfectly
                  indifferent to her; that so finished a coquette was unworthy of a thought; but
                  still he did think about her more and more, until he ended by becoming the most
                  infatuated of her adorers. One evening she had slighted him more than usual, and
                  enraged at his own weakness, he moodily leaned over the railing of the bridge
                  watching the current as it rippled by, and trying to make up his mind to think no
                  more of this incomprehensible creature, whose Protean changes bewildered and
                  fascinated him more deeply with every passing hour.
               The various groups had dispersed; the naval officers had returned to their boats,
                  and Alina lingered behind her uncle and Madame Girand for the purpose of affording
                  the moody young man an opportunity to join her. As she passed him, she hummed a
                  tender air which she knew was his favorite one, and unable to resist the flattery
                  thus indirectly offered, De Vere turned and joined her. After a pause, he bitterly
                  said:
               "I fancy that young clodhopper, who risked his life to save yours not very long
                  ago, would have been amazed and enraged, if he had seen you to-night in the midst
                  of those idle young men, smiling on all—flirting with all alike."
               
               Alina laughed mockingly:
               "I do not know that he has any more right to be angry than you seem to imagine you
                  possess. It is something new for you to espouse the cause of Rudolph, but you are
                  mistaken if you think that I am bound to him because he saved me from
                  drowning."
               "Do you then mean to say that there was nothing between you? that he did not part
                  from you without some hope for the future? Tell me the truth, Alina, for I must
                  have it."
               "Must! that is rather imperative, and I do not acknowledge your right
                  to fathom my affairs. But I will say this much in reply: it would be an idle and
                  silly dream on my part, to fancy that fortune can ever place my young preserver in
                  a position to claim my hand. He loves me, perhaps, better than any one else ever
                  will, and in the moment of parting I was too weak to evade his passionate
                  protestations as I now should. Let this explanation suffice."
               "Then you have cast his pretensions to the winds! Eureka! that much is gained at
                  least. This impertinent youngster has found his true level in your regard, and I—I
                  may hope."
               "Hope—for what?" asked Alina, with fire. "To gain a place in my heart, when your
                  proud English relatives would spurn the thought of an alliance with a portionless
                  and dependent girl! Nay, Captain De Vere, I am too proud for that."
               "Your family is equal to my own, and my father is rich enough to dispense with
                  fortune in the object of my choice. You are charming enough to excuse a man for
                  any folly he may commit for your sake."
               "So—you admit that it would be a folly. I quite agree with you; so pray let this
                  discussion end. It can produce no good result to either of us."
               De Vere walked by her side, endeavoring to stifle the wrath that mastered him. At
                  length he said:
               "I will not consider this decision as final; if you have a heart, which at times I
                  doubt, I will find the means to touch it yet—to bend it to my will; for I swear
                  that no woman shall baffle me as you have hitherto done. The fate that threw us
                  together will yet work out its own purposes, for I feel assured that your future
                  and my own are bound up together."
               "If so, it will not be for good to either of us," replied Alina, with a slight
                  tremor in her voice, which he was eager to interpret to his own advantage. "You
                  would find upon your path one who will never submit to be rivaled by you. I am
                  already warned of that."
               "Then I was not wrong. Rudolph has gained some pledge from you which gave him the
                  right to utter such a warning."
               "Why speak of that childish folly? It is past, and in a measure forgotten. I think
                  of Rudolph only as a friend. I am too young to dream seriously of love. I frankly
                  own that I like to be admired, but the flattering speeches made to me I rate at
                  their true value."
               "Yes, you are young in years, but old in craft and dissimulation," replied De
                  Vere, bitterly. "Yet I, who fathom your nature thoroughly, cannot escape from the
                  thrall in which you hold me. What power is it that enables you to bind me to you,
                  and torture me at your will?"
               Again Alina's mocking laugh rang out, and she said:
               "Perhaps my power springs from sympathy of nature. We are not unlike, Captain De
                  Vere, and in the struggle between us, the strongest will must gain the mastery.
                  Conquer me if you can; I throw down the gauntlet, and defy you to the
                  contest."
               "I accept the gage," he responded, almost fiercely, "and I feel that I shall win. You will lead me a fearful
                  dance, but the end shall be victory. As to the threats of my rival, I cast them to
                  the winds. If he thinks an alienated heart worth fighting for, I will not balk
                  him; in the seas of blood about to be shed, the life of one man can matter little
                  in the account."
               Alina shuddered and grew pale. She said:
               "This is utter madness; I cannot become the cause of strife between you and one to
                  whom I am so deeply indebted as to Rudolph. Let this matter drop; we are friends,
                  and nothing more; too wide a gulf separates your fate and mine, to be bridged over
                  by idle hopes that can never be realized. Good night, Captain De Vere; I shall
                  forget all that has passed in this interview, and I advise you to do the
                  same."
               She smiled, kissed her hand lightly to him, and disappeared within the house,
                  which by this time they had gained. De Vere turned moodily away, muttering:
               "Forget! as if that were possible. No, my dainty queen, I will not
                  forget—nor shall you escape me. Elude me as you will, double as you may on your
                  tortuous path, the passion you have kindled in my heart shall yet meet its return.
                  I will not be baffled in this pursuit, though it may be madness to
                  follow it up. Madness! yes it is the hight of folly to pursue such an ignis
                  fatuus; but this girl lures me on, then taunts me, slights me, yet winds me to her
                  purpose with the skill of a demon, while wearing the smile of a seraph. She will
                  not refuse to become Lady De Vere, and therein lies my strongest hold upon
                  her."
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE YOUNG MARPLOT.
               WHILE the conversation with De Vere proceeded, Alina had not observed that Helen
                  had also lingered behind the others, though she walked near enough to the two to
                  have been noticed by them had they not been too deeply absorbed in their
                  conversation to be aware of her presence. Helen heard every word they uttered, and
                  although there was much she did not understand, she comprehended the general drift
                  of the interview well enough for her purpose. In the family Helen was considered
                  an enfant terrible, for she was frankness
                  itself, and she invariably revealed openly the secrets she discovered.
               She looked very sagacious at the breakfast table, but she restrained herself till
                  they had retired to the library, in which their studies were carried on. Colonel
                  Fitzhugh usually spent a few moments with them before going out to attend to his
                  more active duties, and the young marplot waited till this time to speak of the
                  discovery she had made on the previous night. She placed her lips near her
                  father's ear, and said in a loud whisper:
               "Papa, do you know that my cousin has two lovers?"
               "Only two, Helen? I thought that at least half the young officers who visit here
                  belong to Alina by right of conquest."
               "Oh, yes—they make fine speeches to her, but these are real lovers, for they are
                  ready to fight each other for her sake."
               "Fight for her! that would be serious indeed. Do you hear what charges this young
                  eavesdropper is bringing against your adorers, Alina?"
               
               Alina listened with deep annoyance—she flushed deeply as she replied:
               "Helen has insatiable curiosity. She has overheard some nonsense, and
                  misinterpreted it: that is all."
               Helen fired up at this insinuation, and quickly responded:
               "I know this much at least—you have a lover whose name is Rudolph, and he has
                  threatened Captain De Vere's life if he rivals him with you. There—didn't I hear
                     that last night from his own lips? See how you are blushing. Papa
                  can see from your looks that I have told the truth."
               Colonel Fitzhugh surveyed his niece with keen scrutiny, and he deliberately
                  said:
               "So—Helen has touched a real train of powder, sure enough, but the match is not
                  yet lighted, and the explosion may be prevented. Rudolph? He is the son of the
                  kind family that took you in when you most needed protection. I hope my little
                  girl has not exerted her fascinations in that direction, for I would not have her
                  branded with ingratitude toward those good people, and it is quite impossible for
                  her to be anything to them in the future."
               "Nor is such my own wish," replied Alina, in a low voice. "The person in question
                  is almost a boy in years, so you see what nonsense all this is."
               "But De Vere was jealous of him, that gives some color to his pretensions. You are
                  too young to think seriously of marriage yet, but the captain is a man to whose
                  attentions I should not object when the right time comes. Remember one thing,
                  Alina; this young rebel is quite out of the question, even if he were your equal
                  in other respects. I should never willingly receive into my family one who has
                  taken up arms against the mother country."
               "Have no fears on that score, sir," replied Alina, now looking clearly and
                  tranquilly in his face. "I have no idea of accepting the vows of this young
                  countryman. If you knew what a boy he is, you would feel how absurd it is to warn
                  me against him. I dare say the passing attraction he felt toward me has already
                  been forgotten by him, as it had been by me till the idle talk of Captain De Vere
                  recalled him to my mind."
               "He must be rather a desperate youngster to threaten a royal captain," replied her
                  uncle, with a laugh; "but since your heart is safe, there has not been much
                  mischief done."
               Alina recalled her parting interview with Rudolph, and a thrill of fear and pain
                  shot through that false nature, though she coolly responded:
               "Have no fears for me, uncle. I can manage my own affairs with prudence, and be
                  assured that when so serious a thing as marriage is in question, I shall be guided
                  by the advice of my friends."
               "That is right, my little woman. You are too attractive not to be admired, and it
                  pleases me to see you attended to, but you must not forget that the sentimental
                  nonsense these young men entertain you with is but the foam on the wave of life,
                  whose sparkling glitter would be lost if you attempted to grasp it as a tangible
                  reality."
               "I understand that perfectly, and shall guide myself accordingly."
               "I must say, child, that you have an old head on young shoulders. Your tact is
                  really wonderful."
               "Tact?" asked Helen. "What is that? for I am sure I have not the least idea what
                  it means."
               "Nor will ever have, I am afraid," said her father. "You are too downright to
                  practice anything of the sort, Helen. You and your cousin are as opposite as the
                  two poles of an electric battery."
               "Is that the reason she always repels me?" was the quick response.
               
               "What a scientific young lady you are, to be sure; but you must not say that your
                  adopted sister repels you. Alina will love you, if you permit her to do so."
               "But she doesn't love me. She never plays with me, and she never caresses me as
                  you and Madame do, and when I follow her she finds some excuse to send me
                  away."
               "Because you follow me only to spy on me, and repeat what you have learned, as you
                  have done this morning," retorted Alina, resentfully. "I dare say I should be very
                  fond of you, if you would attend to your own affairs, and let mine alone."
               "Would you? Well, I will try and be very good, to-day at least; but you know, coz,
                  I am the positive pole if I am either, and I have no tact, so you
                  must excuse me if I forget."
               "Helen, let your cousin alone, and learn your morning lessons," said Col.
                  Fitzhugh, with authority. "This discussion has lasted long enough, and I desire
                  that you will cease to annoy her. Madame Girand and myself can watch over her,
                  without any assistance from you. There, my daughter; I am not offended with you,
                  but get to work—to work, for that is the grand harmonizer of life."
               Helen grasped his hand as he passed her on his way from the room, and held up her
                  lips for a kiss.
               As he stooped forward to bestow it, she whispered:
               "I'll let her alone if you are vexed; but it is such fun to teaze her, and then I
                  have nothing else to amuse me in this dull place."
               He shook his finger at her, and replied, in the same tone:
               "You must forbear, my little girl, or Alina will never love you, and I wish you to
                  be sisters in affection. Your cousin has neither father nor mother, brother nor
                  sister, and we must be all these to her."
               Helen nodded her head gravely; but when the door closed on him, she turned her
                  eyes curiously upon her cousin, and wondered in her childish way, if Alina felt
                  the need of the tender ties to which her father had referred. She shook her curls
                  gravely as she came to the conclusion that her adopted sister cared for nothing
                  but admiration, and Helen made many sage resolutions to suffer Alina to pursue her
                  course unmolested—resolutions she soon found it impossible to keep, for her quick
                  observation could not be baffled, and her tongue would chatter of what she
                  saw.
               This scene is but a specimen of many that occurred, and it required all the tact
                  of Madame Girand, and all the calm good sense of Colonel Fitzhugh to prevent open
                  warfare from being declared between the two. Alina, as the elder and the
                  dependent, felt that she must restrain the expression of her resentment; but it
                  only sunk deeper and gained more intensity, from this enforced self-control. She
                  tolerated Helen, but in her heart she detested her, and panted for the hour to
                  arrive in which she could be freed forever from her espionage.
               In the three years that followed her entrance into her uncle's family, Alina
                  matured into a beautiful and precocious woman of the world. She thought of her
                  first dream of romance with a smile of disdain, though at long intervals she still
                  continued to receive letters from Rudolph, breathing the same ardent affection,
                  the same trusting hope in the future, with which they had parted. She knew that he
                  had gained brilliant distinction under Col. Calvert; that by his daring courage,
                  and exquisite strategical ability, he had already risen to the rank of captain;
                  and sometimes the fear that he would really acquire the right to claim her troth,
                  thrilled her with a vague dread which she could not conquer.
               De Vere did not relax in his devotion, and a skilful game was played on either side, ending, as such
                  things are apt to do, in the complete enthrallment of both parties. Alina's
                  ambition, her worldliness of nature, were gratified by the contemplation of the
                  future that would open to her as his wife, and she soon felt too secure in her
                  power over him to fear the influence his family might exert against their
                  union.
               Yet De Vere was far from gaining from her any assurance that he was beloved. The
                  same inexplicable enchanting enigma she continued to be to him as in the first
                  days of their acquaintance; and in this lay the spell of her power. She knew that
                  if once assured of her attachment, De Vere would cease to value it as the first of
                  blessings, and she only gave him glimpses of hope, which lured him on from day to
                  day in the pursuit of one he had well named an ignis
                     fatuus.
               
               During those years Col. Fitzhugh had been removed from the command of Fort
                  Norfolk, and placed in active service. Mrs. Stanmore's predictions were verified
                  with regard to Madame Girand, for she became his wife before he placed himself at
                  the head of his regiment. When Philadelphia fell into the hands of the British, he
                  removed his family thither; and Alina, then in the first radiant flush of
                  womanhood, participated in all the gaieties of that brilliant winter—the last
                  sparkle of the British crown before its fairest gem was torn from it by the sturdy
                  freemen who struck for the rights of men.
               At this time Alina was an exquisitely lovely creature. Her form had rounded into
                  perfect symmetry, and her face had gained a mingled expression of spirit and
                  intelligence, which harmonized with her fearless bearing and sparkling wit.
                  Wherever she appeared, other women, far more worthy to be loved, were thrown in
                  the shade by her brilliant attractions, and the fair Derval became the idol of the
                  hour.
               But amid this intoxication, Mrs. Fitzhugh did not permit her to forget her true
                  interests. She kept constantly before her the necessity of preserving the devotion
                  of De Vere, for he was the best match she could hope to win in the western world.
                  He was the eldest son of a baronet, who was old and in feeble health, and the heir
                  to great wealth. De Vere could place her in the proudest position to which she
                  could aspire, and thus tutored, Alina guarded her conduct toward her lover so
                  carefully, that she only made him wretched without positively exciting his
                  jealousy.
               "My dear," remonstrated Mrs. Fitzhugh, "are you not carrying things a little too
                  far? De Vere is moody and hard to manage of late. You try him too severely: he
                  tells me that he can gain no positive pledge from you."
               "What more can he ask?" replied Alina, with a curling lip. "Does he not guard me
                  like a Cerberus, and look ferocious if I but smile on my partner in the dance? I
                  understand my part, believe me, and I intend to play it out to the end. If Captain
                  De Vere were sure of me, he would cease to care about me. It is
                  because I puzzle and vex him continually that he thinks of me: I understand the
                  art of angling, and this man requires all the skill of her who would eventually
                  secure him in the matrimonial net."
               The listener laughed, as she replied:
               "I give up to your superior finesse. You have gone beyond my teachings, and proved
                  yourself mistress of Arts. Only become Lady De Vere, and I shall be
                  contented."
               "It is my purpose to marry him when his father gives him the power to make me my
                  lady. In the meantime I enjoy my youth, and amuse myself; that is enough for the
                  present, is it not?"
               "For the present, yes; but give your poor sighing swain a little more hope, for he
                  begins to look as if he is dying of
                  that 'green and yellow melancholy,' of which Shakespeare sings."
               "Alina's mocking laugh rang out, and she said:
               "'Men have died, and worms have eat them, but not for love.' However, I will bear
                  in mind what you have said, and take measures to put the captain in a better
                  humor."
               Helen came in reading a paper she held in her hand. She spoke with animation:
               "Here is something that should interest you, cousin, for it concerns that young
                  Rudolph who once made such desperate love to you."
               Alina grew slightly pale as she asked:
               "What is it, Helen? Is he wounded?—or—dead?"
               "No, indeed. He seems to be one of the fire spirits that pass unscathed amid the
                  fiercest tumult of battle. Here is the paragraph—I will read it:
               
                  "'It is rumored that a select body of troops has been formed under the
                     supervision of Washington himself, consisting of several hundred infantry, and
                     horse in equal proportions. The men were picked from the army, and the officers
                     carefully selected with regard to their peculiar talents. Among the latter, is
                     Captain Rudolph, who has already distinguished himself by his daring bravery
                     and strategic skill. This young officer has risen from the ranks, and bids fair
                     to become a great military chieftain. The brave partisan, Lieutenant-Colonel
                     Lee, is to command the legion, and we may look for such gallant exploits from
                     them as will bequeath their deeds to undying fame, and enrol their names among
                     the most successful defenders of their country's rights.'"
               
               "Why, Helen, you must have got hold of a rebel newspaper," exclaimed Mrs.
                  Fitzhugh; "for such a paragraph as that was never admitted into one of ours."
               "So I have," said Helen, exultingly. "Willie Stanmore got it for me. It is a
                  dingy-looking little sheet, but it shows that these people are in earnest, and
                  mean to fight to the bitter end. Don't you wish to see Rudolph's name in print,
                  Alina? Here it is. If I were you, I should like his gallantry better than the
                  devotion of somebody else, who wastes his energy in sighing, and leaves fighting
                  to more martial spirits."
               "Helen," said the warning voice of her step-mother; "I am afraid, my child, that
                  your spirit is too belligerent for one of your sex. Why do you so often say to
                  your cousin what you know must wound her?"
               "I thought Alina as invulnerable as Achilles," replied Helen, "but from a
                  different cause. My cousin does not care enough about her royal captain to feel
                  anything I may say of him."
               And this, at the present moment, seemed true, for Alina had scarcely listened to
                  Helen's words; she hurriedly grasped the paper, and was deeply absorbed in the
                  paragraph, her thoughts flitting back to that distant time which she so vainly
                  tried to bury in oblivion. At intervals, the image of Rudolph would rise vividly
                  before her, and the solemn form of betrothal by which she had bound herself to
                  him, caused her to shiver before the power over her fate which she had thus given
                  him. She felt that he would yet demand its fulfilment; that he would avenge her
                  inconstancy upon his rival; and in place of rejoicing in Rudolph's success, she
                  deprecated the thought that he was so rapidly placing himself in a position to
                  claim the pledge she had given him. Helen watched her face, as she said:
               "I do believe you are sorry, that your old friend has distinguished himself."
               "No," replied Alina, haughtily; "I care very little about it. Captain Rudolph is
                  of no more interest to me than any
                  other country lad who was known to me in my childhood. If he had espoused the
                  right cause, it might have been otherwise; but now our fates are too widely
                  sundered ever to bring us near each other again."
               Even while she spoke these words, Alina would have given much to be able to
                  believe in them herself; but a thrilling presentiment that her future was in some
                  way unhappily linked with that of Rudolph, remained in her soul and possibly
                  influenced the events of her after life.
               A few days afterward, she received a letter from Rudolph filled with passionate
                  protestations of undying love, and exultingly anticipating the time when he should
                  win the right to claim the hand of his betrothed. Alina read it with a sickening
                  heart, but she had not the courage to reveal to him the sad fact that her feelings
                  were completely alienated from him. She rarely ventured to reply to him; for in
                  the uncertain state of the country, the mails seldom reached their destination;
                  and how Rudolph contrived to send his letters, was a mystery to her.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               DORA CALVERT.
               THE years which have passed over Rudolph since we last looked on him, have matured
                  him into a striking looking man. His tall, martial figure, high and well developed
                  forehead, straight eyebrows, shading eyes of a deep, clear gray, and his firmly
                  cut, yet gentle mouth, reveal the salient points of his remarkable character.
               Gentle, tender and true, his distinguishing traits were great personal bravery,
                  unparalleled coolness in the hour of danger, and a soundness of judgment in
                  military affairs, which enabled him to profit to the utmost by the mistakes of his
                  adversary. In action, rapid as a thunderbolt, yet calm as Fate itself, nature had
                  bestowed on him two qualities usually deemed incompatible with each other. He
                  never lost the equal balance of his mind, even in moments of deadly peril, but
                  serenely surveyed the battle-field with the eye of a master, and swept down upon
                  the foe at the moment that victory was certain.
               In spite of his youth, Rudolph's great talents were soon recognised, and they
                  received the meed justly due to them, in speedy promotion. Under Colonel Calvert
                  his first laurels were won, and at Calvert Hall a portion of his furloughs were
                  spent. There he was received as a welcome and cherished friend, for the old
                  soldier had conceived for him one of those strong attachments which are almost
                  paternal in their character, and Dora's enthusiasm for her youthful hero more than
                  kept pace with that of her father.
               Dora had grown into a bright and animated girl, with little that was conventional
                  either in her nature or her manner. She was very independent in her ideas, and had
                  established a code of action by which she was invariably guided. Those who had
                  known her mother, declared that Miss Calvert was quite as eccentric as that lady
                  had been, but beneath all Dora's peculiarities, lay a deep fund of true womanly
                  feeling, which would keep her in the right path, even if love and happiness were
                  to be sacrificed upon the shrine of duty.
               It was a bright evening in May—four years from the day on which Rudolph had first
                  assumed the garb of the soldier, when he drew near Calvert Hall to pay a passing
                  visit to his late commander. Colonel Calvert was slowly recovering from the
                  effects of a severe wound received in one of his gallant encounters with the
                  enemy, and with deep chagrin he felt
                  that he was unfitted for further active service. He reluctantly consented to give
                  up the best of his brave troopers to swell Lee's celebrated Legion, which
                  afterwards rendered such efficient service to the country; but he felt that he was
                  an invalid for life, and warmly recommending Rudolph to promotion, he resigned his
                  authority over his attached partizans.
               The slanting sunbeams fell upon the massive walls of the old house, built in the
                  Elizabethan style, of bricks brought from England. It stood in the midst of an
                  extensive woodland, kept with such care as to resemble an English park, and the
                  evening sun-light cast flickering gleams of brightness upon the undulating surface
                  now covered with the vivid verdure of spring.
               Preparations had been made for a little festival, to welcome the guest whose
                  arrival was so eagerly anticipated, and Dora stood on the piazza in front of the
                  house, surrounded by a group of young girls. She held a laurel wreath in her
                  hands, which her own skillful fingers had twined.
               "Who is this for?" asked a young girl, extending her hand toward it.
               "Hands off, Lizzie; no one touches this but myself, till I place it where it
                  belongs, on the brow of a hero. Wait, and you shall see, what you shall see."
               "Dora, you are the strangest girl! It must be for your father, for he is the only
                  hero I know about here. The young men all go to the war, and so few come back,
                  that I begin to think we shall never have any more beaux. Here are six young
                  girls, and not a gentleman to pull caps for."
               "It will not be so long, for one is coming who is worthy of a struggle, I assure
                  you," was the merry answer.
               "Who is it—tell us—tell us," was eagerly spoken by the different voices
                  around.
               "It is the young captain in the Legion, the protégé of my father, who has shown
                  such distinguished gallantry in every engagement he has been in."
               "Captain Rudolph, the son of the old farmer who lives in the Glen?" asked Betty
                  Mansel, the daughter of a tory gentleman in the vicinity who was noted for his
                  pride. "Brave he may be, and doubtless is, but Colonel Calvert's daughter steps
                  from her level when she twines a wreath for a yeoman's son."
               The eyes of Dora flashed, and the warm blood leaped into her cheek, as she
                  said:
               "Beware, Betty, how you use such words now. The time has come to weigh worth
                  against wealth, and the proudest aristocrat in this land may bow his head before
                  patriotism and valor."
               Miss Mansel curled her lip, and turned away without a reply. She drew with her one
                  of the young girls, and when beyond the hearing of those they had left, she
                  scornfully said:
               "I do believe Dora Calvert is in love with this young man; and no wonder, for her
                  father has made the most absurd fuss about him and his exploits. One would think
                  him a second Bayard."
               "So he is, if report speaks truly," was the reply. "I believe Colonel Calvert
                  would be quite satisfied if his daughter made such a choice; that is, if Captain
                  Rudolph should fall in love with her."
               "If! Of course he would be only too glad to grasp at such a chance to
                  place himself among the gentry of the county; but if Dora can so far forget her
                  station as to accept the son of old Rudolph of the Glen, I for one shall cut her
                  acquaintance."
               The listener half smiled, but she gravely said:
               "You had better not make up your mind too soon. Who knows but this young officer may become a general,
                  or a military dictator. I have heard that a great destiny was predicted for him in
                  his childhood, which he seems in a fair way to realize."
               "I don't care for that; he is still the son of those low foreigners that came here
                  to escape starvation in their own country."
               "I believe we are all descended from foreigners who sought this as a land of
                  promise; and besides, I have heard that Mrs. Rudolph is a woman of good family.
                  They are excellent people, and universally respected."
               "Oh, I dare say; people are always respectable as long as they pay their way, and
                  do nothing that entitles them to punishment; but there is a wide step between
                  respectability and high social position, such as the Calverts have always held. It
                  is incredible that Dora should lower herself so much as to get up a fête for
                  Captain Rudolph. If I had known that such was her object in bringing us together,
                  I should have declined her invitation."
               "It is not yet too late to return to your home, for the hero of the fête has not
                  yet arrived," was the mischievous response. "It will be easy for you to escape
                  taking part in our ovation to a revolutionary captain."
               "I could do so, but Dora would be offended; so I suppose I must remain, and
                  witness the absurd scene about to be enacted," and the speaker turned moodily
                  aside.
               In the meantime Dora had sprung down the steps, and crossed the lawn toward a
                  summer-house, which stood in a grove of trees a few rods from the mansion. The
                  door was open, and just within it, in a large chair, sat Colonel Calvert, the mere
                  wreck of the stately man who had so nobly raised the standard of freedom at the
                  first uprising of his countrymen. He had lost his right arm, and a severe wound in
                  his body had caused partial paralysis of the lower limbs, from which he was slowly
                  recovering.
               Never again would he martial his battalions in the battle-field, and join the
                  sacred strife for home, honor, and father-land. His strong frame was wasted to a
                  skeleton, and his dark hair had blanched to silver whiteness in the years of
                  hardship, toil and suffering which had passed over him since the fierce struggle
                  commenced; yet his heart was undaunted as ever, and his faith in the final
                  independence of his country unshaken. Dora threw herself upon a cushion at his
                  feet, and raised her bright face to his, as she elevated the wreath she still held
                  in her hand, and asked:
               "Is it not beautiful, and worthy of him for whom it is designed?"
               A smile crept over his wan face as he said:
               "You have a tenacious memory, my daughter. Is it really your intention to carry
                  out the pledge you gave Rudolph on the day you first saw him?"
               "Assuredly—I always fulfil my promises, and in this my——"
               She paused abruptly, colored and looked out over the lawn with the vague
                  expression which reveals that the inner sense takes no cognizance of what the eyes
                  rest upon. The father regarded her with a penetrating glance, and presently he
                  resumed the unfinished sentence in a tone of such gentle tenderness that the young
                  girl did not shrink from the words he uttered.
               "In this, your heart is interested? Is it not so, my daughter?"
               Dora took his pale hand in hers, pressed it to her lips and bending her flushed
                  face over it, said:
               "Oh, my father, he is noble and true; he is a grand man, and worthy of the love of
                  any woman."
               "And he has sought your love? My daughter would never give her love unasked?"
               
               A deadly pallor swept over Dora's cheeks, and she faltered:
               "We are the best of friends, but he has never spoken of love. That he could not do
                  without some encouragement from you; for Rudolph has too much pride and
                  self-respect to seek the daughter of his early friend and patron, without his
                  consent."
               "He is all I can ask in a son. I will open the way for him to speak if he is
                  attached to you."
               "Oh, my father, how shall I thank you? You have made me very, very happy."
               After a pause, Colonel Calvert said:
               "Dora, do you know that your own sweet and loving heart, will be nearly all the
                  dower you can bring to your future husband! The old acres have dwindled away, till
                  only a few are left around the Hall as your inheritance; and the aged negroes that
                  are on the place will soon be an encumbrance, in place of a help. Our fortunes
                  have fallen, and men may say that Calvert of the Hall has given his daughter to a
                  rising man to ensure her future prosperity."
               "I care very little about what the world may say. I shall know that you have given
                  me to one worthy of the devotion of my life. Oh, my father, to be the chosen
                  companion of one born to so noble a destiny, is to wear a crown of joy, brighter
                  than the diamond coronet of a queen. He will take me for what I am truly worth,
                  and together we will build up name and fortune in the future. I can be a true
                  helpmate to the man I love, and my dower shall be youth, hope, strength to do all
                  for his sake."
               "There spoke the heroic blood of your race, my child; and I know full well that
                  you can be all you promise. My feeble and helpless age will be blessed indeed,
                  with two such children to smooth my pathway to the grave."
               "Father, speak not thus; you are not old; you are but feeble from your wounds, and
                  already the hue of returning health is upon your cheek. Your steps are less
                  uncertain, and soon you will walk among us restored to the enjoyment of life."
               "It may be so, my love, and that is much to be grateful for, but never again shall
                  I be able to grasp my sword and rally to the battle cry," said the veteran. "If I
                  could have fought out the good fight, I should have died contented in the arms of
                  victory. As it is, I am but a worthless hulk, fit only to be cared for as a
                  child."
               Dora arose, threw her arms around him, and laid her soft cheek to his.
               "Dear father, you are still strong to counsel, clear in mind, undaunted in heart,
                  and your name is honored among the defenders of the right. Let that suffice, for
                  soon the struggle must be ended, and the fame that you have already won shall
                  obtain for you honor and respect from all."
               "You are a tender comforter, my child; with the independence of my country
                  established, you settled in a happy home of your own, my work on earth will be
                  finished; then I can say to the great Jehovah, 'Lord, I am ready for thy
                  summons.'"
               "But I shall be by no means ready to give you up, for you must witness and share
                  my happiness," replied Dora, tenderly. "We will live together in the Hall, and in
                  time, regain the lands that have passed from us. Industry, economy and good
                  management, can accomplish even this, and I intend to be the pearl of good
                  housewives."
               The father smiled fondly upon her. He passed his hand caressingly over her hair,
                  and seemed absorbed in thought. In a few moments the tramp of a swift rider was
                  heard approaching, and a powerful bay horse bearing an officer, dressed in the
                  blue and buff uniform of the continentals, was seen winding through the long avenue that led to
                  the house.
               Dora sprang down the steps, collected her fair visitors in a group in front of the
                  summer-house, and gave the signal to a party of sable musicians placed in the rear
                  of the building, who played "See the Conquering Hero Comes," to their own infinite
                  delight, and the further disgust of Miss Mansel, who regarded the scene that
                  ensued with cold and critical eyes.
               A boy had been placed upon the road to direct Rudolph to the summer-house, which
                  was decorated with spring flowers, and seemed indeed a temple of Flora, for the
                  fair maidens each held a basket of flowers to cast upon the path of the
                  approaching guest.
               Rudolph, bronzed with service, flushed with exercise, and radiant with pleasure at
                  the thought of meeting his tried and valued friends, threw himself from his horse
                  a few yards from the little temple, and with an expression of diffident surprise,
                  drew near.
               Dora, robed in snowy muslin, with the national colors, red, white and blue,
                  knotted together upon her sleeves and bosom, with the starry flag of freedom
                  floating over her head, stood upon the steps with love and welcome beaming from
                  her eyes.
               Colonel Calvert beckoned him to approach, and entering at once into the spirit of
                  the scene, the young soldier moved forward with free elastic step, bent his
                  stately head, and received the girlish offering, while the attendant nymphs
                  scattered their flowers profusely upon his path. Dora said:
               "Honor to him to whom honor is due. Captain Rudolph, the wreath promised in our
                  first interview has been fairly won, and I thus redeem my pledge."
               "And I, fair lady, return my grateful thanks for this unlooked looked for welcome.
                  Little have I done to merit such honor; but it is not the less dearly prized as
                  the offering of noble and generous friendship. This little memento shall be
                  cherished throughout my life as its sweetest triumph."
               He lifted the hand of Dora to his lips, turned and bowed gracefully to her
                  companions, and then placing the wreath upon the point of his sword, lowered it
                  before Col. Calvert, as he advanced to grasp his outstretched hand in the manly
                  clasp of tried and faithful friendship. He warmly said:
               "Welcome, my dear boy; you have gallantly fulfilled my predictions, and I am
                  thankful that I have given to my country one officer trained under my own eye, and
                  formed by my counsels. It is some consolation to know that, through you, I can
                  still do something for the cause so near my heart."
               "To you, dear sir, I owe all that I am," replied Rudolph, with emotion, for he was
                  deeply moved at the change in his old friend. "But for your early recognition of
                  such ability as I possess, I should not so soon have gained the position I now
                  occupy."
               "Do not thank me, lad, when God himself has stamped you as one of His
                  chosen instruments. You have won, by your own prowess, the distinction of being
                  appointed a captain in the new legion, and that is sufficient honor for the
                  present. The future will give you something more substantial than Dora's symbolic
                  offering."
               "Yet that will ever be considered the most precious distinction of my life,"
                  replied Rudolph, pressing the laurel crown reverently to his lips; and the heart
                  of the father bounded with pride and gratification, for in those words, uttered
                  with such fervor, he thought there breathed a declaration of attachment to his
                  daughter, as true and lasting as she had avowed for him.
               
               Dora and her fair companions drew near, and Rudolph was presented to each one in
                  due form. With ready tact he uttered a few gallant sentences, and even Miss Mansel
                  was moved from her cold dignity, and marveled where the yeoman's son had learned
                  the arts of polite society. Had she ever seen his gentle and refined mother, she
                  would easily have comprehended that early training had as much effect in producing
                  this result as his subsequent association with those of high social position.
               At a signal from Miss Calvert, the musicians struck into a march, and, leaning on
                  his young friend, Col. Calvert led the way across the lawn, followed by the young
                  girls. In the wide hall a table, tastefully decorated with flowers, was spread,
                  and over the two seats at the upper end, several flags were draped in long
                  festoons held in place by wreaths of the wild rose. The effect was very graceful,
                  and when the bevy of young girls gathered around the board in their white dresses
                  and gay ribbons, the scene resembled a Mayday festival.
               Light and joyous was the flow of conversation, and Dora performed her duties as
                  hostess with the ease of one long accustomed to the duties of her position. When
                  supper was over, the party adjourned to the old-fashioned parlor filled with
                  heavily-carved furniture, and adorned with old family pictures.
               As the evening wore on, the services of the musicians were again called into
                  requisition, and the merry group danced till midnight, a playful struggle going on
                  among the girls as to which one should have the honor of leading out the only beau
                  among them, and the roguish fun with which Rudolph played the part assigned him,
                  contributed no small share to the enjoyment of the hour.
               Dora long remembered this evening as the last sparkle of her glad young life; she
                  shone brilliant in animation and joyousness, for in her heart was the fond belief
                  that Rudolph loved her even as he was himself beloved. No whisper of his
                  attachment to Alina Derval had ever reached her ears, and in the years of frequent
                  intercourse since he had become known to them, his gentle kindness, his brotherly
                  solicitude for her welfare, had completely misled the impassioned girl as to his
                  true sentiments toward her. Her love had been the growth of years, and now it was
                  entwined with every hope of the future, while he held firmly in his heart the
                  false one who was ready to betray him for another.
               Alas! this was but another illustration of the cross purposes of life. We see
                  indeed "through a glass darkly," and in our blindness lay violent hands upon the
                  ark of safety that might have borne us triumphantly over the tumultuous waves of
                  life.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               LOVE ME, OR I PERISH.
               TOWARD the close of the evening, Dora, radiant, triumphant, stood at the head of
                  the room holding a blue scarf in her hand, on the ends of which a laurel wreath
                  had been embroidered by her own dainty fingers. With a gesture of imperial power
                  she addressed Rudolph:
               "I give you my colors, adorned with the symbol of your own prowess. As the dames
                  of old chose a champion, I choose you as my Knight, sans
                     peur et sans reproche. Bring back this trophy when the struggle that
                  now convulses the land is ended, and claim your reward. To the successful victor
                  nothing can be refused that lady fair may honorably grant."
               The last words were spoken almost in a whisper, but Rudolph distinctly heard them, and he glanced
                  quickly toward Dora to meet her expressive eyes filled with tender light. In that
                  moment all was revealed and he shivered beneath the shock of this unexpected
                  discovery. If, for a brief moment, his vanity was flattered, in the next instant
                  his true manly feeling conquered the emotion, and dread, sorrow, and dismay filled
                  his heart. He measured all love by his own heroic standard; for him, there was but
                  one woman in the wide world to whom he could offer the devotion of his heart, and
                  he feared that Dora was sufficiently akin to him in spirit to love but once, and
                  then with all the ardent impulsiveness of her nature.
               The reproachful thought came to him that he should have confided his betrothal to
                  her, and thus have guarded her from the chance of misplacing her affections; but
                  how could he have imagined that such a guard was necessary to the proud daughter
                  of a patrician race? He had never once dreamed that Dora Calvert would stoop to
                  bestow her love upon the protégé of her father.
               The hot blood rushed to Rudolph's brow; Dora saw the flush, and believed it to be
                  the response of his heart to the words she had uttered. He muttered a few words of
                  thanks, uncertain what he said, and only impatient to escape from the scene that
                  he might have time to reflect upon the course he must pursue in this new and most
                  embarrassing crisis of his fortunes.
               The party soon afterward broke up, and Rudolph retired to the room prepared for
                  him, in a whirl of contending feelings which kept him awake till nearly dawn. He
                  rigidly examined his conduct toward Dora during the whole of their intercourse,
                  and he could not bring himself in as guilty of a single action which could bear
                  any other interpretation than that of brotherly regard.
               Miss Calvert was lovely and captivating, but another, with her baleful charms, was
                  before her; every pulse of his heart beat only for Alina, and he could give her no
                  rival. Though years had rolled away since he last looked on her, not a day, not an
                  hour passed in which he did not recall her young beauty as he had last seen her,
                  and the ideal woman was loved more passionately in her absence than the real one
                  would have been had she been ever near him; for the glamour of love is even more
                  potent at a distance than when beside its object. The imagination then has full
                  sway, without any drawback from the inevitable asperities of daily life.
               Toward morning his perturbed faculties sunk into a broken slumber, from which he
                  was aroused by a warning voice which seemed to ring in his ears: "Give up the
                  false one—she will become the curse of your life. Give her up—give her up."
               He sat up in the bed, with cold drops gathering upon his brow, for he fancied he
                  could still hear the words vibrating upon the air, and he found it difficult to
                  believe that they had not actually been uttered near him.
               "Strange!" he muttered. "Those were the very words of the old Astrologer. My life
                  curse! Oh, God! can this be so? Can such love as I feel for that
                  enchanting girl bring wretchedness to the heart that enshrines it? I will
                     not believe it. Away! away cruel doubts; I will give you no place to
                  lodge in; true and loyal will I be to my chosen one."
               As Rudolph was again sinking to sleep, a wailing sound like the wild music of an
                  Æolian harp rudely swept by the wind, floated through the room, and died away in
                  slow and mournful cadence; then it seemed as if the vibrating string snapped
                  suddenly, and all was still. Thoroughly aroused, he listened for the repetition of
                  the sounds but they were not renewed, and he bitterly thought:
               
               "My good angel has chanted the dirge of hope and happiness over my couch. Foolish
                  fancy! love and honor still live, and I will prove recreant to neither. Away—away,
                  false prophet of evil! Alina is my joy, my life, my all; her or none!"
               Wearied by fatigue and long watching, he at length fell into a heavy sleep, which
                  lasted till the sound of the breakfast bell aroused him. Making a hurried
                  toilette, he was ready to join the party below by the time the meal was served.
                  Dora met him with a blithe good morning, and his heart sank as he thought of what
                  lay before him that day. He felt that he must seek an opportunity of making his
                  true position known to her, but how to do this without offending her delicacy, or
                  wounding her pride, he could not see.
               Rudolph made an effort to be as natural and gay as he had been on the previous
                  evening, but it was difficult for him to play a part, and Dora, with the quick
                  intuition of love, soon felt that something had gone wrong with him. She
                  asked.
               "Did you not sleep well last night? You look tired and unrefreshed this
                  morning."
               He replied with a smile:
               "To speak the truth, my slumbers were singularly interrupted last night, and I
                  marvelled if the Hall contains a haunted room in which you placed me to test the
                  strength of my nerves."
               Dora opened her eyes to their greatest extent, and Col. Calvert said:
               "We are not aristocratic enough to have a ghost room. What did you hear or see in
                  your chamber?"
               "I saw nothing; but I was aroused by a strange wailing sound like a melancholy
                  dirge, that seemed to fill the room with its dying cadence."
               Calvert laughed merrily:
               "Ah, I should have warned you. Dora has placed an Æolian harp in one of the
                  windows of that room. Doubtless it was that which disturbed your slumbers."
               "It is a simple explanation, but I am sorry to inform Miss Calvert that the
                  strings snapped last night. I heard them break."
               Dora became very pale—she faltered:
               "Are you sure? It seems impossible, for the guitar strings I used were quite new,
                  and it is only a few days since I put them up."
               "Some sudden change in the atmosphere must have affected them, for I am positive
                  that I heard them snap."
               She said no more, but became so thoughtful, and remained so colorless, that her
                  father marvelled why such a trifle should discompose her so much. Only Dora's old
                  nurse could have explained the superstition she had herself inculcated. She had
                  said:
               "Put up de music strings, Miss Dora, for him you loves be's in de worl', an' ef
                  you'm gwine to be happy wi' him, dey'll play a sweet lullaby; ef you aint, dey'll
                  snap to onct. It's a nice way to try a young girl's fortin'."
               Dora remembered this, and on the day before Rudolph was expected, she placed the
                  harp in the window of his room, repeating with fond fantasy: 
                     
                        "Let music with its dulcet strain
                        Tell him that our hearts are twain
                        Or let the crash of broken sound
                        Tell him of a mortal wound.
                     
                  
               
               Now these words came back to her, and she felt as if a mortal blow had indeed been
                  dealt upon her heart. She could not shake off the impression this little incident
                  had made upon her, and as soon as she could disengage herself from her young
                  friends, she hurried to the window to see for herself what had happened.
               
               The harp was shattered, and every string, save one, was broken, and fluttering in
                  the morning air. Dora was superstitious, as are all tender hearts where the
                  beloved one is concerned, and she fled to her own apartment to weep a few bitter
                  tears over the unpropitious omen. But soon reason resumed its sway, hope again
                  whispered its glad promises of future happiness, and she bathed her eyes, and
                  rejoined her guests with restored calmness.
               Rudolph glanced at her face, and read there the traces of the recent struggle. His
                  intuition was deep, and he comprehended that Dora had found consolation in renewed
                  hope; alas! that this must be crushed out by him who would have sacrificed so much
                  for her happiness; but his love, his honor, his life were pledged to Alina, and he
                  could not give her a rival.
               Soon after breakfast was over, Col. Calvert invited him to a private interview,
                  and together they proceeded to the summer house. The morning sunshine flooded the
                  little pavilion, giving a melancholy brightness to the faded flowers with which it
                  was decorated, and the young man sadly thought that one human flower would, in all
                  probability, soon droop and wither as they now did, deprived of all that was
                  needful to sustain their life and beauty.
               When they had seated themselves, Col. Calvert said:
               "What are your plans of life, my young friend, when the war is over? I shall be
                  glad to be informed of them, that I may do what I can toward forwarding your
                  future interests. I have long felt as a father toward you, Rudolph, and I have
                  often wished that you were indeed my son."
               The listener flushed deeply, and his heart beat painfully, at this opening. The
                  truth must be spoken now at all hazards. He warmly thanked his old friend for all
                  his past kindness, and gathering firmness as he proceeded, Rudolph went rapidly
                  on:
               "When the struggle for our independence is ended, my services will probably be
                  rewarded by a grant of land, and I shall have my half pay. It is my purpose to
                  make myself a home as soon as possible, in which I shall place one to whom I have
                  long been betrothed. I have not hitherto spoken of this, because the hope that lay
                  deep in my heart was to work out its fulfilment through my own energy and success.
                  Now I see the end before me, and I may speak of the love that has been my great
                  incentive to exertion. I have served my country with the patriot's devotion to her
                  cause, but underlying that was the sweet hope that the distinctions I might win
                  would entitle me to claim the hand of her I love."
               "And that one—who is she?" asked the father, with a tremulous vibration in his
                  voice that went to the heart of the listener; but he calmly proceeded:
               "The first day I ever met with you, Col. Calvert, I came to Havre de Grace as the
                  escort of a young girl, who had been received for several months beneath my
                  father's roof. We loved each other; we exchanged pledges which no man of honor may
                  violate; neither is it my wish to do so, for I still love Alina Derval as the one
                  hope, the one reward of my years of toil."
               While listening to this avowal, Col. Calvert leaned forward and concealed his face
                  with his hand. His own disappointment, his daughter's anguish, arose vividly
                  before him, and his strong soul was shaken to its depths. When Rudolph ceased
                  speaking, he feebly said:
               "I would that this had been sooner made known to me. I—I do not accuse you of
                  deception, Rudolph, but perfect frankness would have saved much misunderstanding.
                  Yet—no, boy—I wrong you; I feel that I do, because a bitter disappointment has
                  come to me through this revelation. I had hoped——but it matters not now what I
                  hoped. I am still your friend, and I
                  will do all in my power to promote your future welfare. Tell me of this young
                  girl. Who is she, and what chances are in your favor? Her friends were English,
                  and they may think even a successful patriot no mate for her."
               That will not alter the result, for she is pledged to accept my hand, when, with
                  it, I can offer her a home worthy of her acceptance. Miss Derval is the niece of
                  Col. Fitzhugh, of the English army, and she has lately accompanied his family to
                  South Carolina, whither his regiment has been ordered."
               "And in the lapse of these years, exposed to the flatteries of so many young
                  officers, do you hope that this young lady will still consider her promise to you
                  as binding? Few women could remain constant to a childish passion, if exposed to
                  such an ordeal."
               Rudolph writhed beneath these words, but his faith in the object of his choice
                  rose superior to such misgivings, and he quickly replied:
               "I measure her faith by my own, and that is indestructible. The hopes of my life
                  are staked on her constancy, and I have the firmest trust in it. Let this
                  suffice."
               A bitter sigh of disappointment struggled from the father's heart, but he
                  repressed it, and presently added:
               "Whither do you go after you rejoin the army? I trust this will be the closing
                  campaign, and the blessed light of peace will once more beam upon this harassed
                  land."
               "I trust so—the Legion is under orders for the South; we shall probably be sent to
                  South Carolina, as that colony sadly needs help at this crisis."
               "And the fortune of war will probably bring you within the sphere of your
                  betrothed. Such is doubtless the hope with which you go?"
               Rudolph ingenuously replied:
               "I confess that the dearest wish of my heart is to see my betrothed again. Our
                  next meeting must be decisive of our fate; if she is true, I shall claim her at
                  all risks; if she is false, my life is desolate. Yet no—that thought is unworthy
                  of my manhood; I should suffer all the agonies of a lost soul, but I should
                  survive them, for my mother has given me faith in God and his eternal
                  justice."
               The veteran grasped his hand.
               "Nobly spoken: bravely felt; oh lad, every word you utter only deepens my regret
                  for the hope that is lost. Go upon your path, with the blessing of an old soldier,
                  and the assurance that he is your fast friend through life."
               Rudolph warmly thanked him, and overcome with emotion, Calvert waved him away.
                  Slowly and thoughtfully he walked toward the house, and on the piazza encountered
                  Dora. She glanced at his serious face, smiled faintly, and sped like a lapwing
                  toward the summer-house. She paused on the threshold, and looked apprehensively on
                  the bowed head of her father, whose long gray hair floated over his face,
                  concealing its expression from her eager eyes. He was not aware of her presence
                  till she laid her cold hand on his, and faltered:
               "What is it, father? What has so deeply moved you?"
               Calvert drew her gently to his heart, and breathed in broken tones:
               "Oh, my child—my darling, fate wills that you shall be mine alone, that you shall
                  be the sweet consoler of my failing life."
               Dora trembled like a leaf shaken by the wind. She sunk on her knees beside him,
                  and buried her face in his bosom. He felt the convulsive agitation of her frame,
                  and comprehended the violence of the struggle she endured. At length she
                  whispered:
               "I have deceived myself—he does not love me. Yet— yet since he knows he may hope, he may turn his
                  thoughts toward me."
               "Alas! my child, true love is ever involuntary; it cannot be nursed into life,
                  and—and Rudolph has given his heart to another."
               A faint suppressed cry, so full of anguish that it rent the heart of the listener,
                  burst from her lips. She started up, pale with contending emotions.
               "A rival! what—his heart, so noble, so worthy to be won, gone forever
                  from me! and yet, oh! fallen maiden pride, he knows that I love him! He has
                  spurned the offer of my hand—the devotion of my life, speak—crush me by telling me
                  that it is so."
               "My daughter, be calm—seek not to inflict self-torture thus. I guarded you from
                  such a chance. I only drew Rudolph out with reference to his future plans, and
                  with them, came the secret of his betrothal. For years he has loved a young girl,
                  who, for a short time, was the inmate of his father's family; he will wed her, or
                  none. Of course, after that avowal, our wishes, our hopes, were held within my own
                  heart."
               "Of course," she bitterly repeated, "and Rudolph spoke openly at last, because he
                  plainly saw whither they tended. Oh, I comprehend this very well, yet 'tis not
                  humiliation I feel so much as despair. Never will I love again! No other man shall
                  call me by the sacred name of wife. To you I here dedicate myself, and should I
                  survive you, the remnant of my days shall be devoted to the service of
                  Heaven."
               Her father took her in his arms, and tried to soothe and comfort her: to speak of
                  hope for the future, but she drearily listened to his words, for they conveyed
                  little meaning to her stunned and bewildered mind.
               The sudden shock of finding that she was not only unloved, but that another image
                  filled the heart she had fancied cied already more than half her own, was more
                  than she could sustain. Her head drooped lower and lower upon his breast, until
                  she lay white and lifeless in his arms. Helpless to aid her in this condition, and
                  deeply alarmed, Colonel Calvert cried out for assistance. Rudolph, who still
                  lingered on the piazza, heard the distressed summons, and ran rapidly toward the
                  summer-house. He raised the inanimate form of Dora in his arms, rushed toward the
                  house, and passing rapidly through guests and servants, who crowded toward him to
                  ascertain what had happened, he placed the insensible girl upon a sofa in the
                  hall.
               The nurse, a venerable negress, brought camphor and sal volatile, her young
                  friends bathed her face, and chafed her hands, and after a few moments, Dora
                  unclosed her eyes, and looked with bewildered surprise upon the anxious faces
                  around her. Rudolph had withdrawn from the group, and placed himself where she
                  could not see him. She half rose, and asked:
               "What has happened to me? Why do you all look so frightened, and where is my
                  father?"
               "I am here," said Colonel Calvert, coming forward. "You have only had one of your
                  old fainting spells, my child, that is all."
               "Yet she never had 'em widout suffin had gone mighty wrong wid her," muttered the
                  nurse. "What's come to my baby now, I wonder."
               "Your baby, mammy," said Dora, with a laugh that sounded wild and
                  strange, "I am no longer a baby, but a woman who can suffer and be strong.
                  There—there, I am well now, let me get up and walk out in the air; I am stifling
                  here; my heart seems to have a cord of iron around it, but it will soon beat free
                  and strong again. Aye—free—free, for it will break," she muttered, as
                  she attempted to rise. Her eyes fell on
                  Rudolph: she shivered, grew more deadly pale than before, and feebly said:
               "Help me to my room. I—I am weaker than I thought."
               Aided by two of her young friends, she arose, and after a moment of indecision,
                  approached Rudolph, and steadily said:
               "In a few short hours you must leave us, Captain Rudolph. I will see you before
                  you go, for I have something I wish to say to you before we part, perhaps
                  forever."
               He bowed, and said:
               "I shall be ready to obey your commands," and she passed on to her own
                  apartment.
               Betty Mansel whispered to Lizzie Lawrence:
               "Incredible as it seems, I believe the rebel captain has refused the offer of Dora
                  Calvert's hand."
               "Hush—h—I thought you believed he would be only too glad to accept of it. Dora is
                  subject to such attacks. I have seen her in them before."
               "But they are always brought on by violent emotion. You heard what the old nurse
                  said—depend upon it there has been an explanation, and Dora's hopes are dashed to
                  the earth."
               "Nonsense, we are her friends, and have no right to speak of her in this way, at
                  any rate," and Lizzie turned abruptly away to seek Dora in her own room, and
                  proffer her services as nurse. But the sick heart only asked for solitude, and she
                  entreated so earnestly to be left alone, that her guests soon left her to the
                  quiet she desired.
               Quiet! could that wild, untamed heart ever find it again? Could that restless
                  surging soul find calmness, before the last great change came to still its
                  agonised throes—its rebellious anguish? This was Dora's first great sorrow—the
                  first crushing disappointment of her life, and it bore down all before it; even
                  reason for a time partially succumbed beneath it.
               She was now in the fever fit of despair, and she was ready to dare all to save her
                  bark of hope from perishing in the breakers that threatened it. Why should she
                  hesitate? she wildly asked herself. Rudolph already knew all she could reveal,
                  then why should maiden pride stand in her way? No—it should not. She was a human
                  creature struggling for the life of her life, the love that had become its one
                  hope; then why permit another, who could never love him as she did, to stand
                  between herself and happiness?
               Poor girl! let her not be too harshly judged, for hers was a pure and noble
                  nature, overwrought in this crisis of her fate, and frenzied by this most
                  unlooked-for disappointment. The spoiled darling of her father, she could not
                  comprehend that she could not bend Rudolph to her will, as she had hitherto
                  influenced all who had approached her.
               The door of her room was no sooner closed on her friends than she arose, locked
                  it, and paced up and down the floor with clenched hands, that at intervals were
                  tossed wildly above her head, and eyes in which the storm of passion that swayed
                  her soul was mirrored with startling vividness. The tornado swept ruthlessly over
                  her, levelling all the barriers that pride and culture had sedulously erected to
                  guard her in such an hour as this. She was reckless, desperate; she would speak or
                  die. Let Rudolph go upon his way if he could desert her, but he should at least
                  bear with him the sting of her broken hopes and desolate future.
               Oh, bitter fate! that she, the pride and hope of an old man's heart, the cherished
                  daughter of a haughty race, should have given all the wealth of her soul to one
                  who valued it not! who loved another! He had said it himself, yet Dora madly clung
                  to the frantic hope that filled her bosom.
               
               From her childhood, Dora had been subject to sudden and inexplicable attacks of
                  illness, ending in violent fever. The last was now upon her, and her cheeks
                  flushed to a crimson hue, her eyes burned with lurid fire, and her whole bearing
                  indicated the temporary madness that seethed in her veins. Her father came to her
                  door, and begged for admittance. She paused in her rapid walk, steadied her voice,
                  and answered:
               "Not yet—not yet. I can see no one now; not even you. Come to me in half an hour,
                  and then——"
               The words died away in a husky murmur, and after lingering a few moments, Col.
                  Calvert sat down in the corridor, and held his watch in his hand till the time
                  expired, listening with silent dread to the steps that paced within that chamber,
                  every footfall seeming to strike upon his heart. He alone comprehended that fitful
                  and impressible nature, and he trembled for the result of such suffering to one of
                  her vivid temperament.
               At the end of the half hour, he tapped again upon the door, and Dora instantly
                  unclosed it. In the interim, she had gained the outward mastery of her emotion,
                  and she stood before him apparently calm, though the hand she placed in his was
                  burning with fever. He looked apprehensively upon her, and said:
               "You have one of your old attacks, I must summon Dr. Sinclair without delay."
               "There is no need of him in this case; the fever is in my heart, father, and
                  medicine can never lull it to rest. I shall be better soon; have no fears for me.
                  I admitted you to say that I must see him before he goes. I will go
                  into the library, and await him there. Send him to me, and let no one interrupt
                  our interview. See—I am calm now—quite calm; you can trust me to bid adieu to my
                  old friend, can you not?"
               He regarded her searchingly, and after a painful pause, said:
               "I can trust you both, my child; for you are the unsullied daughter
                  of a long line of true women and noble men, and Rudolph is the soul of honor. Your
                  pride of nature will not bow itself before a burst of passionate woe in the
                  presence of one who is bound to another. Maintain your dignity as becomes you, and
                  bid a final adieu to him who only seeks name and fame to lay them at the feet of
                  his betrothed."
               Dora choked back the hysterical sob that arose in her throat, and asked:
               "Who is my rival? If you named her, I have forgotten."
               "She is the daughter of Col. Derval, who was killed by a fall from his horse
                  several years ago."
               "What! Alina Derval! heartless, soulless—devoted to admiration; is
                     she the one I have to contend against. Oh, this is too wretched a
                  revelation, for she will render him miserable!"
               "What can you know of her, and how have you learned this?"
               "Betty Mansel has a cousin in the royal army, and his letters to her are filled
                  with this young girl. He is one of her many adorers, for she smiles on all alike.
                  Go now, father; I am quite calm. If Miss Derval is Rudolph's betrothed, she will
                  never become his wife; of that, I am quite sure."
               She closed the door abruptly upon him as she added, "In ten minutes, I shall be in
                  the library. Captain Rudolph will find me there; let him not keep me waiting on
                  him."
               Col. Calvert slowly retired, and Dora put up her dishevelled tresses, arranged her
                  dress, and prepared for the interview on which she believed so much depended.
                  No—she would not give him up to such a
                  woman as Alina Derval: that was her final thought as she swept toward the scene of
                  the approaching meeting.
               The library was an old-fashioned room, pannelled with carved oak, and dimly
                  lighted by windows with deep recesses in front of them. A large chair was drawn
                  near one of these, and after arranging the heavy curtain in such a way as to throw
                  her own face in shadow, Dora sat down with a tumultuously throbbing heart to await
                  the appearance of Rudolph.
               She heard his approaching steps, and thought they lingered unwillingly. A cold
                  dread seized her. After all she might abase herself before him, and find only
                  indifference as her reward. Her brain whirled; with difficulty she stifled the
                  cries that rang in her tortured soul; and when Rudolph entered, with great effort
                  she prevented herself from sinking off into another attack of insensibility.
               Dora pointed to a chair she had placed near her own, and listened, without
                  comprehending their sense, to the words of sympathy and regret for her sudden
                  illness which Rudolph uttered. Wound up to the highest pitch of excitement, she
                  suddenly placed her hot hand in his, and said:
               "Must you go? Will nothing detain you beside me. Oh, Mr. Rudolph, can
                  you hope to gain better or truer friends than those who have known and valued you
                  from your youth? Speak, for you hold my life in your hands."
               "And you hold my honor in yours. Dora—Miss Calvert, I am your brother—your best
                  friend, next to your father. Suffer me to retain that precious distinction, and do
                  not—do not force me to say that which can only wound you."
               "I know what you would say," she drearily responded. "That you love another, and
                  I—I am nothing to you. But she is false; you will find her so, and then you will
                  turn to me to console you. Shall it not be so?"
               Her voice sounded like that of a child pleading for something thing on which it
                  has set its heart, but her face, her eyes were full of woman's passion, woman's
                  despair. Rudolph raised her hand tenderly to his lips, and hot tears fell over it
                  as he replied:
               "You are ill and feverish, Dora, and you do not rightly comprehend the drift of
                  your words. I shall forget them, as you will, when your health is restored.
                  There—dear girl, lean back your weary head, and try and regain your usual
                  tranquillity."
               She rapidly said:
               "You evade me. You cling to this baleful woman, who will yet bring woe to your
                  heart. I love you—you know that I do so; but she only cares for her own
                  pleasure—for the glare and glitter of life. She is unworthy of you, and you will
                  find it out when it is too late—too late!"
               The last words were wailed forth with a passionate intonation that struck to his
                  heart, and he shudderingly recalled the weird prophecy that linked Alina's fate
                  with his own for evil. He arose precipitately, wrung the hand that still lay
                  almost lifeless in his own, and hoarsely said:
               "My fate is fixed. I too love you, Dora, tenderly and reverently, but not as my
                  future wife. The best and truest of friends I must ever be to you, but nothing
                  more. Oh loving heart! noble nature! my soul had been willingly thralled by you,
                  had it not met its mate before I ever saw you. Now it is too late."
               Dora grasped his hand as if in a death-clutch, and gasped:
               "You will yet turn to me in your desolation. In the darkest hour of your life,
                  remember that I will be your good angel—that I will breathe
                  consolation when she has inflicted anguish too deep for words to
                  fathom. Go, go—I am faint, I believe I am dying."
               Rudolph knelt before her—he uttered all that the most tender and generous feeling could have dictated
                  under such trying circumstances, but Dora lost all power to listen; she sunk away
                  in a death-like swoon, and pressing one kiss upon her cold brow, he hurried in
                  search of assistance.
               Dora's nurse was watching in the hall, for she was aware of the interview that was
                  passing, and felt the deepest apprehensions as to its result to her darling. When
                  the old woman saw the condition of her mistress, she said to Rudolph:
               "Help me to take my broken lily to her own room, cap'pin, dat dese strange gals
                  shan't find out dat she's tuck another spell."
               Rudolph raised Dora in his strong arms, and carried her like a child to her couch
                  in her own apartment. The old woman busied herself in efforts to restore animation
                  to her, and finding that he lingered to see the result, she turned her gleaming
                  eyes upon him, and said:
               "You'd better git out'n her sight afore she comes roun' agin. I don' need to be
                  told dat you's de cause o' all dis, an' I tell it'll all come home to
                  you yit. Tell massa to sen' for Dr. Sinkler right away, for de light o' his heart
                  is in danger."
               "I would save her life at the sacrifice of my own, if that alone were needed," he
                  hoarsely replied, as he went in search of Colonel Calvert. The woman shook her
                  finger after him, and muttered:
               "'Taint that she wants, poor thing! 'Tis your living love that'll set her up agin,
                  an' likely you's gone an' giv' it to somebody as won't vally it half as much as
                  she does. But de will o' de Lord mus' be done."
               When Dora recovered consciousness it was evident that her mind wandered. The
                  physician came, and pronounced her in a violent fever; this he proceeded to
                  conquer by copious bleeding, and the other severe remedies resorted to in that
                  day, and she was soon reduced to a condition of infantile weakness. For days all
                  consciousness of her recent struggles was blotted from her mind, and she raved in
                  delirious frenzy, or lay white and still under the influence of powerful
                  narcotics.
               Slowly life regained its power in her exhausted frame, and with it came
                  resignation to the fate she had so bitterly rebelled against. Rudolph remained at
                  the Hall till after the crisis of her illness was past, but he saw her no more.
                  Till her own words, wrung from her in the anguish of her soul, were realized,
                  Rudolph was not again to look upon the living face of Dora Calvert. She parted
                  from him a passionate and impulsive girl; she arose from her sick bed a chastened
                  and gentle woman; but so cold, so reticent in manner, that no other lover found
                  encouragement to utter the passion with which her charms inspired more than one.
                  To be her father's comfort and companion seemed now to be the only mission of her
                  life, and to him she devoted herself with all the ardor of her natural
                  temperament.
               Col. Calvert's health still rendered him unfit for active service, and he remained
                  upon his paternal acres, husbanding his slender resources, and endeavoring to make
                  them suffice toward maintaining such internal comfort and outward state as had
                  been the custom of his family. Through Dora's skillful management much was
                  effected, and her father saw her mature day by day into a thoughtful, intelligent
                  and high-hearted woman.
               In religion, Dora sought and found consolation for her broken hopes. She was a
                  Catholic, and all that is tender and true in that faith found a response in her
                  heart. It was now her firm purpose to devote her life to its ascetic rules when
                  the only tie that bound her to earth should, in the course of nature, be
                  dissolved; and she quietly but solemnly prepared herself for the change in her
                  future life, when her beloved father should be removed from her.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               HELEN'S CONCEALMENT.
               RUDOLPH returned to active service in the Legion, in which he was conspicuous for
                  his daring bravery, as well as for other qualities which secured him the
                  confidence of his colonel, and the respect of his comrades in arms. In the attack
                  on Paulus Hook, he led the forlorn hope, and in that desperate surprise and
                  assault the gallant young soldier justified the confidence of his commander.
               This post was held by a strong body of British and Hessians, and it lay in full
                  view from the English garrison at New York, yet it fell into the hands of the
                  patriots, and was considered one of the most brilliant achievements of the war.
                  For this success, Col. Lee received a gold medal and the thanks of Congress. The
                  reward of his young coadjutor was the enthusiastic commendations of those he led
                  on to victory.
               The Legion was then transferred to the Middle States, where their services were
                  highly appreciated. After the defeat of Gates in South Carolina, the army of the
                  South was re-organized under Gen. Greene, and Lee, with his body of tried
                  veterans, was dispatched to form a junction with Marion. In the many brilliant
                  services they performed, Rudolph was always conspicuous over all the junior
                  officers of the Legion, and young as he was, he was promoted to the rank of major
                  by brevet. In the battle of Guilford his bravery was especially noted; in that of
                  Eutaw, Cowpens, and in the attacks upon the fortified posts held by the British,
                  he displayed the most daring gallantry. Through his valor and dexterity, Fort
                  Golphin, filled with stores of every description, fell into the hands of the
                  Americans.
               During this time Rudolph found means to communicate with Alina, and to his great
                  joy he received a few lines from her in reply, referring to the past, and
                  intimating a hope that they might meet again when the dove of peace had folded her
                  wings over the land. Alina was then at Savannah, with her uncle's family, but
                  Colonel Fitzhugh himself was in command at Fort Watson.
               This was the next point to be attacked, and when Alina's letter reached her lover,
                  Lee and Marion were jointly preparing to storm it. This stronghold was built upon
                  an immense Indian mound, which overlooked the clear waters of Scott's Lake. The
                  situation was picturesque and beautiful, and its defenders believed themselves
                  impregnable against every attempt of the patriots, although they had no mounted
                  artillery with which to defend themselves.
               A consultation took place between the commanders of the Southern forces, and they
                  naturally agreed that some plan must be fallen on to give their sharpshooters a
                  fair chance against the English musqueteers. The readiness of invention, so
                  characteristic of Americans, was here signally shown. Large quantities of pine
                  trees were cut down some distance above, and in the silence of the night were
                  drifted within point blank shot of the fort. These were rapidly and silently
                  formed into square pens, which were soon run up to such a height as to overlook
                  the defences of the enemy. In each one of them a squad of men was placed, whose
                  deadly power with the rifle was well known to the besieged.
               With the dawn of day the English discovered the device which their adversaries had
                  used against them, and with sinking hearts they saw that from behind their log
                  ramparts their assailants could pour into their midst a continuous shower of
                  bullets.
               At this point Rudolph commanded, and his object was to prevent the defenders of
                  the fort from sallying out to obtain
                  water from their only well, which lay outside of the walls, or to take any portion
                  of the stores that were in a military store-house, which was also beyond the
                  intrenchments. The attempts of the English to accomplish either were baffled by
                  the practised sharpshooters, who picked off every man who ventured to show himself
                  beyond the ramparts.
               Several desperate attempts were made by the besieged to relieve themselves from
                  their audacious neighbors, but their balls buried themselves in the soft pine of
                  their impregnable breast-work without serious injury to the assailants; while a
                  deadly fire was poured on those who ventured to show their heads above the parapet
                  of the fort.
               But the defenders were true to their blood, and only after a gallant resistance
                  did they yield possession of the fort and surrender themselves prisoners of war.
                  The commander, Col. Fitzhugh, was severely wounded, and as surgical assistance
                  could not be obtained nearer than Georgetown, he was sent thither, with the other
                  officers, who had surrendered as prisoners. Rudolph, at his own request, commanded
                  the party that took charge of the wounded man, and his blood thrilled with rapture
                  at the thought of again meeting Alina, yet his heart smote him as he looked on her
                  gallant uncle, and saw the price at which this happiness must be purchased. He saw
                  that in the face of the prisoner which told him that his days were numbered, and
                  in such a crisis his family must be summoned to his side. The wound of Col.
                  Fitzhugh had orignally been severe, and the enforced neglect of several days
                  aggravated it to that degree that when the party arrived in Georgetown there was
                  little hope that medical aid could save him.
               Rudolph succeeded in finding a lodging for him in the house of a widow with whom
                  he had a slight acquaintance, and a surgeon was speedily summoned to his
                  bedside.
               "It is too late now to do me any good," said the wounded man. "A few days earlier,
                  perhaps your skill might have been rewarded with success; but now, I feel that
                  death must soon come."
               After making a thorough examination of his condition, the surgeon sorrowfully
                  acquiesced in this decision, and recommended him to make such arrangements as were
                  necessary to the settlement of his worldly affairs.
               "Such is my purpose," was the calm reply. "I have not so often met death face to
                  face, to shrink from it now, but I could wish to see those I love before I go.
                  Will it be possible to have my family brought hither, that I may bid them
                  farewell? They are in Savannah, and could easily be with me before the end
                  comes."
               "For that, you must apply to Major Rudolph. He will, no doubt, do all that lies in
                  his power, for he is as humane as he is brave."
               "Rudolph? is he the officer in command? Then I am sure that my request will be
                  granted. Let me see him as soon as possible."
               "He is waiting in the next room to hear my report; and I assure you he will do all
                  that lies in his power to soothe the last hours of a brave man. I will inform him
                  of your wish to see him."
               "Do so without delay, for no time is now to be lost."
               In a few moments Rudolph entered the room, and drew near the bed of the wounded
                  man, Col. Fitzhugh put out his feeble hand, and said:
               "Your name is a guarantee to me that the wish which lies nearest to my heart shall
                  be granted, if it is possible to do so. Nor will this be the first obligation for
                  which I have been indebted to your family. My niece was once a guest beneath your
                  father's roof, and in her name, as well as my own, I ask the last service which a
                  gallant man can perform for his dying enemy. My days are numbered, and I must see
                  my wife and daughter before I die."
               
               "A request made to me in the name of Alina Derval would be sacred to me, even if
                  humanity did not equally command me to grant it. A flag of truce shall be sent to
                  Savannah, with a sufficient escort to bring your family hither in safety. I will
                  at once give orders for their speedy departure."
               Col. Fitzhugh thanked him gratefully, and Rudolph left his room in a tumult of
                  feeling, which prompted him to hasten the meeting with the idol of his soul, by
                  heading the party which would conduct her to her uncle's deathbed. But reflection
                  convinced him that the duties of his position forbade this indulgence of his
                  private wishes, and with many regrets, he saw a party of stout men at arms depart
                  on this errand, their commander bearing a written request from the hand of Col.
                  Fitzhugh, that his countrymen would permit them to pass on their errand of mercy,
                  should they chance to encounter any on the way.
               Several days must elapse before they could possibly return, and in the interim
                  Rudolph devoted every hour he could spare to the service of Alina's uncle. All
                  that the most tender nurse could do to alleviate his sufferings, and keep alive
                  the feeble flame of expiring life till those he so yearned to behold once more
                  could arrive, was done by him.
               In his intervals of ease the Colonel conversed with the young partisan, and
                  gradually Rudolph was drawn into the confession of his long-cherished attachment
                  for his niece. The Colonel listened in evident surprise, and with some excitement
                  asked:
               "And has Alina encouraged you, through all these years, to hope that you might
                  ultimately win her? Was there a pledge to that effect between you?"
               "The most sacred one, short of the ceremony of marriage. We vowed to be true to
                  each other through every chance, every change. I have kept my vow, and I believe
                  her to be true to hers."
               Fitzhugh groaned and covered his face with his shaking hands. A conflict of
                  feeling seemed to be going on in his breast, and the silence became almost
                  oppressive before he again spoke.
               "My niece will soon be here, Major Rudolph, and from her own lips must come the
                  decision on this affair. I have had other views for her, but recent events have
                  dissipated them, and now, perhaps the best thing I can do for her will be to give
                  her to a good and true man, even if he is in arms against his king. Death teaches
                  us strange lessons, and in this hour I see the result of the present struggle more
                  clearly than ever before. The independence of this country is inevitable, and in
                  the land of her birth Alina may be as prosperous as I hoped she would have been in
                  Old England. If such is her wish, I will not refuse to give her a protector in
                  yourself before I die."
               This was more than Rudolph's most sanguine hopes had anticipated, and he expressed
                  his rapture at the prospect that so unexpectedly opened before him, in such
                  fervent language as deeply moved the listener. Colonel Fitzhugh sighed as he
                  recalled Alina's coquettish career, her light and heartless nature, and contrasted
                  it with this soul of fire, this noble and true heart, which had preserved its
                  faith unsullied through so many years of struggle and hardship, that he might lay
                  the fruit of his toils at her feet.
               What would be his reward? Should he not speak? Should he not tell Rudolph of her
                  inconstancy? of her encouragement of another, till he deserted her? for De Vere
                  had recently been summoned to England by the death of his father, and he had left
                  without a word to Alina, to assure her that he would ever return to claim her
                  hand. Honor prompted such a course, but Col. Fitzhugh reflected that his own death would throw the friendless
                  girl upon the world without fortune, without a home, for the slender resources he
                  would leave behind him would barely suffice to support his wife and daughter in
                  the sphere to which they belonged.
               Alina was capricious, extravagant, and impatient of control, and her uncle felt
                  assured that his widow would not long bear with her after he was removed. She and
                  Helen were almost open foes; and, with a heavy sigh, the sinking man came to the
                  conclusion to grasp at the only means of saving her from future temptation by
                  giving her to her first lover. Once the wife of such a man as Rudolph, he trusted
                  that his gentle, yet firm character; his high qualities, and, above all, his
                  passionate devotion to her, would elicit the better traits of Alina's nature, and
                  finally develop her into a faithful and affectionate wife. How his dying hopes
                  were fulfilled we shall see.
               Rudolph watched for the return of the escort with a feverish impatience he found
                  it impossible to control. Alina, his hope, his dream, was coming to him, would
                  become his own at once, for he never doubted her faith; unclouded as his own honor
                  was his proud trust in the object of his choice. On the evening on which they were
                  expected he impatiently paced to and fro before the house, watching with anxiety
                  for some token of their approach. A distant bugle note was heard which caused his
                  heart to leap in his bosom, and in a few moments a carriage appeared surrounded by
                  a body of armed men.
               Struggling to command himself in that moment of long anticipated happiness, the
                  young officer watched its approach with parted lips, and eyes in which all the
                  emotions of his soul were eloquently mirrored. It drew up in front of the house,
                  and he advanced to assist its occupants to alight. First came a middle-aged woman,
                  handsome and elegant, though now evidently in deep grief; then a young girl whose
                  features were swollen with weeping, who eagerly cried out:
               "Is my father living? oh, is he living yet?"
               The reply of Rudolph reassured her, and she sprang from the step to give place to
                  her cousin, who kept her veil closely drawn over her face, though she returned the
                  strong grasp of her lover's hand with a tender pressure, and whispered:
               "Dear Michael, at last have we met."
               Rudolph was too deeply enraptured for words, but Alina read his eloquent face, and
                  knew that he was as much her slave as ever. This was soothing to her wounded
                  vanity, for the apparent desertion of De Vere had given a blow to her pride which
                  filled her with resentment toward him, and the desire to prove to him she too had
                  only played with feelings which had never touched her heart.
               The ladies passed at once into the sick room, and Rudolph kept watch in the outer
                  apartment to secure their interview from interruption.
               Deeply affecting was the meeting between the dying officer and those that were so
                  dear to him. With difficulty could Helen restrain the outburst of her grief when
                  she saw him lying there so pale and worn, evidently hastening rapidly to the last
                  home appointed to man on earth. Col. Fitzhugh had prepared himself for the
                  interview, and he was more calm than those who were about to lose him forever.
                  Even Alina showed much feeling, as he held her hand clasped together with those of
                  his wife and daughter, though Helen, even in that hour, recoiled from its contact
                  with her own.
               As they increased in years, these two natures, so radically opposed to each other,
                  had become more widely estranged, and Helen believed her cousin to be the very
                  incarnation of falsehood and worldliness. Another cause of bitter feeling had
                  arisen in the strong attachment the young girl had for De Vere. Helen was not in
                  love with him, but the uniform kindness and attention with which he treated her,
                  had won a lasting place in her regard,
                  and she considered the conduct of her cousin towards him as capricious and
                  unwomanly. That he would be happy with her, even if Alina finally became his wife,
                  she strongly doubted; for there was a deep-seated conviction in Helen's mind that
                  she would only accept him for the sake of the station and wealth he could confer
                  upon her.
               News from England suddenly came that Sir Robert De Vere was dead, and the presence
                  of his heir was necessary on his paternal inheritance. Permission for his return
                  was forwarded, which Sir Henry Clinton confirmed, and as a transport was on the
                  eve of sailing, no time was to be lost in embarking.
               Alina had gone on an excursion into the country with a gay party, and an interview
                  with her was impossible before De Vere left. He sought Helen, and what passed
                  between them was known only to herself. She divulged nothing, but left her father
                  and cousin to suppose that the new heir had purposely left without any explanation
                  that could commit himself.
               When this news was communicated to Alina, Helen watched her keenly, and she came
                  to the conclusion that no deeper feeling was touched than pride and vanity. She
                  saw that her cousin plunged with added zest into the excitements of society; that
                  she coquetted more recklessly than before, and in the deep disdain of her honest
                  nature the young girl believed that she had done right in withholding that last
                  important conference with herself. Helen had very vague ideas of right, for that
                  had not formed a part of the training she had received, and she considered it
                  better for the future peace of her valued friend that he should lose his false
                  love, than to find, after marriage, how little qualified she was to bestow
                  domestic happiness.
               Thus in the most important crisis of her life were Alina's long-settled plans
                  baffled by the hostility of a child for whom, in her heart, she felt the deepest
                  contempt and disgust.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE INAUSPICIOUS MARRIAGE.
               REFRESHMENTS for the travelers were brought in, and after they had been partaken
                  of, Colonel Fitzhugh beckoned his niece to his side, and in low tones said:
               "Alina, there is one without who impatiently awaits an interview with you. He has
                  told me all, my child. Consult your own heart, and deal with him honorably and
                  fairly, as such a man deserves."
               She colored deeply, and after a pause replied:
               "I scarcely believed that you would listen to a proposal from such a quarter."
               "Once I would not; but now things are changed with us. Our cause is declining—his
                  is rising. A few more hours, and you will be deprived of my protection. Helen I
                  can leave to the care of my wife, with a bare support for them both. You may share
                  that little with them, but it will be a great change for you. I have denied you
                  nothing, and your spirit is not one to brook dependence and straitened means."
               "Say no more, uncle," she replied. "I have already decided on my future course. I
                  will be no clog upon the resources of your widow. Since you approve, I will bestow
                  my hand on him who has long considered it as pledged to him. You may think this
                  avowal strange after the course I have pursued toward Captain De Vere; but I
                  believe that ambition misled me, and his late conduct has effectually destroyed the little regard I ever felt
                  for him. Be satisfied on that score."
               "Then you really love this young Rudolph. Through all, you have cherished the hope
                  of ultimately being reunited to him?" he eagerly asked.
               A faint, disdainful quiver crossed her lip, and her eyes gleamed with a strange
                  expression as she replied:
               "He believes that I do, and I shall do nothing to disturb his confidence in me.
                  Have no fears for me, uncle. I will marry Major Rudolph; I believe it to be my
                  fate, and who can escape that?"
               There was a bitter recklessness in her tones which struck painfully on the heart
                  of the listener, and he earnestly said:
               "Alina, dear child of my dead sister, do nothing that will compromise your
                  happiness. If you do not love this young officer as I feel assured that he
                  deserves to be loved, you are deeply wronging both him and yourself. You are
                  brilliant and beautiful—you can see others, and make a choice which will secure to
                  you both home and happiness. Look into your own heart, and decide your fate."
               For an instant Alina was touched, but after a few moments' reflection, she
                  said:
               "The die is cast; Rudolph loves me more truly than any other man ever will. I will
                  try and be a good wife to him; he has faith in me, and I hope to deserve it in the
                  future, even if I have used the privilege of flirting with others in his
                  absence."
               "Is that all, Alina? In the deepest recesses of your heart is there
                  nothing which can respond to the solemn adjuration of the man of God when he joins
                  your hand with that of Rudolph in the sacred bond of marriage?"
               His tones were deeply impressive, and she shrank and shivered a moment; but the
                  emotion passed away, and she calmly replied:
               "Nothing."
               "Then I give you to him, in God's name. Go to him—let him plead his own cause, and
                  make known to you my wishes. There—I am exhausted, and must rest."
               While this colloquy was carried on in suppressed tones, Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen
                  sat by a distant window, clasped in each other's arms, endeavoring to sustain and
                  console each other in this most trying hour. A strong bond of attachment existed
                  between them, and this was the one consolation of the dying man. He knew that his
                  widow would be a true mother to his child; but he shrank from leaving his niece as
                  a discord in their future lives, for he knew that Mrs. Fitzhugh bitterly lamented
                  the fruits her own training had borne to one of the immortal souls committed to
                  her charge. Alina had gone so far beyond her preceptress in the application of the
                  precepts instilled into her, that she looked with dread to their future
                  results.
               Col. Fitzhugh trusted that in giving her to a true and honorable man, he secured
                  her future from all risks; and with this hope, he fell into a calm slumber. His
                  wife and daughter drew near his bed, and watched over him, while Alina smoothed
                  her hair, and arranged her dress for the interview with her lover. She was paler
                  than usual, but this was accounted for by the fatigue and emotion she had recently
                  suffered; and when she passed out, and stood before the impatient Rudolph, he was
                  dazzled by the vision of radiant loveliness that smiled on him with lips, and
                  eyes, and uttered such soft words of greeting that, for an instant, he was dumb
                  with rapture; but soon found words to say:
               "Oh! Alina! angel of my life! hope of my heart, you are more beautiful than ever!
                  And, oh! above all, you are true to your plighted troth. In all these years, you
                  have thought of this hour as the crowning hope of your life, even as I have done.
                  Is it not so, my sweet love?"
               
               With unfaltering voice, but with a blush that tinged the transparent fairness of
                  her cheeks with a charming rose tint, she replied:
               "I too have dreamed of this meeting, Michael. I have followed your career with
                  pride, and looked forward to the fulfilment of the dream we have so long
                  cherished. What more can you ask of me? Is not this confession sufficient to
                  assure you of my faith in you, and my fixed resolution to share the honors which
                  have been won for my sake?"
               "Yes—for you I have toiled; for you I have risked everything. The salvation of my
                  country, near as it was to my heart, was but a secondary object. You alone, the
                  guiding star of my life, shone ever before, and in the hour of deadly peril, I
                  have called on your good angel to shield me for your dear sake. Amid the storm of
                  bullets, when men fell around me by scores, I passed scathless, shielded by the
                  invisible armor of love."
               She smiled, and shook her head.
               "This is but a lover's fantasy. You have a great career before you, and Fate
                  watched over her peculiar child. That is a more rational solution. Is it not?"
               "It may be; but leave me my fond belief, for it pleases me best to think I owe my
                  safety to the protecting ægis of your love. Oh, Alina, such devotion as ours,
                  lasting through years of trial and absence, surely merits a rich reward in the
                  future. The hour I have so long dreamed of approaches, in which I can clasp you to
                  my heart as my own true and loyal wife. Has your uncle told you what are his
                  wishes and my own?"
               A cold thrill passed through her heart, but she repressed it, and nervously
                  said:
               "He merely told me that he has withdrawn his objections to our future marriage;
                  but, in his present condition, I can only think of him; I could not grasp at
                  happiness over his dying bed."
               "But my precious love, that is precisely what he wishes for. He would give you a
                  protector before he dies. As your husband, I can aid his widow and child in the
                  desolate position in which they will be left. Everything is arranged for our
                  immediate union. The chaplain of our regiment is in town, and a few moments will
                  suffice to summon him to the bedside of Col. Fitzhugh. Give me your long-plighted
                  hand, at once, Alina, and I shall be the happiest of men!"
               A bitter struggle was passing in the mind of the listener, and she turned her face
                  from his ardent gaze, that, in its sudden pallor, he might not read the
                  emotion—almost of repulsion—that filled her soul at this sudden proposal. Actress
                  as she was, she had hoped for time to overcome the shrinking she felt from taking
                  the last irrevocable step which would bind her to him forever. She tremulously
                  said:
               "This is so sudden—so unexpected, that I scarcely know what reply to make. A few
                  weeks delay can make but little difference, and in that interval you can be our
                  friend, as well as if you claimed me as your wife. Do not urge an immediate
                  marriage, Michael, for—"
               The voice died away in an inarticulate murmur, and he felt that the hand he held
                  had grown icy in his grasp. He tenderly said:
               "You are frightened at my precipitation, but there is no other course left me,
                  Alina. I may be called away at any moment, and if we do not seize this opportunity
                  to link our fates beyond the power of man to separate us, I do not know when I
                  shall be free to claim you. It will give peace to a dying man, to know that one of
                  his beloved ones has a protector. I would not be ungenerous, my own love, but it
                  seems best to me to be married without delay, for I shrink from the thought of
                  your desolate position when your uncle is removed. Speak, love! Shall it not be
                  so?"
               After a long pause, Alina faintly said:
               
               "Since my uncle wishes it, and you think it will be best, I can no longer refuse;
                  but, Michael, if I should not make you happy after all! I am wayward, spirited,
                  and full of fancies. This much I must tell you now, that in the future you may not
                  reproach me if I fail to come up to the standard to which you have elevated
                  me."
               "You are all I wish you to be," was the rapturous response. "Failings we all have,
                  and I pledge myself to bear with yours, as you will bear with mine. The holy bond
                  that will unite us, will teach us the best way to render each other happy. I only
                  ask of you to love me with all your heart, as I love you, and there can be no
                  doubt as to our future. Cast that cold shadow from your angel face, my precious
                  darling, for, in this moment of supreme blessedness to me, it seems to indicate
                  fear and hesitation on your part. I trust that I misinterpret it."
               His voice changed so suddenly—his eyes rested with so piercing an expression upon
                  her, that Alina was alarmed lest he might read the truth. She summoned all her
                  powers of self-control, and the color slowly returned to her checks as she
                  murmured: "Is it not natural that this great and sudden change in my life should
                  inspire me with deep emotion? I acknowledge that both fear and hesitation sway my
                  heart, but they spring not from any dread of placing my fate in your hands. I know
                  you to be the soul of honor, and I also know that I have never been loved as you
                  love me. Since you risk your future with mine, let it be as you and my uncle
                  desire. I will no longer oppose you."
               Let us pass over the joy of the young lover; his ardent thanks for this
                  concession, for they fell coldly on the heart of her to whom they were addressed,
                  though she kept up the show of feeling so perfectly, as completely to deceive
                  him.
               Helen came to the door and said her father wished to speak with Major Rudolph a
                  few moments. As the young officer entered the sick room, Mrs. Fitzhugh and her
                  daughter joined Alina in the other apartment. Helen wondered what had passed in
                  that interview, but she said nothing, and Alina remained silent concerning the
                  momentous crisis in her fate that was approaching. Knowing what they did, her
                  pride shrank from revealing the fact that she was on the brink of marriage with a
                  man whose pretensions she had so long ignored.
               Absorbed in their own grief, the two mourners soon ceased even to think of Alina,
                  and when Rudolph issued from the sick-room, they immediately returned to it. Col.
                  Fitzhugh beckoned his wife to his side, and whispered a few words to her. She
                  listened with much surprise, and asked in the same tone:
               "Is it actually settled? It seems incredible to me."
               "It is, my love; and it removes a great weight from my mind. My niece needs a
                  strong guiding hand, and a tender heart to watch over her. These I have secured
                  for her in this noble young man, and he is desperately attached to her."
               "But she—does she, can she love him, after all that has passed since they last
                  met?"
               "She has been pledged to him for years. She consents to ratify the engagement, and
                  that seems proof enough that Alina has cherished a tender feeling for him, in
                  spite of her encouragement of another."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh was by no means convinced of this, but she said nothing to destroy
                  the confidence of her husband in the attachment which had been so long held in
                  abeyance. Alina had long since emancipated herself from her control, and in her
                  heart she rejoiced that the responsibility of her future career was to be removed
                  from herself. She only asked:
               
               "Shall I tell Helen, that she may be prepared for the event?"
               After a moment's hesitation, Col. Fitzhugh replied:
               "No—it is useless. They are not friends; and sometimes Helen is so brusque with her cousin, that she may say something to
                  annoy her. I have not strength to bear the scene that might ensue. Let them part
                  in peace, if it is possible to do so. Rudolph has promised to see that you and my
                  daughter are safely embarked for England; there you will find friends, and the
                  little property I possess. That, and your pension as an officer's widow, will
                  suffice for a respectable support for you and my daughter, and to the God of the
                  fatherless and the widow I must leave the rest."
               His voice sunk away, and his strength was evidently leaving him so rapidly that
                  his wife, in deep alarm, applied such restoratives as were at hand to revive him.
                  Presently he again unclosed his eyes, and said:
               "Raise me up, and place the pillows so as to sustain me in a sitting position.
                  Rudolph will soon be here with the chaplain, and everything must be in readiness
                  to proceed at once. There is no time to lose, for I feel that my very minutes are
                  numbered, and I would see Alina married before I die."
               With tender care the service was performed, and a few stimulating drops were then
                  administered to give him strength for the approaching scene. The chaplain—a
                  middle-aged, intelligent looking man—presently came in, and after exchanging a few
                  words with Col. Fitzhugh, sat down by his bed. Helen wept at the thought that he
                  had come to offer the last consolations of religion to her beloved father; but
                  when she saw Rudolph and Alina enter together, and place themselves in front of
                  the couch, the certainty of what was about to happen flashed upon her. She became
                  so pale that her mother thought she would faint, and for an instant she was
                  speechless; but suddenly recovering from her emotion, she rushed rapidly toward
                  Alina, and grasping her arm drew her to one side, and whispered:
               "Cousin, you must not—you dare not do this. Come with me one moment;
                  I have something to say to you that is vitally important. Oh, you
                     must hear me."
               Alina extricated her arm, and haughtily said:
               "It is too late. You can have nothing to say to me that can now influence my fate.
                  I shall soon be separated from you and your power to annoy me forever."
               "And is that giving you to him? I promise to do better,
                  cousin; only let me save you from yourself. Oh, listen to me for your own sake;
                  for you do not love this man."
               "He loves me, and that shall suffice. Loosen your hold upon my arm; it hurts me;
                  and know that I would not be saved by you, even from perdition."
               There was such bitterness—such concentrated hatred in the low piercing tones of
                  her voice, that Helen's hands fell nerveless beside her, and she sunk upon a
                  chair, sobbing bitterly. She felt how powerless she was in that moment, and she
                  half resolved to cry out and forbid the marriage which was about to take place.
                  Mrs. Fitzhugh came to her side, and spoke in her ear:
               "Helen, it is the wish nearest your father's heart to give your cousin to one who
                  has long loved her. Any violent agitation will kill him. See how weak he is;
                  control yourself, if you would not shorten the brief time he has yet to live."
               Helen saw that she spoke the truth, and after a brief struggle she said:
               "May God forgive us all; I have done wrong, but it is too late now to repair it.
                  Alina will not listen to me."
               "Alina is more fortunate than I hoped she would be, for she will have a kind and
                  attached husband to care for her. Let
                  that console you for any fancied wrong you may have done her."
               At that instant the voice of the clergyman was heard commencing the solemn words
                  of the marriage ceremony. He was an itinerant Methodist, and used only a portion
                  of the Episcopal service; in a few brief moments Alina Derval was pronounced the
                  wife of Rudolph, for good or for evil the bond was forged, and Helen felt that it
                  was now too late to do what her conscience told her should not so long have
                  remained undone. She did not offer to congratulate the bride, for she felt that
                  congratulations on such a union as this would be mockery. Her heart sunk as she
                  saw the radiant face of the groom, and she felt that through her an irreparable
                  wrong had been done to him. Ah! if she could have looked into the future and
                  beheld all the evil that was to spring from the event of this hour, she would have
                  bowed her head in utter humiliation and despair.
               Col. Fitzhugh wished to partake of the last sacrament with his family, and they
                  kneeled around the bed and joined in the solemn rite, but Alina only bowed her
                  head, and when the sacred bread and wine were offered to her, she touched them to
                  her lips without tasting them. To her it seemed a mere form, but if its observance
                  consoled her uncle, she was willing to pay outward respect to it. She believed in
                  no future, and in no power, save that of her own subtle intellect and strong will.
                  These should work out her fate for good or evil, and by her own strength alone she
                  would walk in the difficult path on which she had just entered.
               Rudolph, with his heart filled to overflowing with its great happiness, bowed his
                  noble head, and prayed devoutly for the soul that was passing away, with no dream
                  that in that solemn hour there was no sympathy between his feelings and those of
                  her who kneeled beside him.
               During the night they watched beside the sinking man, who confided to Rudolph his
                  last wishes with reference to his wife and daughter, and he pledged himself to
                  perform them. When the first rays of the morning sun entered the room, they fell
                  upon the lifeless features of the gallant soldier whose last battle was fought,
                  and Helen was taken from his side almost in a state of insensibility.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh went with her, and Alina wept upon the breast of her newly-wedded
                  husband, who used all his eloquence to soothe and sustain her under the
                  bereavement he felt assured she must feel so keenly. But not alone were Alina's
                  tears given to the dead; she felt thankful for the excuse her grief afforded her
                  to indulge her long-repressed emotions; and the bitter tears she shed were given
                  more to the fatal necessity which had driven her into Rudolph's arms than for the
                  fate of her uncle.
               All her brilliant aspirations had ended in making her the wife of a rebel Major,
                  whose fortune was yet to be won: yet even this was better than dependence upon her
                  uncle's widow, and De Vere at least would know that she had not mourned his
                  desertion. To strike a blow which he, in his turn, should feel, had been the
                  moving impulse of this fatal step, and she stood upon the threshold of wedded life
                  with a heart filled with resentful passion for one man, while her hand was given
                  to another.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE FATAL LETTER.
               THE remains of Col. Fitzhugh were buried with the honors of war, and his widow and
                  daughter made immediate preparations to embark for England. After the lapse of
                     a few days, Helen's passionate grief
                  for the loss of her father, settled into a deep melancholy, and her mother was
                  glad of the prospect of change for her.
               Rudolph obtained a furlough, and under a flag of truce conducted them to Savannah,
                  where an opportunity to leave Georgia on a government transport was soon found. A
                  British officer, suffering from the effects of severe wounds, was returning home
                  for the benefit of his health, and he readily offered his protection to the
                  relatives of his deceased comrade in arms.
               Everything was satisfactorily arranged for their departure, and they hourly
                  awaited the summons to go on board the vessel. Several weeks had elapsed since the
                  death of Col. Fitzhugh, and so soon as Helen could arouse herself from the first
                  stupor of grief, she set herself to watch her cousin that she might ascertain, if
                  possible, if Alina's heart was in the contract she had formed. She felt the
                  deepest remorse for the part she had played, and this feeling was deepened by the
                  kindness of Rudolph to herself and her mother. She saw how radiantly happy he was;
                  how utterly devoted to her cousin, and she had deep misgivings as to what
                  revelations might yet come to mar his blissful confidence in the object of his
                  affections.
               Alina, at times, was depressed, but she played her part with her usual tact, and
                  Helen began to hope that she was seriously attached to her husband. She feared to
                  take any one in her confidence, yet she dreaded to leave without an explanation
                  with her cousin. Letters from England might arrive any day, and Alina learn the
                  deception which had been practised against her; and what would be worse, her
                  actual position toward Sir Lionel De Vere might become known to her husband, thus
                  effectually putting flight to all hopes of future happiness in their union; for
                  Helen felt assured that if Rudolph's confidence in the object of his affections
                  was once destroyed, he would become the most wretched of men.
               As if in answer to her fears, a vessel from England arrived, and in the mail which
                  was brought to Mrs. Fitzhugh was a letter addressed to Miss Alina Derval, in the
                  well known writing of De Vere. The quick eye of Helen at once detected it; she
                  grasped it with trembling hands, and excitedly said:
               "Oh! what shall I do now? What can I do?"
               Her mother regarded her with astonishment; she asked:
               "What is the matter, child, that you should grow so pale over a friendly letter
                  from Sir Lionel De Vere to your cousin? After his inexplicable conduct, it can be
                  nothing more."
               "Oh, I know too well that it is much more. Mother, if Alina would only have
                  listened to me on the night of her marriage, what I had recklessly done, might
                  have been remedied. But she would not—she would not, and now the punishment has
                  come."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh changed color, and sharply asked:
               "What have you done, then? You surely have not come between your cousin and the
                  brilliant settlement in life she might have made? Helen, I trust that
                     you have not been the means of prostrating the hopes I had so long
                  cherished for Alina?"
               "I thought I was not doing very wrong, for I was sure she did not love him. No—if
                  she had, she would never have married as she did."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh sat down breathless with surprise and anger. After a pause to
                  recover herself, she said:
               "Tell me all, that I may judge what is best now to be done."
               "I would have told Alina the night father died, but you saw yourself how roughly
                  she repelled me. Do not blame me too
                  severely, mother, for I thought I was doing right, though I have since doubted it.
                  Captain De Vere left with me a letter for her, which I withheld; he also bade me
                  assure her that so soon as his affairs could be arranged, he would return to take
                  her back to England with him as his bride. I did not do it, for I did not wish him
                  to marry so false a woman as Alina is. He is far too good for her, and I paid her
                  back for all her bad treatment, by letting her believe her lover was false."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in deep perturbation. She sternly asked:
               "What was your motive for this? Do you love De Vere yourself?"
               "No—no—I was not jealous of my cousin. I had no wish to rival her, but I like Sir
                  Lionel too much to permit Alina to deceive him as she has every one else. Oh! it
                  was very wrong, I now know, but I could not see it then."
               Helen's contrition was so genuine, that her mother could not reproach her as she
                  felt she merited. Perhaps at that moment Mrs. Fitzhugh comprehended how inadequate
                  had her teachings been to impress truth or right on either of her pupils, and
                  conscience checked the words she might have spoken in her anger. With a bitter
                  sigh, she said:
               "It is now too late to remedy the wrong you have done. Alina has plighted her
                  faith to a good man, and it will be best to conceal the whole affair from her
                  knowledge. I will keep this letter and return it to Sir Lionel when we reach
                  England, leaving him to infer that your cousin preferred her first lover to
                  himself. That is all that can now be done."
               "Yes," replied Helen, eagerly; "that will be best, and he will soon forget her; he
                  will form other ties, and be far happier than he could ever have been with such a
                  wife as Alina would have made him."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter in her pocket, but at that moment an imperious
                  knock came upon the door, and Alina, looking pale and excited, entered the room.
                  She fastened her glittering eyes upon her aunt, and said:
               "A letter from England has arrived for me. Where is it? Give it to me, for I must
                  see it instantly."
               Helen uttered a faint cry, and Mrs. Fitzhugh arose, and endeavored to speak
                  calmly:
               "Who has told you that a letter for you was brought to me? It is a strange
                  assumption to suppose that I would keep back a communication intended for you,
                  Alina."
               "I do not accuse you of such an intention, Madame, but a letter certainly came for
                  me, and was brought in with yours. You may have overlooked it; examine the mail
                  again, if you please, for I must have what was addressed to me."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh confusedly turned over the letters, uncertain now what course it
                  would be necessary to pursue; a cold dew gathered on her brow, and she drew out
                  her handkerchief to wipe away the mist that arose in her eyes. With it came the
                  letter, which in the excitement of the moment, she forgot was concealed in her
                  pocket. It fell at Alina's feet, and was eagerly snatched up by her. She swept her
                  flashing eyes over the shrinking forms before her, and asked:
               "What does this mean? What conspiracy against me has been carried on by you two?
                  Tell me, for I will know; yet this letter will probably reveal all I
                  wish to learn."
               She was precipitately breaking the seal, when Helen sprang forward, laid a strong
                  grasp upon her arm, and excitedly said:
               "Alina—cousin, by all your hopes of happiness, I conjure you to forbear. Do not—do
                  not read that letter, I entreat you."
               
               Alina imperiously cast off her hand, and with lips that whitened with every word
                  she uttered, she gasped:
               "What does this mean? Oh, Heaven! have I been overreached by you,
                  Helen Fitzhugh? You, whom I have loathed and despised with all the strength of my
                  nature? If it proves so, beware!"
               She sunk on a chair, still tenaciously grasping the letter, though powerless to
                  open it, for a violent tremor had seized her, and her fingers refused to obey the
                  impulse of her will. Helen shrank back from her harsh words, but the emergency
                  nerved her with courage to say:
               "Alina, you are now a wedded wife; you are adored by your husband; your future
                  promises unclouded happiness if you will only perform your part as a true and
                  faithful woman. If you love Major Rudolph, refuse to read a love-letter from
                  another man."
               "How should you know it to be a love-letter? The writer and myself
                  are friends of long standing, and I have the right to see what he has said, even
                  if my hand is given to another. I will read it, or die in the attempt."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh would have spoken, but her words died away upon her lips as she
                  looked upon the pallid face and gleaming eyes of the excited speaker. She saw that
                  remonstrance would now be useless; the die was cast, and for good or for evil,
                  Alina must now learn all. The greatest dread now was that Rudolph might return to
                  the house and ask for admittance before this painful enclaircissement was ended.
                  Helen seemed to have made up her mind that a full explanation was inevitable, for
                  she arose, unlocked her writing desk, and from a concealed drawer in the bottom
                  brought forth another letter and laid it before her cousin. She steadily said:
               "That was left with me by Sir Lionel De Vere the day of his departure. I withheld
                  it, because I believed that you cared little about him. On the night of your
                  marriage I would have revealed all to you, but you refused to hear me. Now it is
                  too late. Burn these letters unread, Alina, if you value the noble heart that has
                  given its all into your keeping, and forget that they were ever written."
               While this revelation proceeded, the face of Alina was a terrible study. Anger,
                  despair, desperation swept over its deadly pallor, and Helen felt with a shudder,
                  that in that moment she would have struck her lifeless body at her feet, had her
                  hand been armed with a deadly weapon. For an instant they looked into each other's
                  eyes, and the younger and feebler spirit quailed before the expression of bitter
                  hostility that flashed from those of the excited woman before her. Alina was the
                  first to speak. She steadied her voice with effort, and said:
               "So-o, you have indeed circumvented me; in the hope, I presume, that
                     you would take my place in his heart, and become Lady De Vere. Ha!
                  ha!—Lady De Vere! But I tell you that I would sooner doom myself to eternal
                  destruction, than suffer you to reap the reward of your treachery. He is mine,
                     mine in body, life and spirit, and mine he shall remain in spite
                  of the tie I have been mad enough to form with another."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh here approached and laid her hand upon her arm. She warningly
                  said:
               "Speak no more in this strain, Alina. You compromise your future, and wrong
                  yourself and another by such wild words. Helen has done wrong, and she deeply
                  repents it. Do not crush her with such bitter reproaches."
               "Wrong, Madame! Do you comprehend that she has torn me from the only man I ever
                  loved, and forced me into the arms of one whose devotion to me is a punishment and
                  a reproach? I gave myself to Rudolph in a moment of pique, that I might strike a
                  blow upon his recreant heart; and he loved me, he loved me, he loved
                     me! That is my consolation, and my despair."
               She arose, swept to and fro wringing her hands, and weeping such tears as leave no
                  peace behind them. As the rush of the tornado bears all to destruction before it,
                  the violent emotions that surged in her undisciplined soul carried with them hope,
                  peace, self-respect. The devotion of Rudolph was beginning slowly to win its way
                  to her heart, but this untoward revelation uprooted every feeling of tenderness
                  toward him, and she loathed the thought that henceforth she was his forever; that
                  death alone could release her from the bonds that bound her to him.
               And this had been the work of the despised and scorned child who had been the
                  shadow on her path from the day that they had first been brought in contact with
                  each other. Alina cast into oblivion all the kindness of her uncle, and listened
                  only to the baleful cry of passion that rang in her soul. Suddenly pausing before
                  Helen, who sat trembling and overwhelmed at the results of her concealment, she
                  spoke, with intense passion:
               "I declare undying enmity toward you; I will forget that we are of the same blood.
                  For this wrong I will pursue you, and strike you in the midst of your happiness.
                  Remember—I swear it, and will surely fulfil my oath."
               Overcome by the whirlwind of anger and defiance that raged within her, Alina
                  suddenly fell upon the floor in a violent convulsion. Her aunt lifted her to her
                  bed, and used every remedy known to her to recover her before Rudolph's return.
                  Alina still grasped the fatal letters, and it was impossible to loosen her hold
                  upon them.
               In deep agitation and alarm Mrs. Fitzhugh watched for returning signs of life, and
                  when her niece again unclosed her eyes, she motioned to Helen to leave the room.
                  This she readily did, for she was completely overwhelmed by the denunciations she
                  had drawn down upon herself from the half maddened woman. On recovering
                  consciousness, Alina's first care was to assure herself that De Vere's letters
                  were safe in her possession. She lay panting and struggling a few moments, and
                  then by an effort raised herself, and pointing to the door, said in a commanding
                  tone:
               "Lock the door, Madame. My husband must not find me ill, or engaged in reading the
                  letters of his rival. Yes, his rival—for I love the man that penned
                  these lines with all the passion I have to give. I have loved him for years, as
                  you well know, though you have treacherously aided to give my hand to another from
                  the base fear that I should be an encumbrance to you."
               "You wrong me, Alina, for until this day I was ignorant of what Helen had
                  done."
               "Then why were you attempting to conceal from me, what Sir Lionel De Vere had
                  written to me?"
               "Because it is now too late to undo what has been done. If you had never learned
                  this, you would have become attached to your husband; you might have been happy
                  with him. I wished to conceal the existence of these letters for your own sake,
                  and for that of him who loves and trusts you."
               Alina sighed bitterly——
               "Yes, Rudolph is good; too good for such as I am. I do not love him—I never shall,
                  now, for a gulf has opened between us which no sympathy—no real union—can ever
                  fill. My life thus far has been a lie, and such it must continue to the end."
               "Do not speak thus, my child; your fate is in your own hands, and can be moulded
                  to your will. Give me those letters—let me destroy them in your presence."
               "No! No! Never while life lasts, shall these evidences of De Vere's love be torn
                  from me! I will cherish them as the
                  last bright sparkle on the wave of my turbid destiny, for I feel that storm and
                  tempest will whirl my bark of life upon the strand a broken wreck. The little
                  within me that was true and gentle, has perished in the hour of bitter trial!
                  Henceforth I am an outraged creature, who will redress her own wrongs as she best
                  may: the means, I leave to Fate, but I shall surely find them."
               "Alina, this is very madness."
               "Yes," she wildly broke in, "I am mad, but there is 'method in my madness,' as you
                  will one day find. You have taught me that conventional forms should
                  not bind women more than men; that God is a myth, and Reason the only deity. Why,
                  then, shall I be trammeled by a mere form of words, uttered by a human being
                  deriving his authority from a source that, to me, is not divine? I will not! I
                  will go upon my path, seek happiness in my own way, and break the fatal bond that
                  binds me to a hateful destiny!"
               Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in appalled silence; the result of her own teachings stood
                  before her in all their repulsive deformity, and she dared not raise her voice to
                  combat them. She could only weep, and brokenly exclaim, "Oh, my child! My poor
                  lost child, regard what I have taught you as the idle dreams of the philosopher,
                  and clasp to your heart the faith your mother gave you. In this hour it is your
                  only safeguard."
               A disdainful smile swept over the pallid face of Alina, and she said:
               "Such an appeal from you, Madame, sounds like mockery. My mother's simple faith
                  lies buried beneath the superstructure you have labored to build above it, and by
                  the lurid light of Reason I choose to be guided, in preference to the faint gleam
                  which falls upon the narrow path of privation that, we are told, leads to
                  happiness hereafter.This life is what I prize, Madame. It is mine to
                  do with as I please—to fill with joy, or madden with despair. The first I choose,
                  and I will find a way to carry out my purpose!"
               "Alina, this is wicked. You are overwrought and wretched now, but you will soon
                  see clearer. Reason will teach you that in the performance of duty alone can we
                  find contentment."
               "And do you think that a creature organized like me, will accept that poor and
                  feeble counterfeit of happiness?" Alina fiercely asked. "Madame, your hand has
                  lighted a volcano, and now you seek to prevent its explosion by such twaddle as
                  you have just uttered. Nature gave me strong passions, firm will, and a vivid
                  desire to play a grand part in the drama of life. The man I loved, could have
                  given me the position I covet; and here I am, chained to a petty officer in a land
                  reduced almost to anarchy; my dream of life broken by a ruthless hand, and I a
                  bond slave to one I do not love. It shall not be! I will be free! Free as the
                  whirlwind that rends all before it."
               She fell back panting and exhausted by her own violence. At that moment a knock
                  sounded on the door, and the voice of Rudolph asked:
               "Can I speak with you a moment, Mrs. Fitzhugh?"
               She cast a rapid glance at Alina, and whispered:
               "I will see him at the door. He must not know that you are here, and thus."
               "Let him come in, if he will," she vaguely answered. "He will soon know that I am
                  no longer his. Such love as he bears me, cannot long be deceived, and I am weary
                  of the part I have been playing."
               "No—I will save you from yourself," was the response, and Mrs. Fitzhugh merely
                  unclosed the door sufficiently to enable Rudolph to communicate what he wished to
                  say.
               
               "My room is in confusion with my packing. Shall I go with you to the parlor?"
               "It is not necessary. I merely came to inform you that in two hours the vessel
                  will be ready to sail. Major Walters is already on board, but you and Helen need
                  not go down till the last moment."
               "Thank you; our trunks are in readiness, and can be taken away at once."
               "Very well; in an hour and a half, I will bring a carriage for you and my little
                  cousin. Do you know where Alina is? I ran to her room a moment, but did not find
                  her there."
               "She was with me a short time since," she evasively replied. "We cannot be long
                  together now, so do not seek to detain her from me, if you find her."
               "She is probably with Helen, so I will not interrupt her," and Rudolph turned
                  away, and again sought the room, which, without his idol's presence, had no charm
                  for him.
               He threw himself in her chair, took up the needle-work she had laid down on going
                  out, and, lover-like, pressed it to his lips. The delicate perfume Alina always
                  used pervaded it, and seemed to him to breathe of her enchanting presence. The
                  fulfilment of his long-cherished dream had, thus far, been to Rudolph a blissful
                  intoxication. No cloud dimmed the radiance of his happiness; the transient
                  depression of Alina's spirits he attributed to the recent loss of her uncle, and
                  he loved her more tenderly for this proof of sensibility.
               The portfolio lay open on a table near him, and he casually glanced at it. An
                  anagram lay upon its leaves, which he idly attempted to unravel, but soon his brow
                  darkened, and his breath came quick and hard, for he saw that it was the name of
                  Lionel De Vere, which was made to read, "One ever loved."
               This portfolio had hitherto been kept securely locked, and Alina usually carried
                  the key about her person. With his nice sense of honor, Rudolph felt that he had
                  no right to examine her private papers, but an impulse of jealousy he could not
                  control, impelled him to turn the leaves precipitately, to see if any other
                  memorial of De Vere was to be found.
               A copy of passionate verses, bearing his initials, next met his gaze, and he read
                  them with flashing eyes and curling lip. Why should his wife keep such things? She
                  could not encourage this man, while bound to himself by every tie of honor! No! He
                  would still believe her pure and true as heaven's light; it was wronging her to
                  doubt her: he would look no further, for it was dishonorable to have gone thus
                  far.
               As he laid his hand on the port-folio to close it, and shut out further
                  temptation, it came in contact with something hard beneath the leaves, which felt
                  like a miniature case. He had given his own miniature to Alina a few days before,
                  set in gold, and the thought that she had placed it there, with memorials of De
                  Vere, was annoying to him. He turned the leaves quickly, and lifted a finely
                  wrought chain he had seen her often wear since her marriage, which she said held a
                  locket which contained the hair of her deceased parents.
               Rudolph examined the dark and bright tresses woven together, and was about to
                  replace it, when his finger touched a spring and the opposite side of the case
                  flew open, revealing the face of the man he still remembered with utter
                  detestation.
               Had a venomous asp sprung forth and struck its deadly fangs in his hand, he could
                  not more rapidly have dropped it. He stood with parted lips, staring eyes, and
                  hair rising upon his head, as the certainty came to him that the chosen of his heart, the wife of his bosom,
                  carried clasped to hers the image of his rival; for rival he now felt assured De
                  Vere had been—still was.
               To one of Rudolph's open and confiding temper perfect trust in the object of his
                  affections was a necessity. Without it, love must die a slow and lingering death,
                  and with anguish that no words may betray, he felt that the first blow had been
                  dealt at the very root of the happiness which he had hoped was to throw its sweet
                  incense over all his future life. Why had Alina married him if she loved another?
                  Why had she so bitterly deceived him? Better far to have given her up even to De
                  Vere, than to claim the fair casket when another had rifled the gem it
                  enshrined.
               This very day she had evidently been looking over these mementoes—dwelling on the
                  features of the absent one, while he lavished on her all the wealth of his soul to
                  meet with this foul return. If Helen's revelation had been terrible to Alina, this
                  was almost a death-blow to Rudolph, and he felt as if reason was reeling beneath
                  the shock of finding that where he implicitly trusted, he had been most bitterly
                  deceived. False as fair, she stood before him at last, divested of the ideal
                  perfections with which he had invested her; a creature to be scorned, yet one who,
                  spite of all, was passionately loved.
               He felt this in every thrilling fibre of his frame; no—he could not
                  give her up. She was his by divine right, and he would win her yet to love him.
                  Assured that she might yet do so, he could forgive all, and clasp her to his heart
                  in renewed confidence and affection.
               Unconscious of the lapse of time, he sat with his head bowed upon his hands till a
                  summons came from the hall, and a servant said:
               "'Tis time to get de carriage, Major Rudolph, for de mate have come up to say de
                  ship will start in half an hour, sar."
               He started, slowly arose, and placed the open miniature upon the page before him,
                  beside which he laid the anagram and verses. Thus Alina would comprehend that the
                  secret was no longer her own, and the way be opened for an explanation. With a
                  dull feeling of oppression he went out to order the carriage, and presently
                  returned with it to find Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen standing ready at the door, with
                  bonnets and wrappings on.
               The elder lady had parted from her former pupil with many counsels for her
                  guidance, which were listened to with a bitter and pre-occupied spirit; but she
                  could draw from Alina no pledge for the future, and she left her with the
                  resolution to see De Vere on her arrival in England, and, if possible, prevent him
                  from seeking the renewal of any intercourse with his former love, even by letter,
                  since it would now only end in wretchedness to all the parties concerned.
               Alina refused to see Helen again, and the remorseful girl wept bitterly over this
                  evidence of her unforgiving spirit. She would have given much now to be able to
                  retrieve her error, and bitterly felt that she had done evil in the hope that good
                  might spring from it. When she parted from Rudolph on the deck of the ship, she
                  begged him to forgive her the wrong she had done him. She looked in his face, and
                  saw there the shadow that had fallen over it, and she intuitively felt that
                  suspicion already darkened his confidence in the object of his idolatry. He sadly
                  replied:
               "You speak in riddles, Helen. I am sorry to part from you and your mother, for you
                  have been with me during the happiest portion of my life, and you will henceforth
                  be associated with my brightest memories."
               At the last moment, Mrs. Fitzhugh whispered:
               "Be patient with Alina. Indulge her fantasies, and she will eventually get over
                  them. You will soon learn why I speak thus: show her that you love her through
                  all, and you will meet your reward."
               
               He bowed his head, and said:
               "Such love as I bear my wife can do all, conquer all. If I did not believe that,
                  in this hour I should despair."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh feared to ask how much he knew, or how he had discovered Alina's
                  secret, and she parted from him in perturbed silence. Rudolph stood upon the
                  shore, and watched the ship as she pursued her slow and sinuous course down the
                  river, dreading the next meeting with Alina, and endeavoring to arrange in his
                  tortured mind some method of action which would assert his marital authority,
                  without farther alienating the heart which he now felt had not only become
                  estranged from him in those long years of absence, but had been given into the
                  keeping of another. Bitter conviction to come after one little month of unalloyed
                  happiness.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE HUSBAND AND WIFE.
               WHEN Alina was at last left alone, she arose, fastened the door of the room, and
                  sat down to peruse the words of De Vere. The first letter was filled with
                  passionate protestations of undying affection, and assurance that he would lose no
                  time in the settlement of his affairs that he might return and claim her hand.
                  Since it was impossible to see her before his departure, he would confide his
                  letter to Helen, who would tell her all that he was unable to write. In a few
                  months he would return, and carry her back in triumph as the future mistress of
                  his ancestral home.
               Alina read this through twice, dwelling with fierce joy upon his words of
                  devotion, and more deeply execrating the being who had been the means of severing
                  her from him.
               The second one informed her of his arrival in England, of the enthusiastic welcome
                  given him by his tenants on his return to his paternal home; of the magnificent
                  inheritance, which he valued as the means of placing her in the position she was
                  born to grace. His baronetcy was one of the oldest in England, with a clear rent
                  roll of twenty thousand pounds, and fair prospects of reviving his claims to a
                  barony which belonged to him as the heir of his mother. As Baroness Wilton he
                  hoped some day to place a coronet upon her brow, and introduce her at court, where
                  she would shine preeminent for her grace and loveliness. A few months would be
                  necessary to arrange all these affairs, and then he would return to claim her
                  plighted hand.
               All this grandeur, which her vain and ambitious soul coveted as the only good in
                  life worth striving for, she had relinquished in a moment of pique! Oh! it was
                  bitter! bitter!
               What could she do? Whither should she turn to disentangle herself from the
                  labyrinth her falsehood had woven? Rudolph, with his noble soul, his adoring love,
                  arose before her, and she shuddered at the unpardonable wrong she had inflicted on
                  him; yet she loathed and recoiled from the tie that bound her to him. Yet, when De
                  Vere learned that she had actually given her hand to her early lover, would he not
                  turn with disgust from the contemplation of all her falsehood?
               If she could only lure him back, a divorce would not be impossible; for when once
                  convinced that all hope of happiness in their ill-omened union was at an end,
                  Rudolph's natural generosity would prompt him to give her back her freedom. Yes—it
                  must—it should be so. These letters must be answered at once, and the reply sent
                  on the ship which had just left. Her course to the mouth of the river would be
                  slow, and a faithful messenger could be found who would place it on board in time to ensure its safe
                  transmission to England.
               Never doubting her power to carry out her plan, Alina precipitately arose and
                  hurried to her room. She looked, with dilating eyes, upon the open miniature with
                  the verses and anagram placed so carefully beside them, and she comprehended who
                  had been there, and the nature of the discovery he had made. Fierce joy, mingled
                  with bitter anger flashed into her pale face, and she muttered:
               "Rudolph has been dishonorable enough to search my private papers; to open this
                  case, that he might find cause of anger and suspicion against me. It is well—I
                  will repay him as he deserves. Now my course is plain."
               With feverish haste, she sat down, and dashed off the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "You will see my aunt and cousin, and they will tell you that I am
                                 married, but they will conceal from you the fatality
                              that led to that event. They will never tell you of the base deception
                              which has been practised to separate me from you.
                           Helen withheld your letter, and told me nothing that passed in that
                              last interview between you. I was left to grow wild over the belief
                              that all those years of apparent devotion had been merely for your own
                              amusement at my expense. You know my pride—my reckless nature, when a
                              wrong is done to me. To avenge myself, I felt capable of any sacrifice
                              which would strike a blow on your heart.
                           We came to the South—my uncle received a mortal wound—was taken
                              prisoner, and when we were summoned to his death-bed, I found the
                              officer in charge of him was my old adorer, Michael Rudolph. He still
                              loved me—I was placed in a wretched position, for I felt sure that my
                              aunt shrank from the thought of having both Helen and myself dependent
                              upon her slender resources for a support. My uncle said as much to me
                              himself; Rudolph offered me his hand, and to give peace to my dying
                              uncle, to give a pang to your heart, if it could yet feel anything in
                              which I was concerned, I consented. Oh! I was mad—mad! and I feel that
                              I scarcely merit your pardon. Yet, if you love me as your letters
                              assure me you do, you will accord it to me. You will pity me, and help
                              me to extricate myself from the slough of wretchedness into which I
                              have so fatally plunged.
                           My aunt would have kept your last letter from me, but I learned,
                              through a servant, that one had arrived, and I demanded it. This led
                              to a revelation of the base treachery which has made me the most
                              wretched and self-condemned of women. I love you alone, and my husband
                              knows it, for he has discovered that I have worn your beloved image
                              next my heart since I gave myself to him. I can never be happy with
                              him—my heart is yours, and a shameful fraud gave him my hand. Rescue
                              me as you love me—for nothing is impossible to a strong will and
                              tenacious purpose.
                           
                              ALINA.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               She did not dare to read over what she had written, but sealed it with feverish
                  haste, and summoned the servant of her late uncle, who had been the intelligent
                  agent of many commissions before this. The man had declined returning to England
                  with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and he was still in the house. She knew him to be faithful,
                  and a few dollars induced him to undertake the task of placing the letter on the
                  ship before she gained the sea. This settled, and her rash words irrevocably gone,
                  Alina sat down to await the return of Rudolph and prepare herself for the scene
                  that must ensue.
               Many hours passed away before he appeared, and when Rudolph at last came in he looked so wan and
                  wretched, that the heart not yet quite deadened to remorse quailed before the
                  evidences of deep mental suffering that met her gaze. Yet she nerved herself to
                  take the initiative, for she understood the advantage of being the first to
                  attack.
               The miniature still lay open upon the table, and when Rudolph entered, she pointed
                  to it, and scarcastically said:
               "So—o, sir, you are not above examining my portfolio in my absence. You have
                  sought and found there what has told you that which I am resolute no longer to
                  conceal. I was deceived into giving you my hand; that deception has just been made
                  known to me, and I have the courage to tell you that it will be best for us to
                  separate forever."
               "Separate! Alina, are you mad? You would not so disgrace yourself—so injure me as
                  seriously to propose such a thing? Accident revealed to me the face of that man,
                  toward whom I swore mortal enmity years ago, and if he should cross my path, let
                  him beware. If he has stolen the heart of my betrothed, he shall not with impunity
                  sully the honor of my wife."
               "Your wife—no—no—if love alone can sanctify the tie of marriage, I am
                  not your true wife. Every pulse of my heart repudiates the tie I have madly
                  formed. I believed De Vere false, but he was true to the promises we had pledged
                  to each other. Give me back my freedom; let me go from you, or see me perish in my
                  bondage, for it is odious to me."
               At these cruel words, the cold dew of agony burst forth upon the brow of the
                  listener, and he regarded her with an expression of passionate anguish and regret,
                  that would have moved any heart which was not steeled against him. Hers was as
                  marble to him now, for she had spoken what had surged in her soul from the hour of
                  their union. His words came forth almost with a sob:
               "Then you abhor me, Alina. All the devotion of my life has been wasted on one as
                  false as fair; yet even after this avowal, so enchanting are you to me, that I
                  cannot give you up. What is this deception of which you speak, and who has been
                  guilty of it? I, at least, had nothing to do with it!"
               "No—I do not accuse you of that. Listen, and you shall hear all. When the end
                  comes, as it must, you shall not say that I have a second time deceived you."
               She pointed to a chair, on which Rudolph sank from inability longer to sustain
                  himself; and in words that scathed his shrinking soul, she poured forth the
                  history of her life from the hour she entered her uncle's house, down to the
                  discovery she had that day made. She spared him nothing—she permitted him to see
                  her in all the deformity of her true nature, that he might shrink from enforcing
                  his claim upon her, for that was now her hope—her strongest desire. Rudolph gazed
                  on her with eyes dilating with horror, and pale, parted lips, from which he vainly
                  attempted to force the words of reproach that arose to them.
               Alina finished her recital, and sat before him stern and immovable as fate itself.
                  No blush had arisen in her cheek, no faltering was heard in the even monotonous
                  tones of her voice. She told it as she might have read a story from a printed
                  page, in which he had no particular interest; and yet she knew that this strong
                  and manly heart was bursting with the weight of agony she thus threw upon it; that
                  his life was laid desolate by her treachery—for had he not loved her as the one
                  hope of his youth and manhood? She cared not—what was his love, his despair to her
                  whose strongest wish was to fly from him forever—to blot out his very existence
                  from her memory, if that were possible.
               After a pause, which became intensely painful even to Alina, Rudolph spoke in low smothered tones, that
                  gained strength as he proceeded:
               "In this hour you have destroyed the brightest illusion that man ever cherished.
                  You stand before me stripped of all the charms with which my imagination bad
                  clothed you; for I now see, that save your fatal beauty, you have nothing that a
                  noble and true man can prize. Yet, Alina, I must save you; I must be true to you,
                  when you are false to yourself. If I listen to your wild prayer for freedom,
                  whither would you go? What would be your fate in the future?"
               She recklessly replied:
               "I care not. Only let me go from you. I uttered this prayer long ago, but you
                  would not listen to it. Now, it comes from my lips with even deeper significance,
                  for I cannot—no I cannot remain forever beside you, when all
                  confidence between us is destroyed. I look calmly at facts as they are, but you
                  would delude yourself with a vain hope Now I shall never love
                  you."
               "Yet the holy man of God pronounced us one, Alina, and the obligations we then
                  assumed we may not lightly set aside. My confidence is terribly shaken, but it is
                  in your power to restore it. You have acted with fatal precipitation, and nothing
                  remains to us now but to bring order out of chaos; to bring back the wandering
                  thoughts and fix them upon the duties that we reciprocally owe each other. Let
                  your old feelings have sway over your heart, for you loved me once, Alina, or you
                  are the most false of women. I will be tender and forbearing toward you; I will be
                  thoughtful for your welfare, and I can promise to forgive all—to seek to forget my
                  wrongs, if you will only perform your part in honor and good faith. If you leave
                  my protection, whither would you go? Where take refuge in this wide and desolate
                  world? The thought that you needed my care would render me wretched; for, oh!
                  Alina, I love you still—I cherish you, as the darling of my crushed and bleeding
                  heart."
               He bowed his head, and hot tears gushed over his trembling hands. She felt her
                  power, and even in that moment exulted in it. Whither, indeed, could she turn, if
                  she persisted in her demand? With him she would be safe until De Vere could
                  receive her letter, and act on it. If she left her husband, and her lover should
                  also cast her off, what would be her fate? It would be best to wait—she must see
                  the future clear before her, and then she would take her part decisively.
               These thoughts passed rapidly through her mind while Rudolph was speaking, and
                  with some show of emotion she replied:
               "I have always felt that I am unworthy of you, and never more deeply than in this
                  moment of trial. I have dared to tell you all, because I could not continue the
                  course of deception I had commenced. Your greatness of soul enables you to forgive
                  the wanderings of my heart—to seek to win me back to love you. I give you the
                  power to do so—I retract my mad prayer; let us try and live together in peace at
                  least—in time, it may be in love."
               These words fell as balm upon the tortured heart of her husband. He took her cold
                  hands in his own, and pressed them to his lips and heart:
               "I have moved you from your harsh resolve to sever yourself from me forever, and
                  all is now possible to me. I will win you back, my beloved; you shall forget this
                  baleful man, and make my life precious to me in the future. I trust you, Alina, in
                  spite of all that is past and gone, for with me love cannot exist without perfect
                  confidence. Show me that you are in earnest in what you have promised, and I shall
                  love you better for the victory you have won over yourself."
               
               Alina raised her eyes, beaming with all their wonted softness, and looked into
                  his, as she faltered:
               "You have conquered. I fear that I shall be a sad trial to you, for I am wayward,
                  and often irritable; but your noble trust shall not be abused. Yes—let us build up
                  the shattered fragments of our broken hopes into a new edifice, in which domestic
                  peace shall dwell, for that, my uncle often said, was the one desideratum in
                  married life. By our joint efforts, we can at least secure it."
               "With the help of God, we will surely do it," he solemnly replied. "Let us never
                  recur to this bitter hour; let it be buried in the deepest oblivion, and in time
                  its memories will cease to humiliate us. My protecting love shall cast its ægis
                  over you till yours springs responsive to it, and you shall find that he to whom
                  you have plighted your faith, is worthy of the sacred trust confided to him."
               Alina was touched by this noble confidence, after the cruel wounds she had
                  inflicted on him, and for a few moments she believed that if De Vere should give
                  her up, she would really make an effort to deserve it; but beneath all still lay
                  the hope, the possibility, that she might yet enjoy the brilliant future she had
                  pictured to herself, as the wife of the wealthy English baronet. Divorce could
                  free her, and if events placed the power in her hands, she would find the means to
                  make Rudolph yet desire it as much as she herself did. With her subtle power of
                  deception, she would do nothing by halves. She offered him De Vere's letters, and
                  said:
               "If you wish it, you may read these before I destroy them."
               He shrank back with a shudder.
               "I would not touch them, nor read a line for worlds."
               Alina lighted a lamp, and held them over the flame till they were burned to ashes,
                  and then took up the miniature. Without one glance upon its dark beauty, she
                  struck the glass that covered it upon the edge of the table, and dipping her
                  handkerchief in a goblet of water that stood near her, wiped the painting from the
                  ivory. Then turning its white surface toward him, she deliberately said:
               "Thus will I efface the image of the original from my heart. See—my hand does not
                  tremble. Set at rest all suspicion—all fear, for I will try and do what is right
                  in the future."
               Thus assured, who would not have believed her? Wounded to the soul, wretched as he
                  was, Rudolph felt hope revive within him, and he clung to the illusion that she
                  was touched at last by his noble self-devotion. Oh, yes—in time she must love him;
                  and he uttered everything that could restore her to a sense of the new duties they
                  had assumed toward each other. Alina listened with apparent docility, and Rudolph
                  hoped that the storm had passed over his frail bark without utterly wrecking it.
                  All the gay streamers, the noble sails which had been set before the breeze, were
                  swept away, but a strong firm hand was still at the helm, and she might yet gain
                  the haven of safety.
               Oh! could he have looked into the crafty heart that still brooded over the
                  possibilities of the future, he would have resigned the struggle in despair, and
                  permitted the frail craft to strike and sink at once.
               It is a trite truth that the noblest and best of men are most easily deceived,
                  especially where feminine tact and guile are brought to bear against them. A few
                  weeks of gentle and submissive melancholy on the part of Alina, completely
                  reassured her husband. By degrees her manner toward him became tender and
                  caressing, and he believed that she was rapidly learning the lesson she had set
                  for herself.
               
               Never was loving confidence more perfectly illustrated than in Rudolph's conduct
                  toward her. He never alluded to that painful interview, and showed such tender
                  consideration for her in everything he did, that any other heart would have been
                  touched by his daily proofs of devotion. She received all as her due, and thought
                  she honored him by consenting still to bear his gallant and untarnished name.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               AN EXPLOSION.
               RUDOLPH returned to his military duties, taking his wife to a small village
                  situated in that portion of the country occupied by the patriot forces. Alina soon
                  became an object of attention to his brother officers; and in the ennui of the
                  interval that must elapse before she could hope to hear from De Vere, she adopted
                  her old style of flirting with every presentable man that approached her. Yet so
                  adroit were her movements, so veiled her coquetries, that he whose hopes were
                  beginning slowly to revive, received the first intimation of them from a
                  conversation he accidentally overheard between two young officers of his own
                  troop.
               "I say, Johnson," said one of them, "that is a spirited creature that our major
                  has married. Ah! she's a whole team; but I wonder what he can be thinking of to
                  give the reins into her hands. It's my opinion that she'll drive him to the deuce
                  before she's done with him."
               "Poor fellow! he's desperately in love with her, and she don't care the snap of a
                  finger for him. She's the most out and out coquette I ever saw. Looks sweet on us
                  all, from the colonel down to the sub-lieutenant; yet when Rudolph is by, she
                  fools him to the top of his bent. I tell you that woman is out of place here.
                  She's a born intriguer, and would make her way to the topmost round if she was in
                  a court among people of her own stamp."
               "It's a burning shame that the major, who is really one of the noblest fellows in
                  the world, should have been taken in by such a woman."
               Twilight had fallen, and Rudolph was walking near the bank of a narrow stream on a
                  pathway that wound above a hollow in which the speakers were seated, leisurely
                  smoking their cigars. Their words rang out on the still atmosphere so distinctly
                  that he could not avoid hearing them, and for an instant he stood as one
                  petrified. Then his impulse was to rush forward, and demand satisfaction for the
                  insulting insinuations against his wife, but the sickening certainty that they
                  spoke the truth, that Alina's name would be compromised by such action on his
                  part, withheld him.
               After all her promises she was still deceiving him. He hurried away from the
                  vicinity of the speakers, and sat down on a knoll to think over all the incidents
                  of the past weeks. To him Alina had been gentle and affectionate, and just as he
                  began to dream of renewed hope in the future, this deadly blow came to crush his
                  castle in the air. He could not become a spy upon his wife. His honorable nature
                  recoiled from the thought, yet must he not save her from becoming the subject of
                  such comments as he had just overheard? Save himself from the contempt and
                  ridicule ever lavished upon a too complying husband? The dreary certainty now came
                  to him that Alina had spoken the truth: she would never love him. The image of
                  Dora Calvert arose before him, and in bitterness of soul, he murmured:
               "Oh, Dora, your words have come true; I but trampled on your devoted love to take
                  to my heart the curse of my life.
                  Yet—oh! weak fool! I still cling to her; I adore her, in spite of all her
                  treachery."
               Since his marriage, Rudolph had constantly been in active service, and he only
                  visited Alina at intervals when his duties permitted him to spend a few days with
                  her. Under these circumstances, it was easy for her to keep up the show of
                  increasing attachment which she had resolved on as the safest game for her to
                  play, till assured of the success of her ulterior plans.
               She watched with intense solicitude for the arrival of letters from England,
                  believing that her fate would be decided by their contents. Alina left Savannah
                  with Rudolph the day after her aunt's departure, and remained in Georgetown with a
                  few other officers' wives, who were willing to endure every hardship to be near
                  their husbands. The days passed wearily enough to her, and the only diversion to
                  her ennui was found in the admiration her rare beauty always elicited.
                  Unrestrained by any innate sense of principle, reckless of everything beyond the
                  amusement of the hour, she soon gave cause for comments even more severe than
                  those her husband had overheard.
               At length Rudolph arose with a heavy sigh, and slowly returned toward his
                  lodgings. As he drew near the house, he heard music and laughter, and approaching
                  one of the windows that opened from a brilliantly lighted room, saw within a gay
                  party of young people, of which his wife was the most prominent figure. A negro
                  was playing an old violin, and they were engaged in the romping country dance
                  known as "Hunt the squirrel." Of this Alina seemed the very life and spirit; she
                  danced exquisitely, and all her coquettish graces were brought in play as she
                  flitted from one end of the room to the other, now evading her partner, then
                  glancing in his face with smiles, as she placed her dainty hand in his, evidently
                  not shrinking away when he pressed it all too ardently in his own.
               Rudolph looked on with sickening heart. Alina yet wore mourning for her uncle, and
                  in such a scene as that, it seemed indeed the "mockery of woe." The dance at last
                  ended, and still attended by her partner, Alina approached the window near which
                  Rudolph stood, concealed by a thick growth of shrubbery near it. He heard the
                  compliments almost bordering on a declaration of love that were whispered to
                  her—and listened to the coquettish replies she made, so heart-struck, that for a
                  few moments he was incapable of moving. Rocovering himself, he moved around to the
                  entrance with firm step, and haughty bearing, entered the room, and walked
                  directly toward Alina. She saw his face, comprehended that something had gone
                  wrong with him, and hastily flitting from the side of her companion, with her
                  winning smile, she gained his side, laid her hand softly upon his arm, and
                  said:
               "Let us go—I am weary of this scene. I but engaged in it to wile away the moments
                  of your absence."
               "Yes," he mechanically replied, "I am ill—let us retire."
               Alina nodded and smiled to those she was leaving, evaded their entreaties to
                  remain, and accompanied Rudolph to their own apartment. He looked so pale and
                  stern, that she was alarmed, and after closing the door, anxiously asked:
               "What has happened? Are you really indisposed?"
               "I am wretched! degraded, hopeless of everything now," he passionately answered.
                  "Oh, Alina, have you no heart in your bosom that can be touched by a true man's
                  devotion? No respect for his honor, that you can make yourself the by-word and the
                  scorn even of those who flatter you to your own undoing? This night I heard others
                  speaking lightly of you, and I came hither to witness myself the confirmation of
                  what they had said. I looked through the window upon you as you danced and coquetted with Captain Woodson. I overheard
                  his words as you stood near the window; words which you should have resented as an
                  insult, but which you listened to with a smile; to which you replied in the same
                  strain."
               A deep flush arose to the cheeks of Alina as she listened to this outburst, and an
                  ominous flash darted from her eyes. Her lips curled disdainfully as she said:
               "You call yourself a man of honor, and as such I hitherto regarded you, but
                  playing the part of a spy upon your wife, is a poor proof of it. My life is stupid
                  to the last degree; I am cut off from everything that is desirable to me, and yet
                  you complain because I seek a few moments' diversion in a petty country dance, and
                  listen to a few compliments from a verdant young gentleman whose knowledge of
                  society has not taught him how far he can, with propriety, express his admiration
                  of a charming woman. If you think that a course of jealous tyranny is to win my
                  affections, you are mistaken. In this hour you have dealt a fatal blow to the love
                  that was beginning to dawn for you. I would have redeemed my pledge; in time, I
                  might have——Yet why do I say what I would have done? when you have
                  recklessly crushed out the first blossom of affection that has bloomed for
                  you."
               Aware that tears were her most efficient weapon, she here covered her face with
                  her hankerchief, and sobbed as if her heart was breaking. Rudolph began to think
                  that he had been too violent; he wished that he could doubt the evidence of his
                  own senses, and restore her to the place in his respect which she had lately
                  occupied, but that, alas! was impossible. He sadly said:
               "I have done all that man can do to nourish that blossom, Alina, and if it
                  possesses any true vitality, a remonstrance which is due to myself, will not
                  destroy it. You are my wife, and you must avoid the breath of scandal. A flirting
                  married woman is not long tolerated in this land of simple habits and stringent
                  morals. A wife must be all to her husband or—nothing."
               "If it comes to that, I will choose the last," she angrily retorted. "Cast me
                  off—give me a pittance on which to sustain life, and you shall never see my face
                  again. I will neither be your slave, nor conform to the rules of a society I
                  disdain. I was not born to play the part of a meek Griselda, and I will not do it.
                  No, even if I loved you, I would not."
               Rudolph sighed wearily.
               "I begin to feel that your words will prove true; that you will never love me.
                  This sad conviction forces itself upon me, but even that does not lessen my
                  responsibility toward you. I am the only protector you can claim, and my promise
                  to your dying uncle must be performed. For good, for evil, our lot in life is cast
                  together, and we must bear the yoke even if it eats into the soul and cankers
                  there. 'Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder,' has been
                  promulgated as Heaven's law, and we must abide by the solemn decree. I
                     demand from you respect for your marriage vow, and such
                  circumspection in your conduct as will save you from censure. This much I have a
                  right to exact, and I shall do so."
               He spoke with such stern sadness, that Alina saw it would be dangerous to trifle
                  with him in his present mood: so she only sobbed more bitterly, but promised
                  nothing. A little while, and she would show him on what a broken reed he had
                  depended when he trusted her. That very morning-a letter had mysteriously reached
                  her, without the knowledge of her husband. It was from De Vere, in answer to hers,
                  for many months had now elapsed since the departure of Mrs. Fitzhugh, and ample
                  time had been afforded for the transmission of his reply.
               
               In it he bitterly reproached her for giving her hand to his rival, and heaped
                  maledictions on the head of poor Helen, whom he had not seen since her arrival in
                  England. He had held one brief interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and left her to find
                  Alina's letter waiting him. To answer it, after the first fury of his anger
                  subsided, was his next impulse; and in that reply he told her that she had been so
                  deeply sinned against that he could not withhold his forgiveness. He would come to
                  her; he would tear her from the arms of Rudolph; but in the interim she must do
                  nothing to arouse her husband's suspicion. With guileful sophistry he said:
               "The rigid followers of our creed do not recognize the validity of a marriage
                  performed by a dissenting minister. Fly with me, and a priest shall unite us at
                  once; the last union will be the true one, and if Rudolph thinks your possession
                  worth disputing, I will take such measures as will prove my better right to you,
                  and set his claims at nought. Oh, Alina! if I thought that this man has really
                  rivalled me in your heart, I should go mad. I will tear you from him, and leave
                  him to banquet on his crushed hopes; to drink his own tears; fit punishment for
                  him who has stepped between me and my adored one. A few more weeks and I can leave
                  for America; hope, my angel, for I will come to your rescue as surely as the sun
                  will rise to-morrow."
               There was much more in the same strain, and Alina carefully concealed this letter
                  from her husband. She read it again and again, and counted the hours that must
                  elapse before the writer could be near her. This had given unwonted lightness to
                  her spirits that evening, and the glad buoyancy with which she had flitted through
                  the dance was but an echo of the happy beating of her heart. Such compunction
                  punction as she might once have felt for the bitter wrong toward the heart that
                  trusted her, was now dead within her, for she almost hated Rudolph as the stern
                  arbiter of her destiny, and despised him for the very love he still cherished for
                  her.
               The capricious irritability of Alina's temper during the next week tasked the
                  forbearance of Rudolph to its utmost limits. She refused to leave her own
                  apartment; since, as she asserted, her most innocent actions were misenterpreted;
                  and such pastimes as she found pleasure in were objectionable to him. She would
                  abjure all society if she was to be criticised and scolded for everything she did,
                  and when she had moped herself into a perfect piece of stupidity and dullness,
                  perhaps he would approve her as a pattern wife.
               She ceased all her wiles; left him to his wretchedness, in the hope that he would
                  cease to love her, and when the final certainty came that she had indeed deserted
                  him, he would not seek to avenge himself on the one who had supplanted him.
               Rudolph had a furlough for but two weeks, and Alina saw the days roll away with
                  the belief that they were the last they would ever spend together; yet she
                  zealously sought to render every hour a bitterness to him. In that time, he was as
                  completely disenchanted as it was possible for a man to become; and he almost
                  recoiled from the thought that to this fair piece of subtlety and deception, he
                  had given the power to darken his whole life. Yet such a passion as he had
                  cherished for her was not torn up by the roots without a struggle that was more
                  dire than death itself; and his pale, set features, the restless fire that burned
                  in his eyes, betrayed the suffering that wrestled in his strong soul. Alina saw
                  it, yet relented not in her purpose.
               "He will hate, he will despise me," she thought; "but even that is better than his
                  love."
               
               On the last evening, they sat together in her room; but as widely estranged as if
                  the circumference of the earth lay between them, for there was no chord of
                  sympathy to touch the electric spark in the bosom of either. Rudolph had
                  relinquished all hope, and in a kind of sullen despair sat down to look upon her
                  fatal beauty, and feel how utterly its power had departed, now he comprehended
                  that it was not the outward symbol of the angelic nature that he had believed it
                  indicated.
               Suddenly there was a commotion in the street; a messenger, riding in hot haste,
                  dismounted in front of the house, and the words, "Naval engagement—Victory!"—met
                  their ears. Rudolph looked out of the window, and spoke to the courier, who was
                  eagerly detailing the news of which he was the bearer. He recognised the man as a
                  sergeant, who had once served in his own troop, and asked:
               "What is it, Judson?"
               "Great news, major, for our side. There has been a fight between some French and
                  English ships; our allies were victorious; but I have a bulletin here, with the
                  account of the affair, and a list of the prisoners taken."
               "Send it up to me a moment. I will bring it down myself as soon as I have looked
                  over it."
               Alina listened in breathless perturbation. De Vere's letter had been delayed, and
                  he might be on one of the captured vessels. The very thought made her heart stand
                  still, and she became so pale that Rudolph asked her if she was ill. She muttered
                  some unintelligible reply, and listened with dilating eyes to the sound of
                  footsteps ascending the stairs, for on the news the messenger brought she almost
                  felt that her very life depended.
               A small, dingy-looking square of paper, printed on one side, was handed in to
                  Rudolph, and he eagerly approached the light to read its contents. Alina softly
                  drew near him, and looked over his shoulder; she scarcely glanced at the details
                  of the important victory that had been won, and her eyes flitted rapidly toward
                  the following paragraph:
               
                  "Among the prisoners taken was a young English baronet who has served in
                     America. Sir Lionel De Vere was sent to France on the ship which took thither
                     the news of the engagement."
               
               The blow was so sudden that Alina could no longer control herself, and she fell
                  back in violent hysteric spasms. Her cries drew the attention of Rudolph to her
                  condition, and he lifted her to the bed, and used such restoratives as were at
                  hand. He too had seen the announcement of De Vere's capture, and he comprehended
                  the cause of her illness with a pang even more bitter than all that had gone
                  before.
               When her shrieks had sunk into long-drawn sobs, and she lay before him white and
                  motionless, he ventured to leave her alone a few moments, and go below to mingle
                  with the crowd which was discussing the event of the hour, and the probable effect
                  it would have in terminating the war. He was warmly greeted, and his opinion
                  eagerly sought; he replied briefly, but courteously, and those who knew him best
                  saw that some personal grief was weighing heavily upon him. A torch-light
                  procession in honor of the victory was hurriedly arranged, and he was solicited to
                  join it; but he excused himself on the score of his wife's illness, and returned
                  to her side.
               In the interval, Alina had composed herself, and regained the power of thought.
                  She had played her part badly of late; she had trusted too little to the chances
                  of war; had too implicitly relied on the arrival of De Vere, and her dupe had been
                  permitted to see too clearly all the hollowness of her nature. Her power over him
                  was gone forever, and what would now be her fate? Rudolph would decide it, and she shrank from the thought that
                  her dependence upon him placed her utterly in his power. She felt assured that he
                  comprehended the cause of her sudden attack, and she nerved herself for the
                  interview that approached, calling up all her natural hardihood and recklessness
                  to sustain her through it.
               Rudolph glanced toward her as he entered, and then paced the floor with restless
                  steps till he could control his voice sufficiently to speak with calmness. At
                  length she burst forth:
               "What have you to say that requires so much reflection? I am prepared to hear you,
                  let it be what it may."
               "I see that you are prepared," he replied, with deep sadness. "It is not very long
                  since I took you to my heart as the most coveted boon of life, and now I pronounce
                  the fiat that separates us, whether it shall be forever depends upon yourself. I
                  will send you to my father's house, to remain under the care of my parents till
                  you summon me to your side."
               "What! immure me in that lonely farm-house, with no associates but boors? I refuse
                  to go—I will not be dealt with thus."
               "It is all I can do for you," he coldly replied. "My mother is a refined and noble
                  woman; my father and brother will treat you with the respect that is due to my
                  wife. My wandering life precludes me from watching over you myself, and it is my
                  unalterable resolution to place you with them."
               Alina wept, entreated, finally raved, but he listened to her with an expression of
                  calm sadness which proved how little he was moved. At length she stopped,
                  exhausted and frightened at the little effect she produced.
               On the silence that ensued, his voice suddenly rang out with a deep cadence that
                  startled her.
               "Alina, I saw what made you ill. That man was coming hither, and in pursuit of
                  you. Speak the truth—was it not so, and have you not heard from him since you
                  became my wife?"
               "By what right do you question me thus? I can receive a letter from an old friend
                  without accounting to you for it, if the law does make you my master."
               "Aye—from a friend, but not from a lover. In that character De Vere has written to
                  you—in that character he was seeking you, and I demand that letter."
               "You may take my life—you may tear the heart from my body—sooner than I will grant
                  your demand. But since you drive me to desperation, I will tell you that he
                     was coming to me—that I would have gone with him, and shared his
                  fate either for good or for evil."
               He looked at her pallid face, her gleaming eyes, and shuddered. She had wrought
                  herself to a pitch of excitement that rendered her utterly reckless of
                  consequences. She rapidly went on:
               "Our marriage was informal: it shall not bind me to misery, for I do not
                  acknowledge its validity."
               "It is too late now to dispute the validity of the tie that binds us to each
                  other. A fatal, fatal presentiment warned me in the first hour of meeting, that De
                  Vere and myself were to come in collision at some future day. I warn you that, if
                  he had carried out his purpose—if he yet seeks to do so—I shall kill him. Yes—the
                  brand of Cain will be placed upon my brow by your hand, and the bitterness of
                  remorse, of baffled wrong, will be yours to bear to your grave. Think of this
                  alternative, and school your rebellious heart to return to the allegiance you owe
                  me as your lawful husband."
               "You would not dare commit such a wrong! It is incredible—it is shameful, thus to
                  threaten a helpless woman."
               
               "I do not threaten you. I only place before you the stern decree of fate itself,
                  if you dare invoke such a punishment upon your head."
               "And I, who might have been Lady De Vere—who might have shone in the sphere I was
                  born to fill, must give up the man I love, the brilliant fortune he can give me,
                  to become the inmate of a farm-house in this dreary land, because you possess the
                  fatal power to rule my destiny. It is your hour now, but mine will surely
                  come—yes—it will surely come."
               She stopped, suffocated by the rage and despair that filled her soul. Rudolph said
                  with emotion:
               "The only hour of peace, of hope, that can ever dawn for you, will be that in
                  which you awake to a true perception of the enormous wickedness you have
                  contemplated; in which you ask pardon of Heaven for your wanderings, and return to
                  the path of honor and fidelity to him to whom you have plighted your faith. I can
                  wait for that hour, in the hope that God has not utterly forsaken you; that His
                  voice will yet be heard in your soul, and show you the right. From my mother's
                  gentle influence, I hope much for you, and to her care I shall consign you till
                  you summon me yourself to your presence."
               Alina recovered voice to say:
               "And is it your irrevocable determination to consign me to this living death? Kill
                  me at once, but do not send me to the Glen, for I shall perish there of slow
                  decay."
               "On the contrary, you will there learn the true uses of life; you will begin to
                  comprehend that it is not given to us to waste in frivolity and self-indulgence.
                  My only hope for you is, that this enforced seclusion will restore you to a sane
                  condition of mind, for I must believe that you are suffering from temporary
                  madness. Weigh well what I have said to you, for I am fearfully in earnest, and
                  what I have declared, I will surely accomplish if the dire necessity arises.
                  To-morrow I must join my regiment; but as there is no immediate prospect of active
                  service, I can procure leave of absence for a few weeks. In ten days I shall
                  return here, and you must be ready to accompany me to the Glen. I will write at
                  once to prepare my mother for your arrival."
               "So—o—you have issued your ukase, and nothing remains for me, poor helpless wretch
                  that I am, but to obey it. Well, with your sex, 'might is always right,' I know,
                  and since I cannot help myself, I must submit to your tyrannical decree. But you
                  will gain nothing by it; I will close my ears and my heart to all the stupid
                  twaddle of your mother, for she shall never make me such an old Joan as she is.
                  There! you need not look so wrathful and so white. I will not listen
                  to her; I will not make an effort to love you and I will yet carry out my plans.
                  Now you know the ground you stand on, so let me alone. I am tired and worn out
                  with all this excitement."
               She turned her face upon the pillow, and pressed it down to shut out his reply,
                  but Rudolph did not attempt to make any. He only looked sorrowfully and
                  compassionately upon her, and turned to the table to write a few lines to his
                  mother, in which he merely stated that his unsettled life rendered it expedient to
                  place his wife under the care of his parents for a brief season; and it was his
                  intention to bring her to the Glen without delay. He said nothing of the bitter
                  sorrow and disappointment which darkened his life. It would be time enough to make
                  this known to his mother when it could no longer be concealed from her. She would
                  suffer enough from this knowledge, let it come when and how it might.
               On the following morning, Rudolph left Georgetown, and no sooner was he gone, than
                  Alina issued from her apartment, and
                  resumed the life she had hitherto led. If this was to be her last glimpse of
                  freedom, she would use it to the utmost, she cared not what gossips might say; and
                  she rode daily with an escort of young officers, went to picnics, and danced every
                  evening with a gay party of young people, who were as thoughtless as herself, and
                  bent only on gleaning amusement from the passing hour.
               The days passed all too quickly away, and at the end of the appointed time,
                  Rudolph arrived, and informed her that his arrangements were made for removing her
                  at once to the Glen. He had been ordered to Yorktown, and from that point it would
                  be easy to cross over into Maryland, and gain his father's house.
               Again Alina remonstrated, and passionately refused to go, but he quietly proceeded
                  to have everything prepared for her departure, and on the morning he had named
                  they set out for Virginia. At the last she did not dare to resist him, though she
                  had every disposition to do so, for she saw that gentle and tender as Rudolph had
                  proved himself to be, there was in him an iron strength of purpose that would not
                  be baffled when he felt himself in the right.
               He treated her with punctilious politeness; showed every care for her comfort in
                  the fatiguing journey they were compelled to make, but he no longer played the
                  part of the lover to her. He made no effort to win upon the affections which, to
                  him, were a sealed fountain, and made her feel in her turn that if a re-union
                  between them was possible, he must be propitiated.
               Alina now bitterly regretted the imprudent avowals she had made to him in a moment
                  of passion. But for this insight into her heart, her influence over him would have
                  been unabated, and she could at least have remained where the stir and bustle of
                  active life would give some variety to her existence. How could she live in that
                  dreary country place, with no excitement, no admiration; for the last had become
                  as the very breath of life to her.
               When she reached Yorktown, she was so much indisposed that a few days repose were
                  necessary before proceeding upon their journey. The celebrated siege which
                  virtually closed the Revolutionary War was commencing, and Alina saw there the
                  great and glorious Father of his Country, surrounded by officers of his staff,
                  when he daily visited the works that were in progress, infusing new energy into
                  those who labored for so great a cause. Her sympathies were not with it, though
                  she was unhappily the wife of an American officer, but even she could not look
                  upon the noble and thoughtful face of the great chieftain without feeling that God
                  had created him for a grand mission which, in time, he would successfully
                  accomplish.
               On the fourth morning after their arrival at Yorktown they resumed their journey,
                  and with an escort of troopers crossed over to a point on Chesapeake Bay from
                  which a sloop was engaged to take them to Havre de Grace.
               The vessel was in the offing awaiting their arrival, and to the surprise of
                  Rudolph, in the skipper he recognized Captain Jake Jenkins himself. If he had had
                  any doubts as to his identity, they would have been set at rest by the buxom
                  figure of Betsy Ann seated upon the deck, busily engaged preparing vegetables for
                  cooking. In spite of the war, business seemed to have prospered with the pair, for
                  the sloop they now commanded was larger and of stronger make than the schooner on
                  which Rudolph had taken his first voyage.
               He offered his hand to the captain as an old acquaintance, and, grasping it in
                  return, Jenkins looked searchingly at him, and said:
               "Well, stranger, you clean take the shine out'n me, for I don' know you no more'n
                  the man in the moon, though the cut o' your gib does look mighty familiar."
               
               "It is now many years, Captain, since we met. In that time I have become a man,
                  though I was a well-grown youth then. I fancy Mrs. Betsy Ann will remember me
                  better than you do."
               "Ha! you know the name o' that wonderful woman of mine? Then you must be somebody
                  as has traveled with me; an' the lady, too, looks as if she knowed something of
                  us. Ah! I 'member her face now, 'caze one don't often see sich a
                  picture o' beauty. I'm blessed ef 'taint the young gal that fell in the bay, and
                  the Britisher had to leave you to fish her out. An' you, with your fine officer
                  close, ar' old Rudolph's boy. I've hearn tell o' you, youngster, an I know that
                  you've done good service to the right side. Come here, Mrs. Betsy Ann Jenkins, an'
                  welcome some old friends of ourn to our craft."
               At this summons Mrs. Jenkins leisurely arose and approached the new
                  passengers.
               "Well, I declar', now ef this isn't what I always said would happen. You've
                  married the young gal, and sent the red-coat to the right about. I told Jenkins
                  'twould end so, but he would insist that she would go with the Britisher at the
                  last."
               Alina, at these words, hastily dropped her veil to conceal the flush that arose to
                  her face, and Rudolph briefly said:
               "Yes, madam, this lady is now my wife, and we are on our way to my father's. Make
                  her as comfortable as possible, and I shall owe you many thanks."
               "That I'll do with all my heart, because she had sense to know the true metal from
                  the false. Come with me, Mrs. Rudolph, an' I'll give you a nicer cabin than you
                  had before when we had sich a time bringin' you round when you was half
                  drownded."
               Alina silently followed her, and after the sloop had set out on her voyage, the
                  captain sought Rudolph, who had placed himself at the stern, his mind filled with
                  the memories of that day which had been the starting point in his career. He
                  thought of all his hopes, his struggles to attain distinction, that he might be
                  worthy to clasp the false hand which had brought him humiliation and misery, and
                  his open brow grew so clouded, his lips closed so sternly, that Jenkins marvelled
                  what had so changed the bright and hopeful youth from whom he had parted in the
                  first bloom of life. After surveying him in silence several moments, he bluntly
                  said:
               "For a man that claims such a pretty piece of dry-goods as that ar' yonder, you
                  seem mightily cast down, Major. I reckin' you 're beginnin' to find out what I 've
                  made up my mind to long ago; that the feminine gets ahead of the
                     maskyline in this game o' mattermony. I'm an an old stager,
                     I am, an' I advise you jest to make the best o' matters, an' keep
                  the peace on any terms."
               Rudolph laughed at the quaintness of this speech, yet he shrank from the shrewd
                  observation of the man, and he quickly said:
               "If, as you insinuate, Mrs. Jenkins rules you, she must do it to your advantage,
                  for you seem to have prospered since we last met."
               "Yes—I reckin as times goes, we 've done pretty well. We 've had some misfortins,
                  but on the whole, we've come out winners. We 've done some good sarvice to the
                  continentals, an' when the old eagle spreads her wings over the land, an' all that
                  rests under our flag is free, ole Jake Jenkins can throw up his hat an' say he's
                  done his share to help on the cause."
               Rudolph warmly grasped the hand of the speaker.
               "It is a proud boast to make that our feeble efforts have all been given to ensure
                  the independence of our noble father-land. The end must soon come, and we shall
                     win the reward for which we have so
                  long struggled. Peace, with its blessings, approaches, commerce will revive, and
                  with this wide continent as our heritage, we shall go on conquering, and to
                  conquer, till the light of civilization spreads from ocean to ocean."
               "Well, Major, that is a fine speech, an' you kin talk as well as fight. I 've
                  hearn tell o' your wild charges at the head o' your troop, an' ole Rudolph of the
                  Glen is proud, with mighty good cause, of his dashing dragoon son. I'm glad to
                  take you an' your pretty wife back to the ole homestead, an' I hope you'll be able
                  to do what I never could, rule your own craft, whether it's landward
                  or seaward."
               "Thank you—I shall certainly do that," and Rudolph turned away to seek the cabin,
                  and see how Alina fared. The skipper looked after him, and shook his head, as he
                  muttered—
               "Well, ef you find that an easy job with that mettlesome critter, you're a notch
                  above me, that's all. She'll have her own way, jest as sure as Betsy Ann allers
                  gits hern, by hook or by crook."
               Rudolph found Alina lying down, and giddy from the motion of the vessel, for a
                  stiff breeze was blowing, before which they were running at a rapid rate.
               Their voyage was without incident, and they were landed safely at Havre de Grace,
                  where they found Rupert awaiting their arrival with horses for their
                  accommodation. He warmly greeted his brother, and his wife, assuring them that
                  their arrival was eagerly looked for at the Glen.
               "And how is my dear old mother?" asked Rudolph. "It seems an age since I last saw
                  her."
               A cloud passed over Rupert's face, as he replied—"I'm sorry to say she's far from
                  well. The wear and tear of all these years of fighting have told on her very
                  severely. Both of us have been in the strife; I, as I could be spared from home,
                  you all the time; and our mother is one to feel trouble deeply, though she makes
                  very little fuss about it."
               "I trust that nothing serious is the matter. It would mar the happiness of my
                  visit to find my mother really ill."
               "I did not mean to say that she is really ailing; but she is greatly changed, and
                  she begins to weary of this long war. You will find her as tender and loving as
                  ever, and your visit will be as a cordial to her. Doubly welcome will it be thus
                  accompanied, for we have always looked forward to your union with Alina as the
                  crowning event of your life. You labored for her as long as Jacob of old did for
                  his wife; but I trust your reward will be better than his was."
               Alina laughed sarcastically, and said—"I believe the old Hebrew was forced to take
                  the wrong wife after all. Your comparison may be more apropos than you think,
                  though in this case the position of the parties is reversed. In our day, events
                  often force women to do that which both reason and feeling condemn, when time for
                  reflection is given. Alas for them it is then too late to remedy the false step
                  which gives them over, bound victims, to a fate they can neither avert, nor bear
                  with the stoic's patience."
               Rupert listened to this speech in bewildered surprise. He glanced at his brother,
                  and saw the sudden paleness that crept over his bronzed face, and a glimpse of the
                  truth dawned on him, though how or why he had married Alina without the tie of
                  mutual love he could not comprehend. He made no reply, but busied himself with the
                  preparations for their departure.
               Soon they were on their way to the Glen, and with a heart that sank with every
                  advancing step, Alina rode forward in silence, while the two brothers kept up a
                  desultory conversation on affairs connected with their home in which she took no
                  interest. Rupert did not venture to allude to the evident estrangement between the
                  newly wedded pair, for he saw that in
                  the face of his brother which told him how little happiness this long-sought union
                  had brought him, and he felt the deepest sympathy for his disappointment.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               THE WIFE AND THE MOTHER.
               NIGHT had fallen before they reached the Glen, but a bright moon afforded
                  sufficient light to guide them, and they rode leisurely forward in the soft summer
                  air. Fireflies flitted before them, and the deep melodious monotone that fills the
                  forest with insect music in a Southern clime was the only audible sound.
               At length they drew near the dell in which the house was built, saw lights
                  gleaming through the shadow of the trees, and heard voices mingled with the deep
                  baying of the watch dog, aroused at the sound of their arrival. To Rudolph, this
                  was to have been the proudest and happiest moment of his life; to bring Alina to
                  his parents as the wife of his choice had been his one dream. It was realized, and
                  his heart beat with painful fears, his brow paled with bitter emotion, as the
                  moment of meeting drew near. How she would act, what her conduct might reveal in
                  that first hour he could not tell, and for his mother, he dreaded the shock that
                  awaited her.
               Mr. Rudolph, with flowing hair, now blanched to silver whiteness, stood in the
                  doorway, into which the flood of moonlight poured. He had changed greatly, and now
                  looked like a man approaching the verge of existence. His wife was on the
                  greensward in front of the house, and on her pale face and whitened hair the eyes
                  of her son first fell. He was greatly shocked, for he saw what those who were
                  daily with her had not observed, that the impress of speedy decay was on every
                  line of her noble face. Her form had lost its roundness, and her thin hands
                  trembled with emotion as she clasped them in thankful prayer that the hope and
                  darling of her life had come to her at last, bringing with him the reward of his
                  noble deeds. In voiceless emotion she clasped her son to her heart, and after
                  weeping a few tears of happiness upon his manly breast, turned to greet her new
                  daughter.
               This was a moment of painful solicitude to Rudolph: but Alina seemed touched by
                  the change in her old friend, and had the grace to refrain from wounding her in
                  the first moment of meeting. She received her caresses with a slight show of
                  emotion, and together they all entered the house. A table spread with snowy linen,
                  and loaded with every delicacy their means enabled them to afford, stood in the
                  centre of the large room, and in a few moments they had all gathered around it.
                  Mr. Rudolph bowed his head reverently, uttered a thanksgiving for the blessings
                  that still remained to them, and invoked a blessing on the wanderer who was once
                  more gathered in the fold of family love. He prayed also for the new child he had
                  brought them, and asked that the two whom fate had linked together might walk hand
                  in hand to their final rest in love and trust toward each other.
               Alas! he was soon to learn that neither existed in this ill-omened marriage; but
                  now, all Rudolph's efforts were bent on concealing his unhappiness in this first
                  hour of reunion. The supper passed off in such conversation as naturally arises
                  among the members of a family reunited after a long interval of time. The old man
                  told of the raids upon his property, how he had suffered from them, and the
                  efforts he had made to retrieve his losses; and Rudolph related some of the most
                  stirring events of his soldier-life.
               
               The mother said little; to gaze upon her son, and drink in every sound of his
                  beloved voice, as he sat before her, well and strong, after all the dangers he had
                  encountered, was happiness enough for her, and her eyes only left his face to
                  wander to that of Alina, whose pale and subdued expression she accounted for by
                  the fatigue she had lately undergone. At length, Mrs. Rudolph arose, and said:
               "It is time for Alina to retire, for she seems utterly tired out. Come with me, my
                  love, to your old room. I have carefully prepared it for you."
               "Yes—she had better go to rest," said Rudolph, glancing toward his wife. "I have
                  so much to say to my father and brother that we shall talk many hours yet."
               "Do not hurry yourself on my account," replied Alina, indifferently, and the
                  mother threw a startled glance upon her face; but she cast the momentary fear
                  away, and taking up a light, led the way to the little room, with its homely
                  carpet, and rustic furniture. It had been made gay with flowers, and everything
                  was fresh and sweet as spring itself.
               Alina recalled the last hours she had spent in that room, and with a shudder
                  thought of those that were to come. How should she exist in this dreary exile,
                  severed from everything she had learned to value in the gay and dissipated life
                  she had led since she had inhabited it? Mrs. Rudolph looked on her clouded face,
                  and she softly said:
               "My child, you are more beautiful than ever. No wonder my boy clung to you through
                  all; he adores you, Alina, and I trust that you will be happy together."
               A scornful smile flitted over the listener's face, and she bitterly replied:
               "You will soon see how much he loves me. A man who slights his wife's prayers, and
                  condemns her to such an exile as this will be to me, has very little regard for
                  anything save his own whims."
               At these words Mrs. Rudolph struggled for breath, and placed her hand suddenly
                  over her heart. The room seemed reeling before her, the earth sinking beneath her
                  feet, and her eyes fastened themselves with a stony glare upon the unfeeling
                  speaker.
               Alina was alarmed at her condition, and would have called out for assistance; but
                  she raised her hand deprecatingly, and the two sat regarding each other in
                  silence, till the elder lady recovered herself sufficiently to say:
               "It is but a spasm of the heart to which I am often subject of late. I believe I
                  shall yet die in one of them; but I am prepared to go when my Maker calls me; and
                  oh, my child, I could have wished that the summons had come before I heard such
                  words as just now fell from your lips! What can they augur, Alina? I cannot
                  believe that my noble boy, who has so long loved you, would causelessly trample
                  upon you, or abuse the power over your fate which you gave him in bestowing your
                  hand upon him."
               "He has abused it. He has forced me hither; he will leave me here, to
                  learn my lesson of obedience in a retirement that is odious to me. Does a man who
                  loves his wife part from her in the first months of their union, when he could as
                  well keep her near himself? Michael does this, and I wish that I had died before I
                  ever saw him!"
               "Why, then, did you marry him?" asked the bewildered mother. "Surely, after so
                  long a time, you must have known your own mind."
               "Alas! I did know it all too well; but I was driven on by a blind fate which has
                  sealed my wretchedness. Go to your son, Mrs. Rudolph: ask him for the sad story of
                  our wedded bliss, and let him tell you that our union is a failure,
                  so far as happiness to either of us is concerned. There—I will say no more; pray
                  leave me alone, for I am weary—weary in mind and body—weary of life itself."
               
               Alina threw herself upon the bed, covered her face, and left the trembling mother
                  to seek such information as she could gain from her son. Mrs. Rudolph feared to
                  probe a wound which had already so deeply corroded, and she turned away in dismay
                  at this unlooked for revelation, and left the room without uttering another
                  word.
               Her husband and sons were pacing to and fro in front of the house, talking
                  earnestly together, and she sat down just within the shelter of the door, absorbed
                  in painful thought. Her fears had then proved true, and the Astrologer's
                  predictions were thus far verified. The Life Curse had taken up her abode beneath
                  her roof, there to work her spells of evil against the hope of her heart. That her
                  son was in the wrong she could not believe, and what dire necessity had driven him
                  to the course of action which Alina so bitterly resented? She must know before she
                  slept, for her whole soul was in a tumult of fear for the future, and regret for
                  the irrevocable past.
               Why had Rudolph urged on this marriage without the assurance that Alina loved him?
                  He must have been bitterly deceived, for no son of hers would have clasped the
                  hand of any woman as his bride without the belief that her heart was in the
                  contract she was forming. All her old mistrust of Alina returned, and she felt
                  that through her treachery this evil had been consummated.
               Thus wearily scanning the past, and endeavoring to find some clue to the future,
                  Mrs. Rudolph sat till at length her husband said:
               "Well, lads, it grows late, and to-morrow's work must be done. We had better get
                  to rest, and be ready for its duties."
               The three entered the house, and after greeting his mother, Rudolph would have
                  passed on, but she held his hand firmly pressed in hers, and said:
               "I must talk with you, my son, before I sleep. Your father and brother have
                  monopolised you long enough, now they must leave you to me awhile."
               "'Tis the mother's right," said Mr. Rudolph. "Come, Rupert, let the lad have his
                  gossip without any listeners."
               Rupert cast a keen glance upon the two as he retired; he would have given much to
                  be able to hear what would be spoken between them, but he felt that his presence
                  would be a restraint upon the communion between the long parted mother and son,
                  and he went to his own room with an undefined feeling that their new inmate would
                  add little to the happiness of their humble home.
               Rudolph sat down beside his mother, and taking her thin hand in both his own,
                  pressed it tenderly.
               "It seems like old times, mother, to sit once more beneath the dear roof-tree, and
                  hear your sweet voice speaking to me as in the days of my boyhood. Those tones
                  have often come to me even amid the din of battle as the sweetest music of my
                  life."
               "The sweetest, lad? I thought another voice had charmed you more than mine, for it
                  sang the song of love."
               Her eyes were fixed earnestly upon him, and she saw the sudden change in his face.
                  He muttered:
               "Aye—the song of the syren, that lures to destruction."
               He caught the expression of his mother's eye, and asked, with rapid vehemence:
               "Why do you look at me thus, mother? Your eyes are brimming over with tears, and
                  there is an expression of painful supplication in them that asks—I know not
                  what."
               "It asks your confidence, my son. You cannot deceive me. I read your face, and I
                  know that a wounded heart lies in your bosom. Tell me the secret of this
                  alienation between yourself and your wife in the first months of your union?"
               
               Rudolph pressed her hand so strongly that she was ready to cry out with pain, and
                  after a struggle with himself, said:
               "Alina has then betrayed something to you. Your own observation, keen as it is,
                  could have discovered nothing from my manner, for I carefully guarded it, that I
                  might save you as long as possible from the knowledge of our un-happiness."
               "Alas! then it is true that your flower of life has withered in your grasp. Oh, my
                  poor boy, this is a cruel blow—a cruel blow——"
               "But I trust it will not prove a fatal one, mother. Do not take hope from me, for
                  without it, I shall lose all courage—all interest in life. Since Alina leaves me
                  no alternative, I must tell you all, that you may judge what chances remain of
                  winning her back to be what I once hoped she would be to me."
               "I listen with my whole heart, my son, and my assistance shall not be wanting in
                  the good work you hope to accomplish. But it is a weary task to win back an
                  alienated heart."
               "I know it; I feel it in its bitterness, but now there is no other hope left to
                  me. My wife has deceived and outraged me, but in spite of all, I feel tenderly
                  toward her yet. I would save her from evil, and awake the slumbering good that
                  must be in every soul created by the Master of life. I could not watch over her
                  myself, and I have brought her to you, hoping that your tender heart and noble
                  nature will, in time, act on hers, and bring forth such sweet and womanly
                  qualities as must exist in that form of unrivalled beauty."
               His mother sighed heavily, for she had no such faith in the nature confided to her
                  charge; she felt that Rudolph was fascinated by the external loveliness of the
                  object of his choice, and deluded himself with the belief that it was the type of
                  mental excellence yet to be unfolded; but she said nothing to dash his hopes; they
                  were all that remained to him now, so let him cherish them. She said:
               "Give me a history of your marriage. Conceal nothing from me, for between you and
                  your wife I have a delicate and difficult part to play."
               With rapid utterance, Rudolph related the whole story as Alina had told it to him;
                  his mother listened appalled, and when he paused, she breathlessly asked:
               "She told you that she loved another? That she would break her
                  marriage vow to fly with him? Alas! this reckless hardihood in error is the worst
                  feature of all."
               "No, mother—on that very candor—that very freedom from hypocrisy, I build my hopes
                  of our ultimate reunion. Alina did wrong to give me her hand while her heart was
                  in possession of another, but she could not make her life a lie. She had courage
                  to speak the truth, and on that can I base my renewed confidence in her, when she
                  returns to her allegiance to me. She is now forever separated from De Vere, and in
                  time, my forbearance, my continued affection must touch her heart. Be very gentle
                  with her, mother, and her wayward and capricious temper will soften beneath your
                  tender influence. Aid me to win back my darling, and we shall yet be a happy and
                  united pair."
               "God grant it, my son: I will dedicate the remnant of my life to this holy
                  purpose, and all that a mother's heart can accomplish, shall be done by me."
               "And you must, you shall succeed. But why speak thus of yourself, mother? You
                  shall live many years to witness my happiness; the war must now speedily come to a
                  close, and I shall return unscathed, as heretofore, to make a home for myself, in
                  which Alina shall reside, and you will often be our cherished guest."
               Mrs. Rudolph held up her thin hand, and faintly smiled.
               
               "My time on earth is short; I have long felt this, my son; but I am resigned to
                  the will of the All-Father. The frequent alarms I have endured—the wearing anxiety
                  for those I love, has produced disease of the heart, which may, at any moment,
                  prove fatal. It is right to tell you this, that the shock of my sudden death may
                  not come too severely upon you."
               "Oh, mother, darling, precious mother, do not—do not speak of leaving us. We
                  cannot give you up in the very meridian of our days. You are not old—there is
                  vital strength in your frame yet, to resist this insidious disease, and something
                  must be done for you."
               There was such passionate sorrow in his tones that she was deeply touched. She
                  calmly said:
               "Quiet your fears, Michael, for I am in no immediate danger; and if quieter times
                  come, if no sudden shock reaches me, I may last a long time yet. Medicine cannot
                  benefit me; therefore I have not asked the advice of a physician."
               "What do you suffer from, mother?"
               "Only a giddy feeling of exhaustion, and at moments a sensation as if the earth is
                  sinking away beneath my feet. But now I shall be better. Your visit has acted on
                  me as a renovating cordial, and the task you have delegated to me will give new
                  interest to my life. I will do all that is possible to restore Alina to her true
                  self, and make her sensible of her responsibility to a higher power for the acts
                  done in this life. There is where the true foundation is lacking, I fear, and
                  without that there is no hope of abiding excellence."
               "Only make her like yourself, my sweet mother, and you will twice have given me
                  life. I trust all to you. But I am keeping you up too late. Rest in peace and
                  hope; do not let this confidence drive from you the repose you so much need."
               He kissed her, and led her to the door of her room, then returned to pace up and
                  down the yard the greater portion of the night in spite of the fatigue of the
                  previous day. Toward dawn, he threw himself upon a wide, old-fashioned sofa which
                  stood in the family room, and fell into a heavy sleep, which lasted till the noise
                  of the servant setting the table for the morning meal aroused him.
               He arose, went into Alina's room, and found her still sleeping. He looked down on
                  her with infinite love and compassion in his eyes, with the painful doubt
                  struggling in his mind that, after all, the confident hopes he had expressed to
                  his mother might never be realized. Probably disturbed by the magnetic power of
                  his glance, she moved restlessly in her sleep and muttered:
               "Go away—leave me—leave me. You are fatal to me, and I not less so to you."
               The words were uttered faintly, and at intervals, but they were quite distinct,
                  and his heart sank within him, for they seemed to him, in his state of wretched
                  excitement, the very utterances of Fate itself. Rudolph turned away sick at heart,
                  and wandered toward the sheltered walk in which he had so often loitered with
                  Alina, bearing within his boyish heart the charmed belief that they were as much
                  formed for each other as the first pair that came from the divine hand. The
                  difference between now and then was too great; his strong soul was wrung with
                  agony, and he precipitately turned from the well-known path, and walked he knew
                  not, cared not whither, till the voice of his brother arrested him.
               "Where to now, Michael? Looking over the old place? but it seems to me you don't
                  see anything before you, for you came near walking over me."
               "I believe I was too much absorbed in thought to observe where I was wandering. It
                  must be near the breakfast hour. Shall we return to the house?"
               
               "Aye, as soon as I have put up these bars. This is late for our morning meal, but
                  mother thought your lady wife would be tired and indisposed to rise early, so she
                  ordered it an hour later than usual."
               "Alina never gets up to breakfast, so my mother need not put herself out of her
                  usual way on her account. She has adopted the English fashion of taking only tea
                  and toast at that meal, and that can be prepared for her at any time."
               "Really—a nice farmer's wife she'll make, upon my word. You mean to be a farmer, I
                  believe, when all this fighting is over?"
               "Perhaps so—I cannot say. Fate may fix me in a city, and on some accounts, perhaps
                  that will be best."
               "That means on Alina's account. The country won't suit her, and your plan of life
                  must be altered to conform to her tastes. I'll tell you one thing, Michael, I'd
                  make my own nest in my own way, and give my mate to understand that she must find
                  shelter and happiness there, or nowhere with me."
               Rudolph flushed deeply.
               "You are thinking of Alina's imprudent words yesterday evening, and you fancy that
                  we are already at dagger's points. It has not quite come to that yet, Rupert, and
                  as I wish to have happiness in my home, I decline playing the arbitrary part you
                  advise. The nest must be agreeable, or the bird will seek to fly from it,
                  perhaps."
               His brother looked keenly at him, and said:
               "If that is your fear, it would be wisest perhaps to——Yet no—I will
                  not say that, my dear Michael, for I know how fondly your heart has been set on
                  this bewitching creature. Alina is certainly as lovely as a dream, but I am afraid
                  she will not seek to make you happy in your own way. She feels her power, and she
                  will abuse it—it's a woman's nature, I believe."
               "That is a strange sentiment to fall from the lips of our mother's son, Rupert;
                  for a truer, or better woman never lived."
               "Yes—but who is like our mother? If I could find another as good as
                  she is, I'd marry her the minute she'd say yes; but I never expect to, and
                  therefore I'm booked for an old bachelor."
               "Don't despair too soon. I appreciate my mother as highly as you can, and I have
                  brought my wife to her to be trained by her hand."
               Rupert suppressed the whistle that arose to his lips, and, after a pause,
                  said:
               "I hope she may succeed, that's all. So now, old fellow, let's in to breakfast,
                  for I am half famished."
               The family met at the morning repast, and Rudolph saw by the searching light of
                  day that his mother was more wan and emaciated than he had believed it possible
                  for one of her former robust appearance. At intervals, there was a fluttering
                  color upon her cheek, and her eyes glittered with a light that was evidently the
                  offspring of disease; but she smiled upon him with all her old sweetness, and
                  insensibly his wounded heart was soothed by the consciousness that to one human
                  being, at least, he was dear and precious as her very life.
               Late in the day, Alina's breakfast was prepared and taken in to her, much to the
                  disgust of her father-in-law, for Mr. Rudolph was an industrious and hard-working
                  man, and he had little toleration for what he considered fine lady airs. For
                  Michael's sake he repressed the expression of his dissatisfaction, but he wondered
                  if Alina intended to be a burden to his failing wife in their narrow household.
                  They could afford to keep but one servant, and that was an elderly negress who had
                  lived with them for many years. Chloe's best working-days were over, and already
                  too much devolved upon the mistress of
                  the family. The losses they had suffered had curtailed their means, and if this
                  dainty young lady remained with them she must at least learn to wait upon herself,
                  and keep the same hours as were kept by the rest of the family.
               A few minutes before the early dinner was served Alina made her appearance,
                  looking languid and depressed. She scarcely touched the food that was placed
                  before her, and seemed indifferent to the impression she might produce. Mr.
                  Rudolph observed her closely, and toward the close of the meal bluntly said:
               "I don't wonder you can't eat, daughter, when you've taken your breakfast only an
                  hour ago. But I must say that I never saw a young bride look as downcast as you
                  do. Cheer up, child, for Michael will come back safe and sound, as he always has
                  done. The same Providence is over him now that has hitherto protected him so
                  wonderfully."
               Alina raised her eyes defiantly, and the wicked thought arose in her heart that if
                  she could regain her freedom even by the death of her husband in the battle's
                  strife, she would scarcely weep over his untimely fate. She repressed the reply
                  that struggled to her lips, and coldly said:
               "I have few fears for Major Rudolph. He can protect himself, as he has heretofore
                  done. I am not well to-day, so you will excuse my depression."
               She arose abruptly and walked out of the house.
               The old man looked at his son, but he affected to be busily engaged with his
                  dinner, and no comment was made on the strange conduct of Alina.
               When Mr. Rudolph found himself alone with his wife, he said:
               "Our son is a young eagle, who has mated with a paroquet. Alina thinks that fine
                  feathers make fine birds, and in her heart she despises us and our ways. It will
                  be a bitter lesson to her to learn to accommodate herself to them. The lad had
                  better take her away with him when he goes, for she will only be a care and a
                  worry to you."
               "My dear, old man, don't talk in this way, for Michael would be deeply hurt if he
                  thought his wife is not welcome beneath his father's roof. Alina must remain with
                  us for a season, and I hope to be of some use to her in teaching her such lessons
                  of life as a motherless girl has had little chance to learn. Be patient with her,
                  and you will soon return to your old fondness for her."
               "Well, I don't deny that I loved the pretty creature that came to us in her
                  desolation for help and comfort; but this stuck-up young woman is no more like her
                  than a flaunting hollyhock is like a sweet moss-rosebud. She don't really care for
                  Michael, or she would make an effort to appear well to his family."
               "Their engagement lasted many years," replied Mrs. Rudolph, evasively; "and why
                  should she have fulfilled it, if not from love?"
               "Aye, why should she, indeed? She's uncommonly pretty, and has been spoiled,
                  perhaps. In that case the lad was right to bring her to you, for if any mortal can
                  bring her round gently, you can do it, Serena. Your god-mother gave you the most
                  fitting of names, my dear wife, for you have calmed many a tempest for me, and you
                  may prevent future ones for our boy, by taming this skittish young creature, and
                  teaching her the true duties of life."
               "Thank you, dear; your praise is always sweet to me. I will do the best I can, and
                  the result we must leave to a higher power."
               "But you must not take too much on yourself. I'll not have you overtasking
                  yourself to minister to her dainty notions."
               "Leave all that to me; only do not interfere between Alina and myself, and she will soon fall into her
                  place quite naturally. The sweet child that left us years ago will come back to
                  nestle near our hearts, and make our lonely home more cheerful than it has lately
                  been. There—trust to me, old man, and all will be well. Say nothing to Michael,
                  for he would be hurt if he thought his wife is not as welcome to you as he himself
                  is."
               "She's welcome enough for that matter, but I only wish he could stay to look after
                  her himself. After he goes away, she'll be moping herself to death, and if the
                  news of a battle comes without hearing that he is safe, between you, I shall have
                  a time of it. Well—well—patience, and things will come round right."
               In trouble, this was the usual mode of consolation adopted by Mr. Rudolph, and his
                  wife made her invariable reply to his closing remark:
               "Yes—patience can bear all, conquer all," and their conference closed.
               That evening Rudolph left for Havre de Grace. Before setting out, he held a long
                  conversation with Alina, in which he placed before her their exact position, and
                  entreated her by all their hopes of happiness to yield to the influence of his
                  mother; to cultivate the sweet and gentle graces which rendered her so dear to her
                  family; and, above all, to think of him as ready to fly to her side when she
                  summoned him there as her faithful and tender protector throughout life.
               Alina listened with a bitter and stubborn feeling of perverseness; she gave him no
                  pledge, no hope for the future; and when he finally parted from her, she passively
                  received the kisses he pressed upon her brow and lips. At the last moment she
                  averted her eyes from him, and he went forth almost despairing as to the result of
                  this seclusion from which he had hoped so much.
               The parting between mother and son was deeply affecting; she said everything that
                  could reassure him in this hour of bitter trial, and he blessed her for the spring
                  of comfort she opened to his parched and thirsting soul. Like water in the desert,
                  it gave new life to his fainting spirit, and he went on his way calmed and
                  strengthened for whatever might lay before him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE SERPENT ON THE PATH.
               IN the months that slowly followed the departure of Rudolph, his mother often had
                  cause to despond over the task she had undertaken. Alina passed her days in
                  listless vacancy, taking no interest in anything that went on around her, and
                  often betraying bitter disgust for the homely details of life among people of
                  straitened means, who literally earned their bread by the sweat of the brow.
               The example of daily sacrifice—the strong bond of union that existed in this
                  virtuous family, had no charm, no significance to her. She loathed the monotony of
                  their existence and pined for the excitements which had become a necessary aliment
                  to her being. Her feelings, in place of softening toward her husband, became more
                  bitterly resentful at the probation imposed on her. What right had he, she asked,
                  to tear her from all that was desirable to her, and immure her in this living
                  tomb, to drag out her youth in repining and discontent?
               Her thoughts turned to De Vere and the widely different fate he could have given
                  her, and she watched with intense solicitude for some token that she was still
                  unforgotten. In France his exchange
                  could more easily be effected than if he had been brought to America, for from
                  there he could appeal to powerful friends to aid in freeing him, and she
                  confidently looked forward to seeing him again beside her.
               Yet time passed on, and he came not. Months slowly rolled away, and she heard
                  nothing from him. The cold conviction settled upon her heart that he had given her
                  up, and after a wild paroxysm of weeping and despair she calmed herself, and
                  examined her actual position. Since it was impossible to attain the brilliant
                  position for which she was ready to sacrifice all that is dear to her sex, she
                  must make the best of that which her evil fate had assigned her. She could not
                  much longer endure the life she was leading, and her only avenue of escape from it
                  was through the renewed confidence of Rudolph. She must regain her power over him,
                  and to do this, it was necessary to play the part of the reformed and devoted
                  wife.
               She would begin by a change of conduct toward his family, and gradually she seemed
                  to awaken to a perception of the duties she had so long and systematically
                  neglected. The heart of the fond mother was cheered by evidences of returning
                  interest in the common cares of life; Alina became almost tender and thoughtful
                  for her; she began quietly to aid her in many little ways; to talk with her
                  cheerfully of the future, and even to refer to the return of Rudolph as an event
                  to be desired by her, and express contrition for the coldness with which she had
                  treated him. One day she said:
               "You know all, mother—for I am aware that Michael confided the history of our
                  marriage to you. That is the reason that I have so hardened my heart against you.
                  I thought you were sitting up in judgment upon me, and condemning me for what I
                  know was wrong; but I have been under evil influences since I left you. My uncle's
                  wife gave me no clear perceptions of right, and it is only since I have been
                  thrown under your care—have daily seen you bear the crosses of life with the
                  patience of an angel, that I begin to comprehend what a true woman is. I have been
                  very stubborn, and very hard-hearted, but you have conquered me at last by the
                  force of your own goodness."
               Alina wore an air of perfect sincerity, and Mrs. Rudolph wept glad tears over her
                  as she pressed her to her bosom, and called her by every endearing name.
               "Oh, my child, this hour repays me for all! I have prayed for you daily, and
                  hourly, and God has deigned to hear and answer my supplications. My poor boy will
                  yet be happy with you; he will love you more dearly than ever."
               "Ah! I have wounded him so deeply that I fear he can never forgive me. If
                  repentance could win Michael back, I would do all that a woman—a wife may do to
                  accomplish it; but his letters to me are so cold—mere bulletins of the state of
                  his health, and the nature of the service he is engaged in. Once they were filled
                  with passionate protestations of regard; but alas! I have forfeited my right to
                  his love, and I should not complain that it is withdrawn from me."
               "It is not, Alina. With renewed confidence, the affection of Michael will regain
                  all its strength. You have been the idol of his life, and if you could have heard
                  him speak of the future in connection with yourself, when he told me his sad
                  story, you would know that on you still depends all his hopes of renewed
                  happiness. I do not scruple to tell you this now, for your heart is at last
                  turning to him, and he will prize it as dearly as if it had never known
                  estrangement."
               "Ah, I have been blind and stupid. Michael is the noblest of men, and, had we
                  never been parted, I should have continued to regard him as such. The one I
                  learned to prefer to him was not his equal; but his worldly advantages tages were great, and my ambition and
                  love of admiration led me into the snare which has caused us both such bitter
                  wretchedness. Dear mother, how shall I convince Michael that I have recovered my
                  right reason? that I repent of the past, and will endeavor to make him happy."
               "Write to him such a letter as your feelings will dictate, Alina. Heal the wounds
                  you have given him, and woo back the love that is legitimately your due. Only
                  convince my son that you are sincere, and he will meet you half way,
                  only too happy to be reconciled."
               Alina pondered on this advice; but, with the subtle tact which distinguished her,
                  she felt that the change must not be too sudden, or Rudolph would mistrust her. He
                  should gradually see the dawning of a better day, and from each succeeding letter
                  gain a new ray of hope in her slowly awakening love. With consummate skill she
                  accomplished this. She also kept a journal in which she recorded her feelings day
                  by day, and suffered this to fall accidentally under the eye of his mother. After
                  a faint show of opposition, she permitted Mrs. Rudolph to read the struggles there
                  recorded—to see the efforts of a benighted soul striving back to the better path
                  from which it had so long departed.
               Alina had great talent for composition, and much creative power; she could write
                  beautifully of virtue, and sublime sacrifice to right; and on those pages she had
                  lavished all her art, for they were to win back the love that was to place her in
                  the sphere she panted to re-enter.
               Her letters to Rudolph assumed a warmer tone, and gleams of the sweetness of
                  nature he had once believed her birthright, cheered his solitary pilgrimage as an
                  oasis springing in the arid desert of his life. How dearly they were cherished;
                  how fondly welcomed every generous heart can understand. He replied to them, and
                  their correspondence lost its hard official tone. In time, they wrote like lovers
                  to each other; and the arrival of the journal, surreptitiously sent to him by his
                  mother, completed the reconciliation between them. Alina was once more his own,
                  and he wrote to her:—
               
                  "I only await your summons to come to your side. The great victory we have so
                     long striven for is at last ours; Yorktown has surrendered to the
                     Commander-in-Chief, and it is confidently believed that peace must now soon be
                     declared. But a greater victory is yours, my beloved Alina, in restoring
                     yourself to your true place in my heart. How it has yearned for this hour of
                     renewed confidence I cannot tell, for words are inadequate to express my
                     grateful joy in the prospects that open before me.
                  "My mother has sent me your journal, and from its affecting records I learned
                     to value more highly than ever the regard of such a being as you there prove
                     yourself to have become. The noble nature has asserted itself, and I trust you
                     as implicitly as in the first days of our union. Beloved Alina, I only await
                     your recall to obtain a furlough and fly to your side. Write to me without
                     delay, for I shall prepare everything for a speedy departure when your missive
                     arrives."
               
               Alina read this letter with triumph with which was mingled not one emotion of
                  tenderness toward its writer. She could tolerate him; could play her part
                  naturally, and gracefully enough to satisfy her husband; and she resolved to be
                  more circumspect in her social intercourse. Rudolph's jealous self-respect must
                  not again be wounded by any appearance of levity on her part. The lesson she had
                  learned had at least taught her the necessity of acting toward her admirers with
                  that reticence becoming to her position as a wife.
               She pondered on all these things, and arranged her future course of action. She then joined Mrs.
                  Rudolph with a beaming face, and announced the speedy return of her son. The news
                  soon spread through the house, and every face wore a smiling aspect. Rupert
                  heartily congratulated her, and the old man blessed her fervently. Of late, her
                  changed demeanor had worked upon him, and he was beginning to love her as much as
                  in the days of her early girlhood. He set down much of her waywardness to grief at
                  her separation from her husband, for his wife had been careful not to betray to
                  him the actual position of affairs, and he pardoned her for it on that
                  account.
               Alina wrote a long and tender letter to Rudolph, entreating him to return as
                  speedily as possible, assuring him that the fatal hallucination which had marred
                  their happiness, had passed away, and she was now truly and devotedly his own. Her
                  words were calculated to reassure the most mistrustful nature, and she well knew
                  that she had to deal with one who was all openness and truth.
               How rapturously that letter was read—what delicious tears of joy were wept over
                  its pages, can well be imagined. To it his mother had added a few lines confirming
                  his newborn hopes, and urging him to return to the Glen without delay, as a
                  welcome was preparing for him more joyful than that which met the return of the
                  prodigal son when he came back to the home of his father. A brief reply was
                  returned:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I shall be with you in twenty-four hours after this reaches you. Oh,
                              joyful reunion after so dire a probation. My heart is filled with glad
                              gratitude to the Great Disposer of events, who has brought good out of
                              evil, and given me back the treasure of my heart. Oh! Alina, let us,
                              by our future lives, illustrate the noble humanity that God has given
                              us; let our days be a continual offering of good works to Him who has
                              extricated us from the slough of Despond, and placed us on the
                              pinnacle of happiness. Yours, my darling, in tenderness and truth.
                           
                              "M. RUDOLPH."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Alina read the letter twice, and a faint, contemptuous smile gleamed upon her lips
                  as she thought how easily he had again become her dupe. Good works from
                     her! She wondered how she was to perform them, and if he would
                  really require her to become a saint, in outward seeming at least.
               Well—even that she would undertake, to bind Rudolph to her again, till her
                  influence was paramount over every other. She carried his letter to his parents,
                  received their kiss of congratulation, and then said:
               "I am going to the leafy walk to dream of Michael. To-morrow evening he will
                  wander with me there in renewed happiness."
               She smiled brightly as she passed out of the house, and the old man said to his
                  wife:
               "I declare she is the prettiest creature under the sun, and I don't wonder the lad
                  is infatuated with her."
               "Yes—she is very lovely, and I trust she is now as good as she is beautiful."
               "You have been a saving providence to her, Serena, and Michael may thank you for
                  this happiness."
               She smiled serenely, and together they watched the receding figure of Alina,
                  unconscious that the serpent was upon her path, and that she was hastening now to
                  throw herself within his very coils.
               The gnarled trees cast their shadows upon the winding pathway, and the evening sun
                  glinted through the openings between them. In this spot the birds were never
                  molested, and the flutter of their wings, the glad musical chirp with which they greeted each other, were the
                  only sounds that broke the stillness of the evening.
               Alina wandered slowly onward, musing on the new career about to open before her
                  and trying to school her rebellious heart to the task she had set herself. She had
                  gained the farthest extremity of the alley, when she was suddenly startled by
                  something falling at her feet. She looked around, but saw nothing, and after a
                  moment of hesitation, stooped and picked up a roll of twisted paper which bore no
                  address. She rapidly opened it, and became as pale and nearly as cold as marble,
                  as the words traced within met her eyes:
               "I am here; do not cry out, lest you betray my presence."
               She had no voice to utter a sound, and with a feeling of utter bewilderment she
                  looked toward a dense thicket of underwood from which the note must have been
                  thrown. She heard the crashing of boughs, saw the figure of a man breaking through
                  them, and the next instant she was clasped, half-fainting, in the arms of De Vere:
                  his eager voice was pouring forth a torrent of passionate joy at their
                  reunion.
               In that moment, Alina had no thought but for him. To her, Rudolph was as
                  completely annihilated as though he did not exist. The lover who adored her, whose
                  passion she returned, held her to his heart, assured her of his unchanged
                  devotion, and she would fly with him even if death, desolation, despair were left
                  behind her.
               Her fate now lay in her own hands, and she would mould it to her wishes. She
                  murmured:
               "Oh, Lionel, why—why have you tarried so long? My heart has been almost broken by
                  the fear that you had forgotten me."
               "Then you have not permitted this accursed Rudolph, who gained you by a fraud, to
                  become my rival. You love me yet, Alina?"
               "Ever—ever—I have even told him that I love you. I have entreated him
                  to give me back my freedom, that I might go with you, and as my punishment he
                  banished me to this dreary spot, where I have dreamed only of you, and yearned for
                  your return."
               "And I, Alina, have suffered the tortures of the Inferno in these long months of
                  enforced absence."
               He placed her on a rustic seat at the termination of the walk, sat down beside
                  her, and went on:
               "I have met with many trying adventures since we last parted. The transport that
                  bore me to France was attacked by an Algerine corsair of superior force, taken,
                  and carried into the harbor of Tripoli. I was detained there in bondage till my
                  own government was notified of my situation, and after a thousand difficulties, I
                  was at last liberated. I hastened immediately to England, to obtain the funds
                  necessary to return here and bear you away. I lost no time in setting out; I
                  landed at Baltimore, and with some difficulty made my way hither. Since mid-day I
                  have been in this vicinity watching for your appearance; several times I have
                  approached quite near the house, but the baying of the watch-dog warned me to
                  retire again. I hoped that you would take an evening stroll, and when I saw you
                  coming I concealed myself in yonder covert and scribbled the words I threw at your
                  feet. To-night we must fly together; I will take you to Baltimore, where a priest
                  shall perform the true marriage service for us, and once mine by the rites of the
                  only true church, I defy man to separate us again."
               "Yes"—replied Alina in a subdued tone—"We must go without delay, for Rudolph
                  returns to-morrow to take me away with him when he leaves again, and this will
                     be our only opportunity to secure an
                  uninterrupted flight. Rupert is absent from the farm on business; the old people
                  will suspect nothing, and I can join you at any hour after nine to-night."
               "I will be here at that time, and watch for you till you come. A quarter of a mile
                  below, my servant waits with our horses, and every arrangement is made to secure a
                  safe and speedy journey. Take nothing with you that you will not absolutely need,
                  as you can procure all you may want in Baltimore. We shall be detained there till
                  a vessel sails, but we are strangers to every one, and there will be little danger
                  of detection. You have no shrinking—no hesitation, Alina? You do not believe
                  yourself legally bound to Rudolph, and in your heart there are no lingering
                  regrets, on his account?"
               There was one faint pang at the thought of the scathing blow she was about to
                  inflict upon her forsaken husband, but her voice was steady, and her cheek
                  unblanched, as she replied:
               "None; I have no thought but for love and you. I repudiate the tie that was
                  cemented through the treachery of Helen, and give my hand to you with the internal
                  assurance that you are my soul-mate, and the lawful ruler of my destiny."
               De Vere expressed his thanks with ardor, and after a pause Alina asked:
               "Have you seen my aunt or cousin since your release? I have not heard from them
                  since we parted."
               "I called on Mrs. Fitzhugh in London during my brief stay there. She is lodging in
                  the city, and Helen is at a finishing school near her. She spoke kindly of you,
                  though she said that you had never written to her since her return to
                  England."
               "What had I to say?" asked Alina, bitterly. "Should I have given Helen the triumph
                  of learning that I was miserable in the marriage she had been the cause of my
                  forming? Truly, my pride was too great for that, therefore I remained silent. My
                  life since we saw each other, has been a wretched dream of discontent, and the
                  best thing I could do, was to keep my unhappiness to myself."
               "And now, I trust, it is forever ended, my beloved. I will give you high station,
                  wealth, adoring affection, and we can easily elude the search of Rudolph if he
                  should be mad enough to attempt to regain you."
               She grew pale.
               "Oh! yes—let us keep out of his reach, for he has sworn to kill you if I proved
                  false to him, he is a man to keep his word."
               De Vere laughed scornfully.
               "Yes, he threw down the gauntlet years ago; but have no fears, Alina, for I shall
                  not be fool enough to take it up. In this wide world there is space enough to
                  avoid any one we do not choose to meet. Rudolph's destiny chains him to this
                  country, ours takes us to England. Should he follow us there, we will go to the
                  continent, and travel till he is weary of seeking us. It will be easy enough to
                  evade him, and I have no idea of ever standing face to face with him. His insolent
                  rivalry will be sufficiently punished when I take you from him."
               "Yes," she vaguely said. "It will be bitter—bitter. He will hate, will loathe me;
                  but even that is better than his love."
               "His love! Do not speak of it, Alina; never allude to this man again;
                  let him be buried in utter oblivion, for he has long enough been the dark shadow
                  on our path."
               Alina placed her hand in his, and said:
               "I will not; from this hour, he is to me as though he had never existed. I think
                  of, dream of, live only for you. At
                  half past nine, I will join you on this spot, to leave it forever with all its
                  hateful associations far behind me. I go with an undivided heart, for you are my
                  hope, my trust, my only dependence in the future."
               He fervently uttered his thanks, and together they sat discussing their plans, and
                  talking over that past till twilight gathered around them. Then Alina tore herself
                  away, and De Vere watched her retreating form as long as it was visible, with the
                  rapturous emotions of a lover on the eve of winning all that was most precious to
                  him in life.
               He had feared that he should find her changed either in person or in feeling; but
                  he found her more charming than ever; and for the first time when face to face,
                  she had permitted him to look into her heart, and see that it was devoted to
                  himself alone.
               Carried away by the absorbing passion Alina had inspired in his breast, De Vere
                  was resolute to gain her at all hazards; he believed that Rudolph would scarcely
                  think his false love worth pursuing or contending for; but if he should do so; if
                  he found means to demand satisfaction for his blighted home and crushed
                  affections, he would kill him as coolly as he would shoot down a brigand upon his
                  path.
               He sat down at last, to collect his thoughts, and rest a little before the night
                  ride that awaited him.
               Alina found supper on the table, and she took her usual seat in a tumult of
                  thought and feeling which she could not entirely conceal. She scarcely tasted the
                  food that was before her, and Mr. Rudolph laughed, and said:
               "Joy has taken away your appetite, daughter. Eat, that you may be fresh and rosy
                  when my boy comes back. I wish him to see that we have taken good care of
                  you."
               "Give me a cup of tea, ma mère," she said, with
                  a strange smile, "for I am too happy to care for any other food."
               She drank the tea, arose quickly, and passed into her own room. The deluded
                  parents looked at each other, and both said:
               "How much she loves him. How happy he will be;" and in that belief they
                  retired.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               RUDOLPH'S RECEPTION AT HOME.
               ON the following morning, breakfast was served at the usual hour, but Alina did
                  not appear. As she had given up her habit of taking that meal in her own
                  apartment, Mrs. Rudolph knocked on her door, and called to her; no answer was
                  returned, and fearing she might be ill, she unclosed the door and looked in.
               There was no sign of Alina, and to her dismay the bed had evidently not been slept
                  in on the previous night. Her heart gave a wild bound, the room swam before her,
                  but she recovered sufficiently to approach the rustic stand, on which a paper was
                  conspicuously placed. Her eyes fell upon the lines traced on it, and she read,
                  with fluttering breath, the following words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I have left your roof forever. I go with him I love, and pursuit
                              would be useless, for I will die sooner than be separated from him. My
                              cruel position forced on me the deception of which I have been guilty.
                              Let your son console himself for the loss of one who could never have
                              made him happy, and, in time, he will feel that I have done that which
                              was best for him and for myself.
                           
                              "ALINA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               
                  Gone! Michael coming in love and trust, to find this envenomed shaft
                  ready to pierce his heart! The shock was more than the fond mother had strength to
                  bear; her eyes failed her; her heart, so long fluttering with feeble power,
                  stopped its beating forever; and Mrs. Rudolph fell lifeless upon the floor.
               Chloe and her master both heard the fall, and they rushed into the room at the
                  same moment to find her extended upon the carpet, clutching the fatal paper in a
                  death grasp which could not be loosened. They raised her, placed her upon the bed,
                  and used every restorative known to them. Their efforts were vain, for the spirit
                  had already departed; though it was long before her husband could be made to
                  comprehend that it was really so. Stunned and bewildered, Mr. Rudolph could not
                  understand what had really happened, and in piteous accents he kept crying
                  out—
               "Where is Alina? Why does she not come to help me bring back life to my poor
                  Serena. She is not dead; no—no—she cannot be dead. Don't say such a word, Chloe,
                  for I won't have it," and with trembling hands he bathed the wan face, and tried
                  to bring back circulation to the chilling hands by clasping them between his
                  own.
               "What is this paper she holds so fast? 'Twas this that killed her. Oh, Holy
                  Father, what can all this mean?"
               By tearing the paper slightly he succeeded in removing it, and glanced over the
                  lines traced upon it; but his vision was too much impaired to permit him to
                  ascertain its meaning. He looked helplessly around for his glasses, and at that
                  moment the rapid approach of steps was heard, and the joyous voices of the two
                  brothers talking with animation reached the ears of the old man.
               Rudolph had anticipated the time of his expected arrival, and he was already
                  beneath that blighted roof, where desertion and death awaited him in place of the
                  tender welcome he had expected.
               "Hilloa!" cried Rupert, "here's breakfast untouched and nobody to sit down to it.
                  Where's mother?—where's Alina?"
               "You are so impatient, Rupert," said Rudolph. "Seek mother, and tell her that I am
                  here, while I go into Alina's room and give her a sweet surprise."
               He bounded rapidly toward it; but at the entrance of his anticipated Eden, he met
                  the dusky face of Chloe like a warning apparition. She hastily whispered, "Don' go
                  in thar, Marse Michael; don', for de sight you'll find thar'll break
                  your heart."
               He staggered against the wall.
               "Is Alina ill? What has happened to her?"
               "Nothin' as I knows on; but she aint in thar, nor no wheres about here, I
                  reckin."
               He seized the old woman, and shook her violently.
               "How dare you speak thus of my wife? Not here—where then is she?"
               "I don' no," gasped Chloe. "She's gone, an' one dats better'n her is gone too;
                  yes—she's gone to God."
               Rudolph listened, without comprehending her meaning. A deep groan reached his ear,
                  rent from his father's heart by the sound of his voice, and the certainty of the
                  dreadful anguish he came to face.
               What was going on in that room? Was Alina dying?—dead? Who had gone to God? What
                  could the poor negress mean by her strange words? Rudolph put her aside with a
                  strong hand, strode into the room, and saw the lifeless body of his mother, with
                  his father crouching near it, still holding the paper before his eyes, though no
                  longer attempting to decipher its contents.
               With a cry of anguish he threw himself forward, grasped the cold hands, and buried
                  his face in the bedclothes. The old man whispered—
               
               Michael, help me to bring her to. She's only fainted. Come, lad, it's not too late
                  to bring her round yet."
               Rudolph raised his pallid face, and asked—
               "How has this happened, and where is my wife, that she is not beside my mother at
                  such a time as this?"
               His father put his hand to his head in a feeble manner—
               "I don't know—I cannot understand. Alina wasn't here, she may have gone out to
                  walk. Read this for me, Michael; I found it in your mother's hand, but my poor old
                  eyes can't make it out."
               Rudolph grasped the paper, glanced over it, and comprehended the dire meaning of
                  the scene before him. Alina had filled the measure of her perfidy, and the shock
                  of its discovery had destroyed his mother.
               A wild tempest surged within him, but outwardly he was calm; in the presence of
                  death, beside the bereaved old man, he must control himself. He took the hand of
                  his father tenderly in his own, and said:
               "Let me lead you away, father. My mother has gone to join the angels, and it is
                  well, for she has escaped great misery here."
               "But what does the paper say, and where is your wife?"
               "I have no wife," he sternly replied. "She who bore that sacred name is now no
                  more to me than the dead flower broken from its stalk and cast into oblivion.
                  Alina has fled with her lover; the knowledge of this gave a death-blow to my
                  mother. That is what this paper reveals."
               He spoke with such stony calmness, that Rupert, who had entered the room, and was
                  kneeling beside the death-couch, arose, and took his hand:
               "My poor Michael, this is too much—too much to bear. When you hoped for
                  everything, she has but lured you back to strike a more deadly blow; but she could
                  not think its recoil would prove fatal to our mother."
               "She cared not if it did. Speak no more of her, Rupert, false as fair, let her
                  float down the turbid tide on which she has chosen to embark. I shall know how to
                  right myself, and punish her."
               The last words were muttered so low, that Rupert did not understand them.
               All their care was now given to the bereaved old man, whose grief was most
                  affecting to witness. His wife had been the companion and stay of his life, and
                  this sudden wrenching apart of the tie that bound them together overwhelmed him
                  with sorrow. Rudolph stifled the wild emotions that struggled for mastery over
                  him, to minister to his father; and in the dreary interval that elapsed from the
                  death of Mrs. Rudolph to the day of her burial, he strove to put from him his own
                  blighting sorrow, that he might retain outward composure for the duties that lay
                  before him.
               All the time he could spare from the old man was passed beside the death couch,
                  and over those hours of anguish a veil must be drawn. The heart alone "knoweth its
                  own bitterness," and over such grief as his, the eye of Omniscience alone should
                  hold its watch. Henceforth he had no tie on earth; his feeble old father must soon
                  sink into the grave treachery had dug for him, and his brother had no more need of
                  him. Their paths had long been separate, and now they must be still more widely
                  severed, for hence-forth he had neither country nor name. That which had been so
                  dishonored he would abjure, and in the character of an avenger seek the world over
                  till he found the author of his humiliation and wretchedness, and exact a fearful
                  penalty for the wrong he had inflicted on him.
               Friends gathered around them so soon as the tragical incident of the day became
                  known, for Mrs. Rudolph was beloved and respected by all who knew her, and many
                  wept when they saw her consigned to her last repose. But no voice dared to speak of consolation to the stern
                  man of marble who bore the head of her coffin to the grave, performing with his
                  own hands this last service of love for her. The hollow sound of the mould as it
                  fell within the aperture, was, to him, the knell of all tender and gentle
                  emotions; till the stern vow he had taken was fulfilled, his life had no other
                  object; and he turned away from that lowly grave as a stranger and an alien in the
                  land of his birth.
               His story would be blazoned abroad, and those who knew him must learn the burning
                  degradation that had fallen upon him; he could never again endure the
                  companionship of his brother officers; the war was virtually ended, and he would
                  at once resign his commission in the American army, and go upon his dreary quest.
                  Such was Rudolph's final resolution, and he wrote to the commander-in-chief as
                  soon as he arrived at that decision.
               His father had sunk into a state of apathy which resembled imbecility, and, in his
                  desolation, he turned to the son whose presence was most familiar to him. Rudolph
                  felt that he was not necessary to him, and in spite of his brother's affectionate
                  remonstrances, he steadily made his arrangements to leave the homestead as soon as
                  possible. He relinquished his interest in the farm for a few hundred dollars which
                  had been hoarded by his parents from year to year, and after an affecting parting
                  from his relatives, set out to seek such future fortune as Fate might have in
                  store for him.
               Rudolph remembered what Alina had said concerning the informality of their
                  marriage, and he concluded that she and De Vere would seek that point where they
                  could most readily find a priest to unite them. In a large town they would be
                  freer from observation than in a village—that town must be a seaport, to afford
                  facilities for embarkation, and he at once came to the conclusion that Baltimore
                  was the place selected. There he might chance to find them yet, and thither he
                  would go without delay.
               But before bidding adieu forever to his native land, he must once more seek his
                  old friends—Col. Calvert and his daughter. He recalled that last interview with
                  Dora, and bitterly felt how different his fate might have been if he could have
                  returned her love. Destiny had willed otherwise, and now he sought her to bid her,
                  as he believed, an eternal farewell.
               Rudolph rode rapidly forward till he reached the domain around Calvert Hall; then,
                  checking his steed, he paced leisurely through the well remembered road,
                  endeavoring to calm his mind for the approaching interview. It was a lovely
                  evening, and the bright sun, the odor of the late flowers, recalled that day of
                  welcome on which so gratifying an ovation had been prepared for him on that
                  spot.
               As he drew near the hall he saw two figures in the summer house, which he at once
                  recognised as those of Colonel Calvert and his daughter. The veteran reclined in a
                  large chair, and Dora sat at his feet, reading aloud to him. The sound of her
                  voice was wafted to Rudolph, and it awoke a thousand tender and bitter memories,
                  that swelled his heart almost to bursting.
               The tramp of his horse aroused the reader, and she raised her head with a half
                  startled expression which rapidly changed to one of surprise and joyful
                  welcome.
               "Oh, father, here comes our old friend, Major Rudolph! But he seems sadly changed;
                  even at the distance he is from us, I can see his mournful air and stern
                  expression. What can have happened to him?"
               "My child, I forgot to tell you that I have heard of his mother's death. She died
                  very suddenly, I believe; and there are also some strange rumors about his wife.
                  Be very careful how you allude to her."
               
               His wife! the word could bring a pang to Dora even yet, and in her
                  heart she said:
               "I thought so; such a woman as Alina Derval could never make a true man
                  happy."
               By this time Rudolph had thrown himself from his horse, and was rapidly
                  approaching the summer-house. Dora arose, advanced a few paces to meet him, and
                  offered him her hand with the frankness of former days. Her clear eyes looked into
                  his, and he saw there only the friendly expression of a sister. She said:
               "Welcome, after your long absence. We have hoped you would not again visit the
                  Glen without seeking your oldest and best friends."
               He pressed her hand to his lips, but could, at that instant, make no other reply,
                  for his long repressed emotions threatened to master him in the presence of those
                  who, he knew, would so deeply sympathize with him. He passed rapidly on, to take
                  the outstretched hand of Colonel Calvert, whose infirmities prevented him from
                  rising, for his failing health had now settled in confirmed paralysis of the lower
                  limbs. He said, with emotion:
               "My brave boy, I am happy that you have sought us once more. How much I have
                  yearned to see you, to talk over with you your gallant exploits, I will not say.
                  We have followed you throughout your career with deep interest, and it has been a
                  proud thought to me, that I first saw and appreciated your talents for the
                  profession in which you have gained such merited distinction."
               "Thanks, dear and valued friend; your praise is grateful to me, and I need
                  something just now to sweeten the bitter draught of life. I have come to bid you
                  adieu before leaving my native land forever; a few more weeks, and those who have
                  known me will know me no more, for I shall be as one dead to them."
               "The listeners looked at each other in appalled silence. What could have happened
                  to bring him to such a decision as this? They looked on his set features, and saw
                  that he was fearfully in earnest. Colonel Calvert pressed his hand, and said:
               "This must not be, Rudolph, for your country still needs you. Such a man as you
                  are cannot be dispensed with just now."
               "Peace must now soon be declared; I have performed the measure of my service to
                  the land of my birth, and circumstances have arisen which render further
                  continuance here distasteful to me. I shall seek another sphere, and—and, God
                  alone can see what my future lot is to be."
               "But you will lose the reward of all you have done. Your services entitle you to
                  brilliant distinction, and, with your talents, in the new order of things that
                  must arise, you can play an important part. Speak not of going from us, I conjure
                  you, as you value your own fame."
               "I value nothing now," he gloomily replied. "The more lofty the height to which I
                  might aspire, the more blighting would be the stain that is upon me. No—I must
                  seek a new path—leave behind me every association with the bitter past; even the
                  name I have borne will sound no longer in the ears of men, for it is my fixed
                  purpose to abjure it forever."
               Col. Calvert grasped his hand, and tears streamed over his worn face as he looked
                  into that of the speaker, and read there the evidences of the tornado that had
                  passed over him, uprooting in its path all that was dear and precious to him.
                  After a long and painful pause, he said:
               "This resolution must have a terrible cause. A man does not lightly relinquish the
                  fruits of years of toil and struggle."
               "Yes—a terrible cause you may well say. I stand before you blighted in my manhood—cast down from
                  the height I have striven to gain by the hand of her I trusted. You will hear the
                  story, but not from my lips. I cannot speak of her, nor of her treachery; I can
                  only feel it in every throb of my heart, in every quivering nerve of my
                  frame!"
               He bent down his stately head, and the first tears he had shed since that fatal
                  morning came to his eyes. He sternly dashed them away, and stood before them the
                  image of grief too deep for words to console, and they felt that the iron had
                  indeed "entered into his soul." Dora timidly approached him, and softly said:
               "My friend, my brother, you are respected by all men. You have done great deeds,
                  let not this bitter sorrow unfit you for the duties of life. Your home is here; no
                  taint can cling to you through the perfidy of another. Listen to the voice of
                  friendship, and abjure this wild plan."
               "Oh Dora—Dora!" passionately replied Rudolph, "had we only met before this baleful
                  woman crossed my path, I should have been saved from this degradation; but a cruel
                  spell was upon me, from which I could not escape. I delivered myself over to the
                  Delilah who has shorn me of all that is dear to man, and in my desolation I come
                  to ask of you and your father that kind remembrance—those prayers, which the
                  blighted wanderer will sadly need. Ask me not to stay in this land, for here is
                  death to my pride—disgrace to the unsullied name I inherited from my father."
               He uttered this outburst in a voice of such thrilling anguish, that Dora had no
                  words to reply. After a long silence, Col. Calvert said:
               "Your resolution is then irrevocable?"
               "As irrevocable as the decree of Fate itself," was the stern reply. "All that can
                  be said to dissuade me from my purpose has already been uttered, and without
                  effect. I have parted from my poor old father, from my only brother, for the last
                  time, but I could not go away forever without looking once more upon the true
                  friends I have made for myself. It was due to Dora, and yourself, that I should
                  express to you all the gratitude I feel for your past kindness, and I have made my
                  last pilgrimage to this spot, to clasp hands with you before I depart upon my
                  lonely way. I will spend the night beneath your roof, but with the dawn I must
                  depart."
               "And when you have found a new abiding place, will you not also furnish us with a
                  clue to your future fate? We shall watch with solicitude for anything that can
                  throw a light on your career."
               Rudolph seemed plunged in gloomy thought; after a few moments, he said:
               "If the cloud that now encompasses me ever again breaks into light, I will send
                  you a token that it is so. If you hear nothing from me, conclude that my life has
                  set in darkness and storm. Such is most probably its ultimate destiny."
               "Then we will hope for a better day for you. Such souls as yours were not created
                  for a common destiny, and God takes care of his own. You will make Fate itself
                  bend before you, and yet win the recognition due to a great and highly endowed
                  soul."
               "Yes," said Dora, fervently, "I feel that it will be so."
               "I thank you, my dear friends, and trust that your kind prophecies may meet
                  fulfilment; but it will be a long and bitter struggle before I can again feel that
                  the prizes of life are worth contending for."
               If anything could have consoled Rudolph in his present state of wretchedness, the
                  tender words of these valued friends would have acted as balm to his wounds; but
                  he was not yet in a state to be soothed into peace. He had but one burning desire; to meet the author of his
                  sufferings as man to man, and mete out to him the reward of his villainy. That
                  once accomplished, he could turn his perturbed thoughts to new purposes in life;
                  though he now believed that for him hope had sung her last syren song, and the
                  triumphs he might win could never bring happiness to his wrung and tortured
                  soul.
               The three sat together till a late hour of the night, and with the dawn Rudolph
                  departed; but he gave no hint to Colonel Calvert that he was in pursuit of De
                  Vere. After the first painful outburst of feeling, he alluded no more to Alina;
                  and his friends hoped, what they wished to believe, that he would permit her to go
                  unmolested upon the disgraceful path she had chosen.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE AVENGER ON THE TRACK.
               DE VERE and Alina reached Baltimore in safety on the third day after their
                  departure from the Glen. He was well acquainted with the town, and easily obtained
                  lodgings in a retired street, with a widow who had apartments to let. His first
                  care was to find a priest who would be accommodating enough to perform the service
                  he wished, without making too strict inquiries into the antecedents of the pair he
                  was to unite.
               There was a small Catholic chapel in the environs of the city, under the care of a
                  priest who was known to profess the strictest tenets of the faith to which he
                  belonged. He regarded the baptisms and marriages performed by the clergy of the
                  dissenting churches as absolutely null and void, and unhesitatingly proclaimed his
                  uncompromising belief that out of the pale of the one and indivisible church there
                  is no salvation—no authority to bind or loose.
               To him De Vere went, and procured the service he required. The bans were published
                  in this out-of-the-way place on three consecutive days, and on the evening of the
                  third De Vere and Alina stood before the little altar and ratified their vows. To
                  him it was a moment of intense happiness; to her one of triumph and joy. She cast
                  from her all thoughts of the forsaken Rudolph, and revelled in the anticipation of
                  the brilliant future about to open before her.
               So soon as they could obtain passage for England they intended to embark, but in
                  such uncertain times there was much difficulty in speedily doing this; especially
                  as De Vere would not leave until he could find a vessel whose captain could give
                  him a private cabin into which no other person was to intrude. In addition to
                  this, exposure to the cool night air on the night of her flight, and, perhaps,
                  some faint feeling of remorse for the misery she must have left behind her, threw
                  Alina into a low fever, which hung around her from day to day to day, threatening
                  to deprive her of strength to endure a sea voyage at that stormy season of the
                  year.
               De Vere watched over her with the utmost solicitude, and anxious as he was to get
                  away, he suffered no token of impatience to escape him. He thought Alina more
                  adorable than ever, and felt that he would have risked death a thousand times
                  sooner than have missed the happiness their union afforded him. To him she was
                  gentle and confiding, and she endeavored in every act of her life to show him how
                  truly she was devoted to him.
               De Vere took every precaution against discovery, and he never went out without a
                  disguise that must have baffled his
                  most intimate friend. He wrote to New York to have his letters forwarded to him
                  under cover to the priest, and one day he received quite a bulky package from him,
                  which had been sent from England by Mrs. Fitzhugh. It contained a few lines from
                  that lady addressed to himself, in which she conjured him not to seek Alina as he
                  valued her happiness, though she had sent to him important documents for her,
                  which she requested him to find means to forward to her without delay.
               With a curling lip Alina read the affectionate advice her aunt addressed to
                  herself, with which was mingled details concerning her own affairs and those of
                  Helen. For these she cared very little, but the last page afforded matter of much
                  deeper interest.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh went on to say:
               
                  "Your uncle, Count Armand Derval, is dead, and after ignoring your existence
                     throughout his life, he has actually named you as heiress to all the property
                     he left behind him. It is not a brilliant fortune, for Count Derval derived his
                     chief means of living from the place he held at court; but to you and Rudolph
                     it will be a handsome independence when its value is transferred to the land in
                     which your destiny is fixed. I congratulate you, my dear niece, on this
                     bequest, as it will enable you to aid your noble husband in rising to the
                     position such a man should fill. The documents forwarded to me from France are
                     in my possession, but I send you duplicates of them, that you may see the
                     extent and nature of your new possessions. I believe that a voyage to Europe
                     will be necessary to enable your husband to claim your fortune, and I trust you
                     will be his companion, and thus we may once more meet."
               
               While Alina read these lines, De Vere was employed in examining the papers, and he
                  laughed as he looked up and said:
               "This is not so bad a windfall, Alina. Your uncle has bequeathed you a hundred and
                  fifty thousand francs, securely invested; and all you have to do will be to prove
                  your identity, and take possession of your inheritance. There will be no
                  difficulty in that, but it involves a change in our plans. There is a vessel here
                  loading with tobacco for Havre: I was on board of her yesterday, and was half
                  tempted to engage a neat cabin then; but my desire to go directly to England
                  prevented me from doing so. Now it seems necessary to visit France first; what do
                  you say to going on her? do you think you are strong enough to venture on the
                  voyage?"
               "Oh, yes, I am much better, and the news seems to have given me new life. Engage
                  our passage by all means, and let us leave as soon as possible. We have already
                  been too long detained here, and at times, I have fearful misgivings for your
                  safety. It seems to me that our happiness is too great to last, and I dread a
                  meeting between you and——"
               She did not dare to pronounce the name that trembled on her lips.
               "Dear love," he tenderly replied, "do not conjure up phantoms with which to scare
                  yourself. The man you fear will not seek us out. He knows that your heart is
                  utterly alienated from him: that you could never be induced to return to him;
                  then, wherefore should he attempt to follow us? He belongs to a utilitarian
                  people, who do not profess to cultivate the code of chivalry; and he has not
                  sprung from that class which seeks atonement for injury in blood. In spite of his
                  former bravado, I feel quite safe, I assure you."
               Alina felt this to be a false estimate of Rudolph's character, but she was willing
                  to have her fears allayed, and she
                  listened to his words with the faint hope that they might prove true.
               To get away from America, to seek a new and wider sphere, was the strongest wish
                  of her soul, and she rallied all her strength for the effort necessary to a speedy
                  departure. A maid was found for her in the person of the widow of an Irish
                  soldier, who was anxious to return to Europe, and De Vere engaged the cabin on the
                  Walrus in the name of Captain Lyon, as he intended to preserve his incognito till
                  he was landed on a foreign soil.
               He learned from the captain that the principal portion of the cargo was owned by a
                  gentleman who intended to go out with him as supercargo. He spoke of Mr. Michel as
                  a singular and reserved man, who seldom spoke except on business; a small cabin
                  built on deck was to be appropriated to his use; and as Captain Lyon and his wife
                  desired complete privacy, there was little danger of this unsocial being
                  attempting to interfere with them in any way.
               No other passengers were to be received, and as the ship was staunch and well
                  built, besides being an excellent sailer, they might anticipate a speedy and
                  prosperous voyge. De Vere expressed his hope that it might prove so, as his wife
                  was not strong enough to bear a prolonged or boisterous trip across the Atlantic;
                  and mutually pleased with each other, the two parted.
               The season was unusually warm; the tropical storms were over, and although it was
                  now late in December, they hoped for pleasant weather while on shipboard. With a
                  feeling of light hearted gaiety, in which she had hitherto scarcely dared to
                  indulge, Alina made her final preparation for departure, hoping that they were
                  escaping from the danger into the very jaws of which they were ignorantly
                  thrusting themselves.
               Could she have dreamed who that silent and dejected supercargo really was, how
                  would she have recoiled from the thought of crossing his path. On his arrival in
                  Baltimore, Rudolph laid aside his uniform, and donned a garb suited to the
                  position he had now assumed. He diligently sought for De Vere throughout the city,
                  and more than once they had met upon the streets, without any suspicion on the
                  part of either that his most deadly foe was passing before him. The change which
                  the lapse of time had made in Rudolph accounted for this, and the disguise of De
                  Vere was too well sustained to be penetrated. He had also permitted his beard to
                  grow, and changed his voice as perfectly as his garments concealed his
                  identity.
               After weeks of vigilant search, believing his quest hopeless, Rudolph concluded
                  that his enemy had already embarked for England, and as an opportunity offered
                  itself to increase his slender means by embarking in a speculation in tobacco, he
                  invested nearly the whole of his capital in that article. He dropped his last
                  name, and one letter from his baptismal one, and as Mr. Michel, assumed the office
                  of supercargo on board the Walrus.
               He was too wretched and restless to form any settled plans for the future; after
                  placing his business in good train in Havre, it was his fixed purpose to go in
                  search of Sir Lionel De Vere, and pursue him, if he fled before him, even to the
                  uttermost parts of the earth. His vengeance accomplished, he would then seek
                  military employment under some foreign power, for he knew that all his talent lay
                  in that line, and he must win fame upon the battle field, or die without
                  distinction.
               Twilight had fallen when the new passengers came on board, and took possession of
                  their cabin. At dawn the vessel was to sail, and the supercargo did not intend to
                  embark until the last moment. Alina was soon established in her new quarters, and
                  everything that could contribute to the
                  comfort of the voyage was lavishly provided by De Vere. They were to have their
                  meals served in their own cabin by their servants; and as the man who attended on
                  De Vere was perfectly prudent and trustworthy, the travelers felt as if they had
                  at last gained a haven of safety.
               With the dawn of day the preparations for departure reached their ears, and soon
                  the motion of the ship assured them that they had forever left the land from which
                  they so ardently desired to escape. It was a joyful moment, and they congratulated
                  each other with lively pleasure that present danger was avoided, and the means of
                  evading future ones in their possession.
               The ship gained the sea, and for several days both De Vere and his companion
                  suffered much from illness, but this passed away, and Alina declared herself
                  benefitted by the transient sickness. Her spirits revived with every mile they
                  gained, and she was soon well enough to resume her usual occupations. De Vere read
                  aloud to her; he devoted himself entirely to her, and each passing hour seemed to
                  strengthen the bond that bound them together. Alina taught herself to believe that
                  it was indestructible, and De Vere had no misgivings on the subject.
               Possessing no strong religious faith, he was fully imbued with the most ultra
                  dogmas of the church in which he had been educated, and he looked upon Alina as
                  legally his own. Such vengeance as Rudolph might seek to gain would surely not
                  take the form of a prosecution for bigamy against her, and for
                  everything else he believed himself prepared.
               That the avenger was upon his very steps, breathing the same air he breathed, he
                  never once dreamed, or his feeling of security would have been sadly damped.
               During the early part of the vogage the weather had proved cold and squally, and
                  there was no temptation to venture on deck, though De Vere occasionally promenaded
                  there for exercise.
               On these occasions he had remarked a figure muffled in an immense pea jacket
                  crouching in the bow of the ship, with his hat drawn over his brows, and an
                  expression of listless dejection in his whole figure which betrayed a history of
                  wretchedness and disgust of life, but De Vere instinctively avoided him. He did
                  not possess sufficient benevolence to interest himself in a forlorn stranger, and
                  he contented himself with speculating on the causes of his evident depression,
                  inwardly contrasting his own fate with that of this unhappy man, and
                  congratulating himself that he had gained all that he believed necessary to his
                  perfect happiness.
               The Walrus at length entered the Gulf stream; the atmosphere changed, and the soft
                  airs of the tropics superceded the chilling breezes that had hitherto wafted them
                  onward. Under their influence Alina revived, and her cheek bloomed with renewed
                  health. She would not be persuaded to venture on deck by daylight, but at night
                  she consented to go up a few moments to watch the effect of the full moon, rising
                  as if from the ocean.
               Well wrapped up, with a thick veil shrouding her features, she walked for half an
                  hour, speaking in low tones to her companion. But on this occasion, and on several
                  others, the figure of the dejected man of whom De Vere had spoken was not visible.
                  He was in his own cabin, writing, as they imperfectly saw as they passed his
                  window. The bent figure, dimly outlined, with his hat slouched over his brow,
                  revealed nothing to Alina, though a cold thrill pervaded her frame as she passed
                  his door. On the last evening she shivered so perceptibly, that De Vere hurried
                  her below lest she should take cold.
               Alina did not again go on deck for many nights—a feeling of dread for which she
                  could not account had taken possession of her, but at length they drew near the
                     coast of France, and the captain
                  announced that in twenty-four hours they would be in the port of Havre. His
                  passengers heard it with delight, and that evening Alina proposed to promenade
                  once more on deck before they reached their destination.
               "It is chilly," De Vere said, "and you had better wrap yourself up more warmly
                  than the last time."
               She drew out the heavy shawl she had worn from the Glen, and a peculiar odor was
                  diffused through the cabin. De Vere commented on it, and said:
               "I never smelled on any other a perfume like that you use—I believe I will
                  christen it bouquet D' Alina."
               "And with good cause," she replied, with a laugh; "for it is of my own
                  composition. I have a luxurious fondness for sweet odors, and I compound this
                  myself by mixing several extracts together. Thus I have an original perfume which
                  no one can imitate."
               "It is delicious; the Sultan would give you the finest diamond in his collection
                  for the secret of its preparation. The Turks, you know, are connoisseurs in such
                  things."
               On what trifling things fate often hangs, was never more perfectly illustrated
                  than in this accidental choice of a shawl saturated with the subtle and peculiar
                  odor which she alone knew how to prepare.
               They ascended to the deck, secure and happy, to meet their Fate upon their way. In
                  his usual place crouched the dark form of the melancholy supercargo, and as the
                  two silently flitted past him, he started, clutched a coil of rope that lay beside
                  him, and seemed panting for breath.
               The odor so familiar to him in the brief days of his happiness; which he had so
                  often and so delightedly inhaled; which was so indelibly associated with his false
                  love, was wafted toward him as she passed. He stifled the cry that arose to his
                  lips, quelled the rapid pulsation of his heart, and eagerly watched for her
                  return.
               Why had he not at once recognised the carriage of that queenly head?—the footfall,
                  that once was sweetest music to his heart? for now, with his senses all alive,
                  Rudolph knew that he could not be mistaken. Alina was before him, and the
                  mysterious passengers who had so constantly secluded themselves, were Sir Lionel
                  De Vere and his own guilty wife.
               He suffered them to pass and repass without interruption, for he was deciding in
                  his own mind the surest plan to carrry out his vengeance. Fate had given his foe
                  into his own hands, and now he should never evade him. Their account must be
                  settled before land was reached, and one or the other, perhaps both, fall in the
                  combat he intended to seek.
               Rudolph did not move till the two retired below; he knew that De Vere would again
                  return, for of late he always walked the deck till ten o'clock, and now it was
                  scarcely eight. He arose as they disappeared, staggered forward, and, after a few
                  moments, went steadily toward the captain's state-room. He found him examining a
                  chart, and he looked up with an expression of startled surprise as his eyes fell
                  on the pale face and flashing eyes of the strange supercargo. "Is anything the
                  matter, Mr. Michel? you look very ill and wild."
               Rudolph steadied his voice, and replied
               "I am not at all ill; but I have been startled by a strange apparition. Who are
                  those people that you have on board? Under what name do they travel?"
               "Under their own, I presume. There is no mystery about them that I know of.
                  Captain Lyon is returning to Europe with his wife; she has been ill, and he
                  devotes all his time to her. A more attached couple I never saw, and she is one of
                  the prettiest creatures I ever looked on."
               "Yet she is the wife of another man, from whom she has eloped. I saw her on deck
                  to-night and I knew her."
               
               "You seem strangely moved, sir; but granting this to be true, what interest have
                  we in it? The husband must right himself."
               "Such is his intention, and I am he."
               Captain Weston stared at him as if he thought him mad. He asked:
               "Who then are you? and by what chance have these people thrown themselves into the
                  very lion's jaws?"
               "You see before you one who has abjured name, home, country; an outcast from hope,
                  from love, from all the sweet charities of life, has that man made me.
                     Why fate threw us together is clear to me; that I may avenge my
                  outraged honor in the only way now left to me. Sit down, Captain Weston, and
                  listen to my story, for this night you must be my witness that the duel I am about
                  to engage in was conducted fairly."
               In silent bewilderment the captain obeyed, moved as much by curiosity to penetrate
                  the reserve of his unhappy passenger as by interest in the parties concerned. In
                  few, but graphic and burning words, Rudolph placed him in possession of the facts,
                  and appealed to him to decide if any other course was left to him but to challenge
                  De Vere at once, and settle without delay the difficulty between them. After a
                  long pause, he reluctantly said:
               "It was a wretched chance that brought you both together here. Who would think
                  that lovely woman could be such a double-dyed deceiver? Yet it makes my heart ache
                  to think of the poor thing, if you should kill her lover. It will break her
                  heart."
               "She has no heart to break," was the stern response. "She has given death to my
                  mother, wretchedness to me, and now I will repay her as she merits. All I ask of
                  you is, to see fair play between that man and myself. If I fall, bury my body in
                  the sea, and take what I have as a reward for the service. If he falls, let her do
                  with him as she sees fit; to me she is henceforth nothing."
               The captain would have remonstrated, but Rudolph would not listen to him. He
                  said:
               "My cabin is large enough for such a combat as this will be, and I can light it up
                  sufficiently for my purpose. I have my pistols with me; you shall load and examine
                  them yourself, for you must act as second to both of us."
               With firm tread he led the way to his cabin, followed by the startled captain, who
                  would have given much to see his way clearly out of the affair; but Rudolph's
                  energy and determination bore all before it. He produced the pistols, lighted the
                  lamps, and removed the few articles of furniture to one side. It was a long narrow
                  room, but far short of the space usually placed between combatants in a duel.
                  Captain Weston said:
               "If you are both marksmen, in this narrow space it will be a double murder.
                  Neither will have a chance to escape."
               "It matters not. In affairs of this nature, men often fight with only the width of
                  a table between them. I waive that: Sir Lionel De Vere may have such chance for
                  his life as the length of this room affords him. But, if there is justice in
                  Heaven or on earth, I shall surely kill him."
               "Then it is your fixed purpose to take his life?"
               "Assuredly—or to give my own. The earth is not wide enough to hold me and the man
                  who has so basely injured me. Draw the load, and prepare the pistols for a new
                  charge, while I seek my enemy."
               He went out, closing the door behind himself, and the captain proceeded most
                  reluctantly to perform the duty assigned him. He could think of no means of
                  preventing this deadly rencounter; and, in truth, his own sympathies were with the
                  wronged husband to whose story he had so lately listened. He was a man of nerve,
                  but his hands trembled as they took up
                  the weapons so soon to deal death from their dark tubes.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE DUEL AND ITS RESULTS.
               THE night was clear, and starlit, though low in the horizon a few faint clouds
                  were gathering, heralds of a coming storm, which the Walrus might chance to evade
                  by getting into port before it burst.
               As Rudolph anticipated, De Vere had returned to resume his walk, and the sound of
                  his steps smote upon the ear of the enemy before his eyes became sufficiently
                  accustomed to the faint light to discern his figure. Suddenly they ceased, and
                  Rudolph paused a moment to ascertain his exact position before approaching him.
                  Pressing his hand over his eyes to steady his vision, when he again looked forth
                  he saw the dark outline of De Vere's form leaning over the bulwark, apparently
                  watching the flashing waves through which the ship cut her rapid way.
               As the panther leaps on its prey, Rudolph bounded forward, touched him upon the
                  arm, and said:
               "Sir Lionel De Vere, I wish to have a few words with you in private. Come with me,
                  if you please."
               The shock of hearing his name called, deprived De Vere, for an instant, of all
                  self-command; but he quickly recovered himself, and haughtily said:
               "I have no business with you, sir, and my name is Lyon."
               "Liar! wretch! scoundrel! you shall not evade me thus!" was hissed through the
                  teeth of the enraged man who addressed him. "Come with me this instant, and render
                  the account due for all your baseness, or I will strike you down before me."
               The appalling truth had not yet dawned on De Vere; he thought Rudolph a madman,
                  and believed it best to humor his fantasy; therefore he replied:
               "Whither shall I go? Can we not as well settle this matter here?"
               "No, not here—not alone, and in darkness, lest others should say the survivor had
                  dealt unfairly in the combat to which I challenge you."
               "But, my good sir, I have no cause of quarrel with you. What hallucination leads
                  you to seek me out as an object of vengeance?"
               "Hallucination do you call it? Know that against me you have
                  committed the deadliest wrong that one man can be guilty of toward another, and I
                  demand the only atonement known to the code of honor—your life."
               A cold dew broke out on the brow of the listener, and he hoarsely asked:
               "Who then are you?"
               "I am Michael Rudolph."
               The words rang out over the darkened waters with fearful distinctness, and for an
                  instant De Vere shuddered through every nerve of his frame; but he was not a
                  coward, and instantly recovering his self-possession, he replied:
               "I know not what perverse fate has thus brought us together, but if you insist
                  that I shall fight you for taking under my protection a woman who has never loved
                  you, I will not refuse. Let us settle this affair without delay."
               "Such is my intention; follow me."
               "Let me go down for my pistols."
               "There is no need that you shall do that. Captain Weston, who will be our witness,
                  is preparing mine for our use. If you
                  decline using them, he can send your servant for yours; but you comprehend that
                  perfect secresy is best for the affair we have in hand."
               "It matters not to me," De Vere indifferently replied. "I am master of the weapon,
                  and I shall certainly kill you."
               "And I as certainly believe that God has given your life into my
                  hands, as an atonement for the bitter wrong you have done me."
               He strode away, followed by De Vere, who by this time had recovered from the shock
                  of his sudden revelation, and was as eager for the combat as Rudolph could be. He
                  fully intended to rid himself of him forever, and then Alina would be surely his.
                  He believed the fury and agitation of his adversary would render his hand too
                  unsteady seriously to endanger his own life, and he felt assured that the firmness
                  of his nerves would give him the victory.
               They entered the lighted cabin, and with a sneering smile, De Vere beheld the
                  preparations which had been made for his reception. Captain Weston would again
                  have remonstrated, but neither party would listen to him. De Vere waved his hand,
                  and said:
               "It is useless, Captain. This gentleman and myself are of one mind; the feud
                  between us must come to this arbitration, and it is as well settled here as
                  elsewhere."
               He then took the captain aside, and whispered to him a few directions with
                  reference to her whom the event of the next few minutes might leave without a
                  protector. Weston promised all that was required of him, and after examining the
                  pistols, De Vere carelessly said:
               "They are such as I usually use. Let us finish this scene as speedily as may
                  be."
               "I am ready," replied Rudolph, with stern composure, and the two were placed by
                  Captain Weston in the centre of the cabin, from which they were to pace toward the
                  extremities of the narrow limits assigned them, wheel, and fire
                  simultaneously.
               The low wail of the rising wind, the dash of the sullen waves as the ship rushed
                  onward, mingled with the solemn tread of these men—one, or both of whom, was
                  doomed to destruction within the next moment of time.
               They reached the boundary—the fatal word was given—and in the same instant both
                  pistols were discharged. There was a faint cry, a heavy fall, and when the smoke
                  cleared away, the captain wiped from his eyes the blinding mist which had gathered
                  in them, and looked to see the result.
               De Vere lay upon the floor, his upturned face fixed in the immobility of death,
                  and Rudolph leaned against the wall with his hand pressed over his left side, as
                  if staunching the flow of blood from a wound.
               "It is all over with him, poor fellow," said the captain, pointing to the
                  recumbent form. "How is it with you, comrade?"
               "I am wounded, but not severely. He aimed at my heart—but He who knew my cause was
                  just, protected me. I felt that it must end thus."
               He took off his coat, bared his side, and exposed a flesh wound: the ball had
                  merely grazed the skin, and passing through his clothing, was found buried in the
                  wall beyond.
               "God be praised that one escaped, for I thought you both surely doomed to
                  destruction."
               "I was certain that his life was given to me. Yet I care very little for that
                  which has been spared to me. All that I valued he wrested from me,
                  and I have repaid him. One more duty remains to me—I must once more see the woman
                  who has been the cause of this, and with my own lips tell her what I have
                  done."
               In vain the captain combatted this resolution. In that hour of relentless feeling Rudolph would not forego
                  his purpose.
               They raised De Vere's body, and examined it, to be sure that life was extinct. A
                  small stream of blood issued from a wound in his breast, and they saw that the
                  bullet had penetrated his heart, causing instant death. Already his limbs were
                  stiffening into marble rigidity, and on his features the vindictive purpose with
                  which he had accepted the combat was stamped with vivid power.
               They wrapped him in the cloak he had thrown aside, and placed his stark form upon
                  the berth. The captain dressed Rudolph's wound, and resuming his coat, he
                  said:
               "And now the last act of the tragedy approaches. I must once more stand face to
                  face with the evil genius of my life, and return to her lips the dregs of the cup
                  she has prepared for me. It is just, and I will not forego my vengeance on the
                  false heart that has made me an outcast and a murderer."
               "Spare her this," entreated the captain. "She is a woman:—she loved him, and she
                  will surely suffer enough when she knows all."
               "A woman! well, yes—she is a daughter of the sphinx, and as hard as the granite of
                  which her mother is made: otherwise she could never have been guilty of what she
                  has done. She has ambition, pride and self-love, but no gentle or true humanity.
                  She shall feel the event of this hour in every pulse of her being, and mine alone
                  shall be the voice to announce it to her. Stay here and watch, I ask you, until I
                  can send De Vere's servant to relieve you. I shall not be long gone, for such a
                  mission as mine is soon accomplished."
               He went out, closed the door carefully behind him, and threaded his way toward the
                  staircase that led to Alina's cabin. He descended lightly, tapped upon the door,
                  and without waiting for a reply, opened it and entered.
               Alina was alone, and she sat with her back to the door, gazing through the window
                  with apprehension on the increasing evidences of storm, which was now rapidly
                  rising. Without turning her head, she said:
               "You have stayed very long, dearest. I am afraid we are going to have dreadful
                  weather. I would not undress when I saw the storm rising, but sent Betty to bed,
                  and sat up for you."
               No answer came, and she arose, dropped the shawl that enveloped her form, and
                  turned toward him with some light words of endearment upon her lips. Rudolph had
                  advanced to the centre of the cabin, and the glare from a swinging lamp fell full
                  upon his bared head and pale features. Had the fabulous Gorgon appeared before
                  her, she could not have seemed more suddenly frozen into stone than she appeared
                  to be at this unexpected apparition. She stood rooted to the spot, motionless,
                  voiceless, with lips half apart, and eyes staring as if some spirit from the
                  regions of the dead had been suddenly evoked before her.
               The sound of Rudolph's voice broke the benumbing spell.
               "Alina, I am here, and my very presence in this cabin, should tell you all. The
                  doom I have foretold has fallen upon me. The stain of blood is upon me, and
                     you have placed it there."
               She sprang toward him, clutched his arm fiercely, and in low, husky tones,
                  whispered:
               "You have not dared? You have not killed him? No, no—you could not—could not be so
                  cruel in your vengeance."
               "Cruel? Do you think that any feeling of humanity is left in my outraged heart?
                  Yes—De Vere lies cold, and stark—insensible to your love, to your blandishments;
                  and mine was the hand that gave him his doom. I swore to take his life, and thus I have avenged the
                  destruction of my mother—the desertion of my wife. Who shall judge me? Not you,
                  fallen and degraded one; not you, false and perjured woman; for on your soul lies
                  the sin and misery of this wretched hour."
               "Then De Vere is dead," said Alina, in the same monotonous whisper.
                     "Dead!—dead!—dead! Now hear me, Michael Rudolph," and
                  her voice rose suddenly to a piercing cry—" I loved him alone; I loathed your very
                  presence, even in the first days of our marriage, when I forced myself to put on
                  the semblance of affection. I but wedded you to escape dependence on those who
                  cared little for me, for I thought myself deserted by my true love. This I told
                  you long ago; I begged for a release from the vows I rashly plighted, but you
                  refused it, under the plea of duty. When I was forced to dwell in the obscure and
                  humble home of your parents, I again deceived you into believing that my heart had
                  turned toward you; but it was only to escape from the dreary life I led; and
                  almost in the hour I succeeded, my lover came to me, offering me a brilliant
                  future; love, happiness, and also the station of a wife—for the tie that bound me
                  to you he did not recognize as valid, for it was unsanctioned by the only true
                  church. I fled with him; I married him. Aye, married him; and you
                  have followed me up—have wrested from me all that I value in existence; and I
                  swear to pursue you to the last hour of your life. I will become the curse of your
                  life."
               She sank back, exhausted, despairing, but still tearless; for the anguish
                  struggling in her heart was too deep for the relief of tears.
               Rudolph sternly replied:
               "You cannot curse my life more deeply than you already have done, but it shall not
                  always be thus. I loathe, and shrink from you as much as I once loved you; I have
                  wiped out the disgrace you put upon me, and in a new country, under another name,
                  I will seek and find that distinction and happiness of which you have deprived me
                  in my own. Farewell forever, Alina; in this hour we part for the last time."
               "Not so," she passionately rejoined. "I will find you—will strike you again, and
                  again, till I, in my turn, shall accomplish my vengeance. I swear undying enmity
                  to you. Guard yourself as you may, conceal yourself under a false name, and I will
                  still track you as the sleuth hound find its prey. Go—leave me to my woe, for you
                  have stricken the only being to whom I clung on earth."
               "Yes," he gloomily replied, "the fatal deed is accomplished, and your life is
                  rendered as desolate as my own. This is mete punishment for you; but I would have
                  spared you, had you permitted it. You have wrought out your own destiny, and I
                  have only been the instrument of Fate. Farewell, most false and perfidious of
                  women; seek to repent of the evil you have done, that your destiny in the life to
                  come may not be as dark as that you have given yourself in this."
               Rudolph turned away, and left her alone.
               For a few moments Alina sat stunned and overwhelmed by the sudden blow that had
                  fallen upon her. She bitterly lamented the tragical fate of De Vere; but, even at
                  that moment, she thought more of her own position, than of the untimely doom her
                  fatal love had brought him. As his widow, she dared not claim recognition; for she
                  well knew that the laws of Protestant England would not sanction the sophistry
                  with which they had sought to delude themselves into the belief of the validity of
                  their union.
               Fierce and bitter resentment toward the author of her misery, mingled with the
                  grief she felt for the loss of him to whom such love as she was capable of feeling
                  had been given. She caused the corpse
                  of her lover to be brought into her cabin, and beside it she solemnly renewed her
                  vow of vengeance against his destroyer. She kept watch beside him with tearless
                  eyes and motionless features. De Vere's valet, who was much attached to him, was
                  more demonstrative in his sorrow than she was, and she sent him away that his
                  grief should not disturb her. She also dismissed her maid, who came shivering and
                  crying from her bed when the man awoke her and told her what had happened. Alina
                  wished to be alone, that she might brood over and mark out the course she would
                  pursue in future.
               The storm without continued to increase in violence, and soon the cries from the
                  deck, the fearful pitching of the vessel, showed her that they were in imminent
                  danger. Captain Weston, accompanied by De Vere's servant, came in to perform the
                  sad service which they knew would be required; and his motionless form was
                  securely lashed to the berth in which it had been placed. He entreated the pale
                  watcher to take refreshment, which he had brought into her; but she motioned it
                  imperiously away, and then he sat down beside her, and told her all that had
                  occurred between the two combatants. He assured her that the duel had been fair,
                  and no advantage had been taken of her lover; that he had pledged himself to De
                  Vere to protect her till he would place her in the care of the friends to whom she
                  was going. Alina listened passively, and when he finished speaking she drearily
                  said:
               "I have no friends; he was all I claimed, and he has been snatched from me by
                  violence. But I shall find those who will aid me to fulfil the purpose of my life;
                  yes—I shall surely find them. Leave me now; I cannot bear the sound of a human
                  voice—the sight of a living face in this hour of supreme wretchedness."
               Again she was alone with her dead; but no softness, no penitence came to her heart
                  for the doom she had brought him. She only thought with vindictive bitterness of
                  the hand that had accomplished it, and she registered her vow to become the
                  Nemesis of his fate.
               The storm continued to increase in violence, the ship was driven from her course,
                  and surged through the billows with that heavy swash which proved that she had
                  become unmanageable. Just before dawn, the mainmast fell with a crash which caused
                  those on board to believe that all was lost; but the wreck was cut away, and again
                  the staunch vessel righted, and ploughed her rudderless course through the surging
                  waters that leaped and roared against her sides as if eager to engulf her as their
                  prey.
               Day dawned amid black and threatening clouds that portended no abatement in the
                  strife of the elements; and the boldest seamen on board looked out on the raging
                  waters with fear and dismay in their hearts. As the day advanced, the tragical
                  event of the preceding night was whispered among the crew, and with the well-known
                  superstition of sailors concerning the presence of a dead body upon a vessel, they
                  declared that there would be no abatement in the storm till the corpse was
                  removed.
               The captain evaded them as long as possible, but when a second morning dawned and
                  the gale still continued, he no longer refused to listen to them. It was
                  impossible to keep the body of De Vere any longer, and as a sailor, he regarded a
                  burial in the deep as far preferable to the narrow house assigned to the dead on
                  land.
               He anticipated much difficulty with Alina, but to his surprise she offered little
                  opposition to his removal. The living form of her lover had been important to her,
                  but of his dead body others were at liberty to dispose as seemed best to them,
                  especially as this funeral at sea would relieve her from a sad and perplexing
                  duty.
               
               She had no desire to betray to the new world into which she was about to enter,
                  the position she had held toward De Vere, and with quiet apathy she saw him
                  removed from her sight.
               Alina declined being present at the service which the captain read on deck; and
                  sewed up in a hammock, with a cannon ball at his head and feet, all that remained
                  of Sir Lionel De Vere was cast into the vexed waters, which greedily opened to
                  receive him, and like a flash he sank to the depths of old ocean, one of the
                  myriads who have found their last home in the deep.
               As if to justify the superstition of the sailors, the storm sensibly abated within
                  the next few hours, and by mid-day a lurid sun shone through the parting clouds.
                  An observation was taken, and the ship was found to have drifted to the coast for
                  which they were bound. A jury mast was rigged up, sails set, and her head turned
                  on her proper course.
               Before the dawn of the following day, the port lights of Havre were seen in the
                  distance, and by sunrise the Walrus lay alongside of the wharf, ready to discharge
                  her cargo.
               Alina found a large sum of money in De Vere's dressing case, and from this she
                  paid the two servants liberally, exacting from them a promise of secresy as to the
                  actual cause of her lover's death and the relation she had sustained toward him.
                  The valet intended to proceed at once to England, and she charged him with a
                  letter to her aunt, in which she requested her to join her without delay in Paris,
                  as through Mrs. Fitzhugh alone could she be identified as the heiress of Count
                  Derval. She deferred till they met the explanation of the causes that brought her
                  to France without her husband.
               Betty, the maid, she retained with her, as she would need an attendant, and the
                  simple-hearted creature seemed to have formed an attachment for her during the
                  voyage.
               Rudolph did not again appear before her, and, in obedience to her wishes, Captain
                  Weston made arrangements for removing her at once to Paris. The valet was to
                  travel post with her, and after placing her in suitable lodgings, he was to pursue
                  his own way to England. The morning after the arrival of the Walrus, the Havre
                  papers contained the following announcement:
               
                  "Died on board the American ship Walrus, on her passage out, Sir Lionel De
                     Vere, a young English baronet, who had served several years in the British army
                     in the United States. He was the representative of an ancient name, and the
                     heir to a large fortune, but death found him in the flower of his manhood.
                        Requiescat in pace."
               
               Captain Weston was unwilling that any judicial investigation should be made into
                  the affair which had occurred on his ship, and before landing, he called the crew
                  together, and stated to them that sufficient cause for the duel had arisen between
                  his two passengers; that he had recognized its necessity so far as to act as
                  second for both parties. The combat had been conducted with due regard to all the
                  laws of single combat, and the survivor was justly accountable to no man for the
                  part he had taken in righting wrongs that could not be passed over. He insisted
                  that nothing concerning it should be reported when they reached Havre, and the
                  sailors, who had noted the dejection of the unhappy Rudolph, were unwilling to
                  annoy him in any way. They readily pledged themselves not to speak of the event,
                  and thus he was enabled to transact his business without the notoriety and
                  vexations that must have attended any judicial investigation of the affair.
               For this he was thankful, and in the constant employment of the next few weeks,
                  his over-burdened mind found some respite from the corroding griefs that rankled
                     there. Rudolph had some knowledge of
                  colloquial French, caught from the officers of that nation who had been his
                  companions in arms, but he knew nothing of its literature; and although in time,
                  to all outward seeming, he became a Frenchman; though he refused in after years to
                  communicate with his countrymen in his own language, lest they might suspect his
                  origin, he never acquired that perfect control of his new tongue which could
                  enable him to express himself with that precision and force that was his
                  birthright. He could still be energetic, but not elegant.
               He saw Alina depart without an attempt to see her, for he felt that she was, as he
                  had said, nothing to him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               TREASURING UP WRATH.
               
                  
                     
                        "Thy lot is appointed, go follow its 'hest,
                        Thy journey's begun, thou must move, and not rest;
                        For sorrow and care cannot alter thy case,
                        And running, not raging, will win thee the race."
                     
                  
               
               WHEN Waldron, the valet of De Vere, reached London, he sought out Mrs. Fitzhugh
                  without delay, and delivered the letter with which Alina had entrusted him.
                  Knowing how impossible it would be to conceal from her aunt what had occurred,
                  Alina had tacitly permitted him to violate his pledge of secrecy with reference to
                  her, as it would save herself the necessity of breaking to her, when they met, the
                  painful events of the last few months.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen were at breakfast when a letter, deeply bordered and
                  sealed with black, was brought up. Helen had grown into a graceful and
                  elegant-looking girl, with an expression of ingenuous sweetness and candor that
                  was extremely captivating. Her last term at school was just completed, and she had
                  returned only the evening before to the protection of her mother, to remain with
                  her till the hand that was already plighted could be claimed by her betrothed.
               "Who can be dead that we know?" asked Helen, apprehensively, as she glanced toward
                  the letter. "I hope nothing has happened to Reginald; but I am a little goose to
                  think of such a thing when he left me in perfect health not twenty-four hours
                  ago."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh glanced at the superscription, and changed color, for she recognized
                  the writing of Alina.
               "It is from your cousin, and I am afraid that some very painful affliction has
                  befallen her. I fear her husband is dead."
               "That would not be considered an irreparable misfortune by her, I am
                  afraid; but perhaps I judge her too harshly. What does she say, mamma? Poor Alina!
                  I have deeply repented of what I did against her, but Heaven knows, I would have
                  repaired my wrong if she would only have listened to me."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh read the few lines Alina had sent her, in bewildered alarm, and the
                  change in her countenance communicated her feeling to her young companion.
               "What is it, mother, dear? What does Alina say to make you grow so pale?"
               Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter, clasped her hands, and bent down her head in
                  silent perturbation. Helen snatched up the paper, and read these words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I am in Paris, widowed in heart, and alone. Come to me
                                 yourself, that you may enable me to claim the
                              inheritance left me by my uncle. Waldron will tell you of the tragedy
                              that occurred on the ship on which I came out; but for your own sake,
                              and that of Helen, you will keep it to yourself.
                           
                           "The wrong my cousin perpetrated against me has wrought out its
                              legitimate consequences, for I believe that I have been more 'sinned
                              against than sinning.' Lose no time in joining me, as it is important
                              to have my claims settled as soon as possible.
                           
                              ALINA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Oh, mother, mother, what does she mean? what can she mean?" asked Helen, in
                  consternation. "De Vere did not go to the United States? He could not have been so
                  mad."
               "He did go, in spite of all I could say to dissuade him from such a step. I
                  concealed it from you, because it could do no good to tell you. The bearer of this
                  letter must come up, that I may learn all he has to tell. It will be a painful
                  story, my child, and you had better spare yourself the sorrow of hearing it."
               "I must eventually learn its details, mother, and you can trust me not to reveal
                  the misconduct of my cousin. I owe her that much as reparation, for I feel that I
                  have indeed sinned against her."
               "Since you will hear it, ring the bell, and conceal yourself behind the folds of
                  yonder curtain. The man might hesitate to speak freely before you."
               Helen rapidly obeyed her, and in compliance with Mrs. Fitzhugh's orders, in a few
                  moments a respectable-looking man in deep mourning entered the room. Her emotion
                  almost overpowered her as she rapidly said:
               "You are Sir Lionel De Vere's valet; this letter refers me to you for some painful
                  details. What has happened to your master? Nothing serious, I trust."
               "Alas! madam, the most fatal thing that could befall him; Sir Lionel is dead."
               A faint stifled cry came from the spot on which Helen was concealed, and Waldron
                  turned in that direction.
               "Madam, what I am permitted to say to you must be spoken in private, as Lady De
                  Vere requested that to you alone I should reveal the events of the last few
                  weeks."
               "Lady De Vere! I am not interested in any person who can legally bear that name.
                  This letter is from my late husband's niece, and she was already a wife. You may
                  speak freely, for the person behind that curtain is as deeply interested in her as
                  I am."
               "Sir Lionel, madam, and the lady who bears his name, did not recognize the
                  validity of her first marriage, and their first act, after she fled with him, was
                  to be united by a priest. To that marriage I was a witness, and they were both
                  satisfied that it was a true one."
               "Then De Vere sought Alina, and she proved untrue to her wedded vows. Oh, I feared
                  this! I feared this. And Rudolph? what of him? Tell me in as few words as
                  possible, for I am tortured by this suspense."
               "Sir Lionel assumed a false name, and took every precaution to evade Major
                  Rudolph; but by a most unfortunate chance, they took passage on the same ship. He
                  was known on board as Mr. Michel, and both had changed so much since they last met
                  that neither recognized the other. They might have ended the voyage without coming
                  in collision, but Major Rudolph saw his wife and knew her. He sought Sir Lionel,
                  challenged him to deadly combat, and in the duel that followed my master lost his
                  life. He was buried at sea, and the affair was so managed that no inquiry was made
                  when we reached Havre. I took my lady to Paris, established her there, and came on
                  to bring the news of Sir Lionel's decease to his brother."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh listened to these details in deep perturbation. She asked:
               "And Rudolph is also in France? What was his purpose in going there?"
               "The cargo on the ship belonged principally to him, and I believe he intends to embark in trade in France.
                  He has abjured his name and country, and no doubt he will soon manage so as to
                  leave no clue to his former friends by which he can be traced."
               "And this disgraceful story—what is to be done to conceal it? Mrs. Rudolph must be
                  aware that, under English laws, she can never establish her claim as the widow of
                  Sir Lionel De Vere."
               "I do not think she has any such intention, madam. She desires to reside in
                  France; to you, and to the brother of my late master, these facts must be made
                  known; but beyond that I am pledged to secresy. I am now on my way to Vere Castle,
                  and I only stopped in town to deliver the letter with which I was entrusted."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh continued to question him till all the minutiæ of what had occurred
                  on the Walrus was known to her as far as Waldron himself was acquainted with the
                  details. She then dismissed him, and Helen came forth wringing her hands in
                  impotent despair.
               "Oh, mother, I have been the cause of all this misery. I am self-condemned and
                  wretched. But for my fatal interference, De Vere would now have been living. Alina
                  would have been his lawful wife, and the evil that is in her might have lain
                  dormant amid the life of prosperity he could have ensured her."
               "It might have been so, Helen; but I am afraid that your cousin is not a good
                  woman, and I am sadly conscious that my instructions developed the seeds of evil
                  in her nature in place of eradicating them. I begin now to see my error, and
                  repent of it. Reason and nature are not the only gods to which humanity should
                  bow. Yet, if there had been one spark of true divinity in Alina, the noble man to
                  whom she plighted her faith would have developed it; but she wilfully deceived,
                  and then deserted him. Do not blame yourself too severely, my love; for, even as
                  the wife of De Vere, I believe, after the first glamour of passion was past, that
                  she would have rendered him miserable."
               "Oh, mother! what will Reginald say when he hears this fatal story? He will blame
                  me as the real cause of his brother's tragical fate; for I will not conceal from
                  him any portion of my guilt."
               "Conceal nothing from him, Helen, that, as your betrothed husband, he has a right
                  to know. Reignald will pardon everything to you, if he loves you as he
                  should."
               "And Alina? She will hate me more fervently than ever, when she knows that I am to
                  take the position she was anxious to attain as mistress of Vere Castle. Oh! I now
                  wish that Reginald and I had never met, never loved each other; for it seems cruel
                  to build my own happiness on the downfall of hopes I have been instrumental in
                  crushing."
               "My dear Helen, your self-condemnation is too excessive, though I love you better
                  for this sensibility. Alina will never forgive you, I can well believe; but
                  blessed in the love of Reginald, your sphere will be so widely severed from hers
                  that you need never meet. As your husband, Reginald will be more lenient toward
                  her, and he may possibly admit her claims on his late brother so far as to allow
                  her an annuity from the estate. The splendors and pleasures of life are more to
                  Alina than anything else, and she will soon be consoled if the heir is liberal
                  toward her."
               "But nothing can restore the life which has been sacrificed; for that I must ever
                  feel remorse."
               "Sir Lionel risked the consequences, with a full knowledge of what might result
                  from his elopement with Alina. He is at rest; let masses be said for the repose of
                  his soul, and you can perform such penance as your confessor may deem necessary.
                  By this event, unfortunate as it is, Reginald is placed at once in a position to
                  claim your promised hand, and so soon
                  as the first mourning for his brother is over, he will, doubtless, wish your union
                  to take place. Cheer up, my darling, for you had no thought of evil against De
                  Vere when you withheld his letter to your cousin. You believed that you were
                  serving him, and an error of judgment in a child is not to be too harshly
                  censured."
               "But I am afraid I was instigated by a feeling of revenge against her, as much as
                  by the wish to save Sir Lionel from a marriage that could have brought him only
                  unhappiness."
               "He accomplished that union at last, and death has only saved him from awakening
                  from his fond delusion; from as great misery as poor Rudolph is now enduring. Let
                  not all our sympathy be given to the erring dead, when the wronged man who yet
                  lives has so heavy a burden to bear."
               "And I permitted him to clasp her hand in a marriage which I knew could be no true
                  one. Oh! mother, I must ever bow my head in humiliation for this rash deed, and I
                  feel that I shall be punished for it more bitterly than I have yet been."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh used all her art to console her; but Helen wept unceasingly while
                  she was preparing to set out on her journey to Paris. The young girl did not ask
                  to accompany her mother, for she knew that her presence would only be an
                  irritation to her cousin, and she also shrank from again meeting Alina.
               On the arrival of Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen in England, Reginald De Vere was
                  residing in chambers, in London, preparing himself for his chosen career as a
                  lawyer. He called on the widow of his brother's friend, saw Helen, and was greatly
                  struck with her frank and open character, as well as charmed by her peculiar
                  beauty, which consisted more in mobility, and vivacity of expression, than in
                  regularity of features. He soon became a constant visitor, and during the
                  vacations, which Helen spent with her mother, he had many opportunities of seeing
                  her. Each interview deepened the impression she had made upon his heart, and on
                  her side a strong attachment also grew up, which ended in their betrothal.
               From the large estate inherited by his brother, Reginald had only a younger son's
                  portion—a few thousand pounds, the income from which was a bare support. He
                  watched with much interest for Sir Lionel's return, in the hope that he would
                  place him in such a position as would enable him to marry as soon as Helen left
                  her school.
               Now, there was no impediment to their speedy union, but Helen had in her heart no
                  room for exultation at the brilliant prospects that opened before her, gained as
                  they had been by a fault of her own, which was so bitterly repented.
               When her mother left her alone, she sat down at once, and wrote to her lover. With
                  perfect frankness, she related all that had occurred, and made no effort to
                  palliate the mistaken course she had pursued. She appealed to him as her judge,
                  and declared herself ready to abide by his decision, whether it condemned her to
                  perpetual exile from himself, or recalled her to his heart in the forgiveness of
                  perfect love.
               
                  "I have merited punishment," she concluded, "and if it comes from your beloved
                     hand, I must bow my head in humble submission. I have meddled with the fate of
                     others in a most unjustifiable manner, and the tragic result to all parties
                     concerned, has taught me that God alone is the director of human destiny. This
                     bitter lesson has been sent, to show me how impotent are our feeble efforts to
                     guard or guide those we love from the perils that threaten them. I would have
                     saved my dear friend from a marriage
                     that I believed would bring him only wretchedness, and in so doing, I have
                     given him over to death. Oh, Reginald! pity and forgive me, for my heart is
                     breaking with the remorse that fills it."
               
               Four days must elapse before an answer could arrive, and Helen spent them in a
                  wretched state of suspense and dread.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh, accompanied only by a trusty courier, set out for Paris that
                  evening, after again placing Helen under the charge of the principal of the school
                  she had so lately left. She had the address of Alina, and without any incident
                  worth recording, she reached her lodgings in one of the principal streets of
                  Paris.
               She was conducted through a wide hall, and a light tap upon a door was answered by
                  Betty, who invited her to enter a darkened room hung with funeral drapery. If the
                  inward woe corresponded with the outward semblance that met her eyes, the visitor
                  felt that it must be deep indeed; but she could not avoid thinking that the "grief
                  which passeth show," does not thus ostentatiously parade its trappings before
                  others.
               As her eyes became accustomed to the gloom, she saw a figure reclining in a large
                  chair; a white hand was put forth from the shrouding crape that enveloped it, and
                  after a burst of emotion, Alina spoke in French, with a bitter and hard
                  intonation:
               "You have come, madam, to witness and condemn the working out of your own
                  precepts. Remember that you taught me that I was a free creature,
                  accountable only to myself, and the Reason which has been given me, for the use I
                  make of my life. Therefore, I am not prepared to listen to censure, much as you
                  may feel disposed to utter it."
               "Alina, my poor, lost child," faltered her aunt, "I have only compassion in my
                  heart for one so fearfully punished as you have been. If you have sinned, you have
                  also suffered, and I do not place myself in the position of your judge. I came
                  hither only to help and console you. To aid you in establishing yourself in a
                  respectable position, which will enable you to retrieve the past."
               "It is well; if such are your intentions we shall not clash. I am in that state of
                  nervous irritability which unfits one for everything. I can only sit, and dream of
                  what might have been, and contrast it with the sad reality before me. I was the
                     wife of Sir Lionel De Vere, though the unjust law will refuse to
                  recognize me as his widow, and I must conceal my union with the man I loved, and
                  waive my right to that portion of his estate which should be mine. Tell me, do you
                  know Sir Reginald De Vere? Will he utterly ignore my existence, and refuse to do
                  me justice?"
               "I know him well, for he is a constant visitor of ours. He is liberal, and I think
                  may be influenced in your favor, though he will utterly deny your legal right to
                  claim anything from him."
               "Yet, as a true son of Mother Church, he is bound to recognize the validity of my
                  marriage as much as his brother did. Sir Lionel taught me to believe, with
                  himself, that I was free to form new ties."
               "Alina, this is sophistry that might beguile two hearts resolute to accomplish
                  their own wishes at all risks; but in England, if such a claim as yours was
                  seriously put forward, you would render yourself liable to a prosecution for
                  bigamy, for the law there does not recognize the right of an undivorced woman to
                  give her hand in marriage."
               "I fully comprehend that, and I have no such rash intention. I only demand from
                  the present possessor of the estate
                  such a provision as will prove his respect for his brother's memory."
               "It seems strange to me that you insist on this, when your uncle's bequest places
                  you in an independent position."
               "Yes," she bitterly retorted, "my income will find me in bread and clothes,
                  provided I am not too extravagant in the latter; but I am not one to be contented
                  in a mediocre position. My family is noble, my tastes are luxurious, and when I
                  again enter the world, I must do so under such auspices as will enable me to
                  reinstate myself in the brilliant position of which the act of that madman
                  deprived me. I never will forgive him, and I will find means to reach him
                  yet."
               Though a worldly woman herself, Mrs. Fitzhugh was shocked by this discussion in
                  the first hour of their meeting, under such painful and humiliating circumstances.
                  She said:
               "He to whom you allude has surely suffered enough at your hands already; endeavor
                  to atone for the past, Alina, and do not seek to avenge that which your own
                  conduct provoked. Bury the irretrievable past in oblivion, and let the unhappy man
                  who once adoringly loved you go on his way unmolested."
               "His love!" she disdainfully said. "It has been the bane of my life.
                  You have no vital interest in the wretched ending of all my bright visions, or you
                  could not speak thus. I committed a fatal error in giving Rudolph such power over
                  my fate, but even my marriage with him gave him no right to pursue and crush me as
                  he has done. Let him beware, for I will become to him as dire a Nemesis as she of
                  old."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in deep sorrow; after a pause she said:
               "Let us not speak of these things. I came hither to aid you as far as lies in my
                  power, by placing you in a position to claim your inheritance. I have brought with
                  me all the papers that were forwarded to me, and I also have the address of the
                  advocate in whose hands your uncle's will was left."
               "It was fortunate for me that Count Derval made me his heir, for I shudder to
                  think of the destitute position in which I should have found myself placed but for
                  this bequest. De Vere should have provided against it, but we were both too much
                  absorbed in our happiness to dream of its abrupt conclusion in so tragic a
                  manner."
               She appeared greatly depressed, although her words implied so keen an interest in
                  her worldly affairs, that Mrs. Fitzhugh could not resist the belief that Alina
                  regretted the loss of her lover's fortune quite as much as she lamented
                  himself.
               In their subsequent conversations not one emotion of penitence was expressed;
                  throughout all, she considered herself the wronged party, and she could not, or
                  would not, see that her own want of principle had placed her in her present
                  painful position. At times she expressed the most passionate regrets for the loss
                  of her lover, but never failed to recur to the injustice which deprived her of the
                  consideration due to his widow, and to urge on her aunt the necessity of
                  influencing Sir Reginald De Vere in her favor so far as to induce him to grant her
                  a life annuity on his late brother's estate.
               This Mrs. Fitzhugh readily pledged herself to do, though she could promise nothing
                  as to the result of her mediation. Sir Reginald himself must be the sole judge of
                  the consideration due to her claims.
               In expectation of her aunt's arrival, a room, by Alina's orders, had been prepared
                  for her use, and Mrs. Fitzhugh was soon installed in it. She had friends in Paris,
                     who were summoned to her assistance,
                  and everything was placed in train for a speedy settlement of the business that
                  had brought her there.
               In the course of a few weeks Alina was formally recognized as the heiress of the
                  deceased Count Derval, and as no male heir to the title existed, she at once
                  decided on assuming it herself. The property was securely invested, and a small
                  estate in the vicinity of Versailles devolved to her on which was a cottage ornée,
                  which her uncle had used as a bachelor residence when he was not in attendance on
                  the court.
               Alina also found a distant connection in the person of an elderly baroness, who
                  had been the life-long friend of her deceased uncle. Madame L'Estrange was a widow
                  of narrow means and luxurious habits, and she insinuated to her young relation,
                  that the best thing she could do would be to take possession of La Rosière—as the
                  place was called—and accept her as her companion. The baroness was received at
                  court, and she could easily introduce into that magic realm so lovely and graceful
                  a creature as her young kinswoman: her success there might compensate her for the
                  misfortunes of the past.
               Alina eagerly grasped at the suggestions of Madame, to whom she represented
                  herself as the widow of an American officer who had been slain in fighting the
                  battles of his country. Before Mrs. Fitzhugh left her she removed to La Rosière,
                  which was found to be sufficiently spacious for the establishment she could afford
                  to keep. The place was in good order, and the furniture as elegant and expensive
                  as a man of the late Count Derval's luxurious tastes would be likely to
                  select.
               Alina was really charmed with the beauty of her surroundings, and almost forgot
                  her late bitter experiences in the delight of her new possessions, and the
                  agreeable prospects pects that opened before her ambitious and unscrupulous
                  mind.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               BRIDAL PROSPECTS.
               MRS. FITZHUGH was extremely anxious to return to Helen, from whom she had received
                  but two brief notes since they parted. From these she gathered that the young girl
                  was suffering in health, and wretched at not hearing from her lover. She evidently
                  believed that Sir Reginald had cast her off without a word in answer to her
                  appeal; for since he had not deigned to reply to it, his contempt for her conduct
                  must have destroyed his love.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh did not believe such a result possible, for she understood the
                  generous character of the new heir too well to believe that he would desert the
                  girl to whom he was devotedly attached, for an act she had so deeply repented of,
                  so candidly confessed, when it could so easily have been kept from his knowledge.
                  Some accident must have delayed Helen's letter or De Vere's reply, and she
                  earnestly wished to return to her as speedily as possible, to console and sustain
                  her through this trying time.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh felt that she should not leave Alina without informing her of the
                  prospective marriage of her cousin and the heir of Vere Castle; yet she shrank
                  from the task, for she knew that she would feel bitter resentment that the crown
                  which had been snatched from her own brow had fallen on that of Helen. Yet she
                  knew that Alina would more deeply resent being kept in ignorance of the betrothal
                  till it could no longer be concealed from her; therefore she nerved herself for
                  the scene that she felt would ensue.
               
               Mrs. Fitzhugh saw that her niece was rapidly recovering her spirits; that, at
                  moments, she was almost gay. To her light, unimpressionable nature, life seemed
                  almost as fair as in the first days of her innocent youth, and she evidently
                  looked forward to a brilliant career in the new sphere into which fortune had cast
                  her.
               On the evening before her departure, her aunt sought a private interview with
                  Alina, and after some circumlocution, revealed to her the unwelcome news that
                  Helen was the chosen wife of Sir Reginald De Vere. She listened in utter silence,
                  but there was a hysterical swelling in her throat, her hands nervously clutched
                  each other, and a vivid spot of crimson gathered in her cheeks. Her eyes gleamed
                  with an expression of intense anger, and after a bitter struggle, she spoke in a
                  tone of deep and concentrated passion:
               "So—o, after all, Helen, my enemy, my triumphant foe, will bear the name which
                  should have been mine: which but for her baseness would have been
                  legally mine. She will reign as a queen in my place. Oh! Madam, this is adding the
                  last bitter drop to my cup! Could you not have spared me this crowning
                  humiliation, for such I feel it to be."
               "You must soon have learned it, Alina; and I thought it best to speak to you
                  myself before we part. Poor Helen has so truly repented of the wrong she did you,
                  that forgiveness should be accorded to her. She will make every atonement that
                  lies in her power, and through her influence with Sir Reginald, I hope to gain a
                  recognition of the claims you have upon him."
               "I will accept of nothing that is to be won through Helen's intervention," she
                  passionately replied. "I detest her, as the author of all I have suffered. But for
                  her, I should now be honored, and happy; the mistress of a noble home, with the
                  man I loved beside me. He lies in his bloody shroud at the bottom of the sea, and
                  I am here, in comparative poverty and obscurity, while Helen steps into the
                  station I should have occupied. Do you think that I can or will forgive her? Let
                  her repent; it is fitting that she should do so, but if she does not yet find
                  deeper cause of sorrow, I am much mistaken. I do not permit any one to thwart and
                  trample on me with impunity."
               "Alina, am I to understand this as a threat against your cousin? Will you never
                  see that you have made your own path, and my poor Helen, wrong as she acted, is
                  not accountable for what has since occurred? I am afraid that your perceptions of
                  right are so blunted, that you can never behold the truth."
               "If they are, madam, I believe that I am chiefly indebted to your instructions for
                  that perversion. I am what your precepts and my cousin's perfidy have made me. I
                  have no faith in anything save my own will, guided by the subtle intellect which
                  is my best inheritance. They shall work out my purposes, whether dark or bright,
                  and yet place me on a height even above that to which Helen now aspires. Lady De
                  Vere! ha! ha! Let her look to it, for to the bearer of that name, I declare
                  inextinguishable hatred. Her son shall never succeed to the title;
                  no—I swear it."
               "Alina, this is mere raving. I have no fears for Helen, for she will be placed far
                  beyond your reach; and if God gives her children in the marriage she is about to
                  form, they will succeed to their father's inheritance in spite of your evil
                  threats."
               "Ha! you think so?" and a strange expression swept over her face. "Perhaps an
                  obstacle may arise—who knows? But this recrimination is futile. What I will do, I
                  will do, in spite of Fate itself. Congratulate Helen for me, but do not fail to
                  tell her to remember my words to her
                  when we last saw each other. She will recall them; she will know that I have
                  forgotten nothing, and that time, in place of blunting, has only given keener edge
                  to my resentment. There, madam, I believe you have told me all you have to reveal,
                  and I have spoken my true feelings concerning this marriage. Let us part in peace;
                  I have no quarrel against you, though in your heart you are exulting in the
                  thought that your darling is about to deck her brow with the bridal wreath which
                  she falsely, and even cruelly snatched from mine."
               "Oh, Alina! lost! lost! ruined child! You will destroy yourself if you encourage
                  such dark and bitter feelings. To forgive an injury is the divinest instinct
                  implanted by Heaven in the human heart. Alas, my child, do not stifle every gentle
                  and true emotion that arises within you."
               Alina answered with intense scorn:
               "I scarcely expected an appeal to Heaven from your lips, madam. In
                  other days you taught me that a paradise, if attained at all, must be found in the
                  human mind. I have failed to gain that inward peace which is the evidence of its
                  existence; a wild pandemonium wars, at times within my breast, and if it developes
                  evil acts, who shall blame me for following the instincts of my
                  nature? Not you, who first led me to the mountain top, and like the tempter of
                  old, bade me look out upon the fair world, which should be mine if I had the
                  courage to appropriate its best gifts. I have the courage, the skill,
                  and the daring, so you may rejoice in the progress of your pupil."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh gazed on her in appalled silence. Had this, indeed, been the result
                  of her training? As time progressed, as her vision of life enlarged, she had
                  gradually learned the great lesson taught by the divine Lawgiver, and she would
                  have given much to be able to undo what she had done toward destroying faith in
                  His precepts in the mind committed to her guidance. She burst in tears as she
                  said:
               "I am now a believer; an humble Christian, Alina, and I would to God the power to
                  repair the past was mine. I can only pray for you, and seek forgiveness for the
                  evil I have been the means of inculcating. God is powerful; He can accomplish all
                  things, and in His hands I must leave your unhappy fate. Oh, child! do not utterly
                  break my heart by persisting in the wicked course you seem resolved to run."
               "I shall work out the destiny prepared for me," replied Alina, with apathetic
                  calmness. "Quiet your conscience, madam, and leave to me the responsibility of my
                  future acts; I am willing to bear it."
               She arose as she finished speaking, and swept rapidly from the room. Mrs. Fitzhugh
                  sat till twilight gathered around her, absorbed in painful thought, her eyes fixed
                  on the fair scene on which the windows opened, though she was utterly unconscious
                  of the soft beauty of the evening; for spring had come, and budding leaves, and
                  early flowers cast their fragrance over the miniature lawn that lay in front of
                  the cottage.
               With the lights Madame L'Estrange came in, and prattled in her weary ears of the
                  Court, which was soon coming to Versailles, and of the influential position she
                  might gain there if she could only revive some dormant claims to distinction which
                  had once belonged to her family. She was still a handsome, well preserved woman,
                  though verging toward her sixtieth year, skilled in all the finesse of fashionable
                  life, and nothing could have suited her better than the opportunity afforded her
                  of increasing her own importance by becoming the chaperon of so lovely and
                  ambitious a creature as she knew her young relative to be. She felt assured that
                  her protégée would rise above her present level, and her own interests be
                  proportionably benefitted.
               
               Mrs. Fitzhugh began to fear that she was not the best person to be entrusted with
                  such a charge, but she had no power to change the arrangements which had already
                  been made, and with a heavy sigh she finally said:
               "Madame, my niece is a person of strong will and quick temper; to you I leave her
                  guardianship, in the hope that you will guide her aright. You have had much
                  experience in life, and you will know how to teach her to avoid the quicksands in
                  which a young and beautiful woman may be engulfed."
               "Oh, yes, I can do that, and much more," was the vivacious rejoinder. "I will
                  conduct our fair countess to the high places of the earth, and with her charms and
                  talents she may win anything to which she chooses to aspire. When Alina's mourning
                  is over, you will hear of a brilliant début in society."
               "Ah, Madame, only teach her to be a good woman, and I shall be satisfied."
               The French woman stared at her as if she did not exactly comprehend her meaning;
                  she shrugged her shoulders expressively, and said:
               "Ah, oui, oui; of course she must go to mass and
                  do penance for her sins. This is her confessor's affair, and I intend to send her
                  mine. He is a great man, and an elegant gentleman too. Yes, Monseigneur le
                  Cardinal de Rohan is one of the elegantes of the Court. He does not often
                  condescend to act as confessor, but for reasons of his own he attends a few noble
                  ladies. I possess influence in a certain quarter, and he is my very good friend.
                  He admires charming women, and la Comtesse will be sure to win a place among his
                  élêves. Yes, madam, trust your niece to us, for we will do great things for
                  her."
               This was not exactly what Mrs. Fitzhugh meant, but she despaired of giving the
                  frivolous baroness any idea of her real meaning, so she turned away, and in a few
                  moments retired to her own apartment.
               On the following morning she left La Rosière; she had a brief parting interview
                  with Alina, who thanked her for her efforts to serve her, and coldly expressed the
                  hope that they might meet again, though she gave her no invitation to visit her.
                  The thought that her aunt was returning to Helen, to witness her marriage with the
                  heir of Vere Castle, filled her with bitterness. She asked:
               "When will Helen assume her new state?"
               "I cannot tell—but probably not before autumn. She is very young, and there is no
                  need to hurry matters."
               "You will hear from me before that time, and—yet no, it will be time enough when
                  my hopes are realized."
               "I do not understand you, Alina; but it matters very little. Will you not keep up
                  a regular correspondence with me? You speak as if you expected to maintain silence
                  for many months."
               "What will be the use of exchanging letters filled with hypocritical professions
                  of regard? There is little love between us, for all yours is lavished on Helen. I
                  shall not write till I have something of interest to communicate to Sir Reginald
                  De Vere."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh was alarmed. She hastily said:
               "Make no effort to break this marriage, Alina; I beseech you to have more respect
                  for yourself."
               She broke into a mocking laugh.
               "Believe me when I assure you that I have no such intention. Let Helen become Lady
                  De Vere, and find such happiness as she may. I have a presentiment that it will
                  not be much. Good bye; I hope you will get safely to London. Tell my cousin that I
                  shall be sure to send her a bridal present."
               She lightly kissed her aunt, and they parted.
               
               Mrs. Fitzhugh found Helen pale and wretched, suffering both physically and
                  mentally, for the state of her mind had seriously affected her health. She had
                  never received a line from her lover, nor seen him during the tedious six weeks of
                  her mother's absence; and, with the impetuosity of youth she declared her
                  conviction that De Vere had forever relinquished her. That so deep was his disgust
                  for the part she had played that he did not consider her worthy even of a word to
                  soften the bitterness of her lot. She had no one near her in whom she was willing
                  to confide, and the wearing anguish of the last weeks of her life had reduced her
                  to a mere shadow of her former self.
               Her mother at once removed her to her former lodgings, and surrounded her with
                  such tender cares that the poor girl made an effort to smile and listen cheerfully
                  to the words of hope she uttered.
               As the best panacea for this wounded heart, Mrs. Fitzhugh took measures to
                  ascertain where De Vere was, and what had occasioned his mysterious silence. In a
                  few days, she learned that he had gone on a trip to Scotland before the arrival of
                  Waldron at the Castle, but was now expected there in a few days.
               A long delayed letter for Helen, written in the Highlands, arrived, from which she
                  learned that this was one of several sent by De Vere which had failed to reach
                  their destination. He had suddenly left his home to accompany a college friend on
                  a trip to Gretna Green with his runaway bride, and the party was now spending a
                  few weeks in the Highlands with a relative of the groom.
               It was evident that De Vere had never received the last letter of Helen; his
                  silence with reference to it was thus satisfactorily accounted for; but she was
                  still in a state of miserable uncertainty as to the final result of her
                  communication.
               Just as her fears began to communicate themselves to her mother, a scarcely
                  legible scrawl, dated from Vere Castle, was received. He wrote:
               
                  "I have just returned home to hear the wretched tidings of my unhappy brother's
                     guilt and its speedy retribution. Oh! would to God he had not thus died. My
                     poor, poor Lionel! the handsome, the brave, the free-hearted, cut down in the
                     flower of his manhood, and cast into the remorseless deep! If they had brought
                     him back to the home of his fathers, that his ashes might have reposed in peace
                     beside theirs, I could more easily be consoled.
                  "It is a bitter affliction that my brother should have committed this
                     wrong—that he should have died for it; but I must seek for strength to bear it
                     where alone it may be found. Waldron has told me all, and your heart, my Helen,
                     is lacerated with my own. So soon as I can regain composure I will come to
                     town; and your sweet voice, your tender smile, shall bring back peace to my
                     unquiet spirit."
               
               Helen read these words with a beating heart and varying color. Still there was no
                  allusion to her confession. He had evidently never received it, and she was yet in
                  doubt as to her happiness. On the following morning her fears were set at rest by
                  the following missive:
               
                  "My darling Helen, how much you must have suffered while awaiting my reply to
                     the most touching letter that ever man received. I found it hid away among a
                     pile of papers which had been thrown upon the library table, read it with tears
                     gathering in my eyes, and hasten to answer it.
                  "Beautiful spirit of candor and truthfulness, always remain the same, and I
                     shall continue to adore you as long as life is granted me. You committed a
                     great wrong, but you were too young
                     to comprehend the results that might flow from it. You loved him who has gone
                     from among us, and it was for his sake you risked so much. Forgive you, my
                     sweet love? I have nothing to forgive, and you must permit no morbid feeling of
                     remorse to weigh upon your heart. On the two actors in this sad drama the
                     accountability rests, not on you.
                  "I will come to you as soon as possible, but there are many claims on my
                     attention here, and I cannot escape for a week to come. At the end of that
                     time, expect to see me, for I yearn for a sight of your sweet face, for the
                     music of your beloved voice."
               
               Helen wept tears of heartfelt thankfulness over these precious lines; she read
                  them again and again, and seemed as one endued with new life. For the first time
                  for many days, she arose from her sofa, robed herself in the light mourning she
                  had ordered to be prepared, and looked into her glass, to see how it became her;
                  for Reginald was coming, and she wished to be charming in his eyes.
               The pale cheeks and hollow eyes that met her gaze showed how deeply she had lately
                  suffered, but she thought: "When he comes I shall bloom again, for he is the sun
                  of my life, and by this change he will see that without him I should die."
               At the appointed time De Vere arrived, but in the interim, Helen had almost
                  recovered her freshness, and only in her tearful eyes and grateful smile could the
                  history of the painful struggle through which she had passed be read.
               Sir Reginald was very unlike his brother in appearance. His form was taller, and
                  more robust; and his brown hair, blue eyes, and serene expression revealed a man
                  of an entirely different stamp. Sir Lionel had been passionate, wilful, and
                  haughty. Reginald was thoughtful, tender, and upright. He bore his mother's nature
                  within him, while the elder brother had been a true representative of the dark and
                  proud De Veres, who, for ages, had borne down all opposition by the iron hand of
                  power.
               In this first interview with Helen, he did not allude to their speedy marriage;
                  for to a man of his delicate sensibility, it would have seemed like snatching the
                  flower of happiness from the grave of his brother. Lionel's death had given him
                  the power to claim his betrothed, but a suitable period must elapse before bridal
                  rejoicings could replace the mourning due to one he had tenderly loved.
               De Vere had a long interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, in which she related to him,
                  without reserve, the whole history of Alina, as far as it was known to herself.
                  She alluded with reserve to her niece's expectations with regard to a provision
                  from the estate, for it pained her, that Alina should have so pertinaciously
                  insisted that she should make them known to the heir. With that delicacy which was
                  a marked feature in his character, the young baronet spared her all further
                  embarrassment by saying:
               "I have already settled this matter, my dear madam. The woman who was dear to my
                  brother, must be remembered by me, although headlong passion hurried her into the
                  step which led to such grievous consequences. Lionel was the party most to blame,
                  for he sought her out, and for the wrong he has done in tearing her from her home
                  and country, I must repay her as far lies in my power. I have already settled upon
                  her an annuity of five hundred pounds, which will be annually paid by my bankers.
                  You can inform your niece of this arrangement, at your earliest convenience, and
                  tell her to draw on Messrs. Rodrigness, Hortaling & Co. for the amount. I had
                  rather not write to her myself."
               "There is no need that you should do so," replied Mrs. Fitzhugh, hastily, for she was by no means willing
                  that any communication should be opened between Alina and the betrothed husband of
                  Helen. She had a vague dread that if such a thing occurred, her niece would
                  endeavor to undermine, and, in time, destroy the happiness of one she so bitterly
                  detested.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh wrote immediately to Alina, informing her of the liberality of De
                  Vere, and to this letter she replied in the following brief terms:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I received your letter; and I shall draw on the bankers for the
                              pitiful sum allowed me from an income of twenty thousand pounds, which
                              would never have been Sir Reginald De Vere's, if he, who was my true
                              husband, had lived. A liberal man would have provided for me as his
                              brother's widow, but for the present I accept this pittance. You can
                              say to him what you choose, as I am not thankful for such trifling
                              favors, and I will not express what I do not feel."
                           
                              "ALINA, COMTESSE DERVAL."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Fitzhugh simply informed Sir Reginald that his annuity had been accepted by
                  her niece, and henceforth her name was not mentioned among them. It was arranged
                  that the marriage of the lovers should take place early in the fall, and the happy
                  summer that followed was indeed the summer of Helen's life. A portion of it was
                  spent in a village by the sea side, in the vicinity of Vere Castle, and Sir
                  Reginald daily joined herself and her mother in their rambles and drives through
                  the surrounding country.
               The settlements were preparing, the trousseau had been ordered, and two happy
                  hearts were hourly knit in closer union by the free intercourse which permitted
                  each one to know and appreciate the good traits of the other, happily unconscious
                  of the brooding malice of her who thought of their happiness only to devise means
                  of thwarting it.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh had not delivered Alina's message to Helen, for she did not wish to
                  cast a cloud over the serene tenor of her present life, and she felt assured that
                  the sphere of the future Lady De Vere would be too far removed from her cousin's
                  to permit Alina's evil influence to fall within it.
               Thus the placid hours glided away. Vere Castle was undergoing repairs, and being
                  magnificently furnished for the reception of its new mistress, for Sir Reginald
                  thought nothing too fine or too elegant for his young bride.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               STRANGE VICISSITUDES.
               IN his new career, Rudolph brought all the energy and activity of his mind to bear
                  upon the business he had undertaken. He toiled incessantly to escape from the
                  wearing sense of desolation and loneliness that preyed upon him. Amid new
                  associations, hearing only the sounds of a foreign language around him, at times
                  he felt as if walking in a strange dream, which would flit away and bring to his
                  waking vision the realities he had once so dearly prized. But a sudden pang of
                  memory would effectually arouse him, and all the old anguish he lived over
                  again.
               He no longer loved Alina; a deep and bitter disgust had taken the place of the
                  passion which had filled so large a space in his life; but in crushing it out he
                  seemed to have destroyed the spring of hope. He mechanically pursued his daily
                  avocations; with his natural shrewdness, conducted his business affairs in such a
                  manner as ensured success; and, in the course of a few months, he was well known to the mercantile men in Havre as
                  the foreign tobacco merchant; for it was in that article alone he dealt.
               He was known to them as M. Michel, and although, as yet, he spoke French
                  imperfectly, his fine presence and gentlemanly bearing made so agreeable an
                  impression on those he had dealings with that he was frequently invited to visit
                  their families, with the benevolent hope that he might be drawn out of the
                  depressing gloom that evidently preyed upon his mind.
               But these invitations were invariably declined; for, in his present state of
                  feeling, society was too distasteful to him to be voluntarily sought. By the close
                  of the spring his speculations had secured for him a few thousand dollars; and
                  weary of the distasteful calling he had adopted, which was so foreign to all the
                  former habits of his life, he began to make arrangements for returning to his
                  former profession, though where he should seek service he had not yet
                  determined.
               All his leisure hours were spent in the study of military tactics, and the
                  masterly skill which distinguished him in later years was thus acquired. He was in
                  the habit of spending his only day of rest in the grounds attached to a small
                  cottage situated in the outskirts of the town. In them was a bower which looked
                  toward the sea; and seated on a rustic bench, with his hat drawn over his eyes,
                  poring over his book, or drawing diagrams with his pencil upon the blank leaves,
                  he might be seen every succeeding Sunday.
               There was a narrow winding path, leading from the knoll on which his favorite
                  retreat was placed, to the beach below. This Rudolph frequently descended and
                  walked for hours upon the smooth sands, endeavoring, in rapid motion, to drive
                  away the thronging thoughts that would intrude.
               One evening in early summer he had taken his usual stroll, and was slowly
                  ascending the pathway again, when he became aware, from the sound of voices above,
                  that his retreat had been invaded by strangers in his absence. Unwilling to
                  encounter them in the frame of mind in which he then was, he paused, and looking
                  around found on one side a recess in which he could sit until the new comers had
                  departed.
               Their words were wafted toward him, but he did not heed them till the sound of his
                  assumed name struck upon his ear. It was growing late, and the visitors to the
                  cabaret had mostly departed, or had gathered in the wine shop to take their
                  parting cup. The speakers evidently believed themselves entirely alone, for they
                  spoke without precaution.
               "I say, Pierre, this Michel has returned to town by the beach. What is the use of
                  watching here when the bird has flown?"
               "Because he will certainly return this way. He often walks on the sands till a
                  late hour, and when he comes up the hill, we can deal with him. This is the most
                  convenient spot for the work we have to do, for we can take him to the sea and
                  throw him in, without any one being the wiser."
               Though this was spoken in a rough kind of patois, Rudolph understood it, for he had been thrown much with the
                  working population of the town, in his late business career, and he had rapidly
                  learned their peculiar dialect. A new blow seemed to be struck upon his heart, for
                  he felt that he was pursued at the command of Alina. He recalled her threats, and
                  he knew that from her hand alone could this new danger proceed.
               He sat quite still, and listened keenly for what might follow: the voice of the
                  other assassin warningly said:
               "Hist! do not speak so loud, Jacques; our covey might come up the bank and hear
                  us."
               
               "If he was to, he wouldn't understand us, for he aint been here long enough to
                  learn our lingo. I say, Pierre, this is a precious welcome to give to a brother
                  republican, for this man is an American."
               "Why should we care what he is, provided we get paid for the job we engaged to do.
                  A hundred crowns aint picked up in the street, I reckon, and I've killed too many
                  men to care for the life of this one because he comes from that wild country where
                  savages and negroes live."
               "Parbleu! you talk like a man of sense, and I am
                  a fool. We must ply our trade, or starve."
               "No—any man can earn an honest living if it is his will to do so," said a stern
                  voice, and in another instant the tall figure of Rudolph bounded from the ravine,
                  and stood before them. He held a pistol in each hand, with which he covered the
                  two forms before him, as he coolly said:
               "Stand, and deliver your credentials for the crime you came hither to commit, or I
                  will shoot you down. Make the least motion toward your arms, and I fire, and I am
                  a dead shot."
               "Diable!" muttered Jacques, "I told you not to
                  speak so loud, Pierre, but you must always be prating."
               He then spoke aloud:
               "We are in your power, Monsieur, and call for a truce."
               "Lay your pistols on that bench where I can see them, and then I will talk with
                  you."
               The men obeyed, though they were careful to keep guard over the discarded weapons.
                  Rudolph then uncocked his own pistols and returned them to his pocket; he drew
                  near the men, but kept a vigilant eye upon them, lest they should attempt to use
                  their knives in an unguarded moment. He sternly said:
               "You were seeking me with the most deadly intentions. I overheard your words, and
                  fully comprehended them. I am a stranger in this country, and I do not know why my
                  life should be sought by you. Speak—solve this enigma, for I must understand
                  it."
               Jacques remained obstinately silent, and Pierre assumed the office of
                  spokesman.
               "We were set on by a woman, that's all I know about it. Your own
                  conscience can tell you who, and what, your enemy is. We saw the agent; we get the
                  pay when the deed's done, and there our business with our employer ends."
               "Who then was the agent, and where does she live?"
               "She's an old file that you'll never make anything out of, so I don't
                  mind telling you that she lives in Paris. We were sent here to find you."
               "You speak truly," said Rudolph. "I know too well who set you on; and now, my fine
                  fellows, I have a bargain to make with you in my turn. I could call out and have
                  you arrested, but I forbear on one condition. I will even pay you the same amount
                  of blood money you were to have received on that condition."
               "Name it," said Jacques, "we work for money, and yours is as good as that of any
                  other person."
               "That is well. Return to Paris, and take with you this pocket-book, which your
                  employer will recognize as mine. In it are a hundred crowns, and more. Report your
                  business as accomplished, and claim your pay. For myself, I shall disappear from
                  this place to-morrow, for my arrangements to depart are already completed. I shall
                  leave no clue behind me by which I can be traced, so you need have no fear of
                  betrayal."
               "Ah, mon ami, you are a good fellow, and I am
                  sorry I undertook to kill you; and I'm glad too, for it gives us double pay for
                  not killing you. Hand over the money, comrade, and pass on."
               
               "But you will be sure to leave at once?" said Jacques, suspiciously.
               "A week hence inquire for me here, and no man will be able to tell whither I have
                  gone," coldly replied Rudolph. "Here is the pocket-book; it has memoranda in my
                  own writing which will prove its ownership to her to whom it will be taken. Resume
                  your weapons, and go; I wish to be alone."
               The men obeyed his imperious gesture, and in a few moments disappeared among the
                  trees. Pierre whispered to his companion:
               "I say, Jacques, we are well out of this job, for that fellow would have proved a
                  tough customer. He sprang upon us with the bound of a tiger, and faced us with the
                  courage of a lion. He's been used to command men—I know from the sound of his
                  voice."
               "He commanded you easy enough," was the sneering reply.
               To which Pierre rejoined:
               "I think we were in the same box; but it's no use to quarrel now; we've made a
                  better thing of it than if we had killed him."
               "If he keeps his word; but we should have got the money all the same; for of
                  course we wouldn't have been stupid enough to throw him in the sea without taking
                  all the valuables he had about him."
               "It's as well as it is, for that fellow would have killed one or perhaps both of
                  us. He's got the sinews and the heart of a man, and he wouldn't die easy, I can
                  tell you."
               "Ta, ta," gabbler, that's enough. If he don't keep his word, I'll
                  find means to settle with him yet."
               Rudolph sat down upon the bench they had left, covered his face with his hands,
                  and his strong frame was shaken with the emotions that assailed him. Alina had
                  kept her word! The threats which he believed were wrung from her in a moment of
                  overwhelming suffering had taken a tangible form, and she had actually caused
                  assassins to attempt his life. There was bitter anguish even yet, in the thought
                  that she could be so lost, so fallen from her womanhood. He recalled her as the
                  young, pure girl he had loved so long and well, and tears of agony rained upon his
                  breast. He had believed the past was dead to him, but it rose up now in all its
                  power, and his brief dream of wedded love and confidence came back to torture him
                  anew.
               He mourned for her; he prayed in bitterness of spirit that she might be turned
                  from the evil path on which she had entered; and at length, calmed through
                  exhaustion, he arose, and slowly went back to his lodgings.
               It had been his fixed purpose to give up mercantile life; its details wearied and
                  annoyed him, and he had steadily made his arrangements to leave Havre, and go—he
                  cared not whither. All places were alike to him now; his path lay in the dust and
                  ashes of dead hopes, and it was of little import whither it might lead him. His
                  money had already been transferred to a banking-house in Paris, the head of which
                  had become known to him in Havre; and with a few hundred francs for present
                  expenses, he was ready to plunge into the obscurity which was now his only safety.
                  He did not fear an open enemy, but who could guard himself against the assassin's
                  dagger? His life was of too little value to himself to be constantly guarded, but
                  it might yet be made useful to others, and he would seek a new sphere, in which
                  such talents as he possessed could find a theatre of action.
               On the following morning he settled with his landlady, tied up a change of linen
                  in his handkerchief, and walked away from the town. Accustomed to an active life,
                  he did not slacken his pace for many hours; the shadows cast by the trees upon the road began to lengthen when he
                  at length stopped at a cottage and asked for bread and milk, for which he paid a
                  few sous, and sat down in the yard to satisfy his hunger. The woman who brought
                  them to him eyed him with curiosity, and presently asked:
               "Are you one of the men that's after the leopard that's got loose from his
                  keeper?"
               "I am only a traveler, Dame; but what of this leopard? for if one is loose about
                  here, I must be on my guard."
               "There's been a fair in one of the villages, and there was a show of wild beasts.
                  As they were traveling this way, the leopard, which is a vicious creature, they
                  say, got out of his cage in some way, and made his escape. Two men were here this
                  morning, inquiring about him, and I thought you might be another of 'em."
               "No, I do not belong to the caravan, but I am glad you spoke of this, for I must
                  be prepared for an encounter with the animal, if we should chance to meet."
               "Oh, he'll tear you in pieces. He's a terrible beast I am told; and I've been
                  afraid to come out of my cottage all the morning till you came, for my husband
                  would go to hunt him, in spite of all I could say against it."
               "I should like to join the hunters too. In which direction did they go?"
               The woman pointed to a thick woodland, and said:
               "They thought he might hide himself there, but they've had time enough to scour
                  the whole forest since they went away. You'd better stay here till my husband
                  comes back."
               "Thank you. I am tired with my long walk, and with your permission, I will rest
                  here awhile."
               The woman brought her wheel to the door, and began to spin busily, occasionally
                  casting an anxious eye toward the forest, and pausing in her work to listen for
                  some sounds that might indicate the return of the hunters. At length Rudolph
                  asked:
               "Is there a chateau beyond the woodland?"
               "Oh, yes—and a fine fright Madame St. Angeau will be in, if she hears of this
                  fierce creature being loose, for monsieur is not at home, and she and her little
                  girl are alone with the servants."
               "I fancy they will be sufficient to protect them," said Rudolph, and for half an
                  hour no sound was heard save the monotonous humming of the wheel, and the flax
                  passed rapidly and steadily through the skillful fingers of the spinner. Then a
                  heavy step was heard approaching, the gate opened, and a peasant in a blouse came
                  toward the cottage. He seemed fatigued and disappointed, but he greeted the
                  stranger with the politeness natural to his countrymen.
               "Well, François, have you found the wild beast?" asked his wife.
               "No, we've had our chase for nothing. At last we found some tracks which made the
                  men think he has turned northward. I don't believe he's anywhere about here."
               "And did Madame St. Angeau hear of his being loose?"
               "No, we thought it best not to alarm her by going near the chateau, after we
                  concluded that the creature had taken another course."
               Rudolph here arose, and said:
               "I found your good dame frightened, and remained with her till you came to protect
                  her; but now I must be going on my way. Many thanks for your kindness to the
                  wayfarer;" and touching his hat, he passed out of the little yard, and resumed his
                  journey.
               He presently came to two roads which diverged—one led toward the woodland, the
                  other was the public thoroughfare. Rudolph hesitated an instant, and then, by an
                  impulse he could not resist, he stepped into the umbrageous path that wound toward
                  the chateau of which the woman had spoken.
               The sun, by this time, was sinking in the West, and as he at length came in sight of the old-fashioned
                  building, its level beams were falling in flashes of flame upon the windows. A
                  moat had once girdled it around, but this was now partially filled up and planted
                  with flowers; and the ruins of the ancient drawbridge were covered with moss and
                  creeping plants.
               Beyond this lay a broad esplanade shaded by large chestnut trees, beneath which a
                  group was gathered that instantly rivetted his attention. A young woman, of
                  pleasing appearance, sat on a low seat reading, and a child nestled to her side,
                  her dark curls floating over her mother's white robe. A girl in the dress of a
                  peasant sat near them, busy with her needle. The lady must be Madame St. Angeau,
                  but why he came there, or what impelled him to linger near that spot, the wanderer
                  could not have explained. Perhaps it was some lurking fear that the danger of
                  which she was so unconscious, was not past, and he hesitated as to the propriety
                  of leaving his covert, and informing her of the possible vicinity of the
                  formidable animal that was known to be roaming at large.
               The scene before him seemed like a dream of Arcadia. The sylvan beauty of the
                  landscape, the young mother, with her hand toying with the tresses of her child as
                  she read, and the sweet peace that rested on her features, had an inexpressible
                  charm for the shipwrecked man who looked upon her. A soothing calm seemed to fall
                  upon his heart as he sat behind his screen of leaves, and watched the group.
               His eye and ear were very quick, from his long practice in partisan warfare; and
                  Rudolph had remained thus but a few moments, when a motion among the leaves of the
                  tree a few yards from that under which Madame St. Angeau sat, attracted his
                  attention. He soon distinguished a dark, lithe form, whose brown fur was mottled
                  with white spots, stealthily creeping forward, and making ready for a spring on
                  those below.
               Rudolph knew that he had come in time to do battle with the leopard, but his
                  presence of mind did not desert him. He knew that on his skill and courage the
                  life of at least one of those before him depended; and he firmly grasped one of
                  his pistols, and placed the other where he could grasp it without an instant's
                  delay. He then crept forward that he might be near enough to render his aim
                  unerring.
               Suddenly the girl discovered the animal—uttered a loud cry and started to fly.
                  Madame St. Angeau arose precipitately, saw the armed stranger, who at that moment
                  showed himself, and she thought he was the cause of the servants' alarm. She
                  attempted to retreat, but by this time the child had caught sight of the leopard
                  poising himself to spring upon her, and she fell back in a paroxysm of helpless
                  fright, entangling her mother's dress in such a manner that she found it
                  impossible to escape.
               Rudolph never removed his eyes from the animal, but held himself in readiness to
                  act at the right moment; but as the creature sprang toward his intended prey, the
                  crack of his pistol was heard. The ball penetrated the breast of the monster, and
                  he fell a few feet short of his mark; but he instantly arose, and turned with
                  foaming mouth and glaring eyes upon his assailant. Rudolph dropped the discharged
                  weapon, and grasped the other. Coolly taking aim at the inflamed eye of the
                  furious creature, he waited till he was within a few feet of him, and then fired
                  both barrels rapidly into his brain.
               With a wild howl, the leopard rolled over at his feet, dead; and cool, as if
                  nothing unusual had occurred, Rudolph went forward, lifted the insensible child he
                  had so opportunely saved from a fearful death, and carried her into the house, followed by her mother, who could
                  not find words with which to thank him for the inestimable service he had rendered
                  her.
               Many moments passed in restoring the little girl to consciousness, and on opening
                  her eyes, her first movement was to stretch forth her arms to the stranger who had
                  saved her, and bury her head in his bosom. Inexpressibly touched by this impulsive
                  action, Rudolph clasped her to his heart, and uttered every soothing epithet he
                  could think of.
               "Ah, Monsieur," said the tearful mother, "my little Aglaë never before caressed a
                  stranger. She usually shrinks from them, but her grateful heart recognizes you as
                  her deliverer. I cannot thank you as I should, for language is inadequate to
                  express my emotions."
               "Madame, the embrace of this little innocent repays me for all. I feel that the
                  blessing of God has returned to me in permitting me to rescue this child from so
                  terrible a fate."
               Rudolph had labored, under competent instructors, to gain such command of the
                  French language as to speak it with ease, and his quick ear had enabled him by
                  this time to acquire such a pronunciation as identified him with the people among
                  whom he had cast his lot. Madame St Angeau had no suspicion that he was not a
                  countryman, and she saw from his bearing and manner that he was a gentleman. She
                  said:
               "Heaven sent you to our rescue, Monsieur; for had not you come at the critical
                  moment, I shudder to think what might have happened."
               "I truly believe that Providence guided me hither, for I was impelled to come by a
                  presentiment that my presence would be necessary. I stopped at a cottage on the
                  other side of the woodland, and heard there of the escape of the leopard. Your
                  husband's absence, and the possibility that the animal had taken refuge in your
                  grounds, was also spoken of, and when I came to the point from which the roads
                  diverge, I felt that I must come here at least to warn you of the vicinity of the
                  danger. I had scarcely reached the edge of your lawn, when I discovered the
                  creature I have slain making ready for a spring upon your child. The rest you
                  know."
               "Ah, you are a brave and cool man. You have faced danger before to-day, or you
                  could never have been so prompt in your action. My husband will return to-night,
                  and you must remain here till he can thank you with his own lips for the great
                  service you have rendered us."
               Rudolph frankly replied:
               "I am a wanderer upon the face of the earth, Madame, and it is long since the calm
                  sense of peace has visited my heart. This evening when I looked upon the scene of
                  quiet happiness your lawn presented, I felt as if here rest might be found for the
                  storm-tossed stranger. But fate calls me to a far different sphere, and I must go
                  upon my appointed path."
               "But not until you have seen M. St. Angeau. It grows late; twilight is already
                  gathering, and my husband will never forgive me if I permit the rescuer of our
                  child to leave his roof without partaking of our hospitality."
               "The little Aglaë clung to his breast, murmured her childish phrases of endearment
                  and entreaty, and Rudolph was moved by some powerful sympathy to hold her in his
                  strong clasp as if she belonged to him, as if she had already become a portion of
                  his very being.
               He looked into the large soft eyes that were fearlessly raised to his; they
                  reminded him of Dora Calvert's, and he pressed his lips upon her brow, and
                  said:
               "The clinging arms of this little child fetter me as bonds of steel. I will remain till the morning, Madame,
                  since you so earnestly desire it."
               Madame St. Angeau expressed her pleasure with much animation. By this time what
                  had occurred had spread over the place, and a group of servants and farm laborers
                  gathered around the body of the leopard.
               "Let us go out and look upon the creature you so fearlessly slew," said the lady.
                  "My daughter had better see that he is quite dead, that her dreams may not be
                  haunted by him."
               "Will she have courage to do so, Madame?"
               "I have striven to make her brave and fearless; she is unlike other children in
                  many respects, and I think it will be best to show him to her."
               The child clapped her hands.
               "Yes, let me see him; I wish to see him."
               The three issued from the house, the little Aglaë still in Rudolph's arms, and
                  drew near the group on the lawn. They stood aside at their approach, and the
                  animal, lately so strong and powerful, lay supine before them, stretched out at
                  his full length with his deadly fangs glaring from his open mouth, ready to rend
                  the prey on which he was springing when arrested in his fearful career. He was one
                  of the largest of his species, and his skin was beautifully variegated with white
                  spots, with shadings of yellow and pale brown.
               After surveying him a few moments, Madame St. Angeau said:
               "Place your hand upon him, my Aglaë, and see that he can no longer harm you."
               The child sprang from Rudolph's arms, and fearlessly approached the
                  formidable-looking creature. She passed her small hand over his shining coat, and
                  lisped:
               "Maman says he cannot hurt me. I am not afraid."
               "Madame," said Rudolph, "your daughter will be worthy, at some future day, to
                  become the wife of a hero."
               "I shall try to render her equal to such a lot," replied the mother, with her
                  sweet, pensive smile. "I think that women should be reared to possess as much
                  self-possession in the hour of danger as the stronger sex, for they are often
                  fearfully tried. I shall aim to make my daughter equal to any emergency, though at
                  the same time I shall endeavor to cultivate in her all the grace and sweetness
                  that should distinguish the most timid woman. Ah, Monsieur, woful times are
                  preparing for this fated country, and who can foresee what we may yet have to
                  endure?"
               The first mutterings of the most fearful revolution the world has witnessed had
                  begun to be heard, and Rudolph understood enough of public affairs to feel the
                  force of her words. He replied:
               "You are right, Madame. Make your child strong and fearless, that she may breast
                  the waves of life in safety."
               At that moment the approach of a horseman, coming at headlong speed, was heard,
                  and a gentleman galloped to the edge of the lawn, threw himself from his steed,
                  and with an air of great excitement rushed forward. His face was pale, and his
                  eyes distended with fear till they fell upon the lady and child. With an
                  ejaculation of thankfulness, he clasped them in his arms, and presently said in
                  broken tones:
               "Oh, my precious ones, how have you escaped this danger? To whose courage is your
                  safety owing?"
               "But for this gentleman, who came at the critical moment, we should now be
                  childless, Armand. He slew the leopard, and saved our Aglaë from death."
               M. St. Angeau drew near the stranger, held out his hand, and after a pause of deep
                  emotion, said:
               "Monsieur, you have placed me under a life-long obligation tion. All I possess could ill repay the service you
                  have rendered me. When within a few miles of my home, I heard of the men who were
                  in pursuit of this fierce animal; that they had sought him near my chateau, and I
                  rode forward in a fever of apprehension. Through your gallantry I find all safe.
                  Accept my thanks, Monsieur; my friendship, for although I know not even your name,
                  the man who could perform what you have this day done, is, I feel, worthy of the
                  highest estimation."
               Rudolph warmly grasped his offered hand.
               "I accept your friendship, M. St. Angeau, and I will prove myself worthy of it. Do
                  not estimate my service too highly, for the performance of it has been a blessing
                  to myself. I needed something to bring me back into communion with my kind, and
                  God has sent me as the deliverer of this charming child, to prove to me that I can
                  yet be of some use on the earth."
               The penetrating eye of M. St. Angeau scanned the features of the speaker, so
                  youthful, yet so saddened, and he comprehended that no ordinary suffering prompted
                  his words. He cordially said:
               "I have called my home Tranquilité, and not without good reason, for the spirit of
                  peace and gentleness dwells in it, in the shape of my fair wife. You shall remain
                  with us a season, and feel the blessed influence she spreads around her. Shall it
                  not be so?"
               "I am a wanderer, without home or place of rest. I accept your invitation as
                  frankly as it is given; a few days will I tarry beneath your roof to refresh my
                  weary soul with the sight of that domestic happiness which, to me, is forever
                  lost. The name I bear is Michel."
               "Be assured, M. Michel, that we shall detain you as long as possible among us. Let
                  us enter the chateau, for it grows late, and the hour for supper draws near."
               As they turned toward the house, M. St. Angeau lifted the child in his arms, but
                  after kissing him, and prattling to him a moment, she held out her hand to her new
                  friend, and said:
               "Take me—hold me fast—for I love you."
               Rudolph clasped her to his breast with a feeling of tenderness which had not
                  visited his heart for many long months. He felt as if this little child was to
                  awake the deadened sympathies of his soul once more, and he was grateful for the
                  flood of sweet and gentle emotions that awoke within him. He had long felt as one
                  walking in a desert, but a new spring of humanity had been touched by the incident
                  of the day, and an oasis sprung up to gladden the life that had been rendered so
                  desolate.
               The lonely and wounded heart of the wanderer was touched by the kindness with
                  which he was received, and his new friends found means to detain him from day to
                  day, till a bond of affection was formed between them that he found it difficult
                  to break. He found M. St. Angeau to be a man of cultivated tastes, who had seen
                  much of life; he had served a campaign in the army, at the age of thirty had made
                  a love match, and retired to his paternal acres to spend his days in the tranquil
                  pursuits of a country life.
               This was most congenial to the taste of his wife, for in her home, with her
                  husband and child, surrounded by contented dependents, she found her whole
                  happiness; and the duties of the chatelaine were
                  never more gracefully performed than by Madame St. Angeau.
               The place was well named Tranquilité, for the "peace which passeth show" had taken
                  up its abode within its walls. The little Aglaë, tenderly and judiciously trained,
                  was the light of this serene household, her happy spirit its brightest sunshine;
                  and this charming infant seemed destined tined by Heaven to bring back peace to the stricken spirit of her
                  preserver.
               She followed him, prattled to him unceasingly, and clung to him with such winning
                  caresses, that it was impossible to resist her sweet willfulness. Day by day,
                  Rudolph might be seen walking to and fro upon the lawn leading Aglaë by the hand,
                  or carrying her in his arms, and the long vanished smile again came to his lip,
                  the light of affection to his eye.
               The parents looked on, charmed that she had power to detain their new friend near
                  them, until at least the deep depression, from which he evidently suffered, had
                  passed away; and they felt as if this mission had been confided to their innocent
                  child.
               The owners of the leopard learned his fate, and came to claim his skin, which had
                  been carefully preserved; but this M. St. Angeau wished to retain as a trophy; and
                  he satisfied them by paying them a sufficient sum to enable him to do so.
               When Rudolph spoke of leaving the chateau, he was so vehemently opposed, so many
                  reasons were given for prolonging his stay, that it seemed churlish to insist. A
                  pleasant circle frequently assembled around them, and hunting and fishing varied
                  the monotony of a country life; and in reckless riding, and the use of the shot
                  gun, the stranger soon proved himself superior to those he was thrown among.
               His host had a great desire to gain some knowledge of his previous life, but
                  Rudolph carefully guarded the secret of his nationality, and passed among them for
                  a Frenchman from the borders of the Rhine. As he also spoke German with fluency,
                  this was more readily believed.
               Summer deepened into Autumn, and still he lingered, charmed and solaced by the
                  friendly cares that surrounded him; but when the leaves began to fall, he felt
                  that he must go forth again, strengthened for the battle of life that lay before
                  him by this interval of repose. But he pledged himself to return again; his little
                  love, as he called Algae, should not be deserted by her chosen knight.
               Madame St. Angeau, who had considerable talent for painting, insisted on taking a
                  likeness of him before he left, as a memorial for her daughter, as she wished the
                  features of one who had so vitally served her to be vividly remembered by her
                  child. She succeeded in obtaining a striking resemblance, and the picture was
                  framed, and, at her own request, hung at the foot of Aglaë's bed; and in her
                  nightly prayers, the sweet child raised her clasped hands towards the image of her
                  friend, and asked God to remember him in his wanderings. Rudolph parted from her
                  with many caresses, bade adieu to his friends, and turned his steps toward Paris,
                  as there his funds were placed, and at that point he could more readily gain such
                  information as would enable him to volunteer in that portion of the army which was
                  engaged in active service.
               To pursue his military career was his fixed purpose; but without family or
                  fortune, he felt that he must again enter the ranks, and by his gallantry and
                  daring win his way upward, as he had before done in his native land.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE LEOPARDESS ON THE TRACK.
               AS the time for Helen's marriage drew near, Mrs. Fitzhugh returned to London, and
                  preparations were made for celebrating it in a Catholic chapel situated near their
                     hotel. On the evening before the
                  appointed day, Sir Reginald made his appearance, looking much excited and
                  harassed. He asked for a private interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and at once laid
                  before her a letter which had been delivered to him on his arrival in town.
               It was from Alina, and in it she announced the birth of a son; who she claimed to
                  be the legitimate heir of his father. She asserted her intention at some future
                  day to contest the right of Sir Reginald to succeed his brother, and take
                  possession of his inheritance.
               A certificate of the infant's birth was furnished by the physician who had
                  attended her, and also that of his baptism by a dignitary of the Catholic church.
                  He had received the name of Lionel De Vere, and Alina stated her intention to
                  struggle to the bitter end for his right, not only to bear it, but to succeed to
                  his father's estates. She ended:
               "As a Catholic, Sir Reginald, you cannot recognise the validity of my first
                  marriage, performed as the ceremony was, by a man who really had no authority to
                  exercise the priestly functions. The civil contract, to those of the only true
                  faith, has no significance, and if you are an honorable and true son of the
                  church, you will acknowledge that my son is the heir of your brother. As such I
                  put forth his claims, and I demand that they shall be recognised. If they are not,
                  I shall find means to enforce them."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh read this communication in silent consternation. She said:
               "Alina is mad to write such a letter as this to you. She must be aware that in
                  England the legitimacy of this child will never be recognized. She only seeks to
                  annoy you, that you may increase the annuity you have granted her."
               "I am quite ready to do that; I will double the sum, and assume the expenses of
                  the boy's education when he is old enough to receive one; but I can do no more. As
                  to the validity of the first marriage I shall not judge, but I am Christian enough
                  not to recognise the right of a wife, wedded by any legal form, to forsake her
                  husband. The laws of England sufficiently protect me from disturbance through this
                  absurd claim, but it is painful to me that it should be put forward just at this
                  crisis."
               "Alina detests her cousin, and she has purposely reserved this blow for the eve of
                  your marriage. I am afraid the existence of this child will place it in her power
                  to annoy you in the future, for my niece is a most persistent person in whatever
                  she undertakes, and if she can bring unhappiness into your household, I am sorry
                  to say she will spare no effort to do so."
               "I think I can defy her there," replied De Vere, with an assured smile. "She can
                  establish no influence over either Helen or myself, and malicious interference I
                  will never tolerate from any one. This unhappy woman has evidently deluded herself
                  into the belief that I am fanatic enough to take the same view of her position
                  which she and my brother chose to assume; but I recognise the law of the land in
                  which I live as supreme. She will doubtless say that in this I am guided by my own
                  interests, but it matters little to me what her opinion may be. I shall do what I
                  consider right, and submit my motives of action to a higher tribunal."
               "As I before said, I think Alina only desires money, for she must know that the
                  claim she sets up for her child is inadmissible. Write, and state to her what you
                  are willing to do, and I am certain that your proposed liberality will effectually
                  silence her pretensions."
               "I trust that it may have that effect, for I cannot bear that this story shall be
                  blazoned abroad, and become the parent of a thousand unpleasant rumors. For her
                  own sake, I should think Madam Derval
                  would shrink from such publicity as the prosecution of this ridiculous claim must
                  incur."
               "Alina shrinks from nothing, I am afraid. She is a bold, unscrupulous woman,
                  reckless of consequences if she can carry out her plans. Her present aim is to
                  cast an envenomed shaft at Helen on the eve of her marriage, for she can never be
                  serious in claiming that her son is really the heir to the title and estate."
               "Helen need know nothing of it; I will shield her from this piece of malice by
                  concealing it from her. I will write and settle the affair at once."
               He sat down and dashed off the following lines:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MADAME DERVAL:—Your letter has reached me, containing the
                              notification of the birth of your son, and also the extraordinary
                              claim you put forward for him. That it is untenable you must be as
                              well aware as I am, for the scriptures say, 'whom God hath joined
                              together, let no man put asunder.'
                           "You were united to your husband by one who spoke in the name of
                              Jehovah, and you then recognized his right to perform the sacrament of
                              marriage. Passion and sophistry led you to repudiate that right, but
                              in the eyes of every just man it is indisputable. Nothing can now
                              legitimate your child. The bar sinister would prevent his accession to
                              his father's estate, even if I did not stand in his path. I am willing
                              and anxious to do all that lies in my power for this unhappy child;
                              but I can never acknowledge him as the heir of my brother.
                           "It is my purpose to double the annuity I now allow you, and I will
                              also charge myself with the future education of your son. More than
                              this I neither can nor will do, and I counsel you to permit your
                              unhappy history to remain in obscurity. Your present position is
                              respectable, and you will certainly forfeit it if you attempt to
                              prosecute a claim which is utterly untenable.
                           "I am not a man to be trifled with, and I warn you that any attempt to
                              interfere in my domestic affairs will be promptly punished by the
                              withdrawal of your income. I am aware of the cause of the hostility
                              you cherish toward my intended wife, and I hold her blameless in
                              intention. The consequences that flowed from her wilful act could
                              never have been foreseen by her, and they have been bitterly lamented.
                              I hope you perfectly comprehend me, and that you will be aided by your
                              own sense of right to see the justice of my decision.
                           
                              R. DE VERE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This was sealed and addressed at once, and then the lover asked:
               "How did Helen bear the journey to town; I trust she is quite well."
               "Yes—and very happy, though a little nervous at the thought of to-morrow."
               "I wish I could see her a moment; but it is contrary to etiquette, I suppose, so I
                  will not insist. A few more hours, and she will be all my own. We will travel into
                  Wales, and there, in a charming cottage I have secured, spend the first halcyon
                  days of our union. In a few weeks, we shall return to Vere Castle, and you, dear
                  Madam, must be there to welcome us. Your apartments are ready for you, and
                  henceforth you will consider yourself one of our family. She who has been so true
                  a mother to my Helen, shall ever be regarded as one by me."
               "Thank you, dear Reginald. Helen is the child of my heart, and I could not be
                  happy if separated from her. I have promised to visit some old friends during your
                  bridal tour, but I shall be at the Castle in time to receive you."
               
               Leaving many messages for Helen, De Vere soon afterward departed, and Mrs.
                  Fitzhugh went at once to her daughter's apartment. To her dismay, she found Helen
                  weeping as if her heart would break. An open letter lay on the table beside her,
                  and a box with the cover thrown carelessly over it, was lying at her feet.
               "What has happened? What on earth is the matter with you?" asked Mrs. Fitzhugh, in
                  alarm.
               "Read this, and then look into that box and see what a bridal gift Alina has dared
                  to send me."
               In deep indignation, Mrs. Fitzhugh read the lines addressed to Helen on the eve of
                  her marriage:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "HELEN:—This letter will come to you when you have reached the topmost
                              wave of the prosperity your treachery toward me enabled you to gain;
                              yet beware! the cup is often dashed from the lip when it seems
                              brimming over with happiness. Its contents you may taste—for that I am
                              powerless to prevent—but the gall of bitterness and repentance shall
                              yet mingle with the draught.
                           "You shall not hug to your soul the triumphant thought that for you is
                              the glitter and sparkle of life—for me its shame and humiliation. I
                              have declared undying hostility to you, and I here repeat my vow. Know
                              that I am the mother of the true heir of Vere Castle; a son has been
                              given to me, and if there is justice on earth, he will yet succeed to
                              the inheritance of his father. No child of yours shall
                              supercede him; I have sworn it, and I will keep my word.
                           "Lull yourself into what security you may, listen credulously as you
                              choose to the tender voice of him who will assure you of his power to
                              protect you against me, but I shall yet find and strike you in your
                              happiness. Be assured of this, and every hour, every day of your life
                              look for the blow which shall reach a vital point, or my hand will
                              fail of its cunning.
                           "I send you a bridal robe, the most fitting for such as you to wear,
                              though I have no idea that you will honor me by appearing in it on the
                              auspicious occasion. N'importe; keep
                              it till anguish rends your heart, and then, perhaps, you will see its
                              fitness for one who should do penance all her life for the base wrong
                              she committed against her kinswoman.
                           
                              ALINA DERVAL."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter, and throwing back the top of the box, lifted a
                  robe of black serge, embroidered with frightful devices, representing the
                  punishment of souls in purgatory. It was evidently made in imitation of those worn
                  in past days by heretics condemned to expiate their sins by death at the funeral
                  pyre, though the figures on this were made ingeniously to tell the cause of feud
                  between the cousins, and to foreshadow its future punishment.
               "This is too great an outrage," said Mrs. Fitzhugh, indignantly. "Why did you open
                  the box at all, my dear? You must have known that its contents would annoy
                  you."
               "It arrived before the letter reached me, and my maid opened it in the belief that
                  it was Parisian millinery, which has been ordered from Madame Herbaux. For a few
                  minutes I was at a loss to know who could have insulted me thus, but Alina's
                  letter was brought in, and I understood all her malignity. Oh, mother, this has
                  made me very miserable, for I feel that my cousin's hostility will work me woe
                  yet."
               "Nonsense, my dear; Alina can only threaten; she has no power to perform. She has
                  also written to Sir Reginald, informing him of the birth of her son, and claiming
                  for him the succession to the estate. She is only baffled, and furious, and she
                  seeks every means to annoy you. Cheer
                  up, my love, for there is no danger that Alina can interfere in any way with your
                  happiness."
               "And what did Reginald say when he heard of the boy?" anxiously asked Helen.
               "He said what became him as a gentleman, and a good man; that he would provide for
                  the child, and increase the annuity he allows his mother. He wrote to her at once,
                  and showed her the true position she holds. Moreover, he threatened her with a
                  withdrawal of her annuity if any attempt is made to render you unhappy. Alina is
                  mercenary, and extravagant; she has sense enough to see where her true interest
                  lies, and we shall hear no more of her or her son's pretensions; be sure of
                  that."
               "Dear Reginald! he is so good, so noble, so considerate for my happiness. How can
                  I ever reward him for all his kindness?"
               "By being the best and happiest little wife in the world, to be sure. In what
                  better way could you hope to reward him?"
               "The first I will try to be; the last I shall surely be, if this evil influence
                  can only be removed from my life. But what shall I do with this robe?"
               "Send it back to the giver, of course. Alina has much more cause to wear it than
                  you, my love; and I shall tell her as much. But I will wait till after the
                  wedding, that I may return it in the name of Lady De Vere. Reginald did not wish
                  you to learn anything of the existence of this child, and the new annoyance to
                  which he has been subjected, but Alina took her own precautions to have it made
                  known to you. Such hatred as hers will not be baffled."
               "Alas! that is what I fear," said Helen, sorrowfully. "When Alina remembers that
                  my father was truly one to her, I do not know how she can thus persecute me.
                  Gratitude tude for his kindness should shield me from her, even if I have
                  unfortunately given her cause of anger.
               "My child, your cousin has no sentiment of any kind. Her mind is as hard, clear,
                  and brilliant as the diamond, which cuts through the hardest substance; but like
                  that gem, she needs a good setting, and the money which is dependent on her good
                  behavior, will have more weight with her than all your father did for her. After
                  she reads Sir Reginald's letter, she will leave you in peace, rest assured of
                  that."
               "I would that I could only think so; but time alone can convince me that she has
                  no power to harm me."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh ordered the box to be taken to her own apartment, with the intention
                  of returning it to Paris on the following evening.
               The bridal day dawned clear and brilliant, and at an early hour the few friends
                  who had been invited to attend the ceremony arrived. Helen, though pale and
                  tremulous, looked very lovely in her lace and orange blossoms. She had scarcely
                  slept during the previous night, and the only slumber she had fallen into was
                  broken by a frightful dream of Alina as a Gorgon, followed by the demons she had
                  caused to be wrought upon the robe of serge, coming to tear her from the very
                  altar. She awoke, palpitating with alarm, and for the remainder of the night,
                  sleep was effectually driven from her pillow.
               "Ah, my sweet blush rose, you have become as white as a lily," whispered De Vere,
                  "but the mountain air will soon bring back the roses to your cheeks again. I hope
                  you are not grieving that you must leave your mother to go with me."
               The quick flush that leaped to her cheek, and the soft glance of the eyes that
                  were shyly raised an instant to his own, replied to him even without the words she
                  breathed, though they were ineffably precious to him."
               
               "No, no, with you, always with you, shall I find peace and strength."
               He pressed her hand tenderly, and placed her in the carriage which awaited them.
                  In a few moments they were whirled to the door of the chapel where everything had
                  been prepared for their reception. After the usual preliminaries had been attended
                  to, the bridal pair, with their two attendants, placed themselves before the
                  altar. The service was half completed when a voice arose from the midst of a crowd
                  of people who had straggled in on learning that a marriage was being celebrated,
                  and, in shrill tones, exclaimed:
               "She's no match for him. Let her go back and put on her robe of penitence. That is
                  most suited to her on this day."
               The woman who uttered these words was wrapped in a heavy shawl, and a thick veil
                  concealed her features. They were no sooner spoken than she evaded those who
                  attempted to detain her, and succeeded in leaving the church.
               Helen, half fainting, clung to the arm of De Vere, and the priest paused in
                  astonishment. He then bent forward, and asked:
               "Is there any impediment, Sir Reginald, which can lawfully prevent me from
                  proceeding?"
               "None, so help me Heaven!" he emphatically replied. "The woman is mad, or moved by
                  some feeling of malice which I scarcely comprehend. Go on without delay."
               The priest had known him from his boyhood, and he felt assured that in every
                  circumstance of life, under every temptation, Sir Reginald De Vere would speak the
                  truth; he therefore completed the service as if nothing had occurred to interrupt
                  it.
               Helen recognized the source from which this insult came, and she was so overcome
                  with emotion that De Vere had almost to carry her in his arms to the carriage.
                  When they were again alone, he asked:
               "Have you any clue to what occurred in the chapel, Helen? It was a most wanton and
                  shameless insult, and if I could discover its perpetrator I would deal very
                  summarily with her."
               "Ah, do not ask me, Reginald, for you will feel that I have brought annoyance of
                  every kind to you when you are apprised of the truth."
               "I can only feel that you have made me the happiest of men, my precious Helen. You
                  know that you are the soul of candor, and for that I love you, so speak out and
                  unravel this mystery."
               "I wished to conceal the malice of my cousin from you, but she has rendered it
                  impossible. The woman who spoke in the chapel was, doubtless, sent by her for that
                  purpose; for she has sent me a most shameful bridal present, which my mother
                  undertook to return to her."
               "A robe of penitence I suppose from the woman's words. She had better take care,
                  for now she has not a feeble girl to deal with; but a man who will protect his own
                  at all hazards. Where is this garment, Helen?"
               "Oh! it is packed up to be returned, I would not have you see it on any account,
                  for it is the most frightful thing you ever looked on."
               "Well, pétite, I'll not insist. You can describe
                  to me the fanciful devices with which it is doubtless adorned, and that shall
                  suffice. It is her last insult, Helen; for, now that a strong arm has thrown its
                  shield over your fate, Alina will fear to cast her envenomed darts at you. Dismiss
                  all fear of her, my sweet love, for I possess the power to keep this vengeful
                  spirit in due bounds."
               "Oh, I hope so; but I tremble in spite of my better reason, when I think of my
                  cousin's threats."
               "They are but breath, breath Helen, foolishly expended. Do not permit your bridal
                  day to be clouded by them,—cling to me—trust me, and I will protect you from
                  evil."
               
               "I do—I will," and the traveling carriage rolled onward bearing two happy hearts
                  toward the exquisite seclusion De Vere had secured for this happy season of his
                  life.
               A cottage in the valley of Llanghollan, embowered in roses and shaded by venerable
                  oaks, received them; and there the Eden of our first parents seemed renewed to the
                  two who wandered together through the glades, or sailed upon the stream near their
                  dwelling, never weary of each other, but daily discovering some new trait to
                  appreciate and admire. They regretted the approach of the time appointed for their
                  return to the world; but a large party was expected at Vere Castle, to celebrate
                  their marriage, and they must be there in time to receive them.
               With many regrets the lovers bade adieu to their sylvan paradise, and on the
                  appointed evening reached the domain around the castle. They found the tenantry
                  assembled to welcome their landlord and his fair bride, and the children threw
                  flowers upon her as she passed; the people cheered, and the marriage bells rang
                  out their merriest peal.
               The carriage wound through a stately avenue toward a heavy pile of Tudor
                  architecture, which for centuries had been the home of the De Veres. A modern wing
                  had been added to the mansion, and in this the apartments of Helen were situated.
                  On the threshold she was met by her mother, and joyful was the reunion between
                  them. She raised her head from her bosom to receive the congratulations of other
                  friends who had gathered there to welcome her to her new home.
               The lawn was covered with tables at which the tenantry were feasted, and Sir
                  Reginald walked among them with his smiling bride hanging on his arm, that they
                  might see the mistress he had brought to reign over his ancient home. Blessings
                  followed them wherever they moved, and Helen was touched by the simple eloquence
                  of more than one of those uncultivated people.
               Mrs. Fitzhugh returned the robe to Alina with the following note:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Helen is now the wife of Sir Reginald De Vere; she is happy, and her
                              husband is competent to protect her against all your machinations. I
                              advise you to be circumspect in your course toward him, or you will
                              lose everything. He will be a good friend to your son if you leave his
                              future to his generosity, for only from that can you hope for
                              anything.
                           "The idle claim you set forward, you must be aware, can never be
                              brought to any issue to you but disgrace and defeat. The indignity you
                              have put on Helen it will be best not to attempt to repeat, for De
                              Vere will resent an insult to her in such a manner as will most
                              sensibly touch a mercenary woman like yourself.
                           "I can no longer sign myself, as I once did, your affectionate Aunt,
                              for your late conduct has effectually destroyed the regard I once felt
                              for you. Oh, Alina! repent before it is too late, and return to the
                              path of honor you seem to have abandoned.
                           
                              M. FITZHUGH."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Alina received this letter a few hours after that of Sir Reginald had reached her.
                  That had aroused intense anger, and this filled the measure of her rage. She was
                  seated in a luxurious apartment, in which every object that could charm the eye,
                  or gratify the sense of the beautiful, had been collected, regardless of
                  expense.
               The cradle of her infant, shaded by rose-colored curtains, draped with fine lace,
                  stood near her, and in it slumbered the boy she had vowed to elevate to the
                  station once occupied by his father. He bore upon his baby features the stamp of
                  his lineage, for the clearly-defined profile, the dark eyebrows, and raven curls
                  that lay in soft rings upon his forehead, presented a miniature copy of Sir Lionel
                  De Vere. Alina looked down upon him,
                  but the cloud did not leave her brow, nor the sternness her lip, as she
                  muttered:
               "Disenherited, cast off as you are, my child, you shall yet sit in the castle of
                  your fathers, lord of all. They think to baffle me; to buy me off
                  with this paltry annuity, which they even threaten to withdraw if I persist in
                  upholding your rights. Well, they shall yet find that I will prove more than a
                  match for them all. I can watch, and wait, and subtly pursue my plans, while they
                  cradle themselves in security. Lady De Vere! ha! ha! your heart shall
                  yet be wrung with anguish by the vengeance I will take upon you."
               Betty, the maid who had accompanied her from America, came in to see if the infant
                  needed anything; and Alina watched her as she bent over the child, and arranged
                  his pillow anew. This woman was dull and common-place, but she possessed one
                  strong instinct—a passionate fondness for children; and for this beautiful boy she
                  had already conceived an attachment of far deeper strength than that felt for him
                  by his scheming mother.
               Alina encouraged this by throwing much of the care of her son upon her, for
                  through the fanatical fondness of this untutored heart, she saw her way to the
                  accomplishment of the wickedness that dimly loomed before her in the future. She
                  comprehended the nature she had to deal with, and believed she could work out her
                  plans with the aid she confidently relied on from a being of such imperfect ideas
                  of right as Betty possessed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.
               THE funds of Rudolph had been placed in the banking-house of Rodrigues, Hortaling
                  & Co., of which one of the most remarkable men of his day was the principal,
                  Beaumarchais, the author of the Barber of Seville, and the firm and consistent
                  friend of American freedom. To the efforts of this man the independence of the
                  United States is due, more than to any other Frenchman. He it was who pressed upon
                  the ministers of Louis XVI. the necessity of assisting the revolted colonies; he
                  was permitted secretly to furnish them with arms taken from the arsenals of
                  France; and he fitted out ships at his own expense, to bring them to those who
                  stood in perishing need of them. But for his efforts, England might yet rule over
                  the Southern, as she does over the Northern portion of this continent. Rudolph was
                  aware of Beaumarchais' efforts to serve his country, and he had eagerly sought
                  opportunity to converse with him when he had accidentally been thrown with him in
                  Havre. He found him a man of enlarged views, great enthusiasm of character and
                  unflinching courage. Such a man had great attraction for him, and he had
                  transferred his money to his banking-house that he might have an opportunity to
                  see Beaumarchais again.
               On arriving in Paris, he sought his place of business, but was told that the chief
                  was not within. On inquiring where he might be found, his private address was
                  given, but the clerk said that the most probable place to find M. Beaumarchais was
                  under the shadow of the Bastile, near which gloomy prison he was building himself
                  a house, which he intended to rival Aladdin's palace.
               The Bastile! it had a thousand dreary and frightful associations ciations in the mind of the lover of freedom; but
                  it was a salient point in the city of Paris, and was easily found even by a
                  stranger. Rudolph soon stood beneath its gloomy walls, and after surveying them,
                  he easily discovered the spot on which Beaumarchais was erecting a fairy temple at
                  a fabulous cost, which Napoleon afterwards called his folly.
               In the space of an acre of ground, temples, grottoes, and winding walks were
                  erected in the busy heart of the city, of which no vestige now remains. The vanity
                  of the author of so many successful works as Beaumarchais had written, induced him
                  to believe that he would also bequeath to the world a lasting monument of his
                  architectural skill.
               As the clerk had foretold, the banker was on the spot with book and pencil, giving
                  directions to his workmen, and devising new plans for the embellishment of his
                  miniature grounds. All was confusion around him, but out of this chaos was to
                  arise a vision of taste and beauty which, for a few brief years, was the wonder of
                  his giddy countrymen; a home of dreariness and vexation to its owner during the
                  revolutionary days which were rapidly approaching, and was finally swept away
                  before the new order of things, as if a veritable chateau
                     en Espagne had arisen and melted away before one's eyes.
               Rudolph approached the tree under which Beaumarchais was standing, and examined
                  him at his leisure; for his attention was too much engrossed by the paper before
                  him, on which he was sketching a plan, to observe the vicinity of a stranger.
               The slender and elegant figure which had produced so great a sensation among the
                  courtly dames when he was first introduced at Versailles, had lost the graceful
                  porportions which then distinguished them, but his lofty stature and dignified
                  bearing showed him to be a man of mark. His features were regular and expressive,
                  and his dark eyes beamed with all their early fire, although the raven locks that
                  once played around his stately brow were now mixed with silver.
               Beaumarchais was a deeply interesting study to Rudolph, for here was a man, humbly
                  born, who by the force of his own energy and talent had raised himself from the
                  condition of a watch-maker, to become the companion and counsellor of princes; the
                  architect of an immense fortune; and last, though by no means least in his
                  estimation, the ardent and consistent friend of his struggling country.
               Presently a workman came to him for orders; they were rapidly and clearly given,
                  and as the man turned away the eye of Beaumarchais fell upon the stranger. Rudolph
                  advanced, bowed, and respectfully said:
               "I have the honor to recall myself to your memory, Monsieur Beaumarchais. We met
                  last winter in Havre, and I have opened an account with your house. I have already
                  visited your place of business, and was told to seek you here if I wished a
                  personal interview."
               "Where the heart is, the body is very apt to be found," replied Beaumarchais, with
                  his animated smile. "I remember you perfectly, M. Michel, and I am glad to meet
                  you just now. I find that I shall have some difficulty in settling my claims
                  against your countrymen, and I shall be glad to gain some information which you
                  can probably give me."
               "All I can give is at your service," replied Rudolph. "To the man who so
                  opportunely sent aid to a people struggling for their freedom, everything is due.
                  Command me, Monsieur."
               "Thank you; come and dine with me without ceremony at four. Here is my address; my
                  mind is now occupied with the business before me, but when we meet again I shall
                  be ready for you."
               
               An invitation to dine en famille with so
                  distinguished a man as Beaumarchais, was no slight honor in the estimation of him
                  who received it, and Rudolph promised to be punctual to the hour named.
                  Beaumarchais added:
               "When dinner is over, and our discussion is ended, if you feel inclined to
                  accompany me, we will go together to witness the performance of one of my pieces
                  at which I have promised to be present."
               "Thank you—that will indeed be a pleasure I was far from anticipating. I shall
                  esteem myself honored in sitting beside the author of the Barber of Seville when
                  one of his own pieces is acted."
               The brilliant smile of Beaumarchais flashed over his mobile lips, and he said,
                  with a half sigh:
               "Alas, my young friend, the old magician has almost lost his spell, but the sight
                  of your enthusiasm may bring back some of his early fire, and brighten him up for
                  the works he has now in hand. The literature of your country has yet to be
                  created, therefore your taste must be fresh and unpolluted by prejudice. I shall
                  like to witness the effect this piece will have upon you. It hits hard at abuses,
                  that must be corrected before this nation can emerge from the thraldom in which it
                  is held, and the spirit in which it has been received by my countrymen, proves
                  that they are fully alive to the necessity of a reform."
               "The country indeed seems on the eve of a great struggle, but I trust it will be a
                  bloodless one."
               "Doubtless, my young friend. The French nation is too great, too noble to rush
                  into a civil war. That is the direst calamity that could befall us."
               The speaker seemed to have forgotten his employment, but at that moment a workman
                  approached and made some inquiry of him that must be replied to immediately.
                  Rudolph bowed and said:
               "I will no longer interrupt you, Monsieur. At four you may expect me," and he
                  walked away to occupy the time in wandering through the city till the hour of his
                  visit drew near.
               He entered a café, opposite the Comedie
                     Francaise, to order lunch; he afterwards learned that this was the
                  café de Procope to which the theatrical critics of the day resorted to pronounce
                  judgment on such new pieces as were brought out. To this house Voltaire had once
                  gone in the disguise of an Abbé to listen to the
                  criticisms on his Semiramis. In the dull and dimly-lighted room a small knot of
                  speakers were now eagerly discussing the Marriage of Figaro. Rudolph listened with
                  interest, and learned that the King had positively prohibited the performance of a
                  piece which struck at the privileged classes, ridiculed the parliament, and
                  exposed the tyranny of the lettres de cachet.
                  After unheard-of difficulties, and the supervision of five censors of the press,
                  the indefatigable author had at last succeeded in getting the Marriage of Figaro
                  put upon the stage.
               This triumph was achieved, however, through the overwhelming curiosity of the
                  people to witness the performance of a comedy, which had already been represented
                  in private with signal success. The King at last yielded, through the fear that
                  its suppression would be more be more injurious to the Court than its performance,
                  and the people of Paris crowded nightly to the theatre to see the cherished abuses
                  of the government made ridiculous.
               This would be the fiftieth night of its representation, and public interest was
                  still unsated. Congratulating himself on the opportunity of being present in the
                  company of its author, Rudolph, having discussed his lunch, arose and left the
                  house.
               A few minutes before four, a cab set him down at the door of M. Beaumarchais, and he was immediately ushered
                  into an elegantly-furnished saloon, in which he found his host in the company of
                  his wife and daughter, the latter as yet a child in years. After introducing him
                  to these ladies, Beaumarchais drew him into a recess, and until dinner was
                  announced eagerly discussed his claims on the American government, and the chances
                  of having them speedily liquidated.
               As to the last, Rudolph could afford him little information, but he described to
                  him the resources of the country and the character of the people. When he
                  finished, Beaumarchais cheerfully said:
               "All will eventually be safe then, Monsieur. Such a nation as yours will never
                  repudiate a debt contracted as this has been."
               At that moment dinner was announced, and motioning his guest to take in his wife,
                  the old man drew the arm of his daughter within his own and placed her near
                  himself at the table. The dinner was elegant and recherché, but the genial manner and sparkling wit of the host gave
                  it its greatest charm.
               "Papa," asked the little Eugenia, "what will you do with all the money you will
                  make from Figaro?"
               "Do with it, ma pétite? Something good—something
                  noble, for it is my own money, made by the sweat of my brain, and I have the right
                  to use it as I will."
               "You will give it to a charity then?"
               "Yes, my darling—I intend to found a charity for the benefit of poor nursing
                  mothers, who have to work out for a living. I intend to provide a comfortable
                  place where their children can be taken care of while they are away from them.
                  What do you say to that?"
               The little girl clapped her hands:
               "It is charming—ah, you are the best of men, my papa."
               Beaumarchais regarded her with a droll smile.
               "I am afraid that not many would agree with you in that opinion, ma pétite, for I am the best abused of men. N'importe, I do the best I can, and leave the babblers
                  to their talk; it concerns me very little. Madame, if you and my daughter
                  accompany us to the theatre to-night, it is time you were getting ready."
               Madame Beaumarchais arose and left the room, accompanied by Eugenia. Her husband
                  explained that his family had seen the piece performed many times, but they
                  attended on this night because the actors gave the receipts to the charity he
                  intended to found.
               In a short time the carriage was at the door, and the party was rapidly whirled
                  toward the Comedie Francaise; a private box, with a lattice in front, was
                  appropriated to the author, as his presence, if known, would have produced a
                     furore of applause which he was desirous to
                  avoid.
               On their arrival they learned that the Court had returned from Versailles, and at
                  a late hour, the King and Queen had signified their intention of being present at
                  the performance. This was an honor which Beaumarchais sensibly felt, and as soon
                  as they were seated he turned to his guest, and said:
               "I am happy, Monsieur, that I brought you with me, for you will have an
                  opportunity to see our good King and our beautiful and gracious Queen. You will
                  soon see the Court enter the royal box."
               In fact, while he was speaking, the national air was struck up, and cries of
                     Vive le Roi, Vive la Reine, were heard. In a
                  few moments, a good-natured, heavy-looking man, wearing the cross of St Louis upon
                  his breast, led in a lady whose majesty of deportment, tempered by graceful
                  sweetness of expression, proclaimed the Queen. Maria Antoinette was then in the
                  flower of her youth and loveliness. Her form was exquisitely proportioned, and her
                     hands and arms were of marvellous
                  beauty. She carried her head with a certain regal air, which enabled a stranger to
                  distinguish the sovereign even when surrounded by the most beautiful women of the
                  Court; that head which was destined to fall beneath the axe of the executioner,
                  amid insult and despair. Her features were not perfectly regular, and her face was
                  of the long narrow oval peculiar to the house of Austria; but the almost
                  transparent brilliancy of her complexion, the serene light of her lovely eyes,
                  compensated for every other defect and fairly entitled her to the epithet of
                  beautiful.
               The audience arose and greeted her with vivas,
                  which she received with the captivating grace which was her most distinguishing
                  charm. When the royal pair were at length seated, the party which had accompanied
                  them entered, and occupied the seats behind them.
               Rudolph's breath came quick, and he passed his hand over his eyes to clear his
                  vision, for it seemed to him that a phantom had been evoked before him in the
                  person of one of the ladies in the Queen's suite. A woman scarcely less beautiful
                  than Maria Antoinette, arrayed in a sumptuous toilette, sat in such a position as
                  to be distinctly seen by him.
               It was, it must be Alina; yet how came she there, and with such surroundings?
                  Alina, calm, unruffled, and self-possessed, as if no wrong or evil had ever
                  darkened her life, certainly was before him. Could another so marvellously
                  resemble her, or was this indeed his false and perjured wife, who thus sat in the
                  very blaze of royalty, the companion of the pure and lovely Queen.
               It seemed impossible, and Rudolph fancied himself the victim of some fantastic
                  deception. He closed his eyes, to open them again upon the smiling face which he,
                  above all men, had cause to remember. When he had sufficiently recovered his
                  self-possession, he touched the arm of Beaumarchais, and asked:
               "Who is the fair woman in rose-colored satin and diamonds, who sits at the right
                  hand of the Queen?"
               "Ah! my young friend, you have an eye for beauty, it seems. That lady is, I
                  believe, a countrywoman of your own; at least she is the widow of an American
                  officer. She is the niece of the late Count Derval, and the heiress of his
                  fortune. Her uncle was a courtier of long standing, and the Queen, in her
                  goodness, has recently given her a place near her person."
               "A countrywoman of mine? Can you tell me anything more of her?" evasively replied
                  Rudolph.
               "Only that she lives at Versailles in an exquisite bijou of a cottage, when she is
                  not in attendance at the palace. She must be rich, for a handsome annuity is paid
                  to her through our house from a wealthy English baronet, who is probably a
                  relation. You seem greatly struck by the fair Comtesse, Monsieur.
               "She is very like one I once knew," Rudolph steadily replied; "but the Comtesse
                  Derval and myself have nothing in common with each other."
               "Except your nativity; you both claim the same fatherland, and I fancy she would
                  be happy to show some courtesy to her countryman. Suppose you accompany me to
                  Versailles to-morrow, and call on her. I have a suspicion that you have served in
                  the army of the Republic, and you may have chanced to know her husband."
               "Excuse me; I have no wish to recall to Madame Derval the souvenirs of her early
                  home. A woman who has the ambition to win, and the tact to fill, the high position
                  she has gained, will not care to remember the land of simple and frugal habits in
                  which she was reared."
               "Perhaps you are right; but it is a hard and cold heart that does not warmly welcome a compatriot in a
                  strange land. But the curtain is rising, and the play begins."
               With his attention divided between the stage and what was passing in the royal
                  box, Rudolph had no very distinct idea of the satirical piece that was enacting
                  before him, although the most popular actress of the day, Madame Sainval,
                  sustained the part of Countess Amabriva, and as Susannah, Mademoiselle Contat
                  enchanted the public by her grace and voice.
               The vociferous applause with which many of the hits were greeted, seemed to
                  displease the king, for a deep gloom gradually settled over his features, and more
                  than once the queen passed her hand over her face, to conceal the shade of painful
                  emotion that swept over it. Rudolph kept his eyes fixed on Alina, who coquetted
                  and flirted with the gentlemen in attendance, without apparently caring much for
                  the performance. He was glad that he was sheltered from observation, as he had no
                  wish to betray his presence in Paris to her, nor to disturb the belief she must
                  cherish, that the bravos sent by her to assassinate him had not accomplished their
                  purpose.
               But it was soon whispered among the audience that Beaumarchais was in the house;
                  the box occupied by him was pointed out, and at the close of the piece, the
                  audience arose en masse, and called for the
                  author, while they threw bouquets against the lattice which concealed him from
                  their sight.
               At this demonstration, Beaumarchais arose, threw back the screen, and stood bowing
                  and smiling before the enthusiastic crowd. Compliments and flowers were showered
                  upon him, and the presence of royalty of birth seemed forgotten in the homage
                  offered to the royalty of genius. But Beaumarchais was too old a courtier to
                  forget the regal woman who sat before him, pale and astonished at this outburst
                  burst. In spite of all opposition, Marie Antoinette persisted in coming hither,
                  and at this moment it seemed to her as if the first open insult had been offered
                  to the royal authority in the presence of the king himself. Beaumarchais made a
                  low reverence toward the royal box, but it was scarcely noticed, and the queen
                  arose to retire.
               At that moment there was a commotion among her ladies; one of them suddenly
                  dropped her opera glass, and fell back as if fainting.
               "What is the matter with the Comtesse Derval?" asked the sweet, clear voice of
                  Marie Antoinette.
               "She is overcome by the heat and confusion. We must get her away as soon as
                  possible," replied the court chamberlain. "The royal carriages are ready, your
                  Majesty, and the cortége is formed."
               The brilliant array passed out, and Alina, almost supported in the arms of her
                  cavalier, was placed in a carriage with two other ladies, who overwhelmed her with
                  inquiries as to the cause of her sudden illness. She said:
               "The heat made me faint, and the vivas have given me a violent headache. Truly, it
                  was an ovation to M. Beaumarchais."
               "Well, my dear, I thought it was something you saw in his box that made you ill,
                  for you were talking gaily enough to Count d'Ernonville when you lifted your glass
                  and looked toward it. The next moment you looked as if you had seen a spectre,
                  though I saw only M. Beaumarchais, with a very handsome young man by his
                  side."
               Madame L'Estrange was the speaker, and at that moment she had no idea that her
                  protégeé had seen the husband she had been taught to believe in his grave on the
                  other side of the Atlantic. Alina had endeavored carefully to conceal from her the
                  true facts of her history, for Madame, although a very good friend of hers, she
                  felt was not implicitly to be trusted. She peevishly said:
               
               "I do not know what made me ill. Who can account for such sudden seizures? As to
                  who was, or was not, in M. Beaumarchais' box, I am perfectly indifferent. The
                  stranger you remarked is nothing to me."
               "Yet he must have reminded you of something or some person it was painful to
                  recall," said the persevering baroness; "for women do not grow faint at the sight
                  of so good-looking a man as that, without a cause. Come, my dear—there is no one
                  here but Madame de Lille, and she is as deaf as a post. You can enlighten me as to
                  the cause of this scene, without making her the wiser."
               "But, Madame, there is really nothing to tell. I became suddenly giddy—that is
                  all."
               "Ta! ta! child. You're not one of the kind to grow ill from heat; but
                  if you don't choose to confide in me, after all I have done for you, I have
                  nothing more to say."
               Thus pressed, Alina reluctantly replied:
               "Then, if you insist on knowing the truth, the person I saw in Beaumarchais' box
                  is an American, whom I have met in company with my husband. The sight of him
                  brought back so many painful memories, that—that I lost my self-possession."
               "No wonder," said Madame L'Estrange, drily. "Perhaps it was the good man
                  himself."
               "Madame, what can you mean?"
               "What I said, my dear: that this handsome young stranger is Monsieur himself. A
                  little bird whispered to me that my fair young friend made a misalliance; that she
                  eloped from her husband with an English Milor, and a duel à l'outrance ensued, in which the father of her child
                  perished. Do not faint again, my dear, because I have nothing at hand to restore
                  you. I only tell you this to prove to you that you had better have confided in me
                  from the first."
               "How have you learned this scandal?" asked Alina, angrily. "You must have tampered
                  with my maid, who was pledged to keep my secret."
               "Ah, my dear, that good Betty is no match for me. She is stupid as an ostrich, and
                  I picked a few things out of her, almost without her knowledge. The valet and your
                  good aunt furnished a few more hints, and my own cleverness pieced them all
                  together. I think M. Mesmer would give me the credit of being a pretty good
                  clairvoyant, eh?"
               "And what use do you intend to make of the knowledge you have thus gained?" asked
                  Alina, faintly.
               "Do not alarm yourself, child, for I have no wish to injure you. On the contrary,
                  on your prosperity my own fortune is to be based; you must marry a rich man, but
                  to do this securely your husband must be got safely out of the way. Tell me the
                  truth. Was that he?"
               "It was," was the faint response.
               "And he has followed you hither, probably to make another esclandre?"
               "No, he has given me up forever. I am free from all fear of disturbance from
                  him!"
               "Then why did you betray so much emotion to-night?"
               "Because I thought him dead, and his sudden apparition seemed as of one from the
                  grave.'"
               "So—o—then you have tried to put him there, and been foiled—eh? is it not so?"
               "Madame, you infer very strange things—draw most unwarrantable conclusions.
                  Besides, this conversation is dangerous. Madame De Lille may catch its drift in
                  spite of her deafness."
               "Never fear, for she can only comprehend when one screams at her; though, if you
                  are innocent, you need not care if she does understand us."
               This was a master stroke which Alina felt, and in a tone that was very humble for
                  her, she asked:
               
               "What has induced you to entertain such suspicions of me? I have done nothing to
                  incur them, I am very sure."
               "Well, my dear, we differ a little about that. A woman in your position does not
                  causelessly have secret negotiations with a person in Paris whose reputation is
                  more than questionable. One who, in fact, will undertake to use aqua tofana, or the steel, for those who pay liberally
                  for the service. Have you not done this?"
               "Madame," said Alina, haughtily, "since you have entered my house to play the part
                  of a spy upon me, I will no longer tolerate your presence. You can make your
                  arrangemements to leave as soon as may be convenient to you."
               "Softly—softly, Madame la Comtesse; do not lose your temper, and commit an
                  imprudence which you can never repair. But for me you would never
                  have gained the position you now fill; and a word from me can hurl you from it. I
                  will not withhold that word unless you treat me with the consideration that is due
                  to me. I have watched you for the purpose of gaining power over you, for I have
                  plans that you can further if you choose to do so, and in serving me also
                  essentially benefit yourself. Choose your course; for on yourself depends your
                  future elevation or your ruin."
               Alina felt that in craft and want of principle the speaker was quite a match for
                  herself, and reluctant as she was to place herself under the guidance of another,
                  she fully understood that no other resource now remained to her. Madame L'Estrange
                  was evidently informed of her most secret affairs, and after a few moments of
                  perturbed thought, she said:
               "You have done much for me, Madame, and I recall my hasty words. I regard you as
                  my best friend, and I trust that nothing will occur to produce further
                  misunderstanding ing between us. We can be of mutual service to each other, and it
                  would be silly to quarrel when we have so much at stake. Accept my apologies, and
                  forget what I lately said."
               "Now you speak like a sensible creature, as you are. We fully understand each
                  other, and I will soon develop to you a scheme which will ensure you the most
                  brilliant fortune, if you properly use the craft with which nature has endowed
                  you. And now about this young man—what brings him to Paris, and how comes he to be
                  in the company of Beaumarchais?"
               "Beaumarchais is a banker; he has dealings with the Colonies, and business
                  relations have probably grown up between the two, for after leaving the army the
                  person of whom we speak dropped his last name and embarked in trade. He came to
                  Havre, where he resided several months.
               "And where you thought him safely buried?"
               "I did; I have his pocket-book with his own writing within, which was sent me as
                  an assurance that—that he no longer existed."
               "Then your agent has played you false, and she must be made to understand that the
                  service must yet be performed. This man is doubtless aware of the unsuccessful
                  attempt made upon his life; he may be dangerous to you in the future, and should
                  be properly dealt with. Self-preservation is our first instinct, and you must see
                  that while he lives you are not safe."
               "It was not fear of him that impelled me to the course I pursued,"
                  said Alina, defiantly, "for I do not feel it. He knows that I am his
                  uncompromising enemy, for I have told him so, and he also knows that I have
                  sufficient cause. His hand destroyed the life of my child's father,
                  and is not that sufficient cause of deadly vengeance against him?"
               
               "Perhaps it is—but the code of honor recognizes the right of the husband to kill
                  him who destroys his domestic happiness. You are but a woman, and can visit
                  retribution on him only through the agency of others; therefore I do not blame you
                  for the course you have pursued. My only regret is that you have failed, for now
                  you have the whole business to do over again."
               "I will not be foiled this time," said Alina, sternly. "I will follow him up till
                  I am sure that my vengeance is accomplished. No peace—no rest shall
                  he have, till he finds it in the silence of his grave."
               "Eh bien! my dear; finish this act in the drama
                  of your life, and the curtain rises on a new and more brilliant scene. I will soon
                  develop my plans to you, but now I am sleepy, and this dear De Lille is actually
                  snoring. It was very tiresome of the Queen to insist on returning to Versailles
                  to-night, for I am really fatigued to the point of exhaustion."
               She threw herself back, and in a few moments was slumbering as serenely as if the
                  preceding conversation had been of the most innocent nature. Alina, excited and
                  restless, could not sleep. She put aside the curtain near her, and looked out on
                  the moonlit landscape, little dreaming of the wild turmoil that road was to
                  present a few years later, when the first act of the fearful tragedy of the
                  Revolution was enacted.
               Alina had already imbibed the spirit of the class among whom she was thrown, and
                  looked down with contempt upon the masses that were seething with the long
                  repressed rage that was soon to break forth in a volcano of blood and retribution,
                  which made the civilized world stand aghast.
               She sat there revolving her own dark schemes, unconscious that partly through her
                  agency one of the most deadly blows against the unhappy Queen was to be dealt.
                  Madame L'Estrange was a subtle and daring intriguante, who hesitated at nothing
                  which promised to better her fortunes; and unscrupulous as Alina was, the plan she
                  developed to her on the following day, which was to be carefully and slowly
                  followed out to its completion, filled her with fear. She would have recoiled, but
                  her tempter had her grasp upon her fate, and nothing but submission or ruin
                  remained to her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               THE LOST HEIR.
               NEARLY four years have passed away since Sir Reginald De Vere led Helen to his
                  home a fair and happy bride. The love that united them knew no shadow of change,
                  for both were upright, noble and true, and never did domestic happiness wear a
                  fairer or more serene aspect than in their household.
               He steadily and honorably fulfilled his duties as an English gentleman of large
                  estates and wide spread influence; and Helen, with her active temperament and
                  benevolent instincts, was a fitting helpmate for such a man. As time rolled on,
                  and their horizon was undarkened by a cloud, Helen laid aside her vague fears of
                  her cousin, and blossomed in the sunshine of affection that surrounded her. The
                  half-formed girl developed into a most attractive and elegant woman, who performed
                  the honors of her home with graceful tact, and during the fashionable seasons in
                  London, she shone as a "bright, particular star" among her compeers.
               De Vere was proud of his wife, and he had but one desire that fortune had not favored. He wished for
                  an heir to his ancient name; a daughter had been born in the first year of their
                  union, and although the little girl was loved and petted as few children are,
                  still her father could have wished that Heaven had given him a son instead. This
                  hope was at length realized, and when the little Ida was nearly three years old, a
                  baby brother was given, at whose birth bonfires blazed, ale flowed like water, and
                  every tenant on the estate had a present sent him in the name of the young
                  heir.
               Sir Reginald wished him to be named for his deceased brother, and with some
                  reluctance, Helen consented. The fate of Sir Lionel was the only shadow on her
                  bright path, and she could not recall it without a cold thrill of fear that on
                  herself some retribution would yet fall for her indirect agency in bringing it
                  about. She believed Alina impotent to work her any mischief; but if her wrong
                  demanded reparation, she feared that a higher power would visit it upon her. If
                  punishment came, she must recognize it as a Nemesis sent by fate itself, and not
                  the work of any human hand, however ready that hand might be to strike her to the
                  heart.
               Her fears had long been laid to rest, but after the birth of this child, they
                  arose again in spite of her better reason. She watched over him with the feeling
                  that her treasure had only been lent to her for a season, and through him the
                  first bitter trial to her maternal heart would be received. Yet the child was
                  healthy and strong, and bade fair to live long to enjoy the honors to which he was
                  born.
               Preparations for a magnificent christening were made, and their friends bidden to
                  the Castle to join in the festivities of the occasion. Helen would have preferred
                  a more quiet offering of her child in baptism, but Sir Reginald was so proud of
                  his heir, so anxious to exhibit him to his friends, that she could not oppose his
                  wishes, and the castle, as soon as she was strong to bear the excitement, was
                  filled with company. A priest of distinguished talents came down from London to
                  officiate, and robes of regal elegance were provided for the new heir.
               On the morning of the auspicious day, Sir Reginald came into his wife's room, and
                  together they went into the nursery which opened from it, to look upon the
                  slumbering child.
               "Oh, Helen," said the happy father, "this is the crowning blessing of my life. The
                  boy is beautiful and strong; he will grow up to be my hope and pride. I love my
                  little Ida most tenderly, but this boy is to maintain the honor of my house, to be
                  its representative; and to train him for this sphere, shall be the pleasure and
                  business of my life."
               "And with such an example as his father, he must become a good man," said Helen,
                  fondly clasping his hand.
               "Heaven has been bounteous to us, my beloved; our sky has been so unclouded, that,
                  at times, I almost fear some change must come."
               "Ah, ungrateful Helen! after all our blessings, you cannot learn to trust in
                  Providence. Never anticipate sorrow, my love, for has it not been said,
                  'sufficient to the day is the evil thereof?' If clouds arise upon our horizon, we
                  must have faith to look steadily upon them, with the assurance that they will
                  break away again, and the sun will once more shine upon us. In this hour, with my
                  dearest hopes realized, I have no room in my heart for doubts or fears. God is
                  above us all, and He knows that we have done nothing to merit severe
                  chastisement."
               "Forgive me, Reginald. I will endeavor to cherish your confident faith. I am
                  indeed ungrateful to doubt the goodness of God, when He has already so abundantly
                  blessed us. But I cannot resist the feeling that this child, which is so precious
                  to us, is rather lent than given."
               
               De Vere grew pale, and he bent over the infant with an expression of solicitude.
                  He presently said:
               "Helen, this is fantasy; I never saw a stronger, healthier child of his age. He
                  bids fair to live to become a patriarch: he will yet lay your head and mine in the
                  grave, and reign as Sir Lionel De Vere in the home of his fathers. Put away this
                  cloud, my sweet wife, and prepare to look your loveliest this evening. The mother
                  of such a boy as this should show how proud she is to present her young immortal
                  at the sacred font."
               Helen smiled, kissed the child tenderly, and returned to her own room. The day
                  passed away in the usual pursuits within doors, but the servants observed a
                  strange woman loitering about the grounds, apparently watching an opportunity to
                  enter the house. She was warned away, and concealed herself in the shubbery, still
                  intent upon the purpose that had brought her there; though her conduct in the
                  seclusion she sought was very singular.
               She knelt upon the ground with a rosary in her hand, rapidly repeating prayers,
                  which were occasionally interrupted by broken exclamations:
               "I have absolution for the deed—I took care to secure that beforehand: but the
                  father would have refused it if he had suspected that a little babe must be——Oh,
                  Lord! a poor, sinless little lamb! receive him into your paradise, and pardon the
                  hand that sends him there!"
               "My darling must have his own, and this one comes to take it from
                  him. These proud people have trampled on my lady, and now their own turn is come.
                  Oh, Heaven pardon me, and grant me absolution for this sin!"
               Thus muttered Betty, in a paroxysm of fear and doubt as to the perpetration of the
                  crime she had been sent there to commit. Alina had an agent in her pay in the
                  vicinity of the castle, who transmitted to her an account of all that happened
                  there, and the birth of the heir was duly announced. Then she brought all her evil
                  powers of persuasion to bear against this woman, whose fanatical idolatry of her
                  nursling had become the passion of her life. Betty adored the boy, and after much
                  persuasion she was induced to believe that it was her duty to remove his rival
                  from his path. She was extremely dull, naturally submissive, and was easily
                  wrought on by one she respected, to commit any act sanctioned by a better judgment
                  than her own. Alina had treated her with uniform kindness; she had even forborne
                  toward her when she learned that Betty had betrayed portions of her history to
                  Madame L'Estrange, and she had thus won a lasting influence over her. To serve her
                  mistress, and establish the imaginary rights of her son, the woman was ready to
                  risk even her soul's salvation. In their parting interview, her employer had
                  said:
               "The girl is of no consequence; she may live to become the future wife of my son,
                  and thus ensure his succession to his father's estate; but the boy must be so
                  stealthily made way with, that no trace by which his fate is accomplished shall be
                  detected. You must gain admittance into Vere Castle, smother the child, and escape
                  as silently as you entered. If you accomplish this, Betty, without permitting a
                  suspicion to fall on me, my son shall grow up to believe you the best friend he
                  ever had."
               "And it's true that I am that, ma'am. I am going to prove it by my acts."
               Thus with her one idea of loyalty to the child she loved so fondly, Betty crossed
                  over to England, came to the vicinity of the castle, and lay in wait to accomplish
                  her dire purpose. She heard in the village of the grand christening about to be
                  celebrated, and doubted not that in the confusion of the night, she could make her
                  way into the nursery, where she would conceal herself till sleep fell upon the household, then accomplish her
                  nefarious task, and escape before her presence had been detected.
               The chapel attached to the Castle was brilliantly illuminated, and the whole
                  household, servants included, crowded to see the ceremony performed. The infant
                  opened his large eyes and looked on the lights and the fair forms that clustered
                  around him without crying, and the ladies pronounced him a perfect love. His proud
                  father held him in his arms, while the priest pronounced the blessing of the
                  church upon him, and then the whole party returned to the house.
               A band played the fashionable music of the day, and the younger portion of the
                  company soon formed quadrilles, and continued to dance till a late hour of the
                  night. The infant was taken to the nursery in a sound sleep; the nurse entrusted
                  with the charge hurriedly disrobed him and placed him in his cradle. The two
                  servants whose duty it was to attend to him had strict orders to watch in turn
                  beside him; but, apprehensive of no danger, they both went to the gallery that
                  looked down upon the large hall in which the dancers were assembled.
               A chamber light was left in the nursery, which was a large old-fashioned room,
                  with deep recesses in front of the windows, shaded by heavy curtains. Screened
                  from observation by one of these, was the agent of Fate, sent to work such woe to
                  that happy family. She was pale and tremulous, and at moments an expression of
                  indecision swept over her face. She listened to the sounds of mirth that filled
                  the air, and muttered:
               "Ye dance now, and make merry, but the cries of woe and wailing will soon fill
                  these chambers. Oh, Lord, forgive me, for I fear—I fear, that I am sinning
                  unpardonably in thy sight."
               With light steps, Betty drew near the cradle, lifted the cloud of lace that fell
                  around it, and looked down upon the child. A ray of light fell upon his fair
                  features, which, at that moment, were smiling; a superstitious dread came over
                  her, and she muttered:
               "Holy Mary! he is the image of the Christ-child in that beautiful picture at
                  Versailles, that I can never pass without stopping to look at. Oh, Lord! must
                  I—can I stifle his sweet breath? His face will haunt me to my dying hour, looking
                  so calm and heavenly. It is soon done, but oh! my hand trembles; and my heart
                  seems as if it will burst from my bosom. Hark! there is a step! If I am found
                  here, I am lost."
               She hurriedly dropped the curtains, and shrouded herself in the recess of the
                  window just in time to avoid detection. The nursery maid came flying in nearly
                  breathless, and the cause of her haste was immediately apparent, for Lady De Vere
                  came in from her own apartment to see if her children were quietly sleeping. She
                  bent over the bed of the little girl, kissed her brow, and asked of the girl:
               "Has the baby continued to sleep calmly, Jane? I was afraid such unusual
                  excitement would make him restless."
               "Oh! he's slept like an angel, as he is, my lady. You needn't feel uneasy about
                  him. Winny and me will take good care of him, be sure of that."
               Helen examined him herself, and saw that he was in a sweet slumber; then giving
                  the girl strict injunctions to remain beside him till Winny came to take her
                  place, she departed to her guests, satisfied that her treasures were safe.
               The echo of her steps had scarcely died away, when Jane arose, looked around the
                  room, and muttered:
               "I've given the baby a sleeping potion, and it's no use staying here till Winny
                  comes. I'll keep an eye on my lady, and if I see her coming up the staircase, I
                  can get here in time, as I did just now. So, I'll go at once."
               
               She left the room, and after a few moments Betty again came from her place of
                  concealment; but she seemed more nervous and tremulous than before. The sight of
                  the mother's solicitude had touched a cord in her heart, for, as we before said,
                  the strongest instinct of her nature was a passionate love for children, and the
                  fondness of this fair and gentle woman for her helpless little ones, placed before
                  Betty all the anguish she was about to inflict on one who had never injured her.
                  With faltering steps she again drew near the cradle, and looked upon its helpless
                  occupant. His strong resemblance to Alina's son at that moment struck her, and she
                  wildly muttered:
               "I can never do it—never! It would be like killing my own Lionel—my precious
                  darling. Yet how can I go back without doing my errand? My lady will never forgive
                  me; she will cast me off, and I shall see my darling no more."
               In a paroxysm of desperation, she lifted a pillow from the little girl's bed, and
                  whispered:
               "It is but five minutes work—in that time he will cease to breathe forever, and no
                  trace will be left to tell how he passed away. Oh yes—yes—in my heart—in my brain,
                  the memory will be forever goading me on to madness. I cannot—no—no I dare not;
                  yet I must do something—I dare not go back and tell her
                  the boy is yet with his parents."
               After a few moments of fearful indecision, she collected together the clothing
                  which had been taken off the two children, rolled it in a bundle, and lifting the
                  infant, she carefully wrapped him in the dark shawl she had worn around her own
                  shoulders. Then placing the rude substitute in the place the boy had lately
                  occupied, Betty stealthily made her way down the private stair-case through which
                  she had gained access to the apartment, and fled swiftly through the shrubbery,
                  scarcely knowing what step she would next take to escape detection.
               Betty was strong, and swift of foot; the light weight of the child was scarcely an
                  incumbrance, and the kidnapper dashed through the woodland with the wild speed of
                  a hunted tigress. She presently slackened her speed, and walked steadily onward
                  for an hour. Then a cart going to market in a neighboring town overtook her, and
                  the driver good-naturedly permitted her to take a seat in it till they entered the
                  town.
               A horn was blowing, and a stage coach stood at the door of the principal inn; this
                  she ascertained was starting for London, and, after getting a cup of milk for the
                  child, who awoke and cried for nourishment, Betty took a vacant place in the
                  coach, for she knew that in the vast metropolis she stood a better chance to
                  conceal herself, and find some means of disposing of her charge in such a manner
                  as to prevent him from being traced and recovered.
               She had a sufficient supply of money, and on her arrival in the city her first
                  care was to seek an obscure lodging; safely established in it, she destroyed the
                  costly clothing the infant wore, and substituted for it such garments as were
                  suitable to the child of a person in her own station. On the second evening after
                  her arrival, placards were put up throughout London offering a large reward for
                  the recovery of the boy, and Betty feared to take any step toward ridding herself
                  of him in England.
               No resource remained but to take him with her to France, and there find means to
                  conceal his existence from her mistress; for, during the few days she had had
                  charge of the helpless little creature, her distaste to the thought of destroying
                  him had strengthened into a positive purpose to save him, if she found it possible
                  to do so.
               Betty had once lived in a small fishing village near Dover, and thither, after
                  many difficulties, she made her way. She had not been there for eight years, and
                  the story she told of her recent
                  widowhood, with this young infant to rear, was easily credited. She represented
                  herself as having friends in France whom she was anxious to rejoin as soon as
                  possible, and, in a few hours after her arrival, a lugger departed for the
                  opposite coast, on which she was received as a passenger.
               How she reached Paris, or what disposition she finally made of the stolen child,
                  she refused to reveal. After three weeks absence, she appeared at La Rosiére,
                  looking worn and weary; and in reply to Alina's eager enquiries she only said:
               "The lad will trouble you no more, Madame. His parents mourn for him as for one
                  numbered with the dead."
               "Betty," said her mistress sternly, "you seek to deceive me; for, in place of
                  destroying the child as you pledged yourself to do, you have only removed him.
                  What have you done with him? I demand an explicit reply, for Sir Reginald De Vere
                  has written me a most insulting letter accusing me of some agency in this affair,
                  and conjuring me to restore his son to him. Speak—what have you done with the
                  infant?"
               "Oh, ma'am, he's put out of your way. I tried to save him, for my heart failed me;
                  but it came to that at last, and I'd better have done it at first, in place of
                  raising all this uproar about a poor little manikin that hadn't life enough in him
                  to bear the rough time he had after I took him away from the castle."
               "And he is really and truly dead?"
               "Havn't I already told you as much, ma'am? And now what'll ye do about Sir
                  Reginald? I hope he won't come here to ask questions, because I'm not in a fit
                  state to answer 'em."
               "I scarcely think he will treat me with such indignity. I have written to him
                  denying all knowledge of what has happened, and defying him to trace any
                  complicity in the affair to me. If he should come here, I will send you into the
                  country with Lionel, to save you from meeting him."
               "Yes ma'am," replied the woman vaguely. "That will be best; if I saw him, all
                  would come out, for I'm strangely shaken of late."
               "My good Betty, don't give way to fancies. Keep my secret, and your own, and your
                  reward shall be great. Besides, to you my son will owe his inheritance, and I
                  shall not fail to impress on him the gratitude he owes you. Look at him now, how
                  he holds out his arms to welcome you back."
               Betty sprang toward the boy, who, just aroused from slumber, looked as charming as
                  an infant love. He was now nearly four years old, and he prattled his glad welcome
                  to his nurse with many caresses, which were passionately returned by her; and
                  Alina looked on with the certainty that, through Betty's affection for her son,
                  she could mould her to any purpose.
               The uncertainty of the woman's answers induced Alina to believe that she was
                  attempting to deceive her as to the fate of the child, and for many weeks she kept
                  a strict surveillance over her; but Betty made no attempt to communicate with any
                  one; all the interests and hopes of her life seemed centred in her home and her
                  nursling, and gradually her mistress adopted the belief that she had spoken the
                  truth with reference to the young heir.
               While this dark deed was perpetrated, mirth and music reigned in Vere Castle. The
                  dancing was kept up till near daylight, and the giddy nursery maid only looked in
                  twice to see if the children were sleeping quietly. She did not approach the
                  cradle near enough to perceive that an inanimate bundle of clothing represented
                  the living form which had been so stealthily removed.
               
               Lady De Vere, overcome with fatigue, retired at two o'clock, and Sir Reginald
                  ordered the head nurse to take charge of the children and see that they did not
                  disturb their mother, who greatly needed repose. The woman and girl, extremely
                  tired themselves, merely ascertained that all was quiet within the nursery, and
                  throwing themselves upon their own bed, were soon buried in sleep from which they
                  were to be most startlingly aroused.
               Soon after daylight Helen awoke from a terrific dream, in which she saw her son
                  thrown from a lofty precipice, and hastily rising, she threw on a dressing robe
                  and came into the nursery. Ida lay peacefully sleeping, with her shining curls
                  scattered over her pillow; and, after one glance at her, the mother flitted to the
                  side of the cradle, lifted the drapery, and uttered a piercing shriek.
               "Oh! my child! my child! Wretches, what have you done with him! Where—where have
                  you hidden him, and who has placed this semblance of him here?"
               Winny sat up, rubbed her eyes, and gazed around her in bewildered surprise:
               "What is it, my lady? The precious darling was sleeping sweetly when I came in
                  last."
               De Vere, aroused by his wife's cry, hurried on his clothes, and came in to find
                  her fainting in the arms of the woman, while the girl was wildly seeking through
                  the room for some trace of the missing infant.
               He apprehensively asked:
               "What has happened here?" and his cheek blanched as his eyes fell upon the bundle
                  of clothes that occupied his son's place in the cradle.
               "Oh, Sir—I—I am not to blame," whimpered the nurse. "I left Jane to watch here,
                  while I looked down at the fine company. Ask her what has become of the sweet
                  baby."
               "I don't know nothing about it," stammered Jane—"I—I thought the child was in his
                  bed. I was tired, and slept so sound that somebody's been an' took him away when I
                  didn't know nothing about it."
               "Oh, God!" groaned the unhappy father. "What can this mean? Go through the house;
                  raise the alarm that the child is missing, while I take your mistress to her
                  room."
               He lifted Helen, who seemed as if dead, and laid her on her bed—in a few moments
                  the alarming news spread through the castle, and a group of pale faces gathered
                  around its mistress. It was long before she was restored to consciousness, and her
                  first words were:
               "Where is he? where is my child?"
               De Vere replied with assumed firmness:
               "He shall soon be restored to you, my love. I have already taken measures to trace
                  his abductor, and a dozen mounted men have gone in every direction to spread the
                  news, and offer a large reward for my son's recovery."
               "Then he is really gone—gone! Oh! my heart will break! Let me go after him; let me
                  follow him through the world till I find him again," and she started up.
               "Helen—darling wife, you must be calm. I will do all that man can do to recover
                  our little one, but you must summon your fortitude to bear this blow. Our child
                  will be restored us, I am sure that he will."
               "Who can have dealt this stroke?" she passionately asked. "Yet why do I not at
                  once recognize the only hand from which it could come? Send to Alina, and demand
                  my child, for she alone has malice to accomplish such a deed."
               "If I thought that," said De Vere, in a tone of concentrated feeling, "there is no
                  punishment that I would not mete out to her. I will write to her at once."
               
               The letter was written and despatched; days of darkness and despair passed over
                  the bereaved parents; the woman who had stolen the young heir was traced to
                  London, but there all clue to her was lost. Helen still persisted in the belief
                  that her cousin had caused her this anguish; she recalled her threats, and dwelt
                  upon them with such pertinacity that her husband and mother were half convinced
                  that she was right.
               A reply came from Alina, in which she indignantly and defiantly repelled the
                  charge. She ended with these words:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "In other days I may have felt aggrieved that my child
                              was not recognized as the lawful heir of his father; but now it is no
                              longer so. I am on the eve of marriage with a Russian nobleman of such
                              vast wealth as makes your petty income seem trifling in comparison. He
                              has pledged himself to adopt my little Lionel, and provide for him as
                              his own son. Why then should I have committed such a crime as this? at
                              a time, too, when such an accusation must seriously compromise the
                              brilliant future that is opening before me. I have powerful friends,
                              and I would advise you, Sir Reginald De Vere, to make no move in this
                              affair which can implicate me in the most remote manner.
                           "Seek your child, and find him, if you can do so, but do not suppose
                              that idle threats, uttered in a moment of passion, could have been
                              carried into effect in such a manner as this. I pity Helen for
                              thinking so meanly of her kinswoman; I forgive her for the injury she
                              has done me, and I hope this is the last communication we shall have
                              with each other.
                           
                              ALINA, COUNTESS DERVAL."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This letter did not entirely satisfy Sir Reginald, and he wrote to a friend in
                  Paris to have a constant espionage kept over the acts of its writer—to use every
                  effort to discover if his child was in her power, without permitting her to become
                  aware that she was an object of suspicion.
               This was accordingly done, but nothing was elicited; the strictest search also
                  failed in every other quarter, and although a large reward was constantly offered
                  for information concerning the lost heir, no clue was furnished.
               Helen faded day by day, until she became the mere shadow of her former self, and
                  De Vere was aroused from the indulgence of his own grief to the necessity of
                  traveling with her, and diverting her mind from the bitter regrets that filled it.
                  If the unhappy mother could have known that her child was in his grave, she might
                  have reconciled herself to his loss, but the uncertainty of his fate filled her
                  with ever renewed anguish.
               The happy home was broken up; Mrs. Fitzhugh went to her friends in France, Sir
                  Reginald and his wife, with their little girl, became wanderers on the face of the
                  earth; always seeking that which was lost, ever failing in their quest. In process
                  of time Helen regained her health, but her heart was ineffably sad, as days,
                  months, years rolled away, and no clue to her lost child was found.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               FATE WEAVING HER WEB.
               THE beautiful Comtesse Derval sat in her saloon in full toilette, with lights
                  blazing on the sumptuous scene it presented. The walls were nearly covered with
                  mirrors, and the floor looked as if a parterre of rare flowers, the hues of which
                  were magically blended, was spread upon its surface. Curtains, richly embroidered,
                  fell in heavy folds from the windows;
                  the cut glass chandelier sparkled in the light of the wax candles and the bright
                  fire that burned upon the hearth.
               Objects of art were scattered over the inlaid tables, and cold as the weather was,
                  exotics in full bloom stood on marble pedestals, placed on every available spot in
                  the room. A soft, voluptuous perfume filled the atmosphere, and Alina, in a green
                  velvet robe clasped with diamonds, her magnificent hair dressed without powder,
                  sat in a luxurious chair, looking as fair and lovely as in the days of her first
                  youth.
               Time seemed to have no power to change her, for her complexion was like marble,
                  her eyes as serenely beautiful as ever, and her smiling lips even more seductive
                  than in days of yore, for they had learned the syren art of flattery in all its
                  perfection.
               A thundering rap announced the arrival of visitors, and as Madame L'Estrange
                  entered through a side door, Alina arose, and moved forward to greet the guests
                  her servant announced.
               "The Comtesse La Motte, and his Eminence, the Cardinal de Rohan."
               The lady was still youthful, full of sprightly grace, and had that air of
                  fascination which is the birthright of many dangerous women. She was very fair,
                  with hair of intense blackness, on which a slight sprinkling of powder appeared.
                  Her graceful figure was clad in an exquisite toilette, and her voice rang out with
                  a clear metallic vibration as she advanced, with both hands extended, toward her
                  hostess, and said:
               "Dear Comtesse, here we are at last; such a time have we had getting over the
                  shocking road between this and Paris, that I almost despaired of arriving at all.
                  But Monseigneur was kind enough to bear me company, and to keep my spirits up on
                  the way."
               "I think the last assurance will bear reversing, Comtesse," said Rohan, with a
                  smile, after offering his courteous greeting to his hostess. "Without your bright
                  wit, and never flagging energies, I do not know how we would have fared. Really,
                  this weather is like Greenland; such a winter I have never seen."
               "And but for the benevolence of your Eminence, many would never have lived to see
                  it through," said the sweet voice of Madame Derval. "I have heard blessings
                  showered upon you by many grateful hearts."
               The cardinal almost blushed, and with a half smile said:
               "The blessings were due to another person, Comtesse, for I have only acted as the
                  almoner of a very powerful lady. Such was her wish, and like a loyal
                  subject, I obeyed. Give me no credit, for I deserve none."
               "Truly Monseigneur, you were highly honored by the queen," said Madame L'Estrange,
                  looking fixedly at him. He flushed, turned hastily toward her, and said:
               "I have not named so august a personage. Excuse me, Madame, but prudence is a
                  necessary virtue in courts."
               "But we are not at court now, Monseigneur: and surely among a few intimate
                  friends, we can afford to speak with freedom. Fear nothing for our indiscretion;
                  we shall not betray the gratuitous commission given you by her Majesty to assist
                  the poor in her name, till she can liquidate the debt she thus incurs. In the
                  meantime, her funds must accumulate to pay for the expensive bauble she has set
                  her heart on having."
               "Yes," said Madame La Motte, with sparkling eyes: "Boehmer is likely to sell his
                  necklace at last. He pretends that it is bargained for by a sultana, but we, who
                  are behind the scenes, know that she does not live in Turkey. Ha! ha!"
               The meaning laugh was echoed by the whole party, and they gathered around the blazing fire; its light
                  fell upon the stately figure of the prelate, revealing a handsome man of fifty,
                  well preserved for his age, though growing slightly corpulent with advancing
                  years. He had the gallant bearing of a courtier, and his dress was sumptuous, yet
                  in perfect taste.
               "Ah, Monseigneur, the Promenade de la rose must
                  be deserted during this terrible weather," said Madame Derval, with a sly smile,
                  which again called a flush to the cheek of the cardinal, but he quickly
                  answered:
               "Ah, Madame, the sacred flower from which it was named is enshrined in a golden
                  casket from which none of its precious aroma can escape. I inhale it as the breath
                  of Heaven, when I unclose it to look upon its faded leaves."
               "It is a breath that will waft you to the highest niche of power, Monseigneur; be
                  assured of that," said Madame L'Estrange, significantly. "The hand from which that
                  flower fell, will be regal in its reward to him who has dedicated himself to
                     her service, even in its caprices."
               "Ah, Madame," replied the cardinal, with assumed humility, "I only aspire to serve
                  the most gracious liege lady that mortal man ever claimed. But where is our
                  cabalistic friend—our soothsayer, for I expected to find him here before me?"
               "The bad roads have probably delayed Count Cagliostro; but he will certainly be
                  with us to-night," said Alina composedly. "I am expecting his arrival every
                  moment."
               In fact, at that instant the grating of carriage wheels was heard on the frozen
                  ground of the court yard, and in a few moments the celebrated philosopher,
                  physician, alchemist and consummate quack was announced.
               The door opened, and the flood of light fell upon the form of a middle-aged man of
                  commanding presence, whose eagle glance scanned the group that arose to greet his
                  entrance trance. There was a certain power in the face of Cagliostro, though at
                  the first view it was by no means attractive. His jaw was heavy; his nose slightly
                  retroussé, and his mouth sensual; but upon his low, broad brow, in the expression
                  of his face, was stamped the impress of indomitable will and shamelessness of
                  purpose that would have betrayed to a physiognomist the nature that dwelt within
                  that frame which he proclaimed to have been rejuvenated through countless ages of
                  time.
               Thus looked the charlatan who had the hardihood to have a medal struck with his
                  likeness upon it, under which was written the following lines: 
                     
                        "The friend of humanity, look on his traits,
                        All his days are marked by new benefits—
                        He prolongs life—he helps indigence,
                        The pleasure of being useful his sole recompense."
                     
                  
               
               Whether those who now arose to welcome him were impressed with a belief in the
                  supernatural powers Cagliostro claimed, is uncertain, but they all treated him
                  with the reverential respect due to a Grand Cophta, who had conferred upon each
                  one present the mystic degrees of his Egyptian lodge, and through whose agency
                  they hoped to gain future power and wealth.
               The credulous cardinal believed this was to be done through the trasnsmutation of
                  metals, or the cyrstalization of diamonds; and the other neophytes, through the
                  unscrupulous use of the means he might place in their hands. The Cardinal de Rohan
                  rich, powerful, and ambitious, little dreamed that he had been chosen as the
                  victim of these subtle conspirators, who played into each other's hands with a
                  skill that led him to the verge of ruin; which affixed to the name of a prince of
                  the church the disgraceful charge of theft, that ended in a long imprisonment and
                  shameful trial, from which he at last issued triumphantly, but with ruined fortune
                  and tarnished honor.
               
               Cagliostro bowed profoundly over the hands of the ladies, paying to each in
                  succession a happily turned compliment; for he was a thorough man of the world,
                  and knew how to play the part of the successful flatterer to the fairer part of
                  creation.
               "Ah, my dear count," said Madame Derval, with her most charming smile, "we were
                  just speaking of you, and hoping that no accident had delayed your arrival. I am
                  happy to see you safe among us."
               "And I assure you, comtesse, that I am very glad to exchange the icy atmosphere
                  without for this cheerful saloon, with lovely faces, and words of welcome, which
                  are deliciously grateful to me. I do not think, fair lady, that you will ever need
                  my magic elixir, for youth and grace seem to have marked you as their perennial
                  possessor."
               She laughed merrily.
               "Yet I should wish to possess the power to evade old age and wrinkles. I think I
                  must obtain some of that precious liquid, even if it is worth its weight in
                  diamonds."
               "Ah-h—we shall see—we shall see. You have some beautiful diamonds, Madame. Those
                  upon your bosom are very like some of the stones in Boehmer's celebrated necklece.
                  I am a judge of precious stones, and especially of diamonds, for I have had much
                  to do with them."
               "Yes, Monsieur; if rumor speaks the truth, the Count Cagliostro can transmute
                  common crystals into most radiant jewels. This parure was a present from my betrothed. They are family jewels which
                  have been reset for me, and should really not have been worn before our marriage;
                  but I wished you to see them this evening, and I thought it would be a delicate
                  compliment to the Baron to wear them on this occasion."
               "Then Maretsky will be here this evening, Madame?"
               "Assuredly—he spends every evening with me when I am at home. He dined with Madame
                  L'Estrange and myself, and is now with my little boy. He is very fond of Lionel,
                  as the child is also of him."
               "Ah! that must be a great satisfaction to you. Then the little Colombe is ready for our experiment?"
               "As ready as perfect innocence, combined with precocious intelligence, can render
                  him. He is wild to see the phantoms in the water which the Baron has promised him,
                  and half the day has been spent in looking through a glass globe containing my
                  gold fish, in the hope of seeing a picture arise in it."
               "Then he will not be alarmed, Madame? You have judiciously prepared him for his
                  wonderful task."
               "The Baron was kind enough to undertake that. I will ring, and cause him to be
                  informed of your arrival."
               Alina touched the enamelled bell-handle, and made a sign to the servant that
                  answered the summons. In a few seconds the doors, opening into an exquisitely
                  furnished boudoir, were thrown back, revealing a retreat as luxurious as Calypso
                  might have chosen. It was lighted by lamps covered with misty white shades,
                  through which soft, moonlit rays alone penetrated. In the centre of the floor
                  stood an oval table, the top of which was inlaid with precious stones in a mosaic
                  pattern. It was a miracle of art, and was one of the numerous gifts of the wealthy
                  Russian lover of the hostess.
               Upon this table was placed a large, crystal bowl, without flaw or speck, filled to
                  the brim with limpid water. Standing beside it was a tall, leonine-looking man,
                  whose high cheek bones, pale, blue eyes, and long, light hair, proclaimed his
                  northern origin. He was not without some pretensions to beauty, for his features
                  were clearly, though heavily cut, with an expression of good humor, mingled with
                  keenness, in the lines of his face.
               
               Mounted on a chair by his side was a tiny form dressed in a white tunic, over
                  which a pale blue scarf was bound across his breast, and a pair of artificial
                  wings were fastened to his shoulders. His dark curls were held back from his broad
                  clear brow by a wreath of immortelles, and his large dark eyes were bent earnestly
                  upon the water, for he had been taught to believe that forms would arise in it
                  which would be visible to him alone.
               The party in the outer apartment gazed a moment on this tableau, and then entered
                  the inner shrine, in which preparations had been made for the promised exhibition
                  of the necromancer's power. The Baron bowed with smiling ease at their approach,
                  and greeted the newly arrived guests.
               Cagliostro spoke in a low tone to Madame Derval. "Ah Madame la Comtesse, your son
                  is indeed a fitting representative of a cherub. A lovelier or more intelligent
                  looking child I have never seen."
               Alina regarded the boy with a triumphant smile; but there was little maternal
                  tenderness in its expression. She replied in the same tone:
               "He is docile, yet full of imagination. I think you will find him an
                  impressionable subject, for the Baron has ascertained that he can be magnetically
                  influenced."
               "It is not through magnetism that I shall now seek to act on him," replied
                  Cagliostro loftily. "Through the superior manifestations of the soul, unclouded by
                  earthly influences, this pure spirit shall speak."
               The listener bowed respectfully, though she was skeptical, and began dimly to
                  comprehend the agency through which the charlatan produced the extraordinary
                  results which were so widely spoken of in Paris. At that day magnetism was
                  scarcely known; Mesmer had thrown some light upon its mysteries, and he was then
                  in Paris performing cures, through its agency, which were declared to be
                  miraculous. By a dabbler in occult science like Cagliostro, its salient features
                  were at once seized on, and applied to his own purposes, without acknowledging the
                  source from which he derived his power. Not to magnetism would he attribute any of
                  the phenomena he produced, but to the direct agency of magic, which he claimed to
                  be exercised by himself alone.
               A circle of chairs was noislessly drawn around the table in which the expectant
                  enquirers placed themselves; for each one on that evening had been promised a
                  glimpse into the future, and they all awaited the revelations of the seer with
                  impatience mingled with a slight feeling of awe, for Cagliostro possessed a
                  strange power to influence those who were thrown within the circle of his
                  spells.
               At a sign from Cagliostro, the Baron placed himself between Alina and Madame
                  L'Estrange, while Rohan separated his fair hostess on the other side from Madame
                  La Motte. The bright, sparkling eyes of the latter were busily engaged in noting
                  all she saw, drawing her own inferences, and maturing, in her busy and scheming
                  brain, those plans which were leading her on to ruin and disgrace. She claimed
                  descent from the house of Valois, and enjoyed a small pension from the King; but
                  all her efforts had proved unavailing to gain her an introduction at court.
               The Queen steadily refused to see her, although she led her willing dupe, the
                  Cardinal de Rohan, to believe that she was in constant communication with her
                  majesty, and was entrusted by her with communications for the prelate. The
                  stupendous fraud of the diamond necklace was then progressing toward its
                  completion, and every one in that room, save Rohan and the child, was fully
                  cognizant of all that had been done, and what yet remained to do, to transfer it
                  from the unhappy Cardinal to the harpies who were seeking to prey upon his life
                  and fortune.
               In disgrace at court for the last fifteen years, madly desirous sirous of being reinstated in favor, he imagined
                  that the everlasting gratitude of the Queen would be gained by the purchase of
                  this unique necklace at the cost of a million and a half of livres. He insanely
                  believed that it would be accepted, and the place of minister be given to him as
                  an equivalent for its value.
               The perfidious La Motte found a woman who bore a sufficient likeness to the Queen,
                  to personate her at night in the park of Versailles, and in that nocturnal
                  interview, the rose which Rohan had so jealously guarded, was thrown to him at the
                  moment of parting. At his episcopal palace at Savergne, the deluded Cardinal named
                  a retired avenue the Promenade de la Rose, and
                  when there, spent many hours in dreaming on the future distinctions that awaited
                  him.
               On this evening, he hoped to gain such knowledge of the future as would enable him
                  to see his course plainly before him, and he sat gravely and nervously awaiting
                  the promised revelations.
               In placing the party, Cagliostro had been careful that there should be some point
                  of contact between them, and with the child between himself and Madame L'Estrange,
                  a circle was formed sufficiently near to maintain the magnetic influence around
                  the point of interest.
               He then drew some cabalistic signs upon the surface of the table, uttered an
                  incantation in an unintelligible language, and passed his hands above the head of
                  the child, who had remained silent and impassive since they entered. A nervous
                  shudder pervaded Lionel's frame, his features became fixed, and in a few moments
                  his eyes half closed. The enchanter looked earnestly in his face, faintly smiled,
                  and touching his eye-lids, spoke in French:
               "Unclose your luminous orbs, child of innocence and truth, and interpret the
                  visions which shall arise before you."
               Obedient to his commands, the heavy eye-lids lifted, the boy's eyes were fixed in
                  a strange stare upon the bowl of water, and Cagliostro grasped his hand in one of
                  his own, while with the other he waved a small magnetic wand, which he drew from
                  his bosom, over the fluid in the bowl. In a deep, imposing voice he then said:
               "Prophet of Fate, what do you behold?"
               The other actors in the scene saw that bubbles of air were beginning to rise
                  rapidly toward the surface of the water, and in a strange mechanical tone the
                  child began to speak in the language of a person far more mature than himself;
                  thus proving the clairvoyant state into which he had been thrown by his skilful
                  manipulator.
               "Ah, the pictures have come at last! There they are, so beautiful—so
                  enchanting."
               "Tell us, then, what you see."
               "There is a grand saloon, in which is a crowd of gay people. I see a noble looking
                  man in the robes of a Cardinal, who bows before a stately looking woman, who wears
                  upon her bosom the most beautiful rainbow; but it flashes brighter than the one in
                  the sky, for it is made of priceless jewels. The lady gives the prelate her hand
                  to kiss, and congratulates him on his appointment as Minister of State."
               The child had uttered this slowly, and with some apparent effort; he now paused,
                  seemed to regain his natural state, and looked around him with an expression of
                  surprise.
               "The oracle has spoken," said Cagliostro, with a triumphant glance at Rohan. "You
                  have heard the decree of Fate from the lips of my Colombe, and I trust that you no
                  longer doubt your future fortunes, Monseigneur?"
               The face of the Cardinal had flushed, and then grown pale, while the child was
                  speaking; but now they wore an expression of radiant happiness, and he fervently
                  said:
               
               "Thanks!—thanks! I no longer hesitate. The jewels shall be sent to her majesty
                  without further delay. I have feared that she would refuse to accept them, or they
                  would have been offered before. If Madame La Motte will still continue to act as
                  my ambassadress, to her care they shall be confided."
               The piquant features of the lady referred to, wore their most enchanting smile as
                  she replied:
               "Command me, Monseigneur, and you shall find me now, as ever, your most faithful
                  servant and friend, if I may presume to claim that title toward him who is about
                  to soar to the pinnacle of power."
               The prelate gallantly lifted her jewelled hand to his lips, and said:
               "As my truest and best friend, I am proud to claim you, Madame; and, when the
                  power is mine, I will prove to you, that a Rohan knows how to be grateful."
               A glance of intelligence passed between the other actors in this scene, and, after
                  caressing her son, Alina said:
               "Since the fortune of his Eminence is assured, let the enchanter wield his magic
                  wand, and show my friend the Baron what his future is to be."
               Cagliostro smiled affably.
               "When a man is about to grasp the rose of happiness, Madame, it seems superfluous
                  to ask anything of Fate: but, since you desire it, the future shall be unrolled
                  before your friend."
               "Such is his wish, and it is also mine."
               Lionel had been receiving the caresses of Madame La Motte, who declared him a
                  divine love; but, at the summons of the wizard, he turned at once to him, and,
                  with the same serious gravity as before, submitted to the manipulations which were
                  to endue him with the magic power of prevision.
               Again he stood before them with his features colorless and rigid, his large black
                  eyes looking fixedly in the water, while his hands were clasped upon his breast,
                  which heaved convulsively as if a heavy weight was pressing upon it. Again the
                  cabalistic wand waved above the bowl, and the same phenomena as before were
                  visible. He suddenly burst into a joyful shout—
               "I see them! I see them! Oh, the beautiful horses! how they prance and shake their
                  long manes! Ah! there is one grander than all the others; he is black
                  as night itself, his eyes flash with fire, and he paws the earth in his pride. His
                  bridle is inlaid with gold and glitters with precious stones. A man in livery
                  holds him—ha! ha! it is the same worn by the servants of our dear Baron. Ah! here
                  he comes himself, to mount, followed by a score of gentlemen. They are preparing
                  for the hunt; yes—to hunt the wolves that infest the steppes, for it is a Russian
                  scene that I describe."
               There was a pause, and the boy resumed:
               "Now the court-yard widens; the walls of a great castle become visible, and in the
                  grand entrance hall I see the Baron in splendid robes, receiving messengers from
                  the Empress, who bring him his commission as governor of the province in which his
                  hereditary estates are situated. The great Catherine also sends him the order of
                  the Black Eagle as the reward of important services rendered to her. Ah, the Baron
                  will be a powerful and successful man; he will rise high—higher, till he gains the
                  culminating point of his career. His life will also be blessed in the love of a
                  fair woman, who will sympathize with his ambition and aid him to gain the prizes
                  of life."
               "It is wonderful!" said Maretsky. "Lionel has described my Arab courser, Abdallah,
                  that I left behind me with so much regret. He has also foretold the fulfilment of the most secret aspirations of my
                  heart. Verily a miracle has been performed before our eyes."
               Alina cast a bewitching glance upon him, and he stealthily pressed her hand, as he
                  whispered:
               "Your cherub has shown you the future which I invite you to share with me. Does it
                  satisfy your ambition? does it open a sphere worthy of your transcendent beauty
                  and talents?"
               "I am satisfied—I am happy, for I love you," she breathed into his ear, and a
                  glance of deep meaning was exchanged between them.
               While this by-play passed, Cagliostro removed the influence from the boy; he
                  raised his head with some effort, and faintly said:
               "Give me some water; I am sick."
               A glass of water was hastily held to his lips, and, after drinking a small
                  portion, he seemed to revive.
               Madame La Motte said:
               "And now my turn comes. Pray, M. le Compte, be as generous toward me as you have
                  been to these two gentlemen. Though a woman, I am ambitious; I should like to
                  mount to the empyrean on a golden cloud. Ah, if I only had money
                  enough, I could manage all the rest."
               "Doubtless, Madame; to one of your tact, nothing is impossible, when once the way
                  is opened before you. But the child seems faint and exhausted; it will be better
                  to defer your fortunes to another sitting."
               An expression of such keen disappointment veiled her features, that Madame Derval
                  hastened to say:
               "Lionel seems quite restored; give him a little wine, and he will be able to
                  oblige Madame La Motte without injury to himself."
               "No, Madame," said Cagliostro. "So mundane a thing as wine must not touch his lips
                  in an experiment like this. Since you are willing to try him further, I will give
                  him just four drops of my Life-Elixir, one for each year he has lived, and that
                  will renew his strength."
               "Do so, if it will benefit him," said his mother, calmly.
               Cagliostro took from his pocket a small crystal vial, with a gold casing over the
                  stopper. From this he poured a minute quantity of the limpid liquid it contained
                  into a Bohemian glass, and diluted it with water. The child demurred a little to
                  swallowing it, but the will of the conjuror overpowered his feeble resistance in a
                  few moments, and he drank the potion.
               The light returned to his eyes, a bright rose bloomed upon his lately colorless
                  cheeks, and he clapped his hands in childish glee. These manifestations were
                  suddenly stopped by the waving of Cagliostro's hand, and again he assumed the
                  rigid immobility which was necessary to the performance of the part assigned him.
                  Madame La Motte clasped her hands, and with lips half apart, sat in an attitude of
                  intense solicitude.
               "Madame," said Cagliostro, abruptly, "the child has been long enough in this
                  unnatural condition. Ask a single question, and I will get a reply for you; beyond
                  that, I do not think it will be safe to go."
               An expression of keen disappointment crossed her face, and she said:
               "I hope to hear much more than that; but since it must be so, I will do as you bid
                  me. Tell me if I shall succeed in my present enterprise, and meet with all the
                  brilliant results I hope from it?"
               "Ah, Madame, you have already asked two questions; to the first,
                  perhaps, I can get an answer; as to the last, I will see."
               At the motion of the wand the bubbles began slowly to arise, and in a faint,
                  far-off voice the child murmured:
               
               "It is done—the glittering prize is won; but a tornado is rising—a sea of blood
                  flows upward; ah! the water changes into blood!"
               His tones suddenly arose almost to a shriek, his body violently convulsed, and in
                  his agitation he grasped the wand of the magician, and struck it sharply against
                  the edge of the bowl. It parted in two pieces, and sent the water flowing over the
                  table.
               There was a simultaneous rising and drawing back to escape the deluge, and while
                  Cagliostro restored the boy to his natural state, Alina rang for her servants to
                  repair the damage that had been done.
               The party returned to the larger room, the doors were again closed, and a gay
                  discussion held on the sitting which had just taken place. Lionel recovered his
                  usual sprightliness, and after being caressed by those he had served, and having
                  accepted the beautiful presents they had brought for him, he was sent away to his
                  nurse before the exquisite supper was served, with its champagne and wines of
                  cypress.
               Till a late hour the revellers sat over the table, and all, except Madame La
                  Motte, were in the highest spirits. She could not entirely comprehend the answer
                  that had been given to her, and toward the close of the entertainment she sought
                  an opportunity to speak with Cagliostro.
               "I shall succeed, it seems, but what means the vision of blood? I hope it is not
                     my blood that is to flow."
               "Yours, fair Comtesse? oh, no—'tis that of the million. A great
                  revolution is about to dawn; I hear its mutterings, I see the red cloud of destiny
                  looming before me; but you will be safe."
               "Thanks for the assurance, for I began to tremble in anticipation of—I know not
                  what."
               "You can shelter yourself in your well-lined nest easily enough. A woman who, by
                  her own wit, will secure what you have so adroitly gained, surely deserves to
                  enjoy the fruits of her labor."
               She raised her finger warningly, for the Cardinal was approaching them.
               "If we intend to get back to Paris before day dawns, we had better take our leave
                  at once," said Rohan. "We have had a charming evening, which we shall long
                  remember."
               "When you are Minister, I hope you will remember it," replied Cagl
                  iostro, significantly, and the three hastened to bid adieu to Madame Derval and
                  her companion. Baron Maretsky also took leave, whispering to Alina that in one
                  more week he would set out with her for the magnificent castle her child had
                  described. She pressed his hand, raised her expressive eyes to his face, and
                  said:
               "Yes—we shall be happy there."
               When all were gone, and even Madame L'Estrange, too tired to talk, left her alone,
                  Alina sank into the luxurious depths of a velvet-cushioned chair and reviewed her
                  position, which it is necessary to state.
               Through her own unscrupulous nature, and the intriguing spirit of her companion,
                  she had become entangled in the fraud that was on the eve of consummation. But
                  with all her want of principle, Alina could not think of participating in an
                  absolute theft without a pang of pride at being so deeply lowered.
               Madame La Motte could not gain admittance to the court, and it became necessary to
                  communicate with the Queen through some one who could approach her. At the command
                  of Madame L'Estrange, Alina became ostensibly that agent; though Marie Antoinette
                  never saw the missives that were entrusted to her hands, or heard from her lips
                  the sound of the Cardinal de Rohan's name. She was much too politic to hazard her
                  own favor in such a manner.
               
               Messages pricked on paper with a pin were despatched to him in the Queen's name,
                  which were manufactured by L'Estrange herself, to deceive the Countess La Motte,
                  for in this nefarious transaction each party made a dupe of the other
                  concerned.
               A Russian Baron, a former friend of Madame L'Estrange, appeared on the scene. He
                  professed a passionate desire to possess Boehmer's necklace, and he would have
                  bargained for it at once, but alas! it was already promised to royalty itself, and
                  no chance remained to gain it but by strategem.
               He joined the plotters, promising to give them an equivalent for it, partly in
                  money, partly in diamonds of smaller size, that could be more conveniently
                  disposed of. His offer was eagerly accepted, and the husband of Madame La Motte
                  was summoned from his regiment to Versailles. He was seen by Rohan in the livery
                  of the Queen parting from his wife in the park which surrounds the royal domain;
                  thus the Cardinal was prepared to recognise him as a servant of Marie Antoinette's
                  and to deliver into his hands his casket with its precious contents. Of the booty,
                  half a million was to be divided between Madame L'Estrange and her protégeé; twice
                  that amount to fall into the hands of Cagliostro and Madame La Motte.
               The Russian soon became passionately enamored of the fascinating Madame Derval,
                  and fully impressed with a belief in his high position and great wealth, in spite
                  of his complicity in the contemplated fraud, Alina accepted the offer of his
                  hand.
               They were to be married on the day the necklace was placed in his possession in
                  exchange for the jewels and money he was to give, and in possession of his coveted
                  prize, they were to set out for Russia.
               Maretsky had taken such precautions, that even if the other actors in the drama
                  were seized and tried, he would not be implicated; and the Baron assured
                  Cagliostro and the Countess La Motte that if his name, or that of his future wife,
                  was implicated, he would reveal the facts, return the necklace, and thus ensure
                  their destruction. Their object was to swindle the Cardinal de Rohan of a large
                  sum of money; that of Maretsky, as he set it forth, to gain possession of a jewel
                  on which he had set his heart.
               The Cardinal, with a facility that is almost incredible, permitted himself to be
                  victimized; a few weeks after the meeting at Madame Derval's, M. La Motte appeared
                  at his Hotel with a forged receipt from the Queen, the necklace was delivered to
                  him, and from that hour could never be traced.
               The actors dispersed to their several destinations; Cagliostro and Madame La Motte
                  remained at Paris, while their agents went to England and Holland to dispose of
                  the diamonds given them by Maretsky in lieu of those he received. The marriage of
                  Maretsky and the Countess Derval was celebrated in private, and accompanied by her
                  companion and her child, she was whirled away toward unknown regions, her heart
                  filled with ambitious dreams of the future, while her new lord exulted in the
                  possession of his beautiful bride and the coveted necklace, for the first of which
                  a price of blood had been exacted.
               Alina had pursued Rudolph with untiring hatred. He entered the French army, and
                  soon distinguished himself by his gallantry and daring; but she kept a spy
                  constantly upon his steps, and many times his life was attempted, but in every
                  instance his unflinching courage baffled his assassins.
               Despairing of success by her own unaided efforts to effect his destruction, she
                  pledged her hand to her powerful lover if he would rid her of her enemy. The story
                  she partially fabricated interested Maretsky; he believed she had been sufficiently injured to demand this
                  atonement, and he entered into her views without scruple. The pledge was given,
                  and he fully believed it had been redeemed, for he took such measures as resulted
                  in a certificate being sent to him from a town on the Rhine, where Rudolph was
                  then stationed, in which it was stated that Sergeant Michel was killed in the tent
                  of his commanding officer, on the eighth of March, by an unknown person, who fired
                  on him as he was speaking to the captain of his troop; the ball entered his
                  breast, and he fell dead.
               Thus this hard and cruel woman went on her way, believing that she had forever rid
                  herself of the man she had so deeply injured.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               THE ASSASSINATION.
               BEFORE leaving Paris, Rudolph ascertained that a corps of partizans, whose service
                  was of the most daring nature, was attached to the army of the Rhine. In this he
                  volunteered, and assumed the uniform of a French hussar.
               When he joined his new companions, a murmur of surprise greeted him, and one of
                  them spoke aloud:
               "Eh bien! but the likeness is most wonderful; I
                  could almost believe that you are the captain himself."
               "Who, then, is this captain whom I so strongly resemble?" he asked, with a
                  smile.
               "Captain Ney, and a gallant officer, as you will soon find, for he is our
                  commander."
               The name struck on his ear, and caused him to start slightly, for it was the one
                  borne by his mother before her marriage, and he eagerly asked:
               "From what department does Captain Ney come?"
               "From Sarre Louis, comrade; and his father is a good citizen of that place."
               Rudolph turned away satisfied that there was good reason for the resemblance, for
                  the officer under whom he was about to serve, was the son of his mother's only
                  brother. Since the emigration of Mr. Rudolph, little intercourse had been kept up
                  between the two families, and the new recruit felt perfectly secure in his
                  incognito.
               Rudolph first saw his new commander on parade, and he was startled by the perfect
                  resemblance that existed between them. Had they been dressed alike, no eye could
                  have distinguished between them, for no twin brothers were ever more perfect
                  counterparts of each other.
               The eye of the captain fell on the erect figure with its soldierly bearing, and he
                  started as he recognized the soldier of whom he had already been told. He reined
                  up his horse in front of him, and asked:
               "Who are you? Whence do you come?"
               "My name is Michel, and I am from the vicinity of Havre."
               "Have you before served?"
               "Yes, my captain. In the United States."
               "Ah, ah! one of La Fayette's heroes. Well, my lad, you have fought the battle of
                  freedom, now you will have different, but not less glorious work to do. Show what
                  mettle you are made of, in our wild corps, and if I find you deserving, I will
                  look after you myself."
               "Thanks, my captain; I will endeavor to prove myself worthy of your kindness."
               The captain galloped away, looking back, and marvelling at the singular
                  resemblance to himself borne by this stranger. That evening he summoned Rudolph to
                  his tent, and questioned him as to his former life; but he was very careful to give no clue to the tie of blood
                  that existed between them. His incognito he was determined to preserve, and the
                  name under which he had entered the army, he trusted would secure him from further
                  machinations on the part of Alina, but her spy had never lost sight of him from
                  the night she recognized him at the theatre to the present moment.
               Before he left Paris, Rudolph was attacked by three men in a retired street at a
                  late hour of the night. He defended himself against such desperate odds, till a
                  carriage accidentally approached, from which a cavalier sprang to the assistance
                  of the single man he saw contending against so many assailants. The ruffians ran
                  off, and after warmly thanking his preserver, who refused to give his name,
                  Rudolph returned to his lodgings in safety, though every step he took was watched
                  by one who was well paid to play the spy upon him.
               Three days afterward, Rudolph left Paris for the frontier, and joined the corps to
                  which he belonged. No bloodhound ever more faithfully tracked the steps of his
                  victim, than did Jacques those of the man whose life he had pledged himself to
                  take; and Alina joined in the fêtes at court, or reposed in her luxurious home at
                  La Rosière, with the certainty that this time the assassin would not fail to
                  perform his errand.
               Jacques became a follower of the camp, and matured his plans at his leisure; yet,
                  by some fortuitous circumstance, they were always baffled. Providence seemed to
                  watch over the life which had been destined to so noble a future in the grand
                  panorama of events which was slowly unrolling itself.
               In the four years that followed Rudolph's entrance into the army, his life had
                  many times been attempted by the miscreant who had sworn to take it, but the
                  bravery and reckless daring of the intended victim, saved him each time, and in
                  the last encounter, the brigand was himself slain.
               When this news reached Alina, she became desperate. She made her compact with
                  Maretsky, and he pledged himself to have the obnoxious hussar removed without
                  danger to himself or her.
               Rudolph had been constantly in active service since he joined his regiment, and
                  the great personal bravery he displayed, his perfect coolness in the hour of
                  peril, combined with strict sobriety and excellent judgment, soon recommended him
                  to the notice of his superior officers. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant,
                  but he felt that his previous experience, and his habits as a commander, fitted
                  him for a much higher position than he could hope to win in the French army as it
                  was then organized; but he saw a brighter dawning; the people were about to assert
                  their power, and in the new order of things, he might hope to rise to the position
                  for which nature had designed him.
               With these aspirations in his soul, he was one evening summoned to the captain's
                  tent: this had become an event of frequent occurrence, for Ney found so much
                  intelligence, such indomitable hardihood in his double, that he had conceived not
                  only a great respect for his talents, but a strong attachment for him as a friend
                  in whom he could trust, in spite of the difference in their rank.
               A conversation of some length ensued, on the forays they had made, and those they
                  contemplated making, and a daring plan of attack on the outposts of the enemy was
                  concerted between them. They pledged each other to their success in wine, and as
                  they stood opposite each other, a sudden whim seized Ney, and he said:
               "I should like to see you in my uniform, Michel. Let us exchange coats, that I may
                  see if I should know you from myself."
               
               "It is getting late," said Rudolph, laughing, "and in place of playing this wild
                  prank, we had better separate in time to sleep a few hours before the reveille is
                  beaten."
               "No; I have long wished to see how perfect the resemblance between us is; besides,
                  I wish to play a trick on some one."
               "Not a serious one, I hope, captain?"
               "No—no—a mere joke; your dignity shall not be compromised. Take off your coat—here
                  is mine."
               The young officer threw toward him the garment as he spoke, and having no resource
                  but obedience, the sergeant gave his in exchange. In a few moments the
                  transformation was complete, and Ney exclaimed:
               "I declare it is myself before me. Your voice is even like mine, and Navine will
                  never know the difference. I shall surely win my wager."
               What that wager was, or how to be won, was destined never to be known, for at that
                  instant the sharp report of a pistol was heard, and the speaker fell pierced to
                  the heart by a ball sped from a practised hand.
               It was afterwards found that the assassin had made his way to the rear of the
                  tent, pierced a hole in the canvas, and deliberately taken aim at the person he
                  mistook for Rudolph.
               There was a sudden rush of feet at the sound of the shot; many voices asked how
                  this had occurred, and with his unfailing presence of mind, Rudolph answered
                  clearly, and directed the search for the murderer. His discharged pistol was found
                  on the ground near the spot from which it had been fired, and the hole in the
                  canvas bore witness to the truth of Rudolph's statement: the encampment was soon
                  in a state of great excitement, but the perpetrator of the deed was nowhere to be
                  found.
               During the whole of this time, the men addressed Rudolph as their captain, for
                  they thought their comrade had perished. Suddenly the thought flashed upon him
                  that now he had it in his power completely to evade his enemies, and at the same
                  time secure such a position as would open to him a fair field for the talents he
                  possessed. Ney was his cousin; he had won his own position; he owned neither
                  family, nor fortune, then why hesitate to constitute himself his heir, since all
                  he would gain thereby would be the military rank of which he could make such good
                  use? Why should he not seize this opportunity which Fate itself seemed to have
                  placed in his hands?
               With that rapidity of action which ever characterized him, Rudolph decided at
                  once, and as Captain Ney he returned to the tent, and issued his orders. The
                  habits of life of the deceased were intimately known to him, and there was little
                  difficulty in maintaining the character he had assumed. Indeed, in a few weeks he
                  almost forgot that it was not his own, though his brother officers marvelled at
                  the sudden display of abilities they had scarcely suspected Ney of possessing.
               His corps consisted of five hundred partizans whose duty it was to reconnoitre the
                  position of the enemy, and cut off their convoys; to this arduous and perilous
                  service the new captain gave all the energies, both mental and physical, that he
                  possessed. Daunted by no difficulties—deterred by no toils, deceived by no
                  strategem, at the head of his gallant band of warriors, Ney, as we shall
                  henceforth call our hero, acquired the title of the Indefatigable. His rise was
                  rapid and certain; and his popularity among his men was unbounded.
               Then commenced that series of brilliant exploits which caused Napoleon to say of
                  him at St. Helena that he was the bravest man he ever saw. Those who beheld him in
                  the hour of peril, with cannon crashing around him, sabres flashing on every side, and death in its most
                  fearful form, mowing down thousands before him, were struck with the iron calmness
                  with which he issued his orders, always seeing the right point of attack, and
                  seizing the moment in which it would be successful.
               His indifference to life was marvellous to lookers on, for they could not see how
                  deeply the iron had entered into his soul, nor comprehend that the soldier's death
                  upon the battle-field was the fate that would have been most welcome to him. His
                  tree of life has been struck at the root, its blossoms withered, and its fruits
                  turned to ashes in his grasp, and now he only asked the warrior's fame, the
                  warrior's grave. But a charmed life seemed to be his, for amid the storm of
                  bullets, in the thickest of the fight, all passed him scathless by.
               In his new career there was but one regret: he must relinquish the friends he
                  valued, and be to them as one dead.
               He had frequently visited the Chateau de St. Angeau since he first became
                  acquainted with its inmates, and a strong attachment bound him to them. The little
                  Aglaë had won for herself a warm place in his heart, and young as the child was,
                  she seemed to adore her preserver.
               Now they, like others, must believe that he had perished by the hand of the
                  assassin, for it was imperatively necessary to maintain his secret, and the letter
                  was dispatched which announced to M. St. Angeau that his friend Michel was no
                  more.
               Bitter was the grief it occasioned at the chateau, and Aglaë fell ill, and
                  languished so long that her parents were compelled to leave their beloved retreat,
                  and take her to the baths of Plombières. With great care she recovered her health,
                  but the elasticity of childhood seemed gone forever. She would sit and dream for
                  hours without speaking, and after her return home she was often found kneeling
                  before the picture of her lost friend, praying for the repose of his soul.
               "Maman," she one day said to her mother, "now
                  Michel is gone from me, I never intend to marry any one; when I am a young lady, I
                  will have no lovers."
               "But, my darling, Michel was much older than you are, and if he had lived, you
                  would probably have changed your mind when you grew up, and have selected some one
                  nearer your own age."
               "Oh, no—I love only him; I would have married only him; and now he has gone to
                  Heaven. I will try and make myself good enough to get there too."
               The mother kissed her with a tearful smile, fully impressed with the belief that
                  this fantasy of the little girl would pass away; but it did not. As years rolled
                  on, and the sweet child bloomed into the lovely maiden, she kept her word, for no
                  lover's vow was permitted to fall upon her ear, and her nightly orisons were
                  performed before the portrait of him whose lineaments thus remained indelibly
                  imprinted on her heart.
               One other duty remained to Ney: he remembered the pledge he had given to Col.
                  Calvert and his daughter, to send them some token of his prosperous fortunes.
                  Recalling the flattering reception once given him at the Hall, he drew a picture
                  of a laurel wreath through which a spear was passed, and writing beneath it, "All
                  is well with me," took pains to ensure its safe transmission to the hands for
                  which it was designed.
               It reached Dora on a calm autumn evening, when she watched beside the couch of her
                  dying father, for Col. Calvert's failing health had at last quite given way, and
                  he calmly awaited the approach of the grim conqueror, his only care or regret in
                  that hour being the lonely condition in which he must leave his daughter.
               
               The veteran was propped up in his bed, and the evening sunlight streamed through
                  the open windows into the apartment, lighting up the wasted face and failing eyes
                  of the departing man. Dora sat beside him, holding his chilling hands in both her
                  own; he spoke with effort:
               "The last hour approaches, and the one strong desire of my heart has not been
                  gratified. I hoped before I died to hear from my young hero, for such a man as
                  Rudolph will never suffer a faithless woman to destroy his career. He will win
                  honor and fame—I know it, and should you ever have the opportunity, Dora, tell him
                  that I said this with my dying breath."
               "I will, dearest father; but do not speak of dying; I cannot bear it; I shall be
                  alone in this wide world when you are gone."
               "Poor child! It is a sad fate; but God is good: He has promised to care for the
                  fatherless, and to Him I must commit you, my one ewe lamb. Has father Jerome come
                  yet? My time is short, and I would receive the last sacraments of the church
                  before I go hence."
               "He has been summoned," sobbed Dora, "and he will soon be here."
               As she spoke, a low tap upon the door announced the presence of the priest, and he
                  entered with a letter in his hand. After greeting the father and daughter, he
                  said:
               "Here is a letter from abroad, which was sent to the Archbishop in Baltimore, and
                  was forwarded thence to be delivered to you, sir."
               "From abroad! Then it must be from Rudolph. He has found his true place, and he
                  writes to tell me of his prosperity. Hurry, Dora, and read me its contents, while
                  I have yet the power to comprehend them."
               With trembling fingers Dora broke the seal, and an expression of blank
                  disappointment appeared on her face as she gazed on the contents of the paper. She
                  faintly said:
               "It is not a letter, father: he has sent us only what he promised; a token that he
                  has found a proper theatre of action, with a few words written beneath it."
               "Show it to me; hold it near, that my failing eyes may see the lines traced by my
                  dear boy's hand."
               Dora placed the open page before him; he grasped it with his trembling fingers,
                  and held it near his face. He breathed:
               "Thank God, the noble lad is in his true element."
               His eyes fell upon his daughter, and in heart-rending accents he exclaimed:
               "Oh, that it might have been! but Fate willed otherwise. Come, father, I must make
                  ready for my departure; I only waited to receive this assurance of the well-being
                  of one I love as a son."
               The priest indeed saw that no time was to be lost, for the pallor of approaching
                  death was stamped upon the features before him; and he hastened to administer the
                  last rites of the church to the sinking man. His worldly arrangements were already
                  made, and nothing now remained to do, but to make his final peace with heaven, and
                  yield his brave soul to Him who gave it.
               Dora's future was already marked out. She had decided to enter a convent for a
                  season, and prepare herself for the duties of a sister of charity, as she wished
                  to devote herself to the succor of the needy and helpless. A few thousand dollars,
                  from the wreck of the estate, were secured to her, and in the life she intended to
                  embrace they would suffice for all her wants.
               Dora did not intend to take such vows as would cramp her freedom of action, or
                  take from herself the control of her small fortune. She merely wished to enrol
                  herself among those who devote themselves to good works, with the power to select
                  her own field of action, and to move whither her own will or the current of events
                  should lead her.
               
               This had been arranged for her by Father Jerome with the hope that she would
                  eventually take the veil in the house into which she was to be received; but this
                  was far from her intention. The one hope of her life was to look on Rudolph once
                  more; to learn whither he had gone, and to keep herself informed of what might
                  befall him. In his tumultuous career, he might need her services in time to come;
                  she felt the assurance that he would do so, and as sister, friend, or nurse, she
                  must be upon the spot to render such assistance as he would require at her
                  hands.
               That night Col. Calvert died, and was laid to rest in the vault of his
                  forefathers. The old servants were provided for, and after parting from them, and
                  from the home of her youth, with many tears, Dora accompanied Father Jerome to
                  Baltimore, where she entered a religious establishment, presided over by a lady
                  she had known from her childhood. Here her wounded heart found peace, but not
                  content; as her grief subsided for the loss she had sustained, the yearning desire
                  to fulfil her self-imposed misson gained strength with every passing day. She
                  devoted every leisure hour to the acquisition of such a knowledge of the French
                  language as would enable her to speak it perfectly. With the assistance of a nun
                  from Paris, who was in the convent, she accomplished this, and then made her
                  arrangements to leave her native land, probably forever.
               War desolated Europe, and nurses must always be in demand. Dora sought and
                  obtained the means of crossing the Atlantic with a party destined to such service,
                  and few who looked upon the pale and placid face of sister Therése, could have
                  recognized in her the impulsive Dora Calvert of other days.
               Time and suffering had tamed the fire of her nature, and now a deep and yearning
                  desire to do good for its own sake, was the governing spirit of her chastened
                  soul. But beneath this lay the one fond wish which was truly the central hope of
                  her being—to behold Rudolph once more, to learn whither Fate had borne him, and if
                  it might be, to serve him in that crisis of his life which she felt assured would
                  arise.
               This presentiment took almost the form of faith, and this sustained her through
                  years of wandering and hardship before a clue was gained to the whereabouts of him
                  she so faithfully sought. Fortunately she did not hear the story of his supposed
                  death, for that would have struck her hopes to the earth at once, and sent her to
                  the last earthly refuge of the weary and broken-hearted—the convent's cell.
               Before her departure from the hall, Dora sent a copy of Rudolph's token to his
                  father, and that was the only news he ever received of the lost one. But he, and
                  others who had known Michael Rudolph, watched the rise of Michael Ney in Europe,
                  with the belief that he who had won fame in their own struggle for freedom, and
                  this gallant young partisan, distinguished by the same traits, was one and the
                  same person.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               THE REIGN OF TERROR.
               THE reign of terror was desolating France. It had reached its culminating point in
                  the destruction of the King, the Queen, and finally, in the fall of the Girondins.
                  Robespierre, the incarnation of cruelty and sombre pride, reigned supreme over the
                  bloody orgies of the Jacobins. Death, clothed in garments dripping with gore,
                  stalked through the unhappy land, immolating all that brought back a souvenir of the past; the ruler seeking to
                  establish that chimera, the equality of men, through the only means left to him,
                  the action of the guillotine. Death brings the monarch and the beggar to the same
                  level; and by the inexorable decree of the million, the descendant of St. Louis
                  shared the fate of his meanest subjects.
               In Paris, in the second story of a house which overlooked an open square filled
                  with trees, were three persons. A gentleman of thirty-five, of striking appearance
                  and noble physiognomy, walked up and down the floor with quick, restless steps. He
                  wore the plain garb of an English traveler, and an expression of wearing anxiety
                  rested on his features. A lady in a gray robe sat near the window, looking pale
                  and excited, and in the slender form, colorless face, and almost transparent
                  hands, few persons would have recognized the gay and buoyant Helen Fitzhugh, who
                  had stood at the altar with Sir Reginald De Vere but a few years since, in the
                  pride of her youth and beauty.
               Their daughter, a slender, delicate child, glanced from one parent to the other,
                  with an air of timid questioning, and the expression of premature care on her fair
                  features, proved that she too suffered from the cloud that ever hung as an incubus
                  over the hearts of those she loved; and of late this cloud had deepened and
                  darkened until it threatened to close as a pall around them.
               De Vere and his wife had ventured into the lion's den, in the hope of rescuing
                  Mrs. Fitzhugh from the remorseless guillotine. After a long absence from their
                  home, they returned to the castle to meet upon its threshold the information that
                  Mrs. Fitzhugh was in imminent danger of arrest; that her friends had concealed
                  themselves; and she was in Paris, under such strict surveillance that she dare not
                  attempt to escape.
               To save one they both loved from the fate that menaced her, Sir Reginald and Helen
                  were willing to risk their own safety. He wished to go to Paris alone, while Helen
                  remained at the castle with their daughter, but she refused to be left behind. She
                  would not permit him to go on so dangerous an errand unaccompanied by herself; if
                  he perished, she would die with him.
               Neither of the parents could bear to leave behind them the sole treasure of their
                  hearts—the young Ida; she had never been separated from them a day in her life,
                  and since the mysterious disappearance of their son, they feared to lose sight of
                  her even for an hour. Where they could venture she must be taken, and accordingly
                  Ida accompanied them to Paris.
               With some difficulty they reached the city in safety, and obtained a retired
                  lodging. De Vere was compelled to make his inquiries in the most cautious manner,
                  to avoid being compromised by the human tigers in power. He believed that his
                  nationality would prove a sufficient protection, but in the excited state of the
                  popular mind this was a slender reed to rely on. Paris had so long been turned
                  into human shambles, that the ferocious rabble looked with eagerness for the daily
                  supply of victims, and grumbled at those in power if they were not forthcoming,
                  caring little whence they came, or of what they had been guilty, provided they
                  were immolated on the blood-stained shrine erected in the name of liberty and
                  equality.
               De Vere had now been six months in Paris without having gained a clue to the
                  whereabouts of Mrs. Fitzhugh. He had been able only to ascertain that she had been
                  imprisoned in La Force; but after a few days' detention there, was removed to some
                  other prison—which one he found it impossible to learn. By using money freely, he
                  obtained lists of those who had suffered the extreme penalty of decapitation
                  within the last three months; her name
                  was not found among them, and this was the only ground of hope that Mrs. Fitzhugh
                  had escaped thus far.
               Suddenly there was a commotion in the streets beneath the windows, and the cry of
                     à la lanterne! à la lanterne! was heard,
                  presently drowned by the muffled tramp of the gathering multitude, and the wild
                  notes of the Marseillaise, in which is so strangely mingled the song of glory and
                  the monotone of death. Few could hear it thus chanted, by an excited and maddened
                  multitude, without shivering and growing pale. It seemed indeed "a hymn of
                  patriotism, but also an imprecation of rage."
               Helen precipitately arose, and said:
               "It is too horrible! I can no longer bear this. They are dragging some poor wretch
                  to his doom, and such incidents are of daily occurrence. Let us go, Reginald; I
                  have given up all hope of learning the fate of my mother, and I believe I shall
                  lose my reason if I remain much longer amid such sights and sounds of horror."
               De Vere regarded her with tender compassion.
               "Alas! Helen, I feared that your courage would give way; but it is no longer
                  possible for us to escape from the city. Every barrier is guarded, and an attempt
                  to leave, would bring suspicion upon us—perhaps arrest."
               She became even paler than before, and clasping her thin hands, exclaimed:
               "And arrest is death! I am tortured every hour by the dreadful scenes
                  enacting in this terrible Inferno, a city given over to the passions of the lowest
                  and vilest of the mob. They destroy everything; they respect nothing. Oh, God!
                  they have repudiated Thee, and with Thee all that is grand or noble in
                  humanity."
               "Yes," said De Vere, gloomily, "the step from infidelity to license is very short,
                  and these people have taken it at one bound. The man who does not recognize the
                  divinity ity within himself, is not likely to respect that which God has given
                  alike to all; in some, to be stifled and outraged forever; in others, looming up
                  as a lambent flame to light the world upon its path. Of the last are the martyrs,
                  and many have they been in this mad outburst of sedition and crime."
               Helen did not reply, for she was occupied with her daughter, who had crept to her
                  side and buried her head in her bosom to shut out the lugubrious sounds that
                  penetrated into the room.
               "Oh, mamma," she whispered, "they are killing some poor man, and we cannot help
                  him. Should not papa speak to them, and tell them how wicked it is to take the
                  life that God has given?"
               "It would do no good, my child. Your father would only expose himself to the
                  danger of sharing the poor creature's fate."
               The child shuddered, rushed to her father's side, and clasped her slender arms
                  around him as if to shield him from the approach of danger. He tenderly caressed
                  her, while he spoke to his wife in a low and guarded tone.
               "In a few more days, I hope that a chance of escape will open to us. A reaction is
                  taking place among the people; Robespierre, lately their idol, has been attacked
                  in the Convention, and a powerful party is organized against him. The people of
                  the better classes are weary of this mob rule, and they will rally against the
                     sans culottes of the sections when the time
                  for action arrives. I have secured a friend, who warns me of the progress of
                  events; and, when the tyrant falls, he will aid us to escape from this living
                  pandemonium."
               Helen listened with parted lips and dilating eyes. She faintly said:
               "If the fall of the tyrant is our only chance to escape, we may as well give up all hope at once, for he is
                  too powerful to succumb. He will crush all opposition, and prove himself more
                  sanguinary than ever."
               "Hope for the best, my love, for hope alone can now sustain us. I must go forth on
                  my daily quest, and make another effort to trace your mother. It would be cowardly
                  to abandon the search, as long as a hope of success remains."
               "I have lost all hope," was the despondent reply.
               "Nay, never say that, Helen; for in the darkest hour, light oftens breaks."
               At that moment, three knocks were heard below. Heavy steps slowly ascended the
                  staircase, and the same summons was repeated on the door of the room. De Vere went
                  calmly forward and opened it, though his heart beat painfully. A man in a blouse,
                  with the cap of Liberty upon his head, brusquely said:
               "Are you the citizen De Vere?"
               Sir Reginald bowed affirmatively, and he offered him a soiled and crumpled letter
                  as he said:
               "This is for you; but good citizens do not retain the aristocratic De before their names. I advise you to drop it,
                  citizen."
               "Your advice is good, my friend, and I accept it; but I am not accountable for the
                  act of my correspondent. I am citizen Vere, nothing more."
               "It is well—good day, citizen."
               De Vere offered him a piece of money; but, with a gesture of contempt, the man
                  refused it, and descended the stairs muttering something about the cursed
                  aristocrat.
               "What can it be?" asked Helen, in a flutter of excitement at this unusual
                  occurrence. "Perhaps it is from my mother at last."
               De Vere hurriedly broke the seal, and read a few lines traced in a cramped hand on
                  a fragment of paper.
               
                  "The person you seek is in St. Lazare. She is under condemnation of death, but
                     her name is last on the list, and three days must elapse before it can be
                     called. Three days are enough for a man of energy and determination to save a
                     helpless woman."
               
               Helen eagerly read the lines while standing beside him, and she exclaimed:
               "At last we have a clue! Now what shall we do—what can we do, to rescue her?"
               "I must consult with the friend of whom I spoke. He is a follower of Collot
                  D'Herbois, and can materially serve me. My first effort must be to communicate
                  with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and let her know that help is at hand."
               "Poor mother, how wretched she must be! How much she must have suffered during
                  this long imprisonment! If we can only rescue her, and take her back with us, it
                  will seem almost like old times. Once more we will gather in our own home, and
                  give up the search which has yielded us only disappointment. Our boy is lost to
                  us; let us centre our affections in our daughter, and try and be happy."
               De Vere kissed her brow tenderly, and said:
               "Yes—it will be best so. We have done all that human effort can accomplish,
                  without gaining any result. The child is removed forever from us—he is probably
                  dead."
               "Ah! if I only knew that he is in his quiet grave, I should be happy," said the
                  pale mother, with a convulsive sigh. "It is the uncertainty about his fate that is
                  slowly killing me. He may be starving, beaten, crushed by unkindness, and we, who
                  pine so deeply for his presence, cannot succor him—cannot save him."
               She wept bitterly, and De Vere lingered a few moments to strengthen and console
                  her.
               "After nearly seven years of unavailing search, Helen, it is scarcely possible that our son yet lives. Let us
                  cherish the belief that God has taken him to himself, or he would have caused him
                  to be restored to us ere this time. I must leave you now, my love; compose
                  yourself, and reassure this little trembler, who clings to your robe as if alarmed
                  by every sound."
               "Be careful, I conjure you, Reginald. Remember how helpless we are, and do not
                  expose yourself to any danger that can be avoided."
               "Oh, I readily promise you that. I shall use every caution consistent with the
                  success of my enterprise."
               He bade them a tender adieu, and hurried to the Hotel De Ville, where he expected
                  to find the friend of whom he had spoken.
               A wild scene of tumult was passing in the Convention, which met at the Hotel de
                  Ville. Tallien, Barrère and their friends were preparing for their final attack
                  upon Robespierre, in which they charged him with the intention of making himself
                  Dictator. De Vere mingled among the crowd that filled the ante-chamber, and after
                  waiting a weary hour he saw the person for whose appearance he had bern watching
                  come from the interior hall. He raised his hand to attract his attention, made a
                  sign which was rapidly returned, and the two issued from the door at the same
                  moment and moved toward a retired street without apparently having any interest in
                  each other.
               When they were free from observation, the Frenchman crossed to the side on which
                  De Vere slowly sauntered, and asked in an indifferent tone:
               "In what can I serve you, citizen?"
               "Read this, and see."
               He did not venture to give him the note he had received lest some one might be
                  watching them. He dropped it on the pavement, and passed leisurely on. The man
                  secured it, glanced rapidly over its contents, and quickly rejoined him.
               "I was about to communicate this news to you myself, but some one has forestalled
                  me. Citizeness Fitzhugh is in St. Lazare, and I have obtained a permit for you to
                  visit her."
               "Ha! how long have you known this?"
               "Only three hours; but in that time I have earned the hundred pounds you promised
                  me. I had some trouble to get the order from Collot, for he has much on his hands
                  just now, but I succeeded at last."
               "Thanks, my friend, and now let us use it as speedily as possible. Assist me to
                  get safely away from this city with my family and this unhappy lady, and I will
                  make the hundred pounds a thousand."
               "Ah, citizen, I will use my best efforts to serve so liberal a person as you are.
                  The executions still go on; innocent blood flows like water, but a better day is
                  coming. If we can save citizeness Fitzhugh but forty-eight hours, a change will
                  have taken place, and we shall be saved, or be crushed in one general ruin."
               "Forty-eight hours? Will the crisis come so soon?"
               "I have said it; the battle has already commenced: it rages now in words;
                  to-morrow it must end in blood."
               "And what will be the issue?"
               "Who can tell? The leaders on either side battle for their heads, for to fail is
                  death by the knife. We may lose all: if so, both you and I are lost, for suspicion
                  has already been directed against you, and you have been denounced as a foreign
                  spy."
               De Vere paused a moment; his strong heart grew cold within him as he abruptly
                  asked:
               "Whence comes this accusation? You know it to be false."
               
               "Yes—and so does a greater than I, which is more to the purpose; but that will not
                  avail you if Robespierre remains in power. Who made the denunciation I know not. I
                  saw your name on the list of the suspected, and, citizen, to be suspected in this
                  wretched country, is to die."
               "Ah, you speak the truth; I must remove from my present lodgings and seek a better
                  place of concealment,"
               "It will be useless, for you are under strict surveillance and every movement you
                  make is watched. Doubtless our steps are followed at this moment."
               "Then how can you with safety give me the order you say you have in your
                  possession?"
               "I hold it in the hollow of my hand; when we part we will shake hands, and you can
                  secure it. Call a fiacre at the first stand, and try to elude your pursuer."
               "Thanks, Morlaix; I will never forget your efforts to serve me."
               "Ah, citizen, Madame Fitzhugh has been a good friend to me and mine in other days,
                  and I do not forget such obligations. She has been guilty of no crime, although
                  her name is on the condemned list. Adieu, sir, I must return to the Convention,
                  for a terrible strife rages there, in which both your life and my own is bound
                  up."
               Morlaix offered his hand, and the transfer was dextrously made; he then hurried
                  away, occasionally looking back to see if he was followed. He saw nothing
                  suspicious, and passed out of the narrow street into a broader thoroughfare
                  swarming with rough-looking men, mingled with soldiers armed to the teeth.
               De Vere, watchful and cautious, slipped the paper he had received into his coat
                  sleeve, and sauntered slowly forward as if he had no particular object in view,
                  till he came to a carriage stand. Selecting one with a fresh-looking horse, he
                  showed a piece of money to the driver, and said:
               "Take me to St. Lazare as rapidly as possible, and I will pay you double
                  fare."
               The driver whipped up his horse and set off in a quick trot; they soon left the
                  locality from which they had started far behind them, but he had not evaded the
                  bloodhound, who had been set upon his track. The same man who had been the bearer
                  of the note to De Vere, thrust his head from behind a pillar that sheltered him,
                  and with a cruel laugh, said:
               "Safely hooked! Now I'll see after the lady. Lady, forsooth! we
                  exterminate such useless lumber here, and let only women live: women
                  who can fight for freedom, and drink the blood of the aristocrats. Ha! I only wish
                  they all had one throat, and I could thrust my knife in that."
               With this ferocious thought he turned toward the lodgings of De Vere to carry to
                  Helen the order for her arrest and separation from her child, for such was the
                  infamy he was commissioned to perpetrate.
               In the meantime, De Vere was whirled away toward the prison into which he was so
                  anxious to penetrate. The cab stopped beneath its gloomy walls; in front of the
                  door stood the death-carts receiving their daily role of victims; among them were
                  men, women, boys of tender years, and the anxious eyes of the visitor scanned each
                  load with the fear that he might find among them the person he came to seek. He
                  drew a deep breath as he became assured that Mrs. Fitzhugh was not in that fated
                  crowd, and with a sickened and oppressed heart passed beneath the portals of the
                  prison.
               The keeper examined the order he presented, then gave the bearer a broad stare,
                  and called an assistant, to whom he whispered a few words; he then said:
               "Conduct the citizen to the cell of citizeness Fitzhugh. He has a permit to see
                  her."
               
               The man signed to De Vere to follow him, and after leading him through several
                  gloomy corridors, he opened the door of a small damp chamber furnished with a
                  straw mattress and a deal table, on which was placed a pitcher of water and a
                  plate containing some fragments of bread.
               A gaunt and wasted form arose from the mattress as De Vere entered, and with a cry
                  of surprise exclaimed:
               "Oh, Reginald, I thought myself deserted by all; but you are here; you have come
                  to save me."
               "I trust so, dear madam. I have been long trying to discover your place of
                  confinement; but until to-day I had little hope of succeeding."
               "How long have you been in Paris?"
               "Six weeks."
               "And Helen?—Ida? Where have you left them?"
               "They are with me."
               "With you! Good Heavens! you surely have not ventured to bring them into this den
                  of vampyres? I would sooner have perished alone than to have exposed those I love
                  to such danger."
               "Have good courage, madam, for I trust we shall all escape. I have friends, and
                  times are changing in this miserable country. The reign of blood must soon end,
                  and we shall be permitted to return to England in safety."
               "And the boy? No news yet of him?"
               A deep gloom overspread the face of De Vere, as he said:
               "I have given him up, for I have sought everywhere without success. And now tell
                  me how you came to linger in Paris till you were arrested. Why did you not fly to
                  England at the first alarm?"
               "I should have done so; but my cousin, to whom I was tenderly attached, was ill of
                  an incurable disease. She required constant care, and the ruin of her family
                  deprived her of the means to procure a nurse. I had shared her prosperity, and in
                  adversity I could not desert her. I remained with her till her death; then it was
                  too late to escape; for she lingered on through all the horrors of the times till
                  the execution of her eldest son gave her her final death-blow. In a few hours
                  after her decease the whole family was arrested: her youngest son and a daughter
                  have already perished, and I know not why I did not share their fate."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh uttered these details with the air of a person who had suffered so
                  much as to become stupefied, and De Vere gazed with the deepest compassion upon
                  her whitened hair and pallid face. He made an effort to speak cheerfully:
               "Have patience, dear madam, yet a little while, and I trust you will be free once
                  more."
               "But to-morrow the death-carts will demand their victims; my name may be called
                  and then it will be too late," she replied, in a hollow tone.
               "I have reason to believe that you will be passed over. Keep up your courage, for
                  I trust that I can yet save you."
               "You have risked so much to do so, that you deserve success," said Mrs. Fitzhugh
                  with a melancholy smile.
               "The poor remnant of my life is not worth much; but I shrink from the thought of
                  dying by violence."
               The next half hour was passed in giving personal details that were of interest to
                  those who had been so long separated, and with some surprise De Vere heard the
                  grating of the key in the lock. He looked at his watch and said:
               "I was granted an hour, but they seem to have abridged the time. I had much to
                  say—many arrangements to make; but now I can only assure you that everything that
                  lies in my power shall be done to ensure your escape."
               He arose, turned toward the door, which slowly opened and revealed a spectacle
                  which seemed to turn him into stone.
                  Helen, insensible, with her long hair streaming over her person, was borne into
                  the cell in the arms of a turnkey, who placed her upon the mattress before De Vere
                  recovered voice enough to ask:
               "What does this mean? and where is my daughter?"
               "It means that you and this woman are on your way to Paradise by the road paved
                  with saw-dust," brutally replied the same man who had delivered the note to him a
                  few hours before. "As to the little one, she is but a baby, and she was
                  spared."
               "But what have you done with her? Bring my child hither, that she, at least, may
                  receive our last blessings, if, as you assert, we have been ensnared to our own
                  destruction."
               "Well, my Prince, have you any more orders to give?" asked the man mockingly, "for
                  you speak as if the world belongs to you. Your little girl is in very good hands,
                  and will be well taken care of; that is enough to tell you, so I will leave you to
                  console madame. Citizeness Fitzhugh, here is an order for your release, and you
                  will come with me."
               Mrs. Fitzhugh was bending over Helen trying to restore her to consciousness, and
                  she scarcely heeded his words. When he repeated them in a peremptory tone, she
                  hurriedly said:
               "Let me stay here; I do not ask to go and leave those who have lost themselves to
                  save me."
               "But you have no choice; come at once, or it will be worse for you and those you
                  leave behind you."
               De Vere aroused himself from the paralysis that seemed to have fallen upon him,
                  and taking her hand said:
               "Go with him, dear madam. Find my daughter, and keep her with you till she can be
                  restored to her native land. If we perish, on you must devolve the task of
                  protecting Ida."
               "And leave my poor Helen thus?"
               "There is no alternative, madam. Heavy as this blow is, we must seek consolation
                  where alone it may be found."
               The man again warned her that it was time to leave, and kissing the cold cheeks
                  and lips of Helen, she wrung the hand of De Vere and was hurried away.
               Helen recovered from one nervous spasm only to fall into another, and the only
                  words that escaped her lips were faint cries for her daughter. At twilight a man
                  came in carrying a stone jug filled with water, from which he replenished the
                  pitcher, and then placed a small loaf of bread upon the plate.
               Again the harsh lock grated, and the unhappy prisoners were left alone; alone in
                  their desolation and bereavement. De Vere endeavored to comprehend how he had
                  fallen into this snare; but he found it impossible to understand why he should
                  have been substituted for the person he had come to save.
               There was now but one hope left him—that the government might fall in time to save
                  himself and his wife from the fate that menaced them; but what in the meantime
                  would become of their daughter? that timid and sensitive child, left in the midst
                  of such terrors as would assail her in a strange place, separated from all she
                  loved.
               That terrible night was passed in darkness; he sat with the trembling form of his
                  wife pressed to his breast, endeavoring to sustain her courage by whispering hopes
                  he did not himself feel. At intervals he moistened her parched lips with water,
                  but neither of them touched the bread. Food would have choked them in those hours
                  of bitter anguish, and the sad wail of each heart was not for the death that hung
                  suspended over them, but for the fate of that beloved and lost daughter whom they
                  might never more behold.
               
               Confused murmurs from without reached their ears, and they knew that all Paris was
                  astir on that night, on the events of which hung so many lives; the dull echo of
                  thousands of trampling feet—the wild cries of horror, or of exultation, came
                  faintly through their prison walls; but they could draw no augury from them of
                  what was happening, nor console themselves with the hope of ultimate escape from
                  the snare into which they had evidently fallen.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               ALINA'S REVENGEFUL PLANS RIPENING.
               A CHATEAU a few leagues from Paris was occupied by a foreigner and his wife, who
                  had some mysterious connection with those in power, for they passed to and from
                  the city without question; a paper with a few lines upon it, traced by the hand of
                  Robespierre himself, being their passport at the barriers, and Citizen Maretsky
                  found no difficulty in entering or leaving Paris at all hours.
               Alina, still beautiful, though an expression of chagrin and lassitude veiled her
                  features, sat in a poorly furnished room awaiting the return of her husband. Her
                  own toilette also betrayed the change in her circumstances which her surroundings
                  indicated, for her dress was of cheap material and carelessly worn.
               On her arrival in Russia, Alina's visions of a grand future had met with a signal
                  downfall, and she found that she had been made the victim of a daring deception on
                  the part of Maretsky. He was not the Baron, but the younger brother of that
                  dignitary, and his anxiety to gain possession of the diamond necklace was partly
                  to gratify a penchant of his eccentric brother for collecting the finest diamonds
                  in the world; partly to gain the large sum which Alina secured by her complicity
                  in that affair.
               The money and jewels which had been given in exchange for his costly prize were
                  advanced by the Baron, who had so great a desire to snatch these jewels from the
                  Queen of France that he was willing to give even their full value to gain
                  possession of them. As the reward of his brother's dexterity, he bestowed on him a
                  valuable estate, at the same time expressing the hope that it would not be
                  dissipated at the gaming table, as his other patrimony had been. The caution
                  proved unavailing, for in five years from the consummation of the fraud, Maretsky
                  was not only ruined himself, but he had mortgaged his wife's annuity and disposed
                  of nearly all her available property.
               The Baron refused him any further assistance, and he returned to France with
                  Alina, in the hope that she could realize something from the fragment left from
                  her uncle's estate. La Rosière had passed into other hands, and Maretsky hired the
                  chateau in which they now lived. He became a violent Republican, and found
                  employment under the government as a spy.
               Madame L'Estrange, in deep disgust at the deception practised by the soi disant Baron, secured her own portion of the
                  spoil, and retired to Vienna, where she lived in such state as drew around her a
                  circle of friends and admirers. To her care Alina committed her son, who was
                  placed at college in the city, and the faithful Betty left the service of her
                  mistress to be near the darling of her heart.
               The bitter disappointment and resentment of Alina at the deception practised
                  against her, no words may depict; but Maretsky soon made her feel that she was in
                  his power, and he threatened her with the heaviest penalties if she attempted to
                  repudiate her allegiance to him. He loved her for her beauty and grace, and he valued the subtle tact of which she was
                  mistress too much to be willing to give her up.
               At times Alina bore the chain willingly, at others it goaded her almost to
                  desperation; but this man had an iron hand, with which he did not hesitate to
                  crush the first symptoms of rebellion, and in time she became his obedient
                  slave.
               Two days before the arrest of De Vere, she sat and watched impatiently for the
                  return of Maretsky from Paris, for she was anxiously expecting news from her son,
                  from whom she had not heard for many weeks. She at length heard the clatter of his
                  horse's hoofs, and hastened to join him in the supper-room. Maretsky seemed
                  elated, but he did not communicate his news till the repast was over and the
                  servant had retired.
               "There are no letters," said Alina, or you would have given them to me."
               "No—but there is something better. Something that promises money—money, which we
                  need above all things."
               "What is it, then? for I am as much in need of money as you can be."
               "Ah, well, I have a capital chance to make a good haul now."
               "Explain, if you please; I do not understand enigmas." He abruptly asked:
               "Do you know anything of your aunt, Mrs. Fitzhugh?"
               Alina shrugged her shoulders indifferently:
               "I neither know nor care. She was only my uncle's wife, and we have long ceased to
                  have any intercourse with each other."
               "You will not be shocked, then, when I tell you that she has been arrested; that
                  she has been in prison for the last two months?"
               "What can she have done? and why did she not leave France before this danger
                  reached her?"
               "She has done nothing herself, but she was involved in the ruin of a family that
                  was implicated in the faction of Camille Desmoulins. They have all perished by the
                  guillotine, but Mrs. Fitzhugh is still in prison, and there is really nothing
                  against her, I believe."
               "Then you may be able to save her, perhaps. But how are we to gain anything by
                  that? She has very little with which to repay the service."
               "That is true; but that rich Englishman, who married your cousin, has actually
                  come to Paris to find and, if possible, to rescue her from the fate that threatens
                  her."
               "Sir Reginald De Vere in Paris! and where, then, is Helen?"
               "With him, of course; as is also their child. I learned this to-day from a
                  creature of my own, and now, if we play our cards well, we can make him pay
                  roundly for his imprudence."
               Alina's eyes sparkled, and a cruel smile gleamed on her red lips, revealing the
                  points of her even and white teeth. She rapidly said:
               "They have thrown themselves into the toils, and now let them escape if they can.
                  This is, indeed, glorious news, for it shall give the De Vere estate to my
                  son."
               "How can that be managed, pray? I do not understand."
               "Yet nothing is more simple. You have access to Robespierre; ask for the release
                  of my aunt, and as its price promise to place at his mercy an Englishman and his
                  wife who came hither as spies. Once in prison, and their doom is certain: the girl
                  I will take charge of; she is the heiress: I will send her to Madame L'Estrange to
                  be educated; she will have opportunities of seeing my son, and they shall learn to love each other. When they are
                  old enough they shall be married, and thus the succession to his father's estate
                  will be secured to Lionel."
               She spoke rapidly and decisively, and Maretsky listened with admiration.
               "Ah, you are a treasure, I declare—a perfect treasure. Yes—you have developed a
                  masterly policy; I will adopt it; I will save the life of your aunt by the
                  sacrifice of these people. But we must lose no time, for clouds are gathering
                  about Robespierre; the people are becoming weary of his ideal republic, which, it
                  seems, is to be cemented and sustained by blood alone."
               "Ah, if he should fall, what are we to do?"
               "Do? Why, in the first place we will wring a few thousand pounds out of this
                  Englishman for keeping off his trial a few days. Then, when he is finally dealt
                  with, you can go over to England, claim the guardianship of the daughter as
                  nearest of kin, and have a snug home at De Vere Castle, with a handsome allowance
                  for taking charge of the heiress. Madame L'Estrange and Lionel can join you there,
                  and your plans be more securely carried out than in Vienna. To you,
                  with your abilities, all this will be easy of accomplishment."
               Alina smiled, and held out her hand:
               "Agreed. Rid me of Sir Reginald and my detested cousin, and I see my way clear
                  before me. We do not condemn them to death, but the country whose
                  laws they have violated. I cannot see my aunt perish without making an effort to
                  save her, and that cannot be done without the immolation of these victims.
                  Denounce them, and obtain her release as your reward."
               "It is my purpose to do so to-morrow. De Vere has a friend who is attached to
                  Collot D'Herbois. This Morlaix was once a porter in the establishment of Mrs.
                  Fitzhugh's relatives, and it is chiefly through his efforts that she has not
                  before been tried and condemned. When she was removed from La Force, he lost sight
                  of her, and he has been using every effort to discover which prison she was
                  removed to, urged on by a large bribe offered him by De Vere in case of
                  success."
               "How have you learned all this?"
               "Oh, I have my agents, as Robespierre has his. I am in the secrets of the police,
                  for I hold a confidential position among the accredited spies of the government. I
                  have gained much useful information for those in power from abroad, as well as in
                  France, and my full value is appreciated."
               Thus was this nefarious plan arranged. Maretsky and his astute companion spent the
                  greater portion of the night in arranging all its details, and providing against
                  every contingency. Ida was to be brought at once to the chateau, and detained
                  there till a safe opportunity offered to send her to Vienna, or to cross over to
                  England, as they might deem most prudent,
               Maretsky really possessed the power of which he had boasted, for he succeeded in
                  obtaining the order for the release of Mrs. Fitzhugh, and the arrest of De Vere
                  and his wife. He obtained information of the order for Sir Reginald's admission to
                  the prison of St. Lazare, and caused a private notice to be sent to the keeper,
                  commanding him to retain the bearer of it as a prisoner.
               Maretsky then went in person to superintend the proceedings at De Vere's lodgings.
                  Helen, almost in a paroxysm of frenzy, was torn from her daughter, and borne away
                  in a state of insensibility, while the child was placed in a close carriage, which
                  set out at once for the chateau.
               A note was left for Mrs. Fitzhugh, which simply apprised her that a friend had
                  obtained her freedom, and warned her
                  that she had best remain in strict retirement until an opportunity to escape from
                  the country, which should be provided, offered itself. The writer assured her that
                  he should keep himself informed of her whereabouts, and communicate with her at
                  the proper time.
               The agent of Maretsky conveyed Mrs. Fitzhugh to a lodging in an obscure street,
                  and left her there, too bewildered and ill to take any measures to assist those
                  who had taken her place in the cell at St. Lazare.
               Ida's cries and supplications were disregarded. Maretsky tried entreaties, then
                  threats to silence them after they set out on their journey; finding these
                  unavailing, he had recourse to other means. He forced her to drink wine in which
                  he had mixed a powerful narcotic, and this soon stupefied her to such a degree
                  that she was taken from the carriage in a helpless condition, and on being removed
                  to bed, she soon fell into a deep sleep, which lasted many hours.
               The grounds around the chateau were very extensive, and near a gate which opened
                  toward a small village in its vicinity, was a pavilion containing two rooms, which
                  had once served as a gardener's house. This was occupied by a solitary woman, who
                  had lived in it a year before the chateau was taken by Maretsky. The recluse
                  always wore a black serge robe, and a large bonnet, which concealed her features.
                  She communicated with no one, and was known only as the benefactress of the poor
                  people around. It was believed that she was under a vow of silence, for she seldom
                  spoke unless compelled to do so, and Sister Therése, as the country people called
                  her, was supposed to be one of the nuns whom the events of the Revolution had
                  deprived of an asylum.
               On the second morning after Ida's abduction, she was sitting under the shadow of a
                  tree reading, when she was surprised to hear voices speaking in English on the
                  other side of a thick hedge, which concealed her from observation. A child was
                  sobbing and entreating to be restored to her parents, to which her companion
                  replied:
               "Be good and obedient, Ida, and my husband will endeavor to rescue your father and
                  mother. They have been imprudent, and are in prison, but they may soon be
                  liberated, and then I will take you to them."
               "Oh, let me go to them now. I can stay in prison too; I cannot—I cannot live away
                  from them."
               "But it is my will that you shall remain here. I am your cousin; the cousin of
                  your mother, and it would be criminal in me to thrust you also into danger."
               "Then they are in danger! oh, my heart will break."
               The child wept violently, and the lady drew her away; the involuntary listener
                  could hear no more, but her sympathies were deeply enlisted, and she resolved to
                  find out the cause of the child's distress; to alleviate it as far as lay in her
                  power, for she lived only to do good to others.
               Late in the evening, the little girl, pallid and forlorn, wandered in the garden
                  alone. She spoke French very imperfectly, and Alina had no suspicion that the
                  sombre recluse of the pavilion had any knowledge of English. She was weary of the
                  child's wretchedness, and glad to be released from her presence for a season; so
                  she lay down to take her siesta, and Ida went out to indulge her grief alone.
               As she threw herself upon the turf, wringing her hands and crying aloud in the
                  impotence of her childish sorrow, a soft voice spoke to her in her own beloved
                  tongue.
               "What is it, my child? Sit up and tell me what has happened to distress you
                  thus?"
               The little girl looked up, reassured by the kind face that bent over her, and
                  wiping away her tears, said:
               "They have torn me from my parents, who are in prison —and—and I know, in spite of what cousin Alina
                  says, that those cruel people will kill them."
               
                  Alina! the name struck upon the heart of Sister Therèse as a blow
                  from a poniard, and she hurriedly asked:
               "Who, then, is your father?"
               "Sir Reginald De Vere."
               "And your mother? Was she Helen Fitzhugh?"
               "Yes, ma'am; for my grandma is named Fitzhugh?"
               The questioner placed her hand upon her heart to still its tumultuous throbbing,
                  for she held the clue to the wickedness that had been perpetrated. By dint of
                  persevering inquiries, Dora Calvert had possessed herself of the history of
                  Rudolph from the time of his disappearance from Baltimore, till he left Havre. The
                  actual fate of Sir Lionel De Vere she could not learn, but she divined it; and she
                  comprehended the nature of Alina well enough to know that in seeking to gain
                  possession of this child, she had some ulterior purpose to serve. She had also
                  traced Alina's career step by step till her departure for Russia, and she was
                  aware that it was the most ardent desire of her heart to have her son succeed to
                  the inheritance of his father. She rapidly ran over all this in her mind, and then
                  asked:
               "Have you any brothers or sisters, my child?"
               "No, ma'am; my brother is gone. My parents have only me."
               "And you are the heiress; I comprehend all now, and I will baffle this wickedness,
                  or perish in the attempt. Listen to me, and follow my directions implicitly, and I
                  promise to restore you to your parents, if it is possible to do so."
               "Oh, madam, I will do anything—anything for that."
               Dora reflected a moment.
               "Let no one know that I have spoken with you. No one about here is aware that I
                  speak English, and your cousin, above all, must not suspect it. Return to the
                  chateau; seem a little reconciled to the separation from your parents, and
                  to-morrow evening meet me here. I will bring you news of those you love."
               "Dear lady, how shall I thank you?"
               "By being prudent and watchful. In that lies your only chance of rescue. I am
                  satisfied that your parents have fallen into a snare carefully prepared for them.
                  In what prison is your father confined?"
               "In St. Lazare."
               "That is enough. I will seek the city and find him. To-day the tyrant falls, and
                  blood will cease to flow. Wipe away your tears; be tranquil, for I shall return
                  with good news, I feel assured. Trust to me, and I will find means to deliver
                  you."
               Ida eagerly thanked her, and promised all she required; but Dora abruptly left
                  her, for she saw the flutter of a white robe in the distance, and she hastened to
                  gain her retreat before she was discovered.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               A GAME FOR LIFE OR DEATH.
               DORA had many friends among the proscribed clergy, and one of these she sought in
                  the present emergency. The Abbé Dumont lived in the neighboring village,
                  stealthily performing the duties of his profession; and to him she confided the
                  story she had just heard, together with her own conjectures as to the motives of
                  Maretsky and his wife for what they had done.
               
               The Abbé listened with deep interest, and readily promised such assistance as he
                  could render. He was in the habit of entering Paris as a market man, there to
                  gather the news of the day without suspicion. His housekeeper often accompanied
                  him, and her place in the cart was readily surrendered to Sister Therése. By the
                  first gleam of daylight they passed the barriers, and heard the rejoicings of the
                  people, who sat around bonfires and sang the Marseillaise.
               Robespierre, lately their idol, had fallen; on that very day he was to be tried
                  and condemned, and they were rejoicing over his doom. A new era had dawned on
                  France, and henceforth the guillotine was to cease its diabolical activity.
               If De Vere had only escaped the proscription of the last forty-eight hours, all
                  might be well. The abbé left his vegetables in the care of his companion, and
                  sought a friend from whom he hoped to be able to gain such information as would be
                  useful to him. That friend, by a lucky chance, was Morlaix, and no sooner had he
                  named Sir Reginald De Vere, then he said:
               "Ah, I had hard work to save him till the tiger was dealt with; but he is safe. He
                  and his wife are liberated from prison, but they are wild at the disappearance of
                  their daughter. She has been spirited away, and they can find no trace of
                  her."
               "Where can I find Sir Reginald De Vere?"
               "At his old lodgings—rue de ——, number fifteen."
               "Thank you; I will seek him, as I have some news for him that he will be glad to
                  hear."
               'What—about the child?"
               "I believe so."
               "Then go in Heaven's name, and console the heart of that distracted mother."
               "I will do so, and you will do well to get passports from Collot D'Herbois for
                  this gentleman, with his wife, child and servant. He will need them by to-morrow
                  morning, and he will doubtless pay you a heavy sum for the service."
               "You are a wise man, Father, and I always do what you bid me; but I must also
                  include Madame Fitzhugh in the party, for she must return with them to England. I
                  have discovered where she is hidden, and I am on my way to her now."
               "As you please; only get the passports, and provide the means of reaching Calais
                  without delay."
               They separated to their different destinations. The abbé readily found the
                  lodgings of De Vere, and brought to the wretched parents the first news they had
                  learned of their lost child. He faithfully related all Dora had told him, and
                  informed De Vere that as the reward of the service she purposed to render him, she
                  desired to be included in the party, as companion or maid, as she was anxious to
                  escape from France. She pledged herself to return to Paris on the following
                  morning, bringing the little girl with her.
               Sir Reginald wished to return with him, but to this the abbé would not consent, as
                  their plans were already arranged, and his presence might cause them to miscarry.
                  In a tumult of doubt and anxiety, he prepared to seek Morlaix, and make his
                  preparations for immediate departure when once his daughter was restored to him.
                  On this day passports were freely granted, for the Terror had ceased to reign, and
                  men once more breathed freely.
               Dora returned in safety to her pavilion; there seemed to be a commotion in the
                  chateau which alarmed her, but on inquiring of a servant if anything had happened,
                  she replied that Citizeness Maretsky was uneasy about her husband band, as he had gone to Paris on the previous day,
                  and had not yet returned. There had been an émeute, and she feared that some disaster had befallen him.
               Dora watched anxiously for the appearance of Ida. Late in the evening the little
                  girl came into the garden, approached the pavilion, and looked anxiously around.
                  The new friend called to her, and she hastened toward her, and tremulously
                  asked:
               "Oh, madam, have you heard anything of my dear father and mother?"
               "Your parents are safe, my child. They are released from prison, and I have
                  promised to restore you to them."
               Ida threw herself in her arms, unable to utter her grateful thanks. She at length
                  said:
               "When can I go to them? My cousin at last sleeps. She has been in a fearful state
                  all day, and I thought I should never get away from her. But she will not sleep
                  long, for she is too uneasy about her husband's strange absence. She is preparing
                  to leave this place to-morrow morning, and to take me with her. She told me so
                  today."
               "Then we have no time to lose, and you must come with me now."
               The child frankly placed her hand in that of her new friend:
               "Take me to my parents. I have no fear of you, but I do fear the lady yonder, who
                  says she is my cousin; but I never heard of her before."
               Dora led Ida quickly toward the pavilion, and wrapped her in a black mantle, the
                  hood of which served in place of a bonnet; then locking the door she opened a
                  private gate, which unclosed on the open country, and they commenced their flight
                  toward the village, in which the Abbé Dumont lived.
               The path led through a woodland, which they traversed in safety; but the way was
                  long, and the child of late unused to walking. She soon breathed heavily, and
                  complained of being fatigued. Her companion sustained her wavering steps, and
                  assured her that in an hour they would be beneath the shelter of a friendly roof,
                  where she could rest before setting out for Paris. The thought of soon seeing her
                  parents infused new life into the weary little creature, and again she went on
                  with swift steps.
               Twilight had fallen, and the stars came out in the clear, blue sky. Suddenly the
                  clatter of a horse's hoofs, coming from the direction of the chateau, was heard;
                  and in alarm, Dora looked around for some place of concealment for her little
                  companion. They were now in the open road, and no friendly thicket was near to
                  shelter her from observation.
               In the shadow of a high fence she discovered a cart, which had broken down and
                  been thrust on one side, till the owner could return and remove it. Behind this
                  she placed the slender form of Ida, and rapidly explained to her that she would
                  walk slowly forward till the person who was approaching them had passed by; then
                  she would return for her.
               The trembling yet docile child comprehended that this was her only chance to
                  escape observation, and she crouched down with her dark wrapping folded around
                  her, in as small a space as possible.
               Dora took out her rosary and moved leisurely down the road. The rider saw her dark
                  form, recognized the benevolent recluse, for she was known to every one in the
                  vicinity, and sharply pulled up his horse.
               "Ah, Citizeness Therèse 'tis you. Have you, by chance, seen a little girl
                  straggling beyond the garden of the chateau? Citizen Maretsky brought one there
                  two days ago, and she has disappeared. I am sent to find some trace of her."
               
               "I saw her in the garden just before I left," replied Dora. "If you have seen
                  nothing of her on the road you have just traversed, she must have taken another
                  direction; or perhaps she is still in the garden. It is large, and has many
                  hiding-places in it."
               "It has already been thoroughly searched. No—she has run off, and Citizeness
                  Maretsky is in a frightful passion about it. Since you have seen nothing of her,
                  she cannot be on this road, so I may as well take some other direction."
               As he turned his horse's head, his eye fell upon the broken cart, and, to Dora's
                  intense alarm, he rode toward it and made a brief pause; but the frightened child
                  sat perfectly motionless behind the wheel that sheltered her, and, after a moment
                  of breathless suspense, the man put spurs to his horse and galloped back the way
                  he had come.
               Dora waited till the last sound had died away, and then drew out the trembling
                  fugitive, who was nearly insensible from fright.
               "The danger is past, my love; we shall now be able to reach the village without
                  further pursuit."
               "Ah, I felt as if I must die if he dragged me out; but he is gone. Let us run,
                  madam, for he may come back again."
               "No—you would soon become exhausted; we will walk quietly forward, and keep our
                  strength for an emergency, if one should arise."
               No further alarm reached them, and, as the village clock was striking nine, they
                  reached the humble cottage of the Abbé Dumont, which stood in a vegetable garden
                  which he cultivated himself. His market cart, already loaded, was in front of the
                  door, and the stout mule that drew it was grazing in a small paddock at one end of
                  the house. The priest, a slender, worn-looking man, received them with great
                  kindness, and congratulated Dora on her successful evasion.
               "The danger is not yet over," she replied, "for the alarm at the chateau will
                  extend here. This child must rest before we can remove her; but where can we find
                  a place of safety for her?"
               "Ah, we are provided against surprises; I will put her where I have often been
                  concealed myself from the myrmidons of the Terror.
               Ida, overcome with fatigue, had placed her head upon the table, and was already
                  asleep. The Abbé approached the large fire place, touched a concealed spring, and
                  the back opened, revealing a narrow recess in which a man might sit reclining
                  against the wall. In reply to his summons, an old woman came in bringing in an
                  armful of bedclothes, and in a few moments a pallet was spread within the cavity,
                  and Ida was placed upon it. Dora aroused her, and explained that if she heard a
                  noise in the room she must remain perfectly quiet, or she would not only
                  compromise her own safety, but that of the friends who were aiding her to escape.
                  With a sweet, sad smile, she replied:
               "No one shall suffer through my cowardice. I will remember all you have said, and
                  remain as still as if dead."
               The housekeeper placed bread, and butter, and milk before them, and after
                  partaking of this frugal fare Ida lay down upon her hard couch, and saw the panel
                  close with some palpitation of the heart; but she had perfect trust in her new
                  friends, and she soon slept peacefully. Dora went to the cottage of one of the
                  neighbors who was ill, and remained with her several hours, ministering to her as
                  she was in the habit of doing to the sick poor in the vicinity.
               Just as she had laid aside her fears, and was preparing to return to the priest's
                  house, the noise of a party of horsemen entering the village was heard. They
                  stopped at every door, and inquired if a child ten years of age, wearing a white
                  robe, had been seen in the village, and offered a large reward for her recovery. No one had seen such a
                  fugitive, and after uttering a few oaths they went on and dismounted at the Abbé
                  Dumont's cottage.
               The lights had been extinguished, and they knocked loud and long for admittance
                  before it was gained. At length the priest appeared, and mildly asked:
               "What would you have, friends? Why do you alarm my house thus, at this late hour
                  of the night?"
               "Because it suits us to do so," was the insolent reply of one of the intruders.
                  "We were sent hither to find a child that has been stolen from the chateau. If you
                  know anything of her, you had better make a clean breast of it, or it will be the
                  worse for you."
               "Friend, the Terror has ceased to reign; God is no longer repudiated in the land,
                  and his ministers are again entitled to the respect they once claimed from all
                  men. I resume my clerical character, and demand from you the obedience due to the
                  Curé. Leave my domicile, and cease to insult me by your brutal accusations."
               "Ha! but he takes a high tone," sneered one. "But that is not answering our
                  question."
               "Nor shall I condescend to answer it. Search my house and see if you can find the
                  person you seek."
               The priest struck a light, and placed a lamp upon the table. The men looked upon
                  the bare walls, the uncovered floor, and the fire-place filled with pieces of half
                  charred wood, which looked as if they had been undisturbed for months.
               "There is nothing suspicious here—but there are other rooms."
               "Yes—one that is occupied by my housekeeper, and a small one that serves me as my
                  cell," replied the abbé, coldly.
               The men took the lamp and entered the old woman's chamber, who sat up in bed in a
                  state of violent indignation at this intrusion; but they did not heed her
                  exclamations; they looked through every part of the room, and satisfied themselves
                  that no one was concealed within it. They then went to the other end of the
                  building, and looked into the small closet which the priest had well called a
                  cell. It had nothing in it but a mattress, a small table, and a cross, with a
                  reading lamp placed near it. When they returned to the outer room, the abbé
                  asked:
               "Why have you searched my house, when you have entered no other one in the
                  village? and who is this child of whom you are in pursuit?"
               "We came hither, citizen, because if any craft is to be used, a priest is always
                  the person sought out to practise it. The child is a relation of our employer, and
                  it is important to regain possession of her. If you will aid us, five thousand
                  francs shall be your reward, if we recover her through your assistance."
               "The servant of God does not barter his services for the lucre of gain. I have
                  borne with your presence as long as is necessary to accomplish your errand, and
                  you can now relieve me of it as soon as you may see fit. Midnight approaches, and
                  I must go to my devotions."
               "Ta! ta! now you will have leave to pray in public, so you needn't do
                  so much in the dark. But we will go, for it seems that we must look for our game
                  in another quarter."
               After a brief delay the party rode off, and after listening a few moments, the
                  Abbé drew near the chimney, sprung back the plate, and asked in a low tone:
               "Little one, are you ill with fright?"
               "Oh, no, sir; I heard it all, but my courage did not fail me," replied the sweet
                  voice of the child. "Now they are gone, shall we not soon leave?"
               "Yes—before very long; sleep again, my child, and when the time comes, I will
                  arouse you for the journey."
               
               But Ida could not sleep. She sat up, and watched with feverish anxiety for the
                  signal to leave her hiding-place. Dora soon returned, heard all that had passed,
                  and spoke a few words of encouragement to the patient little captive. She then lay
                  down on the housekeeper's bed, to snatch a few moments' repose before setting
                  forth to the city.
               The cart of the abbé had a box under the seat, contrived by himself, for the safe
                  transportation of articles that had been contraband during the troubled days of
                  the revolution, and in this the little girl was to be placed. In the afternoon,
                  while pretending to put in his load, he had bored a number of air holes in the
                  sides of this box, and its depth was sufficient to afford room to a slender child
                  like Ida, though her limbs would be a little cramped by the confinement.
               At two o'clock their arrangements were all completed, and Dora drew the child from
                  her place of concealment, and placed her in the narrow space assigned her. A
                  folded coverlet was placed beneath her, and everything that could render her as
                  little uncomfortable as possible was done. Ida was very tremulous, but she quietly
                  submitted to lie down, and have the lid closed over her. A cloak was then thrown
                  over the seat, carefully turned up at the sides to permit the air to circulate
                  through her hiding-place. Dora presently whispered:
               "Can you breathe freely, Ida? Is there air enough?"
               "Oh, yes, quite enough. I can see the stars through the holes. Only let us get
                  away, and I shall do well enough."
               The baskets of vegetables were already placed in the cart, and in the rough blouse
                  and slouched hat of the peasant, the Abbé took his place beside Dora. With a
                  hearty God speed from the housekeeper, they went on their way. The full moon was
                  rising, and every object was as clearly visible as in day-light; as the cart
                  jogged on they frequently spoke to the child, and found that she was awake and
                  patient, in the hope of being soon restored to those she loved. The lid of the box
                  was lifted several times to permit a thorough draft of fresh air to ventilate her
                  hiding-place.
               The city loomed in the distance in the first grey tints of approaching day before
                  they encountered any obstruction. Suddenly a man started from the road-side and
                  cried out:
               "Halt there! who are you, and where are you going?"
               "Can't you see for yourself?" replied the Abbé, brusquely. "We are market people,
                  bound for the city."
               "Ho! ho! but maybe you carry something more precious than vegetables."
               "You're welcome to look and see for yourself. Here are onions, carrots and
                  cauliflowers. You will find nothing more valuable than these, I trow."
               The man raised the cloth that covered the baskets, dropped it again and said:
               "Sure enough—there's nothing suspicious there. Hark ye, citizen, have you seen
                  anything of a lost child as you came along? I would reward any one nobly who could
                  give me a clue to one I am in search of."
               "A lost child? Is it a girl, or a boy?"
               "A girl—a delicate little creature, in a white robe."
               "No, citizen, I have overtaken no such child as you describe. Pardon me, but day
                  is breaking, and I shall be late in getting to market."
               The man stepped aside, and the vehicle rolled on; Dora quelled the rapid beating
                  of her heart, and when it was safe to do so, spoke in a low voice to the poor
                  child. She immediately replied:
               "I heard all—oh, hurry on, or I shall die in this narrow place."
               By this time a turn in the road had hidden them from their interrogator. The Abbé
                  whipped up his mule, and trotted rapidly toward the city. They passed the
                     barriers at last, and entered a
                  badly lighted street. A fiacre was drawn up near the sidewalk, in which sat a
                  muffled figure. A sign from the priest caused him to spring from his seat, and in
                  another moment, Ida, half paralyzed by her long confinement, was lifted out, Dora
                  sprang into the vehicle and received the child in her arms.
               Morlaix, after exchanging a few words with the Abbé, drove off at a furious pace,
                  and in half an hour they reached the lodgings of De Vere. He was on the watch for
                  their arrival, and with a stifled cry of gratitude he grasped his recovered
                  treasure, and holding Dora by the hand, mounted rapidly to his rooms.
               Helen, wild with joy, clasped her child and covered her with kisses; she then
                  threw her arms around the stranger who had saved her, and uttered her thanks and
                  blessings with hysterical rapidity.
               "You have saved her—you have restored her to me, and henceforth you shall be to me
                  as a sister. I claim you as the friend of my life."
               "Thanks, Lady De Vere," she gently replied—"I need friends, and such as yourself
                  and your husband any one may be proud to claim."
               She spoke in English, and the purity of her accent caused De Vere to say:
               "You are then a countrywoman of ours?"
               "Almost—I am an American, though for the last six years I have been a wanderer in
                  Europe. Much of that time has been spent in France, and I am weary of the turmoil
                  here. I need repose, and I wish to accompany you to England."
               He smiled brightly as he replied:
               "On one condition you shall go with us."
               "And what is that?"
               "That you will make our house your home; our purse your own."
               "To the first, I answer yes—to the last, no, for I have resources of my own which
                  suffice for my simple wants. I feel the need of a home, and I accept yours as
                  frankly as it is offered."
               Ida threw herself in her arms, and kissed her, and Dora felt repaid for all she
                  had done. Mrs. Fitzhugh, who was with them, looked on this scene and wept, for her
                  sufferings had brought her almost to a state of second childhood.
               An early breakfast had been ordered, as the traveling carriage was to be at the
                  door at nine o'clock, as Morlaix had followed the advice of the Abbé and prepared
                  everything for their departure. The interim was filled up with explanations, and
                  Helen said:
               "Alina—always Alina; she has indeed fulfilled her threat. But for you, dear
                  friend, this last blow would have broken my heart. Tell me by what name I shall
                  call my benefactress?"
               "Those who love me, call me Sister Therése. I am not a nun, though my days are
                  devoted to deeds of mercy," replied Dora, with a pensive smile.
               "And this day you have performed one that entitles you to eternal happiness."
               Breakfast was dispatched; at the appointed hour the carriage came to the door, and
                  scarcely believing in their good fortune, the party of travelers found themselves
                  beyond the barriers of the city in which they had suffered so much.
               While uttering their congratulations to each other, a trace broke, the horses were
                  stopped, and the driver got down to remedy the disaster. While they were thus
                  detained, a child, meagre and wan with famine, with his clothes in tatters, and
                  his brown hair matted in elf locks around a broad, clear brow, came to the door,
                  and in faltering accents, said:
               
               "Give me a few sous for the sake of the good God, for I am starving."
               "Poor infant!" exclaimed Helen, with starting tears. "See, he seems ready to
                  perish of want; and, oh, Reginald, he seems just the age our boy would have been.
                  Where are your father and mother, little one?"
               "I never had any," was the reply. "I lived in a large house with other children,
                  but the soldiers drove us all away, and now I have no one to give me food."
               "Good Heavens! Is not this too dreadful! A baby left to his own resources! Dear
                  Reginald, our child has been given back to us, and we should do something to show
                  our gratitude. Let us take this little waif, and provide for him."
               "But it may lead to some difficulty about the passports," objected De Vere. "We
                  had better leave him at the first cottage, with a sum of money sufficient to
                  induce the people to receive him."
               The child looked from one speaker to the other. Helen caught the gleam of his
                  clear, blue eyes, and she suddenly said:
               "My heart tells me to claim this child in the place of the one I have lost. Let me
                  have my way in this, my dear husband; brave a little inconvenience to gratify me;
                  for, oh! in spite of his rags and squalor, he reminds me of what our boy might
                  have been at his age."
               To this appeal De Vere could not reply by a refusal. The lad was placed on the box
                  beside the coachman, and at their first stopping place, a bath, clean clothing,
                  and wholesome food, restored to the little fellow all his natural vivacity. Dora
                  superintended his toilet, and she discovered upon his shoulder a cypher, stamped
                  by pricking the flesh deeply and rubbing in gunpowder. The letters were S. F. E.,
                  followed by a date, which they supposed to be that of his birth, as it
                  corresponded with his apparent age.
               Sir Reginald surmounted the difficulty at the passport office by simply stating
                  the truth concerning the boy, and requesting permission to remove him to England,
                  where he pledged himself to provide for him. Homeless and destitute children were
                  then too numerous in France to cause any objection to be raised, and the little
                  waif was taken to the castle, where he soon acquired the language he heard spoken
                  around him.
               The lad stated his name to be Jacques, but Lady De Vere, who felt herself hourly
                  drawn more nearly toward him, insisted that he should be called Henry, that having
                  been her father's name, and the second one bestowed in baptism upon her lost
                  son.
               With restored health, the boy proved to be both handsome and intelligent, and the
                  passionate attachment he evinced for his protectress rendered him dearer to her
                  with every passing day. As time passed on, Sir Reginald also came to regard him
                  almost as a son, and as the child of his adoption, he resolved to educate and
                  provide for him in the future.
               Thus years lapsed away; the children grew in beauty, and showed the tenderest
                  attachment for each other. Nothing was heard from Alina, and Helen almost ceased
                  to fear her machinations against her happiness.
               In France great changes had taken place. That wonderful man, Napoleon, had brought
                  order out of the chaos of the revolution; he had assumed the government as first
                  Consul, and was making rapid strides toward imperial power.
               Sister Therèse had visited France several times in pursuit of a friend she had
                  lost, but as yet she had been unsuccessful in finding him. Her home was at Vere
                  Castle, where she was beloved and cherished as the dearest of friends.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               NAPOLEON AS A MATCH-MAKER.
               ON a bright day in autumn two ladies sat together in a saloon at Malmaison, and
                  conversed with that freedom which the etiquette of a court had not yet destroyed.
                  The windows looked out on an enchanting park, with a stream of water flashing in
                  the distance.
               A bridge which spanned the stream was covered in and arranged like a tent, and in
                  this retreat the conqueror of Europe labored almost without intermission in the
                  service of the nation he ruled.
               A small private garden was attached to it, in which Napoleon walked when he felt
                  the need of exercise, and there his great plans for the future were matured.
               The ladies to whom we have referred were both young and lovely. Madame Louis
                  Bonaparte was then in the first bloom of youth, and certainly a fresher or fairer
                  looking creature could scarcely have been found. Her figure was supple and
                  delicately rounded; her head, from which flowed a profusion of blonde curls, was
                  gracefully set upon her shoulders, and her arms, hands and feet were models of
                  beauty. She was extremely fair, with soft penetrating blue eyes, in which the soul
                  of kindness dwelt, and a clear rose tint fluctuated on her transparent complexion
                  as feeling or emotion were aroused.
               Added to these attractions, she possessed a grace and suavity of manner which
                  rendered her charming to all who approached her, for in Hortense Beauharnais was
                  united the nonchalance of the creole with the
                  cultivation and vivacity of the polished Frenchwoman.
               Her companion was entirely different in style. She was a lovely brunette, with
                  large soft black eyes, and hair of the same color, with an expression of pensive
                  thought upon her regular features which seemed scarcely natural to her sparkling
                  style of beauty. Her figure was tall and stately, and the hand in which she held a
                  rose might have served as a model to a sculptor.
               "My dear Aglaë," said Madame Louis, with vivacity, "I have set my heart on seeing
                  you well married. Why do you refuse the attentions of our young cavaliers and hold
                  yourself as distant as Diana herself?"
               A bright glow flashed into the cheek of the young girl, which died away as,
                  quickly as it had arisen, and in a low tone she replied:
               "I shall never marry. I came to this determination in my childhood, and I have
                  seen no one who could induce me to change it. The young generals who surround the
                  First Consul have no attractions for me. They are gallant men, but they do not
                  come up to my ideal."
               The clear eyes of Hortense were turned full upon the speaker, and she asked with a
                  smile:
               "What then is your ideal, ma chere?"
               Aglaë laughed.
               "Oh, a grand and noble man; with courage that never falters, yet with a tenderness
                  of heart that would lead him to help and soothe the humblest creature. His person
                  must correspond with his soul, for a gem in a rough casket would not suit my
                  fastidious taste."
               "Well, for an idealist you are not very unreasonable. I believe that I can find
                  one to realize your visionary man."
               "Indeed! who can it possibly be? But mine is not a visionary man. I have known the
                  original of my sketch; in my infancy he rescued me from a frightful peril, and to
                  him I gave my childish heart. He is dead, and unless I can find his equal, I shall
                  live and die as Aglaë St. Angeau."
               
               "Who then was this wonderful man?"
               "He was known to us as M. Michel, though my father suspected that was not his true
                  name. He entered the French army, and was in a fair way to achieve distinction,
                  when his life was cut short by an assassin. I was then but ten years old, but the
                  blow nearly destroyed me. Oh, yes, Madame, child as I was, I loved him far better
                  than I shall ever love another. Through all the vicissitudes and dangers that
                  beset us in the days of the Terror, throughout all our wanderings, I managed to
                  preserve a portrait of him which was painted by my mother, and from it I have had
                  a miniature taken which I always wear next my heart."
               "Sentimental child! Let me look at this souvenir; I wish to see if the hero to
                  whom I wish to give you at all resembles him."
               "To whom do you allude, Madame?"
               "Show me the picture, Mademoiselle, and then I will tell you."
               With some reluctance Aglaë drew from a gold case, and touching a spring, it opened
                  and revealed a head of singular power and nobility of outline. Hortense uttered an
                  exclamation, and rapidly said:
               "Why, Aglaë, you have only been quizzing me. Do you already know General Ney?"
               "Only through his fame. But why do you regard me so strangely? I have spoken the
                  simple truth to you."
               "And this picture, worn next your heart, is really not one of him? It is
                  incredible, for the likeness is perfect. He is older now, and has a greater air of
                  command, but at twenty this medallion might have been taken for him."
               Aglaë pressed her hand upon her heart, and eagerly asked:
               "Who then is General Ney? What are his antecedents?"
               "No one knows much of them, for like nearly all of our distinguished military men,
                  he has risen by the force of his own genius. It is said that his father lives in
                  Sarre Louis, and is a respectable mechanic there; but Ney has soared so far above
                  his family that he can hold little intercourse with them—they have ceased to be of
                  his world."
               "Yet the tie of blood is strong, Madame; it should never be broken. Your hero has
                  a flaw in his escutcheon, which his resemblance to my hero will not
                  induce me to overlook."
               "My dear Aglaë, no one accuses the General of unkindness to his family. On the
                  contrary, he is extremely liberal toward them; but if you should become Madame
                  Ney, I think you will be well contented that he shall give them money, in place of
                  removing them from their true sphere and attempting to drag them upward with
                  himself. They would only clog the wings of the eagle, and prevent him from soaring
                  to the height he is bound to gain. The first Consul already regards General Ney as
                  his right hand, and no distinction will be too great for him if he pursues his
                  career as he has commenced it."
               "Aglaë laughed merrily:
               "And you have really formed the design of bestowing my hand on this magnificent
                  cavalier? Dear Madame Louis, what claim have I to such preferment?"
               "You have youth, beauty and fortune; what more can even General Ney ask in the
                  wife he may choose?"
               "But he may not choose a wife at all. I have heard that he is nearly forty, and
                  still unmarried."
               "I should scarcely believe him to be over thirty, and besides he is eminently
                  handsome, with that air of distinction which stamps itself on men of a high order
                  of genius. The First Consul wishes his generals to marry, and with their wives
                  form a sort of court around himself. He has signified this desire to General Ney,
                  and—shall I tell you his reply?"
               
               Mademoiselle St. Angeau changed color, and looked uneasy. She quickly said:
               "Pray do so, if I am interested in it."
               "You are more deeply interested in it than any one else, for he said that among
                  the beauties of the Consulate but one had any charms for him. That one was
                  Mademoiselle St. Angeau; and if she could be induced to accept his devotion, he
                  might think of marrying."
               Aglaë listened in astonishment.
               "General Ney can never have seen me, I am sure. If we had ever met, I must have
                  remembered him from the resemblance you say he bears to this picture. It is very
                  strange that he should have selected one so utterly a stranger to him."
               "He has seen you at the theatre. He was present on the night the First Consul's
                  life was in such imminent danger; he remarked your bearing on that occasion, and
                  came to the conclusion that you would make a fitting wife for a hero. Now you know
                  all I can tell you. I undertook to prepare you for the overtures of the general,
                  at the request of the First Consul himself."
               Aglaë listened in great perturbation. She had no wish to marry, and she feared the
                  imperious will of Bonaparte, which already made itself felt on those that
                  surrounded him. She was the chosen friend of Madame Louis, and warmly attached to
                  her; Hortense still formed a part of her mother's household, and Aglaë knew that a
                  refusal from her to receive this new pretender to her favor would be punished by
                  banishment from Malmaison. After a painful pause, she said:
               "I will think of this, Madame; and after consulting with my parents, I will cause
                  my decision to be made known to the First Consul. Thank you for the kindness which
                  induced you to undertake this mission. Let the affair end as it will, I trust that
                  it will make no difference in our friendship."
               "None, my dear; for I feel that it will end as I wish," was the tranquil response.
                  "Only see your new lover, let him plead his own cause, and I answer for the
                  result."
               Tears sprang to Aglaë's eyes, and she said:
               "Ah, Madame, you do not comprehend how fanatically I have devoted myself to a
                  memory; how fondly I have cherished the image that first impressed my childish
                  fancy. I admit that you have awakened in me a desire to see this preux chevalier, who so strangely resembles my early
                  friend. I will not refuse to receive him, for the wish of the First Consul must be
                  regarded as a command by me, but I cannot promise to give him my hand."
               "No—not until he asks it," replied Hortense, gaily; "and, as I live, he is at this
                  moment crossing the park in company with Napoleon. They are coming in this
                  direction, and you will soon be able to judge yourself if General Hey resembles
                  your cherished picture."
               Aglaë became very pale as she asked:
               "Ah, Madame, was not this meeting arranged beforehand? Have you not drawn me into
                  a snare?"
               "By no means. Napoleon knows your father's livery, and while the carriage waits,
                  he knows that you must be with me. The general has come to see him on business,
                  which he interrupts to present him to you."
               "Then there is absolutely no escape?"
               "None—unless you make an ignominious flight before the conquering hero comes.
                  Recall your color and your smiles, dear Aglaë; there is nothing formidable in
                  being presented to a man who, at present, only asks to be received as a friend.
                  Leave the future to take care of itself, and be your own charming, fascinating
                  self again."
               A bright flush stole to the cheek of the young girl as she watched the approach of the two figures upon
                  the lawn. Napoleon, in his plain gray suit, and military hat, was already familiar
                  to her, and the stately looking man who walked beside him, in the rich uniform of
                  a French general, lost nothing by being brought in comparison with the greatest
                  man of his day. There was an air of deference toward his companion, which did not
                  derogate from the self-respect and independence of character which was read in
                  every line of his noble face, in every movement of his powerful frame.
               As he drew nearer, a sudden trembling seized Mademoiselle St. Angeau, and she
                  murmured:
               "It is incredible. I remember Michel as he walked to and fro upon our lawn, and
                  the very movements of this stranger are the same. Yet, it is impossible. Michel is
                  in his grave, and this man cannot be he, in spite of this marvellous
                  resemblance."
               By a violent effort she controlled herself, and stood calm and self-possessed when
                  the First Consul and General Ney were announced. The former advanced, and
                  presented his companion to the two ladies; then, pinching Aglaë's ear, he said, in
                  a low tone:
               "I have brought my greatest hero to lay his trophies at your feet, Mademoiselle.
                  See that you receive them as becomes his deserts. Ah, I know that you will
                  encourage no lovers, but this time, nay will bear the alteration of a letter, and
                  I shall congratulate you, as Madame Ney. No reply, if you please, Mademoiselle,
                  for I have decided that it shall be so, and I am not used to contradiction when I
                  have set my heart on a thing."
               "It seems to me, General, that you are assuming the imperial style," said the
                  young girl, with slight hauteur. "My parents are the persons to be consulted in
                  the disposal of their only child."
               Napoleon regarded her searchingly, and a slight frown contracted his brow; but he
                  laughed, and said:
               "All in good time, Mademoiselle. I show you the prize; set your cap in its most
                  becoming fashion, for I assure you he is worth winning."
               There was something so quizzical in his expression, that Aglaë could not resist a
                  smile, and at that moment her eye caught that of Ney, who had been talking with
                  Madame Louis with that air of chivalrous gallantry seldom found among the
                  distinguished military men that surrounded Napoleon.
               The look sent a strange thrill through her heart; she replied with evident effort
                  to the few words he addressed to her, and her fluctuating color, her faltering
                  voice, showed him that she was deeply moved.
               "Can it be possible that she remembers me yet?" he thought; and unconsciously his
                  voice took a tender inflection as he continued to speak to her.
               The two spectators remarked this agitation on the part of the usually calm and
                  self-possessed Aglaë with secret triumph; for the proposed union was a project of
                  Hortense's, into which the First Consul had eagerly entered. Mademoiselle St
                  Angeau was a favorite with him; Ney was one of his most trusted friends, and the
                  present interview had been adroitly planned between them.
               In a few moments Aglaë recovered her usual dignified self-possession, and
                  conversed with her new acquaintance with the ease of one accustomed to society.
                  Napoleon and Madame Louis joined in the conversation, and Ney was charmed by the
                  graceful sallies of the young girl. To the banter of the First Consul she returned
                  such replies as made him feel that the game was not entirely in his own hands, and
                  he enjoyed the racy independence which gave her courage to retort on him in his
                  own vain of pleasantry. Half an hour slipped away, and Napoleon suddenly said:
               
               "Come, General, we have played the part of idlers long enough in this hall of
                  Circe. Let us return to the business of life."
               With a significant glance at Aglaë, he whispered:
               "Do not break your heart, Mademoiselle, for you shall see my friend ere long in
                  your father's house."
               They made their adieux, and left the two ladies together. Unconscious that she was
                  observed by her companion, Aglaë watched the receding form of him who had so
                  deeply impressed her. Hortense laughingly said:
               "It has happened as I predicted, ma chére. You
                  are struck with this noble and handsome man, and you will at last consent to
                  embrace the destiny of your sex. You will become a happy and honored wife."
               The face of Aglaë crimsoned, and she hastily said:
               "Oh, Madame, this is jumping to conclusions rather too rapidly. General Ney is a
                  remarkable man; he is one any woman may be proud to win, but my interest in him
                  arises from his inexplicable resemblance to one who lies in an obscure grave.
                  While we spoke together, it seemed to me that my lost friend stood before
                  me—older, but not graver than in those early days; for Michel had known great
                  suffering, and my childish caresses first brought smiles to his sad lips, after
                  the blow that struck him to the earth."
               "What, then, was the source of his sorrow?"
               "We never knew; he carefully concealed his past life. We only knew him as our
                  benefactor, and as one possessing the noblest and tenderest of souls. After the
                  service to which I have referred, he frequently visited our chateau, and became
                  one of our best friends."
               "Tell me of this exploit. How did he rescue you, and from what danger?"
               Aglaë, with vivid eloquence, related the escape of the leopard, and the gallant
                  attack made on him by Rudolph. Hortense listened with intense interest, and when
                  the recital was finished, she said:
               "This is just such an act as the daring courage of Ney would lead him to perform.
                  Napoleon has remarked him in the front of battle, and he says that such cool
                  impassive skill and valor as he exhibits is unequalled even among the brave
                  warriors who have won their laurels under his leadership. Weigh well what I have
                  said, Aglaë, and do not permit a romantic dream to mar the brilliant destiny that
                  may be yours."
               Aglaë smiled faintly, made some light reply, and soon afterwards took leave of her
                  friend to return to her father's hotel in Paris.
               Wrapped in strange perplexity, alarmed at the new and thrilling emotions that
                  assailed her, she recalled the expression of the eyes that had lately rested on
                  her, and feared to analyze the new feelings that had been aroused in her heart.
                  During the horrors of the French Revolution, M. St. Angeau, like many other
                  wealthy landed proprietors in France, had been driven from his chateau, which was
                  plundered and burned.
               After trying many vicissitudes, in which he narrowly escaped the all-devouring
                  guillotine, he made his escape with his wife and daughter to Geneva, where they
                  lived till the restoration of order in his native country. Then he returned to
                  France, gathered up the wreck of his fortune, and became a banker in Paris. He
                  possessed much financial talent, and soon became conspicuous for his daring and
                  success. Wealth flowed in apace, and now he occupied a handsome hotel in Paris,
                  and lived in a style of elegance suited to his prosperous fortunes.
               Aglaë St. Angeau and Hortense Beauharnais had been placed in the same school, and
                  there the intimacy sprung up which resulted in a warm attachment between them; though until this day, Aglaë had never
                  before spoken so freely of her childish romance. Hortense vaguely knew that some
                  tender memory prevented her friend from responding to the overtures of the lovers
                  which her beauty and fortune drew around her; but how deep a hold this past
                  affection had upon her heart she was far from comprehending.
               Aglaë sprang up the steps which led to her mother's apartments, entered her
                  exquisitely furnished boudoir, and threw herself in the maternal arms with a burst
                  of emotion that alarmed her.
               "What is it, my daughter? What has happened to excite you thus," tenderly inquired
                  Madame St. Angeau.
               "Oh, mamma, I have seen Michel's wraith; a man who looks, speaks, moves as he did,
                  yet he cannot be the same. I feel like one who has been walking in a dream for the
                  last few hours."
               "Michel! Ah, I hoped that fantasy had passed away, Aglaë. It is not well to let a
                  phantom from the dead stand between you and happiness. Your father and I think it
                  quite time for you to be settled in life, and he is becoming impatient at your
                  refusal of so many eligible offers of marriage. He was with me but now, and spoke
                  with displeasure of your rejection of Count D'Ernonville. He is young, handsome,
                  and of ancient family; what more can you ask in the husband you may choose?"
               "Only to be able to love him," replied Aglaë, with some bitterness. "Why shall I
                  be forced to marry, when I already have all that is necessary to my happiness?
                  Since you and my father are so anxious to get rid of your only child, I promise to
                  accept the next suitor that presents himself. There, Madame, I hope that will
                  satisfy you."
               She threw herself back upon her chair, pale and excited, and her mother regarded
                  her with astonishment.
               "Aglaë, never before have you spoken to me in this manner ner. What has happened
                  to you, my child? The next suitor may be one your father and I will not approve,
                  so make no rash pledges."
               "Oh, I do not, Madame. I have seen my new admirer; he wears the semblance of my
                  early friend; and if my heart ever responds to love, it will be to that which he
                  offers me. General Ney has seen me in public, he was presented to me this morning
                  by the First Consul himself, and I have reason to believe that he will soon seek
                  the acquaintance of my father and yourself."
               "General Ney is a gallant man, and a distinguished officer, but he has risen from
                  the people, and the young count would have been a more suitable match for a St.
                  Angeau. Though your father is now a banker, Aglaë, I do not forget that we are of
                  as good blood as any family in France."
               "True, ma'ma," replied Aglaë, tranquilly, "but events have changed all that. A man
                  of the people rules France, who has summoned around him a band of heroes that
                  carry all before them. General Ney looks far more like a prince than did the late
                  King of France, if his portraits do him justice. His origin is veiled in the
                  splendor of his achievements, and since it is your will that I marry, you must
                  accept this plebeian as your son, or do without one."
               "Child, I do not know you under this new phase of character. Why should you resent
                  the natural desire of your parents to replace you in the sphere in which you were
                  born! Count D'Ernonville can give you rank and position; he is of the ancient
                  noblesse, and he is an excellent young man besides."
               "Oh yes—mawkish as a goblet of sweetened water. I will not marry the count, but if
                  General Ney asks my hand I will give it to him. I do not place this noble,
                  self-made man on a level with the dainty aristocrat, who seeks me because my
                  probable fortune will restore the tarnished lustre tre of his own. If I accept a husband at all, it
                  shall be one worthy of the sacrifice I make to your wishes and those of my
                  father."
               Aglaë arose, swept out of the room, and went to her own apartment to draw forth
                  the miniature she had shown Madame Louis, dream over it, and marvel at the tender
                  interest with which she already regarded the stranger who so strongly resembled
                  it. A secret attraction which she could not fathom, seem to draw her toward this
                  acquaintance of a few hours' standing, and she felt a sort of self-contempt that
                  already, in spirit, she had broken her vow to the dead.
               Aglaë appeared at dinner paler than usual, but most becomingly dressed, and her
                  father viewed her toilette with approbation. Toward the close of the repast, M.
                  St. Angeau said:
               "I expect a call from a very distinguished man this evening, and it is my wish to
                  present him to you, and to my daughter, Madame. I hope you have no engagement
                  which will take you from home?"
               "We had one, but I have sent an excuse, as Aglaë declines going out."
               "So much the better, for General Ney is not a person to be slighted, and I wish to
                  offer him the hospitalities of my house."
               "General Ney! Is he to be our guest?"
               "Is there anything extraordinary in that? Nearly all the Republican generals have
                  been received here; and as he comes to me with an introduction from the First
                  Consul himself, I shall extend to him every courtesy that lies in my power."
               Madame St. Angeau glanced toward her daughter, but she sat calm and impassive. She
                  comprehended that beneath that quiet exterior lay a deep resolve, and, with a
                  sigh, she gave up the hope of calling the young count her son. She was a tender
                  and judicious mother, and she soon reconciled herself to her disappointment, with
                  the consoling thought that her daughter would at last marry—that her future
                  husband was one of the rising men of the day, whose fame would compensate for lack
                  of high birth.
               When they were again alone, she tenderly kissed Aglaë, who comprehended from this
                  action that her mother conceded to her the right to fix her own destiny. She
                  returned the caress, and whispered:
               "You will see your future son to-night, mamma, and I know beforehand that you will
                  like him."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               THE BETROTHAL.
               M. ST. ANGEAU was alone in his private sanctum when a servant announced General
                  Ney. He advanced to meet his guest, and as the light fell upon his features he
                  started back, and surveyed him with an expression of surprise and doubt.
                  Recovering himself, he said:
               "Excuse me, Monsieur, but your air and manner brought a deceased friend so vividly
                  to my memory, that for an instant I could have believed him before me. You are
                  welcome beneath my roof, General, as are all the gallant defenders of France."
               "Thanks, M. St. Angeau; it is my desire to be well received by you, for you hold
                  in your hands my future happiness."
               The voice of the speaker was slightly tremulous, and he was evidently much moved.
                  St. Angeau listened with surprise, but he courteously said:
               
               "What can I do to serve the friend of the Ruler of France? I do not know in what
                  manner I can be instrumental in promoting your happiness, Monsieur."
               "I have seen your daughter, and I came hither to ask your permisson to woo her as
                  my future wife?"
               The father smiled, and then a cloud flitted over his brow."
               "General, my daughter is a singularly capricious young creature. She has refused
                  many brilliant offers, and declares her intention to remain single. I have
                  combatted this idea in vain, and I despair of gaining her consent to give her hand
                  to any one."
               "Why is this? Has any previous disappointment caused this resolution on the part
                  of so charming a woman as Mademoiselle St. Angeau?" asked Ney, with emotion, for
                  he felt as if the child he had so tenderly loved should, in her fair maturity,
                  belong to himself alone.
               "It results from no serious entanglement. A mere childish fancy for one who saved
                  her life many years ago, induces my daughter to devote herself to his memory. The
                  person I refer to is dead, but Aglaë is peculiar, and she chooses to cherish his
                  memory to the exclusion of any living lover."
               While M. St. Angeau thus spoke, he earnestly regarded his companion. The light
                  that flashed from his eyes, the smile that swept over his expressive mouth,
                  revealed the exultation with which this assurance was received. Ney decisively
                  said:
               "With your permission, I will endeavor to win the heart of your daughter; this
                  childish memory cannot be so tenacious as to preclude all hope of success."
               "If any one can do this, General, it is yourself; for you are marvellously like
                  the friend of whom I have spoken. Nay—it seems impossible that you should not be
                  the same. Michel, why do you wear a mask to me? What is the mystery of your life?
                  If you really seek to gain the hand of my daughter, why should you shrink from
                  revealing your identity to one who is bound to you by such deep obligations?"
               Ney frankly grasped the hand that was extended to him, and his voice vibrated with
                  deep feeling as he said:
               "I sought to woo your daughter as General Ney, but as Michel I alone would have
                  married her. I wished, for a season, to maintain my incognito, but you have
                  penetrated it, and now I have only to relate to you the singular series of events
                  which have placed me in my present position; but this must be done under the
                  strictest pledge of secresy."
               "Assuredly, if you wish it. But why have you so long consented to remain as dead
                  to your best friends?"
               "That has been a source of bitter regret to me; but the course I pursued was
                  imposed on me by imperative necessity. Listen to the story I have to relate, and
                  then you will comprehend all the difficulties of my position."
               The two drew their seats nearer together, and in low earnest tones Ney related the
                  strange incidents which led to his adoption of his present name, and gave him a
                  captain's commission in the French army. He then lightly sketched his career since
                  that epoch; it had been signalized by many brilliant services to the country, for
                  which he had been rewarded by the high rank he now bore.
               When he had finished M. St. Angeau said:
               "It is a strange, wild story; but I do not see how you could have acted
                  differently toward your friends. Your secret was too important to be left at the
                  discretion of others. But how have you managed with reference to the family of
                  your deceased cousin? Have they never suspected anything?"
               "My life has been too busy to afford me an opportunity to visit them, and you can readily comprehend that
                  I was not anxious to be brought in contact with those before whom I should have
                  been compelled to play a part. I have been liberal to them; more so, perhaps, than
                  their son would have been, for I felt that I had a debt to cancel. And now that
                  all has been satisfactorily explained, what answer do you make to my proposal for
                  the hand of your daughter?"
               "Only win Aglaë's consent, and you have mine," was the frank response. "Your
                  supposed death nearly cost the poor child her own life, for she was ill for months
                  after the news arrived. I believe the picture her mother painted of you has been
                  the shrine of her devotions ever since. In all our vicissitudes she managed to
                  preserve it, and it still hangs in her chamber."
               Ney listened with rapture. He said:
               "Ah! how sweet is this new hope that dawns on my weary and broken life. In my
                  youth I loved with desperation a woman who crushed my self-respect—who trampled on
                  my bleeding heart, and inflicted on me the most exquisite torture. The sweet voice
                  of the child I saved first awoke me from the torpor of despair, and I loved her as
                  the messenger of peace and hope. I have cherished her in my soul as its good
                  angel; I scarcely hoped to meet her again; but a few weeks ago I saw her at the
                  theatre. I felt attracted by her, I could not tell why, for, lovely as she is,
                  there were others as fair around her. I enquired her name, and then I knew that
                  Fate had led me to her presence again. The past love is buried, M. St. Angeau, and
                  your daughter is now the only woman on earth that I would willingly marry. I will
                  endeavor to make her happy, if I am so fortunate as to gain her affections."
               "I feel assured of that, my dear General; and now shall we join the ladies?"
               "If you please."
               "Is it your wish to maintain your incognito toward them?"
               "For a season, at least. If I succeed with Aglaë, you can communicate to them the
                  secret I have confided to you-if she refuses me, it will be useless to reveal my
                  identity."
               "Ah! the knowledge of that will almost ensure your success."
               "It may be so; but I wish to see if Aglaë is gifted with your penetration. The eye
                  of love should be at least as searching as that of friendship."
               "She will detect you, be sure of that; for now I look at you closely, hear your
                  voice, I can see only the Michel of former days. You are many years older; but
                  they have passed lightly over you, and you are handsomer than in your early
                  youth."
               "Ah, that is a consoling assurance to a man who aspires to become a bridegroom.
                  Let us seek the ladies. The glimpse I had of Aglaë this morning only increases my
                  desire to see more of her."
               "You have seen her, then?"
               "Are you not aware that the First Consul presented me to her this morning at
                  Malmaison?"
               "And the sly gipsy said nothing of it to me, although I told her at dinner that
                  you would call this evening. There is something unusual in this, for Aglaë is
                  ordinarily as frank as a child, and speaks of what interests her without reserve.
                  Come at once, for I am curious to see the meeting between you."
               M. St. Angeau led the way to the drawing-room, in which he found his wife and
                  daughter. Aglaë was playing on the harp, but she turned with perfect
                  self-possession to greet the visitor. Madame St. Angeau, prepared for the
                  resemblance between Ney and their former friend, betrayed no emotion, and M. St. Angeau was disappointed in
                  the effect he expected their entrance to produce.
               Aglaë seemed to awake to new and more vivid life in the presence of this stranger,
                  for her parents had never before seen her so brilliant and fascinating as on this
                  evening. She seemed inspired with eloquence, and when she sang, at Ney's request,
                  her pure voice sounded as the echo of a happy spirit suddenly released from doubts
                  and fears that had long oppressed it. He listened as one entranced, and as her
                  hand fell from the harp-strings, he took it in his own and earnestly said:
               "I cannot feel as a stranger to you, Mademoiselle. It seems to me that, in some
                  former state of being, we must have known and appreciated each other."
               Aglaë drew back her hand with an air of reserve; but suddenly her eye fell upon a
                  small mole on his temple, from which he had pushed back his hair. She uttered a
                  faint cry, clasped his hand in both her own, and vehemently said:
               "My heart has not deceived me. Yes, we have known each other, but it was on this
                  earth; though why you have played so cruel a part toward the friends that loved
                  you I cannot understand."
               Their eyes met in one lightning glance, and he whispered in a voice of deep
                  emotion:
               "Aglaë, do you indeed recognize me? Will you consent to love me as you did the
                  Michel of other days?"
               "Then you are indeed he?" and she sunk upon a seat completely unnerved by the
                  discovery she had so suddenly made.
               In her childhood Aglaë had often toyed with his hair, and the small brown mark
                  which had betrayed him had often been observed by her. M. St. Angeau was watching
                  them, and Ney made a sign to him which he immediately understood stood. He saw
                  that an explanation was about to take place, and he considerately withdrew his
                  wife that he might give her the clue to what was passing.
               Madame St. Angeau listened in amazement, and with difficulty her husband prevented
                  her from rushing back to claim her old friend and welcome him to her house.
               When they were left alone, Ney leaned over the half fainting Aglaë and tenderly
                  said:
               "Yes, dearest Aglaë, I am that Michel who was once permitted by Heaven to rescue
                  you from imminent peril. Tell me that I then saved the joy and hope of my life and
                  I shall be the happiest of men."
               The young girl impulsively drew from her bosom the medallion she had that morning
                  shown to Madame Louis Bonaparte, and smiled brightly as she said:
               "Look—behold yourself, and know that I have vowed from childhood that I would be
                  true to the original."
               He cast one rapid glance upon the miniature, clasped her to his heart, and
                  whispered:
               "Then you will be mine? I can explain all that is past to your satisfaction. I
                  have already done so to your father, and he brought me himself to test the power
                  of your memory."
               She extricated herself from his embrace, and stood tearful and blushing before
                  him.
               "I have perfect faith in your honor. I can trust you with all that is most
                  precious to me, and I answer that the wish of Napoleon shall not be thwarted. I
                  give you my hand, and with it the heart that has always clung to you."
               "And I accept it as the most precious boon that fortune can bestow. Oh, my life
                  was once laid desolate by a demon; but now an angel will chant the song of love in
                  my home, and my heart shall cherish her more dearly than it ever did that fair
                  syren who wrought me such bitter woe."
               
               "Bury that memory in oblivion, and let us plant flowers over its grave," said
                  Aglaë with an enchanting smile. "I can well remember that you were a man of
                  sorrow; that my childish wiles brought back smiles to your lips, as I will now
                  bring back joy to your heart."
               "That you have already accomplished, my sweet love. In this hour, I would not
                  exchange my fate for that of any living man. Oh, to feel that the one we love is
                  worthy of perfect trust, is sweetest balm to the heart that has suffered from
                  treachery as mine has suffered."
               A smile of ineffable tenderness beamed from Aglaë's eyes, as she led him to a
                  sofa, and seated herself beside him. Then she playfully said:
               "I am a genuine daughter of Eve, and I am impatient to learn the history of your
                  life since we last met. Tell me all, for even the most minute incident that
                  concerns you, will have deep interest for me."
               An hour was passed in explanations, during which many digressions were made, and
                  then Ney asked:
               "Will you now bear the name I have won and made glorious for your sake? For in my
                  heart a tender presentiment ever lingered that I should again find you, and claim
                  you as the jewel of my life."
               She naïvely said:
               "I feel as if I of right belong to you. Such has ever been my feeling, and this it
                  was which prevented me from accepting the offers of others. My heart comes to you
                  in all the purity and singleness of a first love; see how perfect is my confidence
                  in you, for I speak as freely to you as in those infantile days when you bore me
                  in your arms, and endured all my teazing, tantalizing ways with the patience of a
                  martyr."
               "Say rather all your angelic wiles to bring back smiles to the weary lips that
                  closed upon the despair that was in my heart. Dearest Aglaë, you have indeed been
                  an angel of hope and blessedness to me."
               "And that early life, Michel?" she tenderly asked. "What was that sorrow which
                  bore so heavily upon you? Have I not the right to know it?"
               "The time will come, Aglaë, when I can tell you all; but not now. In this hour ask
                  me not to recall the anguish of those days; it would be like placing a death's
                  head amid a feast of flowers. I will not now sadden your heart and my own, by the
                  recital of that which I would gladly cast into oblivion. Let us contemplate the
                  bright future that opens before us, and forget the dark and tortuous path through
                  which it has been gained."
               M. St. Angeau became impatient at this long interview, and at length he came in,
                  and drew near the lovers. Ney arose to meet him, and grasped his hand, as he
                  said:
               "Your daughter's penetration proved equal to your own, my friend. She knew me,
                  though by what token she has not yet explained."
               Aglaë also arose, and pointed to the mole upon his temple. She said:
               "My heart had already recognized you before I saw that betraying mark. I was then
                  assured of what I had before suspected."
               "Then my daughter has at last found her true mate?" asked M. St. Angeau, with a
                  smile.
               "We ask your blessing," replied Ney, drawing Aglaë's hand within his own. "We have
                  come to an understanding, and Mademoiselle St. Angeau will be my wife."
               "And you ask mine too, I hope," said a sweet voice which vibrated with emotion,
                  and Madame St. Angeau advanced from the adjoining apartment. "Dear Michel, I know
                  all, and I pardon you for your long silence, though we have mourned you as dead.
                  But you have come back to us, and all is well."
               
               Ney took the hand she offered, and pressing it to his lips, spoke with deep
                  emotion:
               "Ah, Madame, your generous goodness overwhelms me. I ask you for the darling of
                  your heart, but I will not take her from you. I only ask to be received as a son
                  who will make the happiness of your child the study of his life."
               "And I fully comprehend that my daughter is most fortunate in the choice she has
                  made," replied the mother.
               "And I ratify the contract," said M. St. Angeau, with joyful pride. Aglaë was
                  right to wait till the true man appeared; though I have often been impatient with
                  her coldness and caprice toward the pretenders to her favor. Come, let us sit
                  down, and cozily talk over what has happened, and what must soon follow in the
                  train of these events."
               "Yes," replied Ney—"I have a few weeks of leisure, and my happiness must not be
                  delayed. Make my life complete by giving me my bride as soon as may be."
               Aglaë ventured a few faint objections to this haste, but they were overruled, and
                  it was settled that in two weeks the marriage should take place. In a few days
                  their betrothal should be announced to the First Consul, and thus become known to
                  the circle to which they belonged.
               Supper was announced, and four happier hearts have seldom gathered around the
                  evening meal. The lovers felt that they had at last gained the bourne of peace for
                  which they had so long sighed, and the parents were elated by the brilliant future
                  which lay before their beloved child. As the wife of a distinguished military
                  chieftain, they knew that her position would be far more eligible than even as a
                  countess of the ancient régime, and they were also warmly attached to their
                  proposed son-in-law.
               They separated at a late hour, with a promise from Ney to dine with them on the
                  following day; and Aglaë went to her room to muse over the incidents of the
                  evening, and to give up her heart to the great and unexpected happiness which had
                  so suddenly dawned upon her.
               She compared her cherished picture with the original as he now appeared, and
                  decided in her own mind that Ney was far handsomer than the sad-looking Michel of
                  other days.
               Every hour that the lover could spare from the business which brought him to Paris
                  was devoted to his betrothed, and it was not until the third day after her
                  betrothal that Aglaë found time to drive to Malmaison to inform her friend, Madame
                  Louis, of what had taken place. At the same time Ney went to announce his
                  approaching marriage to the First Consul.
               Napoleon heard it with surprise, and merrily said:
               "By my faith, General, you storm ladies' hearts as expeditiously as you take the
                  enemy's batteries. This young lady has hitherto refused all lovers, yet you, like
                  Cæsar, can say, 'I came, I saw, I conquered."
               "Such has been my good fortune, my General; but Madame Louis can probably explain
                  to you that I owe my success to a strong resemblance between myself and one to
                  whom Mademoiselle St. Angeau has been attached from her infancy."
               "Ah, well, women are strange riddles, and the sentimental ones the most
                  incomprehensible of all. But Mademoiselle St. Angeau is a clever girl, and I think
                  will not be less true as a wife because she has cherished absurd fancies. You will
                  cure her of all these, and make her a sensible woman."
               The listener smiled, but he did not explain that he owed his happiness to those
                  very fancies which rendered Aglaë different from the most of her sex.
               When Aglaë, with many blushes, and much internal perturbation, revealed to her friend that she was
                  already won by a man Hortense believed to have been known to her but a few days,
                  she was relieved by the sweet and womanly manner with which her communication was
                  received. Madame Louis kissed and congratulated her on the choice she had made,
                  without referring to the brief wooing. She spoke only of the future, and the
                  happiness in store for the bride elect, and Aglaë parted from her with a stronger
                  feeling of attachment for her than she had ever felt before.
               As she was taking leave, Hortense said:
               "There will be a grand reception at the Tuilleries this week, and you must appear
                  there with your betrothed. Ah, dear Aglaë, many hearts will envy you the noble and
                  handsome cavalier you have chosen."
               "Or, rather, who has chosen me. I shall certainly come, and on that occasion my
                  dress shall be something unique. I shall wear it as a delicate compliment to him
                  who so strongly resembles him to whom I owe my life."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               THE LIFE-CURSE REAPPEARS.
               MADAME BONAPARTE, in anticipation of the state she was soon to assume, resided in
                  the ancient palace of the Kings of France. Josephine was still a beautiful woman,
                  and her unrivalled taste in dress set off her charms to the best advantage. On
                  this evening she wore a regal robe of purple velvet embroidered with gold, and a
                  head-dress of emerald sprays, mixed with golden ears of wheat. She sat in an
                  arm-chair at the upper end of the reception-room, surrounded by the members of her
                  husband's family.
               Conspicuous among them was the lovely Pauline, in the dress of a Greek Bacchante,
                  which admirably set off her perfect beauty. Madame Murat, with her rose-tinted
                  complexion, fine as satin, and her sweet expression, stood near her sister, and on
                  the other side were Hortense, and the wife of Lucien Bonaparte.
               The First Consul, with his brilliant staff of officers, occupied a position nearer
                  the door of the saloon, and the plain gray dress of Napoleon contrasted strangely
                  with the gay crowd by which he was surrounded; yet a stranger suddenly introduced
                  into the apartment would at once have detected that in this unostentatious figure
                  centred the chief interest of the scene.
               Napoleon, with his grand head, and eagle eye, seemed to tower above those around
                  him in spite of his small stature when compared with that of the magnificent Murat
                  and others who stood near him. This man, crowned with genius and daring, knew that
                  he held the fate of France in the hollow of his hand, and his bearing showed that
                  he was master, though there was nothing arrogant or supercilious in his manner. He
                  eminently possessed the power to win hearts, and although many saw whither his
                  ambition tended, no effort was made to clip the wings of the imperial eagle as he
                  soared upward to grasp the glittering prize of a crown.
               Ney, with his handsome face, and stately form, was amid the group that surrounded
                  the First Consul, and he listened anxiously for the announcement of M. St. Angeau,
                  with his wife and daughter. The saloon was already crowded, but an open space was
                  kept clear for the approach of new guests to pay their respects to the wife of the
                  ruler of France.
               At length those for whom the lover had so long watched made their appearance, and
                  an exclamation escaped him as he saw Aglaë's dress.
               
               She wore a white cashmere robe, trimmed with bands of plush, woven in imitation of
                  the mottled skin of the leopard, over which fell a tunic adorned with the same
                  material. This was clasped upon the shoulders with cameos of great beauty, on
                  which were cut the couchant form of a leopard. The white and rounded arms were
                  adorned with bracelets to match, and her wealth of raven hair was bound around her
                  graceful head with a bandeau of the same jewels.
               In this severely simple toilette she looked like a muse, and a murmur of
                  admiration greeted her appearance; but she passed on, with the serene dignity that
                  distinguished her, and made her obeisance before the elegant Josephine. The latter
                  arose from her seat, and offered her congratulations to Mademoiselle St. Angeau on
                  her approaching marriage. They were received by Aglaë with a blushing grace that
                  rendered her still more charming in the eyes of the gentlemen present, and it was
                  soon circulated through the crowd that the reserved and proud Diana had at last
                  found one she considered worthy of her love.
               The fame of the gallant Ney was known to all present, though few were personally
                  acquainted with him, for his life had been too active in the service of the
                  country to afford him much time to mingle in the gaieties of Paris. When it became
                  known that the distinguished-looking chieftain who stood near Napoleon was the
                  betrothed of Mademoiselle St. Angeau, she became the centre of a brilliant crowd,
                  who vied with each other in flattering the young girl who had become the object of
                  his choice.
               Ney was endeavoring to obtain a glimpse of his betrothed, when another
                  announcement was made:
               "The Baron and Baroness Maretsky;" and the crowd opened to admit a tall man, with
                  tawny hair and whiskers, on whose arm leaned a gorgeous figure, glittering in a
                  blaze of diamonds.
               Madame Maretsky advanced with the stately and assured step of one accustomed to
                  such scenes, but suddenly her eyes fell upon the face of one who stood beside
                  Napoleon, and her face, even her lips, blanched to the hue of death. She tottered,
                  grasped the arm of her husband, and muttered:
               "I am faint—the crowd overcomes me—take me away!"
               Ney, who had been watching Aglaë, had not looked toward the newly-arrived guests;
                  but suddenly that peculiar perfume which Alina always used was wafted toward him,
                  and he became dizzy and heart-sick at the memories it evoked. He looked around, to
                  ascertain from what quarter it came, and his eyes met those of the false and cruel
                  woman who had long believed him dead.
               In that glance he saw that he was recognized, but he coldly turned his eyes away,
                  determined to maintain his incognito at all hazards. A goblet of water was offered
                  to Madame Maretsky, and she recovered sufficiently to go through the ceremony of
                  presentation, but immediately afterward she retired in a tumult of surprise and
                  anger. Before she slept she ascertained that the person who had so deeply moved
                  her was General Ney, with whose reputation she was already familiar. Alina also
                  learned that he was on the eve of marriage with Mademoiselle St. Angeau, a
                  beautiful and wealthy heiress.
               After all her victim had escaped her! and he had almost achieved the brilliant
                  destiny predicted for him by the old astrologer. Alina felt the certainty in her
                  own mind that this man and Rudolph were one though how he had baffled her, and
                  risen to such a height as to place him beyond her reach, she could not divine. She
                  dared not again strike at the life of one of Napoleon's cherished friends, lest
                  the blow might recoil upon herself; but she could strike him through his
                  betrothed; and she seized a pen, and wrote to M. St. Angeau:
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MONSIEUR:—Your daughter is about to bestow her hand upon a man who
                              has a wife yet living. He is not a Frenchman, but an American, who
                              fought in the struggle for freedom in that country, and retired from
                              the army with the rank of Major. His true name is Rudolph, and he is
                              the son of humble though respectable parents. He lived unhappily with
                              his wife; on her account gave up name and country, and came hither as
                              M. Michel, having dropped one letter from his baptismal name to make
                              that soubriquet.
                           "Show this letter to him, and ask him if he dares deny the truth of
                              the statements I have made.
                           
                              A FRIEND."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Alina took measures to have this missive secretly delivered, at an early hour on
                  the following morning, and then she threw herself upon the couch to snatch a few
                  hours of repose.
               Years have passed away since we last looked upon her, but she has scarcely
                  changed; the same fair and delicate complexion, the same bewitching grace of
                  manner and softness of expression which could bewilder and allure those she
                  considered worthy of fascinating, were still hers; but her heart was as hard as
                  the diamonds with which she delighted to adorn her person, and the sway which
                  circumstances had given her over others was felt as a bondage of iron. Imperious,
                  stern and haughty to her inferiors, the wife of the Russian magnate ruled as a
                  Princess over the serfs that had become her husband's by inheritance.
               After years of bitter struggle and poverty, the elder brother suddenly died, and
                  as he had no children, Maretsky became his heir. On the day of Robespierre's
                  downfall he had been wounded and imprisoned; but he was of too little importance
                  to share the fate of the fallen party, and after a few days detention he was
                  released and permitted to leave France.
               Baffled in her attempt to obtain possession of Ida De Vere, his wife accompanied
                  him to Vienna, where she remained with Madame L'Estrange, while Maretsky
                  frequented the most noted resorts for gamblers, and lived upon the spoils he thus
                  gained.
               Such was the existence they led till the death of the Baron gave his younger
                  brother possession of the family estates and title.
               Maretsky returned at once to Russia, but Alina soon grew weary of the barbaric
                  splendor with which she was surrounded, and insisted on returning to Paris. The
                  tastes of her husband also led him to prefer a gayer life, and they had now been a
                  week in the city preparing to entertain in the most splendid style. This was her
                  first appearance in public, and the haughty Baroness felt as if Fate had dealt her
                  a cruel blow in presenting to her her hated foe in the hour of her anticipated
                  triumph. She felt as if she could never know repose till she had fathomed the
                  means by which Rudolph had so long led her to believe that he was no longer
                  numbered among the living.
               On the following morning, M. St. Angeau sat over a late breakfast with his wife
                  and daughter. He smiled upon the latter, as he said:
               "You looked charmingly last night, my daughter, and I was complimented and
                  congratulated on every side on the brilliant prospects before you. Ah, if those
                  people only knew the romance of this affair, what a talk it would make."
               "Yes," replied Algae, absently, "but Michel, for I must always call him by that
                  dear name, Michel appeared ill at ease and annoyed when he joined me. He seemed
                  greatly struck by that brilliant Russian Baroness, and made many inquiries about
                  her. Do you know anything of her, mon père? It
                  was asserted that she was a French woman."
               
               "I believe she is, for I was told that in her youth she was attached to the court
                  of Marie Antoinette. Before the fall of the monarchy she gave her hand to this
                  Baron Maretsky, and, I believe, has lived in Russia since her marriage."
               "Then Michel could not have known her in other days."
               "Ha! ha! Aglaë, I hope you are not jealous already. No—Michel does not know her, I
                  am sure."
               At that moment a servant entered, bearing a letter on a silver waiter. He
                  presented it to M. St. Angeau, who turned it over and examined the dainty
                  rose-colored envelope in which it was enclosed, before attempting to open it. He
                  laughed as he said:
               "Madame, this is certainly from a lady, but I hope that you do not share the
                  infirmity of your daughter, who seems ready to torment herself with jealous
                  fears."
               Madame St. Angeau smiled serenely.
               "If you do not shew me the contents of you billet, I do not know that I can answer
                  for myself."
               He broke the seal, glanced over the lines within, and uttered an exclamation of
                  dismay. Aglaë was aroused from her dreamy reverie, and asked:
               "What is it? Why are you so pale and angry, dear father?"
               His flashing eyes were turned upon her, but tears sprang to them and dimmed their
                  angry glare as he thought of the humiliating revelation which had just been made.
                  Madame St. Angeau snatched the letter, ran her eyes rapidly over its contents, and
                  exclaimed:
               "Oh! my child, my daughter, what will become of you?"
               "Good Heavens! what is it? Let me see—let me read for myself."
               Her father would have withheld the letter, but Aglaë insisted on seeing it, and as
                  she read she became pale as marble. She summoned courage to say:
               "It is but an anonymous accusation, and deserves little attention. Michel will
                  soon be here, for he promised to call this morning; he can easily defend himself
                  from such a charge as this."
               The noise of an arrival was at that instant heard, and M. St. Angeau said:
               "Let us receive him in your boudoir, Madame, for the interview that approaches
                  must be strictly private."
               He supported the trembling form of his daughter to the apartment indicated, into
                  which Ney was ushered immediately afterward. He looked bright and animated, but
                  the expression of the faces before him chilled him at once. He paused in his
                  advance toward Aglaë, and asked:
               "Has anything happened, that you regard me so strangely?"
               "A very extraordinary thing has happened, Monsieur," said M. St. Angeau, "which I
                  require you to clear up as becomes a man of honor. Read this letter; it is
                  anonymous, it is true, but if it reveals facts, you dare not deny the assertions
                  of the writer."
               Ney took the letter, and the sudden paleness that overspread his features was
                  perceptible even beneath the bronzed complexion of the soldier. His hand trembled,
                  and his haughty lips grew tremulous over this last evidence of Alina's undying
                  hatred to himself. He dropped the billet as if it burned his hand, and with a
                  mournful glance at Aglaë, said:
               "The writer states facts well known to her, for she was once my wife."
               Aglaë uttered a cry and buried her face in the cushions of the sofa on which she
                  had thrown herself. M. St. Angeau, in a voice that trembled with anger, said:
               "And you—you have dared to woo my daughter as your wife. Monsieur,
                  this is——"
               
               "Stop!" said Ney, in that voice of stern command which could ring like a trumpet
                  tone over the wildest tumult of the battle field—"say nothing which may hereafter
                  demand an apology. Listen to my story, and then judge my conduct. Before Heaven I
                  avow that I have committed no act for which a man should blush in the presence of
                  his betrothed wife. Aglaë, raise your head, place your hand in mine, and thus shew
                  your confidence in the man you have professed to love."
               Obedient to his command, the young girl raised herself, and mechanically put forth
                  her cold hand. She endeavored to smile, but the attempt only ended in a hysterical
                  burst of tears. Ney clasped her hand, and held it next his heart, as he said in a
                  voice of deep emotion:
               "It is a brave and loyal heart, Aglaë, and it beats only for you; therefore let
                  your own respond to the revelation I am about to make. I have promised you a
                  history of my early life, and I came hither this morning to offer it; for last
                  night I again encountered my evil genius, and I knew that she recognized me. Yet I
                  scarcely expected her hatred to have forestalled me thus. M. St. Angeau, it has
                  never been my purpose to wed your daughter, without first disclosing the facts
                  which that letter reveals; but in the first flush of my happiness, I could not
                  bear to recall that wretched and humiliating record."
               "Yet if your wife still lives, by what right do you seek another?"
               "Is there not such a law as divorce? And may not a man fairly consider himself
                  free when his wife has fled from him, and been twice married herself since then?
                  In the land of my birth, an absence of seven years gives back freedom to both
                  parties. More than twice seven have elapsed since she who was my wife deserted me,
                  and I consider myself quite free to form new ties. Is it not so, Aglaë?"
               "Only prove to me that I have the right to think so," said Aglaë, feverishly. "I
                  must not—I cannot lose my faith in you, Michel."
               "Nor shall you, dearest. Listen to the tragic story I came hither to unfold, and
                  grant me the continuation of your love as my consolation for the bitter ordeal
                  through which it has been my lot to pass."
               Then, with rapid eloquence, Ney related the incidents of his early life; his
                  passionate adoration of Alina, and the return it had met; the vengeance he had
                  taken on Sir Lionel De Vere, and her subsequent attempts to have him assassinated.
                  Nothing was concealed, and at the conclusion of his narrative, M. St. Angeau
                  frankly said:
               "I am satisfied, Monsieur. You have acted throughout as a man of honor, and my
                  daughter has nothing to complain of; no reasonable bar to your union exists."
               Aglaë shuddered; she faintly said:
               "Ah! does not this woman still live? and has it not been said: 'Whom God hath
                  joined together, let no man put asunder?'"
               "Aglaë," said her lover, "Alina and I have been long enough separated to give a
                  divorce in any country, and her subsequent conduct has rendered our union null and
                  void. Speak now, for I will not be trifled with: accept my hand, or finally reject
                  it. I have explained everything, and I feel that in honor and good faith I can
                  make you my wife."
               Thus pressed for a decision which something in the tone of the speaker's voice
                  told her would be final, Aglaë glanced upward at his noble face, she felt the
                  clasp of his tender hand as it held hers a prisoner against his heart, and she had
                  not the courage to risk losing him. Her head sunk upon his bosom, and she
                  murmured:
               "Dearest Michel, I am yours. I am satisfied that this bad woman should not have
                  the power to separate us."
               
               "Dear love, your decision is just," said her mother, tenderly kissing her, and the
                  cloud which had gathered so heavily rolled away, leaving the future bright and
                  smiling as before it threatened to burst.
               Preparations for the marriage went rapidly forward, and to her intense chagrin,
                  Alina heard nothing of the rupture of the engagement. She was preparing to send a
                  second warning, when a reply to her first one came from a most unexpected quarter.
                  An order from Fouché, minister of police, reached her, commanding her to leave
                  Paris within forty-eight hours. While stupefied by this blow, a note, without a
                  signature, was brought to her, which she mechanically read:
               
                  "MADAME—You will recognize the hand from which this comes, for it is written to
                     warn you against the repetition of your late attempt to injure one whom fortune
                     has now placed above your reach. Know that the history of your past life as
                     connected with my own, that the infamous attempts you have caused to be made to
                     destroy me, are all written down, and placed in the hands of a friend, who will
                     make them public in case of my sudden death by means not perfectly well
                     understood.
                  "I have baffled your petty malignity by revealing the whole truth to my
                     betrothed, and thus your infamous history is known to others beside myself. I
                     advise you to accept, without delay, the sentence of exile which reached you
                     to-day, as I have reason to know that it will be enforced."
               
               Oh! cruel fate! to be banished from the only city in the world she considered
                  worth living in! and through the influence of a man she believed she had crushed
                  and destroyed. It was too humiliating! but there was no resource but obedience,
                  and to her great surprise, Maretsky submitted to the decree with a degree of
                  equanimity which was unaccountable.
               He did not tell her that the minister of police had detected his collusion with
                  one of the numerous plots against the life of Napoleon, and contented himself with
                  including him in the banishment pronounced against his wife, without exposing him
                  to further punishment.
               Baffled, but not subdued, Alina left Paris for Vienna, there to devour her soul
                  with rage in thinking of the happiness of the two she so cordially detested,
                  Rudolph and Helen, and planning new schemes of vengeance against them both.
               Her son was now eighteen years of age, and she began to think it time to put
                  forward his claims on the inheritance of his father. With that tenacity of purpose
                  which distinguished her, she had never for an instant relinquished the idea of his
                  eventually becoming Sir Lionel De Vere, and she only awaited his coming of age to
                  bring him forward as the legal heir to the baronetcy.
               The youth was handsome, but effeminate in person, and he possessed none of the
                  mental energy of his mother. He showed but one strong feeling, and that was his
                  attachment to his faithful nurse. Betty was as devoted to him as in his infancy,
                  and she stifled the cry of her conscience when she looked upon his face and
                  thought of the sin she had incurred for his sake.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               GOOD FORTUNE.
               AGLAE could not consent to give up her lover, but she had many misgivings as to
                  her right to assume the place of a
                  woman who was still living. Her doubts made her wretched, and she saw the
                  preparations for her marriage go on with a sinking feeling of dread very different
                  from the serene joy with which her heart had lately been filled.
               Her parents would not listen to the feeble objections she found courage to utter,
                  and her confessor, to whom she applied for advice, took their view of the position
                  in which she was placed. She yearned for a friend on whose judgment she could
                  rely, who would either confirm her doubts or set them at rest forever.
               Such a one came when she was least expected. While living in Switzerland, M. St.
                  Angeau's family had accidentally made the acquaintance of a sister of charity who,
                  like themselves, had left France to avoid the horrors that were perpetrated there
                  during the Terror. A trifling service led to an intimacy which ripened into a warm
                  friendship.
               This lady had now for many years resided in England, but she returned twice each
                  year to France to make inquiries concerning a friend to whom all clue had long
                  since been lost.
               Aglaë sat in her room pale, languid and depressed, when her maid came in with a
                  joyful face, and announced Sister Therèse. The young girl arose and threw herself
                  in the arms of her beloved friend.
               "Ah!" she exclaimed, "Heaven has sent you to me when I most needed you. Dear
                  Sister, what has brought you hither at this unusual season?"
               "A haunting presentiment that my presence was needed; that by coming I should
                  solve a mystery which has been the object of my life for years past. If I can be
                  of use to you, dear Aglaë, I shall feel repaid for my journey, even if I should
                  fail in accomplishing that which brought me hither."
               "Yes, I need you—I need a clear head and a strong heart to counsel me in this
                  crisis of my life. But sit down, take off your hood, and make yourself comfortable
                  before I begin a long story."
               Sister Therèse complied, and while doing so, she surveyed the clouded face of her
                  young friend with deep sympathy. When she was at last established in a large chair
                  in front of the fire, with Aglaë on a cushion at her feet, she said:
               "In what can I aid you, Aglaë? You know that in other days you often made me your
                  conscience-keeper; let me again assume that office, for you look as if something
                  is pressing heavily upon you."
               "That is precisely what I wish; but this is a much more complicated case than you
                  ever judged before. But first, I must place you in the position of my confessor,
                  and exact from you a pledge of profound silence, for what I am about to reveal is
                  the secret of another, and of vital importance to him."
               "I give you my word that it shall be as sacred as if revealed in the confessional.
                  You may speak with perfect openness."
               Thus assured, Aglaë briefly related the events of the last ten days; but in her
                  own self-absorption she did not heed the emotions that swept over the face of the
                  listener when she spoke of the history of her betrothed. When she repeated the
                  contents of the anonymous letter, Sister Therèse suddenly laid her cold hand on
                  that of the speaker, and said:
               "You speak of Michael Rudolph? he alone can be the hero of this story."
               "What! you know him! You call the name which has been renounced for many years?
                  How, then, have you learned it, for I have not spoken it."
               "You are aware that for years I have sought to discover traces of a lost friend;
                  that friend was Michael Rudolph. Under what name is he now known, dear Aglaë?"
               
               "My betrothed husband, General Ney, was known to you as Michael Rudolph. His wife
                  yet lives; tell me, I conjure you, if I dare accept his hand while that baleful
                  woman stands as a bar between us."
               Dora shivered, and for an instant her heart stood still; but she recovered her
                  self-possession, and regarding the earnest, pleading face that was lifted to hers
                  with tender sympathy, she asked:
               "Aglaë, do you love this man with all your heart?"
               "I do—I cannot give him up, though my religious scruples are all against giving
                  him my hand. Oh, Sister Therèse, set them at rest if you can; but, above all, tell
                  me what will be right for me to do."
               Dora quelled the tumult of feeling in her own heart at this unexpected discovery.
                  Her affection for Rudolph was now that of a tender sister, and after a few moments
                  reflection she said:
               "Alina Derval rent the tie that bound her to Rudolph. She declared it illegal, and
                  gave her hand to Sir Lionel De Vere, though of course no tribunal would
                  acknowledge the validity of the second marriage. She has since been united to her
                  present husband, and I cannot see that Rudolph was wrong in considering himself
                  free to woo you as his wife. Legally he is certainly free; morally, I consider him
                  equally so."
               Aglaë listened with eager interest, and she grasped the hand of the speaker and
                  covered it with kisses.
               "You are my best friend, Sister Therèse. I accept your decision, and I will cast
                  these tormenting doubts away, and be happy with him I love so dearly."
               Sister Therèse kissed her tenderly and asked:
               "When will he be here? Since he is great, honored, and happy, he does not need me;
                  but I yearn to behold him once more. I am his countrywoman: I knew him in his
                  youth; he was a brother to me, and as his sister have I sought him through these
                  long years."
               "Tell me of my hero; speak to me of those early years in which you knew him;"
                  entreated Aglaë.
               Dora related as much of the past as she deemed necessary, and the young girl
                  seemed as if she would never weary of questioning her; but their conversation was
                  interrupted by the announcement of General Ney, and with a bright smile on her
                  lips, and a brilliant flush upon her cheek, Aglaë left her friend alone while she
                  sought the presence of her lover.
               Dora had revealed her true name, and Aglaë had promised to prepare her early
                  friend for the meeting between them. Ney was struck by her joyful air, and he
                  said:
               "You look bright and happy, my Aglaë. I have been alarmed at your lassitude and
                  want of life since my unhappy story became known to you; but to-day you seem
                  restored to your true self."
               "And so I am, thanks to the efforts of one I love and trust. Oh! I am very happy
                  to-day, for I shall restore to you a devoted friend from whom you have long been
                  parted."
               "Who can it possibly be?" he asked bewildered.
               "You have heard me speak of Sister Therèse; I told you of our meeting in Geneva.
                  She is here; she is a countrywoman of your own, and for years she has sought for
                  some clue to your fate. Now, can you not divine her name?"
               "There is but one woman on earth who would think me worth seeking after, and that
                  one is Dora Calvert; though how she can be here and under that name I cannot
                  imagine."
               "It is not more strange than that you should be here under your present name.
                  Yes—Sister Therèse is Dora Calvert, and
                  she comes to be present at our marriage. I leave her to tell you of the years of
                  wandering in search of the friend who is at last found."
               She opened the door leading into her boudoir, led Dora forward trembling and pale
                  and left them together.
               "Dora, dear sister."
               "Michael, my brother," were the words that escaped their lips as they clasped
                  hands and looked into each other's eyes, to read there the tender fraternal
                  affection which united them.
               Long and earnest was the conversation that ensued. Dora ended it by saying:
               "The long-sought is found, and I am happy. I believed that you would need me, and
                  I have found it so. I have laid at rest the scruples of a too sensitive
                  conscience, and Aglaë will be yours. To know that you are prosperous and happy
                  will give joy and peace to my life."
               "Share that life with us, dear friend. Let our home become yours, and thus enable
                  me to repay the debt of gratitude I owe to both yourself and your father."
               "I will visit you often," she tranquilly replied; "but my home is with friends I
                  love, and their young people have become very dear to me. Lady De Vere is as a
                  sister to me, and her adopted son is also my protégée."
               Ney would have combatted this decision; but Dora would not be moved from her
                  determination, and she presently unclosed the door of communication and summoned
                  Aglaë to join them.
               "Our explanations are ended, and again your lover is all your own," she said with
                  a sweet smile; and the three sat together until the entrance of Madame St. Angeau
                  to welcome her old friend broke up the conversation.
               On the appointed evening a brilliant wedding took place, to which Sister Therèse
                  remained. Among the guests was the First-Consul, with whose subsequent career that
                  of his bravest general is so intimately blended. The predictions of the astrologer
                  were in time fulfilled, for the American backwoodsman became Marshal under the
                  empire, Duke of Elchingen, and finally Prince of Moskwa.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               CONCLUSION.
               WE must return to England, where the last scene in our drama was enacted.
               It is summer, and the trees around Vere Castle are all in their beauty. A group is
                  gathered on the lawn, consisting of Lady De Vere, her friend, the young Ida, and
                  the adopted child. The daughter of the house has developed into a charming girl;
                  and the little, half-starved waif, that was so strangely picked up in France, has
                  grown into a handsome youth of seventeen summers.
               There is often in the eyes of Helen a yearning tenderness as she looks on him, and
                  thinks that such as he is her son might have been. Henry is bright, affectionate,
                  and truthful; and he has gained a strong hold on the affection of his friends.
               The sound of a horse's hoofs is heard approaching, and Sir Reginald, with stern
                  brow and compressed lips, dismounts, and draws near the group. His greeting was so
                  unusual that Lady De Vere apprehensively asked:
               "Has anything happened to annoy you, Sir Reginald?"
               "Yes," he briefly replied; "I have just received another letter from Madame
                  Maretsky, informing me that she is on the eve of embarking for England to enforce
                  her son's rights to the inheritance of
                  his father. Lionel is now of age, and she demands that I shall either bestow upon
                  him the hand of my daughter, or acknowledge him as the heir after my death. I
                  should care very little about so absurd a claim if she were not coming here in
                  person to annoy me."
               "Alina will not attempt to enter my house," said Lady De Vere. "You
                  can meet her in London, and prove to her the futility of this persecution. Our
                  daughter cannot become the wife of her son, nor will the law recognize him as the
                  legal heir."
               "That is true, but it wounds me to have this old story brought up again, and made
                  the subject of gossip. I should think that Madame Maretsky would shrink from such
                  an exposé herself."
               "Alina shrinks from nothing that can wound or annoy me," said Helen, sorrowfully;
                  and the husband and wife returned together to the house, to confer on what was
                  necessary to be done. The result of their consultation was, that Sir Reginald set
                  out for London on the following morning, and ten days passed away before he again
                  returned.
               He had heard nothing further from Madame Maretsky, but a terrible storm had
                  occurred during his absence, and many vessels had been wrecked in the channel.
                  Uncertain of her fate, and weary of awaiting her appearance, De Vere left
                  instructions with his lawyers, and returned to the beloved home in which all his
                  happiness was centred.
               Sister Therèse had gone out to take an evening stroll on the day after his
                  arrival; in the park she encountered a wretched, toil-worn woman, who stopped her,
                  and inquired if the family were at the castle.
               "Yes—Sir Reginald and Lady De Vere are there; have you any business with
                  them?"
               The woman pressed her hands hysterically upon her throat, and answered almost with
                  a cry:
               "Yes—I have come to tell them what will hang me! but the vengeance of God has
                  overtaken me, and I care for nothing now. My darling—the light of my eyes—is gone,
                  and I do not care to stay behind him."
               For an instant Sister Therèse thought the stranger deranged, but the past flashed
                  upon her mind, and she felt assured that the abductor of the heir was before her.
                  She seized the hand of the woman, fearful that her courage might fail her, and an
                  attempt to escape be made, and hurried with her toward the castle.
               Betty passively submitted, for she had come hither to make such reparation as now
                  lay in her power, careless of the consequences to herself. Breathless and excited
                  Sister Therèse entered the room in which De Vere and his wife sat, who regarded
                  with surprise the wretched figure that accompanied her.
               This pallid apparition rushed forward, threw herself upon her knees before Sir
                  Reginald, and began to pour forth a torrent of supplications, mingled with
                  lamentations, which for several moments it was impossible to comprehend. But soon
                  a terrible light began to dawn on him: this woman had stolen his child, and the
                  theft would have been concealed to her dying hour, but for the retribution which
                  had overtaken her.
               He for whose sake the crime had been committed was dead—lost at sea with his
                  mother, and, almost by a miracle, the wretched nurse had been saved. She believed
                  that God had granted her a few more days of life, that such atonement as was now
                  possible to her might be made. She had begged her way to the castle to relieve her
                  conscience of its heavy burden before death claimed her as its own.
               Betty at length paused, and De Vere asked in faltering tones:
               "Where then is my son? What have you done with him through all these long
                  years?"
               
               "I took the baby to France and placed him with a woman in the country to be
                  nursed. When he was a year old I put him in the basket that receives foundlings at
                  one of the charitable institutions in Paris. Since then I know nothing of him. I
                  left France with my lady, and in the days of the Terror the children were all set
                  adrift. Oh, sir! I know that you can never forgive me, but I am dying, and I felt
                  as if I must come and tell you this before I go."
               "And is there no clue by which we can trace our child?" asked the pallid
                  mother.
               "I put a mark on him, Madam. I pricked three letters on his left shoulder and
                  rubbed gunpowder in them. By that token I hoped to know him again."
               "And those letters—what were they?" was the breathless inquiry of De Vere.
               "S. F. E., with the date of the year on which he was taken away. The letters stand
                  for stolen from England, for I was afraid to put the initials of his own name upon
                  him, lest they might lead to discovery.
               Lady De Vere arose, threw herself in her husband's arms, and said:
               "Was it not a voice from Heaven that told me to claim him? My own—my
                     own boy! Oh, sister Therèse, bring him hither, that I may clasp
                  him to my heart as my recovered treasure."
               In a few moments the youth entered, looking surprised and bewildered at the scene
                  that met his eyes, and those feelings were increased by the rapidity with which
                  Sir Reginald laid bare his shoulder and commanded the stranger to look upon it.
                  Betty glanced at the mark, and clasping her hands, said:
               "The ways of God are wonderful! This is your son, sir. That is the mark I put upon
                  him, but how he came here I cannot understand."
               "That shall be explained, and since he is here, I forgive you for the
                  crime you committed; for the years of wretchedness you have given me. A few more
                  days and your earthly account will be rendered; God forbid that I should attempt
                  to punish one whom He has already dealt with."
               Exhausted by her efforts to reach the castle, Betty was indeed in a dying
                  condition; but she lived long enough to give a detailed account before a
                  magistrate of everything connected with the abduction of the heir. His identity
                  thus established, he was acknowledged amid great rejoicings.
               The Life-Curse was removed, and the two families she had persecuted enjoyed peace
                  and happiness.
            
            THE END.

            T. B. PETERSON AND BROTHERS,
            PUBLISHERS AND BOOKSELLERS, PHILADELPHIA, PA.,
            Take pleasure in calling the attention of the public to their Choice and Extensive
               Stock of Books, comprising a collection of the most popular and choice, in all styles
               of binding, by all the favorite and standard American and English Authors.
            
               To Collectors of Libraries, or those desiring to form them.
               Many who have the taste, and wish to form a Library, are deterred by fear of the
                  cost. To all such we would say, that a large number of books may be furnished for
                  even One Hundred Dollars—which, by a yearly increase of a small amount, will
                  before long place the purchaser in possession of a Library in almost every branch
                  of knowledge, and afford satisfaction not only to the collector, but to all those
                  who are so fortunate as to possess his acquaintance.
               For the convenience of Book buyers, and those seeking suitable Works for
                  Presentation, great care is taken in having a large and varied collection, and all
                  the current works of the day. Show counters and shelves, with an excellent
                  selection of Standard, Illustrated, and Illuminated works, varying in price to
                  suit all buyers, are available to those visiting our establishment, where
                  purchases may be made with facility, and the time of the visitor greatly
                  economized. Here may be seen not only books of the simplest kind for children, but
                  also exquisite works of art, of the most sumptuous character, suitable alike to
                  adorn the drawing-room table and the study of the connoisseur.
               Our arrangements for supplying STANDARD AMERICAN BOOKS, suitable for Public
                  Libraries and Private Families, are complete, and our stock second to none in the
                  country.

               Benedict.
            MAMMOTH COLORED FASHION PLATES Ahead of all others. These plates are engraved on
               steel, TWICE THE USUAL SIZE, and contain six figures. They will be superbly colored.
               Also, a pattern, from which a Dress, Mantilla, or Child's Dress can be cut out,
               without the aid of a mantua-maker. Also, several pages of Household and other
               receipts; in short, everything interesting to ladies.
