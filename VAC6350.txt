                  This is a weird, and powerfully told story. It is the history of but one week spent by a helpless and charming young girl, in a country house in Louisiana, in the early portion of the present century. What she found there, and what she suffered, is depicted in a most graphic manner. From the commencement to the end the interest never flags, and few who begin to read the story will be willing to lay it down till the last page is finished, and the mystery solved, which adds a supernatural terror to the life of the old tyrant, who is inaccessible to every other fear.

            PREFACE. 
            FOR the historical portions of the following story, the reader is referred to a discussion in the New York papers many years ago, on the question of "Have we a Bourbon among us?" 
            Much evidence was brought forward to prove that the Rev. Eleazer Williams, a Canadian missionary, was the son of Louis XVI., and Marie Antoinette. If he had no claims to such paternity, it was at least very singular that a son of Louis Philippe should be sent across the Atlantic, for the purpose of conferring with an obscure Canadian priest.

               CHAPTER I. 
               AN EVIL HOUSE AND ITS STRANGE INMATES. 
               IT was a sombre-looking mansion, that great pile of dingy stucco with mildewed stains upon its crumbling walls, caused by the dampness of the climate, and the heavy shade of trees of tropical growth, matted together by trailing wreaths of Spanish moss which swayed to every breeze, and gave a most funereal aspect to the neglected woodland that surrounded it. 
               The house was built on the plan of a chateau which had been the ancestral home of the Montreuil family. A cadet of that house emigrated to Louisiana with Bienville, enjoyed opportunities of amassing wealth through the favor of the Governor, and laid the foundation of a large fortune. 
               At a vast expense, he erected with very inferior materials this building, on the exact plan of his early home, and thus in a newly settled country was found a chateau which, from the effects of the climate, looked as if it might have been built ere yet Columbus had made his great discovery. The house was three stories in hight, and the highest one was lighted by dormer windows, with a heavy parapet in front of them extending the whole length of the roof. It was full of odd corners, angles, and winding corridors, leading into nooks that would never have been suspected by a stranger. 
               A pair of octagon towers, of later date than the main building, were in front, connected by a gallery, open above, but closed below, to which access was gained by a heavy door, bearing a brass knocker. 
               What had once been a wide and well kept lawn, was now covered with unpruned vines, shrubbery, and weeds, so matted together as to form a complete jungle. The place appeared to be abandoned to silence and neglect, and at the first glance it seemed improbable that so desolate a spot was inhabited; but a closer scrutiny betrayed a few signs of occupation. 
               The narrow windows in the upper story of the eastern tower were open, and a faded curtain fluttered in the evening breeze. 
               From the deep shadows of the lawn an observer would soon have detected a narrow pathway leading to the rear of the house-pursuing this over the neglected and uneven parterre through which it wound, the view widens and discloses a vegetable garden in good order, on which a cabin opens. A small grass plot was in front of it, and a vine bearing crimson trumpet-shaped flowers, was trained over the humble portal. A shelf beneath it sustained a water-bucket, and milk pans set out "to sun," as the old negress expressed it, in whose charge they were kept. 
               She sat near the door spinning, and a picturesque figure was old Eady, with her ebony face surmounted by grizzled tufts of wool, half covered by a scarlet bandanna handkerchief, and ornamented with heavy hoops of gold, pendant from her ears. A calico dress of many colors, that rivalled in brilliancy those of Joseph's celebrated coat, extended only to her ankle, where it met a stout brogan, designed more for use than ornament. 
                
               An old-fashioned wheel was kept busily humming while the negress converted a pile of carded cotton into yarn for her future knitting. The face of the old woman was shrewd, sensible, and good-humored, and she evidently found much interest in her occupation. 
               Suddenly she lifted her head, and looked toward the declining sun, and words, spoken in a strong Virginia accent, broke from her lips: 
               "I clar' to Moses ef 'taint mos' nite, an' dat ole dunce o' mine aint got back yit. I wonder what new scrape he's gone and got inter now. De las' time he went to de offis for letters he drunk so much 'fernal whisky dat I was impelled to blow him up, de ole fool! Ef he comes back agin in such a pickle, oh Lor'! I don't know what I shan't be tempted to do to him. Ef de marster only knew what I knows, what would come o' de bones in dat black nigger's body, I wonder." 
               She half laughed as the words escaped her, for she recalled Pierre's drunken vagaries with evident internal enjoyment. After a few more moments of watching, Eady put aside her wheel, and with the ease of a practised hand commenced her preparations for an epicurean supper. That she was an accomplished cook was soon evident, for coffee of most delicate aroma, crisp cakes, and delicious broiled birds were speedily prepared with the skill of a true artiste. 
               These were served on fine porcelain, and then placed on a silver waiter covered with a napkin of spotless purity. When all was ready, she again took a survey from the door, and returned to raise the tray to her head, as she discontentedly murmured: 
               "De marster's supper's all ready, an' my ole man aint fotch de letters yit, dat he am so anxious to git. I'm mos' 'fraid to take it up widout 'em; an' I's more 'fraid not to go to onct, caze he'll storm de ole tower down ef I d'lays my usual sarvice. Oh Lor'! oh Lor'! what does make dat Pierre sich a born numscull?" 
               With a sigh she poised the waiter lightly upon the folds of her crimson turban, then with quick steps she threaded her way through the garden, opened a side door leading into the house, and entered a wide echoing corridor which made several abrupt angles before it ended at the base of a staircase leading to the second story of the eastern tower. 
               Doors from long disused apartments opened from this passage, and in the gathering twilight it seemed, to the imagination of the superstitious negress, filled with dusky shadows, and her eyes dilated visibly as they rolled from side to side, half in expectation that the doors would unclose and some grim phantom thrust forth its hideous mocking face, and leer at her as she passed upon her way. 
               To the superstitious fancy of the unlettered black, it was sufficient that human life had ceased to animate these apartments to people them with shadowy existences from another world. Eady could have told many a thrilling tale of faint whispers, rustlings of dress, and echoing steps, made by viewless beings who flitted beside her in her evening jaunts through the old mansion. 
               The dread in which she held her living master might be measured from the fact that she forced herself to encounter these impalpable beings sooner than fail to take to him his evening meal at the usual hour. 
               The corridor was crossed by a wider one at the front of the house, from which ascended a spiral staircase leading to an upper gallery, on which the front towers opened. The railing of this stairway was of carved mahogany, and the steps as well as the floor of the lower hall, were of inlaid wood. The evening sun struggled through the dense woodland without, and lighted this portion sufficiently to show that the frescoed walls were mildewed and falling to decay from neglect and damp. 
                
               Yes, it had evidently been a great mansion in its palmy day, but the pride which once sustained its grandeur was laid low in the dust; the hopes that clustered around the hearth of the old homestead were buried in the abyss dug by passion and crime. A blighting curse seemed to hang around the old walls, and the curse of evil passions and unbridled temper certainly dwelt with the solitary old man who lived in that lonely tower. 
               Eady gained the upper floor, and, after a momentary pause in front of her master's door, knocked gently upon it. No answer came, and she muttered, apprehensively: 
               "Bress de Lor'! de coffee 'll git cole, an' marster's temper'll get hot, an' we'll have a 'splosion. What ar' he doin', I does wonder." 
               Again she rapped-this time louder-and a gruff voice called out: 
               "Can't you come in without all that knocking? Get in with you, you old jackdaw, and don't stand out there till my supper is not fit for a pig to eat." 
               Thus bidden, the old woman entered a lofty room, of large size and unique adornments. A long table occupied the centre of the floor, on which books and artist's materials were promiscuously scattered; beside this stood an easel, on which was a covered picture. The room was an octagon, and in one of its eight compartments was a fireplace; on one side of this was a well-filled bookcase, in the other hung a large oval mirror, which, on examination, was found to be slightly concave. Then came two windows, occupying the entire width of their respective angles; a third window in front left two spaces upon the wall for the exercise of the artistic talent of their owner, of which he had not neglected to take advantage. 
               In the first, three figures were represented near a ruined column, the capital of which had fallen off, and lay amid a pile of stones at their feet. The central figure evidently represented Mortality, for death had spread its pallor over her features, and she held in her hand an inverted torch, the ancient emblem of extinguished life. The man and woman, who sat with their backs toward her, though their faces were turned in such a manner as to enable them to examine her attentively, evidently were intended to represent human kind, turning away from the evidence of their own mortality, yet anxious to behold their latter end. 
               The second compartment showed an escaped spirit, as having first passed through an open portal into a dusky region, in which he seems to be feeling his way with lingering and uncertain steps. A beautiful woman, fondling a serpent, waits to receive him into immortal life, for the serpent has, from great antiquity, been considered as an emblem of renovated youth, from the annual casting of his skin. 
               These pictures were not original conceptions of the painter, but simply copies from casts taken from the antique. 
               A couch, placed near the front window, and a few chairs, completed the furniture. In one of the latter sat the owner of the place. This was a man over sixty years of age; tall, wiry, and brown-his hair whitened to silver, and his face wrinkled and worn more by temper than by time. His black eyes, deep set, vivid as a flame, flashed beneath heavy overhanging brows; and his straight nose, thin lips, and firmly curved chin, all spoke of indomitable will and unflinching purpose, though at moments there was a singular dilation of the pupil of the eyes, which gave an expression of wildness amounting to ferocity to the marked features. 
               It was the face of a man who had sinned, suffered, but never repented; and as the long, slender hand was stretched out to replace the book he had been reading, it was not difficult to imagine the nervous clutch with which it would close upon a dagger and drive it home to the heart of one who had injured him. 
               He seemed to have worked himself into a passion at the trifling delay in the appearance of his evening meal, and he glared on the old woman as she entered and placed the waiter before him as he growled: 
               "Humph! So you managed to get in at last, madam. Pray, why did you not enter at once, as I bade you?" 
               "Because I didn't hear you," replied Eady, in an irritated tone, for she too had a spice of temper, and she had made the notable discovery that the only way to manage the singular being she had to deal with, was to retort upon her master occasionally in his own tone. 
               He glanced at her with an ominous frown, and then disdainfully examined the delicate repast prepared with so much care. He asked, in a voice of extreme irritation: 
               "How now? Where are the letters and papers for which Pierre was sent?" 
               "He hasn't come back from de offis yit, Monsher. 'Deed you needn't flare up so, an' look as ef you meant to eat me instid o' yer supper, 'case I aint to blame for Pierre's idsincrazys, for I do think the drop he will take when he's out o' my sight makes him sin and crazy too for that matter." 
               The deep-set eyes flashed angrily upon her, but the absurd pun upon the long word she was fond of using, caused the listener to burst into a wild laugh, which sounded so harsh and mirthless that it was far from reassuring the old woman. She folded her hands before her, and assumed an expression of stubborn endurance, which was perfectly familiar to her master. 
               "Ah, ha!" he said; "so you've come to me in one of your iron moods tonight, old woman; but fire smelts iron, Jackdaw, and I am a son of flame. Vulcan was my father, and At my mother; so you had better beware how you arouse the evil temper within me." 
                
               "'Deed, sir, I had no such intent; an' ef At was yer mother, I think her name orter teach you that vittles aint good to eat when dey gets cole. You'd better eat my rice cakes an' drink your coffee, sir, while dey is fit to put into a Christian's stomach." 
               "Ha! ha! your advice is good, Jackdaw, and I believe I'll take it; but I will wager anything you like-a new turban for yourself or a fresh bottle for Pierre, that you consider my stomach as belonging to anything but a Christian, in spite of your form of speech." 
               Eady inwardly chuckled at being so thoroughly understood, but she demurely replied: 
               "'Deed, sir, I should be sorry to think sich a thing o' you. I allers tries to bide by the Scripter sayin', 'judge not lest ye be judged,' and I tries myself to practise dat charity what covers a multitude o' sins." 
               "Hem-and in that pharisaical spirit you excuse my short comings. Very well. Now go and see if that wretched old rum-bottle, Pierre, has returned with my letters. It will not be well for you to come back without them, I can tell you." 
               Thus dismissed, the negress left the room, and the recluse slowly ate his supper, as if he luxuriated in the only sensual indulgence now left to him. He was not a gourmand, but a true bon vivant, who ate only the most delicate and appetizing viands with a gusto which enabled him to do entire justice to the merits of the cook who prepared them. Eady knew this perfectly well, and it gave her a sense of security in her humble position, in spite of the unbridled temper with which she had to contend. 
               M. Lecour finished his repast, leaned back in his chair, and luxuriated in the recollection of its merits. To one of his restless temperament, a few moments sufficed for this, and he began to feel impatient for the appearance of the letters which circumstances rendered of unusual interest to him. 
               He arose and walked up and down the large room with his hands clasped behind his back; at first his steps were slow and regular, but they gradually quickened as his impatience gained the mastery, and the emphasis with which they were struck upon the floor increased, until a perfect storm of sound filled the old tower. Twilight began to deepen, and words were soon added to the clatter of his boots upon the floor. 
               "Curse the wretches! will they never come with a light? Am I, I to be left here till darkness gathers around me? Is it not enough to be alone, always alone in the deep hours of night, even with lamps burning around me, but must I be left to fight with the phantom in this awful gray twilight? He there-lights, lights, I say, or I will wreak my vengeance upon you, you miserable, inefficient idiots!" 
               He glanced wildly around in the gathering twilight, and his face became livid as his eyes fell upon the mirror; within it was reflected the shadowy outline of a figure in white, enveloped in a filmy veil that covered her whole person. He looked around the room, saw nothing which could be the substance of that shadow, and with a shriek that ended in a hoarse rattle in his throat, he fell heavily upon the floor. 
               The noise of his fall quickened the uncertain footsteps that were now heard approaching, and the cracked voice of old Pierre called out querulously: 
               "Come on, Eady, for de love o' Heaben, for de ole marster is in one o' his tantrums. I carnt see my way befo' me, it's so dark down here. Come faster wi' de light, or he'll strangle me when he comes to hisself." 
               Thus admonished, the old woman came almost on a run, carrying a wax candle in each hand, for in the maudlin condition of her husband she was afraid to trust him with either. Pushing past him, she quickly entered the apartment; Pierre followed her more slowly, and his great eyes rolled around the walls with an expression of affright, before they fell on the prostrate form of his master. 
               M. Lecour lay with eyes widely staring, and froth issuing from his lips. It was a piteous sight, that old silver-haired man lying there, with his locked features of an ashen hue, and an expression of utter anguish and fear impressed upon them. 
               "Ah! it is the White Terror again," whispered Eady, as she stooped to raise his head from the floor. "This cussed ole house is to be de death of us all yit. I wish de ebissary would set it afire an' burn it down outright." 
               "His-s-sh, ole 'oman, his-s-he. Ef de marster was to hear dat wish, he'd murder you sure enough." 
               "Murder me, indeed!" she contemptuously retorted; "I reckon he's had too much to do wi' sich deviltries as that aforetime, or he wouldn't be so easily scared now. Besides, he'll be glad to keep me alive as long as he lives, dat I may 'pare his vittles as he likes 'em. No-I aint 'fraid o' him, but ef you pokes your ugly phizhogamy where he will see it de fust thing when he comes to, he'll be sure to pitch inter you, thinkin' ole Sam have sent one o' his ebissarys to fotch him to de 'fernal regions." 
               Pierre had been leaning over his master, but at this uncomplimentary caution he suddenly drew back, looked into a mirror which formed the door of the bookcase, and internally acknowledged that it would be no unnatural hallucination on the part of his master; for a more ungainly specimen of the black man could scarcely have been produced than himself. 
               Dwarfed in size, with crooked limbs, long heels, and the ape-like face which is so often the heritage of the pure-blooded blooded African, that it is impossible to doubt his affinity to the monkey tribe, the old negro, by no violent effort of the imagination, could easily have been mistaken for an agent from the Inferno, by a man half demented by the solitary life he led, and the memory of events in which he had taken a part, which shed a lurid horror over his daily existence. 
               Eady sprinkled water over the pallid features of her master, chafed his chilled hands, and presently he unclosed his eyes and looked around with an expression of vague terror. He shivered convulsively, and muttered: 
               "It was a shadow evoked by my own fantasy. My eyes are diseased; I-I must consult an oculist. Lift me up, Jackdaw; help me into my large chair. There-I am well again." 
               He sunk back upon the well-worn seat, and closed his eyes a few moments; then suddenly arousing himself, he sharply asked: 
               "Where is Pierre, and what has become of my letters?" 
               "I's here, marster, an' dis is de passel de young man at de offis gin me for you." 
               Pierre came forward rather unsteadily, holding a waiter on which he had placed several newspapers, and conspicuously above them two packages bearing a foreign postmark. His master surveyed him leisurely and searchingly, and grasping one of the papers, he hurled it contemptuously at his head as he exclaimed: 
               "Drunk again, you old baboon! Get out of my presence, and leave Jackdaw to wait upon me." 
               Though mortally afraid of the darkness and loneliness without, and the airy shapes with which his superstitious imagination peopled the old mansion, the negro stood in even greater dread of his irritable master. He hurriedly consigned the waiter with its contents to his wife, and retreated, though he took good care not to go beyond the threshold of the door, which he closed very imperfectly. 
               In the transfer, one of the letters slipped down and rested against the other package, with the address toward M. Lecour. His eyes fell upon it, he gasped, grew paler than before, and Eady thought he was about to fall into another spasm, but he recovered immediately, clutched the letter with an expression of ferocious endurance, and examined the writing as he muttered: 
               "This should have been written by the dead, the hand is so much the same as hers. Pooh! I am a fool! It is but the same writing taught to every girl who is educated in that convent. Ha! from my beloved grand-daughter." 
               The sardonic emphasis upon the endearing epithet revealed a whole history of estrangement, wrong and bitterness; he tore open the envelope, which contained two letters, one from the lady superior of the convent, the other from his young relative. Giving precedence to that of the elder lady, he unclosed it and read the following lines: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "PARIS, CONVENT OF LA MERE DE DIEU.
                            
                           "M. LECOUR:-In consequence of the failure of the agent to settle the account due for Mademoiselle Adrienne Durand's board for the last year, I decline to retain her any longer under my protection, unless she will consent to assume the veil. In her position, it will probably be best for her future happiness and respectability to abjure the world and all its vanities, but I regret to state that she by no means agrees with me in these views. 
                           "With the ardent impulsiveness of her years and temperament, she declares that death will be preferable to seclusion from a sinful world, which her imagination decks with most deceptive attractions. She has been permitted to cultivate an intimacy with a classmate who is the daughter of a high dignitary of state, and on two occasions she has visited her at her father's chateau. This was against my own judgment, but the position of Mademoiselle Le Grand's family is such that I could not very well refuse a favor petitioned for by her. This young lady has a cousin who is represented as handsome and insinuating, and I am afraid his flatteries have made a deeper impression upon your young relative than is desirable, for she seems very miserable since her return to her old duties. 
                           "I desire to have your views with regard to the future destiny of my interesting charge. Is it your wish that she shall take the veil? You have never positively stated your intentions with regard to her, and therefore she has been permitted to exercise a degree of liberty which I am now half disposed to regret. Armed with your authority, the Bishop, aided by Father Eustace, who is a most eloquent and subtle pleader, will place before this refractory young girl such an array of arguments in favor of entering the sisterhood over which I preside, that no alternative but submission will be left. 
                           "You must be aware that only as one of ourselves can we, without further expense to you, retain Mademoiselle Adrienne till her reversionary expectations are realized. If she takes the vows, there will be no further demand upon your fortune while you live to enjoy it yourself. At your death, the estate must descend to her as your natural heir, and the sisterhood, to which it will bring extended means of doing good, will offer up daily prayers for the repose of your soul. How much you will need such intercession no one knows more thoroughly than yourself. 
                           "There is another strong reason for wishing to retain Mademoiselle Durand as one of our community. She is a somnambulist, and with proper cultivation can probably be made a most interesting and valuable helpmeet Under the circumstances, we are willing to retain her without remuneration until her inheritance falls to her. 
                           "Hoping to hear from you without any unnecessary delay, I am 
                           
                              "URSULA, 
                              "Lady Abbess of La Mre de Dieu."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               M. Lecour glowered over the signature, and for a few moments seemed lost in thought. With a curling lip, he at length refolded it, and opened the other letter. This was written in a delicate, but firm hand, and the clear, upward strokes indicated strength of will that would as little brook opposition as his own. 
               It was the first communication he had ever received from the writer, for at his own request Mademoiselle Durand had not been permitted to trouble him with letters. On his part, it was an act of magnanimous charity to have educated the child of his disowned daughter in a respectable manner; and he did not choose to be annoyed either with thanks or complaints. Such was M. Lecour's view of a sacred duty. The letter ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "At last, my dear grandfather, am I allowed the privilege of addressing you. I have yearned for this indulgence, but the Superior always assured me that you had no wish to be reminded of my existence; that, as the child of a man you hated and a daughter you disowned, I am odious to you. Ah! Mon pre, this seems very hard to me, for I am innocent of offence toward you. I have no other relative on earth, and my heart naturally turns toward you as its most important object. I have always cherished a most profound veneration and affection for you. And this feeling gives me the right to appeal to you in the present crisis of my destiny. 
                           "No efforts have been spared by those around me to influence ence my mind to the choice of a conventual life, and no training could more signally have failed to attain its object. 
                           "I would sooner be thrown upon the world to gain my bread by the hardest toil, than embrace it. Save me, my mother's father-save the child of her you must once have loved, from such a fate, for I avow to you that it will be far worse than death to me. 
                           "Permit me to come to your own home; let me become the stay and solace of your declining years, for I am bright as the sunshine in my temper, lively and blithe as the birds in springtime, and I will fill your sombre mansion with the light of youth and hope. 
                           "See how attractive my egotism leads me to describe myself, but it is a happy self-conceit which enables me to depict in pleasant colors a creature whose tenderest hope on earth is to minister to your happiness in those years when the "grasshopper has become a burden, and the desire of the heart has failed." 
                           "Try me, dear sir; let me at least come to you, and if I should prove a burden, it will then be time enough to consign me to the tender mercies of the Bishop and his allies. If you refuse my prayer, I do not know what the consequences may be, for I have friends who will aid me to escape the fate I have not chosen for myself, and I declare to you that I will avail myself of their assistance at all hazards, sooner than become that aimless, hopeless being, a nun. 
                           "Dear grandfather, write to me for once with your own hand, and give me the coveted assurance that your heart and home are open to your own 
                           
                              ADRIENNE."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               The recluse read this letter twice over, and then rested his head upon his hand in deep meditation. He at length abruptly spoke: 
               "Well, Jackdaw, don't you think that a young lady, educated ucated in France with all the modern accomplishments, would have a nice time here in this old ghost-haunted house, with no one but you or me for company?" 
               Eady opened her eyes very wide, as she energetically replied: 
               "Ef she have a roof over her head, sir, I'd 'vise her to stay whar she am. Oh, Lor! what would 'come o' a young gal brung here in dis ole rattle-trap, to fret herself sick ober things she couldn't mend, not ef she broke her heart a-tryin'." 
               The listener shrugged his shoulders. He sardonically said: 
               "But if it is her own choice, what then? If no other home is open to her, what can she do but make the best of this? Besides, she wishes to come to me; prays to be allowed to take care of me in my old age. I begin to feel that I need some one in the place of your poor dumb child, who can look after--" 
               He paused-made a significant sign which Eady seemed to comprehend, for she quickly said: 
               "An' would you trust her wi' dat? even if she do come. I do think it is de berry wust notion dat could git inter a young gal's head to come to sich a den as dis ere. Who is dis young creetur, an' how is it dat she have no frien's to help her to somethin' better?" 
               "This young girl is my ward, and my house, or a convent for life, are the alternatives to choose from." 
               "Den may God help her," responded the old woman, sincerely; "an' ef I could get to speak to her, I'd 'vise her to stay wi' de nuns, sooner den come to sich a life as she'd lead here." 
               "You're a fool, Jackdaw, and always have been one. You have sunshine, food, fire, and shelter, with only work enough to keep you busy, and yet you dare to grumble, and speak of my house as if it is no fit place for my granddaughter to dwell in." 
               Eady opened her great round eyes wider than ever, as she repeated: 
               "Grand-darter, sir? I never knowed afore dat sich a chile was on de yeth. Long as I've lived in dis dismal sper-rit-haunted house, I's never hearn de fust blessed word 'bout dis young lady till now." 
               "It would be strange if you had, when it is a subject on which I take no pleasure in talking. But I have a grandchild who was born before you ever saw Louisiana-I have placed strange servants about me, that I might not be pestered with inquiries about a girl whose existence is no pleasure to me." 
               "An' ef de young lady is of your blood, why should she be sent away from her natural gardeen?" 
               "That is my affair, Jackdaw, and I do not see fit to explain it to you. I only think it is necessary to inform you that your rule in this house may be interfered with before long by a young lady, who comes at her own desire, from the convent in which she has been educated, to take charge of Castle Dismal and its queer inhabitants. I fancy she'll not stay long here, but as she wishes to come very earnestly, I think it may be as well to gratify her, and serve my own purposes at the same time." 
               Eady listened in extreme surprise. If the advent of an angel had been announced to her she would scarcely have been more astonished than she was at this unexpected revelation. She vaguely knew that M. Lecour had been married in early life; that his wife had died within a year of their union; but that a child had been the offspring of that marriage, she was profoundly ignorant till that moment. She looked so much bewildered that her master went on to explain that his daughter had not married to please him, that she died early, leaving an infant daughter orphaned and dependent. He had placed her in a convent in France, where she had received an accomplished education. 
               M. Lecour then went on: 
               "I hardly know why I have told you this news so early, Jackdaw, for it must be sometime before Mademoiselle Durand can come hither; but perhaps it is as well for you to know it now, as you will have time to reconcile yourself to the thought of a mistress. I do not think she will trouble you long, however, for I do not care to have her residence here made agreeable enough to induce her to prolong it. I only consent to her coming at all, because I do not choose to pledge myself to any future endowment to the convent that shelters her; if she should be induced to take the veil." 
               "An' you is really an' spontaciously agwine to bring a young lady wi' all sorts o' gimcracks in her brain, into Castle Dismal to fret the heart out o' you, an' herself too? I 'clar' to Moses, it's past believin'." 
               "It will become a self-evident fact before many months have rolled away. Ah-h-h-what is that? Move the lights to a better position-chase the shadows from every part of the room. Here it is! twice in the same night! Oh! the curse of my life has come back! Eady, the White Terror has again appeared to me-and there-yes-there it is again!" 
               The woman followed the wild glance of terror that he cast toward the door of the apartment which she saw was slowly opening, and a head covered with a white wrapping was cautiously protruded through the opening. She instantly comprehended that it was a ruse practised by her husband to work on the superstitious fears of her master, while he introduced at least a portion of his person into the room in which light and life were found; for Pierre had suffered untold agonies in his place of banishment, while this conference lasted. He finally wrapped the napkin from the supper tray around his black head, and, reckless of consequences, resolved to personate the white phantom which had become the terror of his master's life. 
               It was pitiable to see that strong man shiver and grow pale before this miserable attempt at ghost-playing on the part of his servant. He sank back with drops of cold perspiration starting from his brow, his form collapsed and trembling with dread. He whispered: 
               "Stand between me and the phantom shape, Eady. Shield my sight from it, and ask it what it seeks?" 
               He put up his hands to vail it from his view, but the old woman indignantly said: 
               "It's only dat ole drunken fool, Pierre, who is mortal 'feard to stay out thar by hisself, an' he's gone to play off his antics to scare you. Hi! dis chile jes wish you'd break every bone in his imperant body." 
               Her wish seemed likely to meet with speedy fulfillment, for it was no sooner uttered than her master sprang up in a perfect fury of passion, and rushed toward the door, exclaiming, in tones hoarse with rage: 
               "How dare you put that white thing upon your head! How dare you attempt to personate the baleful shape that haunts me forever?" 
               Pierre snatched the napkin from his head, caught a glimpse of the flaming eyes, livid lips flecked with foam, and the steel-like talons ready to grasp him and inflict condign punishment upon his person, and his terror of the darkness without became trifling in comparison with the real danger that menaced him from the wrath of his master. He retreated precipitately, dropping the linen on the floor just in front of the door, and the next instant the sound of a body falling from the top to the bottom of the staircase was heard. 
                
               The monomaniac paused suddenly in front of the white streak made by the discarded napkin upon the floor, and shrank back, muttering to himself. Here-entered the room, and said to Eady, in imperious tones: 
               "Go-leave me alone. I hope that stupid idiot has broken his neck, If he has, call me, and I will help you to take his body from my neighborhood." 
               Eady hurriedly lighted a small lamp, and with a look of affright hastened to ascertain the extent of the injury sustained by her husband. She found Pierre sitting at the foot of the staircase, rubbing his head with a bewildered expression; but, as he had luckily fallen on as thick a skull as ever belonged to one of his race, he had escaped without any serious injury to his ungainly person. 
               "Git up, an' git out o' dis here, you ole black porpess," was the ungracious address of his affectionate spouse, as she attempted to raise her liege lord from his recumbent position. 
               "Oh lor! oh lor!" groaned Pierre. "Aint it 'fishent punishment to fall down 'mong de witches, an' be broke all to smash, widout havin' you an' your tongue to rate me'bout it. Put your white handkercher on the step, an' ole clatter boots won't dare to pass ober it. I mus' git time to cotch my bref." 
               "Ketch your bref indeed, when you're snorin' like a grampous. You'm usin' too much bref all to onct, ole fellah, an' I 'vise you to 'conomize a leetle o' dat, as well as your sarce 'bout de master, for if he hearn dem words as you said jes' now, he'd make a white ghose o' you 'fore you'd know where you was, or what had happened to you." 
               "I wonder ef niggers will make white ghostesses," was Pierre's rejoinder, to which he ruefully added: "I's seen it sure enough, Eady. It brushed past me on de gal'ry, as I ran 'way from de ole man." 
                
               "What has you seen?" asked his wife apprehensively. 
               "De White Terror." 
               Eady gave him a violent shake, and dragged him away, as she indignantly said: 
               "You're drunk, an' you don't know what you seen. As to de master's ghose nobody's seen it but hisself, so you needn't set yourself up wi' havin' second sight. You never saw no more ghose den I did." 
               "But I did, I tell you." 
               "Ah, what was it like?" 
               "It was jes' a woman, all in white, an' it was 'bout as tall as de mistris was. I b'lieve 'twas her, too." 
               Eady paused, shook her finger solemnly at him, and said: 
               "De trufe aint in you, Pierre, but dis is de biggest whopper o' all. You seen a ghose, indeed! Go to bed, an' sleep off de fumes o' de whisky." 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               A TERRIBLE NIGHT. 
               LEFT alone, M. Lecour listened to the sounds made by the retreating pair till they died away in the distance. He then carefully fastened his door, surveyed every portion of the room, and re-arranged the lights in such a manner as to throw no decided shadows on any angle. Placing himself beside the table, he again took up the letter of the abbess, and carefully re-perused it. 
               An expression of bitter mockery flitted over his features as he read again and again a single sentence, and he sneered: 
                
               "Cleverly expressed, faith! 'Until her reversionary expectations are realized.' In plain words, till I am dead and out of the way, they will keep the girl in consideration of the rich inheritance she may claim. Ha! they don't know as much as I do about this estate, or they would scarcely calculate on the right of my grand-daughter to inherit it. It would be a good trick to let the greedy cormorants keep the girl under the impression that she is the true heiress, and when the evil one claims me, leave behind me the proof that she has no legal claim on a single acre. I have half a mind to do so, for it will be a risk to have this girl here. What can I do with her? Disgust her with life, and make her commit suicide, or take refuge in her convent again? The last is not a probable alternative, after her energetic protest against the life of a nun. The first is a little unpleasant to contemplate, as she is really bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. Ugh! I hated her father, I cursed her mother, and their child must come to me at last, to become the solace of my declining years. Ha! ha! a joyful consolation the daughter of Julien Durand is likely to become to me-me, accursed as I am among men, bearing a seared heart and withering brain; mocked at by friends, haunted by a phantom whose mission it is to avenge the dead, even before I swell their ghastly ranks. No, no, no; let her dwell amid peaceful, God-fearing women, even if the monotony of their weary existence does eat into her weary soul. Better even that, than the awful existence she must lead with me." 
               He seized a pen and rapidly wrote: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "ADRIENNE:-I dare not grant your prayer to come to me. I have no fitting home in which to receive you, and my heart is closed to every appeal from your father's child. He was my enemy-I loathed him; I hurled my malediction upon the ungrateful daughter who forsook me for him, and now you, their child, ask to be taken to my heart. 
                            
                           "It is impossible, for that heart has become a baleful flame of hate which consumes itself, and leaves no genial spot on which love can repose. I am a man blighted by the indulgence of my own passions. See, I do not throw the blame on others; I know that my career has been evil, my conduct toward those nearest to me harsh and cruel. Therefore am I left in my old age isolated, hopeless, yet not utterly wretched. 
                           "I have my own pursuits, innocent they now are, and I wish to have no further temptation to evil. Should you come to me my old propensity would return; to torment, to abuse the power placed in my hands is the irrevocable law of my nature, and I must obey it. 
                           "Poor child, remain with the good sisters; they will be kinder to you than I ever can; they are innocent, they are pure, and you will not be contaminated by coming in contact with guilt. 
                           "You cannot brighten me. I am but a blighted ruin around which no ivy may twine its clinging verdure. I can bestow a small endowment upon the convent, which will secure to you a respectable position among its inmates. Beyond that I cannot go, for my possessions are much overrated, and the bulk of my wealth must go to other claimants. It will be best for your earthly, as well as your heavenly welfare, for you to remain in your present secure and respectable asylum. Believe me, that weary as this lot seems to you, it is far preferable to the future you would embrace in coming to me; therefore I must lay upon you my positive command to remain in your convent. 
                           
                              ETIENNE LECOUR."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               A few lines were then rapidly dashed off in reply to the Superior. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MADAME:-Your letter has been received by me and perused with much surprise. I have been under the impression that the child of my deceased daughter was received as a proteg of your own, without reference to the pension it has been my will to pay you. That has been withdrawn at my command, for Adrienne has now reached an age which will enable her to be of use to you in the school under your supervision. She is now eighteen, and for two years past has been quite capable of earning her own living by assisting you; nay, I am well informed that such has been her employment, and yet you ask of me money to defray expenses she has more than paid by her services. 
                           "You ask from me authority to retain her with you, and plainly insinuate that such authority will be a guarantee that my fortune shall eventually be absorbed in the coffers of your convent. Madame, I will reveal to you a secret that may become important to you. My wealth is simply a life interest in a large landed estate which was the inheritance of my second wife, Madame Louis Mendon, ne Montreuil. Adrienne has no claim upon it: the law of Louisiana is rigid on that point, and there are claimants enough to dispute the succession if I should be so silly as to bequeath it to any relation of my own. 
                           "From my savings I may be able to afford a small endowment for Mademoiselle Durand, but it will only come to her at my decease. If you choose to do so, keep her with you; I disclaim all interest in her; or if you find her intractable, let her take her fate in her own hands. She has attained an age which will enable her to provide for herself. The child of Julien Durand will scarcely repay me for a different course toward her, for there is rebellion in her blood, and I do not care to have her near me as a memento of scenes I would gladly forget. 
                           "I repeat, Madame, that it is my earnest wish that this young girl shall remain with you. If possible, induce her to embrace the life of a religieuse. You were once gifted with eloquence; use it, Madame, wisely, gently, but firmly, and convince the wayward child with whom you have to deal that she must remain with you. 
                           "I live in a wretched, decaying mansion, which my neighbors have appropriately named Castle Dismal. I have two old half-demented servants as my attendants, and I receive no visitors. Judge, then, if a young girl could reside with me and be contented. 
                           "I use my brush to perpetuate the horrors I have witnessed, have borne a part in, and the ghastly evidences of my artistic talent form a gallery as unique as it would be frightful to the outside world, had they permission to behold it. But it is sacred to myself; not even the old negress who is my housekeeper, cook, and housemaid, has ever gained a glimpse of my treasures, though she avers that the room in which they are kept is haunted by evil demons, and she trembles to pass it alone in the twilight. 
                           "Pardon me, Madame; I grow garrulous with my pen, but my life is so lonely that I may allow myself the indulgence of writing freely to the only human being on earth around whom the golden memories of youth and love yet linger. Madame, does it not seem a mockery that I, a gray-haired, callous-hearted recluse, should refer to that romance enacted when we were both young and silly? You preferred a cloister to the fatal gift of my affections, and after events proved that you did well. I salute you, lady superior of a holy sisterhood, and ask the benefit of your prayers. 
                           
                              ETIENNE LECOUR."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               When he had finished his letters, M. Lecour arose and paced his room violently and noisily, as if to lose in motion the sense of wretchedness that oppressed him. He paused several times beside the table, and poured brandy from a bottle that stood upon it; this did not sufficiently soothe the nervous irritation from which he was suffering, and he took from the wall a Turkish pipe and filled the bowl with a drug, the use of which was then almost unknown in Europe-it had been sent to him from India by a brother, who was a physician there, with directions for its use. 
               Soon the smoke of the hatchis began to circle around the room, and the faint, sickening odor of the gum diffused itself through the atmosphere. The eyes of the smoker assumed a strange, wild glare, and the pupils dilated to an unusual size. Fantastic forms began to flit before his excited vision, which at first seemed clothed in light, but these soon gave place to others of a more fearful character. 
               M. Lecour continued to smoke on, in the hope that the increased influence of the drug would chase these away, and bring back the brighter visions. Suddenly his eyes fell upon a small clock, on the face of which was a calendar that unerringly pointed out the day of the month- 
               "The twentieth of January!" 
               The pipe dropped from his nerveless grasp, and his face became even more cadaverous than before. Striking his hand upon his brow, he almost shrieked: 
               "It is the anniversary of that fatal day when God's anointed fell beneath the hands of his cruel subjects. That awful shape may come again! How could I forget? Eady! Pierre! come back-come back, and watch beside me!" 
               His voice grew strained and harsh with fear, and he trembled before the unseen terror he believed was approaching him. Regicide, Jacobin, his hand was yet red with the Wood shed during that fatal era, and he knew that this night must prove one of terrible suffering to himself. 
               M. Lecour staggered up, and approached the door with the half-formed intention of flying through the darkness of the long corridors, till he reached the house occupied by the negroes; but his nervous trepidation was so great that he could not turn the key in the lock. 
               His senses deserted him, and he madly shrieked: 
               "Ha! I hear it! The demons are at their work already they have fastened me in that they have me at their mercy. Hark! I hear their steps flitting, flitting through the hall. 
               "Soon they will be here. 
               "There! there! they are beside me now! I see the shadowy procession of the dead whom I helped to send to the grave. Yes-they are bloody phantoms, carrying their heads upon their hands, and the writhing lips mock and gibber at me. Hark! What do they say? 
               "'Come with us; you marshalled us to the guillotine, come now and tramp with us our dance of death.' Yes-I must-I must go, when you command." 
               Lifting his hards, as if grasping those of an imaginary partner, M. Lecour commenced a wild gallopade through the large room, uttering himself a shrill whistle, to the music of which he continued his weird dance, till he fell utterly exhausted upon the floor. 
               The autumn wind had risen almost to a gale, and as it swept in gusts past the old tower, the branches of the trees without rattled sharply against the window panes. The dampness of the atmosphere caused the wood of which the furniture was made to snap with quick sharp reports, and each one sounded in the ears of the prostrate man as an ominous warning that the spirits of the dead were flitting through the room. The lights flickered in the draughts which forced themselves into the apartment, and he fancied that goblin shapes were hovering over them, making efforts to extinguish them, and leave him to the added horror of darkness. 
               The eyes of the prostrate old man wandered around the room, and fastened themselves with a sickening thrill of awe upon his easel. It stood in the full glare of light, and in his mad dance he must have swept aside the curtain that hung over it; but he now gazed upon it with the firm conviction that some viewless hand had removed the covering from his work. 
               The painting represented a woman not yet past middle age, with a face once regally handsome, but now worn and pallid, yet still lofty and unsubdued amid the evident squalor that surrounded her, for she sat in a narrow prison cell, and the delicate hands were endeavoring to mend a broken shoe with an old bodkin, and a thread drawn from the coarse garment which clothed her stately form. A mass of long, thick hair, white as a snowdrift, hung loosely over her shoulders, and the pale face looked out from it with a fixed expression of endurance, which revealed the indomitable soul within. 
               Around the slender throat was drawn a faint crimson line, so shadowy that it seemed a vapor of blood symbolizing the doom of the morrow, rather than the actual impress of the knife. It was, evidently the daughter of the Csars, the beautiful Marie Antoinette, the night before her execution, endeavoring to prepare her death toilet with some regard to external decency, even amid the ruthless mob that dragged her to the scaffold. 
               It was wonderfully life-like her, for the painter had seen her thus employed-he had stood as the last sentinel over that fallen majesty, and daguerreotyped her image so indelibly upon his brain as to be able to reproduce it with startling fidelity. 
               He had rode with her to the scaffold, stood beside the executioner when he lifted the gory head from the basket, and exhibited the features of her who had once been their queen, to the hootings and revilings of the pitiless mob. 
                
               No wonder this man was a monomaniac, for his were terrible memories to carry into the deep solitude in which he lived. Impelled by some impulse that he could not conquer, he had painted that head again and again, though the ineffably sad face was an inexpressible horror to him. 
               Now he fancied that the bowed head was lifted, the locked lips unclosed, and the cry: 
               "Where is my child?" seemed to issue from them. "Restore him to his own-now is your only chance to do so." 
               "The same message," he muttered-"always the same; this time with a slight addition. She knows yet what is passing on earth. Yes-if I dared I would make this atonement, but what could the poor imbecile do?" 
               By a violent effort he closed his eyes, and when he opened them again he saw that the head was in its usual position, and a gleam of judgment assured him that it was only his own fantasy which had produced the illusion. He laughed aloud, and to his excited senses the laugh seemed echoed from every angle of the room. Starting up to do battle with the unseen enemies who jeered at him thus, the old man staggered feebly from side to side, wildly striking in the empty space around him. 
               At length he fell exhausted upon the sofa which usually served him as a bed. His body rested there, but his spirit still wrestled with the weird shapes his own imagination evoked from the bloody record of the past. At length, unable to endure more, he drew from his pocket a small box, and took from it a portion of the dark green paste it contained. This soon produced a dull, benumbing sensation, and sleep, scarcely less terrible than his waking fancies, fell upon his senses. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER III. 
               AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL AT BELLAIR. 
               A VIOLENT rattling at his door aroused M. Lecour from his leaden slumbers, but the voice of old Eady reassured him, as he started up in affright. The broad glare of daylight was streaming into the apartment through the open shutters, and the pale flame of the candles looked feeble and sickly in contrast with it. 
               He glanced around the room, and hurriedly replacing the curtain over the picture of the unhappy queen, proceeded to open the door. 
               The negress stood without, with the breakfast tray lightly poised upon her head, and she peered curiously at her master while she arranged the table. She noted the disorder in which the room was left by his wild dance of the previous night, and with a degree of freedom which had become habitual to her, she bluntly said: 
               "Seems to me de debbil's bin to pay here las' night. What's gwine to come o' you, I'd like to know, ef you keeps on cuttin' up like mad, as you'm bin doin' o' late? I hearn you a stormin' an' goin' on even in my ole shanty, eber so fur off." 
               "Why didn't you come to me then, you old thunder cloud? I am sure I called you loud enough, if you had chosen to hear me." 
               The woman gave him a shrewd glance as she replied: 
               "I've come aforetime at your call, an' you knows what I got for dat 'terition. No-thank you, sir; old Eady's head aint gwine to poke itself where it'll be likely to get punched for nothin'. Is dese letters to go in de pos'-offis, sir? Pierre is uncommon willin' to take em', for he's cravin' another taste o' de stuff dat takes away de use o' de little brains de creeter have." 
               "Put the room in order, and take the letters to Pierre, with strict orders from me not to get drunk again, or I will punish him with a night in the picture-room. That threat will keep him sober, I think." 
               "Hi! I don' no' dat; caze you see, fool as he is, Pierre knows you aint a gwine to put him in thar. The fustest reason is, he'd die o' fright afore you'd git him in, an' de nex' is, you'm got too many o' yer own deviltries shet up in thar for you to be willin' to let him see 'em." 
               Put into a good humor by the succulent breakfast she had provided for him, M. Lecour only laughed at a liberty of speech which, in another mood, he might have punished; but the shrewd old woman knew when to utter her jests, and her master rather liked her for the independence of her replies. He only said: 
               "You had better not try my forbearance too far, or you may chance to get in there yourself, though you would be certain to blab everything you saw if you could only find a listener." 
               "An' a listener I shall soon have, I suppose, in dat fine young lady what's comin' here to live or to die mebbe, for it's my 'pinion dat de chances is even for one or t'other. I wishes to know what room I'm to fix for her, caze de goblins has tuck persession o' all de ole parts o' de house, an' you wouldn't like her to live in de lady's tower, I reckin." 
               A sickly pallor swept over the face of her master, and he hastily replied: 
               "I have changed my mind, Jackdaw, and your young mistress will not come to me. You need not trouble yourself about finding a room for her, for I have written to forbid her to leave France. Reflection convinced me that no young girl could exist a week in this old den, with such a companion as I should be for her." 
                
               "Bress de Lor! dat some sense have come back to you through ole Eady's argification. I'd be glad enuff to see anything young an' gay a-comin' in here to brighten us all up, ef I didn't know she'd pine herself to death. Ah, well, sir, I'll take de letters to my ole man, an' make him understand dat dey mus' go by de berry next chance." 
               Secretly rejoiced that her young mistress was not coming, Eady took the letters away, and a short time afterward Pierre, mounted on a small creole pony, issued from the tangled lawn that surrounded Castle Dismal, and trotted off upon his errand. The small trading house on the bank of the Mississippi to which letters were slowly transmitted from New Orleans, was dignified with the name of post-office by the negro, but it was in reality only a dpot for such goods as were necessary to the few planters in the vicinity. The date of our story goes back to the early part of the present century; when Napoleon was meditating the seizure of imperial authority, and but one year previous to the transfer of Louisiana to the government of the United States. At that day letters were long in reaching their destination, and those to which Pierre bore replies had been two months upon their way. 
               The road lay through wide fields cultivated in sugar and indigo, the last of which was destined to give place to cotton at no distant day. About a mile from the house, he passed a high-roofed Spanish building, surrounded by cottages, which formed the negro quarter to his master's estate; but Pierre knew better than to pause there, for he was not permitted to hold any intercourse with the other blacks. To prevent it the more effectually, M. Lecour had purchased himself, his wife and son from Virginia, while the hands upon the place were either Africans or natives of the colony, who spoke only a corrupt kind of French. Another recommendation of the old pair was that their child was dumb- he could not reveal the secrets of his prison-house, even if tempted to do so. But the poor lad did not live many years after his transfer to a new climate. 
               Pierre had proceeded about half the distance toward the landing, when he descried two persons on horseback approaching him. One was a tall, dark man, with regular features, and hair just beginning to be tinged with gray. His eyes were black, piercing, yet cold in their expression, revealing an unscrupulous nature, combined with fearlessness of consequences which would make him a formidable antagonist. He was mounted on a magnificent horse, of a deep chestnut color, which looked as fiery as his rider. 
               The companion of this traveller was a young girl, mounted upon a white horse, very handsomely caparisoned, that curvetted and bounded along as if conscious of the unusual loveliness of the burden it so daintily bore. A black travelling dress and a hood of the same color only served to enhance the delicate fairness of her complexion, now tinted with a roseate glow by the freshness of the winter air. Long curls of paly gold escaped from the confinement of the hood, and fell around a face which, lovely as it. unquestionably was, yet possessed as much character as that of her companion. Her brow was high and smooth, with dark, sweeping lashes shading large brown eyes, that had a clearness and depth of expression which gave a clue to the sweet yet firm spirit that beamed from them. Her mouth was beautifully curved, with lips of rose, and pearly teeth, yet that, with the softly rounded chin, revealed refinement of nature, combined with firmness, nay, obstinacy in the pursuance of that path which conscience told her was the right one for her to walk in. 
               She looked from side to side with an expression of eager interest, and listened with evident annoyance to her companion, who was saying: 
                
               "It is not yet too late to revoke your decision, Mademoiselle. I assure you, it will be impossible for you to live under the same roof with a madman, for such M. Lecour undoubtedly is. I will accompany you there, since you will have it so, and permit you to judge for yourself. After seeing this old recluse, you may be willing to avail yourself of the invitation of my stepmother to remain with her until you can settle on some plan for your future." 
               The girl sadly shook her head. 
               "No, no-I thank you from my heart for the kindness you have shown toward me, but I cannot accept Madame Crozat's invitation. My duty is to remain with this poor demented old man, if, as you assert, he is left to the mercy of his servants. I shall remain with him to cheer him, soothe him, and try to atone to him for the unhappiness my mother caused him." 
               "You do not know all you will have to contend with, Mademoiselle Adrienne. Wait till you arrive at Castle Dismal, and see if it will be possible for you to remain in so dreary a place as that to which you are bound. I own that I am selfish enough to wish that you may at once recoil from the aspect of the place, and from its maniac master." 
               "Pray-pray do not speak thus. Remember that I am his grand-daughter, that he is the only relative I have on earth. So I am doubly bound to him, for there is no other creature of my blood, and he is my sole dependence in this strange country." 
               "No, Adrienne," and the voice deepened and grew earnest. "M. Lecour is not your sole dependence, for you have won warm friends in my mother and myself, during our voyage up the river. When you need protection, appeal to us, and it shall not be in vain. That time may arrive sooner than you anticipate, for this old man will turn you from his doors the first time you are unfortunate enough to offend him, even if he will consent to receive you at all." 
                
               Adrienne confidently replied: 
               "I will not go at his command. By patience I will disarm his anger-I will soon make myself necessary to him." 
               "God forbid, child! that would be the heaviest tax of all, for M. Lecour would be insatiable in his demands upon your time, patience, and health. He would soon make you a martyr to his selfishness." 
               "Ah, M. Mendon, you are prejudiced against this unfortunate old man. You misjudge him, I trust. At all events, I must hope for the best, and not fail in my duty through faintness of heart. I am unlike other girls of my age, for I have known little of the pleasures of life, and, as you are already aware, I am now evading the rigid rule of a convent to seek protection and a home from M. Lecour." 
               "I am afraid, Mademoiselle, you will find that the exchange you have made has not improved your happiness; sombre as the life of a nun must be, you will find a residence at Castle Dismal far more difficult to endure." 
               Adrienne slightly reddened, and her voice had in it a tone of asperity, as she replied: 
               "It seems to me a shame that an old man, disgusted with society, who has sought the seclusion that is most congenial to him, should have his house banned by such a name being applied to it. Dreary enough, no doubt, his life is, but that should excite sympathy, not derision." 
               M. Mendon regarded her with a compassionate expression. He earnestly said: 
               "Few things are spoken of M. Lecour in derision, for people hold him in too deep-yet no, I will not tell you all, poor child! Keep your reverence for his gray hairs, your tenderness for his infirmities, as a shield between your own gentleness and his crabbed harshness. I will no longer call the old place Castle Dismal. It was once known as Bellair; it was then the grand residence of the country, but that was in the days of its builder, M. Montreuil, while his beautiful daughter was the greatest heiress in the colony." 
               "And Mademoiselle Montreuil-what of her fate, and how has my grandfather come into possession of her estate?" 
               M. Mendon looked surprised. 
               "Are you, then, ignorant of M. Lecour's history?" 
               "Profoundly so; I only know that he is the father of my mother, and that she offended him by marrying without his consent." 
               "Then I can tell you a little about him that will interest you. Mademoiselle Montreuil first married my elder brother; he was many years my senior, and I was but a lad when their union took place. I was very much attached to my new sister, and remained with her till after her second marriage. My brother lived but a few years, and in the same month M. Montreuil and Eugene died. For several years Louise lived in seclusion, but then she laid aside her mourning, and filled her house with company. 
               "One evening a stranger came to her door. He was a man over forty, of attractive exterior, and singular fascination of manner. In the old savage you are about to encounter, you will see few remains of this, but that he possessed strange power to charm was evinced by the fact that he soon won the regard of my sister, though she had many lovers far younger and better suited to her in every respect. 
               "M. Lecour brought letters of introduction from some friends in France, and one among them seemed to move Madame Mendon in a very singular manner. She wept over it till she was thrown into a violent paroxysm of hysterics, but her friends soon saw that the bearer of it had established over her an influence paramount to that of every other person. 
               "It ended, as you may anticipate, in her giving him her hand, against the advice of every friend she had. Their fears for her happiness were soon verified; M. Lecour severed her from all that had been dear to her, insisted that I should return to my own family, and soon refused admittance to her most intimate friends. I have every reason to believe that he forced her to commit suicide by a systematic course of ill-treatment. After her death he produced a document, properly executed, which enabled him to retain the estate bequeathed to his wife by her father." 
               The listener sighed heavily as she listened to this discouraging recital. She presently said: 
               "This old man cannot be God-forsaken, Monsieur, for am I not sent to him as a saving minister of grace? I feel in my heart that compassion for him, which I humbly trust will enable me to be of use to him in the unhappy condition to which he is reduced." 
               "Make the effort then, in God's name," replied M. Mendon, with an impatient movement, and an expression upon his features which betrayed how little he sympathized with the enthusiasm which led her to such a sacrifice of self. 
               "When you have satisfied yourself that his brutality is too great to be borne, come to my mother. Her heart and home will alike be open to you. I say nothing of myself, because from me you may be unwilling to accept an obligation, but I shall not the less be on the qui vive about everything that concerns your welfare." 
               "I thank you deeply, gratefully, and I will remember what you have just said, should the necessity which you anticipate arise. I regard it as an especial piece of good fortune that I chanced to meet yourself and your mother upon the boat. Without your kind care of me, I should indeed have been in a forlorn condition." 
               "And we, in our turn, are glad to have established a claim on you, Mademoiselle. In some sort you seem to belong long to us, as we were the first friends you made after landing in Louisiana. Ah, what have we here? Pierre, the servant of M. Lecour, as I live! The old man scarcely changes with the lapse of time, for he looks to me exactly as he did ten years ago." 
               Pierre also recognized M. Mendon, and checked his pony to offer him a salutation by taking off his ragged hat, and grinning from ear to ear. 
               "Hi, Marse Adolphe, de sight o' you is good for my eyes, sure 'nuff. I tole de ole 'oman dis was gwine to be a lucky day for me." 
               "You may well say that, Pierre," replied Mendon, with a smile, "for it brings to you an angel in the person of your young mistress." 
               The negro bowed lowly before the lovely girl, who smiled sweetly upon him, and said: 
               "I have come to live with my grandfather, Pierre, and see that he is properly taken care of in his old age." 
               At this announcement the whites of the old man's eyes became doubly conspicuous, and he repeated in an amazed manner: 
               "Live! You live at Castle Dismal! Oh Lor'! only ax Marse Adolphe ef dat can come to pass." 
               "You hear, Mademoiselle," said M. Mendon, significantly. "Even this untutored negro thinks it will be impossible for you to carry out your plan." 
               "I shall make the attempt, at all events," replied the young lady, decisively. "Since I have braved everything, and crossed the ocean to claim M. Lecour's protection, I will not shrink back when almost at his door." 
               Her cavalier bowed in silence, and again turning to the black, inquired: 
               "Whither are you bound this morning, Pierre?" 
               "To de landin' wi' some letters, an' I believe one on 'em is for dat berry young mistis, tellin' her dat my ole marster won't 'gree to have her wi' him on no terms whatsum-dever." 
               "Let me see them." 
               Pierre handed over the two letters for his inspection, and M. Mendon read aloud the address of each. 
               Adrienne held out her hand for her own, but the negro interfered, and respectfully said: 
               "'Scuse me, young mistis, but you see my marster is a rampageous sort o' man, an' ef I don't do what he tell'd me wi' dem letters, he mought hurt my feelin's, an' I'm uncommon tender 'bout 'em." 
               M. Mendon laughed as he said: 
               "Never mind about that, Pierre. I will explain to M. Lecour, and you shall be held blameless. Return with us to Bellair, and I will inform your master of the arrest of his postman on his route. It will now be useless to send the other letter." 
               "Is it Bellair ag'in, an you a-gwine to it? Oh, Lor! is de worl' a comin' to a eend dat dis should happen?" 
               "I hope not, old fellow; but fall behind and follow us, for I shall certainly call on M. Lecour this morning." 
               The three rode on in silence, for as they drew near the old mansion, each one had much to speculate on as to what would be the issue of the approaching interview. Adrienne threw her bridle over her arm, and broke the seal of her letter. She grew pale as she read the positive prohibition to her to leave the sanctuary in which she had been placed. M. Mendon watched her keenly, and his dark eyes flashed with exultation as they read the painful expression of indecision that swept over her features. He earnestly said: 
               "It is as I supposed, Mademoiselle. M. Lecour will not consent to receive you. Why humiliate yourself by asking shelter of him at all? Return with me to the protection of my mother at once." 
                
               Adrienne slowly folded her letter, and placed it in the pocket of her dress. She at length said: 
               "Since I am so near my grandfather, I must first see him, and then decide if it will be necessary for me to accept your offer. Since I have abandoned the asylum in which he thought me safe when this letter was written, I think it is only right to appeal to him for protection before accepting that of any other person. He is my natural guardian, and I trust he will not refuse shelter to his only descendant. At all events I can but try." 
               M. Mendon silently acquiesced in her decision, though it filled him with vexation, and they rapidly rode on till they left the open country, and entered the thick woodland matted together with clinging vines into an almost impervious jungle. A narrow pathway wound through this, which only permitted a single horseman to advance upon it. 
               M. Mendon took the lead, followed by Adrienne, and when the sombre shadows fell over her, she experienced a shrinking oppression at her heart, which was a premonition of all she was to suffer in the dreary abode toward which she so courageously pursued her way. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               AN UNGRACIOUS RECEPTION. 
               THE party wound slowly forward for many moments before an opening appeared. At length they reached a neglected hedge which surrounded a wide lawn now choked with weeds and undergrowth, that had encroached upon the ground even to the doorstep. A carriage sweep covered with gravel was the only portion free in a measure from dank weeds, and in the circle it enclosed stood a broken fountain, the waters of which had once flowed through a cluster of marble water-lilies. Now it was dry, the flowers broken and falling, and the place left to desolation. The few shrubs that survived such neglect bloomed unheeded, and only seemed to add to the dreariness of the impression produced by the whole scene. 
               M. Mendon and his companion reached the front of the building and dismounted. On looking around for Pierre they found that he had disappeared; in fact, he had struck off into a side-path leading to the quarters of Eady, to warn her of the unexpected arrival of strangers. 
               The floor of the front gallery was covered with dead autumn leaves, and the huge iron knocker was so stiff from disuse, that it was with much effort at length forced to perform its legitimate service. The sound reverberated through the solitary house like a sudden clap of thunder. No answer came, and again the loud summons awakened the echoes around. The front window in M. Lecour's tower was thrown violently open, his head was thrust over the railing of the balcony which was in front of it, and his angry voice asked: 
               "What fool is battering my door down? Is it not yet understood that I admit no strangers into my house? Go away, and cease that noise, or I will let loose my bloodhound upon you!" 
               M. Mendon was about to reply, and explain the cause of their appearance, when the door suddenly unclosed, and Eady in her bright calico dress, and scarlet turban, stood before them. She seemed in a most perturbed state of mind, and before M. Mendon could address her she exclaimed: 
               "Marse Adolphe, I mus' open de door when you knocks, let de consequins be what dey may. Oh, you is welcome here, to de ole 'oman, at least!" 
               "I believe it, Eady, and I am glad to see your good-natured tured face again. I have set my foot in this house once more, to bring to its shelter the child of its present owner. Mademoiselle Durand intends to take up her abode at Bellair, if she finds it possible to remain here." 
               Adrienne held out her hand to the old woman; she took it, peered wistfully into her face, and gravely shaking her head, led the way into the lower room of the eastern tower. She requested them to be seated, while she went up to her master, and explained the cause of the intrusion. 
               Adrienne glanced around the apartment with deep interest. It had evidently been adorned by a woman of refined taste and genial culture, with wealth at her command. The faded walls were painted in frescoes, representing the history of Hector and Andromache. The floor was inlaid in a mosaic made of the dark and light woods furnished by the Southern forest, and statues stood in the angles of the wall, for like the other tower, it was an octagon. Faded curtains of blue brocade draped the windows, and carved furniture of the Louis Quatorze style, with cushions of the same material upon the sofa and chairs, filled the apartment. 
               A small inlaid table sustained the favorite volumes of her who had once been the presiding spirit of that forsaken spot, and beside them stood a vase filled with faded flowers, placed there years before, and left to wither in solitude, for the old negress, who dusted the furniture occasionally, had left them with a kind of superstitious reverence for the mistress whose hands had placed them there in her presence a few hours before the last act in the sad tragedy which those walls had witnessed. What followed, Eady shuddered to remember, and she never entered that room without devoutly crossing herself, and glancing around, as if the scene enacted there sprang up before her in all its vivid reality of horror. She guarded her secret faithfully, and only to herself, and the maniac up stairs, was known the origin of a dark stain upon the floor, which looked as if coffee had been spilled upon it. Once it gleamed with a brighter hue, but, as I have said, the secret was well kept. 
               With a painful contraction of the heart, M. Mendon walked around the apartment, for he had sincerely loved the charming woman who had watched over a portion of his boyhood, and the last time he stood in that room she had clasped him to her heart, and wept tears of bitter anguish over their enforced separation. 
               A vailed picture hung above the parting of Hector and Andromache, and with almost reverential awe he lifted the curtain, and said in suppressed tones: 
               "Look up, Mademoiselle, and behold the sweet face I have told you your own so strikingly resembles." 
               Adrienne beheld a fair woman, with blonde hair hanging in long curls nearly to her waist; a rosy mouth of almost infantile sweetness of expression, and large, dark, sorrowful eyes. 
               "Ah, Madame Lecour is far lovelier than I am," exclaimed the young girl, and she gazed with rapt expression upon those eyes which seemed to beam upon her with tender regard. An indefinable sympathy seemed to link her to the original of that picture, and tears started in her own eyes as she gazed upon it. 
               M. Mendon glanced from one to the other, and said: 
               "To me the living face is more interesting than the pictured one, for it has energy and power, which my unfortunate sister lacked. But you are wonderfully like her, Mademoiselle, and that resemblance will probably be an additional bar to your remaining here." 
               She turned toward him with an expression of surprise, but the answer trembling upon her lips was arrested by the appearance in the doorway of the bizarre figure of M. Lecour. He wore an old brocade dressing-gown, faded and worn nearly threadbare, and his long hair and beard, white as a snow-drift, contrasted strangely with the vivid passion that blazed in his eyes, convulsed his mobile lips, and blanched his aged cheeks to the pallor of death. 
               Adrienne involuntarily shrunk back, and sought to shelter herself behind the tall form of her companion. The irate old man advanced into the room, confronted M. Mendon, and said, in deep, stern tones: 
               "You here, Adolphe Mendon! I thought that you long since understood that my roof affords no shelter to you or yours." 
               "I understand that perfectly, M. Lecour; but as I have brought to you your own child, I think I may be pardoned for the intrusion. My visit shall be brief enough to satisfy you." 
               "And is it not enough to come unbidden into the house which has so long been closed on you, but you must violate the sanctity of that curtain which no sacrilegious hand has lifted for years. Who is this girl? What do you mean by my child? I have no child; and this stranger does not look as if she belonged to my race." 
               "Yet this is Mademoiselle Durand-I should have said your grandchild, Monsieur. This young lady has crossed the ocean with the purpose of sharing the solitude in which you live." 
               At this announcement M. Lecour advanced to the agitated Adrienne, and harshly asked: 
               "Why did you not wait for my reply to your letter before you came on such an errand as this? I shall send you back to your convent as an escaped nun, and I do not care if they put you in prison, and feed you on bread and water, for your disobedience to my wishes." 
               "Stop, Monsieur," said Mendon, with dignity. "I am here as Mademoiselle's Durand's protector, and in my presence ence you shall not threaten her in your usual brutal manner. If you refuse to receive her, she can find an asylum with my step-mother, who already knows and appreciates her." 
               M. Lecour glanced from one to the other, and then sulkily said: 
               "Get along with you then. Take her away as soon as may be, for if you are to have any claims on her, I will have nothing to say to her." 
               Hitherto Adrienne had stood in the shadow of M. Mendon's stalwart figure, but she now stepped forward, with clasped hands and tearful eyes, and imploringly said: 
               "Oh! mon pre, after all my efforts to reach you, is this the reception you give me? Let me remain with you, I entreat; let me become the minister of peace and hope to you. Alas! is your heart closed to the claims of your daughter's child?" 
               His gaze fell upon her upturned face: he started, staggered back, and lifted his hand in a deprecating manner as he faltered: 
               "You-you the child of Estelle Lecour! Her hair was dark as the raven's wing, and her eyes black as the sloe. No, no, no! It cannot be-it cannot be!" 
               "Yet my father was fair, I have been told. Yes, M. Lecour, I am the child of your daughter, and I claim a home beneath your roof. I have fled from my convent-I will die sooner than return to it. Let me remain with you, I entreat, for I am a stranger in a strange land, with no claim on any one save you. If I prove a burden to you, I promise in the future to seek the means of making my own support. Now, I only ask for protection; if I can render myself necessary to your happiness, you will then permit me to remain beside you." 
               "Happiness!" he repeated, with scornful bitterness. "I do not know what the word means; but since you are so confident of teaching me that such a thing exists, you may remain and try the experiment. Since I find that M. Mendon and his mother are anxious to take you off my hands, I believe that I will disappoint them by keeping you myself." 
               Ungracious as this permission was, Adrienne received it with an expression of joy which caused M. Mendon to frown and bite his lip with vexation. She gracefully offered him her hand, and looked appealingly in his face, as she said: 
               "Pardon me, if I stay with even such a reception as this My duty is here; this is truly my home; but I will soon see you again. When M. Lecour learns how kind you and your good mother have been to me, he will not prohibit our meeting again." 
               M. Lecour harshly broke in: 
               "But I do most positively prohibit it; and M. Adolphe knows better than to thwart me. You part here; if you remain with me, it must be on my own terms." 
               M. Mendon whispered: 
               "Leave him to his madness, Mademoiselle, and come where happiness courts your acceptance. You will die of ennui here, even if that old ogre does not break your heart." 
               She flushed deeply-an expression of reserve swept over her fair face, and she decidedly said: 
               "It is a happiness I cannot accept, Monsieur. Place no hopes on me, for they can only meet with disappointment. My gratitude is yours for the kindness received, but my duty is here. I accept my grandfather's terms." 
               He muttered some unintelligible words, bowed low, and turned to depart. He had reached the door when a new impulse seemed to move him, and he turned his face, stern, dark, and fixed, toward her; he held out his hand, and said: 
                
               "If you should need me, command my services. Remember that I am always your fast friend." 
               Before she could thank him, M. Mendon was gone, and the strong heart which had courageously borne up against all the vicissitudes of her long voyage seemed to faint within her as the sound of his horse's hoofs died away in the distance; and when she caught the cold gleam of M. Lecour's eyes fixed steadily upon her features, she sunk into a chair and burst in tears. 
               With more consideration than might have been expected of him, the old man remained silent till this burst of emotion had exhausted itself. He motioned to Eady to leave the room, and quietly awaited Adrienne's own time to speak. 
               Making a violent effort for self-control, she looked up, wiped away the tears from her eyes, and faltered: 
               "Pardon me, mon pre, but I have borne so much to get here, that I am quite overcome by the recollection of all I have passed through." 
               "Hem! well-yes, it was a long journey for a young girl to undertake, and you must have a spirit of your own to carry it through as you have done. Tell me all about it; how did you evade the holy sisterhood among whom you have been educated? I really like your enterprise and courage." 
               Reassured by the change in his tone, Adrienne half smiled as she commenced her narrative. 
               "The Lady Superior has doubtless informed you that I occasionally visited one of ray classmates. A few days after her last letter was despatched to you, a pressing request came that I should be permitted to act as the attendant of Mademoiselle Le Grand, on the occasion of her approaching marriage. My protectress very unwillingly consented, but as the bride was the niece of a high dignitary in the church, and the daughter of an officer distinguished among the friends of the first consul, she could not very well refuse. 
               "From my childhood the Abbess had looked on me as one destined to the cloister, and these glimpses of brilliant worldly life, she feared, might influence my mind against the vocation chosen for me. But that was not needed, for I disliked the thought of spending my life in a convent, and when I set out to join the bridal party, it was with the resolution strong in my heart never to return to it." 
               She paused, as if uncertain how to proceed, and M. Lecour significantly said: 
               "Go on, Mademoiselle. Speak the whole truth, I am aware of the lover already." 
               She blushed vividly, as she proceeded: 
               "I played my part at the wedding. I had often before met with the cousin of my friend, but Victor Duvernay until now had never ventured to speak of love. Emilia told him of my resolution to claim my freedom, and he offered himself to me as my protector through life." 
               "And why did you not marry this lover, and save us both from the ordeal we are about to undergo?" 
               The young girl changed color at this, but she gravely went on: 
               "I might have done so, had circumstances been favorable to our union; but M. Duvernay objected to a portionless daughter-in-law. My claims to an inheritance were so uncertain that no reliance could be placed on them, and he advised me to return to the sisterhood, and endeavor to forget my initiation into worldly pleasures and worldly cares. His son refused to give me up, and the father, exasperated at the opposition to his wishes, threatened to inform the bishop of what was passing. That would have been fatal to our hope of a future union, for I knew that I should be restored to my convent, to be kept tinder strict watch, till your decision as to my future fate should arrive. 
                
               "I knew beforehand what that decision would probably be, for the Superior had always assured me that there could be no doubt of your intention to devote me to a religious life. My lover was dependent upon his father; and I knew that we could not be united, and no resource was open to me but to come to you. Emilia kindly assisted me with money, her husband secretly made arrangements with a merchant who was about to emigrate from Havre to New Orleans with his family, to receive me under his protection. He merely stated to M. Nicot that I was a young lady educated in France, who was anxious to return to her family in Louisiana. Madame Nicot was as kind to me as a mother could have been, and we had a prosperous voyage to New Orleans. 
               "From there I feared to write, lest you might resent my contumacy, and prohibit me from coming to you. I lost no time in setting out for your home, as my friends luckily found a keel boat about to ascend the river. I was placed under the care of the captain, but among the passengers I found M. Adolphe Mendon and his mother, who kindly interested themselves about me; and on learning who I was, took me under their charge. I found that they were from the same parish, were near connections of yours, and gradually I unfolded to them my history. During our tedious trip, they were very kind to me, and if I would have listened to them, they would have taken me home with them; but I thought it best to come to you first." 
               "And it is well you did," said M. Lecour, vindictively. "If your foot had pressed their threshold first, it should never have crossed mine. Those people are my deadly and detested enemies, and they had some sinister object in view, or they would not have sought to gain influence over you. But what became of the craven lover who permitted you to be snatched from him in such a manner? Separated so far from you, he can scarcely hope for a reunion on this side of eternity. Methinks he is but a laggard in love, after all." 
               The young girl blushed vividly, and eagerly replied: 
               "No, Monsieur, you wrong him. I concealed from Victor that I was about to embark for Louisiana. When M. Duvernay appealed to me, and showed me the ruin I would bring upon his son if I gave him my dowerless hand, I resolved to withdraw from Paris without the knowledge of my lover. The arrangements for my evasion were of course conducted with the greatest secresy, and Emilia and her husband came with me to Havre under the pretext of making a brief bridal tour." 
               "It is well for them that the good old days of papal supremacy, and lettres de cachet, have passed away, or they might not fare so well after assisting a young person almost in her novitiate to run away from her convent. It was wrong in the Superior to permit you to visit your friend; the walls of the cloister should have bounded your earthly vision. Oh, child! I wish you were safe back among the good sisters, for I am afraid you have made a sad change in coming to me." 
               Though his tone was harsh, his words seemed to imply some sympathy for the future that lay before her, and Adrienne took his hand in her own, and looked tenderly in in his eyes as she replied: 
               "Can you not find room in your heart, mon pre, for your poor daughter's child? Ah! I need to be loved-to love something, and that is why the cold formal life of the convent was so oppressive to me. Let me cling to you; give me only kind words, and looks, and I will be your slave. Alas! I am wilfulf, but I am not strong. I am unable to stand alone." 
               M. Lecour smiled grimly at this appeal. 
               "One would scarcely think so after your recent escapade. I believe you must have some of my blood in you, though your looks seem to belie it. Girl, do you know that if you had come to me alone, wearing the resemblance to one in her grave, which I can so plainly see, I should have ordered you from my door? But that accursed Mendon came with you-I read his face, and I saw that love for your fair looks already glows in his heart. I was resolute that he should not wrest you from me, although you came to me an unwelcome and unbidden guest. I do not chose to act a part toward you. Mademoiselle. I tolerate your presence only; you must prove your right to a better position in my house by endurance, patience and forbearance. You will find ample scope for all three, unless I am greatly mistaken." 
               Adrienne felt chilled by his words and manner, but she endeavored to conceal it from the keen eyes that rested upon her varying features, and softly said: 
               "I accept your terms, mon pre; till I can gain a place in your heart for myself, let it be closed to me. Ah! I can surely bring a ray of sunshine into this lonely abode: I shall not be denied the power to brighten a life which love has so long forsaken." 
               "Love!" he repeated with a bitter sneer. "It is a dream-a delusion of youth: it survives not the first storm, as your own experience should already have shown you; for Victor Duvernay will soon find another to console him for your loss. You fancy that in the absence of all other love, you will be able to attach yourself to a ruin like me. Child, does the ivy cling to the tree scathed by lightning? Do you find flowers on the fiery brink of Etna? As well may you hope to call down an angel from heaven, as to bring back hope or gladness to my seared soul. No-no-I am a miserable wreck, and you would have done well to accept the love M. Mendon was ready to offer you, if you had been lured to the home of his stepmother." 
                
               "Ah! that was impossible while I love another," said Adrienne, who had listened to this passionate outburst with yearning compassion which she dared not express to the cynical old man. "Years may intervene before Victor can claim me as his own, but I feel in my heart that the time will surely come." 
               A bitter sneer crossed the face of the listener, and he said in his hardest manner: 
               "I wish you to understand two things, Mademoiselle. The first is, that I shall have no fortune to bestow upon you; a bare maintenance is all you will ever get from me. The second is, that you shall not attempt to hold any intercourse with M. Mendon or his family. They have traduced and injured me-they would have wrested my wife's fortune from me, if they could have accomplished it; but I baffled them-ha! ha! I baffled them, as I always have baffled my enemies." 
               He arose and walked up and down the floor with an expression of exultation upon his features. Suddenly his eyes fell upon the vailed picture, and a singular change came over him-he staggered-gasped for breath, and said in a stifled tone: 
               "Let us leave this room; its atmosphere oppresses-it is rarely opened, for I live in my own den up stairs. Come with me; the dinner hour approaches, and Eady will serve it in my room." 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               ADRIENNE IN THE TIGER'S LAIR. 
               ADRIENNE thus commanded, arose to accompany M. Lecour. A valise, containing all her wordly possessions lay upon a chair; she would have removed it, but he said: "Leave it till Eady has prepared a room for you. By the way, I trust you are not afraid of ghosts." 
               At this abrupt inquiry the young girl grew slightly pale, though she laughed as she replied: 
               "This old, half-ruinous house must, of course, have a ghost story attached to it; but I believe I have as little superstition as one of my years and education may be supposed to possess." 
               "Humph! that is not saying much, after all, for your courage. I have no doubt you are quite as superstitious as all the rest of the strong-minded people, who refuse to acknowledge it. I tell you it is born in us all, and is to me the strongest proof that there is a hereafter. If I could get rid of my superstition, I should be a thorough follower of Voltaire." 
               Adrienne regarded him with dilating eyes, and he went on in the same sardonic tone: 
               "Let me advise you to one thing, Mademoiselle, steel your heart and mind against a belief in what you cannot account for. This caution seems necessary, for a great many things happen in this old house, which, to say the least, are very singular." 
               He watched her face as he said this, marked the thrill of terror that swept through her frame, and a wild laugh rang out in the empty hall through which they were passing. 
               "Ha! ha! I see how strong you are! We must not put you in the old pile, as I at first intended. Do you think you could summon enough courage to pass a night alone in the echoing rooms in the centre building? They have been given up to the rats since my lady wife died, but they have fine furniture in them, and we might get a few cats to clear the vermin away." 
               Adrienne commanded her voice sufficiently to reply in steady tones: 
                
               "Pray, do not put me far from you, mon pre; I have never slept in a room alone, and I am afraid that in a desolate house like this, I should suffer much from idle fancies." 
               He fastened his cold gleaming eyes upon her with an expression of such singular meaning, that a feeling of fear began to creep into her heart. Was he mad, after all? If so, what was to become of her? She began already to comprehend all the desolation of the position in which she had placed herself.-Its danger was to come as a revelation to her when it was too late to retrace her steps-but let us not anticipate. 
               Already she began to feel that M. Mendon's offer of future assistance was not unnecessary. Ah! why could she not have won his friendship, and not his love; then she might have claimed an asylum with his stepmother if she found it impossible to live beneath the same roof with this unknown relative. 
               The education of Adrienne had predisposed her mind to superstitious fears. In addition to this, the young stranger was endowed with a most impressible organization, and a depth of intuitive power, which almost trenched on clairvoyance. 
               A chill as of death swept over her, as she followed M. Lecour up the winding staircase, and she felt that to suffer intensely, in this long-sought shelter, was her lot; perhaps to become a victim to the wild vagaries of the unscrupulous man who walked before her with rapid steps toward his own sanctum. 
               Adrienne glanced nervously around the apartment and felt partially reassured by its orderly appearance, for Eady had arranged it, and set the table for two persons while her master was engaged with his guest. A bright smile flashed over her face as she saw the bookcase, and she was soon engaged in looking over its contents. History, light literature, and biography, were well represented on its shelves, and with sparkling eyes, she said: 
               "Mon pre, there is some sympathy in our tastes, at least, for I find here books I have long desired to read, and they look as if you too have often consulted their pages." 
               "Books and my pencil are my only resources now. The solitude in which it is my pleasure to live, afford me no others." 
               "But I will bring a brighter day to you, Monsieur. Permit me to become your reader, for your eyes must suffer from such constant use as your two employments demand." 
               He glared suspiciously on her at this proposal, and abruptly said: 
               "Perhaps you have come hither to be a spy upon me. Why should you ask so onerous a position as that of reader to me, unless it is to watch me in every phase of my mind? to surprise from me my hoarded life memories in some unguarded moment." 
               "I do not understand you," she replied, in affright, for his face assumed an expression that chilled her to the heart. "Ah, mon pre do not suspect, I entreat you, that in me you have received a traitor beneath your roof." 
               "If I thought so, I would immolate you as you stand before me. 'There is a skeleton in every house,' says the adage. This one is no exception to it; but I warn you that it will be fatal to you to discover it. You have forced yourself upon me, and I agree to give you shelter, sustenance and clothing, on the condition that you shall be true to me. That you do not seek to peer into my affairs, nor reveal to mortal being what may be voluntarily made known to you. Swear fidelity to me on this cross." 
               He snatched up a wooden cross, and held it toward her. His excited manner, flaming eyes, and raised voice, confirmed firmed her first fear that he was unsound in mind; and with pale lips she uttered the oath demanded of her. He triumphantly said: 
               "On your head shall fall the punishment due to the crime, if you break your vow." 
               At that moment Eady entered, bearing the waiter which contained the dinner, and proceeded to arrange it upon the table, on one corner of which she had spread a white napkin. With her appearance, the mood of M. Lecour seemed to change quite suddenly. He rapidly replaced the cross in the niche from which he had taken it, and eagerly inspected the viands as they were placed before him. 
               "Hem! chicken forever; am I never to have any other meat than chicken for my dinner? Potatoes mashed-potatoes in the skin-and potatoes fried! Your potato crop must be extensive this year, Jackdaw, for of late you give me no other vegetable." 
               "You must 'scuse all aperient shortcomings, marster, an' young mistis, caze do drowt is impowerin' an' have dried up de gardin my ole man made. I does de bes' I kin, an' de chickens is riz by myself." 
               With a profound courtesy, Eady placed a bottle of red wine beside her master's plate, and invited the newcomer to be seated. This politeness was necessary on her part, for M. Lecour, apparently oblivous of the presence of the stranger, sat down at once, and commenced carving the chicken. 
               Adrienne seated herself opposite to him, and he acknowledged her presence by placing the wing and a small portion of the breast upon her plate; the remainder he transferred to his own, and ate it with an apparent gusto that did not betray any distaste to it, in spite of his expressed discontent with what had been provided. 
               He pushed the potatoes contemptuously away from him when they were offered, and only varied his repast by enormous slices of bread and liberal libations from his wine bottle. He did not offer any of this to Adrienne, and said, by way of apology: 
               "Your education has not accustomed you to drink wine, therefore I do not offer it to you." 
               Yet the poor girl would have very thankfully accepted a small portion, for she felt faint and unnerved by the new and discouraging position in which she found herself placed; and with much difficulty did she swallow a few morsels of the food set before her. 
               Eady hospitably pressed her to eat, but her grandfather seemed scarcely to notice her presence while absorbed in the satisfaction of his appetite. When he had demolished the last morsel of the chicken, and drank the whole bottle of wine, he inquired of the negress: 
               "Where will you put your young lady, Eady?" 
               "Dat am for you to say, Monsieur, caze I don't know a room in dis house dat is fit for sich as she to stay in." 
               "Sich as she!" repeated her master, mockingly. "What is there remarkable about her, pray? A pale-faced, yellow-haired girl, who has a will of her own, as she has sufficiently proved, and yet is afraid of such impalpable things as ghosts. Ha! ha! how do you think she will get along here, Jackdaw?" 
               "She'll do berry well, Monsieur, ef you'll let me put her in de lady's tower. Fact is, dat's de only place she can go in, case de big house is done gin up to de rats an' mice, an' dey cuts up sich antics dat I'd often b'lieve dat the infannet rigions had emptied darselves in 'em, ef I didn't know better." 
               Adrienne found some comfort in the strong emphasis Eady placed upon the last words, and concluded in her own mind that if an ignorant old negress had abjured all superstitious fears, she might surely find strength to cast them aside. 
               At the suggestion of the lady's tower, the face of M. Lecour darkened, and he seemed on the point of bursting forth in a furious tirade, but the old woman looked unflinchingly, perhaps warningly, at him. Her eyes seemed to possess some magnetic power to quell his violence, and he muttered: 
               "Well, well, after all, why should I care? Everything is safe enough there, and the place has no sanctity to me. Let it be so, in God's name." 
               Turning to Adrienne, he remarked, by way of explanation: 
               "The tower opposite to this was once occupied by Madame Lecour-the upper apartment was her bed-chamber, and the lower one her sitting-room. Since you will remain here, you can take possession of them as your own. You may do as you please in them, provided you do not interfere with me. You will often hear me cry out, but you must not mind that; I warn you that it will be dangerous for you to come near me at such times, for I tolerate intrusion from no one." 
               The young stranger bent her head, and drearily said: 
               "I will obey you, mon pre. I hope in time that you will learn to trust me, will give me your confidence, so far as to enable me to be of use to you during your hours of suffering. I believed I might be of service to you, or I should not have thrust my unwelcome presence upon you." 
               "Child, don't be a fool, and don't try to play the sentimental with me; I have no taste for it. You are here now, you have no other resource except to stay with me, or throw yourself upon the charity of strangers, for the Mendons are only connections of yours through me, and I hate-I loathe them. The bare suspicion that you might prefer their home to mine, dreary as it is, would cause me to hurl my bitterest malediction against you. There! there! you need not cry, for tears do not move me. I have passed that ordeal long ago. Go with Eady, inspect your domains, and make up your mind to live as contentedly as you can within them. Jackdaw will supply your wants. Look to her and Pierre, and make them get what is necessary for you." 
               Thus dismissed, Adrienne wiped away the starting tears which had so irritated him. She ventured to approach him, and putting forth her slender hand, said, in a pleading tone: 
               "Will you not permit me to become your daily companion? Alas! that was my hope in coming hither." 
               "Child, we can never soften the iron which has once been molten and hardened again; it will break, but not bend. Such is my nature. I can suffice unto myself, and it is my intention to do so to the last. It is a pity that you would come hither to be crushed by my waywardness and indifference, but I cannot change. Since you have risked so much, you must bear the consequences. To one of your temper, perhaps even this will be better than imprisonment within your convent walls." 
               "Oh, far, far better! I am ungrateful to be downcast. Here I can at least have the open air, God's sunshine, and freedom to move within my narrow sphere as I please. Good day, Monsieur, I will remember your restrictions, and endeavor to find such employment as will enable me to bear the solitude to which it is your pleasure to banish me." 
               "Here are books," he abruptly rejoined. "They are the products of the best minds-you can take such as you like from day to day when I permit you to come to me." 
               She thanked him, and turned to leave the apartment. As she passed near the easel, her eyes fell upon the portrait, and she stretched out her hand as if to lift the curtain, as she asked: 
                
               "May I look upon your work, mon pre?" 
               With a furious cry, he bounded forward, dashed aside the uplifted hand, and stood panting with sudden rage before the frightened girl. 
               "This-this is banned-remember, banned to you till I choose to remove the prohibition. No profane eye rests upon my work. Never, as you value the home I have given you, do you offer to look on any painting I may be engaged on, unless I permit you expressly to do so. There, you understand me-go now; I wish to be alone; I must be left to solitude." 
               Adrienne felt the touch of Eady's hand upon her arm, and, bewildered by the strange scene in which she had borne a part, she mechanically followed her from the room. 
               When the door closed upon them, the old woman said, in an apologetic tone: 
               "Yer mus' 'scuse de marster, young mistis; he's had a deal o' trouble in his day, an' I b'lieve he don't allers know 'zactly what he's sayin'. You'll soon git used to him, tho', and larn how to humor his tantrums. It's de only way to git along wi' sich a rampageous man." 
               It seems necessary to explain here that during the childhood of Adrienne, the sisterhood among whom she had been educated took refuge in England from the religious persecutions that took place in France during the Reign of Terror. Several years spent there gave her as accurate a knowledge of the English language as of her own, and she was thus enabled to understand the broad pronunciation of Eady perfectly well. 
               M. Lecour stood looking after the receding form of the young stranger, and a mingled expression of uncertainty fear, and wrath, swept over his features. He muttered: 
               "What does this likeness mean? It is wonderful-it is fearful. The very step is her's, the tone of the voice the same, yet this girl comes to me as the child of my daughter. Is there a conspiracy to rob me of my wealth, and is this girl sent hither to make good her claim to the inheritance as my descendant, when in reality she is of another race? Could such a fraud be practised against me? Let me see-let me recall facts in the long buried past." 
               He bowed his head, ransacked the hidden chambers of memory, and a heavy scowl settled upon his brow. At length he spoke through his closed teeth. 
               "If it is so, better had she trusted herself in the den of a hungry lion, than have trusted to my mercy. Mendon saw this resemblance too, and he wished to lure her to his mother's house, that the heiress might be secured. I foiled him there. I kept her, that I might make sure if my suspicions are correct. Should they prove so, what then?" 
               A cruel, vindictive gleam shot from his eyes, and his slender fingers seemed to close over an airy weapon; but he spoke no more. 
               Presently M. Lecour seized a pen, and dashed off another letter to the Lady Superior. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MADAME:-After all my cautions, all my anxiety to give my grand-daughter to the cloister, you have permitted her to evade you, and escape from France. She is here; I have seen and talked with her; but from that interview a strange doubt has arisen in my mind. Is the girl who calls herself Adrienne Durand really entitled to bear that name? Is she an imposter, or is she the child I caused to be intrusted to your charge? 
                           "It is a serious inquiry, Madame, and I warn you that it will be dangerous to attempt to carry on a conspiracy against me. I am aware that my second wife was educated in your house, and that a strong attachment existed between her and yourself. That attachment may have led you to attempt an imposition which, if detected, may lead to results you never contemplated as possible. If such is the position of affairs, Madame, recall my past history, and tremble. 
                           "The Secretary of Egalit, the friend and co-worker of Danton, the secret counsellor of Robespierre, have I not waded in a sea of blood, and do you imagine that a single feeble life shall be permitted to stand between me and the wealth I have long considered as my own? 
                           "I know the early history of Louise Montreuil; this young girl is wonderfully like her, and should she prove-you understand me, Madame, sufficiently for my purpose. The fate of this rash creature is now absolutely in my power, and what use I may make of that power remains for you to decide. If you cannot positively assure me beyond a doubt that this is really my daughter's child, I cannot answer for the result. Write to me without a moment's delay, and unravel to me the singular mystery which gives me a descendant who is the living image of the deceased Madame Lecour, when there is no acknowledged child of her's in existence. 
                           "I am convinced that you can throw the light on this subject that is necessary to its full comprehension, and I impatiently await your reply. 
                           
                              "ETIENNE LECOUR."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               THE TOWER ROOMS, AND WHAT WAS FOUND IN THEM. 
               ADRIENNE followed Eady across a wide gallery, and paused before the door of a lady's tower, while the negress selected a key from the large bunch she carried in her pocket. She thrust it into the disused lock with a harsh, grating sound, and after several efforts succeeded in turning it. 
               The door at length unclosed, and they stepped into an apartment three sides of which were octagonal, while the fourth one was filled up by a large armoire built against the wall, and an alcove in a line with it filled up by a bed. The furniture was of the same style as that in the lower room, covered with faded damask, though here it had once been rose-colored. 
               The alcove was draped with lace curtains, and above them was a cornice of carved work representing a basket of flowers upheld by a pair of dimpled Loves which seemed to float above, sustained by their expanded wings. A large mirror, extending from the floor to the ceiling, occupied the space between two of the windows, and opposite to this was placed a dressing-stand, with an oval glass which enabled the occupant of the room to view her whole figure when in full toilette. 
               A few pictures were upon the walls, mostly representing mountain scenery, which had probably been preferred from the contrast they afforded to the flat country in which Madame Lecour had passed the latter portion of her life. A small carpet, an article of great luxury at that time in the colony, lay in front of the small fire-place; it had been woven in France, in imitation of Gobelin tapestry, and the arabesque pattern, in which the most gorgeous colors were contrasted, was now faded and worn. Heavy curtains of rose damask were held back by carved water lilies, and the new occupant looked with surprise on a degree of elegance she had not expected to find in so new a country. She expressed something of this, and Eady pompously replied: 
               "De 'plenishin' o' dis 'partment were brung from France when de mistis were a rich young heiress. She chose 'em in Paris herself, an' a vessel what b'longed to her father brung her back from school, wid all de fine things she bought wi' de money dat neber was put away when she wanted to spend it." 
               "Did you live with your mistress in those days, Eady?" 
               "No, 'deed, I wishes I had. I belongs to the marster, sure 'nuff, for he got me an' my ole man arter he married de rich Madame Mendon. I only came to live wi' her jest afore she departed." 
               "Departed? where to?" asked Adrienne. "If she died, you use a strange form of speech." 
               "Hi! sure 'nuff, now, you aint usen to nigger talk, or you'd a know'd dat I meant to tell you of her death. Yes, de angels came for her, but dey carn't hold her so fast but she can come to me sometimes." 
               The old woman ominously shook her head, and Adrienne apprehensively asked: 
               "Do you really believe that the spirits of the dead can return to us? Oh, do not tell me that this room is haunted by its former occupant, for I shall fear to remain in it." 
               "Oh, Lor', chile! you needn't get so white, like, for de White Terror don' come in here. She had too much trouble in dis room to make her willin' to come back to it." 
               "The White Terror," repeated Adrienne, faintly. "Then my grandfather was not jesting, and the old house is really haunted." 
               "Don't get frighted, young mistis, caze she aint goin' to come arter you. It's de ole house she walks in, for she lived thar in happiness wi' de husban' her father married her to. Dis was her 'partment when she was married to your grandfather, and de life she led wi' him wasn't sich as would make her come back to de places where dey was together." 
                
               "Did he treat her badly?" asked Adrienne, with an irrepressible desire to learn something more of Madame Lecour's history. Eady shook her head, and replied almost in a whisper: 
               "Take my 'vice, young mistis, an' don' ax no questions 'bout your gran'pa. He mought find it out, an' you 'member what he said to you jes' now." 
               The young girl colored at this rebuff, and Eady crossed the room and unclosed the wide doors of the armoire. On one side it was filled with shelves, but the opposite one, in place of having the usual supply of hooks for suspending ladies' dresses, revealed a plain door with a small steel knob communicating with a spring. The old woman touched this, and the door flew back, revealing a dark, narrow stairway, leading evidently to the room below. 
               "It were a whim o' de mistis dat de steps shouldn't be seen, an' she thought dis contrivance very clever. Dere is a slidin' pannel in de wall o' de lower room, wi' a knob like dis one, an' you can allers get through when you choose to go down stairs. In mistis' day a lamp used to hang dere, but you'll have to get along widout dat 'commodation, caze de marster keeps so much light hisself, he don't 'low much to other people." 
               Adrienne looked into the dark abyss that seemed to open at her feet, and with a shiver said: 
               "I believe I shall keep this doorway closed, and use the staircase leading from the gallery. I would rather walk in the open air than to go through such a dreary, musty-looking place as that." 
               "I 'spect you'll change your mind afore you've been here very long," replied Eady, significantly. "Your gran'pa aint fond o' new faces, an' some days he'll hardly let me come anigh him to bring him his vittles, fond as he is of eatin' of 'em. I stren'ously 'vise you to keep out o' his way when he ramps an' rages 'round like a mad creetur, as he sometimes does." 
               "Good heavens! is M. Lecour really subject to attacks of madness? If he is, I shall scarcely feel safe beneath the same roof with him." 
               Eady impressively replied: 
               "Ef you has any other place to go to, I'd 'vise you not to stay in dis ole dismal house, caze you'll die o' de blue debbils ef you 'scapes de marster's furies, though I don't 'zactly consider him out o' his mind, only a leetle cracked in de upper story, an' de stuff he chews makes him kind o' wild sometimes, an' he does strange things." 
               Adrienne listened to this account with a sinking heart. Here she must remain, for she had no other refuge on earth. She was friendless, homeless, and could claim no other shelter beside that afforded her by this singular old man. She felt how impossible it was for her to claim the hospitality of Madame Crozat, even if forced to leave her present asylum, for she saw that Adolphe would speedily ask her to become his wife. Before they parted, Madame Crozat had broadly hinted her son's passion, and her own willingness to waive all considerations of fortune, and accept her as M. Mendon' choice. 
               The young girl felt grateful for their kindness, yet there seemed to her to be a motive lurking behind it which she was unable to fathom. Attracted first by the beauty and isolated position of Mademoiselle Durand, on ascertaining her connection with M. Lecour, both mother and son seemed to be inspired with the warmest interest in her future. They repeatedly questioned her about her early recollections, and the circumstances which led to her being placed in a convent to be educated. Adrienne could only remember that her earliest associations were connected with the convent, for she had been placed under the care of the Superior before her perceptive faculties came into exercise. 
                
               She had always been told that her mother died when she was in her third year, and it was the wish of her only surviving relative that she should assume the veil when she attained a suitable age. 
               Her new friends listened with absorbing interest. They consulted together, discussed probabilities known to themselves, and finally insisted that the young traveller should not throw herself on the protection of M. Lecour, but accompany Madame Crozat to her own residence. Thus her future fate would be at their disposal, but the refusal of Adrienne to accept the proffered hospitality frustrated their well-laid plans. 
               Had no other attachment existed, Adrienne would have felt it to be impossible to give her hand to M. Mendon. He was nearly twice her age, and by no means attractive to her. She respected him, felt grateful to him for the services he rendered her, but in her estimation love was something too precious to be given in exchange for lands and gold. He had thought to tempt her with the description of the stately home in which he had dwelt with his first wife in the island of Jamaica, of which she was a native, and hinted that he could afford to keep a second choice, even if destitute of fortune herself, in the same splendor that had surrounded his lost Sylvie. Then he dwelt on the secluded and monotonous existence she must lead with her eccentric grandfather, but Adrienne listened unmoved in her purpose; she was free from conventual restraint, and she could bear a few months of seclusion, with the buoyant hope in her young heart that her lover would remain true to her; she would win a place in the heart of the old man, whose life she hoped to brighten, and in time he must lend a favorable ear to their attachment. From his great wealth he would portion her, and in good time they could be united. 
               These were but the dreams of hopeful youth, and already she beheld them vanishing before the grim reality presented by M. Lecour's appearance and manner. All that now remained, was to bear the cross which she had voluntarily assumed, with as much patience as she could summon to her assistance. She would endeavor to have faith in the future, for a few months might open to her a pathway in which she could walk with Victor by her side, and contented love within her heart. 
               Thus dreaming, she followed Eady from side to side, as she opened drawers and cabinets, and showed her the elegant articles which had been collected by her mistress, and carefully stored away by herself lest dust or damp should injure them. Among them were exquisite china ornaments, parian statuettes representing miniature copies of the most celebrated statues of antiquity, and several cameos, carved with delicate skill. A case filled with a collection of medals, and a portfolio containing a number of drawings made by Madame Lecour herself, were deeply interesting to Adrienne, as affording some insight in the pursuits of her predecessor in that apartment. 
               "Now I'm goin' to show you somethin' real grand," said Eady. "But you mus' neber hint to my marster dat you's seen 'em; caze he'd fairly take my head off for lettin' on dat sich valerable things is kep' in de ole house." 
               "Then it will be better perhaps, for you not to show them at all," suggested Adrienne. 
               The old woman sturdily replied: 
               "It won't do any harm as I knows on, an' you may as well see 'em as not. Fact is, I likes to look at 'em once in a while myself, for dey's mortal fine." 
               With great solemnity, she looked over a bunch of keys, and selecting one of a peculiar shape, inserted it in the lock of an antique, inlaid cabinet. The doors unclosed and revealed several jewel cases with their lids lifted, and their glittering contents exposed to view. A magnificent parure of diamonds flashed back the light of day; a garniture of pearls lay upon the dark velvet of the next; but the most attractive was a set of opals, which seemed to drink in the light of the sun as it streamed in upon them, and momentarily kindle to a deeper splendor as their fiery hearts received new fuel from the day beams. 
               The young girl eagerly stretched forth her hand to lift them from their bed, but the negress withheld her. 
               "No, young mistis, you mustn't tech 'em, for de madame placed 'em dere wi' her own han' de day afore-Well-nebber mind when-but dey's jes as she laid 'em down out o' her white fingers, an' it seems to me dat I can see her lily han' flitterin' over 'em as I seen her put 'em away for de las' time." 
               "Where! I see nothing," said Adrienne, with a shiver, for she was completely unnerved, and took the assertion of the old woman as a literal fact. 
               "Oh chile, I jes' sees it in my mem'ry, dat's all." 
               Adrienne drew a long breath, and pointing to a deep drawer in the lower part of the cabinet, asked: 
               "What is kept in there?" 
               Eady replied by unlocking the drawer, and displaying folds of silk and lace, yellowed by time, and want of use. She took out a bridal robe, and held it up. 
               "Dis were worn wi' de diamonds, when the Madame married to please her father. Dere was gran' doin's den, for de ole man had sot his heart on de match, an' at las' 'suaded her inter it." 
               It was point lace, looped with orange blossoms, now crushed and faded. Eady then took out a plain white silk with no ornament whatever-she went on: 
               "She wore dis one when she give her hand to my present marster, an' I's bin tole dat de fire stones yonder was all de ornymen' she put on. Hi! but dey showed de fiery trials she had to pass through wi' him." 
               There was also a third dress of plain muslin, with only a few knots of white ribbon. Eady dubiously surveyed it, as she said: 
               "I never knowed what dis were worn for, but I reckin de pearls went wi' it; for I's seen de Madame shed tears 'nuff over it to make a bushel o' pearls. Dere was some mighty sorrowful 'membrances b'longing to dis dress, I's sure, but I never knowed what dey was." 
               "And what is in that small yellow bundle?" asked the inquisitive stranger, who had become vividly interested in all these details. 
               "Ah dat have always been a mystry to me. Dey's baby's close-a complete suit on 'em, wi' lace an' all kinds o' dainty work; but to my knowledge de mistis never had a child o' her own. I don' 'no why she'd keep de close b'longin' to other people's chil'ren 'mong her most precious persessions. Yes-dat am a mystry, I can't git at no how." 
               With a feeling of eager interest for which she could not account, Adrienne lifted the bundle and unrolled it. A complete suit of infant's wearing apparel appeared, which had evidently been made at home, and the loving care with which it had been prepared was evinced by the dainty needle work, and fine materials used. 
               With a strange thrill of emotion, the young girl looked over these tiny memorials of a young mother's care and tenderness, and warm tears sprang to her eyes. A whole history of maternal hope, joy, and final anguish, arose before her fancy. As she rolled them together again, a strange, electric shiver ran through her frame, thrilling every fibre of her being, and arousing that latent prescience which was the gift of her impressible organization. In spite of her efforts to keep them open, her eye-lids drooped, and a singular trance fell upon her: a hallucination she then thought it. 
               She beheld as in a vision, two women kneeling beside the couch of a sleeping infant. Both were weeping, and one was clad in deep mourning. Their hands were clasped together, but suddenly the one who seemed in the greatest distress, drew the hand of her companion over the heart of the child, and seemed to be exacting from her a promise. With many tears and caresses, she lifted the slumbering babe, and placing it in the arms of her companion, then buried her own face in the pillow on which the dear head had lately rested, her whole frame seeming convulsed with anguish. 
               The voice of Eady aroused Adrienne from her momentary trance, and her wandering senses returned to find the bundle plucked from her grasp, and the old woman in great fright exclaiming: 
               "I clar to Moses! young mistis, I hope you aint subjec' to fits, for I thought you was a fallin' inter one over these here ole yaller duds. What makes you look so white? Do the musk I put mong' 'em make you sick?" 
               "Perhaps it was that which so singularly affected me," she replied, anxious to find some natural cause for the sudden glimpse of an inner power hitherto unsuspected by herself. Adrienne had often been told of persons possessed by evil spirits, and she had given implicit credence to the tales whose truth was vouched for by those in whose piety she possessed entire confidence. With sudden fear she asked herself if she had become one of those accursed ones, by forsaking the holy home in which she had been carefully reared? The mere thought filled her with superstitious dread, and she felt a sense of relief when Eady closed the cabinet, and said: 
               "I spec' you is tired now, an' would like to res' a bit. De room is damp an' cool, an' I'll sen' my ole man up wi' a armfull o' wood to make you a fire." 
                
               "Thank you; but it is a long time till night, and I had rather go with you to your part of the house." 
               The old woman looked keenly at her. 
               "I hope you aint afraid to stay up stairs in broad daylight, chile, caze of you is, de Lor' only knows what is to become o' you in de long dark nights." 
               "I am not afraid-I am only restless, and I have a natural desire to explore the house in which I am to live in future." 
               "I'm sorry for you, honey, ef you has to stay here long. It's bad 'nuff for Pierre an' me, widout sich as you comin' to dis mouldy ole place. We b'longs to do marster, an' mus' do his will, but sich a bloomin' young creetur' as you ought to have somebody what is willin' to take you out o' dis, an' make you happy in yer own way." 
               A faint smile crept to Adrienne's lip as the soothing thought came that there was one who would leave no means untried to save her from a prolonged residence beneath that banned roof. She did not choose to take Eady into her confidence, and merely saying: 
               "I must content myself here for the present," she motioned to the old woman to precede her down the dark and unknown staircase. It proved to be sufficiently wide and easy of descent, and the spring which held the panel below, at once obeyed the touch that had so long been familiar with it. At the request of Eady, the young girl tried it herself and found that she could easily manage it. 
               A statue of Prosepine was place in front of the opening, and slightly stooping, Adrienne stepped into the lower apartment. 
               Glad to have found a listener, the garrulous old woman chattered on: 
               "Dere's been gran' dion's in dis house, but it were afore my time: I's only hearn tell on 'em, for I were brung here only 'jes afore de Madame went from among us. Oh, dat were a sad day for us all. But what is de matter of you? I 'clar to Moses, you 'm gwine off agin in a dead faint." 
               As Adrienne crossed the dark stain upon the floor, that sharp thrill again pierced her being, and she shrank aside, faint and pale, with a sickening dread she had no power to conquer. She pointed to the floor, and whispered: 
               "What is it? What caused that spot?" 
               The negress turned of an ashen hue, and she visibly trembled, though she affected to laugh, as she replied: 
               "Hi! you makin' all dis pother 'bout a cup o' spilled coffee dat I forgot to wash off de floor. You mustn't be fanciful, young mistis, or you'll go wild in dis queer ole place." 
               "I believe I am half wild now-let us get out of this room, there is a feeling of death in it. I seem to behold a struggle-a blow-and, oh, there is blood-blood upon the blade!" 
               The old woman looked wildly upon the fixed pallid features, the heavy drooping eyelids, and, seizing her hand, dragged her from the spot. 
               With a shudder the illusion passed away, and Adrienne, obeying the impulse of the negress's hand, followed her from the room. Eady gazed at her with a terrified expression. What manner of person was this? a girl seemingly gifted with second sight had entered this house, so jealously guarded from the prying eyes of the world, that its dreary secrets might be kept from its knowledge. 
               Had she been sent hither to unveil them? to bring retribution upon the old tyrant, who lived in his tower as a tiger in his den, for the crimes he had perpetrated? Eady, with an untutored sense of justice, hoped it might be so, for she knew that which cried aloud for vengeance. She dared not speak herself, for she feared her master above all creatures, but she lived in the hope that one would yet be found who would possess the courage to denounce him. She sighed as she remembered that this young girl could scarcely be that accuser, for she was of his own race, and therefore bound to protect him against the consequences of his evil deeds as far as lay in her power; and she dismissed the dawning hope that right might be done through the medium of the new inmate of Bellair. 
               Adrienne shivered with fear as the consciousness of this newly developed power dawned within her. She asked herself for what purpose it had been given? Was it for evil or for good? She tried to reason with herself-to prove to her own satisfaction that the uncertainty of her reception by M. Lecour, which had so long lain as an incubus upon her mind-the excitement which had deprived her of appetite, and the dispiriting events of the day-had given a morbid tendency to her mind. With a good night's rest her nerves would be restored to a healthy and natural equilibrium, and she would then clearly see that an excitable imagination was only playing fantastic tricks upon her, which her native good sense must enable her to correct. 
               Resolute to banish the phantasm which had so thrilled her inmost being, Adrienne followed Eady across the lower gallery into the body of the house. It did not seem to have been built on any architectural plan, but as if room after room had been added as the need for them arose. Such, in fact, had been the origin of the old manorial residence on which it had been modelled: for in his desire to reproduce the home of his boyhood, M. Montreuil had ignored convenience. With such materials as were at his command, he had built a chateau with winding corridors, badly ventilated rooms, and antique towers; but the wood and plaster he had been forced to use, in place of stone and cement, were already falling to decay, and wearing as venerable an appearance as a castle of the feudal ages might have done in a climate less damp and variable. 
               Eady unlocked door after door, revealing sumptuous furniture, now faded and musty with disuse; but the absence of dust showed that the old woman was not unfaithful to the trust reposed in her. Adrienne walked through them as one in a vague dream, and she scarcely heard the incessant chattering of the old woman. She presently asked: 
               "Why did Madame Lecour give up these fine rooms, and prefer the tower to live in?" 
               Eady shook her head: 
               "She tuck a dislike to dese 'partments arter de death o' her husbin an' father. She were a fanciful kind o' lady, an' as she had plenty o' money, she did as she pleased. But in her day, de great house wasn't given up to de vermin-she filled it with company, an' sich junketing frolickin', an' dancin' never was hearn tell of in dis country. De madame was a mighty gay widder, I b'lieves." 
               "And how did she live after her union with M. Lecour?" 
               "Ah, chile, as soon as he came in possession all dat was put a stop to. I's been tole he allers was a strange man; but how he persuaded a gay young widder like de Madame to marry him, nobody could understan': de servants thought he bewitched her-you know, honey, dat niggers is fools 'nuff to b'lieve in sich things. Howsomedever, let dat be as 'twill, she married him, though all her frien's was scandalized 'bout it, an' de Mendon family threatened to prove dat she couldn't be in her right mind. You see, de estate was hern, to do as she pleased wi', an dey didn't want her to marry agin." 
               "Had they any particular objection to M. Lecour?" 
               "Well, I reckin dey had, for he were a stranger in dese parts, an' too ole by twenty year for de Madame. But dey says, de oddest part of de whole matter was, dat de Madame seemed unhappy in de thought o' marrying him, yet she 'fended all her frien's by doin' so." 
               "It is indeed a singular history; and they were not happy together, I am afraid." 
               "Happy? Oh, Lor'! I don't 'spec' she ever thought o' sich a thing wi' him. He shet up de house, sold her carriage, an' put de hosses in de plow; 'fended everybody she cared for, an' when she were left to his mercy, he 'mured hisself in one tower, an' made her live in de other. She bore it, you see, caze she had braved de anger o' all her frien's to marry him, an' she had a sperrit o' her own dat made her willin' to bear de consequins widout axin' for help. De marster sent all de ole servants away, an' bought my ole man an' me, wi' our dumb chile, what didn't live very long arterwards." 
               "And you were with Madame Lecour when she died?" asked Adrienne. 
               A singular expression flitted over the face of the old woman, and she replied: 
               "Oh, aye-sartinly-sartinly-I were wi' her, for I loved her-'deed I did, for she were a sweet lady, an' what seems sing'lar to me, you looks mightily like her." 
               "So M. Mendon thought," said Adrienne, musingly. "Yet I am in no way related to her. But why are you turning from this door? Let us enter this room, if you please." 
               "It aint no use, for deys only lumber rooms, an' you'd only git your black dress siled wi' de dust. Dere's nothin' in thar but a passel o' ole trash dat aint werf lookin' at." 
               Adrienne looked steadily at her; she said: 
               "Access is gained to the highest floor through this door, I believe?" 
               "Yes, dat am a fac', but dey's only lumber rooms up dere." 
                
               "Something tells me that you are deceiving me, for purposes of your own; but I will not insist on seeing those rooms at present. The time will come when I shall enter them with M. Lecour's consent." 
               The old woman's voice trembled, as she asked: 
               "Is you possessed, young mistis, dat you talk in dis circumambular style? I b'lieve I'll cross myself to banish the evil one from us bofe." 
               Adrienne faintly smiled; but she, too, made the sign of the cross in the air, and turned away without further reference to the unopened rooms. She was glad to follow Eady into the open air, and shake off the gloomy impression made by the solitude and desolation amid which she had been wandering. 
               Eady opened an outer door, which led into a vegetable garden kept in order by the labor of Pierre. Her own domicile fronted this, and near it bloomed a few hardy flowers of such gaudy hues as are most prized by the race to which she belonged. A poultry-yard was in the rear of the cabin, swarming with chickens, turkeys, and geese. These Eady displayed with great pride, commenting upon their different characteristics with much shrewdness. 
               "Chickens am giddy things, young mistis, what never thinks o' nothin' hap'nin' to 'em, tell dey's had de head wrung off, an' den dey flutters 'bout in a state o' surprise tell de blood's mos' lef de body." 
               Adrienne shivered, and vaguely muttered: 
               "I would give much to know if consciousness is left in the body while these convulsions go on. Did the victims of the guillotine feel the pangs of mortality after the knife had done its work?" 
               "Ask him, an' mayhap he can tell you," said Eady, pointing significantly in the direction of M. Lecour's tower. "Ef you could see what is in dat room under his'n, you'd think dey could." 
                
               "What is in there then?" 
               "Only picters o' people, but deys dreffle to look at; all on 'em has dere heads cut off, an' you can see whar de knife went 'roun'. He don't know dat I's seen 'em, but I has. But, 'bout dese fools; you know people allers says 'what a goose' when any one have done some mighty silly thing; but it's my 'pinion dey orter say what a turkey, for dey's sich born naturals dey can't take care o' dere own young ones, but carries 'em inter all manner o' on'countable places. But de geese-lor! love you, chile, dey is as wise as white folks; dey allers has a guard sot when dey goes to sleep, an' dey shows de judgment o' humans sometimes-I clar to Moses dey does." 
               Adrienne half smiled, as she replied: 
               "Your observation only confirms what history tells us of their sagacity. A great city was once saved by their cackling, though I do not think it is very pleasant music. But pray tell me about this room of M. Lecour's. If you can look into it, why cannot I also do so? Has he forbidden it to every one?" 
               "I reckin he have, an' ef he knew dat I had peeped inter it, I don' know what de consequins mought be. I'm talkin' to you mighty free, chile, but I feels somehow, dat you'll not make a harmful use o' my gabble. I don't often find any one to talk wi', 'cept dat ole husbin' o' mine, an' he's kind o' stupid, an' goes to sleep half de time when I'm demystatin' my mos' 'lectable idees." 
               "You need not fear my indiscretion. I feel too much in awe of M. Lecour myself to betray any of your confidences to him. I thought my grandfather lived on a large plantation." 
               "So he do; but de great house is shet off from de place by de trees dat has been 'lowed to grow so thick around it. De quarter is a mile off, an' de oberseer lives thar. He comes over once a month to make his 'port to marster." 
                
               "And do you never visit the people at the quarter?" 
               "Bless you, no, honey; de marster don't 'low it on no 'count: an' ef any o' de people was to come over here, dey knows dat de bloodhoun' he keeps would be let loose on 'em. I never puts my foot off dis place, 'cept once in a while to go to de landin' wi' Pierre to git sich things from de sto as he aint no judge o'." 
               "Do you not find this life very dreary? 
               "You may say dat, honey; but I has Pierre to fuss arter, an' de marster to look to, 'sides de chickens and things to feed But what'll you do in dis ole den arter you gits settled down, for you won't have a yethly thing to 'muse you." 
               "Oh I shall find something to do. I will read, and it I could get a musical instrument I would keep up my practice. I can contrive some kind of employment for myself, be sure of that." 
               "I hope so, but ef I hearn the soun' o' music in Castle Dismal, I should think de worl' were comin' to a eend sure 'nuff. You'll never bring dat to pass, young mistis." 
               "I shall make the effort, at any rate. I trust that I may yet be able to bring back some enjoyment to the lonely heart of my poor old grandfather. He has been too long in solitude. I came hither to be his good angel, and I must accomplish my mission. It may be long before I can establish an influence over him, but I trust that I shall eventually succeed in rendering myself useful to him." 
               Eady shook her head ominously. 
               "Ah, chile, you is young an' hopeful. You doesn't know as much as I knows, or you wouldn't 'spec' much from heabenly mistrations to sich a ole sinner as my marster. But I aint gwine to put de good 'tention out o' yer mine. Jes' do the bes' you can, an' dat is all dat's 'quird o' yethly creeters." 
               Adrienne smilingly assented to this wise conclusion, and the old chatterbox went on: 
                
               "I's done shewed you everythin' now, young mistis, an' I aint got no more time to waste in talkin'. Mebbe you'd better go up to yer own own room, an' kinder get usen to its looks afore night comes on. It makes some people narvyus to sleep in a strange place, and young gals is apt to take notions. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VII. 
               A VISION OF TERROR. 
               THUS dismissed Adrienne returned alone through the desolate mansion, and with nerves excited to the highest point of sensibility, she shrank at the echo of her own steps as she flitted through the long and lonely halls. She ran up the staircase and made a momentary pause in front of the door Eady had refused to unclose for her; she was tempted to try the lock, but a sudden fear of what might be found within, deterred her, and with fleet steps she sped down again, and soon gained the door of her tower room. 
               Carefully closing it behind her, the young girl paused before ascending to her own apartment, to snatch another glance at the vailed portrait. With a tremulous hand she turned aside the curtain, and a ray of sunshine from a half open shutter fell upon the face. She started at the sudden illumination, and fearfully glanced around to see if it proceeded from a natural cause. 
               The painting represented a woman of mature beauty, wearing a green riding habit, and hat with a dark plume which fell upon her shoulder and mingled with the blonde curls that hung as a golden glory around the white throat. The face was smiling, but it was one which suffering had deeply touched. A sorrow that gnawed the deeper from being concealed, seemed to throw its shadow over the lovely features, and few could long gaze upon that fair face without a vague feeling of tenderness and compassion for the highbred heiress of lands and gold, who seemed to be in the zenith of fortune and happiness when that picture was taken, yet in whose heart and life had crept the canker of an incurable sorrow. 
               Adrienne too saw that it was like herself-like what she might become when time and suffering had developed her into perfect womanhood. Now, it was only the vague resemblance of the young bud to the stately flower. After a long and earnest gaze into the deep sad eyes, Adrienne dropped the curtain, with the exclamation: 
               "How strange! I seem to myself to belong more to her, than to the terrible old man up stairs." 
               In passing to the recess in which was the sliding panel, Adrienne took especial care not to walk over the stain upon the floor; but even with this precaution, she could not repress the shudder that thrilled her sensitive frame, and she muttered: 
               "It is blood! I feel it-I know it; though the old woman declared it was only a coffee stain." 
               The spring readily yielded to her touch, and she stood within the darkened stairway. With the unutterable dread that something might impede her steps, she groped her way upward, and finally reached the upper floor. She glanced around the room half fearfully, for all that had happened that day contributed to fill her mind with superstitious dread, and with a sigh of relief, she threw herself into a large chair which was placed near one of the windows. 
               The sash had been raised, for Eady kept the apartments under her charge scrupulously aired, and Adrienne unbolted the shutter, that she might obtain a glimpse of the scene without. A magnificent oak, with long, trailing wreaths of moss hanging in picturesque festoons, grew just in front of the window, completely concealing the country beyond. The heart of the desolate stranger shrank within her, when she thought that this dreary house, with its strange inmates, was henceforth to be her home. 
               Adrienne had parted from her lover, in the sanguine belief that she would find peace and happiness under the protection of M. Lecour. Trustful and affectionate by nature, she had never doubted her power ultimately to win a place in his heart, and induce him to endow her with sufficient fortune to render possible her union with her lover. This hope had sustained her courage amid all she had gone through to reach his home, but now it had perished before the miserable realities of the difficult position in which she was placed. She sat down with a feeling of utter forlornness and abandonment, and wept such tears as youth is seldom called upon to shed. 
               The sound of lumbering footsteps upon the stairs aroused her from, the indulgence of her feelings, and she gazed with dilating eyes and half-parted lips upon the open door, expecting some goblin dire to make its appearance through it. With a sensation of intense relief, she saw a black face, ugly enough for a goblin, but with a human expression of pleasure at her presence there, and old Pierre came in, bearing a bundle of wood, with which he proceeded to light a fire from a few coals he carried in an iron pan. 
               With strangers, Pierre was as silent as his wife was talkative, and he hovered over the blaze he soon created, like a dark gnome from some central earth-fire, from which he had filched the materials for this; but he spoke not a syllable to the young girl, whose advent among them had been a delightful surprise to them. 
               Adrienne thanked him gratefully for his attention to her comfort, and the old negro's tongue was at once unloosed. He sententionsly replied: 
                
               "It's my bizness to make de fires, mistis, an' it's my pleasure to make one for sich a nice-lookin' young lady as you is. I'll allers keep you a good supply o' wood, an' den you kin keep your fire a burnin' through all de dark hours. You'll find dat a comfort, I reckin, in dis strange house. Now I mus' ten' to marster's fire, an' ef you'll let me through de door on de gal'ry, I sha'n't have to come up de dark stairs and scare you agin." 
               Adrienne blushed faintly at his accurate interpretation of her feelings, and replied, apologetically: 
               "Everything here is so strange to me that every sound startles me. I shall overcome this feeling in a few days, and I hope you will not think that I am afraid of you." 
               "Oh no, Mam'selle, I ain't sightly to look at, I know very well, but ole Pierre's face have never got to be fearsome to any one yet. Least-ways shall it be to you, for you looks like some o' de ole stock, sure enuff; an' your voice sounds mighty familiar in de ole house." 
               "And yet I am not of their blood," thought Adrienne, "but an interloper, who is unwelcome to him who now claims the mastery here." 
               She unlocked the outer door, again gracefully thanked him for his attention to her wants, and turned to the more cheerful-looking room with emotions of gratitude to this poor old creature, for the kindly sympathy he had shown for her loneliness. 
               "My own blood treats me as an alien," was her bitter thought, "while this untutored menial can feel compassion for my isolated and forlorn position." 
               The fire leaped and flashed up the chimney, and the quaintly-carved furniture glittered in its beams. Adrienne began to feel less nervous, and by the time Eady came up with her tea, she had made herself quite comfortable in her new quarters. The old woman stayed but a few moments, as her master was waiting for his supper, which she bore upon the same waiter. Adrienne was glad to drink the tea, and then occupy herself with a book which M. Lecour was considerate enough to send in to her. As Eady finally withdrew her head from the door, she warningly said: 
               "Don't you come out o' yer room, nor take no notice of any noises you may hear, young mistis, caze it may be wuss for you den you may think, ef de marster were to come 'cross you in one o' his tantrums. He cuts up mightily some nights, and he is in one o' his spells now." 
               At the sound of M. Lecour's voice she abruptly closed the door and went to him. Pierre brought up a supply of wood for the night, and a candle, which he advised her to economize as much as possible, as his master did not permit many to be burned by any one in his establishment except himself. 
               With a heavy sinking of the heart, the young stranger listened to his departing footsteps as they clattered down the staircase, and she tried to combat the sense of loneliness by the thought that the length of the gallery only separated her from her grandfather; and stern as he was, should the nightmare of fear come upon her, she would overcome her dread of offending him, and fly to him for companionship. 
               Later in the evening Eady again came quietly up, bearing the valise of Adrienne, and stayed long enough to prepare the bed for its new occupant. Reiterating her cautions, the old woman at length disappeared for the night, and Adrienne was left to solitude. 
               After exchanging her black robe for a dressing gown, she drew up the large chair in front of the fire and sat down to contemplate the miniature of Victor Duvernay, which she wore next her heart concealed in a small golden case. A touch upon a spring revealed a dark, nobly handsome face, surrounded by a waving mass of jet black hair. Certain that no intrusive eyes could behold her, the young girl pressed the senseless ivory to her lips and heart, and murmured words of tender devotion which she would scarcely have been willing to express to the original. She fell into a dreamy reverie, and sinking in the depths of her luxurious chair, she felt a sense of repose, after the varied excitements of the day, stealing over both mind and body. 
               She slept, at first lightly and fitfully, but gradually her senses more deeply steeped themselves in the oblivion of slumber, and the soul flitted away to the weird realms of dreams. 
               She stood in a dungeon plunged in the blackness of darkness, and groped around in search of an opening that might afford her egress. Suddenly, in the far distance appeared a faint, starry radiance, as if a vista of vast length had been made visible by the luminous object that steadily and rapidly approached her. As it advanced it grew in size and brilliancy, until it became impossible to fix the dazzled vision upon it. 
               As the dreamer cast down her eyes to avoid the oppressive glare, a pathway was made clear to her vision, winding among obstructions which appeared insurmountable. A close scrutiny, however, showed that the narrow way wound ingeniously around these obstacles, and the traveller who would patiently pursue the tortuous path must eventually overcome them. 
               At its terminus in the far, far distance, stood a misty form, which, from its garments, radiated a softened lustre that seemed divine in its origin. A voice issued from this which distinctly said: 
               "Mortal, walk with a strong heart in the path appointed thee, for with courage and good intent all things are possible." 
               Suddenly the star seemed hurled with a great noise toward ward the mystic figure, and shrieks filled the air. Awaking with a wild start, Adrienne thought she was surely in pandemonium, for cries, stamping, and the deep baying of a blood-hound filled her confused senses with fright. 
               The fire had gone down, and the room was only illumined by the glowing embers. She threw a few faggots upon the hearth, and by the time they kindled in a blaze, Adrienne recovered sufficient composure to comprehend that the cries proceeded from the room of M. Lecour, and the deep baying of the dog ascended from the lower apartment of his tower. 
               The frantic scenes of the preceding night were evidently being re-enacted, and the lonely stranger listened with a degree of terror that completely unnerved her frame. Remembering his own words and Eady's caution, she sat still and trembling, fearing every moment that the madman would remember her vicinity, and burst into her room. 
               Suddenly the uproar ceased; the drug had produced its last phase, and the frantic actor in the scene lay supine upon his couch. After a few prolonged wails, the dog also sunk into silence, but the frightened girl sat cowering in her chair, afraid to look around, terrified even by the sound of her own perturbed breathing, which now alone broke the deep silence that fell on everything within the house. 
               The faint rustle of the breeze, and the answering cry of nightbirds that lived unharmed among the unpruned trees, were the only interruptions to the profound quiet of the night. Gradually the quick fluttering of her heart subsided, and she gained courage to look around; a sense of chilliness reminded her that she would be better in bed, and in a few moments she was safely ensconced in the antique bedstead in the corner. Eady had loosened the lace curtains, and they fell to the floor in light, filmy folds. By the uncertain flashes of fire-light, Adrienne gazed upon the rich furniture, and mused upon the fair woman whose taste had decorated the apartment, till slumber again fell softly upon her eyelids. 
               This time she slept dreamlessly for several hours, and then a most extraordinary vision passed before her; with all her efforts, she could only arouse herself to a half consciousness of the singular scene that seemed to be acting in her room, and she found herself wondering if this was another hallucination similar to those which she had experienced on the preceding day. 
               The fire yet glowed upon the hearth, and by its glimmer, a tall figure was seen in front of the mirror arraying herself in the bridal dresses which Eady had that morning exhibited. She first assumed the white muslin, and decked herself with the pearls. Pale as a snowdrift, with dishevelled hair, white as silver, and an expression of intense melancholy upon her features, she surveyed herself with moans of deep anguish. The pallid lips seemed to unclose, and wail forth the plaintive cry: 
               "Loved and lost-loved and lost! pearls and tears go together. Off! off! ye freeze me to the marrow!" 
               The jewels were snatched from neck, arm and brow, and the dress was hastily laid aside. The splendid bridal robe, with its costly lace, and fairy flowers, was then donned, and the magnificent diamonds flashed above her faded brow, and lay in glittering radiance upon her bared neck and arms. Again the voice came hissingly, and scornfully through the set teeth. 
               "This, for pride, and family peace. They gave me to him, though my heart was with the past; but I played my part well. He cannot reproach me when we meet beyond the stars, for I was true to him, if I did not love him. Off, idle gawds! for my dead heart can tell how vain ye are to impart happiness!" 
                
               In their turn, these too were torn from her person, and consigned to the receptacles to which they belonged. 
               Then with a shudder, she lifted the plain white silk, and held it at arm's length, while she surveyed it with an expression of horror. 
               "Robe of Deijaneira! hateful folds, that glisten to me like the sheen of the serpent that entered the Paradise in which our first parents dwelt, in your turn, I must assume ye for a purpose which I dare not forego." 
               With evident reluctance, the robe was thrown on, and then the opals were brought forth with an expression of loathing upon her features. She turned them toward the glimmering light, and muttered: 
               "Fiery hearts, fiery hearts, well do you typify the one for whom they were worn. A consuming anguish did he light in my soul, and his shall not escape from its blighting influence." 
               When this last toilette was completed, she surveyed herself in the mirror, and then took from a drawer in her dressing-stand a large lace shawl, with which she enveloped her whole person. Carefully unclosing the door, she glided out, and approached the entrance to M. Lecour's apartment. 
               Without any conscious volition on her own part, Adrienne arose and followed her. The white figure paused in front of M. Lecour's door, and softly turned the bolt. The dazzling glare of many lights fell upon her rich costume, for he habitually slept with his room brilliantly illuminated. Approaching the couch on which he lay breathing heavily, the phantom bride stretched forth her arms, and held the cloud of lace in such a manner as clearly to reveal her features, and the wild masses of silver hair, amid which the fiery opals so strangely gleamed. 
               A clear, piercing voice cried out: 
               "Murderer! arouse yourself, for the White Terror is upon you! the White Terror is upon you!" 
                
               With a wild cry, M. Lecour started from the leaden slumber which had lately bound his senses, cast a horrified glance toward the pallid face that bent above him, and fell motionless upon his pillow. 
               Swiftly then the phantom glided back, tore off the loathsome finery, and consigned it to its usual receptacle. As she was leaving the room, her eyes fell upon the bed Adrienne had regained the shelter of before she returned, and now, with her finger pressed upon her lips, she drew near, peered through the transparent curtain, and by the faint light examined the face of the stranger. Adrienne struggled to speak-to ask her why she came there-but the words died away in her throat as she saw the former mistress of Bellair looking down upon her. 
               At this climax the senses of the overwrought girl failed her, and she became unconscious of everything. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               A PLOT TO WIN AN HEIRESS. 
               CORONA, the plantation of Madame Crozat, was situated on the Mississippi river, ten miles from Castle Dismal. It was in a state of high cultivation, and the trim neatness of the lawn, hedges and parterre, was in strong contrast with the neglected grounds around the latter place. 
               The chief building was a large cottage with a high-peaked roof, and heavy projecting galleries. Two smaller houses occupied opposite sides of the yard, for the usual custom of French creoles to erect separate cottages, as the necessity for more room arose, had been followed, in place of joining them as wings to the original building. When M. Mendon brought his sons to reside at Corona, and employed a tutor for them, the smaller houses were erected for their accommodation. A hedge of orange trees surrounded the yard, and clusters of two and three together were scattered over the lawn, where the shade of the larger trees did not fall so heavily as to intercept the warm sun rays so necessary to the development of their fruit. A grape trellis extended along the side next to the large and well kept vegetable garden which was thus screened from observation; for the mistress of Corona was noted as an excellent manager, and a successful planter. The wide carriage sweep was bordered with Otaheite roses, and cape jessamine, so mingled that when in bloom, the scarlet flowers of the one and the opaque white of the other, formed an agreeable contrast. 
               Vases filled with flowering plants stood on each side of the entrance, and the house with its surroundings had an appearance of opulence blended with neatness and good taste, that was extremely pleasing. It was evening, and two dark-haired boys were in front of their cottage playing ball, while a stern-looking, middle-aged man sat on the small portico with a book upon his lap, wearing the garb of a priest, and with cold, ascetic face. This was Father Eustace, the tutor lately employed, and the lads were the sons of M. Mendon. Their mother was a wealthy heiress from St. Domingo, who had now been four years dead; her estate was settled irrevocably upon her children, and their father was not even permitted to have a voice in its management. 
               A small patrimonial estate had been inherited by M. Mendon, but bad management, and wild speculations, had dissipated it long since; and he was ready for any scheme that promised to reinstate his fortunes, before his sons attained such an age as must render his dependence upon them a feeling of pain and inferiority which his temper did not fit him to bear with patience. 
                
               M. Mendon was promenading to and fro upon the long gallery in front of the central building, with his hands clasped behind his back, and his brows knit as if in deep thought. His face was turned towards the boys, when a shout of mirth came to his ears, and he saw the tall, lithe figure of his eldest son in active pursuit of his ball, which had bounded over the grape trellis into the garden beyond. He bit his lip, and muttered: 
               "How fast that lad grows! It seems to me but yesterday that he was in his cradle, and now he makes me feel almost old when I look at him. Heigho! what would Adrienne say if she could see the step-son I would give her. He looks to be nearly as old as she seems." 
               He unconsciously raised his voice, and a lady, who, unperceived, had stepped out of the French window nearest to him, replied: 
               "What does that signify? You are still young enough, and handsome enough, Adolphe, to win the fairest and best dowered girl in this broad State." 
               The speaker was at least sixty years of age; erect, tall and stately as one of the grenadiers of Frederick the Great, with a spare figure and an alertness of motion not often found in women far more youthful than herself. Full of energy and industry, if her sex had been different, Madame Crozat would probably have been known as a great military chieftain. With the assistance of an overseer, she managed her own plantation, and the experiments made by her in the culture of the new staple destined to become of such paramount importance in the history of commerce, had tended to show its value to the more timid planters, who feared to permit cotton to take the place of indigo, the culture of which had hitherto been thought of such importance to the colony. 
               The expression of mingled energy and acuteness that characterized Madame Crozat's features was very striking. The dark, deep set eyes detected every abuse as quickly as those of the most expert policeman, and the firm, clearly cut mouth showed that promptness in action was habitual to her. She used her own judgment, and had no misgivings as to her perfect right to do whatever that pronounced best. 
               The dress of this lady was as unique as her character was decided. For reasons that appeared valid to herself, she utterly repudiated the style of costume worn at that day. She considered it ungraceful, for it scarcely draped the figure at all; the short waist was oppressive to her chest, and the uncovered arms and neck unsuited to her time of life. In its place, she adopted a loose flowing robe of dark material, with sleeves sufficiently large for convenience, fastened closely at the wrists. Her gray hair was combed back from the broad brow, tied on the top of the head, and the ends divided into two long rouleaux, which were brought forward and carried beneath her ears, to be held back by a black silk net. 
               A neck-tie like a man's cravat completed her personal adornment, so far as embellishment went, A pair of substantial leather boots, which were fitted accurately to her well-shaped feet, finished her toilette. 
               Madame Crozat had married twice, and each husband had left her the legacy of a step-child, though she had none of her own. At the time she bestowed her hand on the elder Mendon, his youngest son was a child of seven years-Adolphe was an attractive and engaging lad, and the step-dame soon became warmly attached to him. This attachment had continued unabated throughout her widowhood, although she was then separated from him by his residence under the roof of his brother. Madame Crozat had great respect for money, and the strongest desire of her heart was to see her favorite endowed with the fortune left by his wealthy sister-in-law. She insisted that he possessed the best right to it, for his deceased brother had nearly doubled the value of the estate by his judicious management. 
               Eugene Mendon died suddenly, and his wife, to whom the property originally belonged, retained undisturbed possession. No claim was set up by the relatives of her deceased husband; but when Madame Mendon married again, and perished soon after under very mysterious circumstances, an attempt was made to wrest from M. Lecour at least a moiety of the estate. He brought forward a deed of settlement, purporting to have been made by his late wife, by which the whole of her large fortune was irrevocably secured to himself for life. 
               The decision of the courts was in favor of M. Lecour, and until recent events suggested a new pathway to the fulfillment of their wishes, both mother and son had resigned all hope of acquiring the lost inheritance. 
               Madame Crozat was first attracted toward Adrienne by her beauty and loneliness. They were ten days coming from New Orleans together, and the graceful attentions of the young stranger won sensibly upon her regard. When she learned whither she was going, and the relationship in which she stood toward the bte noir of their family, she lost no time in communicating with her step-son. 
               M. Mendon had also remarked the beauty of the fair, traveller, and had marvelled in his own mind how a creature so young, and evidently so well brought up, should venture to violate the conventional proprieties which hedge in a young girl in France, so far as to pursue her present independent course. He had already been attracted by the remarkable resemblance she bore to his sister-in-law, and the discovery of her connection with M. Lecour awakened in him the liveliest curiosity to learn her antecedents, and if possible, to discover her object in making this long journey to reside with a man who, in his own neighborhood, was considered as verging toward madness, if not actually insane. 
               The confidence of an inexperienced girl of nineteen was not difficult to win, and the friendless traveller soon confided to Madame Crozat the fact that she had evaded the authority of the guardians to whom she had been entrusted, and was in fact a runaway novice, hoping to find freedom and happiness beneath the roof of her unknown relative. 
               The decision of the old lady was at once expressed, that on no account was she to be permitted to take up her residence beneath the banned roof of M. Lecour. She insisted that her own house should become the temporary home of Mademoiselle Durand, till some more satisfactory arrangement could be made for her. But as we have seen, Adrienne persisted in the plan she had originally marked out for herself, and, despotic as the old lady was, she was compelled to yield to the firm purpose of the young girl. 
               At the sound of her voice, M. Mendon turned quickly, and he said, with a slight expression of bitterness, "Ah, Madame Mre, your decision is too partial. The only girl I care just now to win has made me feel that I am no longer young-that she prefers another to me." 
               "Ah, this young runaway has a lover, then. Give me all the particulars of yesterday's interview, Adolphe; I have been so engaged righting things since I came home, that I have had no time to listen to you." 
               "No wonder, Madame Mre," he replied, with a half laugh, "for Franois declares that you have inspected the whole plantation in the last twenty-four hours, detected every abuse, and righted every wrong. I am sure I sometimes envy you your talent for business." 
               "It was the way my father trained me," she quietly responded. "If I had remained in New Orleans two weeks longer, the whole place would have been to remodel. Such waste! such disorder! I declare it was shameful. But let that pass, and tell me about this young girl. Is there a possibility that we shall yet win her consent to come to us?" 
               "None, that I can see, and if she is in love with some other man, it is of no advantage to us to bring her hither." 
               "That is all nonsense; it is but the childish preference of an inexperienced young girl for the first man that spoke of love to her. I thought you understood women better than to believe in such puerile prepossessions. You can soon put this boy lover out of her head, if you choose to turn it with the flattery you so well know how to administer." 
               Mendon shrugged his shoulders, though a faint smile crept to his lips. 
               "You really have a higher opinion of my powers in that line Madame, than I think they deserve. I am afraid Mademoiselle Adrienne's indifference to me is insurmountable. Besides, unless we are sure of our game, it will be a waste of time to induce her to change her mind. I like this young girl better than any one I have seen since my poor Sylvie's death; nay, I believe I could passionately love her, but I cannot marry her unless I am well assured that she must eventually heir the property now held by M. Lecour. You well know, Madame, that I must obtain fortune with the woman on whom I bestow my hand." 
               Madame Crozat sagaciously nodded. 
               "Very well, that is as clear to me as to you; but on either of the chances already discussed, this girl is the best match in the colony. If she is really the grandchild of the old Frenchman, he will naturally leave the estate to her at his death, and that, you know, cannot be very distant, for he is old, and a victim to the strange drug he habitually uses." 
                
               "It is by no means certain that he would so nobly endow her, for it was with great reluctance he received her this morning. I thought once we should conquer, and she would accompany me hither, but suddenly the old savage changed his tone, and the poor deluded child eagerly grasped at any chance to remain in that house which he has cursed with his crimes." 
               "Poor girl, I wish, for her own sake as well as yours, that she had consented to come with us. You may depend on it, Adolphe, M. Lecour remarked that wonderful resemblance to his deceased wife which first attracted us toward this young stranger. That old story cannot be entirely unknown to him, and he could draw his own inferences as easily as we could." 
               "We know nothing with certainty, Madame. There were only vague rumors which were never confirmed, and if Louise had been the mother of a living child, she would never have settled her fortune on this terrible old man in such a manner as to leave it entirely at his own disposal. The resemblance is startling, but I am constrained to believe it accidental, and only as M. Lecour's granddaughter can this young lady claim the noble inheritance I once hoped to call my own." 
               "And which shall yet be yours, if justice is done to all parties concerned," emphatically responded his step-mother. "That the deed was a forgery, I am as well convinced now as I was when it was first brought forward. The tribunal was bribed which gave the decision in Lecour's favor, but we will let that pass for the present. I attach more importance to the claims of this girl than you seem inclined to do, for I am aware of circumstances which singularly prove her true position to be that of heiress to the estate." 
               "Indeed! I thought your information on that head was principally derived from myself." 
                
               "You have forgotten Leonie, the quadroon who accompanied Mademoiselle Montreuil to France, and remained there after her return to Louisiana. By a singular chance, this woman became the sick nurse of M. Crozat's first wife, was with her when she died, and had the exclusive charge of my step-daughter, Pauline, till I married him." 
               "And where is she now to be found? She can give information that may be invaluable to us." 
               "She is here, but not in a condition just now to throw much light on this subject. She has always refused to be separated from her nurseling; and although she was not of much use to me, I gave her a cabin, and permitted her to remain as a sort of hanger-on. During my absence she was attacked by a low fever, and she is now quite delirious. I came from her just now, and in her mutterings the name of Louise Montreuil occurred, coupled with another that I have heard before. Depend on it, the whole story is in the keeping of this woman, if we can only get her to reveal it." 
               "I trust she is not in danger of dying, Madame. It will be too bad to have the clue to this mystery torn from our grasp exactly at the crisis when it is most important to retain it." 
               "She is very low; I have sent for the doctor to see what can be done for her, and you may be sure that I shall leave no means untried to restore her to such a state as will at least enable her to speak rationally, and with certainty of the past." 
               A sudden thought seemed to strike M. Mendon, and he asked, with some solicitude: 
               "If this young girl is the true heir, will she be safe in the power of so unscrupulous a man as we believe M. Lecour to be? He may have better means of ascertaining the truth than we possess, and it may be an imperative duty to remove her from Bellair at once, in spite of any opposition she might make." 
               Madame Crozat shook her head gravely. 
               "We need not proceed to extreme measures yet, for M. Lecour must send to France to gain confirmation of his suspicions, if any have been aroused, and it will be several months before he can get a reply. In the meantime, Leonie may recover, and we have ample time to claim the custody of the heiress." 
               "And in the meantime, how am I to use these flatteries to which you just now referred? Adrienne may as well be in her convent in France as in that gloomy old den, with such an ogre as her guard. He almost ordered me out of his presence, and gave me distinctly to understand that I was to make my appearance in his house no more." 
               "And she did not remonstrate, after all your kindness to her? Did she not seemed grieved that she was not permitted to see the only friends she has in this strange country?" 
               "I daresay she regretted it, but she acquiesced, and accepted his protection on those terms." 
               "Well, after all, it was the only thing the poor girl could do, and I am quite at a loss to know what to propose. She will not come to us, and you cannot go to her-" 
               M. Mendon drew near to her, and almost whispered: 
               "A sudden revelation has come to me. Adrienne has effected her escape from the convent to which she was destined from infancy. No doubt M. Lecour has delegated to the Superior such authority as will enable her to claim the fugitive wherever she may be found within the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church. Can we not take Father Eustace into our counsels, arm him with spiritual power, and threaten to return her to her nunnery?" 
               "And the priest would be very likely to keep his word. That might be the surest means to foil our plans." 
                
               "No-we could step forward to protect her, and save her from Father Eustace, for old Lecour would give her up at once if he believed the bishop demanded her. Don't you see, Madame, that if she is deprived of her present home, and threatened with being sent back to France to be immured for life in her old prison, Adrienne would gladly avail herself of your offer to protect her? Then what would be easier than to convince her that only by giving me her hand can she save herself from this dreaded fate." 
               "But will Father Eustace lend himself to such a purpose? He seems a true ascetic, and I have not been able yet to find out what has brought him from France to dwell in this new country. I am sure he has some ulterior object in view in coming hither." 
               "I have not speculated on that possibility, as I am not particularly interested in his private affairs. However, of one thing I am very sure, and that is, that while in my employment he will not refuse to do anything lawful that I may wish. If I wed the heiress, I will give him a handsome, bonus; if she turns out to have none of the claims with which we have invested her, he can assert the authority of the church over her, and send her back to her convent. Thus we shall be altogether rid of her claims on the inheritance, and on old Lecour's death, I can again sue as the heir of my brother, and possibly obtain a judgment in my favor." 
               The shrewd sense of Madame Crozat repudiated this idea. She said: 
               "The decision has once been against you, and it would be so again, if you ventured on so expensive and useless a measure. No-this young stranger, whether the lawful heiress or not, shall win the estate, and she shall become your wife. I have made up my mind on those two points, and I am not often thwarted in my determinations." 
                
               Mendon laughed: 
               "I only hope you may be able to carry them out in the present instance; but I own I cannot see my way clearly." 
               Madame Crozat whispered: 
               "If Father Eustace is under your control, why can he not be induced to manage it. He goes regularly to Castle Dismal to shrive the old sinner who lives there. He will, doubtless, be with him at the last. Let him prepare such papers as are necessary to give the estate to Mademoiselle Durand. The old man will, doubtless, die in a fit of delirium, brought on by excessive use of stimulants, and in that condition he may be induced to sign anything that may be offered him." 
               "But, after risking so much, suppose the girl defeats me at last by refusing to marry me?" 
               "That is not very likely, but we can provide against the contingency by the hold we must gain over her fate. We can act on your own suggestion, and induce her to believe that she can only evade the veil by becoming your wife." 
               An expression of annoyance passed over M. Mendon's face, and he drily said: 
               "It is true, I suggested that piece of villainy, yet I should scarcely like to owe her consent to become mine to her deeper horror of a conventual life." 
               "Do not suffer sentiment to spoil a good plan, Adolphe. You can easily make her love you after you marry her. Sylvie was devoted to you, and the man who has made one wife happy can surely gain the affections of any woman to whom he may devote himself. Win over Father Eustace, and I will answer for the rest." 
               "Well, I can but follow your counsels, Madame Mre, for they have always proved wise ones; but I am afraid we are planning a great wrong against this confiding girl, who concealed from us no portion of her previous history. She regarded us as fast friends, and we are plotting against her as her worst enemies." 
               "On the contrary, we prove ourselves her best friends by providing a good husband, a home, and future wealth for her. She has an affectionate and grateful nature, and after a few weeks spent in that desolate old mansion, with that horrible old man, she will gladly come to me as a guest. The rest I can safely leave to yourself. Yes, my son, she will love you even before she finds it to her interest to do so." 
               The listener half smiled at this flattering prediction, and Madame Crozat continued: 
               "Father Eustace has risen, and is coming this way now. I leave you to sound him and see if he will enter into our plans." 
               She entered the house, and M. Mendon slowly sauntered into the yard and joined the priest, who, with bowed head and corrugated brow, seemed deeply absorbed in thought. Father Eustace was the ideal of an ascetic minister of the church to which he belonged. Tall, gaunt, and pallid, his body seemed to have suffered from the fast he had imposed upon it, but his features had not acquired that placid calm which is the offspring of a spirit at peace with itself. His dark, restless eyes, tremulous lips, and frowning brow, revealed the striving, stormy soul which wrestled beneath the monk's frock. In secular life his choice would probably have been the battle's front, with the clarion of victory sounding in his ears; his own good sword the means of carving his way to fame and fortune. 
               Disappointment and deep affliction in early life had made him a priest, and as such he had but one ambition-one cherished dream, and that was the supremacy of the great hierarchy to which he belonged. 
               As the two approached each other, Father Eustace looked up, bowed, and would have passed on, but M. Mendon turned in the direction he was pursuing, and said: 
               "I will be the companion of your walk, Father, as I have something to communicate to you which is important to me." 
               "Then I must pause to listen, my son, though I was on my way to repair a piece of negligence which is unaccountable to myself. I had utterly forgotten that this is the day I should have gone to Bellair to hear the confession of its master. But once a month will he receive me, and if I fail to visit him this morning, another month must pass before I am admitted to his presence. In the state of M. Lecour's health, this carelessness might have a fatal result-he may die in his sins, and I should feel myself responsible for the safety of his soul." 
               The lip of the listener curled scornfully, and he said: 
               "Truly the age of miracles cannot be past, if you think any earthly ministration can save a soul so dyed in crime as that of this miserable old man. It is of him I wish to speak with you. We will go toward the stable, and give orders to have a horse saddled and brought after you. In the meantime, we can walk on and dispatch our business without delay." 
               The priest acquiesced, and, after the order was given, the two issued from the yard, and slowly sauntered along under the shade of an avenue of magnificent oaks. M. Mendon did not speak for so long a time that at length Father Eustace gently said: 
               "Well, my son, what have you to say of this unhappy old man?" 
               "Nothing new of him; but are you aware that Castle Dismal has received a new inmate within the last two days?" 
               An expression of incredulity came upon the face of the priest; and he said: 
                
               "It is surely impossible that M. Lecour shall have departed from his habits of seclusion so far as to receive a guest. Who has been hardy enough to ask or accept his hospitality?" 
               "A young lady-and, by ray faith! a fair one, too." 
               Father Eustace suddenly stopped, turned upon him with the vivid glare of passion in his deep black eyes, and asked, with breathless interest: 
               "Who is she? Whence does she come? and what claim has she on this man?" 
               "Really, Father, you manifest such interest in this errant damsel, as might render me jealous, if 'twere not for your cloth: for know that I am half in love with the young lady of whom we are speaking." 
               "Young lady! Who is she? I again ask, Monsieur. Do not trifle, for I am terribly in earnest." 
               "So I perceive, for you are trembling with excitement. Have you not heard that the grand-daughter of M. Lecour came from New Orleans on the same boat with Madame Crozat and myself? that she refused the pressing invitation we gave her to come hither, and preferred going to Bellair at once?" 
               The naturally pale complexion of the priest became livid at this announcement, but instantly recovering his usual stoical self-command, he said: 
               "This young stranger is doubtless an impostor, for the only descendant of M. Lecour is too well guarded in her convent home, to be permitted to make such an escapade as this. Some clever adventurer has heard of his great fortune, and undertakes to personate his heiress." 
               "I believe you are mistaken, Father, for Mademoiselle Durand did not conceal from my mother and myself that she is a fugitive from the convent in which she was educated with a view of taking the vail. The life of a recluse was odious to her, and ignorant of the brutality of her grandfather, she has imprudently thrown herself upon his protection." 
               "Which she will not long retain, for it is my duty to inform the Bishop of these facts, that this contumacious young person may be restored to the bosom of the community she has sinfully forsaken." 
               "Softly-softly, Father-it is of this I wish to speak to you. Mademoiselle Durand declares that she will die sooner than return to the captivity of her convent, and, in certain contingencies, it is my wish, and also that of Madame Crozat, that this young lady may be freed from the control of the church." 
               "And those contingencies?" interrogated the priest, with a cold gravity which contrasted strikingly with his late vehemence. 
               "If she is really the heir of M. Lecour's wealth, it is my purpose to end the struggle between us for this fine property, by making his grand-daughter my wife." 
               "I thought the struggle was already ended by the decision of the law," was the significant reply. 
               "Yes-for the term of M. Lecour's life; but at his death my efforts shall be renewed, unless this marriage can be accomplished." 
               Father Eustace had gained time to reflect, and with downcast eyes and suave manner, he said: 
               "So far as I consistently can, I am bound to consider your interests, and the wishes of your good mother, for I eat of your bread, drink of your cup, and train your children to walk in the paths of faith and truth. For the present I will do nothing against this girl, but if she proves not to be the descendant of M. Lecour, I shall take steps to expose the imposture, and have her punished as she deserves." 
               M. Mendon changed color; he replied: 
                
               "Even in that contingency it may become my duty to protect her, and bestow upon her my name." 
               "You speak in riddles, my son." 
               "Yet it is a riddle which time will solve, Father. When the right time comes, you shall hear a singular piece of family history-I do not exactly know all its details myself, but I shall before long, and then I will enlighten you." 
               "I can wait on your pleasure-in the meatime I must be lenient towards this young lady. Such is your will for the present?" 
               "Exactly-for the present. Should future events show that Adrienne Durand is not the legal heiress, you may claim her as a fugitive nun, and cause her to be taken back to her convent." 
               A faint sneer quivered on the lip of the listener, and he said: 
               "How devotedly you must love her, my son. Ah, well, I can rest satisfied with this assurance, for I know it gives me unlimited power over the future fate of this courageous stranger." 
               "I do not understand you, Father." 
               "It matters not-but an idea occurs to me: in aiding you to marry the heiress to M. Lecour's fortune, I deprive my church of her wealth-she has from her birth been destined to the cloister, and of course her fortune must fall to the house in which she takes the vail." 
               "I have thought of that, and it is my intention to devote one-third of the estate to the service of the church-that is far more than the old curmudgeon, her grandfather, will ever give her if he is permitted to make a will." 
               The emphasis on the last words was so marked that the priest looked up, caught the eye fixed penetratingly upon him, and as if the thought which dictated them was read in that glance, he said, in a suppressed tone: 
                
               "Why should an old imbecile like him be considered capable of making one? Go on, my son; unvail your purpose more fully. If M. Lecour is prevented from executing a will, and this young lady turns out not to be his descendant, what then?" 
               "If she is not the veritable Mademoiselle Durand, then she is the--But no; I cannot reveal that now; it is too uncertain. Understand me, Father, I do not say that no will is to be forthcoming. On the contrary, when this old man dies, there must be one which will give his reputed grand-child possession of the estate, whether she holds that relation to him or not." 
               "Then it is your intention to marry her immediately?" drily questioned the priest. 
               "By no means. I must win her first, and my efforts to that end will depend on the prospect she has of inheriting this large estate. I offer you a magnificent bribe to aid me, for the accumulations alone of M. Lecour must be enormous." 
               "You reckon on my devotion to your interests to a great extent, my son." 
               M. Mendon's lip haugthily curled. 
               "I merely appeal to your own interests, Father Eustace. They will be best consulted by aiding me in the attainment of my purpose." 
               "And have you no scruples of conscience at wresting the bride of Heaven almost from the altar, and inducing her to utter the profane vows of devotion to an earthly lover?" And are you aware, my son, that you are proposing a forgery to me, an anointed son of the church?" asked Father Eustace, in his softest tone, but with a look of severity which alarmed M. Mendon for the success of his scheme. 
               At that crisis the servant, who had been commanded to follow them with the horse, overtook the two, and the inscrutable scrutable priest mounted the animal, bowed calmly, and rode away without further committing himself. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
               A PLEDGE EXACTED THAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO FULFIL. 
               ON the morning following that night of anguish, when Eady entered the apartment of her master, she found him suffering severely both in body and mind. His voice was feeble and his manner wild, as he started up and said: 
               "Who is that? What do you want?" 
               "Hi! it's only me, marster, an' I comes in every day, I's sure, widout your gittin' so flustered like." 
               M. Lecour' s head sunk back, and with a shudder, he said: 
               "Oh, Eady, the White Terror came to me again last night-she was in this room. She shrieked aloud, and aroused me from my sleep." 
               The negress listened incredulously. 
               "It's jes a figmy of yer own brains. I've bin 'bout dis house at all hours o' de night, an' I've never yet hearn anything dat was uncountable to me. Sometimes I chooses to scare ole Pierre by makin' b'lieve dat I's seen a ghose, but I hasn't never seen one yit, and I don't b'lieve dat I eber shall." 
               "But I tell you I saw her with my own eyes-I heard her piercing cry. I believe it would have aroused me from a death trance. Oh! it is a fearful-fearful visitation." 
               He covered his eyes, as if by so doing he could conceal from his mental vision the image that arose before it, but Eady regarded him with an expression of contemptuous pity as she occupied herself with setting the room in order. M. Lecour presently aroused himself, and asked: 
               "Is not this the day for the monthly visit of Father Eustace? I trust he will not fail to come, for after this fearful vision I need his presence." 
               "An much good'll he do you," muttered Eady; for my part, I hope he won't come, caze he allers puts you up to some new deviltry every time he does come. I think Satan's 'nuff to give you counsel without his help." 
               A sudden recollection seemed to strike M. Lecour, and his sallow face flushed as he said: 
               "In spite of my command to the contrary, that girl came to my room last night. I am sure I had a distinct view of her person, standing just within the doorway when, the phantom roused me from my sleep. Ask her if she too did not see it, and when her account corroborates mine, perhaps you will attach credit to the actual appearance of this visitation." 
               At this assertion, Eady appeared to become alarmed: She dropped her dusting cloth and trembled all over, as she deprecatingly said: 
               "Oh marster, don' make a dream de cause o' blame to a young gal what seems to have no harm in her. Mam'selle Adrienne were shet up in her own room, an' I's sure she neber were here no more'n de ghose was." 
               "I tell you they were both here, and I'll get the truth out of her about it. Go and command her to come hither at once." 
               Eady seemed to hesitate as to the propriety of obedience, and M. Lecour arose with a menacing air. She instantly hurried from the room and knocked for admittance on Adrienne's door. No answer came, and after a moment's pause, she turned the bolt and entered. 
               The young stranger was still in bed, and Eady drew aside the curtains and looked down upon her. Pale and still, she lay in a species of trance from which Eady found it difficult to arouse her for several moments. Alarmed as she was, the woman dared not cry out, and bring M. Lecour to her side, for she did not know what revelation might burst from those pale lips in the first moment of consciousness. 
               Eady raised the nerveless hands, and chafed them in her own, and the electric thrill thus imparted to the frame of Adrienne seemed gradually to spread through the stagnant blood, and arouse her to a perception of what was passing around her. She shivered, unclosed her eyes, and feebly said: 
               "Thank Heaven! it is day again! and she is not near me." 
               Eady's eyes grew larger, and a dusky circle gathered around her lips, as she listened-she faltered: 
               "Who is it, chile? Don't say as you've seen anything too, caze I don' want ter grow wile dis mornin'." 
               Adrienne's senses were now completely aroused, and she sat up in the bed and peered curiously around the room. She muttered: 
               "Everything is just as they were last night. Eady, have you the key of that cabinet safe in your possession?" 
               "Surely, an' here it is," was the triumphant response, as she drew forth the key and held it up. Nobody can git dis from me, I reckon, either by night or day." 
               "Yet that cabinet was certainly opened last night; the dresses and jewels you showed to me yesterday, were assumed by a tall pale woman who stood in front of that mirror, and put them all on in turn. I saw her confusedly, as one in a half-dreaming state, but she was there. When she put on the last dress, I am certain she went in my grandfather's room, and aroused him by a most unearthly cry." 
                
               Eady wrung her hands in anguish as she listened to this statement, and muttered: 
               "Oh Lor'! oh Lor'! what shall I do? what shall I do, now?" 
               Adrienne regarded her with astonishment, and suddenly asked: 
               "What is the matter? Why are you so much distressed?" 
               "I's boun' to be 'stressed, caze you'll 'firm de marster dat dis house is haunted by a woman in his bride's dress. Las' nite was de reg'lar time for her to come to him and' he's bin goin' on in 'tother room 'bout her screechin' at him, and scarin' out o' him de little sense he had lef'. Ef you tells de same tale, dere won't be no livin' in dis place no more for us." 
               "So much the better, for it is a dreary old house, and we would all be better in any other. I shall certainly tell M. Lecour what I have seen, if it will bring about so desirable a result." 
               At this announcement the negress seemed overwhelmed with distress. She earnestly said: 
               "We's boun' to stay here, young mistis. Dere's nothin' else left us, an' you don' know what you're doin' when you let on dat you seen de White Terror las' nite. Was you wide awake when she come, or was you dreamin'? Think, now, an' don't mix up things." 
               Adrienne tried to recall the impressions of the preceding night, and, vivid as they had been, her own convictions of their reality began to waver. She could not assert that she was thoroughly awake. She seemed to have lain in a half slumber, from which she had not been able completely to arouse herself while the phantom remained in her room. That she had glided out after her, she was vaguely conscious, but not with the clear perception of a waking vision. After all, it might only have been a vivid dream, and deep as was the impression it had made upon her, she could not positively assert that the phantom shape had not been the offspring of her own perturbed mind. The anguish of the old woman affected her strangely, and with some hesitation she said: 
               "It may have been only a dream, Eady, though it seemed very like reality. I have less confidence in my own judgment, as I have been a victim to somnambulism for several years, and strange fancies have at times possessed me." 
               "Dat's it, honey. I don' know what dat long word means, but I s'pose it's somethin' what make you think you's seen what you hasn't really seen." 
               "But if M. Lecour saw it too, there must be some reality in the appearance." 
               "Oh chile, he carn't be trusted; he's as mad as he can be, an' ef you 'grees dat you saw de White Terror las' nite, I won't answer for de consequins. You mustn't 'low dat you saw it, nohow." 
               The intense solicitude of the negress suggested a new idea to Adrienne, and she regarded her steadily as she said: 
               "You have a secret which is important to you that you conceal from the old man in the opposite room. You may impose on him, because he is superstitious; but it is hopeless for you to succeed in any such attempt with me. Convince me of the necessity of this concealment, and I will promise not to betray to him what I now believe I actually saw last night." 
               These words seemed to reduce Eady to the extremity of terror. She bent forward with clasped hands, and hoarsely whispered: 
               "It is a life resk ef you speak de whole trufe. A life resk, young mistis; caze he'll no more mind killin' us all, den he'd mind wringin' de necks off so many chickens ef dey was in his way. I darsn't tell you de horrid trufe 'bout dis ole house, hut it's a cursed place for de evil deeds dat has happened in its walls. You'd better ha' died afore you put yer foot inter it, ef yer gwine to back de marster in his frenzies, for sich evil 'll come of it, dat you'll wish you had never bin born to bring it about. I 'plores you, young mistis, to 'fuse all mention o' de strange dream you had las' nite, as you hopes for de blessin' o' God in dis life, an' happiness in de one to come." 
               As she concluded, Eady threw herself in an attitude of supplication before the excited girl, and, alarmed by her words, as well as moved by her entreaties, Adrienne said: 
               "If such dire consequences are to ensue, I cannot persist in asserting the reality of the scene I beheld last night. I will not speak of what I saw to M. Lecour, yet if he questions me, how am I to evade him without uttering a falsehood?" 
               "Oh, you has only to do as I does. Treat de whole story as ef 'twas a strange notion o' his own, what has no foundation in reality. Ef you doesn't, wuss things den you think on 'll be sure to happen." 
               Deeply impressed by the manner of the old woman, Adrienne finally assented to this proposal, but it was with a deepening conviction of the reality of the scene she had witnessed on the previous night, and with the resolute determination to fathom the mystery of the White Terror which thus haunted her grandfather. 
               She dismissed Eady with such assurances as calmed her fears for the present, and then arose to make her toilette for the day. The long shining hair was unrolled, and carefully brushed, before being folded around her gracefully moulded head, which it crowned like a coronal of burnished gold. It formed her only adornment, save her quiet, girlish beauty, for the close black robe she habitually wore differed but little from the unbecoming dress of the sisterhood among whom she had been reared. 
               By the time she was dressed, Eady came in with her breakfast, and exhorted her to be calm and firm when M. Lecour questioned her concerning the incidents of the previous night. Adrienne had scarcely time to swallow her cup of coffee, and a few morsels of biscuit, when the voice of M. Lecour was heard in a towering passion, calling out from his door: 
               "Girl, am I to wait all day, while you put on your rags? Come to me, I command you, without further delay." 
               Adrienne grew very pale; she said: 
               "I must go to him, or he may come in here." 
               "No fear o' dat, chile; you's safe 'nuff here from any 'trusion from him. De air o' dis here 'partmen' don't 'gree wi' his health." 
               "Why not? You always seem to speak in riddles, Eady." 
               She mysteriously replied: 
               "Dis were de madame's room, an' dere is good reasons why he won't come in it ef he can help it, but I darsn't tell 'em. Dare! jes' hear dat ole sinner, how he's rampin' an' ragin' up an' down his room. You'd better go, but don' you let him run over you; ef you does, you won't be able to stay in dis house another day, I can tell you." 
               Thus warned, with extreme trepidation Adrienne unclosed the door, and proceeded toward the opposite tower. The cadaverous face of M. Lecour glared on her as she stood in the doorway, and he scanned her from head to foot before he said: 
               "So-o, you've come at last! One would have thought, from the time you have taken, that all the fooleries of a Parisian toilette were to be assumed before you could make your appearance; after all, you come before me clad like a crow, with a red topknot newly dressed. Girl, that hair never belonged to me or mine, and it displeases me to see its color on your head." 
               "Yet it is nature's bounteous covering, mon pre, and I am not accountable for its peculiar shade," was the reply, uttered with an apparent disregard of his wrathful mood which surprised him. He drew near her, peered into the deep crystalline orbs, which seemed as wells of tenderness and truth, and then savagely said: 
               "I really don't believe you are the least afraid of me." 
               Though internally trembling, Adrienne remembered the words of Eady, and calmly replied: 
               "Why should I fear you, mon pre?" 
               "We won't discuss that question now; I have something of more importance to inquire about. I wish you to state to me concisely and truly what you saw and heard last night that was unusual. Eady has doubtless told you of the-the singular visitation I have received." 
               "I had a strange dream, Monsieur; but I am not certain that I saw anything which cannot be accounted for on rational grounds." 
               "Phoo! nonsense! speak to the point, and tell me what you actually saw." 
               "In my dream, mon pre?" 
               "No," he thundered. "Tell me what you saw with your natural eyes, for I saw you standing in the doorway while that-that thing was here, ringing its; eldrich screeches in my ears. Speak the truth upon your soul; did you not see a woman, clad in bridal garments, come into this room last night? Did you not follow her, and witness what took place in my apartment?" 
               Adrienne assumed a bewildered expression as she slowly said: 
                
               "That apparition was no portion of the dream to which I have referred. If you desire to hear that, I will relate it to you." 
               "Girl, you evade me! You do not give a straightforward answer as I require. You are in league with this wretched old blackamoor to deceive me." 
               "It would be very singular, mon pre, if I should cross the ocean to live with you, and join with your servant in a conspiracy against you in less than twenty-four hours after my arrival beneath your roof. If I did not behold the phantom bride, how shall I acknowledge it at your request?" 
               He gazed searchingly and sternly upon her, as he slowly replied: 
               "You are all alike, from the queen upon her throne to the black cook in the kitchen: all full of deceit, and treachery, and guile. You stood in that doorway last night; I am sure of it, yet you wish to convince me that you saw nothing of the pale bride." 
               "Monsieur, you are already aware that I am a somnambulist My body is often found in places of which my dormant senses take no cognizance. If my mind had been in a condition to judge of the consequences likely to ensue, do you not think that your commands, and Eady's warnings, would have prevented me from intruding here?" 
               "And you really did not see it?" exclaimed M. Lecour, in a sort of despair. "Am I indeed the only wretch about this house to whom this apparition is visible? Can the voice which rings so shrilly in my ears, be but a creation of my own fantasy? Accursed! oh, accursed, whither can I flee to escape the avenging hand of God!" 
               He traversed the floor in an agony of anger and fear. Adrienne would have left the room, but he motioned to her to remain, and she sat down near one of the windows. 
                
               At length, wearied with the rapidity of his own motions, and the feverish anguish that preyed upon his spirit, M. Lecour threw himself upon his sofa, and covered his face with his folded arms. The interval of silence which followed lasted so long that it became oppressive to Adrienne, and she would gladly have escaped from the apartment if she had dared to leave it without his permission. At length he seemed to remember her presence, and looking up, he harshly said: 
               "Since you are here, you may as well make yourself of some use. My eyes are not as strong as they were, and you may read aloud to me." 
               "With pleasure, mon pre; what shall I select?" and Adrienne arose with alacrity, and approached the bookcase. 
               A wild laugh burst from M. Lecour, and he tauntingly replied: 
               "You can find nothing to read to me which would not shock the pious abbess to see in your hands. The best infidel writers are on those shelves. You will find Voltaire, D'Holbach, Helvetius and Volney; day by day shall you come to me, till you have imbued your soul with their sparkling sophistry, and learned that there are two sides to every question; even to that of the immortality of the soul, which you have been taught to believe a fixed fact." 
               "And as such I must ever regard it, Monsieur," was the grave response. "I may read those works to you, but they can never shake the conviction that the spirit within me is indestructible-I feel it-I know it, by a power of intuition implanted in every soul that lives." 
               "Why then should mine repudiate it?" he muttered. "Read-read, child; those books will not hurt you; they will only give a keener edge to your natural proclivities. Ha! you seem pleased with the opportunity to dive into the writings of this sneering, unbelieving Frenchman," and he pointed with sarcastic scorn to the volume of Voltaire she had already taken down. 
               "I am glad of the permission to examine works which have long excited my curiosity. I am not afraid of the effect they may have on my mind, for it is a poor faith in the great God which can be shaken by the infidel writings of any man, however brilliant may have been the misguided intellect which dictated them." 
               "Well expressed, by all the false gods of heathendom! but we shall see what your faith is really based on before you are done with the course of reading I shall carry you through. I have spent years of my life in trying to convince myself that the whole religious fabric is the offspring of man's invention. I cannot say that I have entirely succeeded, for I still actually receive a confessor once a month." 
               Adrienne seemed so much shocked, that M. Lecour laughed with scornful glee as he pointed to her book: 
               "To work-to work, child. I do not argue with such fledgelings as you. When you have read all my books on this subject, we may return to it again. Then your impressions may be radically changed." 
               In a discussion of this kind, Adrienne felt her inability to cope with him, and she preferred waiving it. To touch his heart, revive his deadened sensibilities to the good and true, was her only aim; and she felt that it would be defeated at the outset by embarking with him in profitless theological discussions. She would begin by reading to him such books as he recommended, but she would gradually induce him to listen to something higher and more ennobling than the most brilliant products of the scoffer's pen. 
               She had, however, scarcely commenced her task, when M. Lecour abruptly said: 
                
               "Put by the book, and talk to me. I am curious to discover what inspired you with such repugnance to the life of a religieuse. Until your last letter came to me, the Superior led me to suppose that you willingly accepted the destiny I had awarded to you." 
               A faint color flashed over the transparent cheek of the young girl, and after a painful pause, she replied: 
               "Certain things occurred which rendered it impossible to remain without the loss of all self-respect." 
               "So you preferred risking the loss of your bread and butter to the sacrifice of such a myth as that! Self-respect! stuff! As if any one has such a sentiment for the miserable mass of selfishness and folly of which human nature is composed." 
               "Every human being into whom the great Jehovah has breathed a spark of his divinity, must cherish such a feeling. Without it, we are of less value than the dead leaf that flutters in the blast of autumn. I am afraid you will never understand me, mon pre; the scoffer and the earnest soul can find no common point of union; yet I should have been glad to claim some affinity of spirit with the only human being known to me to whom I am united by ties of blood." 
               M. Lecour laughed more discordantly than ever; he mockingly repeated: 
               "Affinity of spirit! Don't use sentimental jargon in talking with me, Adrienne; it only arouses my cynical feelings. I am a hoary ruin on whose channelled front flowers would be singularly out of place. Do not hope to cozen me by well placed words, into believing anything that is noble, elevated, or true, of that mean thing, human nature. I have tried it in others, in myself, and always with the same result. No; man sprang from the earth, is of the 'earth earthy,' and unto her bosom shall he return after he has played his little play out." 
                
               "Yet the evil or the good which he has accomplished shall live as a heritage of curses or of blessings to those who shall come after him," said the soft, sweet voice which already began to wind itself about this isolated wreck, and make him feel that a ray of something softer and brighter than it had long known, had shone upon his darkened existence, affording a glimpse of that good which he had so long and sedulously shut out from both soul and life. 
               M. Lecour threw himself back upon his sofa, again closed his eyes, and said: 
               "Take a book and read to me what you choose. I shall soon sleep, for the sound of your voice has a lulling effect upon my nerves." 
               Literally obeying his command to read what she liked, Adrienne laid aside the volume of Voltaire, and drew from her pocket a small Bible. She read from the Psalms, and after a quick convulsive movement, and a bitter smile, his features collapsed into their usual pallid fixedness, and he seemed to listen with quiet indifference to the words that flowed from her lips. In a few moments he slept, for the excitement of the previous night had quite exhausted him. Adrienne closed her book with a brief prayer for strength and guidance in the difficult position in which she had found herself placed, and assuring herself that the slumber of the old man was not feigned, she arose and softly glided from the apartment. As she passed the easel with its concealed picture, the temptation assailed her to lift the drapery and look upon the work so jealously guarded from inspection. 
               She put forth her hand, but a glance toward the sleeping man showed her that his features were disturbed, and his lips moving, as if the dormant, spirit was cognizant of her wilful act, and struggled to bid her forbear. She drew back in affright and hurriedly passed out. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER X. 
               FATHER EUSTACE MAKES A STRANGE REVELATION. 
               ADRIENNE stood upon the gallery a few moments, enjoying the gleams of bright sunshine that found their way through the crowding branches of the trees. She pulled from one of them a long spray of the gray Spanish moss which so gracefully drapes a Southern forest. After examining the frail texture of the plant, with its slender, pliant stems, and delicate frost-work, like a sprinkling of fine hair powder, to which it owes its peculiar shade of gray, the young girl wove its tendrils into a wreath, and wound it in a picturesque fashion around her head. 
               Resolute to take a survey of the premises alone, and see what discoveries she might make, Adrienne descended the staircase leading to the lower gallery, and passed into the yard. Orange trees clustered around the broad steps which led to the gravel walk, and she plucked from them a bouquet of fragrant blossoms, the perfume of which she inhaled with exquisite pleasure, for every nerve of her sensitive frame was alive to the natural sources of enjoyment so lavishly scattered around us. 
               The birds sang undisturbed among the trees, and as Adrienne listened to their glad carols, her own soul caught from them a new impulse, and her voice burst forth in song so full of soul music, that the feathered warblers hushed their strains to hearken to the melody. 
               In spite of the uncertainty of her position, and the hard future that might lie before her, the escaped novice felt a sense of freedom and enjoyment which impelled her to sing. She slowly traversed the carriage drive, and discovered amid the rank weeds the remains of a rustic fountain in the centre tre of what had, in days long past, been a carefully kept lawn. The basin was empty, the resevoir which had once supplied its tiny jet of water, long since dry, and with a vague feeling of oppression, she stooped and lifted the broken leaf of a marble water lily, through which the stream had once murmured, while mirth and revelry filled the house now so dreary and deserted. 
               As she lifted her head, a voice spoke suddenly beside her. 
               "I thought the worship of the Druids had long since passed from the earth, but I now surely see before me one of its crowned priestesses, bending above the shrine at which she once worshipped." 
               An expression of doubt and incredulity came into the young stranger's face, and every drop of blood receded from it, leaving her nearly as white as the marble lilies over which she had lately bent. She looked quickly around, and the pale lips unclosed to exclaim: 
               "Whose voice was that? You here, Father Eustace? Who would have expected to find you in this out-of-the-way place?" 
               The priest, for he it was, surveyed her with an expression of severity as he said: 
               "As little could I have expected to find the child dedicated from her birth to the service of Heaven, in such guise as this, roaming alone through this tangled woodland. Adrienne Durand, how have you come hither, and why are you wearing that secular dress? Do not confirm what it suggests, that you have abandoned the calling which would have ennobled you on earth, and in Heaven would have given you a bright place among the celestial choirs that forever chant the praises of the Most High. Wilful girl, what have you done?" 
               While he thus spoke, Adrienne's self-command returned to her, and the color again crimsoned her cheek as she replied plied, with an expression of quiet dignity that filled the priest with amazement: 
               "Surely, Father Eustace, the training you would have given me did not tend to such a consummation as that. I have come hither to find earthly duties which have already been too long neglected. I have abjured the calling of a religieuse, and henceforth I intend to play my part in the world, which belongs as much to God as do the convent halls." 
               "Poor, simple child! I understand your allusion, and you refused to use a gift manifestly bestowed for that purpose, in the service of the church, because you, forsooth, thought it wrong! The presumption of youth is amazing! But this is no time to deal with you on that score. Tell me how you came hither, and what is your purpose in crossing the ocean to dwell in yonder ruin, long since given up to the rats, and its demented master?" 
               "I beg that you will refer more respectfully to M. Lecour, for I am his grandchild, and henceforth the companion of his declining years. I have relinquished all idea of assuming the vail, and I am resolved to devote my life to him. He is my only relative, and I consider it my first duty to become the companion of his solitude, to restore to him the child he has lost, and endeavor to brighten the remaining days of his existence." 
               While she thus spoke, Father Eustace kept his eyes fixed upon her varying countenance, and many contending feelings were visible upon his own dark face. He abruptly said: 
               "You have come hither, I suppose, to set forth your claims upon this old miser's wealth, for with nothing less at stake would any young girl bury herself in such a place as this, with such a man as M. Lecour." 
               Adrienne quickly replied: 
                
               "I have avowed to you the intention with which I came hither. I rebelled against the confinement of the convent, and I sought a home and protection from my natural guardian, without any schemes with reference to his wealth. I hoped that I might win for myself a place in his heart, that my love for him might throw a brief gleam of sunshine upon the hoary head rapidly bowing toward the tomb." 
               "And now you have seen this venerable relation, what is your opinion as to your probable success?" asked the priest, with a sneer he took no pains to conceal. 
               "My path may be difficult, but I have not despaired of winning a place in the regard of M. Leeour," was the evasive reply. 
               "Truly you must be sanguine, Mademoiselle, for a more unredeemed old sinner it has never been my lot to confess. If facts did not prove the contrary, I should say that his first impulse would have been to turn you from his door, when you asked for shelter beneath his roof." 
               Adrienne shrank from his searching glance, for she remembered that such had nearly been her fate on her arrival, and she waived the subject by saying: 
               "If you are surprised to find me here, Father Eustace, I am not less so to meet with you in this new world. The Superior told us you had gone on a mission, but she did not reveal whither you had been sent." 
               He drily responded: 
               "I was sent hither for a purpose of great political importance, and, strange as it may seem to you, your presence here can materially aid me in attaining success, Be obedient and docile, and I will withhold from the bishop of this diocese the knowledge of your evasion. If your presence is once made known to him, he can stretch out the arm of ecclesiastical authority, and lay its strong hand upon you, even here." 
                
               Adrienne trembled and grew pale. She asked: 
               "In what manner can I aid you, father? Alas! I hoped in these wilds to be free as the air of Heaven-to be able to walk untrammeled upon my path of life." 
               "Do my bidding, and you may do so, for me. I will pledge myself not to interfere with the happy lot you seem to have chosen." 
               "What, then, is your bidding?" 
               Father Eustace had hitherto remained in his saddle, but at this point in their colloquy he dismounted, fastened the bridle of his horse carefully to a neighboring bough, and stood beside the young girl. He lowered his voice as he said: 
               "Swear to me, Mademoiselle, that you will not betray to any human being what I am about to confide to you. It is a secret of vast importance." 
               "I can only pledge you my word, father, and there is no one here to whom I should be likely to reveal your confidence." 
               "True, and I believe I may trust you. Learn, then, that in this ruinous house a state prisoner is believed to be detained. I have been sent hither to ascertain the truth of this supposition: I claim your aid, and if it is successfully given, I will obtain from the bishop such a permit for you to follow your own will, as must entitle you to perfect freedom of action so far as conventual life is concerned." 
               Adrienne listened in great surprise. 
               "A state prisoner here, father? It seems impossible." 
               "Yet I have every reason to believe it to be true. M. Lecour has played a conspicuous part in the world, and circumstances have thrown into his power a most important personage. I enjoin you to watch till you have discovered the room in which this individual is concealed, and inform me of it immediately." 
                
               "And do you require me to become a spy upon my grandfather?" she asked, with indignant surprise. "Excuse me, father, I cannot play so treacherous a part. He has received me in good faith, and I will be true to him." 
               Father Eustace regarded her severely. He said: 
               "You are a silly child, and have crude ideas on most subjects. Your duty to your grandfather is inferior to that you owe to me." 
               "I do not understand you," she faltered. 
               "Your conscience must be very delicate, truly. Since I can deal with you in no other way, I must inform you of the actual tie that exists between us. Do you remember the deep interest I have always manifested in you? the free access I have always had to you, even in your convent?" 
               She faintly responded: 
               "I do; but to what does all this tend?" 
               "Only to the announcement you feel is coming, and from which I can see that you recoil. Know, then, that I am also connected with the old recluse who lives in yonder tower-that I wedded his only daughter without his consent, and you-" 
               He paused, regarded her fixedly, and Adrienne impulsively said: 
               "And I am the child of that marriage? Yet why, why does my heart refuse to ratify this relationship? Why have I been taught to regard you as a stranger, if you are indeed my father?" 
               "Because I have long since repudiated all earthly ties. I do not ask from you the love of a child-I only demand the obedience due to a father. Now, Mademoiselle, will you refuse to aid me in the enterprise I have undertaken?" 
               Adrienne was too much bewildered to reply immediately-past memories came rushing upon her in a confused crowd, and she endeavored to recall some incident which could have led her to surmise the actual relationship in which the priest asserted her to stand toward himself. She slowly said: 
               "Tell me-tell me how this can be. Tell me of my mother-my dead mother." 
               "It is a dreary tale, child, and one I do not care to dwell on. Our marriage was clandestine: her father hated me, unknown as I was to him, because a deadly feud had existed between his family and mine for several generations. I loved Estelle Lecour with all the power of my soul-she died, and left me desolate. I placed her infant child in the convent to be educated, and assumed the vows myself that I might watch unceasingly over her. Have I not done so, Mademoiselle, until duty sent me on this errand? to accomplish which, I demand your assistance as my right. Refuse me at your peril?" 
               "Is this the way in which a daughter should be claimed?" asked Adrienne, tremulously. "No token of a father's love have I ever received from you, and now, you close this revelation with a threat." 
               "And one I shall certainly fulfill," he coldly responded. "Obey my commands, and I release you from you early destination-I permit you to gain a foothold in this old man's house, that you may make sure of inheriting his wealth. Is not that a sufficient bribe?" 
               "And what use will you make of your information, if I succeed in gaining it?" 
               "Nothing that is detrimental to M. Lecour shall be done. I merely wish to remove from his power one of whom he may be tempted to make an unprincipled use. That person also shall have a safe and permanent asylum for the future. I pledge my word that no injury shall be done to any party concerned, but a great political wrong prevented. Speak, will you aid me?" 
                
               "Alas! I have no alternative," was the submissive reply. 
               Poor Adrienne felt as if a net had suddenly closed around her from which it was impossible to escape. The passionless manner in which this man had revealed the tie that existed between them, failed to impress her with the idea that he could really be her father-yet how could she disprove his assertion, or escape from the necessity of obedience to his commands? Her position was difficult enough before, but this added to her perplexities. Never doubting what her decision must be, Father Eustace said: 
               "This is M. Lecour's usual day for confession-I must seek him now, but I will meet you on this spot four days hence to learn what progress you have made in your discoveries." 
               "I left him sleeping-had you not better refrain from disturbing him?" 
               "I must see him this morning. He only receives me at stated intervals, and if I fail to visit him to-day, he would refuse me admittance for another month. I shall not fail to meet you at the time and place appointed, and when you remember how much is at stake for yourself, I scarcely think you will dare to play me false. Au revoir." 
               Adrienne watched his receding figure like one in a dream. How singular it seemed that she should find in this secluded spot the father confessor who had so suddenly disappeared from her convent several months before her own departure. She remembered the conjectures that had followed his disappearance, and the profound silence maintained as to the cause which removed him was now partly explained-a political errand, involving the fate of an important personage. Here was food for her imagination; was this old ruin the abode of more than one mystery? or was the phantom bride the person of whom the priest was in pursuit? Could M. Lecour's terror have been consummate acting, for the purpose of misleading her? And, above all, could the priest really be her own father? She shuddered at the thought, for she had good cause to remember Father Eustace; and her heart sank within her at finding him upon her path in her new home; armed, too, with parental, as well as ecclesiastical authority over her defenceless self. 
               It was strange that her heart should so utterly repudiate this newly discovered tie. She found no spring of tenderness in her nature for the father who had known her from infancy, and yet had never betrayed the bond that bound them together, till his own interests demanded its acknowledgment. The stern, cold manner with which the announcement was made, caused her to recoil from admitting its truth. If she were really the child of this man, why had he so long kept her in ignorance of their true relationship? During all the years of her childhood he could have revealed himself to her in his real character with perfect impunity, for the abbess was his cousin, and, she knew, must be in possession of his confidence. 
               A new motive was given for the quest she had undertaken, but Adrienne sang no more that morning, as she walked on, in a most despondent mood, to find the rear entrance to the chateau. She felt as if she could not live in this house another day, without fathoming the weird mystery which enveloped it; but if discovered, dared she reveal its secrets to her new tyrant? Should the stern old man discover that she had violated her oath, might not swift and sudden vengeance overtake her from his unscrupulous hands? She shuddered as a glimpse of the danger of her position flashed upon her, but it was now too late to retract. She comprehended too well the iron nature of Father Eustace, to attempt to deceive him. She must serve him, or be torn from the asylum she had gained with such effort, and given back to the fate her whole nature recoiled from. 
               Absorbed in thought, her steps insensibly slackened, and she at length sat down on a fallen tree to await the reappearance of Father Eustace. He must tell her more before she could be satisfied that she was really his child. An hour passed away, and the sound of approaching steps startled her; she looked up and saw Father Eustace leading his horse toward her, and his face looked sombre and disappointed. As his eyes fell upon her he paused, and said: 
               "I am glad to find you on my path again; I am convinced of the truth of my suspicions, though I could gain no clue from my penitent-ugh! a most intractable old creature he is, I must say. From you I must learn the locality in which his prisoner is concealed, that I may safely carry on my plan for his removal." 
               "His removal! It is not a woman, then?" 
               "No-why should you have imagined such a thing? Oh, I comprehend-you have heard of the White Terror, as old Lecour calls her, and fancied she might be the object of my quest. No-mine is a flesh and blood reality, and no phantom." 
               "Do you give credence to the appearance of the phantom?" asked the young girl, with solicitude. 
               "Why not? I believe such things can be-and the crimes of this old man entitle him to the visitation, if those of any creature ever did." 
               "Father Eustace, how is it that M. Lecour receives his son-in-law without being aware of the tie existing between you and himself?" 
               "We never met till I came hither. The hatred he bore my father, was transferred to me, and the curse that broke his daughter's heart was hurled upon her because she wedded one of ray detested name. It is strange to me that he would receive you at all-some motive must lie under his apparent kindness. But now you are here, make yourself useful to me, and make sure of the old man's fortune." 
               Adrienne flushed deeply, and tears sprang into her eyes, as she earnestly asked: 
               "Are you really and truly my father?" 
               "As certainly as your name is Adrienne Durand am I Julien Durand, the former husband of M. Lecour's daughter, and consequently the father of her child. I can bring you proofs of my identity which you cannot question, if you insist upon my doing so." 
               She slowly shook her head. 
               "No-no-I will not demand that; a daughter of the church has no right to question the solemn asseveration of her spiritual as well as her earthly father." 
               "It is well that you are at last convinced. But I warn you that M. Lecour must have no suspicion of my identity. It would blow my plans to the winds, and at once place him on his guard." 
               "And if he should suspect me, what then?" 
               "I will care for your safety. You shall not be left to his mercy, if you are compelled to compromise yourself in any way by serving me. Adieu-I must not linger any longer-four days hence I will meet you beside the fountain." 
               Compelled to be satisfied with this assurance, Adrienne walked slowly toward the house, deeply meditating on the strange event of the morning. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XI. 
               THE MYSTERIOUS GUEST. 
               AS Father Eustace approached the apartment of M. Lecour he stepped very lightly, and when he gained the door he paused and listened intently. No sound save the deep breathing of the sleeper came from within, and with velvet tread he glided through the entrance and looked upon the scene the room presented. 
               A packet of open letters lay upon the table; and without scruple, the inquisitor glanced rapidly over their contents. His flashing eyes, quivering lips, and excited expression, showed that he was strongly moved by their revelations. 
               Bitter and scornful was the expression with which he approached the sleeping man, and looked down upon his corrugated brow and laboring breast; for M. Lecour exhibited all the painful contortions of a man suffering intensely from nightmare. 
               "Even in sleep the wretch is haunted by the memory of his crimes," was the thought that passed through the mind of the visitor. "I have not been able to penetrate to the depths of his seared soul yet. There is something kept back which I must fathom, beside the hiding-place of my quarry. Then I will lay my hand upon him and crush him, or strip him of all his ill-gotten gains." 
               With a gesture illustrative of the thought, Father Eustace thrust forth his long, nervous-looking hand above the prostrate sleeper, and Lecour started from his slumbers just in time to come in collision with it. The sudden shock effectually awoke him, and his first impulse was to hurl forth a volley of curses and abuse which would have made any other man quail; but the priest stood his ground firmly and calmly. He quietly said: 
                
               "My son, I came hither on my usual errand, but me-thinks this is a singular reception. What does it mean? Your mind seems in no proper condition for the confession of sin, and the remission thereof." 
               The even tones of his voice exerted a marked power over the listener. He paused in his blasphemous career, struggled to recover outward composure, and finally said: 
               "Pardon me, father; I did not at first recognize you. I have suffered much within the last few hours, and am in no condition to bear intrusion. Why have you entered without being announced? You have never done so before, and my servants are very negligent to permit you to do so now." 
               Lecour glanced suspiciously toward the table as he thus spoke, and while his visitor offered his explanations he removed the letters which had already undergone inspection, and placed them in a place of safety. The priest furtively smiled, as he said: 
               "I never before found your door open to admit me; but to-day it was unclosed and the way lay before me. I knew you would be expecting me, and I came up without ceremony. A new era seems indeed to have dawned on Bellair, for as I came across the lawn I saw the flutter of a woman's garments, and heard the carol of a girl's voice. What may these portend, my friend?" 
               "Nothing that need concern you, sir priest. You came hither to hear my confession; hearken to it, take your usual dole, and leave me for another month to my solitude and my wretchedness." 
               "Nay-not so," said the priest, sternly. "This day has brought with it a crisis in our intercourse, and I insist that all the secrets of this prison house shall be laid bare before me. Where is the hapless child you spirited away from France just as friends were gathering around him? Who
                   instigated you to remove him? and where do you keep him concealed? Inexorable as fate itself, I demand the truth, and I can find means to compel you to divulge it." 
               The marked change in his tone and manner seemed to take M. Lecour by surprise, but he soon recovered his usual iron defiance, and laughed aloud as he replied: 
               "Ha! ha! You brave the lion well in his den, but he has not yet lost all faith in the sharpness of his own teeth and claws. Why insist always on that sham? The boy is dead years ago. He was devoured by the scrofula when he passed into my keeping. I only consented to remove him, because I would not have the throne of St. Louis desecrated by a diseased idiot." 
               "What, then, is the origin of the information sent me from France that you are actually in treaty with the ambitious First Consul to deliver the boy to him, that another roi faineant may reign over the French people, while Napoleon as Mayor of the Palace, rules the nation?" 
               "Who has abused you with such fables? The son of Louis is dead, I tell you; and if he were not, no Bourbon will ever again reign in the hearts of Frenchmen-their day is past." 
               "That is not certain. If they were now as true sons of the church as in the days of St. Louis, their star might again culminate." 
               "If-yes; but infidel France would scarcely welcome even her sainted monarch back again on the same terms. No-if God really rules the earth, He will henceforth do it through purer instruments." 
               The priest interrupted him. 
               "God does rule the earth, and his church is the delegated authority upon it. Do not utter heresy in my hearing, mon ami. Let us change the subject. It seems my duty to warn you of the visible failure in your health since I last saw you. Your nervous system seems to have suffered a terrible shock, for you are tremulous as a weak woman, and there is an unsettled glimmer in your sunken eyes, that seems ominous of doom. Is it not time, brother, to think of the final arrangement of your affairs? A vast responsibility rests upon you in disposing of such an estate as yours." 
               A bitter expression swept over the sallow face of M. Lecour, and he coldly replied: 
               "The law of this colony is said to be just; why shall I not leave it to be settled with my heirs? My wealth has brought me no blessing, then why shall I desire to transfer it to another as a burden and a curse." 
               "To a man or woman perhaps it might prove such, but to an organized hierarchy to which money is power, wealth can only become the means of extended good. I speak in the name of my church, and demand of you that you shall make her your heir." 
               "What? Do you demand all, to the utter exclusion of my own blood?" 
               "Of your race there is no acknowledged scion, I believe; then why ask so irrelevant a question?" 
               M. Lecour regarded him with keen scrutiny, as he slowly asked: 
               "What has then become of the young girl who was reared in the convent to which you have told me you were confessor? Are you not aware of her history? of her claims upon me? then why should you seek to repudiate them now?" 
               "Mademoiselle Durand is already provided for as the daughter of Heaven," replied the priest with perfect self-possession. "Since you have given a bride to the church, it becomes doubly your duty to endow the sisterhood among whom she was educated, with the greater portion of your wealth." 
                
               "But if this young girl will not accept the fate I have awarded her; if she has already evaded the vigilance of the superior, has escaped, and appealed to me for protection, what then, becomes of my duty?" 
               "If it be so," was the emphatic reply, "reclaim her from the error of her ways; send her back to the holy mother, and increase the dower which shall purchase immunity for her sin." 
               M. Lecour laughed harshly. 
               "I wish you to understand that I am no longer in the humor to make the girl a nun. Now she has come to me, I think I shall retain her with me awhile." 
               "What? Is Mademoiselle Durand actually in this house? Have you really seen, and conversed with her?" 
               "Adrienne Durand is here, and I have no intention at present of forcing her to return to the captivity of her convent. Nay-I believe I will provide for her handsomely, if she continues to please me as well as she has done since her appearance beneath my roof." 
               "And have you no conscientious scruples against abetting this young rebel in her contumacy towards the church?" was the stern query of the priest. 
               "None-I can endow her nobly; she may marry well, and the descendants of even an old scape-grace like myself, may yet claim name and fame in this fair land." 
               "And have you forgotten the curse of blood that hangs over you, and yours? What of right has the regicide, the shedder of oceans of innocent blood, to hope that his descendants will claim a blessing from Heaven? No-from the hour of her birth, the doom of Adrienne was to expiate the sins of others; their taint is upon her, and she must become the sacrifice however innocent and deserving of happiness she may be in herself. Your crimes have laid this doom upon her, and you dare not put forth your hand to extricate her from it." 
                
               M. Lecour at length cowered before the cold glance, and cutting tones of his companion's voice. He felt that he uttered the truth, and all the fearful array of the past came sweeping before his mental vision. Yet he was resolute not to yield the field, and he defiantly said: 
               "Adrienne shall at least seek happiness in her own way. If the wrath of God smites her, it will not then be my fault. I can but endeavor to repair the injustice of the past. Such a man as I have been, will scarcely prove more relenting than the great Ruler of the world. You teach that His mercy endureth forever, and if that be so, why shall this blameless young girl be made the victim of my evil deeds?" 
               "Why indeed, except that it is written-'I will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children even unto the third and fourth generations.' There is no reply to that, for it is God's word, and we have both seen it fulfilled too often to doubt its truth. You will think better of this, brother, so let us proceed to fulfil the duty that brought me hither. Let the light shine in the deepest and darkest recesses of your sinful soul, that the skilfull leech may know where to apply the cure." 
               Again the mocking spirit of the penitent was arrayed against the priestly authority, but the indomitable patience and perseverence of Father Eustace finally prevailed, the intractable nature with which he had to deal, was partially subdued, and brought into a frame to utter the confession it was the object of the visit to obtain. But in one direction M. Lecour was impenetrable, the secret Father Eustace was most anxious to fathom was held too closely to permit a gleam of light to fall upon it. 
               Baffled, chagrined, and annoyed, the confessor yet gave his absolution with an expression of calm benevolence, which was intended to impose on the astute criminal, who secretly exulted in obtaining plenary forgiveness for his sins, without betraying the one that lay heaviest upon his conscience. The two parted apparently on the best of terms, though each one was silently endeavoring to circumvent the other. 
               As the priest descended the staircase, he muttered: 
               "With me that one crime outweighs all the rest, heavy as is the catalogue. If I could gain the certainty that his hand is red with his blood, I would drive home the avenging steel to his heart of hearts." 
               Moody, stern and thoughtful, he went on his way revolving plans in his mind which were singularly at variance with each other. Vengeance for kindred blood wantonly shed-the sacrifice of a youthful heart on the altar of his church; and the aggrandizement of that church through the wealth that should centre in its lawful heiress, alternately swayed him. The hopes of M. Mendon were silently ignored, or thought of only with a contemptuous curl of the lip. 
               After his last colloquy with Adrienne, Father Eustace rode away, and resuming the courage with which nature had endowed her, the young girl wiped away her tears, and strolled toward the cabin of Eady to ascertain how she was employed before she attempted to invade the tabooed portion of the house. 
               The old woman was crooning a doleful hymn while her busy hands attended to some culinary duty, and unobserved by her, Adrienne succeeded in gaining the back entrance to the house. Pierre was at work among his vegetables, but he scarcely raised his head as Adrienne passed him. Once within the door, she sped with rapid steps toward the foot of the staircase. 
               Without pausing to consider consequences, she sprang up the steps, and in another moment stood in front of the door Eady had refused to unclose on the previous day. On trying ing the lock she found it was fast, but a rapid glance around showed her a key hanging from a nail within reach of her hand. 
               With some inward tremor, Adrienne removed this, and applied it to the lock. It turned easily, and the door at once yielded to her touch. Her heart beat audibly as she stepped upon a second flight of steps, which evidently led to the highest story of the house. A few steps brought her to a small ante-chamber, in which a few boxes and old trunks were kept. These were sufficient to give some color to the assertion of Eady that it was only a lumber room, but Adrienne felt assured that the large room in the front of the house contained the mystery of which she was in pursuit. 
               Eager and excited as she had now become, the young girl paused a few moments to listen for any sounds from below which might indicate the approach of Eady, for she felt a great repugnance to the thought of being detected in the secret explorations. 
               As she thus stood, a series of sounds came from the inner room which filled her with amazement and fear. A feeble, dissonant voice was suddenly raised, and a volume of words which seemed mere senseless chatter reached her ears. 
               What discovery was she on the brink of making? Should she go on or retreat before she had forever compromised herself with her stern grandfather, by invading the mystery of his singular houshold? She felt as if it was impossible to recede now, and with desperate courage she approached the door, and placed her hand upon the bolt. Cautiously unclosing it, she opened a crevice sufficiently wide to enable her to scan the interior, and also to obtain a view of the singular occupant of the apartment. 
               The room was sumptuously fitted up, and lighted by a large widow inserted in the roof. This window had been so contrived that the projecting eaves sheltered it from observation without, while a tremulous light struggled through the yellow glass with which it was glazed, giving the effect of pale sunshine to everything it touched. 
               Immediately beneath this window was a platform raised about two feet above the floor, which was covered with rich tapestry. On this was placed a large arm-chair, on which the royal arms of France were carved, and upon the canopy above it was wrought a crown and sceptre. 
               One of the compartments of the wall was filled with a large picture representing the marriage of Louis XVI. of France to the unfortunate Marie Antoinette; and the weird fancy of the painter was shown in the filmy figures which filled up the background of the painting; forms shadowy as phantoms, yet full of expression, delineated the sad tragedy of these two lives, united amid so much pomp, to end in such unparalleled woe. 
               The windows of this room were concealed by heavy curtains of crimson damask, on which the arms of France were also embroidered, and the drapery around the couch bore the same insignia of the rank of the pallid phantom that occupied the chair of state. 
               A cadaverous, bloated creature, stunted in his growth, and bearing evidences of imbecility and disease in every lineament of his prematurely worn face, crouched upon the seat, and played with such toys as are usually furnished to young children. He vociferously sounded a baby's rattle, and seemed as much delighted with the noise it made as if he had not passed beyond the age of infancy. Robes of costly material clothed his person, and around his head was a circlet of gold, in which imitation gems glittered in the same order in which they had been placed in the crown wore by the Bourbon race in their day of power and pride. 
                
               After a few moments, he threw aside the rattle, and spoke in a rapid and querulous tone: 
               "Where is la marquise? My negress, my slave fails to come. What has become of my lord chancellor? Oh! I am hungry-I have had no lunch, I am hungry-h-u-n-g-r-y!" 
               The last word was wailed forth with an expression of childish impatience, and as he turned his head toward the door, his eyes fell upon the pale astonished face of the intruder. His features brightened for an instant, and then sunk into an expression of confused fear and uncertainty. He beckoned Adrienne to come forward, as he muttered: 
               "Who is this pale girl? Is it a goblin? No-no-pretty, too pretty. Come here; let me touch you; I touch everybody that comes about me; how can I be sure they are real, unless I touch 'em? Come here, I say; nobody crosses me in this house, for am I not King? Look there, and there, and there are the signs of my rank;" and he pointed to the crown and the arms which decorated the hangings. 
               Like one walking in a dream, Adrienne advanced and stood near enough to him to permit him to stretch forth his yellow hand and lightly touch her own. With a vivid thrill of repulsion she snatched it from the clammy contact, and shrank away, as she asked: 
               "Who are you, and why are you shut up here?" 
               "Have I not already told you," he petulantly replied. "Am I not King? I am Louis of France, and this is my hall of state. Pretty, isn't it? grand, isn't it? who has as fine things as I have? No one, I trow; for am I not King?" 
               "What insane mockery is this?" exclaimed Adrienne. "An imbecile prisoner taught to believe himself king over a great country! Again I ask, who are you, and who has placed you here amid the sham evidences of royalty that surround you?" 
               A sparkle of anger lit up his pale eyes, and he said: 
               "You had better go away, if you doubt my right to these things. My grand chamberlain shall teach you better. I will tell him how you behave to me when he comes in. Yes-I shall surely tell him." 
               "Who is your grand chamberlain, and when does he come to see you?" 
               "Oh, he is a grand man. He comes every day with my lunch. But he is late to-day, and I am hungry-hungry-h-u-n-g-r-y." 
               Again that strange discordant wail sounded through the room, but he suddenly interrupted it to exclaim: 
               "There! I hear him coming at last, and I shall see his grim face glower and flash upon you for coming in here to insult me." 
               To her intense terror, Adrienne also heard steps ascending the stairway, and her first impression was to rush out and seek concealment behind some of the boxes in the anteroom; but the roi faneant seemed to fathom her intention, for he said: 
               "You shan't run away now, for I'll tell him you were here. Since you've come in here once, you shall come again, for you're the only pretty thing I've seen since they made me king. Yes, you're young and fair, and I like to see you here." 
               Summoning all her courage to her aid, Adrienne saw that it was necessary to stand her ground, and bear the consequences of her own act, let them be what they might. 
               She heard the voice of M. Lecour utter a loud oath when he found the door unclosed, and he came with rapid steps toward the upper room, followed by Eady bearing a waiter upon her head. White with rage, he rushed into the apartment, wearing a crimson tunic elaborately embroidered with gold, and carrying in his hand a chamberlain's wand of office. He bowed before the dais, and waved it thrice before he found utterance for the tide of anger that surged within him. He then said: 
               "Pardon me, my prince, but I am not answerable for this intrusion. This young person has committed an unparalleled outrage in coming into this portion of the house without my permission. I will settle with her myself, and guard against such an intrusion again." 
               He imperiously motioned to Adrienne to retire, and she would gladly have made her escape, but the Prince interfered. 
               "Let her stay, my Lord, now she is here. I am not sorry she came, either. Let her come every day, and I will be good. I will give you no trouble, if this pretty creature may wait on me, instead of my black marquise. She makes very nice cakes, but she is ugly-ugly, and I like pretty things. If I am King, it shall be so; yes, yes, it shall be so." 
               M. Lecour turned fiercely toward Adrienne, as he hastily said: 
               "You see what you have brought on yourself by your miserable spirit of prying. You may henceforth consider yourself bound to servitude, for now you are his slave, as well as mine." 
               "I am willing to bear the yoke that duty imposes, as long as it can be borne without degradation. If it is made too burdensome, I will throw it aside, for I am no born serf," said the girl with spirit. "It was wrong, perhaps, to come hither without permission, but I do not regret that I have done so." 
               M. Lecour coldly replied: 
                
               "In making this, discovery, you have raised a barrier to your departure from this dreary household, for I let no one forth who holds the secret of his existence." 
               "Who, then, is it who is mocked by a semblance of royal state in this desolate prison-house?" 
               "It is no mockery, but a faint shadow of that to which he was born. Adrienne, the child whose sufferings in the Temple, whose treatment by the infamous Simon, have filled the civilized world with horror and indignation, is before you. Louis XVII, of France is the imbecile who sits upon that mimic throne, crownless, helpless, but still a king in name as long as I have aught left over which he may reign as my lawful sovereign." 
               "I thought him long since dead," replied the young girl, in bewildered surprise at this singular announcement. 
               "So all Europe believes; but he is here, living and breathing before you. Kneel, and do homage to him as your true king." 
               Tears rushed to the eyes of Adrienne, for she was familiar with that touching story; and she bent reverently before the phantom of royalty, and said: 
               "Unfortunate Prince, consecrated by suffering, baptized in blood, receive the homage of a truly loyal heart. I rejoice that I came hither, since it gives me the right to brighten your sad life, by consecrating to you a portion of my own." 
               The Prince stared in dull surprise, but at length he seemed to comprehend that in future this fair creature was to devote herself to his service; and he put out his pallid hand and placed it upon her head, as he said: 
               "Good child, good child-loyal to her King. Yes-come and play with me every day. Come when la marquise brings my food, and you shall eat with me-it is tiresome eating always alone. You shall read me to sleep, and I shall be indulgent; oh yes, very indulgent to you. I will permit you to sit when you are tired; I will let you talk as long as I am amused, and you shall comb my hair; old Marquise pulls it, but your dainty fingers will be soft and tender." 
               The enthusiasm of Adrienne was slightly cooled by these words, setting forth the duties be intended to exact of her, but her young heart throbbed with compassion for the terrible wreck before her, and she did not recoil from the new path into which she had so wilfully thrust herself. 
               "Arise, Adrienne," said M. Lecour, "and endeavor to make yourself of some use. Bring forward yonder table, and place it before the Prince." 
               Thus commanded, Adrienne lifted a small carved stand and brought it to the spot indicated by M. Lecour. It was then covered with a white napkin, and several silver dishes, filled with dried fruits, cakes and nuts, placed upon it. 
               The Prince eyed them ravenously, and scarcely waited for the dishes to be placed within his reach before he thrust both hands into them, and began to devour their contents like one half famished. 
               M. Lecour stood respectfully in waiting, holding his wand in his hand, but the cynical smile with which he surveyed the scene revealed what was passing within him. It plainly said: 
               "Behold the descendant of the haughtiest line of kings Europe has ever known, munching his food with the appetite of a brute-with no regard to forms-intent only on satisfying his hunger, while I, a man of the people, offer him the mockery of kingly homage, that I may gloat over his imbecile lack of all that dignifies man as man. Ah! is not this a triumph for a sans culotte." 
               Penetrated with shame and pity at this humiliating scene, Adrienne cast her eyes upon the floor, and stood silently before him, while Eady looked on in mute astonishment that the daring of the young girl had brought no worse punishment than a few rough words from the stern master of the house. 
               "Here-take this from my hand, my pretty Comtesse, and do not come again in that ugly dress. Take from my coffers the means to get nicer ones, and come hither in robes of state suited to your new rank. A king can confer titles, and you are now one of my court." 
               Adrienne accepted the citron, and pretended to taste it, but she thrust it in the sleeve of her dress. M. Lecour sharply said: 
               "Why do you not return thanks to his majesty for the distinction he has conferred upon you, and promise to obey his commands? Kneel, ungrateful girl, and kiss the hand that bestows such honors." 
               Louis smiled approvingly, and Adrienne felt compelled to play her part in the royal farce, or arouse the anger of her grandfather. She bent her lithe form, and bowed her head over the clammy hand that was extended toward her with an air of condescension she could not help feeling to be absurd. M. Lecour, however, looked as if perfectly in earnest, and she went through with what was required of her, at least with a show of outward respect for the fantastic claims this poor dependent creature had been taught to consider real. 
               Louis threw himself back on his seat, yawned portentously, and said, with pompous gravity: 
               "And now, my lieges, you are dismissed while I take my siesta. Madame la Marquise, see that I have an abundant and appetizing dinner; a superb dinner, with wine-yes, yes, but not red wine. I cannot bear to see it bubble out like the blood that was shed in those days when Simon held me, and forced me to look on while-oh-h, horror!" and with a convulsive shudder, he fell back in a species of cataleptic fit, as the memory of those awful days returned to him. 
               Adrienne impulsively sprang forward, caught the sinking head, and kept it from falling until M. Lecour lifted him with the assistance of Eady and placed him upon the couch. She then saw that his limbs fell quite powerless, and understood how it had been possible to keep him in his prison without a chance of escape. 
               The young girl tenderly bathed his poor face with cold water, and he presently revived sufficiently to say: 
               "I need sleep, my lieges-sleep will quite restore us. Leave us now, that we may be ready for the dinner as soon as it is served. Au revoir. Madame la Comtesse, I command you to appear at my table in suitable attire; for the present, adieu." 
               He waved his hand and bowing respectfully, the three thus dismissed retired, stepping backward toward the door with all the outward ceremony that would have been observed had the poor actor really enjoyed the rank to which he was born. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               LECOUR GIVES ADRIENNE HIS CONFIDENCE. 
               EADY was the last one to leave the room, and she turned the key in the lock, and this time put it in her pocket, while she regarded Adrienne in silent amazement. M. Lecour witnessed the action, and dryly said: 
               "Restore the key to its usual place, Jackdaw. In future it will be useful to this wilful girl, as she will release you from much of your attendance on our helpless guest." 
                
               "I aint above attendin' to my own business," said Eady, sturdily, "an' I aint gwine to put no sich service on my young mistis." 
               "The menial service you must still perform, of course; but Adrienne will necessarily become the companion of many of the vacant hours of the poor recluse. It is well for him, perhaps, that she came hither, but not so well for herself, for she will find it but a weary burden to find amusement for a poor imbecile like Prince Louis." 
               "If I can brighten his life, I am willing to undertake it," replied Adrienne, with an expression of sincerity which brought a satirical smile to the lips of M. Lecour. He paused in the lower hall, and laid aside his crimson robe and his wand of office. 
               Eady took charge of them, and turning to Adrienne, he sternly said: 
               "Come with me and hear the history your disobedience has compelled me to confide to you." 
               "Adrienne followed him with alacrity, for she was yet in a state of amazement at the extraordinary nature of the morning's revelation. She was yet incredulous of the fact that the Prince, who was believed dead in his own country, whose decease was there officially recorded, whose monument had been erected, yet lived in exile, his existence denied-his identity disputed. 
               M. Lecour closed the door behind them, pointed to a seat, and threw himself into a large arm-chair. After a few moments of moody thought, he aroused himself and said: 
               "I have been meditating on the possibility of entrusting to you the sad secret of this house, Mademoiselle, and therefore your rash act escapes the anger it would otherwise have aroused. Since it was your will to come hither, I had already concluded to make you useful in relieving me of the burdensome task of reading such books to the Prince as are suited to his capacity. He has a passion for tales of fiction, but he is incapable of reading them intelligent. He is necessarily confined to his apartment the greater part of the time, for he is entirely helpless, as you saw yourself. You are young enough to amuse him by joining in the childish plays he is fond of, and therefore I forgive you for your intrusion to-day. His presence beneath this roof could not long have been kept a secret from you at any rate." 
               "And is this really and truly the son of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette? How, then, has all France been deceived into the belief that he perished from the effects of the ill-treatment he received?" 
               "That was managed easily enough, A boy suffering from the same disease, which had almost run its course, was sought for and found in one of the public hospitals. While he took the place of Louis of France, the young prince was secretly removed to Marseilles, and placed on board a vessel bound for New Orleans. While his substitute breathed his last, Louis was conveyed from his native land forever." 
               "And why was this done?" 
               "To remove an imbecile from the path of his uncle, who will yet rule France as Louis XVIII." 
               "And you?-what led you to undertake this charge, mon pre?" 
               A scornful smile wreathed his lip, as he replied: 
               "It will doubtless shock you to hear that money was the inducement. A large bribe and a munificent annuity were my rewards for the service. A powerful relative wished the poor lad out of the realm which he was manifestly unfit to govern. After all his sufferings, he hesitated to remove him by the aid of a good chemist; Louis might live out his miserable span of existence if he was taken from his path. He pledged himself to provide him with such means of enjoyment joyment as he was capable of appreciating, so long as he was kept in strict seclusion, and his existence entirely unsuspected by his countrymen." 
               "And how was it that you were the agent selected to carry out their plan?" 
               "I am quite willing to tell you why I assumed this charge; but it involves a portion of my previous history. I was one of the fiercest of those democrats who called for the blood of the Austrian woman and her facile husband. Poor creature! he was only unfitted by nature for the position to which he was born; the great mother intended him for a maker of locks, and not a violator of laws; he, poor dullard! was merely a tool in the hands of others, with no will of his own to persist in any course, whether for good or for evil. I was once the friend of Danton-I possessed his confidence, and but for my counsels the massacres of September had never deluged the streets of Paris with blood. Yes, I glory in the remembrance of those days; the cursed aristocrats fell beneath the knife of the guillotine-beneath the blade of the assassin, and their life-blood watered the pavements over which they had flaunted in their, haughty disdain of the working million. It was just! It was just, and I do not regret my part in the grand tragedy." 
               He arose, threw his arms aloft, and walked to and fro in an excited manner. Chilled, appalled by this revelation, Adrienne sat cold and pale, her eyes following his movements with such fascination as the reptile exercises over the bird he intends to make his prey. 
               M. Lecour caught the expression of her face, and rightly interpreted it. He laughed aloud, as he stopped suddenly in front of her, and said: 
               "You are shocked-you are amazed; you feel very much like the child in the fairy tale when she found herself in the den of the ogre. Yes, I am your ogre. I read it in your scared face, and I warn you that I can be worse than one, as my whole career can prove. Cherish a wholesome fear of me, Mademoiselle, for it will be your best safeguard." 
               Her white lips unclosed, and she said: 
               "No, mon pre, I am not afraid of you, for I do not believe that you would wilfully harm me; but I am terrified at this unlooked for revelation. I wish to love, to reverence you, and you seem to exult in your power to place yourself before me as the defier of all laws; as one who has trampled on the sacred right of every human being to dwell on God's earth, till He himself sees fit to recall the life he has given." 
               M. Lecour regarded her with grim composure, and there was horrible sarcasm in the icy tones of his voice, as he replied: 
               "'Might makes right,' says the old adage, and I elect to believe in it-to act on it. I am a bad man, Mademoiselle, a fatal man, but I am no hypocrite. I stand before you in my true colors. Listen to what further I have to reveal to you." 
               Adrienne bowed submissively, and he went on: 
               "I stirred up the masses against the King-I helped to give a more savage tone to the voices that cried out for the blood of God's anointed. His head fell, but the vengeance of the people was still unsatisfied-the true curse of France lived in the Austrian woman, on whose head I charged all the evils of her vacillating husband's reign. I will be just enough to myself to say that I fully believed the vilest calumnies that were uttered against her, and I was frantic for the atonement of blood. I saw no justice in taking the life of our own king, if this foreigner, who had instigated him to the acts for which the nation demanded atonement, was permitted to live. Yes-I was resolute that the queenly head of Maria Theresa's daughter should fall beneath the knife of the executioner, and I rested not till she was brought to trial." 
               He paused, and Adrienne faintly said: 
               "Go on, Monsieur; your story has a terrible interest for me." 
               A marked interest passed over M. Lecour's face. The expression lost much of its fierceness, and his voice had quite changed its tone when he next spoke. 
               "On her trial, for the first time was I brought face to face with this royal heroine, and I felt that a truly great soul inhabited that delicate woman's body. My feelings underwent a strange revulsion as I looked upon the worn face, the hair silvered by anguish, and witnessed the simple dignity with which she repelled the insults heaped upon the daughter of the Csars. Oh! amid its darkest epochs, the world has witnessed no such scene as that! A crowned queen of the greatest nation on earth arraigned as a common criminal! her purity insulted, her dignity outraged, by a lawless mob who claimed to be her judges! 
               "All the enormity of the crime we were about to perpetrate flashed suddenly upon me. It came as a revelation from another world, and I do not pretend to account for the sudden revulsion my feelings underwent. I felt that I must speak in her defence or die; I ventured to address the raging mob whose passions I had helped to arouse, and I faltered something which meant that armed men should find better employment than making war on a defenceless woman. Those few words came near costing me my life; the human tigers had feasted on blood too long to give up their victim, and a howl of rage was the reply I received. They would have thrown themselves upon me, and hurled me too to destruction if I had not at once retracted my feeble effort at defence. I was compelled to show that I was eager for the destruction of the unfortunate woman before the tribunal. They demanded of me a speech setting forth her crimes against the dignity of the realm over which she had reigned, and I was base enough to obey the command. With reckless eloquence I summed up all the evil deeds of which she was accused, and asked death as their penalty. With applauding cries, and clapping of hands, the sentence was pronounced; I looked but once at that fallen majesty. She stood calm and unmoved; after all the horrors to which she had been subjected, the repose of the grave was evidently welcome. I saw it in the composed resignation of her face; I read it in the deep sadness of her eyes. Oh, then I could have kneeled before her, and prayed for pardon for all the wrong I knew that I had done her; but it was too late-too late. The evil was accomplished, and I was powerless to aid or save!" 
               He paused, and Adrienne earnestly said: 
               "Go on, mon pre; you interest me deeply; you prove that humanity was not utterly dead within you. I know how the queen perished, but what of yourself in those frightful days?" 
               "Ah child! do not expect that I shall attempt to clear myself from the stain of blood. No-it clings to me forever-it blights my days, and renders night terrible to me. Its curse is your heritage, as it has been my punishment, for the evil I aided to accomplish." 
               Adrienne shivered and grew pale, but M. Lecour went on apparently regardless of her emotion: 
               "I asked to stand sentinel over Marie Antoinette during the last night she was to spend on earth. I had sufficient interest to secure this favor, and I watched her without ceasing throughout its dreary hours. I saw her prepare her death toilette from the meagre and wretched materials in her possession. Look! behold the Queen of France, in the cell whose very atmosphere was heavy with the sighs of those who had preceded her in its narrow walls." 
                
               He approached the picture which stood upon his easel, swept aside the curtain that hung over it, and pointed to the stately figure of the fallen queen. Tears rushed into Adrienne's eyes, as she beheld the noble face, and silver hair-the delicate hands engaged in repairing her shoes for the last service that would be required of them. 
               M. Lecour went on in a more subdued tone: 
               "I ventured to approach her, and said in a guarded tone: 
               "'Citizeness, I would have saved you to-day, but the mob was too strong for me. I spoke against you, but I did it unwillingly. I would atone for the wrongs I have done you by any service you may claim, which it is possible for me to render.' 
               "She looked up with an expression of surprise, and steadily regarded me a few moments. I do not know what she read in my face, but she seemed moved, as she replied: 
               "'I have now but one earthly care-my children-they will be barbarously treated, perhaps destroyed. If you can do so, save the heir of France; take my forgiveness for any evil you have done to me, if you will befriend my helpless darlings.' 
               "'I swear to do so to the best of my ability,' I replied; and I endeavored to redeem that pledge. It was long-long before I had the power to do so. Danton, my patron, fell, and I was involved in his ruin. I was forced to live in concealment, and in my turn I endured all the horrors of the fugitive whose life is hunted by the remorseless bloodhounds of a sanguinary mob. 
               "The Reign of Terror slowly passed away; a new era dawned upon the country whose soil was deluged by the blood shed in the name of liberty. I came forth from my hiding place, and sought the means of fulfilling my promise to the hapless Marie Antoinette. Her son was removed from the power of the vile shoemaker, who had wrecked both mind and body by the unparalleled ill-treatment he had inflicted upon the unfortunate child. I found him under the care of respectable people who endeavored to restore him to health and happiness. I sought the post of attendant upon him, and as I had some knowledge of medicine, the physician who waited on him employed me to carry out his system of treatment more intelligently than an ordinary nurse could have done. 
               "The health of Louis slowly improved, but his dulled intellect never brightened. He could be taught to repeat a form of words, but they conveyed no ideas to his vacant mind. I soon saw that the mischief was irremediable. A sprightly intelligent child had been slowly tortured into semi-idiocy, and there was no balm in Gilead for his restoration. 
               "This conviction had scarcely fixed itself upon my mind, when an agent from the Compte D'Artois sought me and proposed to me to remove the unfortunate boy from his path, when a way seemed opening to him to ascend his brother's throne. I knew that if I refused less scrupulous means might be found for getting rid of the unhappy child, and I believed this was the only means of fulfilling my promise to his mother. I do not wish to appear better than I am, and I will also admit that my own interests were too well secured to permit me to hesitate long on the course it was expedient for me to pursue. In a private hospital, a lad of Louis' age and complexion had already been found who could be substituted as the heir of France. I could easily evade suspicion by leaving the country with my young charge on a vessel chartered for that purpose by my employer. 
               "I was broken in fortune, and callous in mind. My country, after passing through a crisis unexampled in the history of the world, was settling back under the rule of the very class from which such frantic struggles had been made to release her; and all the blood shed had been vain to establish the equal rights of men. I had despaired of France as a free country, and I began to regard the acquisition of money as the great end of existence. I accepted the terms offered to me, and prepared to remove the Prince when the vessel was ready to sail. 
               "My chemical knowledge enabled me to produce the appearance of sinking in the feeble frame of Louis; I sat up with him that night, and during its silence and darkness, the dying boy was brought from the hospital, while the living one was sent away in a state of lethargy produced by the stupefying potion I had administered to him. The resemblance between the two was quite sufficient for our purpose, and when the physician came to pay his morning visit, he merely glanced at the skeleton frame whose death he was called on to report officially. The decease of the lad did not surprise him, for he had looked for it for several days, and the evasion was so adroitly managed, that I believe he had no suspicion of the true facts of the case. An annuity was secured to me during the life of the young Prince, besides a considerable sum of money for immediate use, and I considered my promise to his mother to be faithfully kept by the part I played in this transaction. I felt the assurance in my own mind, that less scrupulous means would be resorted to, if the unhappy lad was left in the power of those to whom his removal was of such vital importance. I knew his unfitness for the position to which his birth entitled him, and I saved him from perishing by poison, if he were left in the power of those who might be tempted to use it in some new political crisis." 
               "But that crisis has never arisen," said Adrienne. 
               "Not yet-but it will come. The soldier of fortune who now rules France will meet his downfall some of these days, and the legitimate ruler will yet wield the sceptre held by his ancestors. I am certain that a reaction is taking place even now, for a priest to whom the exchange of lads was made known in the confessional, has been sent hither as a spy upon me, and I believe that his object is to prove the existence of this unhappy boy. I warn you against betraying your knowledge of these facts, for if Father Eustace discovers the presence of the Prince beneath my roof, it will cause evil to many." 
               Adrienne started, and listened with even deeper interest than before. She endeavored to conceal her emotion by asking: 
               "Why have you thought it necessary to surround the unfortunate youth with the outward semblance of royal state? To imbue his mind with the idea that he is really a king?" 
               "Ah! that is the revenge my cynical pride induced me to take upon royalty degraded in his poor imbecile person. I am a republican still-a rabid one if you will, and it amuses me to make this wretched creature, dethroned of reason as well as of power, play the part of a roi fainant. It can do no harm to any one, and what was at first a jest, has now become a habit and a necessity to the poor imbecile. If he were deprived of the empty state in which he lives, Louis would pine away and die. I should lose my annuity, and the power I possess over certain persons in Europe, to whom the reappearance of this poor lad on the political arena would be fatal. It is even said that a project has been formed to proclaim Louis king, with Bonaparte as military dictator. The little Corsican can do better than that, as he will soon prove by seizing imperial power. I am far away from France, but am kept well informed of what is passing there, and I can dispassionately judge of the march of events. I am talking to you, child, as if you can comprehend all these affairs: go-leave me-I have talked too much already. Take your new task upon yourself to-day, and be wary of the priest, if he should attempt to communicate with you." 
               He imperatively motioned to her to leave him. and Adrienne arose to obey. She asked: 
               "How am I to comply with the prince's wish with reference to my dress, mon pre? I have only two robes and both are black." 
               "True-that must be remedied. There are loads of finery in the house that once belonged to Madame Lecour. She was most extravagant in her toilette, and her figure was not unlike yours. Tell Eady to open some of her hoards, and deck yourself according to your fancy. I care nothing for the wardrobe which has so long lain useless, and you can take unlimited possession." 
               With many thanks, Adrienne turned to leave him, but M. Lecour suddenly barred her egress from the door, and sternly asked: 
               "Do you comprehend the vital importance of the secret imparted to you, Adrienne? Will you defend it even at the risk of your own life? Aye-even if that wily priest tells you that your future salvation depends upon your faithlessness to the trust reposed in you, will you be true to it?" 
               This question placed Adrienne in a cruel dilemma, but the natural uprightness of her character showed her clearly that to this old man she owed her first allegiance, even if the other was her father; for M. Lecour had given her shelter beneath his roof, however grudgingly it had been done, and her whole soul recoiled from the idea of domestic treachery. She would guard his secret faithfully, and she firmly replied: 
               "I fully comprehend the weight of the trust reposed in me, and I promise fidelity even unto death." 
               M. Lecour regarded her face with a look of intense scrutiny, before he replied: 
                
               "I believe you, child. I believe you are of the true metal, and I am not afraid of treachery on your part." 
               "Thank you for that, mon pre. I will surely prove myself worthy of your confidence." 
               Adrienne left the room, and M. Lecour regarded the portrait of Marie Antoinette with an expression of mixed fear and awe, as he muttered: 
               "Enlighten me, oh royal shadow, as to the course to be pursued in this crisis. Will it be best to keep him here in his seclusion, or permit him to become the puppet of another's ambition? Speak! Your sad lips have before unclosed to threaten or to warn. Why should they be silent now?" 
               He bent his head in a listening attitude, and watched the sad face; but to-day it was motionless-the effects of the Indian drug had died out in his veins, and the hallucination did not come at his command. 
               "Silent!" he exclaimed. "Then I may follow my own will; so ho, for France, and royal state! I accept the Corsican's offer, and swear vendetta against him if he plays me false!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               THE PRISONER AND HIS NEW COMPANION. 
               ADRIENNE went at once to the domains of the negress, and without preamble informed her of the permission given by M. Lecour to choose from the wardrobe of his late wife such attire as might suit her fancy. The old woman regarded her even with more intense amazement than she had manifested during the scene in the apartment of the prince. She rolled up her eyes till the whites were alone visible, and said: 
                
               "I 'clar to Moses, you mus' have de sarpint's power to fascerate folks, as de evil one fascerated de fustest woman, for you already twisses my ole marster roun' yer finger, an' makes him do whatever you pleases. Give you my missuses finery, mus' I? Well-I never 'spected to have sich a order from him, but I carnt do less den 'bey it. De close is lyin' in de drawers, gittin' yaller an' doin' nobody any good; so I s'pose you mought as well wear 'em as not; but it's mighty currus, and I don' pertend to understan' how you got roun' him myself. I only hopes you'll be 'lowed to wear 'em in peace." 
               "What do you mean? Who is to interfere with my wearing them, since my grandfather has given me permission to do so?" 
               Eady regarded her with a singular expression, as she said, in a suppressed tone: 
               "'S'posen de ghose was to take it in her head to claim 'em, what den? You saw her put on de bridal dresses, an' why shant she choose to put on some o' de res'? Dey all b'longed to her onct." 
               "Ah! you admit the reality of that scene, then?" said Adrienne, aroused to vivid interest. "Phantoms do not put on real garments, Eady, and that white-haired woman was no more a ghost than is the prince up stairs. You see I have penetrated the secret of his presence beneath this roof, and it will be to your best interest to take me into your confidence respecting the mysterious presence in my room last night." 
               Eady shook her head ominously: 
               "Our perlosofy don't teach us all de tings what goes on in Hebben, or on yeth; as I heard my ole marster read out'n a book onct; an' it sounded mighty gran'! It was from a play, whar a sure'nuff ghose comes to tell his son dat his brother have murdered him. Ef a ghose comes to dat young man, why carnt a ghose come agin, I axes yer, young mistis? An' I tell you 'taint no use to come arter me to tell you nothin', caze I don' know nothin to tell." 
               With these words Eady assumed an expression of dogged obstinacy, and Adrienne saw it would be useless to question her further. With the resolution to use her own eyes and senses to fathom the secret of the sable housekeeper, she silently followed her to her own chamber. 
               Eady produced the key of the armoire, and unlocked the door next to the window. A row of shelves was before Adrienne, filled with linen bags, each one of which was found to contain an elegant and expensive dress. They were made in the fashion of a past day, but that mattered little in the out-of-the-way place in which they were to be worn. The voluminous skirts, pointed waists, and sleeves tight to the elbow, with deep falls of fine lace, showed that many years had passed away since the mantua maker's art had fashioned them. But the materials were of the richest texture and most graceful designs, and Adrienne regarded them with the natural delight of a young and attractive girl, who is conscious that tasteful costume imparts a new charm to even the fairest form and face. 
               She selected one of the plainest among them for present use. It was a lilac brocade, with trimmings of black lace, relieved by knots of pink ribbon. Eady then unclosed a drawer in which fine laces, filmy handkerchiefs and gloves were laid away. The kid gloves were hard and spotted, rendered unfit for use by the dampness of the climate; but there were gloves of white and black lace, which fitted Adrienne's hands as if made for them, and from these she selected a pair of the latter. 
               Eady looked on with a dubious expression-a doubt evidently existed in her mind as to what might result from this appropriation. She muttered: 
                
               "I s'pose since you've got one part o' de fixin's, you mought as well have t'other too;" and she next unlocked a drawer filled with slippers of every color, trimmed with large rosettes, and mounted on high, narrow heels. There was a pair to match each dress, and the most of them seemed as if they had scarcely been worn at all. Eady said: 
               "Now, ef you can wear de madame's shoes, young mistis, you'll 'stonish me, for she had de cunningest leetle feet in de worl'." 
               Adrienne sat down, and taking off her own shoe, drew on one of Madame Lecour's slippers as easily as if it had been made for her. She laughed as she held out her foot, and said: 
               "It is small enough for Cinderella, but you see it fits me perfectly. I half believe your mistress was my fairy godmother, Eady, and endowed me with a body to match her cast off finery, because she knew it would be my only chance to obtain a suitable wardrobe. If she comes back in ghostly form again to dispute possession with me, I believe I will really do battle with her for my finery." 
               "Hush-h-h, chile; don' talk sich idle talk; it makes my flesh creep to hear you run on so. Ef she do come back, young mistis, it won't be to hurt you, I am sure, an' you won't say nothin' to him, even if you do git badly scared." 
               She pointed impressively toward her marster's room to give stronger emphasis to the pronoun, and Adrienne seriously replied: 
               "I shall not break the promise I gave you this morning, Eady; but I warn you that I shall be on the qui vive to make discoveries myself, and I pledge myself to nothing with regard to them. Since you will not confide to me the real secret of this White Terror, I shall make every effort to fathom it myself. Once mine, I shall make what use I please of my knowledge." 
                
               "La, chile, how can I 'splain to you what I don' onstan' myself? Ef de ghose comes, it comes, an' ole Eady ain't got no infymation of its doin's. So you don' confirm marster's notions 'bout its comin' to him, I don't care. He's de only creetur I'm 'fraid of on dis blessed yeth." 
               "If it was really a spirit that walked about my room last night, M. Lecour would be powerless to injure it. Why, then, should you fear him in connection with the phantom?" 
               "Taint no use talkin', young mistis. Niggers is niggers, an' dey'll allers b'lieve in ghoses. But it's mighty strange dat white folks won't b'lieve, even when dey's seen 'em, wi' dere own eyes. You's bin all over dis house now, an' I axes you where could dat white lady stay?" 
               To this question Adrienne had no reply, for she believed she had now explored every nook of the old mansion, and she had certainly beheld no evidences that the apartments in the forsaken portion were inhabited. She however said at random: 
               "If I had access to every part of the house whenever I chose to visit it, perhaps I might make some discoveries; but you keep the doors locked, and only exhibit the rooms when you are sure they are unoccupied." 
               "I only 'beys orders," replied Eady, demurely. "My marster don't 'low de 'partments to be opened, an' he wouldn't care ef de dus? an' de rats took persession. I likes to keep de things in order, caze my mistis was mighty pertickeler, an' ef her ghose do come back, I don' want her to find dat ole Eady has forgot how to clean up things nice. Come, chile, ef you's gwine to put on dem fineries, let me help you to onct, caze I must go back to my cooking. 'Taint no trifle to git up dinners for de marster, an' dat young man up stairs, for dey bofe thinks more of their eatin' than of anything else in dis here wail o' tears. Ef you puts on dat dress, your ha'r must be fixed up like hern used to be." 
               "What? mounted on the top of my head like a helmet, and powdered? No, thank you, I had rather keep it in its natural state." 
               "But jes' let me put it up for onct, young mistis. Jes' do it now to please me, caze I want ter see how much you'll look like de madame wid one of her dresses on you." 
               But little persuasion was necessary to induce Adrienne to gratify this whim of the old housekeeper, and her glistening hair was soon twined over a cushion, in the style of the latter part of the last century, and then lightly sprinkled with a perfumed powder which was produced from some recess known to the sable handmaiden. 
               The dress was then donned, and found to fit with sufficient accuracy to set off to advantage the light and graceful form of its wearer, and Adrienne gazed with youthful delight into the large cheval glass, upon the brilliant apparition reflected there. Her ruby lips wore a charming smile, as she said: 
               "I declare I am quite enchanted with the effect of this dress. How much more graceful are these voluminous folds flowing from this pointed boddice, than the scanty drapery and short waists now in fashion in France. Elegant as the wife of the first consul is conceded to be, she lacks the good taste to see how much is sacrificed by the style of costume she has seen fit to adopt." 
               Eady was scarcely listening to her; she was standing with clasped hands and wondering eyes, and she exclaimed: 
               "I 'clar to Moses, ef you aint the very moral o' the madame. I seen her wi' dat very dress on onct, an' 'cept dat you looks brighter an' younger, you's her 'zact image. What he'll say when he sees you, I don't know." 
               "Am I really so much like Madame Lecour? It seems very strange, for I am sure I am not in any way related to her," said Adrienne, again surveying herself in the mirror. 
               "You is herself over again; I b'lieve it's jes' a judgment on him, an' you is sent here for some purpis bes' known to de Good Man up yonder. Ef 'tis so, He'll work it out in his own way, so you never mine. Jes' go on de p'inted path, an' all will be well enough. Hi! I carn't stan' here talkin' my nonsense all day, I mus' go down to my work. Here am de keys; mebbe you'd bes' keep 'em, dat you may go in de places whenever you like." 
               "Will you give me the same permission with reference to the rooms in the old house?" asked Adrienne, mischievously. 
               "Sho, chile! don't ask what's onpossible. De marster would storm at us bofe an' turn you out o' doors, mebbe, ef he foun' dat you was a takin' possession o' de keys o' de 'partments," and Eady hurried from the room to avoid any further conversation on a subject that evidently annoyed her. 
               Adrienne sat down soberly to review her position and fix some line of conduct which would enable her to evade the demands of Father Eustace, and maintain her fidelity to her grandfather, without arousing the anger of the former. She tried calmly to review the singular events of the day, and the anomalous position in which she found herself placed toward the helpless imbecile whom it was henceforth to be her task to wait on and amuse. 
               With the enthusiasm of a young and untried heart, she believed herself fully competent to fulfill all the duties required of her. She would soothe his wandering mind, elevate his nature, and cultivate in him a belief in that future existence which she could well believe M. Lecour rendered a nullity to the poor outcast of reason. 
               While she yet mused the time sped away, and Pierre came to her door with the announcement that M. Lecour demanded her attendance in the presence chamber, this grandiloquent name having been given by the old recluse to the apartment occupied by his ward. 
               With swift steps Adrienne proceeded toward the prince's chamber; she came as a radiant vision of youth and loveliness into the old ante-room, passed Eady with a smile, and glided into the royal presence with a graceful obesiance. Louis sat expectant and impatient before a small table set out with silver and fine porcelain. M. Lecour, in his robe of state, stood with his wand of office, and as his eyes fell upon the young girl, he trembled and grew white as death. Making a violent effort, he mastered his emotion, and his set face seemed more marble-like than ever, as he motioned to her to receive the dishes brought by Eady, and place them before the prince. 
               Adrienne accomplished this service with ease and grace, and Louis chuckled with satisfaction. He said: 
               "Well done, la belle comtesse, you have earned your title fairly, and now you shall have your reward. You shall eat with my royal self." 
               "That will be a useless and troublesome innovation, mon roi," objected M. Lecour. "If you would eat your food in peace, do not ask a woman to sit down with you. Then you must wait on her, and at present it is the duty of the comtesse to attend to you." 
               "If it is my pleasure to have it the other way, who shall refuse me? Am I not king? Is it not your duty to obey me, monsieur?" 
               "It is my pleasure to do so, mon roi," replied M. Lecour, with a mocking reverence. "Since it is your will, la comtesse shall eat with you. Mademoiselle, take your place opposite to Prince Louis, and see that he wants for nothing." 
                
               Adrienne would gladly have excused herself, but there was no alternative, and she assumed the place indicated. Louis immediately commenced heaping a plate with the daintily prepared viands, which he offered to her acceptance. At a sign from M. Lecour she took it, and before Eady could bring on a second plate for his own use, the prince drew the most tempting dish before him, plunged in a spoon, and commenced eating as if half famished. After despatching that, he seized upon the next, and proceeded thus until Adrienne had reason to congratulate herself that he had thought her worthy of being first served. He swallowed large libations of Burgundy, and nodding toward her over his glass, said: 
               "Not good for you, la comtesse; too much like blood-too much like blood. But I was nursed on it-the red flush is too familiar. Ah-h-h!" and again he fell back in an attack of catalepsy. 
               After a few convulsive struggles, Louis sat up, looked stupidly around, and commanded the dessert to be brought in. This consisted of oranges and nuts, and again he was polite enough to supply the wants of Adrienne before taking any himself. 
               The dinner was at last over, and M. Lecour knelt and offered a bowl of water and a napkin to the mimic royalty to whom it was his whim to do homage. Louis condescendingly said: 
               "My lord chamberlain, I am pleased with you to-day; very much pleased with your consideration in permitting la comtesse to become the companion of my solitude. Leave us now to be read to by her; she shall reveal to us how the Princess Schehezerade kept her head on her shoulders by amusing the caliph; what wonderful new stories she invented for that purpose. La comtesse can imagine herself the princess who was so severely tasked, and maybe she can tell something out of her own head to make the time pass pleasantly." 
               "She will no doubt do her best, mon roi, for she wishes to be of use to you." 
               "Good child-good child, and pretty too-pretty-pretty." Thus muttering, he threw himself back upon his seat, and M. Lecour placed a cushion under his head. Eady rapidly and silently cleared the table, and brought forward a small stand on which was placed a large volume elegantly bound. 
               M. Lecour addressed Adrienne in a low voice. 
               "It is my custom to read to him till he falls asleep, and then, with Pierre's assistance, he is removed to his bed for the night. When he is in that state, ring the bell for Pierre, and you are released until to-morrow." 
               He pointed to the bell-handle near the head of the couch, and with a deep reverence towards Louis, left the apartment. 
               The prince had closed his eyes, and seemed scarcely conscious of what was passing around him. Adrienne opened the volume, and finding a mark between the page, she commenced her task at once. At the sound of her voice he roused himself up, and drowsily said: 
               "Don't begin there, where my lord chamberlain left off. I know the book by heart, and I choose you to turn back to the first part." 
               "If you know it by heart, how can you find any interest in hearing it read? Had I not better get something else to amuse you?" 
               "No-I can't think of new book people. These are all I have ever known about, and I like them best. It is like going on a visit to old friends to hear of them again, and I shall like to listen to your voice telling about them. It is a very sweet and pleasant voice, and you're very pretty to look at too." 
                
               Adrienne did not blush at this openly expressed admiration, her heart was too full of sympathy for the unhappy wreck before her, to attach any importance to his words. She simply said: 
               "I am glad you have taken a fancy to me, for I hope to be useful to you, mon prince. I can tell tales to you as well as read them, and when you get tired of the wonders of the Arabian Nights, I can repeat to you the history of a remarkable personage who came on earth eighteen hundred years ago to preach love, forbearance, and good-will toward men; who gave us the assurance of the life to come after this, in which the sins and infirmities of earth shall be removed from us." 
               Louis listened with half-awakened interest; he suddenly inquired: 
               "In that new world shall I get rid of these helpless limbs of mine, and be able to walk as other people do? Ah! that would be fine." 
               "Yes, there your spiritual body shall be without spot or blemish-beautiful and active, and your mind will resume the highest functions bestowed upon it at its creation, though accident may have dulled it while in its earthly tenement." 
               The speaker had scarcely expected him to understand her, but he evidently did, and he aroused himself from the lethargy that had been creeping over him to inquire: 
               "Why has some one not told me of this before. It is much for a poor creature like me to look forward to a transfiguration like that. It might make one willing to give up this life, but not to have my head cut off! No! no! I have seen. The king, my father; the queen, my poor mother, lost theirs; but I must keep mine. Oh!-h!-h!-that vision of blood comes again to blast my sight." 
               He fell back, and again the convulsions distorted his poor face, and large drops of perspiration burst out upon his brow. 
               Adrienne hastened to bathe it with cold water, and Louis in a few moments recovered his usual expression of dull serenity. Fearful of arousing the terrible memories which had evidently left their indelible traces upon his mind, feeble as it was, the young girl at once commenced her task of reading aloud. 
               The prince closed his eyes, and remained perfectly quiescent, only occasionally making some faint sign that he was still awake and listening. The light from the window in the roof began to fail, and the reader paused with the intention of lighting the wax candles which Eady had placed upon the table before leaving the room, but Louis arrested her, and said: 
               "I like the twilight, and shall like to hear you talk. Tell me about that wonderful personage of whom you spoke just now. Was he a man? and where did he come from? and where has he gone to? I am sure we need him as much now, as the people did among whom he lived." 
               "That is true, for we cannot live as we should without him; but he left his teaching to us when he went up to heaven; they are found in the same book that tells of his life and death." 
               "Where is this book? Why has not my lord chamberlain told us of this thing before? It has been very remiss in him not to do so, when we need it so sorely too." 
               "Let me supply that need, my prince, and do not reproach my grandfather with his negligence. People who live in the world are often indifferent to this wonderful revelation; but to the weak, the suffering and the oppressed, it is a consolation and a hope." 
               "Then give it to me, la comtesse, for I am suffering, I am weak, though the royal blood of France is my heritage. I know very well what I should have been, though my brain is shattered, and my body helpless and deformed. When I sit here alone, I have glimpses of former days. I remember, as a dream, the stately palace in which my infancy was passed; the rush of the people that came against it; the proud bearing of my mother, though she was pale as marble. I can also recall the awful scene at Versailles when she carried her children upon the balcony as a protection against the mob that raged for her life; and the journey back to Paris amid all those terrible people, comes before me. Oh! that was the first blow to me-something in my childish brain gave way then, and it has never been exactly right since." 
               Louis sat erect, his eyes grew brighter, and a new life seemed to be breathed into his languid frame by the sympathy and companionship of one near his own age. Gradually Adrienne succeeded in lulling the painful memories that surged out of the melancholy past of this victim to man's inhumanity. She returned to the subject on which she had first spoken; and with simple words and soft intonation related the incidents of the Saviour's life to her attentive listener. When she had finished, Louis said: 
               "It is beautiful, and it seems to me that I have been taught the same things before all the dreadful troubles that came upon us. You must tell me about the Good Man every day, la comtesse." 
               Adrienne readily promised to do so; and, wearied by this time with the unwonted efforts at reflection which he had made, Louis sunk back like a child, and almost immediately fell asleep. 
               Fearful of arousing him, the young girl sat perfectly still in the gathering twilight, watching the faint flickering of the smoldering fire upon the hearth as it flashed up into a blaze at intervals, and then quickly died out, leaving the shadows in the room deeper than before. 
                
               It was a strange scene; the lonely room, with its rich furniture and royal trappings; the pale, slumbering prince, robed in purple and fine linen, and the fair young girl, seated on a tabouret at his feet, dressed in the style of a past generation which so well became her, as she sat with her hands clasped over each other, thinking of the singular developments of the past hours, and wondering what strange thing would next happen in this mysterious old house. 
               A large mirror occupied the space over the mantel, and in this was reflected the heavy folds of drapery that concealed a long narrow recess, from which opened a dormer window. Suddenly the curtain was lifted, and from the setting sun a stream of light flowed into the apartment. Startled from her reverie, Adrienne looked up, and sat as one spell-bound; within the mirror she saw distinctly reflected a tall figure clothed in a loose white robe, with wide hanging sleeves, which fell from her throat to her feet. Her face was colorless as that of the dead, and floating around it was a halo of silvery hair. Over her whole person was thrown a filmy vail, which looked as airy and transparent as the wreaths of mist that float away before the morning sunshine. 
               A single glance thrilled the frame of the beholder with shuddering awe, for she at once recognized the White Terror which had appeared in her room on the previous night. Yet Adrienne could not believe it to be a supernatural appearance, and she started up with the purpose of rushing towards it, and testing its reality by grasping the form with her own hands. 
               Swift as her motions were, when she turned twilight again reigned throughout the room, and the curtain hung in motionless folds in front of the window. With rapid steps, Adrienne approached it, and with trembling hands lifted the drapery that shrouded the recess. There was only the empty space within; the fading sunset shed its parting beams upon the whitewashed walls, and Adrienne passed her hands over them hoping to discover the means of egress found by the form which had undoubtedly so lately stood there. She then tried the window which opened nearly to the floor, but found that securely fastened. 
               She discovered nothing which could explain this second appearance of the phantom bride, and with a heart that trembled with fear, in spite of her efforts to recover her usual equanimity, Adrienne returned to her seat to reflect on the course it would be best for her to adopt. She tried to nerve her courage anew, but her heart sunk within her at the thought that she must pass the night in the loneliness of her chamber, in a house evidently haunted by the unquiet spirit of its former mistress. 
               The prince slept on; she sat more than an hour with her eyes fixed immovably upon the mirror, hoping yet fearing that the strange vision would again appear; but it did not. With ears sharpened by terror to preternatural acuteness, Adrienne listened for some sound which might betray the vicinity of the pallid bride, but nothing was audible save the heavy breathing of the unconscious sleeper; and after a long struggle with the creeping terror that chilled her to the heart, she summoned courage to rise and grasp the bell-handle. 
               She stood in a state of tremulous agitation, waiting the appearance of Pierre; and to her excited fancy it seemed an age before she heard his lumbering steps stumbling drowsily up the stairs, and through the outer room. He came in half asleep, but even his dull perceptions were struck with the pallor and the expression of affright upon the face of Adrienne. He said: 
               "Hi! young mistis, you look as ef de scare o' stayin' in dis ole haunted place have come 'pon you to-night. Whatever have made you look so white, an' wild, I wonder?" 
                
               Adrienne steadied her voice as well as she could, and replied: 
               "I'm tired and worn out, that is all, Pierre. Will my grandfather come to aid you to-night in your attendance here?" 
               "Oh, yes, ma'm'selle. I ring de bell what 'municates wid his room as I come through de hall, an' he'll come d'rectly. You'd better go, mebbe, befo' de marster comes. I'll hold de canule for you." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               RENUNCIATION. 
               NOT caring to encounter M. Lecour in the state of excitement in which she then was, Adrienne gladly accepted Pierre's offer, and after lighting the candles which stood ready for use, he convoyed her safely through the next room to the head of the staircase. 
               A light had been placed in the lower hall, but she found herself too late to evade her grandfather. She encountered him, looking stern and gloomy as Bluebeard himself, when the secret of the mysterious chamber had been fathomed by his wife, and he abruptly asked: 
               "How is it that the prince has remained awake so much beyond his usual hour? Has your silly prattle kept him from sleeping? This must not occur again, for any change in the regularity of his habits may be injurious to him." 
               "Pardon me, mon pre, the prince has been sleeping more than an hour, but I sat thinking over the strange position in which I find myself placed, and forgot to ring the bell. I promise you it shall not occur again." 
                
               While she was speaking, M. Lecour regarded her with stern significance. He stopped, and slowly said: 
               "Your face is as a mirror which reflects what is passing within you. What have you seen that could produce that expression of fixed terror upon your features? Speak, I demand the truth? What has so alarmed you that you are trembling now in every limb?" 
               Adrienne approached quite near to him, and said, in an impressive whisper: 
               "I have seen the White Terror." 
               If a thunderbolt had suddenly burst at his feet, M. Lecour could not have manifested more alarm. He staggered back, sat down upon a chair, which fortunately happened to be near him, and gazed at her with an expression of incredulous horror. At length he slowly said: 
               "She has really come back, then, for another beside myself has seen her. I have fancied that her apparition was a hallucination of my own mind, produced by the drug I habitually use, for Eady never could see her. Are you sure, child, that you were not dreaming?" 
               "No, no, I was quite awake, and I know that I saw the vailed figure standing in the recess of the window." 
               "How? Did you raise the curtain to let in more light?" 
               "No-it was lifted, I do not know how, and the White Terror stood clearly revealed by the fading light of day." 
               "And the prince? Did he, too, see her?" 
               "He was sleeping soundly. I examined the recess immediately, but I found it empty, and there was no means of egress except by passing through the room in which I was." 
               M. Lecour seemed greatly disturbed. He finally spoke in a deep, hollow voice: 
               "Then this visitation is real, and no vision conjured up by my own phantasies, as I have tried to believe. Oh! it is an awful wrong which enables the dead to come back from the realms of Pluto, and torment him who inflicted it. I tortured her, and she in her turn comes back to torture me. I have doubted the affinity of blood between us, Adrienne. I have fancied that some exchange was made while you were yet in the cradle; but this fellowship in suffering proves to me that you are really my descendant. If it had been otherwise, this vision, which is invisible to my servants, would not have appeared to you. Oh, child! child! the curse of my guilt is upon you." 
               His stern face worked with emotions he rarely permitted to gain the mastery, and the young girl stood mutely before him, the elasticity of her nature seemingly crushed by this blow, and her locked lips refusing to utter comfort or consolation, though if she had attempted to do so, in all probability they would have been repelled with scorn by the hard and fitful nature with which she had to deal. 
               After this unusual burst of remorse, M. Lecour recovered himself. He wiped the beaded moisture from his brow, regained his usual callous composure, and coldly said: 
               "Go to your room, child, and say over every prayer you have ever learned, as a protection from demonology, for demons certainly have sway in this house. I thought their antics were confined to my own apartment, but it seems they have also fastened on you as a victim. Steel your soul against fear if you can do so, and defy them; that will be your only protection." 
               He arose, resumed his usual manner, and hastily brushed past her as he ascended the staircase. 
               Completely unnerved by what had occurred, Adrienne slowly turned towards the corridor that led to her own tower. She suddenly came on Eady, who had evidently been listening to the conversation between herself and M. Lecour. She, too, looked frightened and excited, and she spoke in a flurried manner. 
                
               "I was waitin' for you, young mistis, to come down, dat I may help you off wi' your dress. You aint seen nothin' to scare you in de room up yonder, I hopes." 
               Adrienne abruptly replied: 
               "Yes, I have. I have seen the same figure that came into my room last night, and I conjure you, Eady, if you can explain the mystery of her appearance, that you will do so. I begin to doubt the evidence of my own senses, for I will not believe in supernatural appearances." 
               "But if dey does come, young mistis, an' your own eyes sees 'em, what den?" asked the old woman, with a singular gleam of satisfaction in her eyes. "Dis is mighty strange worl' we lives in, an' I don't pertend to 'count for half what goes on in it." 
               "And do you really believe that the departed wife of M. Lecour is permitted to come back to earth to make wretched the life of a helpless creature like me?" passionately asked Adrienne. "What injury have I ever inflicted on her, that she would make my existence in this place a burden to me?" 
               "You are his child," said Eady, solemnly, "an' de good book says 'de sins o' de fathers shall be visited on de children.' I's sorry tis so, young mistis, but the great Judge knows better'n us poor creeturs," and the speaker crossed her hands, devoutly, and rolled up her eyes in a very effective manner. 
               In the state of mental excitement in which she then was, the idea thus presented to Adrienne was the most terrible that could have been placed before her. She became even paler than before, and sunk down quite overwhelmed, as she murmured: 
               "My grandfather spoke the truth; the ancestral curse is upon me; it will blight and ruin my whole future; I dare not dream of hope, happiness or love, for the expiation due for another's evil deeds must also be required of me, his descendant. Oh, Eady, this is indeed terrible." 
               "Yes, it's very terrible," repeated the negress, in a monotonous tone, like one who had learned her lesson beforehand, and was resolute not to depart from her predetermined course of action. She went on: 
               "Young mistis, you aint in no state to be lef' by yerself, but I ain't got de time to stay wi' you. Please let me help you take off dem fineries, dat I may go down to fix de marster's supper. He'll be tearin' mad ef 'taint ready at de usual time." 
               With a dreary shudder, Adrienne looked around the room, and asked: 
               "Must I stay here all alone to-night, and every night? It is dreadful to think of, for I have invaded the ghost's room, taken possession of her wardrobe, and she will probably return here again as she did last night. Can you not let me go into one of the chambers on your side of the house? I could sleep there without the knowledge of M, Lecour." 
               Eady shook her head. 
               "Not for nothin' would I dar' to let you do sich a thing. He'd find it out to onct, an' den you an' I mought bofe go to kingdom come, in de white rage he'd get inter. In dat state o' his mine, he'd jes' as soon murder us as look at us. Hi! chile, you don' begin to know half de deviltries dat ole man is up to, when he gets in one o' his onreasonable passions. I's seen him in 'em, an' I knows what he can do." 
               While Eady was speaking thus, she was busily engaged in assisting her young lady to disrobe herself; finding the trembling fingers of Adrienne incapable of performing any service for herself, the old woman took down the elaborate structure of her hair before leaving her. With a promise to return with a cup of tea before she retired for the night, she finally left the frightened girl alone. 
                
               Adrienne listened, with an inward shudder, to the departing steps of the negress, and thought of the dreary nights in which she must lie upon that solitary couch, and fancy in every flickering shadow the presence of the White Terror in her room. 
               The question arose in her mind, was she awake in the previous night when the phantom bride appeared in her apartment? was it merely a vivid dream or a weird reality? She must have possessed at least semi-consciousness of what was passing around her, for the experience of M. Lecour had confirmed her own, and now this awful shape had again appeared to her, as if to confirm her belief in the incidents of that terrible night. 
               The education of Adrienne had not fitted her mind to contend successfully against superstitious fears, for she had been taught that miracles are yet of frequent occurrence, and that the spirits of the unquiet dead might, for certain ends, be permitted to leave the realm of shadows, and present themselves as tangible shapes to those who had injured or oppressed them while on earth. Wiser people than herself, admitted that such things were possible, why, then, should she doubt the reality of that vision which her own eyes had twice beheld? 
               Her nervous system had received a shock which prevented her from reasoning correctly; she was very young, extremely sensitive to new impressions, and she suffered with an intensity proportioned to her organization. She sat cowering in her chair, afraid to look around the room, least the phantom shape should again blast her vision, and the grating of the branches against the windows filled her with nameless terrors. 
               Eady at length came in and broke the wretched spell that thralled her senses. She thankfully accepted the tea, which for a wonder, the old woman presented in silence. As she was preparing to go out, she said: 
                
               "I don' know what am a goin' to happen nex', for de marster axed arter you, an tell'd me to say dat he wants you to come to his room afore you go to bed. You'd better fix up your ha'r a little, for it looks kind o' wild, an' you is as white as a ghose yourself." 
               Adrienne aroused herself at this summons. She felt glad of it, for she wished to put a few questions to M. Lecour. She summoned all her courage to her aid, and prepared to obey his commands. She wound her long hair around her head, and wrapping a large shawl over her dressing-robe, proceeded at once to his room. 
               M. Lecour's room was, as usual, gleaming with lights, and the old man himself stood near the fire in an attitude of perturbed thought which Adrienne had remarked in him before. Motioning to her to take a seat near the hearth, he fixed his eyes upon her face, and intently perused every lineament. He seemed struck with the expression of suffering so new to it, but he made no comment upon it. Presently he abruptly said: 
               "Repeat to me exactly what occurred upstairs to-night. You may have dreamed, after all, for one often slumbers unconsciously in a room as quiet as that one was. I think you said that Louis had been sleeping an hour, and you were perfectly still." 
               "That is true, Monsieur, but I was certainly awake, and I could not be mistaken in the actual presence of the white phantom in the room. I saw distinctly the person you described to me this morning." 
               "And yet you could not see her last night? Strange and incomprehensible," he musingly said. 
               Adrienne did not reply to this, for the words of Eady seemed to ring as a warning in her ears, and she feared to acknowledge that she too had beheld the former vision. She suddenly asked: 
                
               "Mon pre, are you sure that your wife is actually dead?" 
               He frowned, his eyes flashed beneath their heavy brows, and his mouth assumed an expression of intense bitterness, as he asked: 
               "What silly fancy has taken possession of your brain, Mademoiselle? Yes-she is surely dead-I saw her in her coffin-I touched her icy hands as they lay folded upon her breast; oh, yes, she is dead-dead-dead, though for some fatal reason, she is permitted to return to this house to render my life a curse. I thought I was well rid of her when the death angel claimed her, for we were not happy together, but I was mistaken, and you too must bear the same crushing burden, because you are of my blood." 
               Adrienne shuddered, and looked up at him so imploringly that even he was moved a little, and it was several moments before he again spoke. His voice was less hard than usual, as he went on: 
               "I wished to speak with you, to say that if this apparition comes again into your presence, give the alarm to me at once. I will overcome the thrilling horror with which it has hitherto inspired me, and come to your side. I will face the phantom when it next visits you, and demand the reason of its appearance. Perhaps I may be able to exorcise it if I speak to it in the name of the great Jehovah." 
               "How shall you be able to do so, if you have no faith in the existence of that mighty One?" asked Adrienne with surprise. 
               "Tush! child; a belief in theological dogmas is very different from that innate conviction in every reasoning being that there is a great first cause, and that this quickening spirit is not an evil one is proved by everything that surrounds us. I have studied books on demonology, and I have gained from them the belief that certain mystic words and ceremonies will banish a haunting spirit. Nay-I have meddled with magic, and tried the sorcerer's art." 
               "And with what results?" asked Adrienne, as he abruptly paused. 
               M. Lecour did not reply for several moments, and when he did it was in a tone of bitter and dreary sarcasm. 
               "I only proved the immutable truth of the wise man's words-'All is vanity and vexation of spirit.' Aye-all-all. Go to bed, Adrienne, and dismiss the singular event of this evening from your mind. Of one thing you may feel assured: Madame Lecour's ghost will do you no harm, for she was neither a malicious nor a vindictive woman during her life, and I scarcely think the change she has passed through can have endowed her with those qualities beyond the grave. It is myself she persecutes, and not you. Sleep, child, in peace, and get rid of that wild look of affright." 
               Adrienne tried to smile in return, but it was a ghastly attempt, and gathering her shawl around her she returned with reluctant feet toward her own apartment. 
               On entering she found that the fire had been replenished, her chair drawn in front of it, and a small stand placed beside it on which lay a package addressed to herself. With irrepressible amazement, Adrienne lifted the letter, and saw the writing of Victor Du Vernay. She quickly broke the seal, and read: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              PARIS, December 5th, 1802.
                            
                           "My adored Adrienne, with what transports I relate to you the singular revolution in my destiny which has occurred since we last parted. My grief at your unlocked for evasion was overpowering, and I believe my father began to fear that his opposition to our union had been carried too far. But fortunately a new and most important phase in our future was suddenly developed. 
                            
                           "Scarcely had the lessening sails which bore you away faded on the horizon, when a letter of most extraordinary tenor came from Louisiana to my father. The writer stated herself to be a most intimate friend of a certain Madame Lecour, who was probably a relative of your grandfather. This lady was in France receiving her education at the time of my birth. She received many civilities from my family, and established herself on such a footing of friendship with them, that at my baptism she officiated as my godmother. Mademoiselle Montreuil returned to Louisiana, where she possessed large estates, and after many vicissitudes, she died, a victim, it was supposed, to the cruelty of her last husband. 
                           "Before her decease, she executed an instrument by which she bequeathed her property to me in trust for one who was infinitely dear to her; but she did not reveal in what relation that beloved one stood to her. It was important that the very existence of her true heir should not be revealed to her surviving husband, as she believed M. Lecour would be unscrupulous in his efforts to remove that person from his path; by a spurious settlement, he had obtained entire possession of her estate, and there was every reason to believe that he would leave no means untried to retain it. 
                           "The time has now arrived when it becomes necessary to secure the rights of the lawful heir, or risk a lawsuit which might last a lifetime. The habits of M. Lecour and his age preclude the idea that he can live many years longer, and unless means are found to dispossess him before his decease, he may dispose of the property in such a manner as would lead to the most vexatious delays before it could be legally claimed by its rightful owner. 
                           "The writer of this letter stated that the will of M. Montreuil, the father of Madame Lecour; was in her own possession, together with ample means to prove its authenticity; and its tenor is such that the estate can never be alienated from his descendants; that the position, name, and residence of the heir are known to her, and would be revealed to me at the proper time. The inheritance she stated to be worth two millions of francs at least, and for the service of claiming and restoring it to its rightful possessor, I was to receive a fourth of its value. 
                           "Think of that, my Adrienne! five hundred thousand francs! It is a magnificent fortune to us. We can be united as soon as it is secured, and be transcendently happy in its enjoyment. 
                           "At first, my father was doubtful about sending me so far away on so slender a chance of success, but my strong desire to pursue the path so singularly opened to me finally prevailed over his scruples. I must say though, that while he remained undecided, a second letter came to him from the same hand, which seemed to fill him with surprise; but of its contents he revealed nothing to me. He merely said that its tenor had changed his views on the subject of the Louisiana estate, and the best thing I could do was to look after the bequest, as he now believed the property might be recovered, and my own portion secured. 
                           "I gladly received this decision, and spoke of you as the reward of my efforts to acquire fortune. He smiled blandly and said: 
                           "'You know, my son, that I have done nothing to thwart your wishes with reference to Mademoiselle Durand, which prudence did not actually compel me to. I simply placed before you the impossibility of marriage without the means of supporting a family; but fortune seems now propitious, and when your legacy is secured, you have my permission to marry this young girl, and I trust you will be happy together.' 
                            
                           "Thus you see, my best loved Adrienne, that the only bar to our union is about to be removed. I shall follow this in a few days, and after obtaining an interview with our correspondent, and taking such steps as will lead to the settlement of this singular testament, I will seek my adored one, and in the sunshine of her smiles find such happiness as is only granted to those who love as purely and tenderly as we do. 
                           "I am somewhat bewildered by the suddenness and the mysterious nature of the communication sent us, but my father, whose judgment is unquestionably sound, seems convinced that all will end well for us, and I am more than willing to trust to him in this crisis of my fate. I have minute directions to call at a certain number on my arrival in New Orleans, and ask for a Madame Noiron who lodges there. She will furnish me with the means of prosecuting such inquiries as are necessary to the perfect comprehension of the services required of me. Be sure I shall lose no time in so doing, and thus place myself au fait to all that my new position may demand. 
                           "Matters once placed in train for a successful termination of the business, and I shall fly to the spot made charming by the presence of my best beloved Adrienne. Write to me to New Orleans, my own one, that I may know how to find you without any unnecessary delay. 
                           
                              "Yours till death, 
                              "VICTOR DU VERNAY."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Adrienne read this exulting letter again and again, and bitter were the tears it wrung from her eyes-intense the anguish it inflicted on her heart. Poor child! she was called on to strike the death-blow to her own prospects, and shrink as she might, she must destroy the vision of happiness which had dawned so brilliantly upon the hopes of her young lover. 
                
               Her grandfather could alone be the person Du Vernay was commissioned to despoil, and in addition to all her other causes of disquiet, her lover was coming to place himself in direct collision with the arbitrary old man, who, she felt, had placed his iron hand upon her fate. Escape from his thraldom she now comprehended to be impossible, for she held a secret M. Lecour considered of vital importance to himself, and she knew that she would never be permitted to give herself to one who came armed with power to strip him of his wealth which he had practised a fraud to gain. Then the burning blush of shame mounted to her brow, and she felt, with inexpressible anguish, that she was the descendant of this man; that his blood flowed in her veins, and Victor, the child of an honorable and true man, would probably shrink from uniting his fate with that of one tainted by such crimes as her grandfather had committed. 
               At all events, she must warn Du Vernay of her near relationship to the old man he was about to despoil, and entreat him to exercise caution and forbearance toward him for her sake. She refolded his letter, and as she replaced it upon the table a note which had escaped her notice fell beneath her eye. It contained a few lines from M. Mendon, which explained the appearance of the package: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MADEMOISELLE DURAND:-I found at the post-office to-day the accompanying letter addressed to you, and I have taken the liberty of taking it out, and forwarding it to you through the hands of Pierre. I hope the speedy proof that your friends over the water have not forgotten you, will brighten your life in the dreary old pile to whose hospitality I so reluctantly consigned you. Remember, Mademoiselle, that you have only to hold out your hand, and it will be cordially grasped, and held forever as a precious treasure by your faithful 
                           
                              "ADOLPHE MENDON."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
                
               With a shudder, Adrienne dropped these lines into the fire, and as the paper blazed up, she chided herself for the feeling of repulsion which dictated the act. M. Mendon had been most attentive to her, and why should his thoughtful kindness in forwarding to her a letter which might otherwise have lain in the obscure little post office unclaimed for many days, be received with such a thrilling sense of aversion? She could not explain it; yet some intuition warned her that he was one of whom she had better beware. 
               Exerting strong self-command, Adrienne compelled herself to look around the room, and seeing nothing, she arose and examined the fastenings of the door, to assure herself that no one could pass through them without her permission. She then prepared to reply to her lover. With an aching heart and unsteady hand she wrote: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "DEAR VlCTOR:-Your letter and its contents should have filled me with delight, for you are coming to me, you have the prospect of wealth before you; but, alas! my evil fate renders this revelation a bitterness instead of a triumph and a joy to me. Alas! alas! I am placed in a wretched position between you and a miserable old man, whose life I vainly hoped to render happier by sharing it. My poor Victor, how will you feel when I announce to you that the M. Lecour you are about to despoil of his ill-gotten wealth is my own grandfather? I know this to be true, for the name of the lady he married leaves me no room for doubt. 
                           "Dear Victor, see what a position I occupy. I sought this old man; I thrust myself upon his hospitality, and demanded of him shelter and protection, as the child of his only daughter; he did not refuse it to me, and I am bound to abide by him in such misfortune as threatens him now. 
                           "When I came hither, I fondly believed that I might render myself useful to him, might soften that rugged nature which had refused forgiveness to his dying child; but now I have no such hope. Yet that conviction does not release me from the duty I feel I have incurred toward this desolate old man. In my favor he relaxed his usual severity, and I feel that I have bound my fortune to his by accepting the shelter of his roof. 
                           "My heart bleeds as I write the sentence, but I know that the decree which separates our lives has gone forth. Follow the clue which leads you to fortune, and does justice to the heir of a most unfortunate lady-for Madame Lecour was certainly such; but in so doing, an impassable barrier must arise between us. I must be true to the duty I have voluntarily assumed, and you must also fulfil the one assigned you. Can you not see yourself that from this point our paths diverge, never more to meet? 
                           "Alas! that it should be so, but inexorable truth places the wretched fact before me, and I must prepare myself for the bitter ordeal through which we are called to pass. 
                           "A fatal curse is upon this sinful old man, and I, as his descendant, must share it. Only to-day I have had a terrible and startling proof of it. He has been a man of violence and blood, and the visible wrath of heaven is upon him. I dare not forsake him, for I feel that I belong to him, and him alone; therefore I entreat you, seek me no more. I free you from your vows-I give you back your troth. 
                           "Since you must ruin and disgrace this hoary-headed man, perform the duty as quietly as possible, that the finger of scorn may not be lifted against the grandchild who was once your promised wife. 
                           "Adieu, Victor. I have tried to write without passion, though I feel in the depths of my soul that I am the victim of the crimes of another, and that other is so nearly bound to me by ties of blood that I dare not repudiate the stain his evil deeds have fixed upon me. I refuse to share the fortune of which he will be stripped, for its loss will break his heart. It is just to reclaim what he should never have appropriated, and I attach no thought of blame to you. Perform your duty, but amid justice remember mercy, for the sake of her who once called herself your
                            
                           
                              "ADRIENNE."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Many times were the blinding tears dashed away while she penned these lines; and at length, exhausted by the various emotions of the day, Adrienne crept into bed, and fell almost immediately into a heavy sleep. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XV. 
               PAULINE. THE QUADROON'S CONFESSION. 
               AFTER the conference with her step-son, recorded in a previous chapter, Madame Crozat re-entered her house, and proceeded toward her own apartment. This room was furnished with what was barely necessary for every-day use; there was a tall, wiry bedstead, which looked as if the posts had been trying to twist themselves into the singular shapes they had finally assumed. On this was a hard mattress covered with dark chintz, which matched the curtains that hung in scanty folds before the windows. The floor was waxed and polished by frequent rubbing, to such a degree as to render it almost as slippery as ice to unpractised feet. A square table was placed in front of the hearth, and an armoire, with spiral ornaments to match the bedstead, stood in a recess beside the fireplace; in the opposite recess was a door leading to a bath-room. The chairs were hard, stiff and angular, and a visitor could see at a glance that the habits of the mistress were far from self-indulgent. 
               Around the table sat four young negro girls, under the direction of a woman of their own race, and the five were occupied in picking the seed from a quantity of cotton that lay heaped up before them. The gin had already been invented, but Madame Crozat had not yet become the proprietor of one, and the small patch of cotton she had cultivated that year was merely an experiment to ascertain if it promised to be more profitable than the indigo which had hitherto been the chief product of the colony. The staple was fine and long, and she had it cleaned under her own supervision, that she might send it to New Orleans, to be judged by those interested in the introduction of this new article of commerce. Little did she think that in less than half a century from this small commencment such vast results would spring. 
               Madame Crozat paused beside the woman, and watched her nimble fingers approvingly as they disengaged the black, unctuous-looking seed from the snowy wool, and she phillipped one of the young girls, who was half asleep, on the side of the head, as she said; 
               "Dullard, see how rapidly Desire works, while you sleep away half your time. Her cotton shall go to New Orleans to be inspected by the factor, and yours shall be used at home to weave clothing and knit stockings." 
               "Hi! I reckon dat's what's gwine to be done wi' all on it, anyhow," responded the girl, with a broad grin, "an' 'taint much differ ef it's spun up here, or in de big town down de riber." 
               "Only that the one who performs her task best will get a red calico dress at Christmas." 
               At this announcement the young girls giggled, straightened themselves up, and one of them replied; 
                
               "I reckon we don' stan' no chance wid Desire, any how." 
               The door leading into the hall suddenly unclosed, and a lady of twenty-five or more, wearing an expression of angry excitement upon her features, entered the room. The contrast between her appearance and that of Madame Crozat was striking. Robes of the richest texture and most brilliant colors adorned her petite person. Her dark, abundant hair was knotted low at the back of the neck, and a few curls fell from the coil. A scarlet bandeau encircled the head, ending with tassels that hung over the left ear. Her complexion was dark as that of a gipsy, and the flash of her black eyes, the haughty curve of her red lips, showed that an imperious nature dwelt within that small frame. She was evidently in a state of intense excitement, and she rapidly said: 
               "Madame mre, I wish to speak with you immediately." 
               "Speak on, then, Pauline," was the tranquil reply. "I am quite ready to listen to you." 
               "Not here, Madame-not here. What I have to say must be said without witnesses. Come to my room, if you please." 
               Madame Crozat shrugged her shoulders, and said: 
               "I will follow you immediately," but her inward thought was: 
               "What new cause of excitement has Pauline found now, I wonder. If I permitted myself to be moved by her caprices, I should never have a moment's peace. Poor child! how she contrives to keep up her feverish excitement in the uneventful routine of a country life, I cannot imagine." 
               After giving a few directions to one of her sable satellites, Madame Crozat slowly crossed a wide hall, and after lightly tapping upon the door, entered the apartment of her step-daughter. 
                
               Here was found every appliance which a luxurious taste could command in those times. Parisian furniture glittered in its finest polish, the windows were draped with hangings of damask, and lounging chairs of various shapes invited to repose, while their owner stood in the centre of the floor, the living incarnation of restlessness. 
               An expression of scornful bitterness wreathed her lip as she said: 
               "Come in, Madame; I only wish to ask you a question that is important to me." 
               "Very well, my daughter, what is it? I am ready to reply to as many questions as you may choose to ask." 
               "Madame, your coldness freezes me, but I see it is assumed for a purpose. You call yourself my mother, and to your care my father bequeathed me, yet you are plotting against me-circumventing me in the dearest wishes of my heart." 
               "I am at a loss to understand you, Mademoiselle." 
               "Indeed! really, you are hard of comprehension, Madame. Who is this strange girl who has come to old Lecour's? and why should you plot with Adolphe to win a nameless stranger for his bride?" 
               "So-well, you are not above listening, I perceive. You could have known nothing of my conversation with Adolphe, unless you had condescended to do so." 
               "When treachery is meditated against me, I do not hesitate to meet it in the same spirit. Yes, I overheard what you said, at first, unintentionally, afterwards, with the determination to learn all I could, and baffle your plans if possible. Who is the girl who came up the river with you? and why should Adolphe listen for a moment to the proposal to make her his wife? His wife! ha, ha! Madame, I thought that honorable position was reserved for me-me, the daughter of your house, as he is the son." 
                
               "You both stand in the same relation to me, Pauline; you are my adopted children, and as such, I have too much regard for your mutual happiness to be willing that you shall be more to each other than you now are. You and Adolphe are not suited to each other; he needs a wife who will soothe his irritability of temper, not increase it as you inevitably would. You should marry a man gifted with the patience of Job, the philosophy of Socrates, and the impassibilty of a Stoic. I bear with you, absurd and disrespectful as your conduct to me often is, because I have steeled myself against anything you may have to say. I have a duty to perform toward you, and I shall endeavor to fulfil it to the best of my ability in spite of your ungrateful conduct. Why you should consider Adolphe as pledged to you, I am at a loss to understand." 
               "Is he not the only eligible match in the circle of my acquaintance? and am I not verging on my twenty-seventh year?" almost shrieked the excited Pauline. "Is it not enough that you have done nothing yourself toward obtaining a suitable settlement for me long ago, but you must interfere where I have set my heart on succeeding?" 
               "Your heart, Mademoiselle, pray leave that out of the question, for it seems to me that the idea of a serious attempt on your part to win M. Mendon is quite new to me. I smile at your reproach against myself; I have been twice married, and I did not require others to do anything toward helping me to gain either of my husbands. If Adolphe had been duly impressed by your charms, he would not have been so easily attracted by this young stranger." 
               The black eyes flashed more disdainfully than ever, and Pauline said: 
               "Madame mre, you sneer habitually at me and my eccentricities, and I have borne with it heretofore, because I thought you really had some regard for me. I know you have read my intention in reference to M. Mendon, and until to visit to New Orleans, I had every reason to believe that you would not attempt to thwart me in their accomplishment. Now your policy is changed; I demand the reason as my right, and I insist on a candid reply. You know a tacit understanding has existed for some time that when my law-suit is settled, I shall bestow myself and the fortune I expect to win upon Adolphe." 
               Madame Crozat made a slight movement of impatience, but she replied, with calmness: 
               "But, Pauline, the last accounts from your lawyer are most discouraging. There is little hope that you will win your cause, and without means on either side, it is simply impossible that Adolphe shall take so expensive a luxury as you would be, in the shape of a wife." 
               The listener clenched her small hands, beat her feet impatiently upon the floor, and asked in a tone half-stifled with rage: 
               "And what fortune has this stranger? Who is she? What is she, that she should he thought fit to supplant me?" 
               "She is the grandchild of M. Lecour, and his presumptive heiress." 
               "Ah, bah! Stuff! Nonsense! That old heathen had no children that I ever heard of." 
               "Not by his last wife, but he was married in France many years before he emigrated to Louisiana; he had an only daughter, and this girl is her child." 
               "Ah! and what guarantee, have you, or M. Mendon that she will inherit a penny of his fortune? M. Lecour is believed to be insane-who can then answer for what he my do with the wealth he has possessed himself of? He may bequeath it to some stranger." 
               "Perhaps we have a remedy for that," replied Madame Crozat, with a mysterious smile. "I think it is certain that Adrienne Durand will ultimately possess his estate, in spite of all that M. Lecour may do to disinherit her." 
               "Then she must have some claim superior to that of relationship to him. You deal in mysteries, Madame; pray unravel this tangled skein, if you please: for I am impatient to understand the true position of this young stranger." 
               "Excuse me, Pauline; I will leave that for your own ingenuity to accomplish. I have listened patiently to your complaint, and I hope you will have self-respect enough to conceal from Adolphe that you had designs upon his hand which he has not sanctioned by any avowal of love on his part." 
               "Madame mre, you know that M. Mendon has devoted himself to me since the death of his wife. He has not spoken of love, because etiquette forbade his doing so till after a certain time has elapsed. If you had permitted affairs to take their natural course, I should have been settled in life before the year is out. I warn you, that I will yet circumvent your plans. I will spare no efforts to unravel the mystery at which you have hinted, and I will use the knowledge I may obtain for my own purposes." 
               "'Forewarned is forearmed,' you know, Mademoiselle," coldly replied Madame Crozat, as she arose from her seat and prepared to leave the apartment. "I trust that you will do nothing to compromise the delicacy of your sex with my son. He has a regard for you as a sister, but it will be something quite new to him to suspect that you wish him to stand in a dearer relation to yourself." 
               Mademoiselle Crozat grew pale with anger as she replied: 
               "The relation would cost him dear, as you have already intimated; but that I hold him dear is a misapprehension on your part. I only condescended to think of him at all because there is no one else to attract. No heart will be broken-no hopes crushed by his devotion to another." 
               "So I thought from the beginning," was the dry response. "You might have spared me this scene, Mademoiselle, for it has led to nothing." 
               "Wait till the end," said Pauline, with a frown as her step-mother left the room. "Yes, wait till the end, Madame, and then see if it is safe to trifle with me. Lonie was my nurse; I can wind her around my finger; and I will see if I, too, cannot fathom this mystery, which seems so important to you and your darling Adolphe. I will see Lonie at once, and judge for myself of her actual condition." 
               Pauline threw a shawl over her head, and, without pausing, went directly to the cottage inhabited by the quadroon. It was not situated in the quarter appropriated to the negroes that worked on the place; a small cabin had been built for her in the lower part of the large garden; and the visitor walked hastily toward a clump of orange trees that grew around it. The humble roof was nearly covered with creeping vines, which formed a tangled network over its surface, and hung in long wreaths from the rustic portico in front of the house-for Lonie had endeavored to impart to the home afforded her an appearance of refinement, acquired by her long sojourn in France. The door stood open, for the evening was bright and warm, and the soft air was pleasant to the sick woman within. The young lady entered and approached the bed, on which lay a tall woman, whose complexion was scarcely darker than her own, in spite of the dash of colored blood in her veins. Like those of nearly all her caste, her form was remarkable for symmetry, and her wasted features had once possessed uncommon beauty. Lonie was now past the meridian of life, but the fire of her large black eyes was still unquenched, and the hair that fell in disordered, waving masses upon her pillow, was scarcely threaded with gray. 
               She was lying quite still, with her eyes wide open, and her lips slightly apart, as if every breath of fresh air was eagerly inhaled to allay the feverish unrest that parched her system and drained her life. Pauline looked down upon her, and seeing that she made no motion, she spoke softly, using the term of endearment to which her childish lips had been accustomed. 
               "Maumer, how is it with you? I trust you are not so very ill." 
               The woman started, threw out her hand and muttered: 
               "Ill? Ill? who says I am ill? I shall be up to-morrow. You won't have me sent away, my darling? I can't die away from you; you're all I have now, and I love you, my pet." 
               "Who spoke of sending you away, poor Lonie? No one would be so cruel. I have come to sit with you awhile. Let me give you some drink." 
               She held a cup to the parched lips, and the woman eagerly swallowed the orange leaf tea with which it was filled. She sunk back, and said: 
               "It was only a wretched dream, then. I thought Mademoiselle Louise came in here, and told me that I should be cast into the road for my treachery to her. Oh! it was long, long ago, but its memory is with me now; and it withers-it scorches my heart, It was base-base--" 
               Lonie continued to mutter, but the listener could make nothing from her disjointed rambling. She questioned her in every way to bring her back to the point from which she had started, but in vain. Her mind had utterly wandered from it, and Pauline listened half impatiently to her incoherent ravings, till the physician who had been summoned arrived. 
                
               Dr. Brunei examined the condition of his patient, shook his head, and looked ominous. Madame Crozat had followed him into the cabin, and she inquired, with much solicitude: 
               "Is there any real danger to be apprehended, doctor?" 
               "She is in a very critical state, Madame; and I consider her recovery extremely doubtful." 
               She then inquired: 
               "Will Lonie regain entire possession of her senses before she dies?" 
               "In ordinary fevers that is usually the course, but in this case the symptoms are extremely unfavorable. She may die in a state of congestion, and be unable to speak at all. Is her life particularly valuable, Madame?" 
               "To me it is," replied Pauline, before her mother could speak. "Lonie was my attendant from my seventh year, and she has been almost a mother to me. Save her if you can, Dr. Brunei, and I will thank you with my whole heart." 
               "I will do my best, Mademoiselle; but the chances are bad. The fever should have been taken at the start-now it is almost unmanageable." 
               "Had I been at home you would have been summoned at once," said Madame Crozat, emphatically. 
               Pauline flushed at the implied reproach, and said: 
               "Lonie did not complain or lie down till yesterday. I had no idea that she was seriously ill. At all events I will not fail in my duty to her now. If Madame mre will permit me, I will remain near, her, and assist in nursing her myself." 
               Madame Crozat regarded her with an expression of surprise, for she had thought Pauline too self-indulgent to undertake such a duty, even for the nurse who had been faithful to her through long years of service. She said: 
                
               "That would be something entirely new for you to undertake, my daughter. Desire is an experienced nurse, and I will send her to wait upon Lonie." 
               "Excuse me, Madame, but I prefer remaining myself," replied Pauline with resolute emphasis. "Lonie has nursed me through many hours of illness, and it is surely my place to attend to her in this extremity." 
               Madame Crozat steadily regarded her step-daughter as if endeavoring to fathom her motives; but in her heart she believed her too shallow to have any. She had forgotten that portion of her conversation with M. Mendon which referred to this woman and her former connection with the Montreuil family; and she began to feel that some natural feeling of gratitude moved the heart of Pauline to perform for a faithful servant the last kindness she would probably need on earth. After a moment's hesitation, she said: 
               "You can do as you wish, I shall not thwart you in so useful a duty. Remain with Lonie if it is your desire to do so, but I shall also send Desire to assist in nursing her." 
               Pauline assented to this arrangement, and the negress soon came to apply the remedies ordered by the physician. 
               The most active treatment was resorted to, but without avail-the woman hourly sunk, and on the evening of the fourth day from her seizure, she was evidently dying. The two who nursed her had kept a constant watch upon her; one to discover the secret for her own behoof, the other to obey the stringent commands of her mistress not to lose a syllable that fell from the lips of the distraught creature. 
               On the evening of the fourth day, Desire was nearly worn out with watching, and the labor that had been chiefly borne by her, while her young lady had rested many hours in the large cushioned chair she had caused to be brought from her own room to the cabin. 
                
               The curiosity of Pauline was sharpened by what had fallen from the sick woman's lips in her delirious ravings. Lonie dwelt only upon the incidents of her early life, and the revelations she made were of a character to arouse a strong desire to fathom the wicked past which now clouded her last moments with fear and anguish. 
               The heavy breathing of the sick woman filled the room as she lay in a perturbed slumber. The head of the wearied black fell upon the foot of the bed, and in a few moments she slept so deeply that it would have taken force to awaken her. 
               At that crisis, Pauline aroused herself, left the chair in which she had been coiled up, and looked upon the being whose soul was so rapidly flitting to another world. She had lost all hope the Lonie would recover consciousness, and the thought crossed her mind that it was time to summon the priest to perform the last rites of the church for her. 
               As she turned with the purpose of doing so, the large eyes of the dying woman suddenly unclosed, and looked around with intelligence in their glance. She feebly said: 
               "My darling, is it indeed you? I have been very ill, I believe, for I feel weak and sinking-sinking. Have you stayed by me all the time?" 
               "Yes, dear Maumer, who should nurse you, but your own Pauline? You are better-I am so glad that you know me again." 
               The woman looked wistfully at her, and slowly said: 
               "I am dying, I fear, for I feel as if the earth is crumbling away beneath me." 
               "That is because you are so weak. Here is wine the doctor ordered for you, if you awoke in your senses." 
               "Give it to me; I want strength to talk. I have much to tell the priest; let him come to me." 
                
               "Father Eustace left home this morning, and has gone no one knows whither. He will probably not be back before night. Make me your confessor, Lonie, for it will ease your mind to tell some one of the wrong that weighs upon it. Besides, it may be useful to me; your ravings have already partially revealed to me events, which if fully in my possession, would be of material use to me. Can you not speak the whole to me exactly as you would to the priest if he were here?" 
               Lonie regarded her with a startled expression. She was still under the influence of fever, and she said with a ghastly smile: 
               "And you really seek to become my confessor? Will you give me absolution for my crime? Can you ask pardon for me in that world to which I am hastening? Oh! my pretty one, it will be a sad tale for you to hear from the lips of your old Maumer." 
               "Never mind that; tell it to me, for it may be important to my future welfare to know it. I wish you to understand me, Lonie; you can serve me by relating to me the story of Louise Montreuil. I must hear it, for the happiness of my whole life is vitally concerned in knowing the events of her early career. 
               Lonie opened her wild eyes, and stared vaguely at her. Her mind was affected by the opiates which had been administered to her, and she obeyed the voice that commanded her to speak, with the flickering idea that she was confessing to the priest. Her eyes half closed, as if weary of light, and she rambled on: 
               "You wish me to speak of my first mistress. The beautiful Louise, the fascinating Louise, the rich Louise. Ha! ha! she was all these, but she was not the happy Louise-no-no-no." 
               There was another interval of wandering, and then she went on: 
                
               "I grew up with her. I was her little maid when she was six years old, and I was ten, for I was the eldest. She taught me to read as she learned herself; she loved me, and she believed that I loved her too; but I did not-no, I did not." 
               She paused, and seemed about to slumber again, but Pauline aroused her by asking: 
               "Why did you not love her, Maumer? She was kind to you, and I cannot think you would be otherwise than faithful to her. See what you have been to me." 
               "You-you! Oh, you were a little child, thrown on me for care; but she was young, beautiful, and beloved, in those days of vanity when I yearned for all that she was endowed with, and envied her its possession. Oh, yes! I was bitterly envious of this gentle mistress of mine, and I am afraid I too eagerly embraced the chance to ruin her happiness." 
               "You accompanied Mademoiselle Montreuil to Paris, I believe; tell me about that," said Pauline, to induce her to continue her narrative. 
               "Yes; I went with her to her convent where her education was finished. They let me in as an humble boarder, that I might be near my young mistress; and there I picked up education enough to make me fully aware of the wide gulf between Mademoiselle Louise and myself." 
               "In the same house there was a young lady, called Estelle Lecour, who was the intimate friend of my young mistress; and the Superior permitted herself to be persuaded to allow the young ladies to go on a visit to the family of Monsieur Du Vernay, a friend of M. Montreuil's. 
               "At his chateau they met with the twin brothers Durand, and the imprudent girls became desperately enamoured of them. Mademoiselle Estelle knew that she was destined to take the vail, and my young mistress had been betrothed from her infancy to the son of one of her father's oldest friends, and to him she knew M. Montreuil was resolute to give her. Ah! she also knew that he was a violent man, a determined one, and he would shrink from nothing that promised him the fulfillment of a wish on which he had set his heart. It was that which led her into such a disobedient course. She thought if she was once married, her fate would be beyond his control. Poor thing! she little dreamed of what wrong he was capable." 
               Leonie paused as if exhausted, and Pauline offered her more wine, as she said: 
               "Go on, Maumer. It is as good as a romance. I'm deeply interested. Did those girls marry their lovers?" 
               "Ah, yes. In an evil hour for both, they were clandestinely united to them. The two were married on the same night by the same priest, and after a brief taste of wedded happiness, they returned to their convent to await the result of the application made to their parents for consent to the unions which had already taken place." 
               "And what was the result?" 
               "Estelle was permitted to go forth with her husband, with the curse of her father as her only dower, to live in poverty and repentance, though I believe she did not live long to bear it." 
               "And Louise? It is of her I most wish to hear." 
               "It is a sad story when you do hear it. As her father was in Louisiana, it was three months before he could be heard from; but such a letter as did come at last, might well make any poor girl tremble and grow heart-sick. He utterly refused his consent to the proposed union, and commanded the Superior to keep a constant watch upon his daughter, as he would hold her responsible for her safety. Ah! it was too late then! The tie had been woven, the vows had been spoken, that made her a wife, and her heart clung to the man to whom she had pledged her faith. 
                
               "M. Durand refused to submit to her father's decision; he had a small property of his own, and he declared that he would labor to increase it. She should never know want if she would trust herself to him. He demanded her as his wife, and unless she refused to go with him, there was no power to retain her vested in her protectors. 
               "I hope she consented, though I know of course she did." 
               "Yes, she elected to go with him, and they took possession of the humble cottage he had inherited, for although of noble blood, the family was an impoverished one, but my mistress was very happy, for M. Durand was a gentleman, and he was devotedly attached to his young wife. I did not envy her then, although she was wedded to the choice of her heart, for she had relinquished for him the very things that made her lot desirable in my estimation-the power of wealth and high position, and the admiration of society. These were what I yearned to possess, and I regarded her infatuation with contemptuous pity. She seemed to have no fears for the future, but I knew her happiness could not last-no, no, it could not last." 
               She paused as if recalling old memories, and Pauline impatiently asked: 
               "What happened then? Did the imperious father come and tear her from him by force?" 
               "Oh, no, he knew better than to attempt that, but he did far worse. M. Montreuil belonged to a family who possessed great power in France; he wrote to one of his kinsmen to obtain a sealed order for the arrest of M. Durand as a dangerous political person, and to have him thrown into prison without the knowledge of any one connected with him. They did such things in those days, and I afterwards learned that M. Durand was thrown into the Bastile, where he lay in one of the underground cells for eight long years. When that building was torn down, he was rescued from it, a broken, white-haired man." 
               "And where was his wife during all that time?" 
               "Let me tell you in my own way, for my head is a little confused. M. Durand was summoned to Paris, to attend to some business which was represented as important. His wife could not accompany him, because her infant was scarcely two weeks old. He placed her under my care, and left with the assurance of a speedy return. When he failed to come, and day after day passed without any news from him, the uneasiness of my mistress became terrible. She could not leave her sick room to go in search of him, and she confided this task to me, as one who was interested in her happiness. I departed in good faith for I had no idea of the treachery I was afterwards induced to practice toward her. 
               "When I reached Paris, I found my master there. He had followed his letter to see that his wishes were executed; from M. Montreuil I heard such bitter denunciations of his son-in-law, as made me tremble for my poor young mistress and her helpless little babe. When he heard of the infant, I thought he would have gone wild. He said: 
               "'The father is safe enough, and now I must deal with the brat. Louise shall never take such an evidence of her shame to my home, for it is my unfaltering resolve that she shall yet become the wife of Eugene Mendon. I have promised it, and I am not the man to break my word. 
               "M. Montreuil then developed his plan of action to me, and demanded my co-operation. He offered me a bribe which I had not strength to refuse. Freedom, and a sufficient annuity to support me in comfort, were the terms, if I would aid him in imposing on his daughter the nefarious story he had prepared. He had caused her husband to be imprisoned, he believed for life; his object now was to traduce M. Durand to his wife, and lead her to believe that she had been deceived into uniting her fate with that of a man who already claimed another wife. A woman was hired to personate that wife, a forged contract was shown to my mistress, and I falsely swore that I had seen M. Durand meet this woman, and heard him address her as his darling Marie. I asserted that I was afraid to inform my mistress at the time it occurred, lest I should incur the anger of her supposed husband. M. Durand had doubtless deserted her in her turn, and was now deceiving some other trusting heart as easily as he had deceived hers. 
               "Ah! when I witnessed her pale despair, my heart almost relented from its cruel purpose; but I dared not disobey my master; if I had only known where M. Durand was to be found, I might have betrayed the base plot to her. But what good could come of undeceiving her then, when I believed her husband had been made way with by her father in some underhand manner? My young mistress had nothing to live on, and her father was now her only hope, so I thought it best to hold my peace." 
               "And where was M. Durand's brother and his wife, that they did not come to her, and prove the falsehood of this calumny?" 
               "The poor young wife did come, bringing with her a feeble wailing baby a few weeks older than our little one; but her husband had been compelled to leave her shortly after their marriage, and go to South America. Her father would give them nothing, and M. Julien Durand went to Rio Janeiro to look after some property bequeathed to him by an uncle who had been a merchant there. 
               "M. Montreuil bade me prepare the mind of my mistress to relinquish her child. He vowed that it should never go with her to Louisiana, for he was determined that this wretched and disgraceful portion of her history should never be known in her native colony. If she refused to part from the infant, he declared that he would abandon her to absolute penury. 
               "During all this time, M. Montreuil had not visited his daughter. He left her to her misery and fancied degradation, till she was in a fit state to listen to his overtures; and then he came to her. He played the part of the forgiving and affectionate father, but he refused utterly to look upon the innocent face of his grandchild. No alternative was allowed her; the infant must be given up. His daughter must return with him to her paternal home, but she could not carry back with her the evidence that she was a mother, without having legally been a wife. It was an awful struggle, but the tyrannical father conquered, as he knew he must from the beginning." 
               "And what became of the child?" 
               "Madame Julien Durand took charge of it, with the promise of a suitable provision for it from M. Montreuil, for he was lavish enough of his money when things went to suit him." 
               "I know what happened afterwards. Louise came back to Louisiana, and gave her hand to M. Eugene Mendon; but how did her father dare to permit such a marriage, when he knew her first husband was living! How could she consent, after all that had happened to her?" 
               "If you had known her father, Mademoiselle, you would not ask such questions. He always carried his point, either by fair means, or by force. I did not return to this country with my mistress, for I wished to enjoy my new freedom, and the comfortable annuity my treachery had purchased; so I stayed in Paris, and led a very gay life with those who were as fond of pleasure as I was, and not above sharing my prosperity, although I belonged to a caste inferior to their own. 
                
               "I occasionally heard from my old home, and after my return to Louisiana, I heard the whole story of those days at Bellair. My young mistress was forced to dress, dance, entertain company, and finally she was induced to give her hand to the young planter to whom she had been promised from her cradle. Her first dream was past; and she expiated her disobedience to her father, by complying with his wishes so soon as her wounded heart could bear the acceptance of a second lover." 
               "And were they happy together?" 
               "I believe they were passably so. I am sure that my young lady did not deceive M. Mendon. I believe he married her with a full knowledge of her early misfortune, for she was too true and noble in her nature to have carried such a secret locked in her bosom, when she gave him her hand. When I returned to Louisiana with your father as your attendant, M. Montreuil and his chosen son-in-law were both dead, and the unhappy widow had been mad enough to marry that dreadful old man who now lives at Bellair. M. Lecour kept her shut up in her own house, and he positively refused me admittance when I sought an interview. But I baffled him at last; and I succeeded in seeing Madame Lecour once before her death. God knows if that interview hastened it, but I have sometimes feared that it did, for I then told her of the treachery I had practised, and the great wrong her father had perpetrated against her. She listened to my terrible story with a degree of apathy I should once have deemed impossible with her. She told me, that she had already found the record of these events among her father's private papers, but too late to save her from the fatal step she had taken in her last union. She had also found there the certificate of Henri Durand's death which had been forwarded to M. Montreuil only a few months before her union with her second husband. 
                
               "I was confounded at this assertion, for I knew that M. Durand was not then dead; but I did not tell her. It would have been a useless piece of cruelty, for this poor lady could then have done nothing to rescue herself from the miserable position in which she was placed. In a week from that day, it was known through the country that Madame Lecour was dead, and had bequeathed the whole of her fine fortune to her husband." 
               "How did it happen that you came back with us? Why did you not stay in Paris and enjoy life?" 
               "Things began to get too unsettled in France. The great Revolution was approaching, and I feared for my life. I witnessed the destruction of the Bastile, and while I stood among the crowd, a man, who had just been rescued from its dungeons, staggered up and spoke to me. I thought him an utter stranger, for his hair was white as snow, and his body was wasted to a skeleton. He asked me for his wife and child, and I knew him then from the sound of his voice. At first I was afraid to answer him, but the poor creature had been too long dead to all emotion to betray much then and there. I took him to my lodgings, and after a scene that makes me shiver now when I recall it, I gradually made M. Durand understand what had happened. 
               "I concealed from him my own agency in the deception practised on his wife, but told him how she had been induced to believe he had abandoned her. I informed him of the second marriage of Mademoiselle Montreuil, and entreated him to leave her in peace. His appearance on the scene could now only embitter his life, and fill her heart with remorse toward him and resentment toward her father. 
               "He listened to me, admitted the truth of my words, and then went his way. I never saw him again, and I think it probable his dead body was found in the morgue before the week was over. 
                
               "The bankers with whom my money was placed failed, and I was glad to hire myself to nurse your mother in her last illness. We went to Madeira for the winter, and when she died there, she entreated me to remain with you. I came on to Louisiana, glad to get back once more to my old home, although I found everything changed there. My annuity died with my old master, and for years I have been only permitted to remain upon this place as a favor accorded me by your father's second wife. As the plantation was her property when she married him, I should feel grateful even for the permission to remain near you, the darling of my heart. See how I have talked on, solely to gratify your wish, although I know that every moment my life is ebbing from me." 
               Pauline pressed her hand, as she said: 
               "You have done me a real service, Maumer, and I thank you for it. Your voice is stronger, your eyes brighter, since you commenced your narrative. Ah, I don't believe you will die yet awhile, for I cannot spare you." 
               "I have exhausted the little life left in me, in obeying your wish to hear this miserable story. It is finished, and with it my span of existence. Call Father Eustace, my child-quick-quickly let him come, for I am failing fast." 
               Her face became so ghastly as she spoke, that Pauline was alarmed, and roused Desire with much effort to go and ascertain if the priest had returned from a visit he had set out to make in the early part of the day. It was now twilight, and after a brief absence the negress returned, accompanied by Father Eustace. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               TWO UNSCRUPLOUS MEN CONSPIRE TOGETHER. 
               LEONIE sunk so rapidly that there was barely time to perform the last rites of the church before life departed. To the last she grasped the hand of Pauline, and died with her failing eyes fixed upon her face. 
               Madame Crozat came in as soon as she heard of the imminent crisis in which the sick woman lay. She seemed anxious and disappointed, and finally whispered to Desire an inquiry as to what had been revealed. Of course, the black had nothing to tell, for she had slept through the whole conversation, and Pauline secretly exulted that for once she had baffled her acute stepmother. She thought: 
               "The clue is mine, and I will soon give it in the hand of the old ogre at Castle Dismal to unwind. Then I shall see a pretty row, and I will sit behind the curtain, and pull the strings which will move the human puppets who thought to circumvent me." 
               She shed a few tears over the lifeless form of her nurse and then retired to the solitude of her own room, to meditate upon her plans. That Adrienne was the daughter of Louise Montreuil she had at once made up her mind, and as such she must become an object of dread and suspicion to M. Lecour. She could not discover any reason for the exchange of children, but that it had been made she would not permit herself to doubt. She was resolute to inform the master of Bellair of what she believed, let the consequences be what they might. 
               Narrow-minded, high-tempered, and unscrupulous, Pauline would not think of the dangerous position in which the young stranger would be placed if she was discovered to be the legal heir to his fortune while she was yet entirely in the power of this lawless old man. She thought only of her own interests, and they would be best served by the removal of Mademoiselle Durand from her path, and it really concerned her very little by what means it was accomplished. 
               Pauline finally seized a pen, and wrote the following lines: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MONSIEUR LECOUR:-I address this to you without the knowledge of any human being, to warn you that your worst enemy is now harbored beneath your roof. The young girl who has come to you as your grandchild is really the daughter of your last wife by her first husband, M. Henri Durand, to whom she was clandestinely married, while in France, twenty years ago. 
                           "This information has come to my knowledge through the confession of a quadroon woman who died on Madame Crozat's place about an hour ago. Lonie was once the personal attendant of Mademoiselle Montreuil; she accompanied her to France, and was under the same roof with her during the year that she lived with M. Durand as his wife; she was present when the child of that marriage was transferred to Madame Julien Durand to be reared as her own. That the young girl now with you is that child, is beyond a doubt. 
                           After her separation from her young mistress, Lonie became my nurse, and came with me to Louisiana after the death of my mother. I was with her to the last, heard her confession of these facts, and hasten to transmit them to you. Use them to your own behoof, but conceal from every one the scource from which they were derived. 
                           "I give you my name, that you may attach credence to my information; but I trust to your honor to make no use of it that can in any way compromise me with my stepmother and her son. I am certain they are plotting to make this girl the wife of M. Mendon, and thus at last secure the estate they have so long coveted. 
                           
                              "PAULINE CROZAT."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               How to send this epistle to its destination, was the next consideration. After a few moments' thought, Pauline concluded to take the eldest son of M. Mendon into her confidence, and make him its bearer. This lad had an aversion to the idea of a stepmother, which amounted almost to a mania; and she knew that to give him a hint of his father's intentions with respect to Adrienne, would be to enlist him at once in her own service. 
               She had scarcely finished the letter, when Madame Crozat came into her room. She looked surprised when she saw the open desk, and suspiciously said: 
               "You do not usually write so late, Mademoiselle. May I inquire the nature of your correspondence?" 
               "Certainly; it is only an order to the store for a package of mine, which was not sent with the last things that came from New Orleans. My shoes were in it, and I need them. Eugene is going over to-morrow morning, and I thought I would get him to deliver it." 
               "I did not know that Eugene contemplated such a trip," was the careless reply. "I think Father Eustace permits him to leave his studies too frequently of late, and I shall speak to Adolphe about it." 
               "Do as you please, after to-morrow, Madame; but I do not wish you to prevent him from going this time, for I am in need of my shoes." 
               "And there may be letters, too. Another boat came last night, I heard; so, for this time Eugene can go, as all the men on the place are busy getting the ground ready for the new crop." 
                
               Thus spoke practical Madame Crozat, entirely unconscious that by this concession she put in jeopardy not only the interests that were of vital importance to M. Mendon, but also endangered the very existence of the helpless girl whose hand she had hoped would endow him with fortune. After a few moments' silence, Madame Crozat said: 
               "I regret the death of Lonie at his particular crisis, because she could have given me information that would have been extremely useful to me. Did anything that was rational escape her before her death? Desire assures me that she never awoke from her delirium, but she was evidently so stupid from want to sleep, the I can scarcely rely on her word." 
               Pauline steadily regarded her a few seconds, and then asked: 
               "Do you really expect me to reveal to you what Lonie said?" 
               "Of course, or I should not have asked it. Your assertion that you would use such discoveries as you might make for your own purposes, I regarded as mere idle words. If you wish success in any of your plans, you had better confide in me, for alone, you must always fail." 
               "I am already aware, Madame, that you think I have too little sense to manage my own affairs. Well-I will be humble for once, and admit that you may be right. Lonie did have an interval of sanity before her death: she may not have been quite in her right mind, for she told me a most singular story; but she spoke in a collected manner, and I am inclined to believe she understood what she was saying." 
               Madame Crozat betrayed the most vivid interest. 
               "what was the nature of this revelation? Did she refer to her residence in Paris? To the history of her first mistress, Louise Montreuil?" 
                
               "She did, Madame mre. She spoke only of her." 
               "And what did she reveal?" was the eager question that followed. 
               "That which will dash all your plans to fragments, if you believe that the young girl at Castle Dismal is the child of Mademoiselle Montreuil. The daughter of Henri Durand and Louise, was transferred to Estelle Lecour, who was the wife of his brother, to be reared as her own child; but she died in her infancy, and the young girl you had hoped would turn out to be the heiress, is only the granddaughter of old Lecour after all." 
               While Pauline uttered this invention she looked steadily at the disappointed face of her step-mother. Madame Crozat seemed quite crestfallen. She asked: 
               "Are you sure that this is the truth, Pauline? Yet how should you have known anything of these affairs if Lonie had not revealed them to you? Repeat to me exactly what she said." 
               With the cunning inherent in mean natures, Pauline used the narrative of Lonie in such a manner as to lead the stepmother to believe she had actually heard from the lips of the dying woman the story she related to her. Facts already known to Madame Crozat, were so cleverly mingled with fiction, that it was impossible for the listener to separate them, and most unwillingly did she arrive at the conclusion that Adrienne was really the descendant of M. Lecour. The resemblance she bore to his deceased wife was most remarkable; but that must be accidental; and with a sigh she beheld her magnificent chateaux en espagne crumble into ruins. 
               The question in her astute mind now was, would it be to the interest of M. Mendon to marry Adrienne, or to await the issue of Pauline's law suit? for she was by no means hopeless of success in it, although she had spoken so disparagingly agingly of it to that young lady. M. Lecour she knew would never give his consent to the union of his granddaughter with Adolphe Mendon, and without it she would be a beggar, for he would surely disinherit her. Perhaps after all, Pauline, with her chance to win a fortune of fifty thousand dollars from an unsettled claim belonging to her father's estate, would be a better speculation for M. Mendon than the other. It was true, Pauline was silly, and bad-tempered, but his firmness might remedy her worst faults, and besides she was really bound to consider the interests of one so nearly connected with herself. She thought it best to change her tactics for the present at least, and she conciliatingly said: 
               "You must forget what I have said to you this morning, my daughter. You provoke me at times to say harsh things, but I always regret them afterwards. Now I comprehend your wishes, I hesitate to array myself against them; if your suit goes right, it will perhaps be best that you and Adolphe should marry. There will be then no heart-burnings about the division of my estate after I have passed from the scene. I have always intended that it shall belong equally to you." 
               Pauline took her hand, and raised it to her lips with theatrical emphasis. 
               "Thanks, Madame mre; now I know you again as my true mother. I began to doubt your love for me, and it pained me inexpressibly. Yes-my suit will give me wealth-I know it will, and Adolphe will give me his hand in exchange for it. Thus we shall again become an united family." 
               Madame Crozat permitted this, nay, she confirmed the hollow truce by lightly touching the brow of Pauline with her lips. There was no warmth in the caress, but the fair schemer received it for what it was worth, and exulted in the belief that for once, her cunning had proved more than a match for her clear-sighted step-mother. 
               Madame Crozat left the room, and Pauline prepared to carry out her plan. She watched for Eugene as he passed her door on his way to the cottage which the boys occupied with their tutor. He was alone, and Pauline stood ready to intercept him. Calling him in, she soon enlisted the boy in her scheme, and he promised to deliver the letter to old Pierre. 
               When she left the apartment of her step-daughter, Madame Crozat at once sought M. Mendon, to reveal to him the substance of what she had gathered from Pauline. Together they canvassed the chances of Adrienne to succeed to the Montreuil estate, and both reluctantly came to the conclusion that they were small indeed if she was really the descendant of M. Lecour, They too well understood his vindictive and mean nature, to believe that he would ever endow the child of his discarded daughter with the wealth he had appropriated. They had no doubt that it was his intention to atone for the base and grasping manner of its accumulation, by giving it to some mammoth charity at his decease; thus hoping to wipe out in some measure the infamy of its acquisition. 
               The conference ended by the lady saying: 
               "Pauline's suit is not absolutely desperate, and she may yet prove worth looking after. A moderate certainty is better than a brilliant promise which may bring nothing but disappointment. I fancy the blood of old Lecour would not be exactly the only inheritance you would be willing to take with his grand-daughter. She is very fair and attractive, but if he gives her no fortune, she is no match for you." 
               M. Mendon looked ill pleased. He coldly said: 
               "Pauline is well enough as a step-sister, but this young girl has really fascinated me. I would give much to believe lieve her the daughter of my deceased sister-in-law, and so wonderful is the resemblance between them that I felt almost assured of the fact." 
               "I also believed it, but Lonie knew the history of her mistress well, and when dying she would scarcely have misrepresented incidents she took a part in." 
               Although Madame Crozat was fully aware of the intriguing temper of her step-daughter, and her wide variations from the truth when it suited her purpose to prevaricate, yet in this instance she did not once suspect that Pauline had invented the most important portion of the story she had related to her. She had a feeling of contempt for her, mingled with that attachment which is the result of habit, and the sense of responsibility that had grown out of their mutual relations. At the period of her union with M. Crozat, Pauline was an engaging child of nine summers, who soon made a place for herself in the heart of the childless woman. Years did not deepen that attachment, for the traits developed by the girl as she grew to womanhood were many of them repulsive to her, but there were still some points of sympathy which prevented Madame Crozat from becoming entirely alienated. 
               A marriage between Mademoiselle Crozat and her darling Adolphe was not a favorite idea with her, but if he could do no better, he must be contented with Pauline and her fortune, whenever it was won. After musing several moments, M. Mendon abruptly asked: 
               "Will it not be well to take Father Eustace in our confidence? From some things that have escaped him, I believe that he has been sent hither as a spy on M. Lecour. If he possesses any hold on him, he may aid us in getting him in our power so completely that we may be able to dictate our own terms to him." 
               After a moment's reflection, Madame Crozat replied: 
                
               "Act as you may think for the best, my son. 'A drowning man catches at straws,' and if there is any chance to save this fine inheritance, and at the same time win a beautiful bride, do not throw it away from a few scruples of conscience. The priest may be of use to you, if you will offer him a sufficient reason." 
               "Oh, I understand that part of the negotiation very well. Since his last visit to Bellair, Father Eustace has been shy and morose. He pretends to have taken offence at a proposal I made to him, and I can get nothing that is satisfactory out of him. He has absented himself the greater part of to-day, and I have a suspicion that he went thither again; for what purpose I know not, as M. Lecour would not receive him so soon after his last visit; he must have seen Mademoiselle Durand, and made an appointment to meet her to-day, without the knowledge of her grandfather. I would do much to enlist him heartily in my interests." 
               He arose as he spoke and prepared to go out to the cottage occupied by the priest and the two lads. M. Mendon found Father Eustace sitting over his lamp, with a ponderous volume open before him, but he was evidently not engaged in studying the learned lore found upon its pages. His compressed lips, sternly knit brows, and angry expression showed that he was in a most excited and perturbed state of mind. 
               As M. Mendon entered he looked hurriedly around, and spoke with marked hauteur. 
               "I trust that you will excuse my absence to-day, Monsieur, for I presume that is what has brought you hither, at this unusual hour. The journey I went on was important to me, though it only ended in disappointment. The lads had their studies assigned them before I left them." 
               "Settle those matters with Madame Crozat," replied M. Mendon, easily. "I do not trouble myself about a few extra holidays to the boys. No, father, I seek you on a matter of much deeper significance to me. You have evaded me for the last few days, but I have sought you now to learn positively what chance there is for obtaining your assistance in the matter we spoke of." 
               A bitter smile passed over the face of the priest, and he sharply said: 
               "Yes, I will help you, but it must be on my own terms. You may cast hope in that quarter to the winds, unless you, in your turn, will aid me to accomplish the task that brought me to this country." 
               "Only show me how I can help you, and I am ready to pledge myself to do so." 
               Father Eustace regarded him in silence several moments; he then impressively said: 
               " M. Mendon, my confidence involves a secret of vital importance to many persons, and a binding oath will be demanded of you to maintain it at all hazards to yourself." 
               "I shall not shrink from the responsibility." 
               "Will you swear by all that is most sacred to you, that you will keep this revelation forever untold? Not even in the confessional, when death stands beside your pillow, must you betray it. Do this, and I bind myself to your interests." 
               "I am ready to take any oath you may dictate, and abide by it, if Adrienne Durand and the Montreuil estate are to be the reward of my fidelity; and now I am ready for your secret." 
               "You forget the oath, Monsieur. That must be taken with a degree of solemnity hitherto unknown to you." 
               He took a bible from the table, opened the leaves, and reverently placed upon it a cross, and repeated a form of adjuration so solemn, so awful, that even the world-hardened man who repeated it after him, shivered with superstitious terror at the mere thought of ever violating his pledge. 
               When it was finished, Father Eustace said: 
               "Now, my son, you have taken such an oath as will subject you to the anathema maranatha if it is ever broken. You will now listen to the story I have to narrate." 
               The secret to which all this preparation led was the existence of Louis of France, and his residence under M. Lecour's roof. As the reader is already aware of his captivity at Bellair, we pass over such details as would be superfluous. When M. Mendon was in possession of these facts, the speaker went on: 
               "I succeeded in opening a communication with Mademoiselle Durand, who, I was aware from the first, is a young person in whose movements I am entitled to take the deepest interest. When you first spoke of her, I did not betray this fact to you, because I could see no benefit to arise from so doing. I revealed to Adrienne the existence of a prisoner of state kept within those walls, to whom I must gain access. In the name of the Church I commanded her to play the part of the spy upon this old man, and I left her in the belief that she was pledged to obey my commands. 
               "To-day she was to have met me beside the fountain on the lawn, and reveal to me such discoveries as she may have been able to make. She dared to fail me; in place of coming to the rendezvous herself, I found a letter, placed in a conspicuous spot where I could not fail to see it. I will read it to you, that you may see how she excuses herself." 
               He drew forth a folded paper, and read from it the following words: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "FATHER EUSTACE:-If you really stand toward me in the relation you asserted when we last met, you cannot exact of me the sacrifice of my principles and the risking of my life to obey your commands. I dare not play a false part to the old man who has given me shelter, neither am I willing to do so. I shrink from the thought of treachery to him while I remain an inmate of his house. Pardon me, father, but I will not become a spy upon him, nor will I be tempted to betray the secrets of his house, if I should discover any. 
                           
                              "ADRIENNE DURAND."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "See with what conscious duplicity that last sentence was written. I can even detect it in the feeble strokes which form the letters, for the girl knew in her soul that they were intended only to lead me from the truth. I am certain now that my information is correct. Adrienne has learned the presence of Prince Louis in that old ruin, and she was afraid to meet me to-day lest I should wring it from her." 
               "What does she mean by the relation in which you stand to her?" asked M. Mendon. 
               For an instant the priest seemed to hesitate as to the course he should pursue. He then looked his companion straight in the eye, and said: 
               "Perfect frankness will be the best policy with you now. We are pledged to sustain each other, and I will not hesitate to trust you. I revealed to Adrienne a fact I have hitherto kept secret from her. I am Julien Durand, the husband of M. Lecour's daughter, and the father of her child. On the death of my wife, I took the vows, and the little girl was received into the nunnery of which I afterwards became the confessor. Thus I was able to watch over her as she grew to womanhood; and it was a great shock to me when you revealed to me, a few evenings ago, that she had taken advantage of my absence from France to elope and adjure the calling to which I dedicated her from her infancy." 
                
               M. Mendon listened in bewildered astonishment. He incredulously asked: 
               "Can Adrienne really be your daughter! I had believed-had hoped that she would prove to be the child of-of your brother." 
               "Ah! that old story is known to you, then. Louise Montreuil was united to my only brother on the same night that gave my hand to Estelle Lecour. We were four romantic and silly young people, who thought a clandestine marriage the shortest road to happiness. It paved the way to death for one-worse than death to another; the third lived through years of misery, and I concealed my wrecked hopes and blighted life beneath the monk's cowl. Behold the results of an hour's folly." 
               "What was then the fate of the child that certainly came into existence?" 
               "M. Montreuil refused to recognize its existence. He induced his unhappy daughter to believe that she had been the victim of a villainous deception, and the infant would be a burden and a shame to her. He compelled her to relinquish it to the care of my wife, who undertook to nurse it with her own. But the little girl never flourished after she was separated from her mother; she died before the close of the second year, and my wife did not long survive her; both lie buried in the same grave. I returned from South America, where some complicated business affairs detained me until this time, only in season to bury her, and receive my own daughter under my protection. 
               "I was disgusted with life, and I placed the child with the same Lady Superior who had educated her mother, to be reared as one destined to take the vail. I took the vows; as I told you, and remained near her." 
               "And your brother, what of him through all these years? Why did he not claim his wife before she gave her hand to my brother, and prove the falsehood of the story which had imposed on her?" 
               An expression of intense suffering swept over the usually passionless face of the priest, and his voice sunk, as he said: 
               "Henri was in prison. He lay in the dungeons of the Bastile for years, and when he came forth, it was amid the raging mob which destroyed that dreadful pile, His nearest friends had no suspicion of what had become of him, with such caution were the measures for his incarceration taken. I believed that he had been murdered while on his journey to Paris, and his body concealed. All my efforts to discover his fate proved fruitless, and I at length relinquished every attempt. I had given him up as lost, when a miserable phantom came to me and proclaimed himself the twin brother, who had rotted in the dungeons of a remorseless government through all the best years of his manhood. It was pitiful to see how that strong and noble man was wrecked by one false step in life. 
               "Before Henri came to me, he had seen the woman who accompanied his wife to France; from her he had learned that his arrest had been the work of M. Montreuil, and that he had finally carried his point, and given Louise to her first lover. A report of Henri's death had been forwarded to M. Montreuil, and he explained to me that he had a companion in misery who died the second year after he joined him. There had been some hopes held out that this man would be released, and at his decease, my brother assumed his miserable identity, and caused the keeper to report him as dead. The turnkey endeavored to serve him thus far, for he had been touched by his-sufferings, but it resulted in nothing. The mandate for his enlargement never came, and he was only given back to the light of day by the tumultuous outbreak of the mob of Paris. 
                
               "By his own act, his wife had been led to believe herself released from the tie that bound them together, and Henri refused to assert his claims; time had barred them now, and the poor girl, who had been so deeply sinned against, could only be rendered miserable by his re-appearance. Since the knowledge of his existence could only lead to a dreadful scandal and great wretchedness to her, he would never inform her of his sufferings and his wrongs. 
               "He travelled in the East Indies, and was absent for years. While there, he formed an intimacy with a French physician who had resided in that country several years. Henri confided to him the sad story of his life, and finally studied medicine with him. Dr. Latour was suddenly summoned to France, and when he left the settlement, my brother assumed the duties of his practice, and remained there. 
               "The revolution, with all its horrors, was enacted, and the carnival of murder was held in every city in the realm. But death found work for himself in other lands beside this; in the quiet lowlands of Louisiana, he launched his quivers as in the thronged thoroughfare, and the tyrannical father, with the man he had chosen for his son, were struck down within a single week. Louise was free once more. 
               "I heard of her as a brilliant and fascinating widow, and I lost no time in writing to Henri to return, vindicate himself, and claim her as his own. My letter was a year on its way, and a second one had nearly elapsed before he stood before me once more. He was brown and wrinkled, and his hair was blanched to silver, but he believed the true heart of his first love would receive him as fondly as ever. 
               "Buoyed up by such hopes, he embarked for New Orleans. I know that he safely reached that place, and set out for Bellair. From that point all clue to his fate was lost: one reason why I was willing to accept this mission was, that I might seek some information relative to the disappearance of Henri Durand. The mystery of his fate must be solved before I leave Louisiana." 
               "In what year did he come hither?" 
               "It is now six years since he landed at New Orleans." 
               "My sister died about that time, and when M. Durand found that she had again placed a bar to their reunion, by accepting M. Lecour, I think it possible that he destroyed himself. That seems to me the most probable end to so wretched a destiny." 
               " No, no," said the priest, with sombre emphasis. "My brother would never have committed suicide, for he believed in a future-in God and his immutable justice. I shall discover the truth yet, and woe-woe to him whose hand was lifted against his life. I believe that he was foully murdered, and I am here to avenge the deed. I shall discover its perpetrator, and then--Let us not talk of him-it unmans me." 
               After a pause, M. Mendon asked: 
               "How is it that M. Lecour does not recognize you?" 
               "We have not met since I was quite a youth, and few would see in the cold, ascetic priest the gay, impulsive boy, who thought it a dashing exploit to run off with the daughter of his old enemy. The feud between the aristocrats and the plebeians had long existed in France, before the final explosion came: and bitter blood had been kept up for more than one generation between the bourgeois family of Lecour and the noble one of Durand. We were very poor, but very proud, and a sarcasm uttered by my father against M. Lecour, who was his cotemporary, was never forgiven. When his daughter wedded the son of a man who had thus insulted him, it aroused all the ire of his nature, and he hurled at her a curse which was never revoked. It broke the poor girl's heart, for she inherited none of his hardness of nature." 
                
               "By what chance did this man wander here, and make my poor sister his victim? Can you reveal the secret of his power over Louise? for some power he must have possessed, to compel her to marry him as she did." 
               "I have also possessed myself of that. Dr. Latour, the bosom friend of Henri, was the half brother of Lecour, though my brother was never aware of the relationship. He knew the deadly hostility cherished toward all of our name by the bloody sansculotte, who was one of the most active instigators of the atrocities perpetrated in Paris. No sooner had he gained the confidence of my poor brother, than he wrote the whole story to Lecour. When it reached him he was preparing to emigrate to Louisiana with the imbecile prince in his keeping. It suggested to him a double villainy: he would come to this colony armed with the knowledge of Louise Montreuil's early history, and use it for his own base purposes. Although M. Lecour was aware of the validity of the first marriage, he did not impart any such knowledge to her-no-he induced her to believe that he could hurl her from her proud position, and render her a gibe for the scorner, by proclaiming the fact that she had lived with Henri Durand as his wife, without being legally united to him. Behold the secret of that most wretched union, which deprived the unhappy Louise of nearly every friend she claimed, and threw her absolutely into the power of this atrocious old man. He gained by this marriage a home for himself, wealth, and a place of concealment for the prisoner under his charge." 
               "Poor Louise-unhappy sister, I see it all now. And we cast her off, when she most needed our support and protection." 
               "All that is now past recall," replied Father Eustace. "What remains for us to do, is to thwart the last piece of villainy conceived by this old reprobate, and bring retribution tion upon him for his multiplied crimes. I have certain information that Lecour is secretly making arrangements to return to France, accompanied by the helpless imbecile who was born her ruler. The design is to place him upon the throne, with Bonaparte as military dictator. It is only one step forward in the ambitious game the first consul is playing, but Lecour is not sufficiently far-sighted to see that he and his proteg will be crushed as soon as they are no longer needed to sustain Napoleon's greatness. 
               "M. Lecour is bound by every tie of honor to the interests of the Comte d'Artois, from whose party he has received large sums of money; yet now, at the first temptation, he is ready to betray him, and destroy all present chance for him to regain the throne of his ancestors. I have been sent hither to circumvent his plans, for they were betrayed from the beginning. He has the hardihood to deny to me the existence of the prince, and gives all the details of his death soon after he was removed to Bellair; but I am too well informed to be deceived. Louis lives concealed in some apartment in that rambling old ruin, and when I have discovered his exact whereabouts, I can carry out the plan I have arranged for getting him into my own hands." 
               "I am familiar with every nook and cranny in the house, and if the prince is still there, I am certain that I can soon ascertain in what portion of the building he is confined. But what is then your purpose?" 
               "To enter the house in disguise, remove Louis and put him in charge of a Canadian voyageur who is concealed in the neighborhood awaiting my orders. Franois has a keel boat under his command, which is stationed a few miles above the landing, and every minuti is arranged for a successful abduction. Once embarked on the Mississippi, all clue to his whereabouts will be lost to those who would use him only as a stepping stone to power. Safe in Canada, and his identity will be forever lost. Aid me to accomplish this end, and I promise you the hand of my daughter, with the certainty of succeeding to the Montreuil estate." 
               "How is that certainty to be gained?" 
               "That is my own affair. You may trust me, for my interests are as deeply involved in the issue as your own." 
               "I will trust you, for that is my only hope of winning the charming Adrienne." 
               Father Eustace cast a searching glance at him, as he enquired with a curling lip: 
               "Do you really love her, Monsieur? or is the fortune with which I pledge myself she shall be endowed, the chief attraction?" 
               "I can truly say that I love this young girl, though the prospect of fortune with her hand undoubtedly carries with it much weight to a man in my position. I was strongly attached to my unfortunate sister, and there is a marvellous resemblance between her and Mademoiselle Adrienne." 
               At this assertion, the countenance of the priest changed slightly, and he impatiently said: 
               "Lay that thought at rest; the likeness is accidental. In some respects, Adrienne is much like my own family. And now, M. Mendon, when is it your purpose to commence your reconnoisance at Bellair? The more prompt the action, the more certain will be the reward." 
               "I will go there to-morrow night, and be assured I shall bring you back a satisfactory report. I know a private entrance which is now overgrown with vines and weeds. The secret of opening it from without, has been familiar to me from my boyhood, and I am certain of gaining access to the chateau by its means. If Louis is there, you shall know his precise position in twenty-four hours." 
               "Good-and in a week, Adrienne shall be your wife." 
               "It is of course your purpose to remove her with the Prince? It will scarcely be safe to leave her exposed to the suspicious rage of M. Lecour, after the abduction is made." 
               "It will be impossible to do so. It is important that we act secretly and promptly; but few can be engaged in the enterprise, and the presence of a young girl would embarrass our movements too much. Adrienne must be left a few hours to bear the brunt of her grandfather's anger. She is of his blood, and he will scarcely do her any serious injury before we go openly to him and claim her as my daughter, and your promised bride." 
               M. Mendon still murmured at this arrangement, but Father Eustace so earnestly argued in favor of the necessity of permitting Mademoiselle Durand to remain at Bellair a few hours, while the safe removal of the Prince was secured, that he could not insist on his own views being adopted. 
               Their future proceedings were carefully considered, and every detail canvassed before the two separated for the night. One went his way elated with the thought that, by one bold stroke, he had secured love and fortune; the other sat till nearly dawn, gloomy and saturnine, meditating on the retributive justice of which this blow was only the first move in the game he was resolute to play to the end. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               THE SOMNAMBULIST. DEADLY PERIL. 
               FOR several hours Adrienne slept heavily, and dreamlessly; but so soon as the physical portion of her being was sufficiently rested, the spiritual essence began to play its usual pranks. She arose with eyes wide open, looking straight before her, yet evidently seeing nothing. 
                
               She dressed herself carefully, and then in place of her shawl, she drew the white coverlet from the bed and threw it over her person. It was a bright moonlit night, and with noiseless steps, the somnambulist glided across the upper gallery, and descended the staircase. The white figure flitted from door to door in the old house, and tried the fastenings. Not one yielded before her, and with a slight stamp, and a muttered expression of disappointment, she passed on and reached the room which Eady had spoken of as inaccessible to every one save M. Lecour. 
               The door yielded to her touch, and a flood of light streamed out of the mysterious apartment. In the centre of the floor stood a table on which a dozen wax candles were burning, and M. Lecour, with his back to the door stood in front of an iron safe constructed in the wall, the contents of which he was absorbed in examining, A small casket filled with diamonds of great lustre and purity, was in his hands, and he turned them from side to side, to watch with the greed of the miser, and the taste of the artist, the many changing hues they assumed. There was only a single chair in the room, but, the walls were covered with paintings from the pencil of M. Lecour, depicting the most stirring events of his wild and stormy career. 
               Opposite the entrance hung the picture of one of the most remarkable scenes related in history: the last supper of the Girondists on the night previous to their execution. The interior of a vast dungeon was represented, in which was set a table bearing a magnificent repast; the choicest wines gleamed in crystal goblets, and the rarest flowers bloomed at this banquet of death. Twenty-one living men were gathered around it, and one lay lifeless in the dim background-Valeg, who had committed suicide when the sentence of death was pronounced against his party. Five figures stood out in prominent relief upon the canvas. At the head of the table sat a massive form, whose eyes, dimmed by confinement in prison, whose livid cheeks and tangled masses of black hair could not destroy the natural majesty of the leader of the powerful party that once ruled France-Vergniaud bore the stamp of his great genius upon him. 
               A man of haughty, patrician features, and military bearing, sat near him. This was Sillery, the friend of Egalit, who had voted for the death of Louis XVI. Opposite to him sat Duchatel, a youthful man, who had been carried to the tribune almost in a dying state, to vote against the execution of his sovereign. Two men near his own age were beside him, Ducos and Fronfrede; and contrasted with them was Brissot, a man of middle age, small stature and wan features. These had evidently been the persons who most deeply interested the artist, for they were limned with all his peculiar power. 
               The execution of Louis XVI. hung over the mantel, and the murder of Marat by Charlotte Corday was placed opposite to it. There were heads of Danton, Robespierre, and other fanatics of those fatal days, and all had one peculiarity which was due to the fantasy of the painter. This was a faint line of red around the throat of each, shadowing forth the doom that had fallen on every one. 
               Over the portrait of Robespierre a lurid haze appeared to float, from which faces dimly seen seemed ready to emerge. These shadows represented youth, maturity and old age, all wearing an expression of anguish which it was painful to behold, and their pale lips seemed ready to unclose and utter anathemas against the callous ruler who sent them all to one common doom-the knife of the guillotine. 
               The associations connected with this room were terrible, yet M. Lecour spent many hours in it each night, gloating over the treasures he had there concealed. The exercise of his singular power to portray the most awful scenes of that grand tragedy, in which he had played a part, had become a monomania with the solitary old man. His pictures had not much accuracy of finish, but the drawing was full of spirit, and the figures so life-like, that it was evident the artist had reproduced actual scenes, which had made a vivid and indelible impression upon his own mind. 
               As Adrienne paused within the doorway, an enormous bloodhound, chained to the wall, made a bound toward her, with fierce eyes and gleaming teeth-but he suddenly crouched at her feet, and uttered a low, pitiful whine. Absorbed in his employment, M. Lecour did not heed the noise he made. He held up a large rose diamond, and muttered: 
               "Here is a prince's ransom shut up in these brilliant beauties. Ah, what on earth can be compared to the diamond in splendor and value? Here they are of all known shades-blue, black, rose, and yellow. This great sparkler was the centre of a cluster in the famous Queen's necklace. That was one of the slanders which paved the way to the scaffold for you, Marie Antoinette. A woman's vanity turned against herself! Ha! ha! was not there some justice in that? Yes, I triumph in the thought that a noble, a prince was the originator of that brilliant swindle; his accomplice a woman of royal blood, though unacknowledged by the race from which she sprang. Truly, old things have, passed away, when the blood of a consecrated king could be poured forth as ruthlessly as that of the vilest churl. 
               "The world is awakening to its true destiny, and the rights of man, as man, have begun to be recognized. Ah, that awful upheaving of the masses, was a warning that future ages will do well not to forget. These gems are to me a cabinet of history. Here is one that once gleamed upon the brow of Catharine of Russia; cold, hard, glittering, it is emblematic of its wearer. This hoop, set with brilliants, belonged to the majestic and unfortunate Madame Roland; she was truly a queen among women; one on whom the great Master of Life had placed his own signet." 
               Suddenly his brow contracted, his eyes flashed, and he snatched up a ring, in which a single carbuncle of remarkable size and brilliancy was set. His voice grew harsh and loud, as he exclaimed: 
               "How did this find its way among my historical gems. H. D. to L. M. Ha! an ominous present from him to her, for the stone is like crystallized blood. Ugh! see how it glints back the red light." 
               The hound again uttered a low, melancholy whine, prolonged so indefinitely that it attracted the attention of his master; he turned sharply around, and saw the figure wrapped in white, which had now passed half-way across the floor, and paused, with an expression of intense suffering and dread upon her features. 
               The casket fell from the paralyzed hands of M. Lecour, and its glittering contents were scattered at his feet. One hasty glance convinced him that the White Terror was upon him, and he cowered down in abject fear. 
               Adrienne raised her arm, pointed slowly to the different pictures, and her rigid lips unclosed to utter: 
               "There, there, the phantoms step out from their frames; each weird form carries his head in his hand, and they flit around, and point to you, old man, as their airy lips mutter: 
               "'To you-to you I owe my doom.' 
               "I see them, I hear them, though they are impalpable to mortal touch, inaudible to your sealed senses." 
               The sound of her voice brought back self-possession to M. Lecour. His first impulse was to bound up in a fury and punish her for her intrusion, but he instantly comprehended the condition in which she was, and a moment's reflection convinced him that it would be far better to remove her from the apartment before consciousness returned, than to be guilty of any violence toward her there. He would take good care that she did not again intrude into this sanctuary, in which he hoarded his most precious possessions. 
               As M. Lecour drew near her, he paused an instant, and looked upon the colorless face and striking attitude of the somnambulist. A cold shiver passed through his frame as he muttered: 
               "Good heavens! it is her very self! Is it not a curse to me that one of my race should have assumed her form and bearing? I should get rid of this creature; she is becoming an incubus upon me. I cannot endure her presence much longer. Ah! if she should awake here, her doom would be sealed. Living, she should never pass yonder threshold." 
               The thoughts that flitted through his mind seemed to be read by the sleeping girl, for she turned toward him, and impressively said: 
               "'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,' is the awful utterance of Jehovah. You dare not touch me here, for the very shadows of your victims flit around me, and form a cordon between us which it is impossible for you to pass. Let me go-let me go, for the very atmosphere of this dreadful room is stifling to me." 
               Adrienne passed him with that same gliding motion which gave her so much the appearance of a spirit, and rapidly ascended the staircase to her own room. M. Lecour followed, and watched her until the door closed upon her, and then returned to gather up his jewels and put them in the iron safe he had caused to be enclosed in the wall of the room. 
               The dog still lay crouched upon the floor, moaning as if in fear or pain. His master brutally said: 
                
               "Up, up, old Cerberus, and do not behave as if you are in your dotage. What is there in the appearance of a sleeping girl to make you act like a whipped cur?" 
               He pulled roughly at the chain as a hint to its wearer that he had better return to his usual lair; the motion seemed to arouse the dog to sudden fury against his master, and he sprang upon him with a savage growl. The glaring eyes and foaming mouth warned M. Lecour of his danger, and he sprang back with as much agility as he could command, but his muscles were not what they once had been, and he did not get quite beyond the reach of the ferocious animal. His fangs fastened upon the long dressing robe usually worn by his master, and in doing so grazed the skin of his right hand. 
               M. Lecour found himself at the mercy of an infuriated beast, which, until that moment, he had believed completely under his command. But one hope of escape was left him; he thrust his hand within his breast, drew forth a glittering blade, and with sure aim plunged it into the heart of the enraged animal. 
               The hound fell mortally wounded at his feet, and his blood gushed over his master as he tore his gown from the frothing mouth of the creature he had lately believed devoted to him. He scarcely noticed the trifling scratch his hand had received as he sat down to collect his thoughts, and a bitter feeling of desolation came upon him as he watched the last struggles of the dying animal. Unconsciously he spoke aloud: 
               "I thought this wretch was my slave; that the hand that fed him would surely be loved by him, and there he lies, slain in my own defence. It is surely written that I shall destroy all that comes within my sphere-all, all, for have I not done so throughout my life? Why hope or expect to escape my doom now? I have good cause to be a fatalist. Yes, I was evidently foredoomed to become an agent of evil, and I must work out my destiny. 
               "The girl brought on this catastrophe; why should her presence in this forbidden spot have caused my faithful guardian to turn against me? Is it that she is inimical to me? Ha! let her look to herself, for, grandchild as she asserts herself to be, I will put her from my path if I have reason to believe her either a spy or a stumbling-block upon it." 
               He spurned the stiffening body of the dog aside, and proceeded to search for the scattered diamonds. With all the greed and avarice shining in his eyes he peered around, and looked in every crevice till the number was completed, but the ring which he had held in his hand at the moment he discovered the intrusion of Adrienne was nowhere to be found. He remembered throwing toward her the hand that grasped it, and it had probably fallen among the meshes of her long hair, which was hanging loosely around her shoulders. 
               If it had done so, how could Adrienne account for its possession, without recalling the whole scene in which she had borne so critical a part? He had often read that somnambulists retain no recollection of the places they visit in their nocturnal rambles; and this alone saved poor Adrienne from a severe investigation in the events of the night. Convinced that the ring had been unconsciously taken away by her, M. Lecour secured his casket, locked his safe, and replaced the picture which concealed its position. After extinguishing all the candles except one, he unlocked the chain of the murdered hound, and kicked his body outside the room; then securely fastening the door, he rapidly ascended the staircase, and took refuge in his own apartment. 
               On the following morning Adrienne awoke with a vague sense of oppression, and the consciousness that some unpleasant impression had been made upon her senses during the hours of sleep, but she retained no clear recollection of its cause. The flitting memories that at moments came to her, seemed like fragments of a wild dream, and she commenced her morning toilet with the resolution to banish such weird fantasies from her mind. 
               She lifted her robe from the chair on which it had been placed on the previous night, and to her intense astonishment a ring rolled from its folds upon the floor. A stone of a deep vivid red color flashed back the morning sunshine, and she examined it in a state of fearful perplexity. It bore four initials which were not familiar to her, though she recognized two of them as probably belonging to the former lady of Bellair. 
               How came it in her room? was the question that suggested itself, but to which she could give no answer. While Adrienne sat with it in her hand, vainly pondering upon this new mystery, Eady came in with eyes distended to nearly twice their usual size, and looking husky from extreme fright. 
               Startled by her appearance, her young lady quickly inquired: 
               "What has happened, Eady? Is mon pre ill?" 
               "I darsn't go in to ax," was the dreary response. "I clar' to Moses, ef de sight I seen down stairs hav'n't tuck away all my bref." 
               "What was it?" asked Adrienne, excited nearly as much as the old woman. 
               "Dat cussed dog what kep' watch in de room o' de pictures, is a lyin' down afore de door in a pool o' his own blood, wi' a great gash in his breas'." 
               Adrienne started up and exclaimed: 
               "Who could have done it? perhaps something has happened pened to my grandfather. He would never have killed his faithful guardian himself. Let us go at once, Eady, and see if he is safe." 
               In her excitement and alarm, she forgot the ring, and it fell upon the floor. Eady snatched it up, looking more scared and bewildered than before. She falteringly asked: 
               "Wh-a-r did you get this from, young mistis?" 
               "That is what I should be glad to know myself. I found it in the folds of my dress this morning, though how it came there I am sure I cannot tell." 
               "Whar was you las' nite?" asked the woman in a frightened tone. "Oh, lor! oh, lor! dis ring was in dat room yonder, as sure as you'm a livin' creeter, an' it's some trick o' his'n to git you in his power, dat put it 'bout you. Oh, chile, I is feared for you, I is feared for you." 
               Adrienne put her hand to her brow, and slowly said: 
               "I have a faint recollection of seeing the interior of the picture room, but it must have been in a dream, for I awoke in bed as usual this morning." 
               "But how came you by de ring? Dere's de onsolefiable misery. Young mistis, you is a sleepwalker, an' you mus' ha' bin in dat room; but I warns you, ef you vally yer life, not to let on dat sich a thing have happened to you. I tell you it is as much as your life is worf to let him know dat you' member bin in dat place. I wonder ef he killed de dog to keep him off you. I don b'lieve he did, coz he'd sooner ha' set him on you, ef he foun' you 'trudin' whar you warn't wanted. I knows dis here ring, an' it was in de persession o' my marster, I can swar." 
               "It's a lady's ring," said Adrienne, "and I suppose it must once have belonged to his wife." 
               "Yes," replied Eady, drearily enough. "It b'longed to her afore she ever sot her unfort'nit eyes on him. I don' know de hist'ry o' dat shinin' thing, but I has seen de mistis cry over it a many times, when she didn't know anybody disarnin' of her. When she were a lyin' in her coffin he came an' said it were a shame dat sich a valerable stone should be put in de grave, an' he tuck it off her finger hisself. From dat day till now, I hasn't ever seen it ag'in." 
               While she talked on, Eady keenly regarded Adrienne, and after she finished speaking, she muttered: 
               "Oh, ef I darst to speak out, but I darsn't. I'd better not just yit. Poor thing, what can she do to help us all?" 
               Adrienne was infected by the woman's terror, and she asked: 
               "If this ring really belongs to M. Lecour, how can I return it to him without arousing enquiries which I could not safely answer? I have no idea how it came into my possession, and if he finds me with it, he may suspect me of prying into his secret places." 
               "Dat's God's trufe, young mistis; an' if he 'spect you of any sich perceedin', it aint much longer you'd stay along of us. I don't say whar you'd go, but it 'ud be to some place whar we'd never hear of you any mo'. Ef you'll listen to my 'vice, jes' give me dat ring, and I'll take it down an' drap it 'bout be dog. Mebbe I can make him b'lieve it were found thar." 
               As Adrienne was thoroughly frightened, and did not know very well what course to pursue, she at once adopted this suggestion; she surrendered the ring to Eady, who impressively added: 
               "Now don' you let on dat you ever seen it afore; an' be sure you don' let him know a breath o' your dream, for it wouldn't be safe for you, I tell you." 
               "You must think M. Lecour a terrible being, Eady," said Adrienne, with a shudder she could not repress. "I wonder you are not afraid to live in the house with a man you mistrust so much." 
                
               "I wouldn't ef I could git away, young mistis. I is feared o' him, an' wi' good cause too, as you'd know ef I could tell you all. Dis bloody stone ain't harder nor colder 'n his heart. Heart! 'ndeed he's got no sich inconvenient thing 'bout his pusson. Since you's come here, you mus' take care o' your own safety, an' ef you'll listen to me, you'll never let him know dat you's diskivered any o' his doin's." 
               "I do not think he would harm me, Eady, for I am his daughter's child." 
               "An' much he'd care about dat, when his evil natur' was up," was the contemptuous response. "I know what he's up to when the cruel blood is roused, for I's seen his doin's afore to-day. I tell you your gran'ther is a orfle fearsome man to deal wi! You's warned, young mistis, an' now I mus go an' see what's 'come o' him." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               AN INVITATION TO BREAKFAST. 
               EADY disappeared, and Adrienne sat still and pale, reflecting upon her warning. She vainly endeavored to recall the fitful snatches of her vision of the previous night, and arrange them in a reliable shape. They evaded her like the fragments of an imperfect dream, and the means by which the ring came into her possession remained as much a mystery as ever. 
               In pursuance of her plan, Eady overcame her repugnance to the idea of approaching the dog, for he had been too great a terror to her, while living, to be entirely divested of it now, although his body lay stark and stiff upon the floor of the lower hall. With a rapid glance around, to assure herself that her master was not watching her, she dropped the ring upon a small knob which fastened his collar, and again sped up the staircase. 
               The knock upon her master's door was immediately responded to, and when she entered, she found M. Lecour sitting in his large chair, still wearing the torn and soiled gown in which his conflict with the bloodhound had taken place. He had evidently not slept during the past night, and the glassy stare in his eyes betrayed that he had passed its later hours in using the fatal stimulant to which he was habituated. He roughly said: 
               "What has kept you so late this morning, you horrid black goblin? See-my dog has gone mad, and half torn off my dressing-gown. I was forced to kill him, to save my own life. Curse the miserable, ungrateful brute." 
               "An' dat fierce creetur turned on you sure 'nuff? It's a mercy dat you's here to tell on it at all." 
               "A mercy! umph! I wonder if you really think so. Tell Pierre to go to the overseer and get me the fiercest blood-hound he has. I'll soon tame him to my hand, I'll warrant. I'll chain him in the lower room, and let him starve till he'll be glad to see any one bearing him food." 
               "I thought somethin' dreffle had happened, when I saw de creetur a lyin' out yonder, stiff an' dead. What shall be done wi' his body, sir?" 
               "Dig a hole, and put it in it, of course, you stupid simpleton. Take off his collar first though, and send it over to the quarter for his successor, I believe I will go down myself, and see the wound I gave him." 
               M. Lecour drew the torn robe around his tall person, and preceded the negress to the lower gallery. With a trembling heart Eady followed, fearing what might burst from him when he discovered the ring lying in the conspicuous position in which she had placed it. They reached the body of the dog, and to her intense amazement, the jewel had disappeared. 
               Who could have taken it? Pierre she knew was at work in his garden, and she was quite sure that Adrienne had not left her own apartment during her brief stay in her master's room. Then by whose agency had the ring been spirited away? In a state of extreme alarm, she watched her master, fearing that he would announce his loss, and command her to seek the gem until it was restored to him. 
               With horrible gusto, M. Lecour examined the yawning wound he had inflicted upon the hound, and an expression of serene satisfaction crossed his features as he muttered: 
               "My hand is as sure now as when it dealt death to my enemy. It is well to know the vital point in every organization; a false blow last night, and I should have been mangled by that ferocious beast, but my skill-my cunning, saved me. Faugh! Call Pierre, and hasten to remove this carcass. Inform Mademoiselle Adrienne that I invite her to breakfast with me this morning." 
               He slowly ascended the staircase, and entered his own room. 
               In silent bewilderment Eady obeyed his commands. She summoned her husband, and informed him of the duties delegated to him, and then went to Adrienne's tower to make her aware of the unusual courtesy which had been extended to her. 
               "I shall be quite ready," was the response of her young lady. "But when will the morning meal of the Prince be served? Must I not be present at that?" 
               "Oh, no, young mistis. He allers eats his breakfast in bed. He is a poor mis'able creetur, though he is made so much on, an' made to b'lieve he's a king. He aint got the sense to know better hisself, or he'd soon find out dat it's a mighty poor kingdom he rules over." 
                
               "What have you done with the ring, Eady?" asked Adrienne, reverting to the subject which most deeply interested her. 
               "I don' know what's came on it, and when I tells you what's happened, you won't believe me, I know." 
               "What, then, has happened?" 
               With many contortions of the body, Eady related the singular disappearance of the ring with tolerable accuracy, but at its close she could not forbear to throw in a touch of her own. 
               "I b'lieves de ebissary tuck it off, caze I smelled brimstone in de a'r, an' I heard a noise what sounded like his cloven feet makin' dere way 'cross de floor. But Lor'! he didn't mind dem demonstrations, for I reckon he's usen to 'em." 
               Adrienne was half inclined to believe that the old woman's story was an entire fabrication, but what her object was in deceiving her, she could not fathom. An imperious summons from M. Lecour abruptly terminated the conversation, and the negress had only time to raise her finger warningly, and said: 
               "You aint axed to eat breakfis' wi' him for nothin', an' you'd better be on your guard. Don't let him find out anythin' 'bout dat are ring from you." 
               Adrienne felt as if she was almost entering into a league with this poor old black against her grandfather, and she mentally resolved that she would not be influenced by her to pursue a course of deception which, if discovered by M. Lecour, would justly arouse his anger. Mysteriously as the jewel had come into her possession, if he inquired about it, why should she not have courage to speak the truth, and in so doing, perhaps gain the clue to what had actually happened during the past night. 
               Yet if the ring was really lost, would not his anger light as a consuming fire upon the poor defenceless slave who seemed to live in perpetual terror of him? 
               As Adrienne passed Eady, she whispered eagerly: 
               "He'll take my life ef he finds out dat I've lost it; spar' me, young mistis, as you hope for mercy yourself." 
               Adrienne glanced at the husky looking face which so visibly betrayed how deeply the old woman was suffering, and she could not refuse a sign of re-assurance. She had every reason to believe that Eady was faithful to her, and she dared not risk doing her an irreparable injury, even if she failed in the duty she owed her grandfather. 
               With assumed calmness the young girl offered M. Lecour the salutations of the morning, and took her place at the table. He had laid aside his torn dressing-gown, and assumed one of brocade, worn almost threadbare, which hung loosely upon his person, as if not originally made for him. His face looked colder and sterner than ever, and Adrienne felt his searching gaze fixed unflinchingly upon her features. 
               He commanded Eady to leave the room, and then sipped the strong coffee prepared for him in ominous silence. The poor girl had little appetite, and she only made a pretense of eating a small portion of biscuit. To the few remarks she ventured to make, her companion made no reply. At length he placed his cup on the table, and drily said: 
               "Your nocturnal rambles do not seem to have improved your appetite. Are you aware, Mademoiselle, that you were in my room last night?" 
               Adrienne started, and raised her eyes to his. She saw in those steely blue orbs the same glare which had lighted them up when he dealt the death blow to his hound on the previous night. It warned her that she was in danger, but how or why, she did not comprehend. She faintly said: 
               "The intrusion was an unconscious one on my part,  for I retain no recollection whatever of coming into this apartment." 
               "Nor into any other?" he searchingly asked. 
               Again that confused vision flitted across her mind, but she could draw from it nothing tangible, and she slowly shook her head: 
               "I cannot recall the incidents of the night." 
               "Are you quite sure? Did you find nothing about your person afterwards which might have suggested to you that you had left your own room?" 
               He bent eagerly forward, and again that expression of ferocious earnestness flashed from his eyes. It vividly impressed upon her mind the necessity of concealment, and she evasively replied: 
               "When I awoke this morning I was in bed as usual, and there was nothing in the room to induce me to think that I had left it during the night. I trust you do not suspect me of meddling with anything belonging to you, Monsieur? I have long known that I am a somnambulist, but I do not think I would appropriate the property of another while in that condition." 
               "Oh, I do not mean that you have actually committed a theft, child. The article I missed was valuable, but so small that it might have fallen among the folds of white drapery you had wrapped around you, or got tangled in the meshes of your hair, without your being aware of it." 
               "May I inquire what you have lost?" asked Adrienne, now resolute to preserve her own secret, for she intuitively felt that the avowal of having found the ring, without being able to produce it, would not only be dangerous to Eady, but also to herself. 
               "Since you have not found it, you need not be any further enlightened," he curtly replied. "You are quite sure that you retain no recollection of the wanderings of last night?" 
                
               "I seem to have had a frightful vision of headless men flitting around me, as they stepped out from the pictures which represent them, and assumed the appearance of life; beyond that I can recall nothing distinctly." 
               M. Lecour laughed discordantly. 
               "Ha! ha! your imagination is becoming infected with the spirit of this house. You learned yesterday who lives up stairs, and your thoughts were naturally busy with the ghastly times which reduced a Bourbon prince to the condition in which you saw Louis. Thus, you see, your dream is easily accounted for. Let me warn you of one thing, Mademoiselle; this time you have escaped punishment; but I will not brook a second intrusion, even if it is unconscious on your part. It was not here you came to me, but in my private sanctum, into which I have said no intruder should enter and live! Had you been conscious, I should have kept my word." 
               Adrienne regarded him in silent consternation, and he rapidly went on: 
               "To save you from the fury of the dog kept constantly chained there, I was compelled to slay him. See!" and he pointed to the torn and blood-stained gown which was thrown over his couch. 
               "And I remained asleep through all that struggle?" asked Adrienne, incredulously. 
               "Assuredly, or I should scarcely have invited you here to listen to these facts. My object in so doing is to guard against a second visit from you, as that might not terminate so well for you. I had but to remain passive last night, and the ferocious bloodhound would have torn you piecemeal. If you enter that forbidden door again, even in the trance of somnabulism, it will be fatal to you. A second time, I will not lift my finger to save you." 
               The young girl listened with eyes dilating with horror, and she would fain have persuaded herself that she could not have heard him aright; but a single glance at the fixed icy face that confronted her, showed her that M. Lecour was terribly in earnest. 
               Her courage deserted her, and she dropped her head upon her hands, and burst into a passion of tears He continued to sip his coffee with perfect composure; he was evidently waiting for her response. Adrienne at length found voice to say: 
               "I have come to you, Monsieur, a helpless, defenceless girl, with the strongest claims upon you as the child of your only daughter. Is this the treatment I had a right to expect from my own grandfather?" 
               He coolly replied: 
               "Had your mother been a dutiful and obedient daughter, perhaps your claim might have possessed some weight; but she was an ingrate. She defied my wishes and gave, herself to one of a race I detested. She met the fate I denounced against her, for she died a beggar and her orphan child was left to my mercy. It did not fail you. I caused you to be placed where you were properly taken care of, where you might have remained in safety but you preferred to thrust yourself into my den. You have made yourself the mistress of a secret of vital importance to me, and now you must abide the consequences. I am a despot in my own house-a cruel one, if you will but I choose to be obeyed; neither will I be interfered with. I do not love you, but I tolerate your presence, because you can be of use to me; but if you wander where you should not, although your senses are bound in this mysterious sleep, I shall do nothing to save you from the consequences of your own rashness. Once to have risked my own life to save one that is valueless to me is quite enough, in all conscience." 
                
               "In that condition, I am quite unconscious of all my actions; how, then, shall I preserve myself from this danger?" faintly asked Adrienne. 
               "I know of no other way than to let Eady lock your door on the outside every night, and take away the key. Then you would be unable to get out, even if you should attempt it." 
               "Since it is your will, let it be so," was the feeble response of the poor girl, who only now began to comprehend the wretched slavery into which she had thrown herself. 
               M. Lecour arose, pointed to the bookcase, and said: 
               "Get a book and read to me. I do not want a sermon again, but something suited to my taste. Take Volney's Ruins of Empire." 
               She hastened to obey him, and while he retouched again and again his ghastly painting of Marie Antoinette, the wounded heart was compelled to crush back its rising emotions, the trembling voice to steady itself, that she might perform her task in such a manner as not to arouse his anger. She read on until she was so hoarse she could scarcely articulate, and when the failing voice was nearly inaudible, M. Lecour sardonically said: 
               "You are soon worn out in my service, Mademoiselle. I thought you were made of tougher materials. You may retire now, and prepare yourself for your tour of duty with the Prince. You see yours henceforth is to be a busy life." 
               Glad of the permission to leave his presence, which began to be a terror and an oppression to her, Adrienne hurried to her own room, and in solitude tried to review her position, and fall on some plan of action which would ultimately enable her to go forth from this dreary and oppressive mansion free to act as she pleased. 
                
               Already did she find the prediction of M. Mendon verified, and life under the same roof with M. Lecour an intolerable burden; yet pride forbade that she should so soon shrink from the burdens she had voluntarily assumed. She had no resource but in the offers of protection from Madame Crozat and her stepson, and the condition on which that was to be obtained was too clearly intimated to admit of a doubt. 
               The priest might be able to protect her, and if he were really her father, as he asserted himself to be, it was clearly his duty to do so; but her heart refused utterly to sanction the relationship, and she believed that the first use he would make of parental authority would be to return her to her convent, to be more strictly guarded than ever. 
               Then she thought of her lover, and his speedy arrival in Louisiana. Du Vernay could rescue her-could bestow on her a happy and secure future; but, alas! that stern old man, with his blood-stained hand and icy heart, stood between them; and she comprehended that M. Lecour would immolate her himself sooner than see her go forth in freedom and safety to enjoy the wealth wrung from his own grasping hands. 
               Had she not herself written the fiat that separated them forever? She looked around for her letter, and saw that it was already gone. Eady had been instructed by her to send it to the office, and she had obeyed. 
               Poor Adrienne sat down with a feeling of utter desolation weighing upon her heart, but Eady came in almost immediately to assist in the elaborate toilette she must make for the dinner of the Prince. 
               The old woman was unusually silent, and at length Adrienne asked: 
               "How long has this young man resided here, Eady?" 
               "Oh, longer'n I knows on. I foun' him here when I come, and I reckin' he come from forrin parts wi' de marster." 
               "And have you never mentioned his presence here to any one?" 
               "Hi! I reckin I hasn't. Ef we was to, my ole man an' me I mean, we wouldn't stay long on dis part o' de yeth. We's had our orders a long time ago, an' we know's better'n to break 'em in de least 'tickler. I'm thankful, young mistis, dat you didn't tell 'bout de ring, but from dis time I aint gwine to talk no mo'. Things is happenin' in dis house dat I don' pertend to comprehend, an' I begin to b'lieve I had better hold my old tongue, an' keep out o' trouble." 
               Thereupon Eady closed her lips with an expression of conceited firmness which, under other circumstances, might have amused Adrienne, but just now her heart was too heavy to find cause for mirth in anything. 
               When her toilet was completed, she silently proceeded to the apartment of Louis, who sat in the same empty state in which she had beheld him on the previous day. His heavy face lighted up as she appeared, and he said, with some appearance of animation: 
               "Ah, Comtesse, you are welcome to my eyes, as is the sight of food when I am hungry. I am ill to-day. You shall amuse me by playing games with me, after dinner is over. It is my pleasure that you shall eat with me every day-that is, as long as it pleases me for you to do so." 
               "Your royal pleasure has only to be signified, my Prince, and you will find me an obedient subject," was the listless response, for Adrienne began to feel as if she would henceforth be passive in the hands of Fate. The desperate effort she had made to avert the evils of her lot had ended in this wretched subjection to a monomaniac and a half-witted boy. Why then should she struggle further? Let Destiny take its course, and her sad story speedily be ended. 
                
               When dinner was served, the same unmeaning ceremonial as on the preceding day was enacted, and so soon as the meal was over, M. Lecour retired. After removing the viands, Eady placed several boxes upon the table, at the sight of which the poor imbecile showed great delight. 
               On opening them, Adrienne found that they contained toy soldiers arranged in platoons and squares, and it was Louis's never ending amusement to remove them from the wooden pivots on which they stood, and place them in new positions. His half paralyzed hands often refused to perform this service, and it was the business of the companion provided for him to supply such deficiencies. 
               Adrienne was glad to be released from the task of reading this afternoon, but oppressed with sorrow as her mind was, it was with much effort she could listen to the silly prattle of the poor youth, or comply with his constant demands for attention. Louis left her not an instant of leisure, and it was an inexpressible relief to her when he at length sunk into sleep. 
               Afraid to remain and arouse the anger of M. Lecour; dreading even more than that the appearance of the phantom shape which had stood before her on the previous evening, Adrienne hastily gathered up the toys, and rang the bell to warn Pierre that their charge was ready for bed. 
               During the afternoon Pierre performed the task delegated to him of replacing the slaughtered bloodhound by another of his savage tribe. He was brought to his new home in a box securely fastened, in which a few air holes had been pierced to prevent the turbulent inmate from perishing from suffocation. Stifled barks and whines issued from the box, though the want of a sufficient supply of air had materially lessened his rampant desire to attack indiscriminately everything that approached him. 
               Pierre found the door of the tabooed apartment partly unclosed, but he did not presume to enter the place so terrific to his imagination; for the negro firmly believed that within those walls his master held interviews with the Evil One himself. 
               M. Lecour was within, and he burst forth with a number of expletives it is needless to repeat, when he witnessed the old man's hesitation; although he knew Pierre had been often warned of the fatal consequences likely to ensue to himself, if he ventured into those forbidden precincts. 
               "Bring the box in, stupid! Do you think I am going to haul the brute in myself, while you look idly on? Come into my den-look at these pictures; behold the mark of death upon them all, and thank your stars that your own head is safe upon your shoulders. Place the box upon the hearth-there. Now unlock it, and get out of the way before the insane brute within can make good his escape. I suppose the overseer had the sense to chain him fast to his prison?" 
               "Oh yes, monsieur; him chained fas' 'nuff," said Pierre, with alacrity, glad to be able to reply to the question in a satisfactory manner. "At fust he ramped about dreffle, but he's got quieter for want o' bref, I reckin." 
               "Get along with you, and mind how you speak of what you've seen in this place," growled M. Lecour. 
               The caution was quite superfluous, for the poor black was afraid to lift his eyes to the walls, and after unlocking the box, he shuffled out of the room as quickly as possible. 
               The door of his prison was scarcely unfastened, before a well-grown hound, with inflamed eyes and lolling tongue, thrust forth his head, and respired with long-drawn breathings until he had recovered his bodily powers. He then looked around the strange place to which he had been brought, glared on the motionless figure which stood with his eyes fixed sternly upon him, and gathered himself up for a leap toward his new master. 
                
               With all his muscular strength he sprang forward, dragging the box with him, and his outstretched paws almost grazed the breast at which he aimed. Another leap and he might be upon him, but M. Lecour did not recoil. He kept his stern gaze fixed on that of the dog, and there was something in the unflinching human eye that seemed to daunt his brute nature. He crouched upon the floor, uttered a long dismal howl, and did not seem disposed to renew the attack. 
               M. Lecour saw that he was snuffing around the blood of his predecessor, and he sardonically said: 
               "Ha! you have sense enough to be warned, have you? Smell at that pool, and learn discretion. There is water within your reach, left by your dead brother; but food you shall not see till you are subdued to my will." 
               Warily passing around the wall of the room, so as to keep beyond the limits of his chain, with his eyes still fastened immovably upon those of the savage animal, M. Lecour finally gained the door, stepped out, and locked it upon his captive. 
               When Adrienne came down stairs, she shuddered to hear the furious bounds and yelps of the imprisoned dog. With trembling haste, she ran across the lower hall, through the sitting-room, and up the private staircase to her own apartment. 
               Baleful eyes were watching her as she sprang through the door of the lower room, and cruel, resolute lips muttered: 
               "Ho! my dainty one, you need not fly from the sound of his voice, for you may yet make a nearer acquaintance with him than will be quite agreeable to you," and M. Lecour entered his chamber with the defiant expression upon his features which revealed all the reckless hardness of his nature. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               ADRIENNE'S FATE SETTLED BY LECOUR. 
               THREE days passed away in comparative quiet. After mature reflection, Adrienne wrote to Father Eustace in place of meeting him, for, situated as she was with M. Lecour, she could not bring her mind to play the part required of her by the priest. She believed that he had asserted the tie between them merely to gain a more complete ascendancy over her, and she feared his influence over her future fate too much to place herself willingly at his disposal. 
               M. Lecour received letters from France which occupied his attention, and gave him employment in replying to them. His wild night orgies had not filled the house with noise, as on the first night of her arrival, nor had the White Terror again visited her apartment. 
               Louis was indisposed, and Adrienne was commanded to devote the greater portion of her time to his amusement. During those days the poor youth made her repeat to him again and again the story of Christ, his wonderful teachings, and marvelous healing of the sick and afflicted, and his benighted mind seemed to open to something like a true comprehension of the great lesson inculcated by the life and death of the Saviour. Adrienne little dreamed that this poor wreck would yet revive to a new life under the influence of free air and an invigorating climate, and of all the experience of the past, this little seed dropped by the wayside would be the sole remaining vestige of his former existence; that its influence would mold the future destiny of the man. 
               On the third evening, soon after she retired to her own room, M. Lecour summoned her to his apartment. She almost trembled to seek his presence, but as no alternative but obedience remained, she nerved her shrinking courage and went immediately to him. 
               He nodded to her as she entered, and seemed in a better humor than she had ever before seen him. He rubbed his hands together with an air of exultation, and abruptly said: 
               "I sent for you, Mademoiselle, to ask you how you would like to leave this old den, and lead the life of a gay and dashing belle?" 
               She looked wonderingly at him, with the fear that he had gone quite mad, and quietly replied: 
               "I see no possible chance for that, Monsieur, and therefore I must endeavor to render myself contented here." 
               "Contented, child, don't try to play the gentle Griselda with me. It's not in a woman's nature to be satisfied to live in a haunted ruin like this, with such companions as you have here. Do you know that you are very handsome, Adrienne? that you might fascinate almost any man by the charm of your manner?" 
               She half smiled, and he went on: 
               "Yes, yes; you are handsome enough to grace any station, and if my plans succeed, you shall have a lofty one. Yes, you shall be Queen of France yet. Think of it! Queen of the greatest realm in Europe." 
               Adrienne now felt that he was mad. She replied: 
               "I cannot understand you, mon pre. I have no ambitious aspirations. I do not wish to wear a crown." 
               "Then you are a greater fool than I believe you to be," he rudely responded. "I say that if I can put a crown upon your brow I shall certainly do so, and compel you to wear it." 
               Adrienne faintly smiled: 
               "There is so little chance that you shall ever be able to do so, that I need not object to the acceptance of the distinction when it actually falls on me." 
                
               "Little chance, indeed! That shows how ignorant you are of what is passing in the outside world. Read those letters, Mademoiselle, and then see what you think of my power." 
               M. Lecour pointed to several sheets of paper closely written, which lay open on the table. A glance revealed to Adrienne that the first she took up was from the most distinguished man in France. It had been written by his own hand, and with breathless interest she read the details of a plan for restoring Louis XVII. to his inheritance, while the actual power was wielded by Napoleon. 
               As the price of his treachery, M. Lecour was offered the decoration of the Legion of Honor, the position of Counsellor of State, with the title of Due in the new order of nobility that would be established, and large estates to support his new dignity. 
               He watched her eagerly as she read, and when she had finished, he exultingly asked: 
               "What do you think now, Mademoiselle? A few days ago I regarded you as a nuisance and a burden to me; but when a man suddenly finds himself the possessor of a hereditary title, with manorial rights to sustain its prestige, he begins to think something of his descendants, especially when they may attain to loftier hights than he has gained. Can you not see the crown shining in the air above your head, ready to fall upon it, and give you the place once held by Marie Antoinette?" 
               "Remember how it was replaced by the crown of martyrdom," replied Adrienne, with a shudder. "No, mon pre, the crown of France will never be worn by me. I see to what your wishes point; but Louis is unfit for the place into which ambitious men would thrust him to serve their own purposes; and, from the tenor of what you have already revealed to me, I thought that you are pledged to keep him out of the path of his uncle." 
                
               "What politician ever keeps a pledge when his interests are at stake?" he scornfully asked. "A limited monarchy is now the only one the people of France will accept, and it matters not whether the head of that is a fool or a wise man. Other people, who are fitted for it, attend to the business of the nation, and the king is only a gilded puppet, set up with sufficient authority in his name to hold together the different branches of government. For that purpose Louis is as good as any other." 
               "But what has become of your republicanism, since you are willing to restore a kingly ruler to France?" 
               M. Lecour shrugged his shoulders. 
               "The people have proved themselves unfit for self-government, and a limited monarchy is a very different thing from the old despotism wielded by the rulers of France. Besides, when a man becomes a Due, and a counsellor of state, he is apt to modify his republican ideas. I do not profess to be better than the million. I warred upon the aristocrats because they looked down on me, and I hated them; but now it is different. A new race has sprung up in my native land, and among the best of them I shall take my place as an equal-nay, a superior to most of them, if my grand-daughter is elevated to the throne." 
               Adrienne listened like one in a dream. When he at length paused, she deprecatingly said: 
               "And do you think that I could be so untrue to every womanly feeling, as to bestow my hand on the imbecile shadow who lives in yonder room? Even a return to the convent would be better than such a fate as that." 
               "Wait a while, Mademoiselle, and see what your decision will be when you see the road to such distinction lying open before you. I am only preparing the way for you to step into it in good time. I have been for some time past making arrangements for my return to France, accompanied by Prince Louis. I have too long vegetated in this miserable corner of the world. In my early days I played a brilliant part in life, and I intend hereafter to enact a more distinguished one yet. I am not too old-ha! no. I am scarcely sixty, and I have twenty good years yet before me." 
               Adrienne looked on the scarred and battered front of this veteran in crime, and shuddered to think that the crowning infamy of his life was about to be perpetrated, by dragging from his asylum the helpless imbecile who had been committed to his keeping, and placing him in so conspicuous a position that all the world could jeer at his failings. 
               He went on: 
               "At last I can redeem my pledge to the hapless Queen of France. I restore her son to his people, and give him back his inheritance. It is a good deed, and my conscience approves it." 
               His conscience! Had he ever possessed such an inconvenient appendage? and if so, what had become of it through all his past years? Adrienne was too much bewildered by the sudden change in her probable future to find anything to say, and he talked on. 
               "I am compelled to take you into my confidence at this stage of my proceedings, for the hour of our departure draws near, and you must be prepared to accompany me without delay. Look through the wardrobe of Madame Lecour and select such things as may be of use to you on your voyage. Once in your native land, your wants shall be liberally supplied; but there are jewels and laces here that must not be forgotten, for they will be necessary to your future state. The house I shall leave in the charge of Eady, and I shall hereafter write to my overseer, and inform him what disposition to make of the things I shall be compelled to leave behind me." 
               "And it is your fixed purpose to go back to France immediately?" 
                
               "A ship now lies near the mouth of the Mississippi river, which has been sent there by the command of the First Consul, with orders to await my arrival at the Balize. To-morrow night a boat will await me three miles below this place, to which the prince will be conveyed by two men in my confidence. You and I will accompany him, and in twelve more days we will be safe on our way to France and its throne." 
               "It seems like a dream to me," said Adrienne, vaguely. "If Louis will not consent to this change in his destiny, how will you accomplish it?" 
               "I shall not submit such a question to his narrow capacity. I shall mix a powerful narcotic with his wine, and he will be transferred to the boat in a state of unconsciousness. Madame la Reine, do you not now see the shimmer of your future diadem? Ah! I have brave gems with which to set it, and they shall all be yours." 
               "That diadem will never be worn by me," replied Adrienne, with firmness. "Leave me here with Eady; give me a home in Louisiana, with a bare support from your wealth, and I shall prefer it to the royal misery to which it is your ambition to elevate me. I am not ambitious, and splendor, bought at such a price, would be but degradation." 
               M. Lecour regarded her in stern silence. At length he slowly said: 
               "It is not for any love for you that I seek to lift you from the mire in which you are willing to grovel, but to aggrandize my descendants, and give them a lofty position in the land of my birth. Had I other children, I could choose from them, on which this honor should fall; but you are my only one, and I give you no choice in the matter. Ah! will it not be a proud thought to me, that one of my plebeian race shall wear the crown of the haughty Bourbons? that her children may sit upon the throne? Ha! I should never be willing to die, if I could behold such exaltation to my posterity. 
               "Understand, Mademoiselle, that in your individual self you are nothing. It is only as the heiress of my honors, the wife of the king I shall place upon the throne, that you are of the least consequence to me." 
               Adrienne listened with stunned and bewildered feelings. So much that was out of the common course of events had happened during the brief days of her sojourn at Bellair, that she began to think that nothing would surprise her. The experience of the last week had been so marvellous as to prepare her for any caprice of fate, but it seemed hard to her that she was to be hurried away in this mysterious manner, just as her lover was about to arrive in Louisiana. 
               If she submitted to go with M. Lecour, when, and under what circumstances, would they ever meet again? Who could tell? for once in the power of this despotic old man, who could foresee what her future fate might be? She thought, with a cold shudder of repulsion, that he might even accomplish his nefarious plan of bestowing her hand on the idiotic Louis, in defiance of all the opposition she might offer; for how could she, a helpless and dependent girl, withstand the powerful influences that might be brought to bear upon her. Finding that she did not reply to him, M. Lecour went on in an irritated manner: 
               "What have you to say, Mademoiselle? Will you be ready to accompany me at the appointed time, or will you again elope, as you did from the Lady Abbess, and this time throw yourself into the arms of Adolphe Mendon? Will you betray my plans to him, and attempt to circumvent them? Ha! the last will be impossible, and you would be a fool if you exchanged Louis XVII., even without an idea to bless himself with, for a petty planter who has not a sou of his own to support you on." 
                
               "I shall never marry M. Mendon, nor have I any thought of treachery toward you, mon pre. Since I have voluntarily cast in my lot with yours, I suppose it is my duty to abide by you; but if any other path seemed open to me, I frankly say that I should enter it." 
               "That is well; go with me, and the rest is easily managed. Have you forgotten your lover, Adrienne? You will find Du Vernay in your native land, and that should be an inducement to you to wish to return there. When I have made you Queen, you can summon him to your court, heap honors and emoluments on him, and thus repay him for the wrong you will be compelled to do him." 
               "I have relinquished my lover," said Adrienne, in a low voice. "I no longer claim his troth." 
               "Ah-h-and why is that, pray? How long since that heart-breaking operation was performed?" 
               "It is exactly three days, Monsieur, since I wrote to him, refusing his hand on grounds which I cannot explain to you." 
               "Why not, pray?" 
               "Because it will uselessly arouse your anger, and before very long you must learn why I felt compelled to give up the hope of ever becoming Victor Du Vernay's wife." 
               "Truly, you deal in riddles, Mademoiselle; but I can wait to have this one solved, since it is of little interest to me. That is the reason you have looked so heart-broken for the last few days. I thought the tedium of the solitary old house, and your fear of me, were depressing your spirits. I had no idea it was a sentimental love trouble. Never mind, daughter mine, you shall be brilliantly consoled." 
               To Adrienne there was something inexpressibly revolting in this acknowledgment of the tie that united them, and she wondered what had become of her wish to devote her life to the amelioration of this old man's lot. Her feelings had undergone a total revulsion during the few days she had passed near him, and she could not rekindle the enthusiasm which had decked him in attractive colors to her imagination as the venerable and desolate parent of the mother she had lost in her infancy. She internally rebelled against the thought that she belonged to him, and he had a right to demand obedience to his wishes. 
               M. Lecour silently regarded her while these thoughts passed through her mind, and he at length musingly said: 
               "I have had strong doubts of your affinity to me, Adrienne, and I have almost hoped that you would prove to be other than the child of my daughter, but now it is no longer so. I see the use ambitious people may make of their children; you are a power in my hands, to be used for my own aggrandizement. Through you I can increase my own importance, and in time, if you gratify my ambitious aspirations, I have no doubt I shall come to regard you as much as other people regard their descendants." 
               It suddenly occurred to Adrienne to ask: 
               "Are you the only one responsible for my future destiny? What has become of my father? I have never been told of his death." 
               Anger flashed from the eyes that looked on her, and an expression of fierce hatred swept over his face as he spoke through his closed teeth. 
               "If he is living he has no claim on you, for he has for years permitted me, much as I hated and despised his whole race, to bear the burden of his child's support. He shall not now interfere with my plans, by asserting authority he has so long ignored." 
               "Why do you hate him thus? Cannot time and death atone for the wrong he committed against you?" 
               "No!" he thundered. "I hate him for more reasons than one. He came of a family that looked down on mine, and I brook no man's contempt. For three generations the sons of the aristocratic beggars and the rich plebeians were at feud with each other. Hatred was our transmitted heirloom, and then, that my child should have clasped hands in marriage with my hereditary foeman was too deadly a wrong to be forgiven. The curse I hurled upon her broke her soft heart, but I have never regretted that it was not revoked. No-though she died in her youth, the doom was good enough for the ingrate child. Never again speak of your father to me. I hate him now with as deadly venom as when I first learned that he had stolen my daughter from her convent to wed her to his poverty." 
               "Did you love my mother?" asked Adrienne. "Oh, if such a feeling ever found a place in your heart, how could you cast her off, and leave her to her sad fate?" 
               His lip contemptuously curled, and he replied, with stoical calmness: 
               "I have loved nothing on this earth but my own will. Once I went wild over the rights of man, and battled with good will for the equality of the masses; but it was not that I loved them, so much as I hated their oppressors. I had felt the pride of the aristocrat grinding into my soul, and it was my own individual wrongs that nerved my arm, and made me one of the most relentless among the revolutionists. See, what it all came to at last! The people have again sunk to their level, and a new batch of nobility will soon take the place of the old. Hem! I begin to feel quite like an aristocrat myself, with my new honors, and my fine fortune. Le Duc de Bellair-ah! that will sound grand, for I believe I will distinguish the old place by tacking its name to my title." 
               This inclination to be facetious was a new phase in M. Lecour's character, and pained and revolted as Adrienne was, she forced a smile as she replied: 
                
               "No doubt your honors will sit well upon you, Monsieur, for you do not look as if you are of plebeian descent, and you have pride enough to bear yourself as if all the blood of the Montmorencys flows in your veins. But pray pardon me for recurring to my mother. I have yearned so tenderly to learn something of her childhood and youth, but the superior would never answer my inquiries in a satisfactory manner." 
               "Because there was nothing particular to tell," he drily said. "Her history, so far as I know it, can be summed up in a few words. I married Estelle's mother because her lands joined those given me by my father. I had no particular fancy for her silly little face, and she expected more attention from me than I was willing to give. She soon fretted herself into a consumption, and died. Luckily there was but one child, and I put her in a convent to be educated, with the intention of keeping her there for life. Estelle was like every other young miss, I suppose, ready to listen to the first passable looking man that made sentimental speeches to her. So she abused the confidence of the abbess, and found an early grave as the reward of her disobedience. She was like her mother, silly and softhearted; but you do not resemble her in that respect. You have mind and strength. It will take a great deal to break your heart; therefore I shall not scruple to make you Queen of France, for no such fatal results will follow the sacrifice as happened to your mother." 
               Adrienne flushed as she replied: 
               "Spirit and heart will both be broken before that result is attained. Do not take me to France with the idea that you can bend me to your purpose. If I am your descendant, I am entitled to a portion of your own indomitable spirit, and I feel it strong within me to defend the inalienable right of every woman to choose the man to whom her hand shall be given in marriage." 
                
               "Ha! do you venture to bandy threats with me? Have a care, Mademoiselle; do not forget that if the tiger puts forth a velvet paw, beneath that soft covering are talons that can rend." 
               Adrienne regarded him silently a few moments, and then burst into tears. She sobbed: 
               "Oh, mon pre, how tenderly I hoped to love you! how dutifully I could have ministered to you, had you permitted me to retain my faith in the goodness of the old man I came to seek. But you have sought in every way to disenchant and alienate me. I do not threaten; no-I only defend myself from the possibility of a fate that would be worse than death to me." 
               "Adrienne," he harshly replied, "I detest scenes; tears have lost their effect with me. Since you belong to me-are dependent on me for the very bread you eat-I shall dispose of you as I think best for your future welfare. It may not be feasible to give your hand to Louis, for others as ambitious as I am will have a voice in disposing of him. It is barely within the range of possibility that I may be able to accomplish such a marriage, and it was premature and ill-judged in me to develop my ambitious dreams to you. Since you are so strongly opposed to this union, dismiss it from your mind as an idle vision of mine." 
               Adrienne would have thanked him for this assurance, but he impatiently waved his hand, and went on: 
               "Make your preparations for departure with secrecy and dispatch; and be careful that no hint of the change about to take place escapes you to any one in this house. Be guarded before the prince, and do not permit Eady to suspect what you are about. I shall leave behind me sealed directions for the overseer, which will fully explain my wishes as to the management of my Louisiana property. And now I bid you good-night." 
                
               Thus dismissed, Adrienne sought her own room, to reflect on the extraordinary communication of the evening, and to endeavor to decide which course would be best for her future well being-to go with M. Lecour, or claim the protection of Father Eustace. 
               Since her fate was severed from that of Victor Du Vernay, happiness she believed no longer within her reach. The thought of a return to her old prison filled her with dread, and she felt certain that the priest would send her back to her convent as soon as he found her in his power. A marriage with M. Mendon was equally repulsive to her, and the final decision was that she would go with her grandfather, and share the brilliant future that seemed opening to him. She believed that a powerful party would array itself in opposition to the elevation of a girl of plebeian descent to be the sharer of the throne, and little did Adrienne imagine that M. Lecour had decided in his own mind that her hand should be given to Louis before they reached France, thus defeating such party influence as might be brought to bear against his own selfish scheme of aggrandizement. 
               Adrienne was full of life, youth and hope, and she knew very well that in her beauty, tact, and charm of manner, she possessed much to ensure a brilliant future. M. Du Vernay held a high position in the government of the First Consul, and she began to indulge the hope that her separation from her lover would not be final, although she had so recently written to Victor to hope no more. She was conscious that as the prospective heiress of the Due de Bellair, her position would be very different from that she occupied as the scarcely acknowledged grandchild of an eccentric recluse, who had manifested no interest in her destiny beyond the payment of the pittance which had secured her a shelter in the convent. 
                
               If Du Vernay was willing to overlook the former career of her grandfather, in the dazzle of his present success, why should she dash from her lips the cup of happiness brimming with so sparkling a draught? She had not strength to do so, and she half regretted her recent letter. It would needlessly harrow poor Victor's heart, and might lead to a temporary estrangement. 
               While Adrienne thus mused, M. Lecour silently matured his plans, with the assurance in his own mind that he should bring them to a successful termination, and while she dreamed of the possibility of a reunion with her lover, the hoary old regicide made up his mind that in defiance of any opposition she might offer, Adrienne should land in France only as the wedded wife of Louis XVII. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XX. 
               A CLANDESTINE VISIT TO THE OLD CHATEAU IN WHICH AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IS MADE. 
               HOURS passed away in reflection, and unconscious of the laspe of time, Adrienne sat beside her dying fire, dreaming of the uncertain future before her, when suddenly there was a sound outside of her door, as if some one was endeavoring to open it. She started up in alarm, for in compliance with the command of M. Lecour the key had been placed in the keeping of Eady since the night of her visit to his picture-room, and she had no means of securing it from within. 
               With eyes dilating with apprehension, she gazed on the door, unable to utter a sound from the nerveless horror that fell on her, lest it should again unclose to reveal the White Terror to her shrinking sight. 
               At length it slowly opened, and in place of the pale phantom she had feared to behold, a very black, scared face was thrust into the opening. With a feeling of intense relief, Adrienne exclaimed: 
               "It is only you, Eady. What has happened? Why do you come to me at this hour of the night?" 
               "Oh lor'! I 'spected to fin' you in your bed fas' asleep at dis hour, an' thar you is, lookin' as white as de ghose herself. I's come for you to go wi' me to de room of de prince. He's tuck a turn, an' he'll die afore morin' ef I carn't git suffin' to relieve him." 
               "What can have made him worse? Have you called my grandfather?" 
               "'Taint no use to do dat; de poor helpless creetur is subjec' to cramps in his breas', an' I knows it's caze he eats too much, an' carn't take no ex'cise. I knows well enough what to do for him, but he keeps a callin' for you, so I thought I'd better come arter you." 
               "I thought you said he was in danger?" 
               "Well-mebbe he is, an' mebbe he aint. I knows what to give him as well as de marster does, for I has cured him o' wuss turns den dis one. Kin you come along o' me a little while, an' speak to the poor boy?" 
               Adrienne could not refuse to comply with this request, and she immediately followed Eady, When she reached the ante-room she found Pierre there awaiting their appearance, and heard from the inner chamber the groans of Louis mingled with entreaties to bring la comtesse to him. When Adrienne approached him, he put out his hand and said: 
               "Ask your good man, your bon dieu to help me. Oh I suffer! I suffer!" 
               She gathered from Eady that Louis had refused to take from her hand the remedies she had prepared; she spoke as soothingly to him as she would have done to a spoiled child, and soon succeeded in inducing him to swallow the potion. 
               She then lightly passed her hands over his face, and in a few moments saw the look of suffering relax, and the sallow features sink into their usual passive state of repose. Just before he fell asleep he looked tenderly in her face, and said: 
               "You are my good angel, comtesse. Be always near me-always, and I shall grow stronger and happier for your presence." 
               Adrienne shrank away at this avowal, and a shudder thrilled her frame at the thought that her strong young life was to become the sacrifice to this miserable wreck of humanity. The wishes of Louis evidently took the same direction as those of M. Lecour, and the poor girl began to feel as if a net was closing around her, from which there would soon be no means of escape. 
               She had spoken truly-she had no ambition which could lead her to such a sacrifice as this. The misfortunes of the prince filled her with compassion, and she felt a strong desire to alleviate his condition as far as lay in her power; but to give him her hand, to become the sharer of his wretched existence, was a prospect that filled her with horror. Yet M. Lecour had said that such was to be her fate, and she feared that he would stop at nothing to accomplish what he had set his heart on. 
               Eady at length remarked how pale and worn out she looked, and she insisted that Adrienne should retire to her own room, while she kept watch beside the sleeping youth. Since she saw her presence was no longer needed, the young girl consented to seek the repose of which she stood greatly in need. 
                
               Eady had brought a small lantern with her, which she relighted for Adrienne's use. The old woman would have accompanied her to the door, but she declined her escort, fearing that Louis might awake during her absence and need her services. 
               Pierre had fallen sound asleep on a chair in the ante-room, and his young lady left him to the enjoyment of his slumbers, for she feared that the sound of his heavy footsteps upon the staircase might arouse M. Lecour, and probably fill him with wrath when he learned that his ward had been ill, and he had not been summoned to his bedside, for no one could tell what turn his capricious and uncertain temper might take, nor on whose head the brunt of his anger might fall. 
               The lantern Adrienne carried, threw a flickering and uncertain light before her; it just sufficed to show her the way she must go, and to render the darkness beyond more palpable. As she descended the lower flight of stairs, she suddenly started and drew back, for she thought she saw the outline of a heavy muffled form standing at its foot. 
               She flashed the lantern in that direction, but it was no longer there, and with a rapidly beating heart Adrienne went on, assuring herself that the shadows had deceived her. She little dreamed that from their depths a pair of piercing eyes were fixed upon her; that noiseless steps tracked her to her very door, and saw her enter. 
               When the spy returned, he lightly ascended toward the upper story, and guided by the snoring of Pierre, soon found his way to the ante-room. A glance at the sleeping black assured him that he might pass him with impunity, and he glided to the half-open door of the inner chamber. 
               Eady sat rocking to and fro, with her back towards the entrance, and the stranger was thus enabled to survey the room at his leisure. 
                
               The eyes of M. Mendon flashed with exultation as they fell on the face of the sleeping Louis, and he thought: 
               "I have fairly won her now, and one more effort shall surely make her mine. How fair and attractive she looked by that dim light, as she glided by me with that half-startled expression on her face. I might have thought her Louise herself, so marvelous is the resemblance between them. I wonder if the priest uttered all the truth? He said he was the father of Estelle Lecour's child, but he only left me to infer that Adrienne is that child. Suppose she is really the heiress; I believe she is, and Father Eustace claims her as his own to make sure of his share of the estate. No-no, I believe that was the child of Louise who passed me just now." 
               As these thoughts passed through his mind, M. Mendon noiselessly threaded his way to the lower part of the house. The last words were unconsciously muttered half aloud, as he rapidly approached the private entrance by which he had made his way into the house. 
               A deep, long-drawn sigh seemed to be uttered in response to his words, and unseen lips breathed "Yes, yes, yes," close beside his ear. 
               He turned, and suddenly threw out his arms, but they came in contact with nothing, and for a second he stood transfixed with the thrilling consciousness that the voice which he had believed long hushed in death, had spoken audibly to him. Strong man as he was, a cold terror fell upon him, and he felt his hair rising upon his temples. He looked piercingly around to discover if possible what had breathed those words; the moon had just risen, and a level bar of light fell through a decayed shutter at the lower end of the hall which gave a feeble illumination to its somber extent. Across this he saw a white shadow flit, to be lost in the gloom beyond, and M. Mendon knew that he had obtained a glimpse of the White Terror which was known to haunt the chateau. 
               He was not a superstitious man, but he hurried from the spot with a strong feeling of thankfulness at his escape from the old ruin. The door through which he obtained egress was built in the wall of one of the lower rooms which had been long disused. It had been placed there by his brother, and the fastenings so contrived that he could admit himself from without at any hour of the night, for the habits of Eugene Mendon had not been regular, and the annoyance betrayed by M. Montreuil when he became aware of the late hours kept by his son-in-law, led to the construction of this private entrance. Louise, the gentle and the true, kept from her father the knowledge of her husband's frequent absences, although she knew that his passion for gambling had made serious inroads in their fortune. 
               From boyhood M. Mendon had known the secret of the spring which held the door fastened, and on approaching it he had expected to find the pathway choked with shrubbery and undergrowth. To his surprise he found it open, and bearing evident marks of having been recently cleared. Why this should have been done he could not decide, but it would evidently be of great service in successfully carrying out the enterprise he was about to undertake. He hurried through the thick woodland and mounted his horse, which he had left fastened upon its outskirts. 
               A wild ride brought him back to Corona in two hours, and his panting steed was hurriedly put in the stable, before he sought the presence of Father Eustace. 
               The priest was still sitting up, evidently in a state of expectation, for at the first sound of the footsteps of his late visitor, he arose from his chair and unlocked his door. 
               He surveyed M. Mendon with a scrutinizing glance as he approached the table and threw off his hat. He said: 
                
               "I see from your face that you have not failed. How is it, my son? Were my suspicions correct?" 
               "They were. I have fulfilled my pledge, father. I made my way into the house, and as my good fortune willed it, Louis himself was seized with illness just before I reached there. They were compelled to have lights in his room, and by their glimmer I found my way to his very door." 
               "And he was really there?" 
               "Really and truly, surrounded by such royal trappings as would be calculated to amuse his fatuous mind. I have not a doubt that the youth I saw lying in helpless lethargy upon his couch was Louis of France." 
               The priest cordially grasped his hand. 
               "You have fairly won your reward, my son, and you shall wear it. To-morrow night we must be ready to remove this poor lad, for I have certain information that M. Lecour intends to do the same thing himself. His emissaries are to be at Bellair at eleven o'clock; we must be there at nine. His arrangements play admirably into our hands, for he will doubtless stupefy the poor prince with narcotics, to enable them to remove him without disturbance. Thus the most delicate part of the abduction is provided for beforehand." 
               "Do you still insist that Mademoiselle Adrienne must be left behind? I feel a strange unwillingness to do so." 
               "Tush! nonsense! It is absolutely necessary that she shall remain. We can remove Louis without the knowledge of it coming to M. Lecour before we have time to escape with him beyond the chances of pursuit. But if Adrienne were to become the companion of his flight, he would learn it in a few moments, for he is too suspicious to lose sight of her long at such a crisis. Besides, she might object to coming away with us herself, and we have no time to waste in persuasion. It is the purpose of M. Lecour to take her with him to France, for arrangements are made to receive a lady on the boat that is awaiting his movements." 
               M. Mendon regarded him with surprise: he asked 
               "How do you obtain such accurate information, father?" 
               "The means were placed at my command before I undertook this enterprise," he coldly replied, and the interrogator saw that he did not choose to be more explicit. 
               M. Mendon was compelled to submit to the reasoning of the priest, but he had many misgivings for the safety of Adrienne, and he resolved in his own mind that he would return to Bellair as speedily as possible after securing the safety of Louis, to look after her, and, if necessary, to rescue her at once from the power of her grandfather. 
               The plans of the confederates were finally adjusted, and the two retired to rest a few hours, preparatory to the labors of the important day which was soon to dawn on them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               A SUCCESSFUL ABDUCTION. 
               AT an early hour Adrienne arose, and went to the room of Louis to ascertain how he had passed the latter part of the night. She found him sleeping heavily, and Eady nodding in her chair beside his couch. 
               The fallen features of the Prince betrayed the sufferings of the past hours, and she began to fear that this attack was the commencement of a fatal illness. While she stood attentively regarding him, he unclosed his eyes, gazed wildly at her, and then began to mutter disconnected sentences. They evidently referred to the experience of his most miserable childhood, for he exclaimed, in an agonized tone: 
                
               "Do not take me from her-my mother grasps me-she will not let me go-I will starve myself if you tear me from her." 
               Then, after a pause, he said: 
               "Oh, Simon, I cannot. Mercy-mercy, it is my mother's blood. Look-look how it covers me. Oh-h-h-don't beat me again-pray don't-I will work. Oh, Lord, I am a poor miserable child! will no one help me?" 
               Such were the pathetic exclamations that at intervals burst from his poor lips as those torturing memories came back to him. 
               Adrienne knelt down beside him, and placed one cool hand upon his feverish brow, while with the other she fanned his face. The evil influence seemed laid at rest by her ministrations, for soon he slept again, and a tranquil smile stole over his face. 
               Eady left the sick youth under her care, and went to attend to her usual duties. Soon afterward M. Lecour came up, and with an expression of annoyance inquired into the particulars of Louis' seizure. Adrienne informed him of all she knew, and he severely reprimanded her for not informing him immediately. She made no reply, because she believed he would have been still more irritated if he had been interrupted in the night. 
               When he had exhausted all the vituperation he could on Eady, Pierre and herself, as a trio of stupid creatures, Adrienne quietly said: 
               "You will not think of moving Prince Louis while he is in this dangerous condition?" 
               "Indeed I shall. I cannot alter my plans, and he will be better off in the ship, for there he will have the care of a surgeon. With you to nurse him, there is no fear but he will get along well enough. My arrangements brook no delay, and Louis must be in Paris in six weeks from this day." 
                
               "He needs medical aid now; he is evidently in a dangerous condition, and I am sure if his life is so important to you in the future, it is best to have him attended to immediately." 
               "I am physician enough for him yet awhile. I have studied medicine, and I have used my skill on Louis before to-day. I will prepare some drops for him which you can administer. They will soon produce a reaction, and when he awakes from the heavy sleep into which it is my purpose to throw him, he will be like a different person." 
               She timidly inquired: 
               "Are you not afraid that a powerful narcotic acting upon his weakened brain may produce entire alienation of mind?" 
               "The drug I shall give him will produce alienation of memory for a season, and that at the present crisis will be an advantage. Let the result be what it may, it must be given to him, for on its effects depends the success of his removal to-night. To you I commit the task of administering it, and I shall hold you responsible if he is not wrapped in sleep that cannot be broken by eleven o'clock to-night." 
               Thus peremptorily commanded, Adrienne had no other resource than to obey; but when a small vial filled with a pale, greenish liquid was soon after brought to her by Pierre, she held it in her hand many moments before she could make up her mind to obey the injunctions laid on her. 
               M. Lecour sent written directions with it. 
               "Give Louis three drops every hour till twilight; then double the dose till he lies so deeply locked in sleep that it will be impossible to arouse him. See that you obey me to the letter, for any failure on your part will be severely dealt with by E. L." 
               She dared not evade this positive command, and with a prayer for forgiveness if it should prove injurious to him, she poured out the designated quantity and forced it between the pale lips of the suffering Louis. 
               He unclosed his eyes, smiled feebly, and with an interval of consciousness, said: 
               "I would have taken anything from your hand, comtesse. Offer the draught to me, and I will drink it myself the next time." 
               "Pardon me, my Prince, I thought you were unconscious." 
               "No, not entirely. I know you-I love you already. Kiss me, my pretty one, and when I die I will look in heaven for an angel as lovely as you are, to give your kiss to." 
               "Give it to my mother," said Adrienne, as she bent down and pressed her lips upon the sallow brow of the poor youth. She believed he would die, for in his condition she thought it would be impossible to remove him without producing fatal consequences from the fever that burned in his veins. He pressed her hand, fell off to sleep, and remained in that condition till he was again aroused to take his medicine. Eady brought her coffee and toast about ten o'clock, and informed her that M. Lecour wished to see her in his own apartment. 
               In a few moments Adrienne obeyed the summons. On entering his room, she found M. Lecour engaged in packing, and, to her surprise, the table was covered with jewels of such beauty and lustre as almost dazzled her vision. Diamonds, emeralds, and rubies lay before her, and she could not resist the exclamation: 
               "How beautiful! Oh, mon pre, where did you get all those lovely gems?" 
               "Where? everywhere. Know, Adrienne, that my father followed the honorable calling of a usurer. People called him a banker, but the other was the right name for the kind of business he did. I followed it after him, and a pretty penny I turned in those days when the aristocrats were glad to get a tithe of the value of their family jewels, that they might buy bread. Each of these gems has its history, and if they could speak, a fearful tale would many of them tell of anguish, terror, and despair." 
               Adrienne had taken up a bracelet, but at these words she laid it back with a shudder, and said: 
               "They are ominous possessions, in spite of their beauty. Now I know their history, I should be afraid to deck myself with them." 
               "Humph! you say so now; but wait awhile till you have made your dbt in the saloons of Paris. Then see how eager you will be for the possession of these glittering follies. I am packing them for your use. A parure of those diamonds, as a cadeau to the First Consul's wife, may facilitate our way to royal state, and Josephine would grace them well. These once belonged to Madame du Barri, and were given to me almost for a song, in the mad hope that I could save her from the fate of all her class." 
               Adrienne turned away from them, as she said, with some disdain: 
               "The least noble of the victims that perished was better worth saving than she, for her vicious prodigality helped to prepare the way of the innocent Louis to the scaffold." 
               "Well-yes, perhaps so; but I forget why I sent for you. I wish you to bring me from your room the three sets of jewels that are kept in the cabinet there. They belonged to Madame Lecour, and I have not removed them, but now it becomes necessary to do so. I cannot leave such valuable articles behind me." 
               Adrienne soon returned with the boxes, and with evident shrinking he unclosed them, to ascertain if the gems were all there. The pearls and diamonds he scarcely glanced at, but the opals he held long in his hand, turning them from side to side, to catch the iridiscent reflections that flashed from them. At length he abruptly said: 
               "These stones always bring to my mind the Englishman's extraordinary story of Vathek. The burning heart is here well typified, gleaming beneath the finely polished surface, like scathing memories beneath the smooth outward polish of conventionalism. Oh! this is a rare world we live in. What is your opinion of it, Adrienne?" 
               "I know too little of it to venture an opinion," she replied. "But I have the belief that it is a very good world to those that make the right use of it, for when God surveyed his work, he pronounced it good, therefore it must be so." 
               "Hem, well-I only hope you may find it so. I have not found it either a good or a pleasant place to live in, I assure you." 
               "Then I am sorry for you, mon pre, for you have long dwelt in it. Your hair is silvered, and your form begins to bend. It is dreadful that you do not find your long life pleasant to look back on." 
               She spoke dreamily, as if her thoughts were wandering over that sombre record of crime and evil doing, and M. Lecour flashed on her one of his most rancorous glances, as he said: 
               "I do not think that God has given you much more sense than he has granted to the royal dunce I intend to make your husband, or you would scarcely talk to a newly created due of his age. Age! forsooth! I am only sixty, and with my thews and sinews I am good for eighty years of life, perhaps ninety, or a century-who knows?" 
               Adrienne looked at him with surprise. She simply said: 
                
               "I did not know that you consider life so precious. I have thought you have little to attach you to it." 
               "Little-so I had a few days ago, but now I am a noble. Ha! ha! a noble! and I intend to live long to enjoy my honors and my wealth. I have hoards unknown to any one, that I will now lavish with a prodigal hand. I will live in imperial style; my palaces, my horses, my jewels shall rival those of the king himself. Ha! what was that?" 
               The last exclamation was produced by a thrilling pain which shot through his left arm, and traversed his heart, followed by a sensation of numbness. For an instant he thought that the grim conqueror had laid his touch upon him even at the moment he was boasting of his strength; but the suffering passed away, and with it the momentary apprehension it had aroused. He put aside the opals, as he said, in a more subdued tone: 
               "Those stones once adorned the Princess de Lamballe-she who, for her faithful attachment to the queen, was torn in pieces by the mob of Paris." 
               "And how did they come into your possession?" asked Adrienne with a shudder she could not repress. 
               "They were stolen in the sack of her father's chateau: the man in whose hands they fell offered them to me in the way of trade, and of course I took them at my own price. See, child, the gems that lie on that table are worth a million. Do you think I could have purchased them at anything like their true value?" 
               "I thought you were poor when you accepted the charge of Louis and brought him hither?" 
               "Yes-I certainly was poor, for in these days the jewels could not have found purchasers. I should have been compelled to sacrifice them, and I was resolute not to do so. I believed the time must come when they would be important to me. It has arrived, and I have not kept them in vain. But go, child. Look over your finery, and choose such things as you may wish to claim. Once in Paris, and you shall be supplied with the most expensive nonsense the milliners and mantua makers can fashion. Yes, yes-you shall have a rare time, my daughter." 
               Adrienne looked at him, and marvelled if she could really stand in that relation toward him. He revolted her finer sensibilities so continually that it seemed to her impossible that she should belong to one of his calibre. She made him no reply, but glided from the room to obey his commands. 
               M. Lecour looked after her, and muttered: 
               "One cannot choose their children; more is the pity, for that girl has none of my spirit in her, though she has plenty of her own, I hardly know how I feel toward her. Sometimes I almost like the child, and again I feel the fire of hatred rising in my heart against her. What is it? a warning?" Is she a malign influence in my house of life? Ah, if so, let her beware! I strike as surely as the cobra capello, and my blow is always deadly. Ha! that pang again! What can it mean?" 
               His eye fell upon the thin red scratch upon his hand, and an expression of horror came upon his features. He whispered: 
               "What if the dog was rabid? Oh, my God! not that! Any other doom than that! Let me see; I will test it" 
               With set teeth, glittering eyes, and cheeks suddenly blanched to deathly pallor, he approached a pitcher and poured water from it into a crystal goblet. A flash of exultation lighted up his face, as he lifted it steadily to his lips, drank a few drops, and replaced it upon the table. 
               "Not too late yet," he muttered. "I was mad not to take every precaution at once." 
               M. Lecour opened a cabinet filled with chemical preparations, took from among them caustic and burned the wound upon his hand, scarring it deeply and painfully to escape from the sudden fear that had fallen on him. Then wrapping it carefully, he addressed himself to his task again. 
               He was busily employed during the greater part of the day, but he evidently kept a keen watch on the movements of Adrienne. Every hour he summoned her to his presence under the pretext of inquiring about the condition of Louis, and ascertaining that she was prompt in administering the drops on which so much depended. 
               Adrienne felt that he did not trust her; that he feared some treachery on her part, impossible as it seemed to her to find means to accomplish it. 
               He also called on her frequently to assist him, and by the time twilight fell she was almost worn out in the service of the two. As the day passed on, she saw with apprehension the effect of the medicine on the sick youth; consciousness seemed gradually fading out, and when night fell, Louis lay still as if already dead, with a heavy dew standing upon his brow, and the faintest respiration issuing from his slightly parted lips. His pulse was scarcely perceptible and his heart beat feebly, though regularly. 
               Toward night, M. Lecour came to his bedside, and examined his condition. A smile of triumph broke over his lips, as he said: 
               "My Indian drug certainly works wonders. It fires my blood to frenzy, and freezes that of this poor failure into numbness. Do not be alarmed, Adrienne. Louis will lie thus many hours, perhaps a day or two, but he will eventually revive to life and fortune. Do not fancy that I would risk the loss of the goose that is to bring me the golden egg." 
               "How will he be removed?" asked Adrienne, apprehensively. 
                
               "A palanquin has been prepared, and in it he can be easily and safely carried to the boat. Do not fear for the result, for everything is carefully arranged to facilitate our passage to the river. All that now remains for you to do, is to be ready at the exact moment to accompany us." 
               "I am quite ready now," she replied; "but oh, mon pre will it be best to take this step? My heart strangely misgives me." 
               "Your heart is soft as your head, you miserable little coward. Leave Jackdaw to take care of this lad, and come to my room. I wish you to read to me till Pierre comes back from the office. I expect the old wretch has got drunk again, and is afraid to come home with my letters." 
               She silently complied, though she was too weary with the various employments of the day to feel able to fulfil his request. He did not choose to remark her lassitude, but kept her thus employed till nearly eight o'clock. M. Lecour then yawned portentously, and said: 
               "Go up now and relieve Jackdaw. Tell her to prepare a strong cup of coffee for me-but beware how you suffer a hint of our intended departure to escape you. Everything now depends on secrecy and diligence. I feel as if I can sleep an hour or two, and I need the refreshment before I set out on our journey." 
               Adrienne went to her apartment, surveyed it, she believed, for the last time, closed and locked the trunk in which she had packed such articles as she intended to take with her, and wearing her hood and shawl, slowly proceeded toward the apartment of Louis. 
               She had been at Bellair scarcely a week, and it seemed to her as if years had passed over her head since she entered it. To say that she was not glad to leave a spot in which she had already suffered so much, would be untrue, yet there was within her heart a vague feeling of sadness as she passed down the private staircase, and stood before the portrait of the hapless Louise, to take one last lingering look at its subdued loveliness. 
               The fading twilight gave her an imperfect view of the sweet face, and she opened the door that she might see it more clearly. She had stood thus but a few moments when she heard the stumbling steps of Pierre, and knew at once that he had returned in the condition anticipated by M. Lecour. She went hurriedly out to meet him, and seeing that he could scarcely stand, Adrienne said to him: 
               "Give me the letters, Pierre, and I will take them up to my grandfather, and spare you the scolding you would get if you were to appear before him in your present condition." 
               "You is a born lady, young mistis," muttered Pierre, as he fumbled in his pocket for the letters, "an' I thank you kindly for your 'tention. I-I's not well 'nuff to go up to de marster, shure 'nuff, but I hopes you won't think dere's anything like drunk de matter of me? Oh, no-nuffin so 'sgraceful as dat." 
               Adrienne smiled faintly as she said, "Very well, I see that something is wrong with you. You had better give me the letters, and get to bed as quickly as possible." 
               "Thank you kindly young mistis, I shall do dat wi' mighty great pleasure." 
               Adrienne took the letters, saw that one was for herself, and the others for M. Lecour. The address on her own gave a great bound to her heart, for she recognized the writing of Victor Du Vernay. One of her grandfather's was also addressed by him, but the other was evidently from some one in the vicinity of Bellair, for it had no post-mark, and she noticed that it was directed in small feminine characters. 
               She lightly tripped up stairs, peeped into his room, and saw that he was already lying fast asleep upon his couch. She noiselessly entered and placed his letters in so conspicuous uous a place that he must see them as soon as he awoke. She then went on her way to the apartment of Louis. 
               Eady was half asleep, and her young lady requested her to light the candles, and then hold herself in readiness to take M. Lecour's coffee to him. He was now sleeping, but would doubtless ring for her before very long." 
               "I wonder he's had patience to wait for his supper till dis unushel time o' de night," said Eady. "But I mus' go an' git it ready to onct, or he'll blaze up agin, be sure." 
               She hurried away, and with a beating heart Adrienne unclosed her letter. She found within it only these words: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "ADRIENNE, I have received those lines addressed to me in such an inconceivable frame of mind as they indicate, and I refuse to give you back your troth, or to accept my own freedom. You are mine, and I will never give you up while life lasts. 
                           "I have seen Madame Noiron, and learned a most extraordinary history which I dare not commit to writing, lest it might fall into the hands of one who is hostile to our interests. You shall soon learn it from my own lips, for I shall be on my way to Bellair in a few hours. I have written to M. Lecour informing him of my intended visit, and the object I have in view in making it. 
                           "A personal interview with him is absolutely necessary, and I am more than willing to seek it, because in so doing I shall find my adored Adrienne. 
                           
                              "Yours truly and unalterably, 
                              "VICTOR DU VERNAY."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Yes, her lover was coming and he would find her gone! Spirited away from him, probably forever, yet she could not evade the fate that menaced her. She felt herself powerless in the hands of this pitiless old man, and vainly did she rebel against the necessity that removed her from her present asylum at the moment it seemed most important to remain. She shed bitter tears over her untoward fate, yet she dared not even leave a line to afford Du Vernay a clue to her whereabouts, lest she should compromise herself with M. Lecour, and bring down his terrible wrath upon her unprotected head. 
               Louis was still lying in the same helpless condition, and the unhappy watcher sat beside his couch in the deep solitude of that large, empty mansion, and brooded over her own helplessness in the position in which she was placed. 
               The stillness of death seemed to have fallen over everything, for not even the hoot of an owl was heard without. Adrienne had scarcely slept throughout the previous night, and during the past day she had performed a degree of labor to which she was unaccustomed. The needs of the physical frame at length overpowered mental suffering, and her head drooped forward on the bed. In a few moments she was wrapped in a profound sleep. 
               She was quite oblivious of the approach of cautious feet, when two figures, clad in dark flowing robes, and wearing inquisitors' caps which entirely concealed their features, entered the room. They drew near, and looked down upon the sleeping girl, without the slightest movement upon her part which betrayed consciousness of their presence. 
               "Ah, this is well," whispered Father Eustace. "It will not now be necessary to use force to prevent her from giving the alarm. She is evidently sleeping from exhaustion, and will not be likely to interrupt us. To work at once, my son, and we shall soon secure our prize." 
               The two noiselessly spread out upon the floor a grass hammock, and placed upon it blankets they bad brought with them for the purpose. Then, leaving undisturbed the coverlet on which the head of the sleeping girl rested, they skilfully wrapped the insensible Louis in the under bed clothing, and transferred him to the couch they had prepared for him. 
               The prince was perfectly passive in their hands, and soon he lay rolled up in the temporary bed thus provided for him, while the two men gathered the knotted ends of the hammock together, and easily lifted the weight between them. 
               As they were about to move away, M. Mendon pointed to Adrienne, and said: 
               "It would be easy to remove her also. I fear to leave her here, after taking Louis away." 
               "It would ruin our whole plan to attempt such a thing. She must remain here a few hours longer, but I pledge myself to claim her as soon as possible in the morning." 
               Compelled to be satisfied with this assurance, M. Mendon turned away with a sigh, and the two lifted their burden from the floor, and passed carefully through the outer apartment. 
               At the foot of the staircase, stood a man with a dark lantern, and the three made their way without interruption to the private entrance. They emerged beneath a star-lit sky, and after a few moments' quick walking stood beside a wagon in which a bed had been placed. 
               The insensible Louis was carefully transferred to this, the priest took the reins from the man who had remained in charge of the vehicle, M. Mendon jumped on the box beside him, and they drove rapidly away. 
               Before doing so, however, the priest issued his orders to the two men he left behind. 
               "Remain near Bellair, and keep a strict watch on those who may visit it to-night. Do not permit us to be pursued. If you should hear any unusual commotion in the house, you had better find means to enter it, and if the young lady who is there, needs protection, give it to her at all hazards. Report to me to-morrow, all that occurs." 
                
               The men only bowed in reply, and silently wended their way toward the same door by which their employer had gained admittance, to establish a strict espionage over the spot. 
               Father Eustace said to M. Mendon: 
               "I trust you are satisfied now. I have amply provided for Adrienne's safety, by leaving those two trusty fellows to watch over it." 
               "Still, I could wish we had brought her with us," was the rejoinder. "I know how unscrupulous, how hard old Lecour is, and I am naturally unwilling that my promised wife shall be left to his merciless rage even for an hour." 
               "He will not dare to injure her after the warning I have left him. Adrienne will be safe, I assure you, for my emissaries will surely protect her. Do not fear that any evil shall happen to the heiress." 
               The sarcastic emphasis on the last word had the effect of silencing M. Mendon, though he bitterly resented the implied taunt. After a pause, he sullenly asked: 
               "If Mademoiselle Durand should refuse to accept me as her husband, what course is it your purpose to pursue?" 
               "I shall act on your first hint, and offer her the choice between the cloister or your hand. Her distaste to a conventual life is so great, that I have no doubt as to the decision she will make." 
               "But if she should be so perverse as to prefer the convent?" 
               "In that case, we can at old Lecour's death, divide the estate. It falls to Adrienne as his heir, and she will have abjured the possession of worldly goods in assuming the vail. I believe the clever trick we have just played on him, will be a finishing stroke to that old reprobate, and we shall not have long to wait for a division of the spoils. I must drive faster, for if we do not reach our boat before eleven, there will be apt to be a wild chase after us." 
                
               He whipped the horses into a gallop, and they were rapidly whirled toward their destination. When they gained the bank of the Mississippi, a wide level road ran along its margin, and after a drive of several miles up the river the priest drew rein near a clump of bushes that concealed a large keel boat, furnished with oars, and a clumsy looking sail. This was to be propelled mainly by hand through the sinuous windings of that rapid stream, to a point near the northern lakes, as its final destination. 
               From that landing, the abducted prince was to be transferred to a family in Canada, which had been prepared to receive him in the place of a son who had recently died. With his imperfect intellect, and shattered memory, it was believed that under new influences every vestige of his past life would soon fade from the mind of Louis, and he would learn to believe himself a true son of the forest, for the woman who was to assume toward him the relation of mother was of the Indian race. 
               Louis was immediately removed to a cabin, which had been prepared for his use, and in it such comforts as were absolutely necessary to him were found. They placed him in the bed, and when the skipper looked at his pale unconscious face, he bluntly asked: 
               "What's to be done wi' the lad, if he dies afore he gits to his landing? He don't look much like seeing the voyage to a eend." 
               Father Eustace replied 
               "You must do the best you can for him, Franois, and if he should die, you must keep a strict account of all that happens, and place a landmark, by means of which his grave may with certainty be found. Your reward, however, will be larger, if he is safely delivered to the agent who will meet you at the final place of debarkation." 
               "Ah, well, I'll do the best I can to keep the breath in him; but he don't look much like coming to life again." 
                
               "He has only taken a powerful opiate. If he sleeps too long, force nourishment into his mouth. He will swallow it mechanically." 
               Thus instructed, the skipper promised all that was required, and the helpless youth was left in the charge of his new custodians. Since Louis will appear no more in our narrative, it will be best here to give a brief detail of his subsequent career. 
               The boat was cast off immediately, and powerful rowers applied their sinews to the task of removing her from that vicinity as soon as possible. A large reward had been paid to the captain and a bonus to the men, both of which were to be doubled at the successful ending of the voyage. 
               In a rough way, everything that was possible was done to promote the welfare of the poor youth, whose fate had already undergone so many sad mutations. For many hours he continued in the same condition in which he had been brought upon the boat; and when he did revive to look around him, the little light that had lately beamed in his eyes was quenched. 
               The new faces and strange objects around him seemed to make no impression, and it was soon evident that the memory of the past was annihilated forever. If the paralyzed mind ever reacted, it would be among new scenes, and with entirely different impressions from those which had hitherto been made upon it, and his past life must remain a blank. 
               His physical health slowly mended, and when he was able to sit up, those rough men lifted him to the deck every bright day, and the open air, the changing shores, and rollicking fun going on among the crew of the boat, produced a marked and invigorating effect upon his bodily health before the end of the long voyage was gained. 
               His helpless limbs gradually strengthened, and when they finally reached the small settlement on the Upper Mississippi, to which they were bound, Louis, with the aid of the captain, was able to ascend the bank himself. But his new protector received him as a body without a soul, for the drug which M. Lecour had ventured to give him in unusual quantities had completely deadened memory, and left the past without a record in his brain. 
               Change of climate, and more active habits of life, slowly developed a new and stronger intelligence than he had possessed since early childhood; but the sealed page was never again unfolded. One little seed dropped by a tender hand in his benighted mind germinated and produced fruit. How or when he had learned the history of Christ, Louis knew not; but it seemed to him, in his new life, that it had intuitively come to him. 
               When after events made him aware that in his veins flowed the royal blood of the Bourbons, he derived from his own recollections of his early youth no confirmation of the truth of the revelation. The lineal King of France became an humble missionary among the Indian tribes, with whom his strange destiny had cast him, and passed a more useful life than if he had been made the puppet of another's ambition. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               THE WRITING ON THE FLOOR. 
               M. LECOUR usually slept very lightly, but by some chance fatal to his schemes, on this evening his slumbers were heavy though not uninterrupted, for Eady saw from the convulsive twitching of his features, when she looked in on him, that he was suffering from pain. Yet she did not venture to arouse him, for she knew that would bring upon herself an explosion of his ire. 
               She silently removed from the table the articles which were strewn on it, to make room for the supper she had been forced to delay to this unusual hour. In doing this she put the letters brought by Pierre where they were not seen by him immediately on awakening, as Adrienne had intended when she placed them there. 
               M. Lecour's sleep was troubled by hideous visions; he saw the phantoms of his victims flit past him, one by one, with extended fingers pointed deridingly toward him, and they seemed to hiss forth: 
               "Traitor-murderer-regicide, go to meet your doom. It is falling!-falling!-falling!" 
               He half awoke with the dreadful sensation of being precipitated downward through an interminable space; yet he could not thoroughly arouse himself. Then two women approached him. One of regal air, and stately bearing, seemed overwhelmed with affliction, as she cried in desolate tones: 
               "Too late! too late!" 
               The other syllabled with distinct utterance: 
               "Your treasure is gone-your hopes are crushed." 
               The first half of the sentence struck a cord in his brain which instantly vibrated to its meaning. The miser's soul was aroused at once, and he awoke with a sharp pain at his heart, and a faint sickness which almost unnerved him, but the vivid consciousness of the words he had heard, remained with him. He muttered: 
               "It is a warning. I will go at once and see." 
               He arose immediately and went toward the lower room, to visit his treasure closet, and ascertain if any one had entered it. He had removed the jewels, but a large sum of money in gold was still there, which he had left to pay the men whom he expected to perform so important a service for him on this night. 
               As M. Lecour unclosed the door, the bloodhound sprang forward, gave a sharp growl, and was ready to spring at his throat, but a word from him sent him back to his lair. The animal in the past four days, had been tamed by hunger, for bread had been supplied to him very sparingly by his master's own hand, till that morning, when M. Lecour had given him a full meal, and ventured to caress him after it, without receiving any indications on the part of the animal of an intention to become unruly toward himself again. 
               He carried a wax taper in his hand, from which he lighted the candles that stood upon the table. As he did so, he thought he saw the flash of the carbuncle which had so mysteriously disappeared a few days before. He had been greatly annoyed at the loss of a gem of such value, and he stooped down and examined the floor with care, hoping that his previous search for it had not been sufficiently thorough to insure success. 
               It was not the carbuncle he had seen, but something so startling-so strange, that a feeling of intense dread was aroused in his soul, to be followed by a paroxysm of fury so overpowering as to threaten his reason. The floor of the room was uneven; one of the planks had sunk toward the centre, and into this, a small pool of blood from the wound of the slaughtered hound had flowed, and remained undisturbed. On the smooth planks around it, a finger had traced with the red fluid the following warning: 
               "Beware! old man! The hour approaches in which right shall conquer injustice." 
               The letters seemed to burn into his brain; to scorch his vision, as he read the warning. He peered at the characters hoping to find them strange to him, but with a shiver he recognized them. Suddenly a new thought darted into his brain. He sprang up, clenched his hands, and furiously exclaimed: 
               "If I believed that, I would immolate her on the spot! Her life! what is it to my welfare? Nothing-nothing. But I will not be too precipitate-I will find some of her writing, and then judge for myself." 
               M. Lecour arose from the crouching position he had assumed the better to examine the writing, and finding his keys, proceeded to open the secret door which led into his treasure closet. This was concealed behind a picture copied from one of David's: Cain meditating the murder of Abel, and it was a fitting companion for the other horrid productions of his own, which hung upon the surrounding walls. 
               The door swung open at his practised touch; behind it was a second one of iron, studded with immense nails, and secured by a strong lock. This, too, yielded without an effort, and he started back with an exclamation at what met his sight from within. For a brief space he stood as one paralyzed; for against a bag of coin was placed a masterly sketch representing the White Terror as she usually appeared to him; it was drawn with a pencil dipped in phosphorus, and in the darkness of the closet it stood forth clear and distinct, a perfect representation of that form so full of dread to him. 
               He threw the door wide open, the light of the candles flashed upon the image, and also upon the ring which he had believed forever lost. M. Lecour snatched it up, and disengaged a slip of paper on which was traced a few lines in the same writing as that upon the floor. 
               "The secret is yours no longer; I have penetrated to your hoarded wealth, but I do not wish to appropriate a tithe of it, though I might justly do so. I give you back this ring, which was once the gauge of a true love that might at last have been happy but for your cruel interference; and with its restoration I warn you that the end approaches. I restore it to avert suspicion from the helpless girl who has ventured in the tiger's den in the vain hope that her innocence and purity might tame the ferocious nature which will not even spare its own when once its ire is aroused. 
               "Be careful how you act toward Adrienne Durand, for the White Terror will fearfully avenge any wrong done to her." 
               With burning eyes and panting breath, M. Lecour read these words, and fear and fury raged alternately in his breast. He shook his clenched hands toward the picture, and in defiant tones shouted: 
               "I care not for you, fiend! spirit of evil! Nemesis! Be what you will, I defy you. By human means this place has been entered, and I believe it has been done through the agency of this girl, who has thrown herself upon my path to accomplish purposes of her own. She is not my child-I feel it-I know it, and I will stop at nothing to put her away from me. Fool that I have been to believe for an instant that one wearing her face could have been of my blood." 
               He seized the picture, trampled it under foot, and utterly defaced it, as he exclaimed: 
               "Out of my sight, shadow of a detested reality! Threaten as you will; fear you as at moments I may be weak enough to do, I still defy you. When my right reason sways me, I am not under your domination. With other phantoms you come in my dreams, but I know you are but an unreal mockery. By human hands were these things placed here, and woe to her who aided in doing so, when I have once convinced myself of her guilt." 
                
               M. Lecour snatched up the defaced picture, held it in the flame of a candle, and with savage triumph beheld it shrivel into a blackened and charred mass. This he threw again beneath his feet, and trampled upon it in the very ecstacy of passion. 
               He then placed the restored ring upon his finger, and examined every part of the room to ascertain if possible by what means the intruder had gained admittance, not only into the room guarded by the formidable dog, but into his very holies of holies-the shrine in which he kept his treasures. 
               He discovered nothing; the locks had not been tampered with. How then could the room have been entered, and by whom? The writing upon the floor, and that on the paper, was a fac simile of that of his deceased wife-and if not written by her spirit, it must have been done by Adrienne herself, for M. Lecour had already remarked that the inexplicable resemblance between Madame Lecour and this young girl, extended even to the character of their writing. 
               Hitherto he had accounted for this in the fact that both had been educated in the same convent, and had probably been instructed in the same style of caligraphy; but now, he discovered in this resemblance food for the new suspicions which had been aroused in his mind. 
               Angry as he was, the deep craft of his nature swayed him even at this moment. He must first seek confirmation of his suspicions, and if found, then- 
               The iron compression of his lips, and the relentless gleam of his eyes, expressed sufficiently what remained unuttered. 
               As he strode across the gallery on his way to the room of the hapless girl, Eady came down the staircase in the hall, carrying a light in her hand. She looked so wild and terrified that M. Lecour paused and confronted her. 
               "What has happened, that you seem scared out of the little wit that nature gave you?" 
                
               She looked around in a bewildered, helpless manner, and faltered: 
               "Wh-a-a-r is de Prince? What's come o' him?" 
               "Who!" thundered her master. "What does the fool mean? What has happened up stairs?" 
               "Oh lor'! oh lor'! nothin' as I knows on-but he aint thar, he's gone clean away." 
               Words are inadequate to convey an idea of the furious rage that darkened and convulsed the features of the listener. He was literally so choked with fury that he had no power to articulate, and the appalled negro would scarcely have been surprised if he had fallen in a fit at her feet. 
               They stood gazing at each other, until M. Lecour recovered breath to ask almost in a whisper, but it was an awfully distinct one: 
               "Where then is that wretched girl? What has become of her?" 
               "She's a lyin' wi' her head on de foot o' his bed sleepin' like a baby, an' I don't b'lieve dat she knows dat he's gone." 
               "Ah well, I shall soon find that out." 
               This was uttered with the same unnatural calmness, and he walked slowly and with effort up the stairs. He felt that his fury had exhausted him, and he must take breath before coming into the presence of the supposed culprit, for he had at once jumped to the conclusion that if Louis was really gone, Adrienne must have betrayed him to the priest, and given him access to the house. 
               Of what had actually happened M. Lecour had a very vague idea, for he could not understand how Louis had been removed, except through the agency of the men commissioned by himself to perform the service, but it was very singular that they should have acted so prematurely, and without his concurrence, for it had been arranged that he was to be present when the prince was taken from the house, and himself and his grand-daughter were to accompany the cortge to the boat. 
               Closely followed by Eady, he entered the apartment lately occupied by Louis, looked around, and saw undisputed evidences of the truth of the negro's statement. His baleful glance fell upon the sleeping girl, whose face was turned upward, and a peaceful smile rested on it. Adrienne was sleeping so soundly that even the horrified exclamations of Eady when she discovered the prince's couch to be empty, had failed to arouse her. 
               M. Lecour lifted a candle, held it above her head, and calmly contemplated it. He muttered: 
               "It is a fair head, but I have seen many a lovelier one fall beneath the knife of the executioner, then why shall I hesitate to punish the double treachery of which this creature has been guilty? Adrienne! awake! Do not feign sleep to conceal your baseness. Where is Prince Louis, and why do I find you pretending to sleep here, when he is not to be found?" 
               At this rude summons, Adrienne started up; her eyes fell on the empty couch, and she asked in a bewildered manner: 
               "Is it time to go, mon pre? Have they taken the prince away already? I must have slept very long." 
               "Louis is gone, and I require you to tell me what has become of him." 
               There was something in the tone of his voice that made her tremble, and she grew pale as death as she faltered: 
               "Gone! impossible! I could not have slept while they removed him, and how is it that we did not accompany him?" 
               "Ah, truly-why are we here when he is not to be found? That, I repeat, is for you to explain, Mademoiselle." 
                
               "I-I?-were not you to superintend his departure. To go with him from the house? Mon pre, this seems like cruel trifling. Oh, what has really happened while my senses were locked in sleep?" 
               "While you feigned sleep, you mean, for that your slumbers were real I do not believe. If you value your own safety, you had better inform me of what has become of my ward. It is not yet time for my agents to arrive, yet Louis has disappeared. Explain this extraordinary condition of affairs, Mademoiselle, for I am putting great force on my passion to keep cool enough to listen to you." 
               "I have none to offer. I am as ignorant of what has taken place as you are." 
               "And do you dare to tell me that he was removed from beside you, and you knew nothing of it? Do you take me for an idiot, that you expect to pass off this shallow imposition upon me. Where is Louis? Answer truly, or take the direst consequences that can befall you." 
               M. Lecour had by this time recovered his voice, and his tones vibrated like thunder in the ears of the frightened girl. Adrienne scarcely comprehended yet the actual position of affairs, but the alarmed face of Eady showed her that she stood in extreme danger from the fury of the enraged man before her. She faintly said: 
               "If the prince has been removed, it must have been done by your own emissaries, for no other person was aware of his presence here. I was overcome with fatigue, and slept soundly. I am not accountable for this contretemps, and I can not explain it." 
               "Then be the consequences on your own head." 
               He rushed furiously toward her, as if to use violence against her, but Eady threw herself before him, and exclaimed: 
               "Not ag'in, marster-not ag'in shall you do murder in my presence. Once afore you did it, an' you knows what follered. De White Terror'll haunt you wuss'n ever, ef you hurt a ha'r of her head." 
               "The White Terror is no longer a dread to me. I defy her." 
               His face was scarcely human, it was so distorted by passion, and Adrienne shrank appalled before it. She attempted to fly, but her trembling limbs refused to obey her will, and she sunk upon her knees and raised her hands imploringly. 
               "Spare me-I am innocent," burst from her pale lips. 
               At that instant the drapery was lifted from the recess in front of the window exactly as on a previous occasion, and the phantom bride stood with upraised arm and threatening hand, as she uttered, in deep, ringing tones: 
               "Beware! Is it not enough to have warned you once, but must I come in person to repeat it?" 
               Thus arrested in his dire purpose, M. Lecour rushed toward the figure, over which the curtain instantly fell; he tore it aside with frantic haste, but the niche was empty; he sounded the walls and struck at the window. When he found that the latter would not yield to his efforts to open it, he dashed the glass into fragments, and thrusting forth his head, looked searchingly around, but the night was too dark to reveal anything, for the moon had not yet risen. 
               Eady whispered to the terrified Adrienne: 
               "Now's your chance, young mistis. Run down sta'rs, an' stay in de Madame's parlor; he won't foller you in thar. I don' know what all dis means, but he sharn't harm you while ole Eady can help it." 
               Thus admonished, Adrienne gathered her sinking energies and fled from the apartment. She scarcely breathed until she found herself locked safely in the lower room of her own turret. 
                
               Subdued and frightened by what had just occurred, in spite of his bold defiance, M. Lecour turned again to the room, hoping to discover some clue to the singular disappearance of Louis. His eyes wandered wildly over the furniture, and they fell at last upon an open paper which had been left on the table by Father Eustace. He took it up and read: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "All stratagems are fair when dealing with a traitor. Know that I came hither armed with both ecclesiastical and political power to guard against the treachery which was to have been consummated to-night. I have known your plans from the beginning, and I have taken such measures as will forever defeat them. 
                           "When this is read by you, Louis XVII. will be beyond your reach, and all your dreams of distinction through his means at an end. 
                           "No treachery has been practised against you by any member of your household. Do not accuse Adrienne Durand of having betrayed you, for when I tempted her to do so, nay, commanded her obedience as a daughter of the church, she refused. Her nature is noble, and she is incapable of returning kindness with ingratitude. 
                           "It is useless to attempt to discover any trace of Louis, for I have taken such precautions as must baffle the keenest search. 
                           
                              FATHER EUSTACE, nee-
                            
                         
                         
                           "No-I reserve that crowning revelation for our next meeting, which must take place to-morrow, and in the interim, if evil has befallen the young girl beneath your roof, severe retribution will be exacted of you." 
                         
                      
                  
                
               M. Lecour ran his eyes over these lines with a feeling of stupefaction. He scarcely comprehended their tenor, and he read them a second time while Eady watched him with a stealthy eagerness, ready to fly at a moment's warning. 
                
               He folded the paper up mechanically, for the greatness of the blow stunned him, and placed it carefully in his pocket. 
               At that instant a wild, prolonged cry, twice repeated, came from the woods in the rear of the house. It was the signal agreed on which was to warn him of the arrival of his confederates. He went slowly down the staircase, followed by the negress carrying a light. 
               In the hall below; M. Lecour took it from her hand, and sternly said: 
               "To your own den, and repent of the words you dared to use to me to-night, for you shall surely rue them bitterly." 
               Glad to escape, Eady hurried away, but she did not go to her cabin. She sped along in the darkness, and sought the room in which Adrienne had taken refuge, to learn from her, if possible, the solution of the extraordinary events of the evening, for she was in a maze of fear and mystery. 
               M. Lecour went toward the private entrance of which such good use had already been made, and on opening it, he found three men standing ready to enter. He spoke at once to the point. 
               "Captain Bottreau, your duties here have already been anticipated. My house has been burglariously entered, and the young man who was to have been taken away by you has been removed without my knowledge. I have but just discovered his absence, and I came hither to warn you of it, and to offer you double the sum you were to have received, if you will pursue and overtake the party, rescue the abducted youth, and take him to your boat. They cannot have entirely escaped yet, and if you will kill the leader of the enterprise, I will give you, in addition to the promised reward, a thousand dollars from my own purse." 
               The men regarded him with silent astonishment. The glare of the candle he held fell upon his face, and they saw that his gray hair seemed to have risen upon his head from the effects of his recent terror; his features wore a heavy leaden pallor, and the convulsive twitchings of his lips and eyelids gave a most sinister expression to his face. His parched lips seemed to unclose with effort, and even in his own ears his voice sounded hollow, as if it echoed from a distant, empty space. 
               "This is very singular," said Captain Bottreau suspiciously, for he was aware of the importance of Louis as a prisoner of state, though he had no idea of his true rank. "How could your ward have been removed without your complicity? I hope there is no new treachery, Monsieur?" 
               "Treachery? was I not to gain everything from holding him in my power?" he asked, with a returning passion. "Know that it was the lawful heir to the French throne who was to have been received upon your boat to-night. Now seek him, find him, and claim any recompense you may think the service worth. Only find him, give him back to me, and you shall be rich-be great." 
               At this declaration the men looked from one to the other, and it was evident they thought the speaker insane, for like the rest of their nation, they believed that Louis had perished from the effects of the ill-treatment he had received during the revolution. Captain Bottreau bluntly responded: 
               "I do not know his rank, nor do I care who he may be; but the reward you offer is a sufficient temptation to serve you. I will pursue the party that carried him off, for I am now almost sure that we passed them on our way here." 
               "Then follow them without loss of time," was the eager response. "Overtake them at all hazards, and be sure to destroy the man who heads the party. Return as soon as you have accomplished your errand, and you will find your reward awaiting you." 
               The men turned away, and struck through the woodland. Suddenly a descent was made upon them by the emissaries of Father Eustace; and surprised by the unexpected nature of the attack, the three were soon overpowered, and securely bound and gagged. 
               Their captors then silently returned, to resume their watch near the chateau. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               THE ACCUSATION. A DIRE PURPOSE FORMED. 
               ADRIENNE threw herself upon a seat, nearly in a state of insensibility. She scarcely yet comprehended what had occurred, or how she had rendered herself liable to the suspicions of M. Lecour. 
               Eady found her trembling and weeping, in a pitiable state of excitement, and the two consulted in guarded tones on the safest means of removing Adrienne without delay from the violence that had already menaced her life. 
               Presently a heavy step was heard overhead, and Eady apprehensively said: 
               "It's his step, an' he's actilly gone into de Madame's room-a place I thought he'd never ha' sot his foot in agin after all that's come an' gone. What can he be lookin' for thar, I wonder?" 
               Before Adrienne could reply, the voice of M. Lecour sounded harshly down the private staircase: 
               "Adrienne, come hither!" 
               She feared to reply, for after the recent scene of violence through which she had passed, she dared not go to him without some pledge on his part that he would do her no injury. 
                
               After a brief pause his voice came more menacingly than before: 
               "Adrienne, I know you are there; come up to me without further delay. I promise you that I will do you no bodily harm; but I must speak with you, that you may comprehend on what terms we must henceforth live together." 
               "Oh! what shall I do?, what must I do?" asked the agitated girl, in a tremulous whisper. 
               Eady reluctantly replied: 
               "I'm 'fraid you mus' go, young mistis. It can't do no harm to hear what he have to say, an' I'll keep watch over you. Besides, after what de White Terror said to him, I b'lieve he'll be afeared to harm you." 
               Adrienne shuddered at this reference to accents which she believed came from another sphere; with a brief prayer for help and protection, she summoned courage to ascend to the upper room. 
               When she entered it, to her intense surprise, she saw M. Lecour seated beside her writing-table, looking over her portfolio. He seemed quite calm now, and in a tone of mock courtesy he looked up and said: 
               "I am only seeking for a specimen of your writing, Mademoiselle. I have a particular use for it; and the letter you did me the honor to address to me from your convent has been mislaid; but I have found here what will answer my purpose quite as well." 
               "And what use do you propose to make of it?" she inquired, with frightened eagerness, for the events of the evening had completely unnerved her. "Of what do you suspect me, Monsieur, that you should treat my private papers in this unceremonious manner?" 
               He deliberately folded down a strip of crumpled paper he had held concealed in his hand, and placed it beside a few lines he had taken from the portfolio. In a tone of ironical courtesy he said: 
               "Come nearer, Mademoiselle-do not fear me; I shall not lift my finger against you again-your protectors seem too powerful to permit me to do that. Look at these two pieces of penmanship, and tell me if they might not both have been written by the same hand?" 
               Adrienne compelled herself to approach him. She glanced upon the two, and said: 
               "They are alike; but the crushed lines are not my writing. I never saw those words before." 
               M. Lecour raised his eyebrows incredulously. His voice was deep and threatening, as he repeated: 
               "You never saw them before? Think again, Mademoiselle. Look at the paper on which it is written. It has the same water-mark-nay, here is the very sheet from which the strip was taken!" and he held up a quire of paper, from the outer leaf of which a piece appeared to have been carelessly torn. Carefully smoothing out the fragment, M. Lecour turned the blank side up, and fitted it to the jagged edges. 
               Adrienne looked on in silent terror; she did not comprehend to what this was to lead, but she felt that something terrible had happened, in which she was implicated in a most mysterious and inexplicable manner. She sank upon a seat through utter inability to remain standing, and faintly said: 
               "I do not know who has used my paper and imitated my writing, but I again declare most solemnly that I am utterly ignorant of the import of what is written on that fragment of paper, although it has evidently been abstracted from my portfolio. Such marvellous things happen in this house, that it is useless to attempt to account for them." 
               M. Lecour again turned the paper, folded it down, and held before her the last two lines, as he hissed, through his set teeth: 
               "Read-read! and then deny your complicity, if you dare utter so barefaced a falsehood!" 
               Adrienne read, mechanically: 
               "Be careful how you act toward Adrienne Durand, for the White Terror will fearfully avenge any wrong done to her." 
               He glared on her with vengeful eyes, as he said: 
               "Now I see through you. You did not see the phantom, but you saw the real form of your accomplice in crime! You have come into my house to play the spy upon me, while you are in league with some one without to rob, perhaps to murder me! To you I owe the disappointment of this night, which wrecks all the hopes of my life! To that accursed Mendon you have betrayed my plans!-through you the residence of Louis has become known!" 
               "Monsieur, I can only repeat that I am innocent. With M. Mendon I have held no communication since I came hither, and the White Terror is as fearful a visitation to me as it is to you." 
               "And you swear that you are not in collusion with those people who have done me this deadly wrong?" 
               "Am I not your child?" she pathetically asked. "Could I then betray your gray hairs to dishonor?" 
               "I do not believe you to be my child," he said, in an excited manner. "Every glance of your eye, every tone of your voice, contradicts the thought. I see now the abhorred resemblance to the curse of my life, yet I must bear with your presence!" 
               "No, no-you need not do so any longer. Let me go-let me leave you forever. I can no longer bear the life I have lived here. Let me go free, and I will trouble you no more. I can win my own bread." 
                
               "No-that is now impossible. You came to me of your own will, and you shall remain until I am ready to get rid of you myself. How or in what way I shall do that remains to be developed by future events." 
               At this threat the heart of the poor girl grew cold within her. She looked upon his lowering brows-his cold, steel-gray eyes, in which no relenting from a purpose once formed was ever found-and despairingly supplicated: 
               "Let me go hence, I pray you. I shall go mad if I am compelled to stay in this house! The phantom bride is fearful enough to contend with, if she were friendly to me; but she seems to have taken the surest means to destroy me while pretending to be my friend. Where did you find that paper? Who can have entered my room, and imitated my writing so accurately? Oh! this is a fearful mystery. But I am powerless to fathom it. Only let me go away, and I will hide myself from you forever." 
               M. Lecour listened unmoved to her passionate entreaties. He coldly said: 
               "You mistake, Mademoiselle. The White Terror sets herself up as your guardian angel. She even threatens me if any evil befalls you. Now a threat is a very tangible mundane thing, and I begin to feel that I have made a fool of myself in believing that an impalpable being can make her presence manifest to mortal vision. I smoke an East Indian drug, known among scientific men as an extract from hemp. In the trance it produces I often see the most extraordinary things. This phantom shape is evoked, like the rest, by my own disordered imagination, mingled with the memory of scenes in which I have acted a part. My servants have never been able to see this creature, even when she was clearly visible to me, which conclusively proves that it is no reality. You yourself denied seeing her when you stood in my doorway on the night after your arrival here. You follow me, I hope, Mademoiselle?" 
                
               She bowed her head in token of assent, and M. Lecour went on: 
               "You force yourself upon my protection-you pry into the secrets of my household, and then profess to have seen the White Terror, that you may use her to further your own designs upon my wealth. In the character of a somnambulist you even penetrate into my private sanctum. You see the spot from which the door opens that conceals the closet in which are kept the money and jewels I have hoarded. Four days afterward I visit this place, and find it has been entered. I find there a picture of the 'goblin damned' that haunts me forever, and close beside it the valuable ring which had so mysteriously disappeared at the time of your first visit. To this ring is attached a strip of paper, which, on examination, proves to have been taken from your portfolio, and inscribed with threatening words to me, apparently written by your hand. Is not this a strong case of circumstantial evidence to be made out against you, Mademoiselle?" 
               "It seems so; but if I were the guilty party, I should scarcely have committed the oversight of using my own paper, and I should certainly have carefully disguised the writing. Since you suspect me of so base a thing as the design to appropriate your money to my own use, I cannot remain beneath your roof. It is my will to go, and I shall certainly do so." 
               He laughed sardonically. 
               "You will not find that so easy to accomplish as you may think. Once mine, forever mine. I live in this secluded house like a hermit, but my sway extends for miles around. I have only to issue my orders to my overseer that you are not to be permitted to pass the boundaries of my plantation, and they will be obeyed. Do you hear the braying of that sleuthhound below? There is a trained pack of them kept at the quarters, and once loosened on your track, how could you hope to escape? If you should make so mad an attempt, and are brought back torn and mangled by their fangs, it will not be my will, but your own perversity, that destroys you." 
               Adrienne shuddered at this terrible picture, and she faintly asked: 
               "Is there no law here for the protection of the helpless, that you can thus coolly speak of my destruction in so awful a manner?" 
               "This is a wild country, Mademoiselle. The government over distant colonies is often merely nominal, and we have been in the habit of doing pretty much as we please. I am rich, I am feared, and there is no one hardy enough to interfere with me, even if an insignificant girl should come to a miserable end through the carelessness of my dog keepers." 
               "Let me return to my convent," pleaded the helpless girl. "I will go anywhere to escape from this dreadful house, and the baleful power which threatens to destroy me." 
               "No-you remain here until you become burdensome to me. Then I will find means to dispose of you as I have done with every other clog upon my path. Ha! you already recoil from the sentimental task you had imposed on yourself. You thought you were to improve me, to soften my nature, to make me human. Ha! ha! Do you remember Burke's celebrated sarcasm against my countrymen, that they are half monkey, half tiger? I claim to be all tiger; I have been a sans culotte; my hands are red with the blood of the high-born, the true-hearted and the brave. There are moments yet in which the old instinct rises within me, and I could kill, kill, kill." 
               He rubbed his hands together with ferocious glee, and Adrienne said, in faltering tones: 
                
               "I see, Monsieur, that I have fallen into the power of a monomaniac. You are better than you seem, but why you should wish to terrify one so dependent upon you as I am, I cannot imagine. If your grounds are so well protected as to forbid all egress on my part, how can you suspect me of holding clandestine intercourse with outside foes who wish to do you harm?" 
               "I did not say that they are yet so, but I shall issue the orders to have them thus guarded. I will withhold my judgment a few days; in the meantime, I shall take good care to convince myself that you are either innocent or guilty." 
               "And if you should be led to fancy that I am the latter, what then?" 
               His heavy brows bent over his flashing eyes, and he slowly said: 
               "Doom! I acknowledge no law. I redress my own grievances, without any resort to such tedious process. I sit in judgment without the aid of a pack of stupid jurymen, whose only business it is to embarrass the chief. In our revolution we dispensed with such assistance, and so do I. 
               "Good night, Mademoiselle; I advise you to keep within your own room to-night, for my new Cerberus is to be relied on better than the last. Hark! he is making sweet music to my ears, for his frantic howls reveal to me that neither man nor demon will, with impunity, enter the room in which he is kept." 
               "Yet you have but just accused me of doing so," she could not forbear saying. 
               He raised his hand in a threatening manner, and said: 
               "Try it again, try it again, and see what will be the result." 
               He strode from the room, leaving the poor girl in a state of agitation and excitement she vainly endeavored to conquer quer. She tried to convince herself that M. Lecour only intended to frighten her, and thus punish her for her supposed participation in the abduction of Louis; he could not be in earnest, and she must soon be cleared from that suspicion, for the parties who had foiled her grandfather's plans would communicate with the old man when they had safely secured their prize. That Father Eustace was the conductor of the enterprise she had not a doubt, and even if the tie between them was an invention of his own, he was bound to rescue her from the dangerous position she felt she now held in that house. 
               Who could have entered her room, used her paper, and imitated her writing, it almost seemed for the purpose of exasperating M. Lecour against her? In a mist of doubt and bewilderment she examined her portfolio to discover some other traces of her visitor. Leaf after leaf was turned over without result, then the pockets were carefully looked into, and in the last one she found a fold of paper on which was written in the same hand: 
               
                  "You have taken almost a fatal step in coming hither, but be careful to do nothing precipitately. When M. Lecour learns your real parentage, and sees the true position you hold with reference to his wealth, he will be unscrupulous in the means he will take to remove you from his path. In the meantime, one who is compelled to work in the dark lives only in the hope of saving you from the consequences of your own rashness, and restoring to you your inheritance. I warn you that there is no crime of which this old recluse is not capable, therefore be on your guard every moment that you pass beneath his roof."
                
               There was no signature, but none was needed, for the writing was identical with that shown her by M. Lecour. After all, then, the object of the White Terror was to serve, and not to destroy her, and she pondered long on the words so mysteriously addressed to her. She felt consoled by the thought that she was not utterly friendless, and a few more hours would probably place her beyond the power of the fearful old man. 
               As M. Lecour passed out of Adrienne's room, he detected Eady lingering on the gallery, and he sternly ordered her to bring up his late supper without further delay. 
               In obedience to this command, it was soon placed before him, but when he attempted to drink the strong coffee the trembling negro prepared for him, he experienced a strange repulsion toward it, and his throat seemed to close against the admittance of the liquid. 
               The sensation of sinking which had been so dreadful in his dream last night, came back to him even as he sat there in his heavy chair: it seemed to him as if the earth was slipping away from beneath his feet-as if chaos was gathering around him, and from its dreary depths, came a small still voice which said: 
               "The hour has come; you belong to this world no longer." 
               Cold shivers ran through his blood, accompanied at intervals by agonizing pains which seemed to start from the cauterized wound upon his hand, and rapidly permeate every nerve in his system, inflicting a subtle torture which almost forced him to cry out. 
               "My drug will alleviate this for a season," he thought, and he took from his pocket a box filled with a resinous substance of a pale green color. He took a large dose, and in a few moments fancied that he was decidedly better. He suddenly remembered his letters, and turning to Eady, who was still in the room, he asked: 
               "Has that miserable Pierre returned from the office with my letters yet?" 
                
               "Oh yes, monsher," (when Eady attempted to give this title to her master, it sounded exceedingly like monster,) "he's done gone to bed a long time ago." 
               "Where then are the letters, and why have they not been given to me before this time?" 
               "Caze you's been too busy to look at 'em. I found 'em on de table when I came in de fust time to-night, an' here dey is now, whar I put 'em myself." 
               As she spoke, Eady placed the two letters before him. He motioned her to leave the room, and she was glad to be able to return to Adrienne, with whom she remained until her nervous alarm was in a measure allayed, and the negress retired to her own cabin, taking the key of her room with her as usual. 
               Left alone M. Lecour took up his letters, and looked at the address on them in a vague kind of way. The writing of both was entirely new to him, and he wondered who could have written them, yet he felt no interest in ascertaining their contents. 
               For the last hour he had felt within himself the consciousness that death was in his veins. Death in its most terrible form. He might possibly allay the pangs he was doomed to suffer by the use of the hatchis, but his system was too inured to that to permit him to hope that it would act as a counter-poison to the virus which had evidently infected every drop of blood in his body. 
               What did it matter now to him whether Louis was removed from his care, or what became of him? His honors, his lately won nobility, all his wealth a hundred times told, could not rescue him from one pang-could not save him from that awful reckoning whose crimes glared on him from the ensanguined records of the past. 
               He writhed in his seat, as face after face, conjured up by his excited imagination, arose before him, approached close to his own, and jeered at him with exulting laughter, now his own hour had come. With cruel hands, he had helped to thrust them out of life, and now they avenged themselves in their turn. Among his tormentors he recognized him who had once been his king, reproaching him with the sacrilege of which he had been guilty, in laying violent hands on God's annointed. A pale shadow flitted by his side, who looked sternly and reproachfully upon him, as she muttered: 
               "False to your promise; where is my son? Why is he not restored to his birthright?" 
               Half an hour of such torture passed, and then his iron system reacted. He regained his usual callous calmness, and remembered that he must look out for the return of Captain Bottreau. He arose, and went steadily toward the door at which he had received him. He unclosed it cautiously, and eagerly listened for indications of his return. 
               Everything around was breathlessly still, and little did he dream that those he was looking for were securely tied, within two hundred yards of the spot on which he stood; that hostile eyes watched his motions from a neighboring thicket, as he thrust forth his head and peered around. 
               A sudden whirring noise in his ears, and a sensation of faintness warned M. Lecour that he had better return to his own apartment. He slowly and heavily mounted to it, and as he entered, the letters, still unopened, met his sight. 
               For a season he bad quite forgotten them, but now he sat down, broke the seal of one and commenced its perusal. Instantly his whole bearing changed-his form became erect, his eyes flashed, and blood flowed back to his cadaverous face. 
               It was the one written by Pauline Crozat, and he read it to the end without pausing. His hand dropped beside him still grasping the paper, and he muttered: 
               "I might have known as much before this revelation came, if I had not been blindly besotted. Ah well! it is not yet too late. She is in my power and I can thrust her down-thrust her down in spite of the threats of the priest. What do they signify to me when I know that I am a doomed man? Let this dainty creature share my doom, it is good enough for her. 
               "Yet the girl came to me with good intentions, and why should I reward her thus? Why not perform one good deed to balance the many evil ones I have committed? 
               "Yet she may give her hand to Adolphe Mendon. I hate him, hate him, and he shall never claim a penny of this fortune which he has so eagerly coveted. Ah-a! there is that deadly-deadly pang again!" 
               He bent his head down, clenched his hands, and firmly closed his lips while the spasm lasted. Again his thoughts wandered vaguely to the past, and once he spoke to his former friend Danton. 
               "Why falter in your policy now. Let them go-Vergniaud, Brissot, Roland, all-all, so we are saved. Robespierre is the man; he will prove the national saviour. Empty the prisons! The cursed aristocrats cumber them too much. Get rid of them!-make room for others. Hurrah! Ah, here they come!-here they come, my phantom troop. Merrily will we take our last dance to-night." 
               With great effort he started up, but sunk down almost immediately, panting and breathless. 
               After another interval of quiet, M. Lecour again regained perfect consciousness, and the second letter was at last taken up, and the seal broken. It was written in a firm manly hand, and contained these words: 
                
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "M. LECOUR-I write this to announce to you that I shall call on you the day after this reaches your hand, to transact some very delicate business with reference to the succession of M. Montreuil, the father of your late wife. 
                           "By a deed now in my possession, the estates of that gentleman were settled irrevocably on the descendants of his daughter, if she left any, and in default of such heirs, the property reverts to his family in France. 
                           "Louise Montreuil became the mother of a child who yet lives; this daughter was the offspring of her first marriage with Henri Durand. The proofs of the authenticity of that marriage, are also in my possession; and they establish beyond doubt the right of this young lady to succeed to her grandfather's estate. 
                           "If you are disposed to act justly in this matter, you will be liberally dealt with, and I trust that rival claims can be settled without recourse to the courts. I considered it best to forewarn you of my intended visit, and its object, that you may be prepared to meet my demands in a proper spirit. 
                           
                              Respectfully, 
                              VICTOR DU VERNAY."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               All the evil passions in the bad nature of M. Lecour were aroused by the perusal of this letter. What! had the lover of Adrienne actually arrived in Louisiana, and possessed himself of the power to thrust him aside, and take possession of the very roof that sheltered him? Should he submit to be thus despoiled? Never! never!
                
               Hush! What was that which clutched at his heart, and seemed crushing the life out of it? Was he not fast hastening to that last narrow house, in which the loftiest aspirations, the most grasping desires, must finally be laid at rest? Why then should he refuse to surrender this earthly home to its lawful claimant? 
               At moments, Adrienne had touched a tender cord in his nature; the last remnant of the divinity implanted in him at his birth, which he had done so much to outrage and deface. Why not suffer it to vibrate once more, and give her life, fortune and freedom to enjoy them? 
               Then the memory of her parents came back to him, and he clenched his hands, and hardened his heart anew. No-the child of Henri Durand, and of her who even persecuted him beyond the grave, should never go forth scatheless from his power. Through him the parents had perished-through him should the daughter share the same fate. 
               Yet how should he deal with her? How evade the punishment Father Eustace had denounced against him if any evil befell Adrienne? and he knew the man he had to deal with, too well to doubt that he would redeem his pledge. 
               What if he could make her walk into danger herself? She had already ventured almost in the jaws of his bloodhound, why should she not be left to do so again? 
               The diabolical thought made him shudder, but it came back again and again. 
               It would be easy to get rid of her thus, and no one could bring home to him the charge of murder. 
               Besides, did she not merit this doom at his hands? Had she not entered his house under false pretences? Must she not have been aware of the nature of her own claims? and she had evidently come hither, to strengthen the probabilities of succeeding in her nefarious plan to possess herself of his wealth, by winding herself into his affections through her gentle womanly wiles. 
               Ha! he had baffled her there; his hard nature had refused to soften at her touch, and she should see of what it was yet capable. 
               Was he not perishing by slow tortures from the wound gained on her account? But for her intrusion on that night, his dog would never have sprung upon him and given him his death wound. Let her share his fate. It would be good enough for her. 
               The firmly set lips, cold gleaming eyes, and cruel expression revealed that his mind was made up. The question now was, how should he give her freedom to come forth? for at his own command, the door had been locked every night since her visit to the picture room, and the key left in Eady's care. 
               He must get it without delay. He looked at his watch, it was now one o'clock, and before the dawn of another day, this last act of his fiend-like career must be consummated. 
               He felt almost well again, and he arose, took a candle in each hand, and went below. He glanced fearfully around, lest the White Terror should meet him on his way like an avenging Nemesis, and give him over at once to the companionship of the evil spirits he believed at her command. 
               Nothing arrested his dreadful purpose, and when he gained the entrance next to Eady's cabin, he placed the light on a table, noiselessly unclosed the door, and stepped out. 
               The moon had risen above the tree tops, and poured down a steady flood of light upon the open space. M. Lecour lightly crossed the garden, tried the latch of the cabin door, and found, as he expected, that it was not secured from within. 
               The door was cautiously opened, and he paused on the threshold to listen to the regular breathing of those who slept within. He knew how difficult it was to awake either of them, and he fearlessly stepped into the room, and peered around. As his eyes gradually became accustomed to the dim light, he could see objects distinctly enough for his purpose. He began to fear he should at last be baffled, when he discovered the object of his search lying on a shelf near the door. Grasping it with feverish eagerness, M. Lecour retreated as silently as he had come. With a hard feeling of triumph, he crossed the yard, took up his candles, and retraced his steps. When he reached the picture room, he cautiously unlocked the door and looked in; the fierce dog, arroused by the sudden flash of light, started forward, growling and showing his teeth. His master uttered a few soothing words, and the hound crept back to his lair. 
               Leaving the door slightly ajar, the wretched old man crept upstairs, placed the key in the lock of Adrienne's door, and softly turned it. 
               He listened eagerly, but no sound came from within, and he ventured to open a small crevice that he might reconnoitre. The candle was still burning on her table, and Adrienne, dressed as she had been during the day, sat in a large chair in front of the dying fire, wrapped in sleep. She held an open letter grasped in her hand, and seemed at last to have succumbed to weariness, in spite of her dread of him. He saw that her eyelids were swollen with weeping, and her lips had a tremulous expression of suffering upon them, that would have moved a softer nature; but he who looked on her with vengeful eyes, and hatred in his evil heart, had no such relenting. M. Lecour placed himself on the watch; he was afraid of the cold night air, so he retreated into his own room, opened the door half way, and placed his chair in such a position that he could see her if she came out. 
               Ten, twenty, thirty minutes; an hour passed away with no result; and in his heart he began to curse her because she did not come forth to her own destruction. Must he stab her as she slept, and bear the consequences due to the crime? 
               Ah! they could not touch him now, for was he not already far on the road to the same grave into which he was resolute to thrust her? Why should he fear punishment ment, when it could never reach him? Man could no longer bring him to an account. His Maker alone could now sit in judgment upon him, and this last crime could add but little to the fearful catalogue already arrayed against him. 
               M. Lecour opened a drawer, and took from it a keenly-pointed dagger; he removed the scabbard, tried the edge with his finger, and flashed it in the light. He muttered: 
               "Courage! courage! One blow to her, one to myself, and all is ended. This miserable suffering will then be evaded; I shall die as becomes a man, and not in throes of agony, caused by a scratch received from a wretched animal. Ah, little beauty! you have done me good service before to-day. Henri Durand, if disenthralled spirits can return to this nether world, come back now, and protect your child. Louise, if your haunting shadow can intervene to hold back the blow, now is the time to extend your sheltering arms, for I am as relentless as Brutus, and stern as Fate itself." 
               He arose, with his evil heart steeled to the fell purpose that animated it, but paused an instant as he saw the door of Adrienne's room beginning to open. Slowly and timidly it unclosed, and with cautious steps she came forth, holding her hands stretched out in front of her, as if feeling her way. 
               For an instant she turned toward his room, and he saw that her face was pale and fixed, her eyes open, and looking steadily in front of her, though apparently seeing nothing. After hesitating a few seconds, she slowly turned to the head of the staircase, and commenced descending it; she reached its foot, and with lingering steps approached the picture room. 
               M. Lecour rapidly gained the head of the stairs; he might yet stop her, and there was a momentary relenting in his heart, as he saw her thus walking to what he believed must be certain destruction. The feeling was stifled as Adrienne turned her head and looked back upon him. The light he held in his hand fell upon her face, and its strong resemblance to one that had haunted and made him miserable again steeled his heart, and he stood in breathless excitement awaiting the dire catastrophe that he was certain must follow her entrance into the den of the ferocious bloodhound. 
               Adrienne laid her hand on the lock, the door yielded to her touch, it opened, she glided in, and it was blown to behind her by a sudden puff of wind. There was a savage howl, a cry as of one in mortal agony, and M. Lecour rushed back to his own room with his fingers thrust in his ears. 
               He gained it, and stood for one instant with starting eyes, foaming lips, and writhing body, then he fell helplessly forward in a violent spasm. 
               His own fate was upon him, and the tortures of the Inferno could scarcely rival those he was doomed to bear in the flesh before soul and body were finally disunited. But what mattered that? Had he not acted out his malignant nature to the last, and disconcerted the hopes of those who had evidently built plans of future happiness on the possession of his wealth? 
               When he recovered consciousness, all was still below, but he did not have many moments allowed him to exult in his base stratagem. Again those awful convulsions attacked him, and racked his frame with such anguish as would have made him glad to be released even by violence. 
               Once he made an effort to grasp his dagger, that he might plunge it into his heart and end his misery; but his hand had lost its cunning, and the weapon fell from his nerveless grasp. 
               Hours, that seemed an eternity, passed before day dawned, and he lay grovelling through their wearisome length, unable to help himself or summon assistance. When the first blessed gleam of the morning light struggled into his chamber, he thought with despair of the time that must yet elapse before Eady would come up to attend to her morning duties-for he was never an early riser, and in the present crisis of affairs he knew the poor negro would not venture to disturb him at an unusual hour. 
               How could he endure this agony till help came? He would cry out and alarm the house; he made the attempt, but his hoarse and feeble voice refused to obey his will, and the harsh sounds he uttered sent a thrill of horror to his soul, as the strange idea came to him that they sounded like the barking of a dog. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               GONE! WHAT CAN HAVE BECOME OF HER? 
               M. MENDON and the priest reached Corona just as day was dawning. The former wished to take the road back to Bellair in preference to returning home, but Father Eustace insisted that they needed a few hours' rest to recruit their energies for the duties of the coming day. 
               Anxious as M. Mendon was for the safety of Adrienne, he was compelled to admit the cogency of this reasoning, for he began greatly to feel the need of repose himself. He therefore submitted to return to Corona with the understanding that they were not to remain there later than seven o'clock. By nine they could then be with M. Lecour, and that was probably as early an hour as they could hope to be received by him. 
               Ignorant as both were of the information conveyed through Pauline to the old man, the priest thought Adrienne as secure from actual danger beneath the roof of Bellair as under his own protection, so he slept in a few moments calmly and refreshingly. 
               It was not thus with M. Mendon. He tossed restlessly from side to side, and when he finally closed his eyes in sleep, the most terrific visions flitted before him. He saw Adrienne dying beneath the blows of the infuriated old man; then Louise appeared to him, and reproached him bitterly that he could not become the defender of her child without an interested motive. He beheld the two floating away toward Heaven, clasped in each other's arms, and vainly entreated them to return to earth again, that he might make a late atonement for his selfishness. 
               He awoke from such miserable fantasy unrefreshed, and more anxious than before. After a rapid toilette, he came from his room to hurry the early breakfast he had ordered for himself and Father Eustace, and to see himself that fresh horses were saddled for their use. 
               Early as it was, he found Madame Crozat awaiting him in the dining-room, with an expression of anxiety and vexation upon her features. She did not know what had taken him away on the previous night, but from some unguarded expressions that had fallen from his lips, she believed that Adrienne was in some way connected with the success of the expedition, and she was anxious to learn what had really occurred. 
               The solemnity of his oath to the priest bound M. Mendon to secresy with respect to the prince, and he was embarrassed by the direct inquiry made by Madame Crozat as soon as they met. 
               "Whither did you go last night and the night before, Adolphe? Has Father Eustace stolen your confidence from me, besides appropriating to his service the hours that you should devote to rest? Hitherto I have been your adviser, and I do not think you have ever lost anything by following my counsels." 
               "Nothing can be truer than that, Madame mre, but in this I had no power to consult you. It is business in which Father Eustace alone is concerned, and I am bound to keep his confidence inviolate. On those terms he agreed to aid me to accomplish the hopes that are dearest to my heart." 
               "Him-are you sure that he has the power to do so?" 
               M. Mendon drew near to her, and spoke in cautious tones. 
               "I will tell you now, dear Madame, what must soon become known to you at any rate. Strange and incredible as it seems, Father Eustace is the son-in-law of M. Lecour. He has confided to me that he is the Julien Durand who eloped with his daughter, and after her death, in disgust with the world, he resolved to devote himself to the service of the church." 
               "And he is actually the father of the young girl who came up the river with us?" was the breathless inquiry of Madame Crozat. "It is incredible!" 
               "Yes-so it seems to me; yet I do not doubt that he is really Julien Durand." 
               "Then of course he must be her father, if she is really the grand-daughter of M. Lecour." 
               "If, certainly, but on that doubt hangs the whole mystery. I feel in my own mind the assurance that Adrienne is what we first supposed her to be: the child of Louise Montreuil. I have a right to believe this, for I have had a supernatural assurance of it given to me in the most extraordinary manner." 
               Madame Crozat looked incredulous. 
               "Do not permit your natural good sense to be clouded by superstitious fancies, my son. Tell me how such an impression came to be made upon you." 
                
               M. Mendon hesitated a moment, uncertain how to account for his presence at Bellair without betraying the motive which had taken him thither. At length he said: 
               "I was seized with a strong desire to visit the old chateau night before last, and I availed myself of the knowledge of a private entrance constructed long ago by the orders of my brother, to get in and explore the house. I had the vague hope that I might see Mademoiselle Adrienne in her nocturnal wanderings, for you remember that she betrayed upon the boat that she is a somnambulist." 
               "And were you rewarded for your night ride, by a glimpse of her?" 
               "I was-I saw her cross the corridor that runs through the house, but I did not dare to betray my presence. I watched her till she ascended the staircase, and entered her own room." 
               "Well-and the ghost? Where did you meet that?" 
               "As I passed through the long dark hall on my way toward the entrance, my mind was so deeply absorbed, that I unconsciously uttered aloud the query we have been so anxious to solve. You will scarcely believe me, although I assert in the most solemn manner that I was answered, and in such a way as to confirm my belief in Adrienne's descent from the Montreuil family. Nay-more than that, I saw the white phantom flit before me across a faint line of moonlight that fell through a crevice in one of the shutters." 
               "And you really believe that you have seen the spirit of Louise Mendon?" was the incredulous inquiry that followed. 
               "What else could it be? It was her voice that spoke in my ear, so close that it seemed as if I could almost feel her breath upon my cheek." 
               "And the form? did it resemble her's?" 
               "The light was too faint to determine; besides, it seemed to be wrapped in flowing folds of white drapery." 
                
               "Of course the legendary costume of the impalpable sisterhood would be assumed. If the voice of Louise Montreuil spoke in your ear, she is living, as I have long suspected." 
               M. Mendon regarded her with amazement. 
               "Louise living, and I not know it! Impossible! She would never have concealed her existence from me. What are your grounds for such a belief, Madame mre?" 
               "Only trifles that have come to my knowledge, which I have dovetailed together from a theory of my own. One thing is certain, that if she is yet on earth, Dr. Brunel knows all about it, for he rescued her from the river when she plunged into it in a fit of despair. It was whispered then that she had been resuscitated by his efforts, but resolute not to return to her tyrannical husband, she induced the doctor to aid her to deceive him by giving her a potion which would enable her to assume the appearance of death. You were away during those years, and on your return, she may not have thought it safe to confide in you. Mind, I do not assert that Louise Mendon is living, but I certainly believe that if she spoke to you in her natural tones on that night, she did so in the flesh, and not as an impalpable spirit." 
               "And if she lives, the estate will belong to her, and not to Adrienne," said M. Mendon, in a tone of chagrin which betrayed how much more he regarded the property than either his sister-in-law or her daughter. 
               Madame Crozat looked at him with a hard smile. She coldly said: 
               "If money is the great incentive to this match, perhaps it will be well to keep a hold on my step-daughter till you are certain of the quarry at which you aim. Do not risk a certainty for an uncertainty, for Pauline had letters from France last night, informing her of the successful issue of her suit, and in place of gaining two hundred and fifty thousand francs, she will be mistress of nearly half a million." 
               M. Mendon listened with evident eagerness. 
               "Pauline is handsome, and at times engaging, but she will be inclined to exact a slave's service for the enjoyment of her wealth; the young and ductile Adrienne could be moulded to my will." 
               "Perhaps so, if she were very much attached to you, which she evidently is not, or she would have accepted my protection when it was offered to her with the distinct intimation that she could win you for her husband by so doing. Adrienne has a spirit of her own, and she will never be ruled by a man to whom policy induced her to give her hand. Am I right in the supposition that for the mysterious service you have performed for Father Eustace, his reputed daughter is to be the reward?" 
               "With your usual acuteness you have fathomed the truth, Madame. Once mine, I shall, as you lately assured me, know how to win the affections of my bride, however reluctantly she may accept me." 
               "I trust it may prove so, but still keep fair with Pauline till your success is beyond question. Something tells me that she is the surest card for you to play." 
               "And something equally reliable assures me that Adrienne is now within my grasp, and I will not easily relinquish my hold upon her fate. I have no time to parley longer, Madame mre, for Father Eustace is crossing the gallery, and our breakfast is waiting for us. By the time we drink our coffee, the horses will be awaiting us, and we have no time to lose. Hey for Bellair and my promised bride! I shall surely return here accompanied by Mademoiselle Durand, and I request that for her use the best chamber in the house shall be prepared." 
                
               "Have matters progressed thus far, indeed? Of course the room shall be in readiness, and my welcome most cordial, but I am really afraid that it will be necessary to guard against my step-daughter's violence. How do you propose to get her away from M. Lecour?" 
               "Father Eustace, alias Julien Durand, will claim her as his daughter, and take her under his own protection that he may transfer her to your care. You see the path is clear before me now, but I trust your theory about Louise will prove untrue. She can only live to misery, and it will be far better for all parties concerned that she should be quietly sleeping in her grave." 
               Madame Crozat smiled faintly, for the thought came to her that perhaps he would feel the same toward her when her possessions passed by death into his hands; but she had no time to reply before the priest joined them. 
               She gravely presided at their hurried breakfast, and silently waited for some intimation from Father Eustace of the new inmate he expected to introduce into her family that day. Just as they were leaving he contented himself with saying: 
               "I shall be compelled to claim your hospitality for a young friend of mine for a few days, Madame; I trust she will find a welcome?" 
               "The best I can give, father, is at the disposal of any friend brought hither by you," was the bland response, though in her heart Madame Crozat was jealous of the influence the priest seemed suddenly to have acquired over her step-son. With her talent for managing, she could not endure the idea that another should have arranged this match for her darling Adolphe. She could not bear that he should owe his happiness to any one beside herself. Besides, her shrewd sense taught her to doubt the priest, and she believed he was playing a double game in which other interests ests than Adolphe's would in the end be alone considered. She thought if Adrienne were really the heiress, in place of bestowing her hand in marriage on his tool, he would compel her to re-enter her convent that her wealth might be absorbed in its coffers. 
               However, the apartment should be prepared for her reception, let the result be what it might, and no sooner had the two horsemen disappeared through the gate than she issued her orders to that effect. 
               Pauline came from her room in time to hear the directions given. She asked with a sneer: 
               "Who is the room to be used by, Madame mre? Is the young stranger at Castle Dismal expected to become its occupant?" 
               "I believe she is," replied Madame Crozat, drily. 
               A laugh of exultation came from Pauline's lips, and she said: 
               "I will lay you a wager, Madame, that she does not come hither to-day, or any other day." 
               "What can you mean, Pauline?" 
               "Just what I have said, I have warned M. Lecour of the project on foot to unite the fortunes of the daughter of Louise Montreuil with the poverty of your stepson, and if he is not quite mad, he will remove her beyond the reach of those who have speculated on her chances of stripping him of his wealth. There Madame, I think I have redeemed my pledge, and used the information I gained for my own purposes, as I warned you I would." 
               "And how have you obtained such information as this?" sternly asked the elder lady. 
               "Partly from my own wit, but chiefly from the revelations of Lonie. Did you think me so shallow as to repeat to you what she really said? No-I reserved that for the person most deeply concerned in learning it, M. Lecour himself." 
                
               "And have you actually endangered the existence of this poor child, by revealing to that old tiger what may induce him to take her life? Pauline, I cannot believe that even you would do such a thing as that." 
               Pauline became slightly paler, but she vindictively said: 
               "I have done so, and neither do I believe that such fatal results will ensue. You only wish to frighten me, Madame." 
               Madame Crozat regarded her with an expression of extreme repulsion. She firmly said: 
               "You may be assured of one thing, Mademoiselle. If any evil has happened to Adrienne Durand through your culpable interference, all hope of a union between you and Adolphe is forever ended. He shall never marry you; that is my ultimatum, and he will not act in opposition to my will." 
               "Very well, Madame, I am contented that it shall be so. With my half million of francs, I can soon find as good a husband as Adolphe would make," was the defiant reply. "I am going to France on the next ship that leaves New Orleans, to take possession of my fortune, and do not think I shall ever trouble Louisiana with my presence again." 
               Madame Crozat scarcely paused to hear her concluding words. Her mind was rapidly acting on what she had just heard, and she hurried from the room, ordered the swiftest horse in the stable to be saddled, and by the time it was brought to the door with a half grown negro mounted on him, she had ready a note, in which she had written: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "M. LECOUR has been warned of Adrienne's real position. Lose not a moment in reaching Bellair, for she has already been too long left to the mercy of that hard-hearted old monster. I cannot explain now, but you may rely on the accuracy of my information. 
                           
                              "LUCILLE CROZAT."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
                
               The boy was ordered to gallop at the top of his speed on the road toward Bellair, till he overtook the two gentlemen who had so lately left. He did not accomplish this till after five miles had been passed over, for the two equestrians had not loitered by the way themselves. They had checked their horses to allow them a breathing spell, and thus the messenger was enabled to come up with them. 
               M. Mendon betrayed much excitement when he read the lines traced upon the paper, and he handed them to his companion with the brief remark: 
               "My premonitions did not deceive me. For mercy's sake, let us not lose a moment now." 
               Father Eustace, also, seemed more deeply moved than usual. His lips trembled, and his voice grew husky, as he said: 
               "Let us on, in God's name! and if any evil has happened to her, a double reckoning will be demanded at his hands. Yet, M. Lecour will never have dared to use violence, after the warning I left for him. No-no! All will be well-all must be well;" but the very repetition of the assurance proved that he doubted his own words. 
               The horses were again put at full speed, and the remaining distance rapidly passed over. The sun had risen above the crowding tree tops when they gained the neglected woodland that surrounded the chateau. The broken gateway afforded them free ingress, and the two rode without slacking their speed to the steps leading to the front door. 
               The house lay still and silent in the morning sunshine, and no sound from its silent desolation indicated that human life was stirring within. A loud summons upon the knocker did not again bring the head of the irritable master out of the window to demand their errand, as M. Mendon half expected, and they looked and listened in vain for an answer. 
                
               They thought they heard once a feeble cry, but it was not repeated, and again he seized the ponderous lion's head, and struck a peal upon the door that reverberated like thunder through the house. 
               This brought Eady to the door, and she inquired in trembling tones: 
               "Who's out dar a knockin'?" 
               "It is I, Eady! Open to me speedily, or I shall be tempted to break down your door!" responded M. Mendon. 
               "Oh! Marse Adolphe, you's jes' come in de time you was mos' wanted, for my ole man aint got no sense lef'; he's so scared of de marster, an' I aint much better myself." 
               While she thus maundered on, Eady unlocked the door, and revealed her own face, with that pale, dusky shading upon it, which in the black always betrays the extremity of terror. 
               "What has happened, Eady? Nothing, I trust, that can injure Mademoiselle Durand?" 
               "Oh Lor'! I don' know-I don' know; but she aint in her room, an' I couldn't find her, I 'spect, ef I had de time to look arter her, de marster's took so bad, he keeps me tendin' on him every minute." 
               "Take us up to M. Lecour at once," said the priest, with authority. "I must see for myself what is the matter with him, and find out very speedily what he has done with the young lady." 
               "He aint in no state to reject to any one comin' up now," said Eady, in a disconsolate tone. "I reckin you may as well foller me up stairs to onct." 
               With this permission, the two visitors mounted to the tower, and unceremoniously entered it, closely followed by Eady. Pierre was there, looking helpless and bewildered; and to the eager, passionate queries of the strangers, no satisfaction was obtained beyond the fact that the key to Adrienne's enne's room had been extracted from the cabin during the night; this morning it was found in the lock of her door, but no traces of her could be discovered. 
               On coming into M. Lecour's room, only a few moments before the arrival of M. Mendon and the priest, Eady had discovered her master lying upon the floor in a half senseless condition. Further than this, the negroes could reveal nothing. 
               M. Lecour had been lifted from the floor, and placed upon his couch, and some attempts had been made by the old woman to straighten his long grey hair, and place his dressing robe in decorous folds around him; but he tossed from side to side every instant, and his livid, foaming lips, and convulsed features, showed that he was suffering intensely. The visitors drew near him, looked down on the revolting spectacle he presented, and Father Eustace sternly said: 
               "Where is the young lady who was left sleeping last night, when we removed your prisoner from this house? Did not my warning suffice to show you how dangerous to you it would be to attempt any wrong toward her?" 
               It was evident that M. Lecour retained perfect consciousness; he lifted his hand defiantly, and hoarsely muttered: 
               "If I have been baffled by your cunning, you shall be so in your turn. Seek the girl till you find her, and see then how much I regarded your threats." 
               Fierce and bitter hatred gleamed in the eyes of the two who steadily regarded each other. The priest spoke in low and measured accents, but every tone was full of defiance. 
               "Etienne Lecour, there is one crime already registered against you which I have sworn to avenge: if this be added to it, fearful will be your doom." 
               "Strike now-I am helpless-I cannot defend myself, and it will be a release from the torments I suffer, to go even to Hades. Strike, I say, I would bare my own breast to the blow, if I had the power to do so." 
               The eye of the priest fell on the scarred hand from which the bandages had been torn in his violent struggles, and he asked, with a shudder: 
               "What does that mean? How did you receive that wound?" 
               "It means death-death in its most ghastly shape. How did I receive it, ha? In the defence of an ingrate, and yet you come to me to exact retribution for the fate she richly merited. Go-find the dread truth for yourself, I shall not reveal it; and you, Adolphe Mendon, are baffled in the hope that brought you hither. The heiress of Bellair is now with her mother in a realm widely severed from this." 
               "Dead!" exclaimed Father Eustace, becoming very pale. "Old man, you have not dared to commit this last crowning horror of your most detestable life?" 
               "I dare anything. Look-look, learn what I have done, and then release me from this torment." 
               "Wretch! do you know what you have done? Was it not enough for you to imbue your hands in the blood of my only brother? but must this child also meet her doom at your hands? Know that I am Julien Durand, once the husband of your unhappy daughter. Miserable man! have you brought your crimes to a climax by taking a life you were bound to protect by every law of humanity and justice?" 
               M. Lecour half arose, and regarded the speaker with a ghastly expression of mingled fear and defiance. 
               "Don't, don't say that she was mine; no, no, she was the child of Henri and Louise, not yours-not yours. Julien Durand, I hate and defy you now as deeply as when I thrust my daughter from me because she wedded you." 
               "And you will give me no clue to what has become of Adrienne?" 
                
               "Never! seek her, as I before bade you, and learn the vengeance of which I am capable. She would have palmed herself upon me as mine, but I know now that she was not. You may be Julien Durand, the husband of Estelle, but the ingrate I have disposed of as she deserves, is certainly no child of hers or yours. She bears her mother too plainly in her face, to admit a doubt of her origin." 
               "Where shall I seek her? woe-woe to you, if you have injured a hair of her head." 
               "Ha! if you were the fiend himself, you could hardly inflict greater torments than I have endured within the last six hours, so I care nothing for your threats. You can but take my life, and that will be a mercy." 
               The voice of M. Lecour sounded husky and hollow, but it was quite distinct, and the two visitors looked at each other in appalled silence. It was evident that nothing could be gained from him, and M. Mendon said: 
               "Let us obey him, and search the house. Adrienne must be found somewhere in it." 
               "Aye, she will be found in it," repeated M. Lecour, with mocking emphasis, but the words died away in a gurgle in his throat, his form writhed, and his features became fearfully distorted with the spasms that again attacked him. 
               The priest recognized the symptoms, and he said, in accents of horror: 
               "He is suffering from hydrophobia, and the wound upon his hand is explained. Do not stand near enough to him to be injured, for his malice is deep enough to impel him to make an effort to impart a deadly virus to you. Let us proceed upon our search." 
               Pierre remained to witness the tortures he had no power to alleviate, and Eady, with a broken and dismayed expression, led the way into the opposite tower. Adrienne's portfolio folio lay open on the table, and the letter which had so mysteriously been placed within it, was lying upon the leaves. The candle had burned down to the socket, but there was no evidence that the young girl had been in her bed the previous night. 
               Her shawl and hood lay in a chair, and if, as they now hoped, she had wandered away in a state of somnambulism, she had evidently gone without their protection from the cold night air. 
               Eady mournfully said: 
               "De young man what lived upstairs were stole away las' night, an' she mus' ha' follered him away, I reckin. But how de key got in her door is de mist'ry to me. I am feered he got it an' put it thar hisself." 
               "But with what object?" asked Father Eustace. "Surely, he would not have betrayed her to destruction. I cannot think it, even of him. She must be found somewhere in the house." 
               "Yes, she must be found," echoed M. Mendon, but he began to have fearful thoughts of the doings of the past night. He sternly asked: 
               "Where were you, Eady, that you did not awake and come to her assistance? I fear, I fear she needed it most sadly." 
               "I don' sposen dat she called out at all, tho' ef she had, I sleeps so infunnelly sound, dat I moughtn't a, heard her." 
               Eady opened the door of the private staircase and showed them through the lower rooms, but they found there no trace of her they sought. As they passed the door of the picture room on their way to the body of the house, M. Mendon said: 
               "Let us enter this first; it is useless to explore the other apartments before we have examined these exterior rooms." 
               "You'd better not, Marse Adolphe. You'd better not. It's a fearsome place in thar, an' de great dog what stays in it is dangerous. He hasn't been rampin dis mornin', more's de wonder, for he jes' fills de house wi' his yowlings 'bout half de time." 
               Father Eustace paused, and decisively said: 
               "It is my will to go in here now. Is the door locked?" 
               "In course it is. He'd never leave dat place open to nobody, I reckin." 
               "Go up then and get the key." 
               After a few faint attempts at remonstrance Eady obeyed, and the two stood in gloomy silence until she returned. She said: 
               "I thought de marster would ha' bin ravin' mad at seein' me bring de key away, but he kinder larfed, for de fits off n him now, when I took it up, an' he tole me to say dat he wanted you to 'port to him what you found in thar. Oh me! I'm dreffly afraid it's somethin' awful." 
               With a feeling of nervous trepidation, M. Mendon thrust the key into the lock, and discovered that it had already been turned back. Dreading what the next instant might reveal, he threw the door back with a crash, and the light from the entry fell within the dim room. 
               Eady sprang forward with a cry, and seized a fragment of the black robe which Adrienne had worn the previous day; this was hanging from the mouth of the bloodhound, whose strong and agile form lay stiffened in death. A struggle had evidently taken place, for the table was overturned upon him, and the priest, who was a good chemist, decided at once that the hound had been suddenly placed hors du combat by having prussic acid thrown upon his head, which had instantly destroyed him. Fragments of broken glass were scattered upon the floor, that still retained the scent of the bitter almonds from which the deadly fluid had been distilled, and the hair upon the scalp of the luckless beast was completely destroyed by its corrosive action. 
                
               The negro was trembling and weeping in one corner, as she sobbed: 
               "It's her dress-oh Lor'! what have happened to her, lef' at de mercy o' dat 'fernal creetur?" 
               The priest spoke in stern, compressed tones: 
               "I now understand the use that was made of her key. In a state of unconsciousness, Adrienne was lured from her room, and that old miscreant up stairs suffered her to walk upon what he believed must prove her destruction. She has been providentially aided to escape, and I trust this dead brute was not first permitted to injure her. I see no evidence of such a catastrophe." 
               Eady arose, and clasping the fragment of black serge to her heart, she hysterically said: 
               "Thank de Lor' for all his mercies, an' dis is about de greatest on 'em yit. Yes-she's safe, she's safe, I knows she is." 
               "But where is she? That is now the question that must be solved, for I must find her, and place her under proper protection." 
               "I don' know where she is, an' I darsn't tell ef I did, but dem what owns her has tuck her in han' at last, an' she. won't want for pertection now." 
               "But she belongs to me, and I must find out what has become of her before I sleep." 
               The negro regarded him with a broad stare of astonishment. 
               "I thought she were de marster's gran' darter." 
               "And I am the master's son-in-law. So with my claim on Adrienne thus established, I think you had better not refuse to tell me where I shall be likely to find her." 
               "But s'posen she aint his gran'chile at all, den it stan's to reason she carn't be yourn. Somehow she's got mightily mixed up wi' her 'lations; I has my own s'picions, but dey don't keep even wid yours. Howsever, now my pretty mistis aint had nothin' dreffle to happen to her, I kin fine de heart to go back, an' try an' do suffin for de ole marster, bad as he is." 
               In defiance of the efforts made to gain more from her, Eady eluded every question, or boldly asserted her ignorance of what had actually occurred, and they finally permitted her to return to M. Lecour's chamber. 
               The priest and his companion then examined every part of the room; there was no evidence that Adrienne had been wounded by the dog, though a portion of her dress remained in his fangs. The heavy table, with its array of candle-sticks, had been thrown violently upon his body, and while writhing under the load, they supposed the acid which produced his death had been thrown upon him. How, or by whom it had been done, remained wrapped in mystery, or whether Adrienne had been spirited from that room. 
               They sounded the walls, but they were so covered with pictures that it was difficult to get at them, and after what they considered a thorough investigation, M. Mendon and the priest left the picture-room in a state of complete bewilderment. 
               Adrienne might yet be concealed in some other portion of that large house, and Eady was again summoned to open the doors of the disused apartments, that they might examine every cranny in them. M. Mendon knew every nook, and after a thorough search they returned disappointed and angry to the chamber of M. Lecour. 
               He had passed into an interval of ease, and his malicious eyes sparkled as they came in looking crest-fallen and annoyed. He asked: 
               "Ah, ha! did you find her torn and mangled, with her beauty marred, and life gone from her, as she richly merited? Oh! that she could have suffered some of the pangs that now rack me, before death claimed her; it would have been just retribution for her treachery to me-who would have made her Queen of France. Aye-queen of the greatest nation on earth, if she had only been true to me. But she betrayed me, and I gave her to death." 
               "But she has not perished," said Father Eustace, with stern gravity. "We found no trace of Adrienne Durand, save the fragment of the dress she wore hanging from the mouth of the bloodhound into whose jaws you betrayed her. The dog lay dead, slain evidently in her defence. Providence sent some one to her rescue, and she has been removed from this house by her preserver." 
               As he listened, M. Lecour slowly arose to a sitting posture, looking more like a galvanized corpse than a living man. The purple flush upon his face became of a leaden pallor, and his lips moved without the power to articulate a sound. 
               The efforts he made to speak were shocking to behold, and at length a hoarse cry burst from his lips, and he faintly muttered: 
               "Baffled-baffled at last. Who but the White Terror could have come to her rescue? I know it, and I am indeed accursed." 
               Father Eustace went on: 
               "We discovered nothing which can throw any light upon the fate of this poor child, except a letter which I removed from her portfolio. Perhaps this may furnish some clue to what has become of her." 
               The priest drew from his breast the warning which had so strangely reached Adrienne on the previous night, and read it aloud. M. Lecour listened intently, and then motioned to have the writing held in such a position as would enable him to examine it. After a single look, he closed his eyes, as if to shut it from his sight, and slowly muttered: 
                
               "It is the same-the same. Whence could it come?" 
               Father Eustace could get nothing further from him; he lay like one in a trance, until the spasms again attacked him, and the priest finally said to M. Mendon: 
               "My duty is here, and I cannot leave this dying sinner until he is in a frame of mind to receive the last offices of the church. I came hither with vengeance in my heart, and the will to stain my priestly hands with his blood, but God has vindicated his own words, and left me nothing to do but watch over the passage of my enemy to the solemn judgment of Him who uttered the awful warning-'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.' To the hands of his Maker I must commit him, but you can follow up the slight clue in our possession, and endeavor to discover what has become of Adrienne." 
               "I think I had a better one than you are aware of, furnished me by Madame mre just before I left her this morning. I will not consume time which should be better employed in explaining now, but proceed at once to the house to which I think Mademoiselle Durand may have been conveyed." 
               The priest gave him a penetrating glance, but he assented to the proposal by saying: 
               "Go, in God's name, and endeavor to discover whither she has gone." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               A LOVER'S ANGUISH-A WELCOME DISCOVERY. 
               WHILE these scenes were passing, a young stranger, who had that morning reached the Landing, was rapidly riding toward Bellair, with joy and hope beating high in his heart, for no premonition came to him of the shock that awaited him on his arrival there. 
               Victor du Vernay was not over twenty-three years of age, and his handsome person had full justice done to it by a toilette of Parisian elegance; yet it was the elegance of good taste, and not that of the coxcomb, proud of his personal advantages. His dark eyes were full of fire, yet tempered by softness when his gentler feelings were appealed to, and his raven hair was parted away from a brow on which honesty and truth had set their stamp. The eager and observant mind of the young traveller noted all the peculiarities of the strange country through which he passed, although he was moving at a rate that almost kept pace with his own impatience. He was on his way to see his beloved Adrienne once more, to claim her forever as his own, and demand of M. Lecour the restoration of her rights. He had seen Madame Noiron in New Orleans, and received from her such surprising revelations, that he came prepared to show the old man the impossibility of evading Adrienne's claims. He knew her to be the grand-daughter of M. Montreuil, and his undoubted heiress. A further mystery was hinted at by Madame Noiron, and he was referred to Dr. Brunei for its solution when he reached the neighborhood of Bellair. To him he would go when he had seen his betrothed bride, and light was his heart as he drew near the end of his journey. 
               When Du Vernay came in sight of the dreary woodland that surrounded the old chateau, his spirits suffered a reaction he could not have told why. As he drew up his horse in front of the steps, he wondered how Adrienne had been able to endure existence in so desolate a spot even for a single week. 
               He dismounted, stepped upon the threshold, and was about to lift the ponderous knocker, when the sudden appearance of a gentleman, descending the staircase, caused him to pause and await his advance. 
               M. Mendon, with downcast eyes, and preoccupied air, came almost up to the stranger before he was aware of his presence. He started, bowed courteously, and said: 
               "Excuse me, Monsieur, but my mind was filled with painful thoughts, and strangers so seldom come to this portal, that I was quite taken by surprise at your presence." 
               "You are very excusable, Monsieur. I have business of importance with M. Lecour, and I shall be glad to see him immediately." 
               M. Mendon surveyed him from head to foot, and he said: 
               "I think I cannot be mistaken, Monsieur, you are lately from France." 
               "I am-I only reached the landing above here, about two hours ago. My business admits of no delay; cannot I see M. Lecour at once?" 
               "He is too ill to receive visitors." 
               "I am sorry; in that case, perhaps Mademoiselle Durand will receive me." 
               A sudden light flashed upon M. Mendon. Before him stood the cause of Adrienne's indifference to himself. Her lover had lost little time in following her, and he rather exulted in the blow it was in his power to give him. 
               "M. Lecour is ill unto death from the bite of a rabid dog, and during the past night, his grand-daughter has eloped from the protection of his roof." 
               The listener staggered back as if he had received a sudden blow-he became very pale, and then flushed fiery red. He compressed his lips firmly an instant, and then said: 
               "Your last words are a slander against a young lady I am bound to protect, and at the proper time and place I shall hold you accountable for them. Since Mademoiselle Durand is no longer here, I must see M. Lecour, even if he lies in extremis. In what part of the house shall I seek him?" 
               M. Mendon's lip curled, as he pointed to the staircase, and said: 
               "Yonder lies the way, and self-delegated as you are to become the defender of Mademoiselle Durand, I shall decline the honor of answering to a stranger for the language I have used. Go up, and learn for yourself that I have only spoken the truth." 
               As he finished speaking he passed out with haughty steps, and mounting his horse rode rapidly away. 
               Du Vernay thus left to pilot himself in a strange house, was rather at a loss what to do next, but as he heard the murmur of voices from the apartment above, he finally concluded to follow the directions he had received. 
               Lightly ascending the staircase, he advanced to the open door of M. Lecour's chamber, and stood a moment upon its threshold surveying the strange scene it presented. The old man had again been attacked by convulsions, and the three persons who remained with him, were endeavoring to hold him upon his couch, while he struggled against them, bit and tore the clothing upon his person, and seemed in fearful agony. 
               When the paroxysm had passed, and he lay panting and motionless, the priest turned courteously to the stranger, and said: 
               "You have come hither at a sad time, Monsieur. The master of the house is in no condition to receive visitors, if your business is with him." 
               "I had affairs of great importance to settle with him, but it seems I am too late. Death will anticipate any claim I may have against him. You do not remember me, Father Eustace, for in the six years since we have met, I have outgrown your knowledge. I am the son of your old friend, Alphonse Du Vernay." 
               The priest grasped his hand warmly, as he said with some show of feeling: 
               "Your father was the friend of my youth, and from him I received many favors. His son is welcome to Louisiana, and if I can aid him in the business that brought him here, I will do so as far as lies in my power. May I inquire what has induced you to come hither?" 
               "It is too long a story to enter on now, and here, but I may tell you that I am empowered to act as the agent of the Montreuil family to settle the succession to this estate. The claim of M. Lecour is not valid-but of that hereafter. Is it true, Father, that Mademoiselle Durand is no longer under the protection of her reputed grandfather? I was told so, very rudely, by a person whom I met below, but I cannot bring myself to believe such a thing." 
               "Adrienne has disappeared in a very extraordinary manner, but I am very sure that no blame can attach itself to her," gravely responded the priest. 
               "Tell me, I entreat, what has actually occurred," said Du Vernay with feverish impatience, for his heart began to thrill with painful doubts as to the safety of his beloved Adrienne. 
               In a guarded voice, Father Eustace related the events of the past night so far as he understood them himself, and the lover listened with horror and fury depicted upon his face. He bowed his head a few moments to recover calmness, and then turned to M. Lecour and spoke to him. 
               He now lay quiescent and exhausted, but like a crushed serpent he would have concentrated all his venom in one final blow, if he had possessed the power to render it mortal to him who came empowered to strip him of the wealth he could no longer grasp. His eyes flashed with malignant fire upon Du Vernay as he spoke. 
               "I came hither, Monsieur, empowered to claim the heiress of Bellair and her fortune. The last you can no longer use, and I entreat you to inform me what you have caused to be done with Adrienne Durand?" 
               "Address no entreaties to me, I have no information to give." 
               "Then I demand her at your hands, and she must be forthcoming." 
               "Seek her, as I told the others to do. I neither know nor care where she is. Take your presence from ray sight, for it is odious to me. Why should you dare to claim the land and gold that are mine, mine? What do I care for a settlement made by old Montreuil? Have I not the deed of gift executed by his daughter? The estate was her inheritance, and she had the right to dispose of it as she pleased. Go-go-find Adrienne if she is yet upon the earth, but I believe, I hope she has preceded me into the grave to which I am fast hurrying to meet her. Ha! I will clutch her, and hurl her down to destruction with myself. Oh horror! I burn! I burn! yet water cannot quench my raging thirst. Kill me-let me die at once!" 
               He again fell into spasms of such violence as to task the utmost strength of the three watchers to prevent him from rolling upon the floor. 
               Du Vernay looked on in silent horror until the sufferer again lay passive and nearly breathless. He then said to Father Eustace: 
               "Can I examine the room into which my poor Adrienne was so cruelly lured last night? Perhaps I may discover some clue that has escaped your search." 
               "The apartment immediately beneath this is the one, and you will find the door open. It will be a satisfaction to you to make a thorough investigation, though M. Mendon and I have already done that without any result." 
               Permission thus granted, Du Vernay descended and entered the picture-room. When he looked upon the powerful frame of the dead hound, tears came into his eyes, and his blood thrilled with rage at the thought that a delicate, fragile girl had been left to the mercy of such a creature. 
               His first effort was to throw more light into the room by opening one of the window-blinds. So long a time had elapsed since they were unclosed that it required much effort to loosen the rusty fastenings. They, however, at last yielded, the shutter was thrown back, and the bright sunshine streamed into the room, lighting up its ghastly pictures, and showing the graphic power possessed by the artist to depict scenes of suffering and despair. 
               Du Vernay slowly traversed the apartment, examining every crevice, and sounding the walls as he went. Three times had he made this circuit without any result, and his heart began to grow sick within him. Suddenly his eye fell upon a small white edge projecting from the under side of a picture-frame which contained a full-length portrait of the Due D'Orleans, the former patron of M. Lecour. 
               He carefully drew forth a small strip of paper, on which was hastily written: 
               
                  "If Victor Du Vernay should come hither to find some trace of Adrienne Durand, he must at once seek the friend of her mother, of whom he received information in New Orleans; he will from him hear a satisfactory explanation of what occurred last night. In the meantime, he may feel assured that Adrienne is safe, though far from well. Be silent, and act for yourself. Trust no one."
                
                
               Du Vernay's face became radiant as he read those words, and he pressed them with rapture to his lips and heart. His beloved Adrienne was saved-was under the care of friends, and all would yet be well. No wonder she was ill after the awful fright she had received, but he would soon nurse her back to health, hope, and happiness. 
               In his ecstacy at the sudden lifting of the heavy weight that had oppressed his heart, he made a false step, stumbled over the body of the bloodhound, and fell heavily forward against the picture of Egalit; the canvas tore apart, and the hollow sound that reverberated from the wall against which he struck convinced him that a passage leading from the room would be found behind that picture. 
               He sprang up, tore the frame from the wall, and to his surprise found that it was hung on hinges; the spring which had held it together was imperfectly fastened, and in a few seconds the dead white wall beneath it was exposed to view. This panel was of painted wood, while the others were plastered. 
               Du Vernay struck eagerly and loudly upon it, with the certainty that there must be some means of opening it from the opposite side. With a heart that beat tumultuously over his task, he made a diligent search for the secret by which it could be unclosed. At length he was rewarded by discovering a very small knob near the floor beneath the lowest hinge on which the picture frame hung. 
               A strong pressure on this caused the panel to slide back, revealing the interior of a small room which occupied the space between the wall of the tower and that of the house, which was given to the staircase in the rear of Adrienne's room. Victor stepped into it, and by the dim light that fell from the outer apartment, examined its contents. He saw from the broken retorts, empty jars, and other fragments of a chemical apparatus, that it had once been fitted up as a laboratory. 
                
               There was a door of communication with the room beyond, but it was securely fastened, and there was no window or other aperture by which the existence of this nook could be detected from the outside of the building. 
               That M. Lecour was entirely ignorant of this entrance to his sanctum he could well believe, and Victor examined it with as much accuracy as the imperfect light would permit. He found one of the wax candles which had evidently been removed from the picture room, and a bottle of phosphorus by its side showed the means used to light it. 
               Carefully closing the door behind him, and replacing the broken picture as well as circumstances permitted, Du Vernay again ascended the staircase to speak with the priest before leaving Bellair. He remembered the caution he had just received, and determined that not even to a father in the church would it be prudent to be communicative in the present crisis of his affairs. 
               When he came into the chamber of M. Lecour, he found him sleeping, and the priest kneeling beside him repeating a form of exorcism, while he held the cross with the sculptured figure of Christ upon it, above the head of the sick man. As soon as he discovered the return of the stranger, he arose and said: 
               "I am trying to remove the evil spirit that has haunted this miserable man through life. It is my duty as a Christian priest to pray for him, but there are such wrongs to be atoned for that my nature at moments almost rebels against the task I have imposed upon myself. His hand has been raised against every one, and it will be almost cheating purgatory to let him pass lightly through it." 
               He spoke with such stern bitterness, that the listener knew some great warfare was going on in his heart. What it was, or whence it originated, Du Vernay could not tell, so he merely said: 
                
               "I am about to seek the residence of Dr. Brunel, and I shall be glad to have such directions as will enable me to find it without delay." 
               "When you get to the overseer's house, which is but a mile from this, turn down the river, and the first respectable-looking place you come to is La Sant, as the doctor calls it. You cannot miss your way. From your silence, I presume your quest in the picture room has been as fruitless as mine was." 
               "I have examined the horrible portraits it contains with a great deal of interest," replied Victor, evasively. "For traces of Adrienne, we must seek elsewhere, I believe." 
               The priest gave him a penetrating glance, but he only said: 
               "You cannot mistake the road to Dr. Brunel's, if you follow my directions." 
               "Thank you. Where shall I find you, if I should wish to communicate with you again?" 
               "A double duty chains me here, though they are entirely antagonistic-that of the Christian and the avenger. Which will conquer, God alone knows; but I must remain beside this old man as long as life lingers in his frame. Bring Adrienne safe to me, and mercy may conquer, but if--You found nothing, of course. After the search made by M. Mendon and myself, it was folly to expect it." 
               "I found nothing to induce the belief that any injury has been inflicted on Mademoiselle Durand, and I have the hope that she will soon be restored in safety to her friends." 
               Victor departed, and while he proceeds toward the house of Dr. Brunel, we will precede him to La Sant, and again join M. Mendon. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. 
               IN a state of extreme agitation and excitement, M. Mendon approached the dwelling which might at this moment shelter one he had long believed dead. 
               The suspicion that Louise yet lived having once been admitted to his mind as a possibility, he recalled every incident known to him which might be admitted as proof of the fact. The old boyish affection he had borne her came welling up in his heart again, and by the time he reached the door of Dr. Brunel's cottage, he felt almost like asking if Madame Mendon was there, for he could not bear to think of her by the name of the old miscreant from whose wretched death-bed he had just come. 
               Dr. Brunel was at home, and the visitor was at once ushered into his study. This was a little box joining his wife's dressing-room, fitted up with two book-cases filled with medical works, and two comfortable arm-chairs. It was filled with a cloud of tobacco-smoke, for the physician was a devotee to his pipe, and he now sat with the long stem of one between his lips, slowly inhaling the aroma of the weed in which his soul delighted. His ruddy, good-humored face loomed like a full-moon from behind this mist of his own creation, as he heartily said: 
               "Walk in, M. Mendon-take a seat, if you please. I can receive but one guest at a time in my little den, but I always make him welcome. I hope no one is again ill at Corona. The quadroon was a hopeless case before I saw her. I wish the Madame would take time by the forelock the next time she sends for a physician." 
               M. Mendon hesitated an instant to find an excuse for his call, for he was seldom in the habit of seeking Dr. Brunel socially; but he finally said: 
               "I have just come from Bellair, and I left its master lying at the point of death; before many more hours have passed away, M. Lecour must be numbered with the dead. As there was no one else to summon you to his aid, I thought perhaps I had better do so myself." 
               A remarkable change took place in the rubicund face of the doctor as he listened to this announcement. He threw down his pipe, bustled from his chair, and exclaimed: 
               "Can't live! Are you sure-perfectly sure! Oh! it's too good news to be true! I help the old villain! no, indeed. I'd sooner sink all my medical skill in the Inferno than try it on him. Oh, Lord! I am afraid I am a very poor Christian, but I believe I shall shout a pan of thanks if your news is only true. Tell me over again: Is he really dying? Has his own venom struck in at last, and poisoned him?" 
               "Not exactly; but as nearly as I could ascertain the circumstances, M. Lecour was a few days since slightly injured by a rabid bloodhound he kept chained in one of his lower rooms. He was not aware of the condition of the animal, and the wound was neglected until it was too late to do anything for him." 
               Dr. Brunel's face looked awe-stricken. He said, in suppressed tones: 
               "It is God's judgment on him for his treatment of that poor child. I have felt ever since I knew that, as if I must lay violent hands upon him myself, but God is over all, and he truly rules all things for the best." 
               M. Mendon caught the sense of his muttered words, and he thought it best to speak at once of his errand. 
               "You are then aware of what has happened to Mademoiselle Durand at Bellair, and you doubtless know the place of her retreat. For Heaven's sake, relieve my deep anxiety by giving me the assurance that she is safe." 
               Dr. Brunel seemed embarrassed, but he said: 
               "I may tell you that much, I suppose. The young lady is safe so far as life and limb are concerned, but the fright she received may yet produce the most painful results. This must suffice for the present; but pray give me all the particulars of M. Lecour's illness, for they are of vital importance to more than one person in this house." 
               Thus urged, M. Mendon, with graphic force, depicted the condition of hopeless suffering in which he had left Lecour, and declared his belief that no hope remained of his surviving beyond the next twenty-four hours. The doctor rubbed his hands together at this assurance, and then apologized for rejoicing at the death of a fellow creature, however low in the scale of humanity he might have fallen. He ended thus: 
               "The fact is, I am so deeply interested in another party, that I lose all sympathy with the miscreant who has made her life wretched." 
               M. Mendon impressively said: 
               "Dr. Brunel, I am aware that you refer to my sister-in-law, Madame Louise Mendon. I have very strong reasons for believing that she did not die in your house, as was universally reported and believed at the time of her attempted suicide. With the assistance afforded her by your medical skill, she was enabled to impose this belief upon her wretched tyrant, and also on the little community around her. Until very lately I, like the rest of the world, have been deceived, but circumstances have lately come to my knowledge which lead to the conviction in my own mind that Louise yet lives. I did not believe that my sister would have so deeply mistrusted me." 
               Dr. Brunel stared at him in blank amazement and uncertainty. He finally asked: 
                
               "Why, what would you have had her do? She was--Yet, no; I have no right to speak of this yet, nor do I know what ground you can possibly have for your assertion." 
               "It is too late to recede now, Doctor. Besides, I have the best assurance that Louise yet lives, for she spoke to me herself in the hall of the old house only night before last. I recognized her voice then, and reflection has convinced me that it issued from the lips of a living woman, and not from a shadow." 
               "Bless my soul! then why did you not test it by placing your hand upon her? You could soon have distinguished between a phantom and real flesh and blood." 
               "I did make the attempt, but she evaded me. But I have now come hither determined that she shall not do so again. I come as her friend, and that of her daughter, for I am aware that Adrienne Durand is not the descendant of M. Lecour, but the child of Louise Montreuil, who was in infancy committed to the charge of Lecour's daughter, to be reared as her own." 
               The listener regarded him in mute surprise; at length he said: 
               "Truly, M. Mendon, you are a much shrewder person than I took you to be. But I cannot act in this affair on my own responsibility. I must consult the wishes of another. Pray excuse me a few moments." 
               "Certainly. If you go to seek Louise, say to her that I am as much her brother now as in those earlier days when she was both mother and sister to me. She need have no fear of me, for I pledge myself to protect her through every difficulty that may beset her path." 
               The good doctor shrugged his shoulders at this assurance, for he had taken a pretty accurate measure of Mendon's character; but reflecting that he had no right to doubt the sincerity of the speaker, though he had many unspoken reasons for doing so, he went out, and with hurried steps crossed the yard toward a cottage similar in size to the one occupied by himself and his wife. 
               It was embowered in evergreens, and he drew near the entrance with light and cautious steps. The door was left slightly ajar, that the fresh air might constantly circulate in the room, and pushing it open, he entered a cheerful looking apartment in which were two ladies. 
               On a bed covered with white drapery lay a fair young girl, folded in a deep, almost breathless slumber. Her long, golden hair was spread out upon the pillow that supported her head, and loving fingers had evidently taken great pains to smooth it, and place it in heavy rings that glittered in the light with a golden sheen. 
               The hands of the nurse were still engaged in toying with it, as if she could not be contented unless she touched something belonging to her precious charge. The person who occupied this position was a wasted, delicate-looking woman, who wore the garb of a sister of charity. A large black cap encroached upon her face, entirely changing its character; yet an acute observer would have remarked a striking resemblance between the sharpened profile of the nurse, and the delicately chiselled one that lay upon the pillow white and motionless, as if sculptured from Parian stone. 
               The doctor came up to the side of the bed before his entrance was observed by the preoccupied sister. She started and looked alarmed as he softly inquired: 
               "How is our patient now, Sister Ccile?" 
               "You see how heavily she still sleeps. I begin to have strange fears. Oh, Doctor, will she ever, ever awake again to health and sound reason? That fearful shock was too much for so delicate a being as she is." 
               "Oh, she is stronger than you think. I have great hopes that she will soon be quite restored. If she is not aroused by a sudden shock, all will be well, I trust. We must guard against that." 
               "You are sure you are not deceiving me? Oh, what should I do if she were snatched from me now? The little reason I have left would surely desert me then." 
               "Never fear-never fear: Adrienne will be all right enough in a few hours. I have something of importance to communicate to you. You can leave your charge a few moments, and come into the next room with me." 
               Sister Ccile looked up at him with sudden alarm in her face, but she resolutely closed her lips till the door was closed between herself and the sleeping girl. Then, grasping the doctor's hand with nervous clutch that almost pained him, she asked: 
               "What is it? Any new atrocity on his part? Any new torture to try me yet more deeply than I have already been tried?" 
               "No, no, poor child, still your apprehensions, for this time I come as the messenger of good tidings. Louise, your persecutor lies upon his death-bed; a few more hours, and all will be over." 
               She sunk upon a chair overpowered, yet incredulous. 
               "Are you sure of this?" she wildly asked. "Yet you would not mock me, my good, my trusty friend. Through all my evil fortune you have stood by me, and my heart thanks and blesses you for it. Tell me what has happened to-to-that miserable old man? and who was the bearer of the news?" 
               "One who was once tenderly attached to you, who professes to be your steadfast friend now. Adolphe Mendon came hither to summon me to the assistance of M. Lecour, and also to obtain an interview with you, if that is possible." 
               "How? does not Adolphe, like all the rest of the world, believe me dead?" 
                
               "Until of late he did; but by some means he has obtained a hint of the truth. He says that he recognized your voice the other night when you were playing the part of the ghost in the old hall at Bellair." 
               A faint smile crept to the lips of the listener, and a singular expression gleamed in her eyes, which at once betrayed that some chord in that finely organized nature was jangled out of tune. There was a glance of fiery exultation and a wild cadence in her voice, as she said: 
               "I could not resist the temptation to answer a question he unconsciously asked aloud, especially as I hoped the assurance I gave him would lead him to protect my poor helpless darling. It had not that effect, however, and but for my assumed character on the following night, his dagger would have drunk the life-blood of my child. And he is dying-dying! Ah! I thought he was the incarnation of evil, and must endure forever." 
               "Yes, Lecour is dying. At first I refused to go to him, but I have become more human since I have talked with you. When Adrienne awakes, and I find all is well with her, then I will go to Bellair to see if my skill can allay the sufferings of the doomed wretch on whom I sincerely believe the vengeance of God has fallen. Adolphe Mendon awaits my return to my study to reveal to him the truth regarding yourself. There can no longer be danger in doing so. What shall I say to him?" 
               "Are you sure he can be trusted? and is-is my persecutor beyond all aid?" 
               "I can confidently assure you that he is, for there is no remedy known to medicine for the deadly virus he has received into his system. As to Mendon, he has nothing to gain by treachery toward you, and therefore I think he may be safely confided in. Besides he may be of assistance to you in the assertion of your just rights." 
                
               Louise pointed to the next room, and sadly said: 
               "No-her rights, not mine. I have none-desire to have none. I am now and forever only Sister Ccile of the holy order of Charity. Impress upon Adolphe that only to my nearest friends must my continued existence be divulged. I must remain dead to the world. Reveal to him all my sad story, and then tell him he may seek me when my child is out of danger." 
               As Dr. Brunel was leaving the cottage, she arrested him to ask: 
               "Have you heard nothing from Victor Du Vernay yet?" 
               "Not yet, but he will come in good time. I placed the note you wrote where he will be likely to find it, or he is no true lover. Of course, when he reaches Bellair, he will search the room Adrienne was last known to enter with assiduous care. He must find your missive; but, at any rate, the business that brings him to this neighborhood must lead him to me, though he is not aware of who he will find here awaiting him." 
               Louise glided back to her post, bent fondly and apprehensively over the face of the sleeping girl, to assure herself that she still lived, by feeling the play of her breath upon her own cheek. With a sigh she sunk back upon her seat, and again commenced her task of turning the shining hair over her fingers, and arranging it anew every few minutes, though this was done with such delicate care as not to disturb the sleeper. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               THE WHITE TERROR IS UNVEILED. THE END OF AN EVIL LIFE. 
               M. MENDON impatiently awaited the reappearance of his host, and when Dr. Brunel again came in, he immediately said: 
               "May I inquire if Mademoiselle Durand has been brought hither, and is now under your protection?" 
               "She is, and I am authorized by her mother, to reveal to you the facts of her most singular and melancholy history. You may remember the opposition of all her friends to her union with her last husband? and how completely she was deserted by them when it actually took place?" 
               "I am aware of that, and recent revelations have been made to me which showed the source of the power possessed over her by M. Lecour. Louise should not have been induced to give him her hand by threats of exposure which her friends would have ended in a very summary manner. It was weak and ill-judged." 
               "Ah, you forget, Monsieur, that Lecour had a timid and sensitive woman to deal with. She still believed that her marriage with Henri Durand was a mere form; that her child bore the stigma of illegitimacy; and the thought that these disgraceful facts might be made public nearly deranged her. In a moment of desperation, she consented to give her hand to her persecutor, and he did not allow her time to reflect or retract her plighted word. As soon as a priest could be obtained, the marriage ceremony was performed, and the unhappy Louise bound herself in a slavery which she soon found intolerable. 
               "Words would fail me to describe all the petty tortures to which this helpless woman was subjected by the wretch who had gained a husband's power over her. When he found that music was a solace to her, he even banished from the house the musical instruments which her father had brought from Europe for her use. For a few dollars he sold the organ she played on, and I have it now for her use in the other cottage. 
               "Lecour brought with him from France a helpless idiotic lad, who was kept as a prisoner of state in one of the upper rooms of the chateau, surrounded by a species of regal state, because it seems to have been Lecour's whim to caricature royalty in the person of this poor imbecile. 
               "He made his wife, who had never been called on to perform any kind of labor, the personal attendant of this boy, and she was held responsible for his safety. He removed from her the servants by whom she had been surrounded from her infancy, and substituted strange negroes purchased for the purpose from a distance. 
               "Madame Lecour was a woman of nervous and excitable temperament; but she had been accustomed to kindness and attention to her slightest wish from those around her; for except in one instance, M. Montreuil had always endeavored to promote her happiness. You may perhaps be able to imagine the effect of this change in her destiny upon such a creature as you may remember your sister to have been. She fell into a state of melancholy depression, which was only the forerunner of partial derangement." 
               "My poor Louise!" ejaculated M. Mendon with real sympathy. 
               From this point we take up the narrative of Dr. Brunel, and relate it in our own words. 
               Two years from the ill-omened marriage of Louise with M. Lecour found her with shattered health and a mind vibrating on the verge of lunacy. She was alone in her sitting-room toward the twilight of a brilliant day. The door stood open, and through it fell the parting evening light; suddenly the entrance was darkened by the figure of a stranger. 
               He was a sun-burned, way-worn man, bearing many marks of his hard contest with the world; his hair had whitened to silver before middle age, but at a glance, Louise knew that the lover of her youth, the husband she had believed dead long since, was standing before her. 
               Before this time, she had learned the cruel deception her father had practised upon her, and she knew that the ceremony which united her with Henri Durand had been legal in all its forms; but she had believed him dead when she gave her hand to M. Lecour. 
               Louise attempted to rise, but fell fainting at his feet. Durand lifted her in his arms, chafed her cold hands in his, and poured forth such a passionate tide of love and sorrow as brought back receding consciousness. She started from his encircling arms, and with accents of horror exclaimed: 
               "Touch me not. I am unworthy to be claimed as yours, for I have weakly severed myself from you forever." 
               "What can you mean, Louise?" he apprehensively asked, as he beheld her wild expression and terrified manner. "I knew the deception under which you acted when you married Mendon, and on my release from prison I left you to the enjoyment of such happiness as you might find with him; but now he is dead, and I have crossed half the world to find and claim you." 
               She despairingly said: 
               "And I have given myself to another, who will--" 
               "Defend his rights even to the death," was furiously added by M. Lecour, as he rushed into the room and confronted the two. "Who are you that dares, before my eyes, to hold my wife clasped within your arms?" 
                
               "I am her lawful husband," was the firm response of the stranger, as he drew the trembling Louise more firmly to his side. "I am Henri Durand, and when you came hither to play your base part toward this lady, you knew that I was still living. You were aware of my release from prison, and it was through information derived from your half-brother, Dr. Latour, who was my pretended friend while in the East, that you have been enabled to deceive my wife, and inveigle her into a union with yourself which you knew to be illegal." 
               "I can soon render it legal enough for my purpose," sneered M. Lecour, and he sprang at once upon his adversary, and plunged his dagger to his heart. 
               Encumbered by the half senseless Louise, Durand could make no defence, and he fell dead at her feet. She awoke to consciousness to find herself covered with the blood of her slain husband, and, regardless of the attempts to detain her made by poor horror-stricken Eady, who had reached the door in time to witness the last act in the fatal tragedy, Louise fled from the house. 
               Twilight was falling, and the fugitive eluded those who attempted to pursue her. She passed with fleet steps over the road that lay between Bellair and the river, and with frantic haste plunged into the stream. At that moment Dr. Brunel happened to be riding down the road toward his own home. He saw the white figure that flitted across his path, and the next instant heard the splash of her fall into the water. 
               He was a strong swimmer, and he did not hesitate an instant to throw himself from his horse, and rush to her rescue. The clothes of the intended suicide had become entangled in a pile of driftwood carried by an eddy into the edge of the bank, and Dr. Brunel soon succeeded in drawing her from the water in a state of insensibility. 
                
               Great was his dismay and amazement to recognize by the fading light the features of the daughter of his old friend, the once brilliant and beautiful mistress of Bellair. His own house was fortunately near, and he removed her thither without delay. She was placed in bed, and everything done for her restoration that Dr. Brunel's skill could suggest; but the unhappy Louise only recovered to fall into violent hysterical spasms, and through many hours of that night the faithful friend who watched beside her thought she must die before the dawn of another day. 
               From her wild ravings he learned the cause of her attempt to commit suicide, and he thought in his heart that death would probably be a mercy to her. Still the doctor performed his duty to the daughter of his old friend, and Louise survived the wretched events of that fatal evening, but with a cord in her brain forever shattered. 
               She was not insane, but her eccentricity took the form of a rooted abhorrence toward M. Lecour, and the determination to make his life miserable as far as lay in her power; she frantically insisted that Dr. Brunel should lead him to believe that she had perished from her plunge in the Mississippi. She could never consent to live beneath the same roof with him again, and neither would she listen to the demand that she should denounce him as a murderer. She could not have her sad history thus dragged before the public. Let him retain the wealth, which was her's, until the proper time for the acknowledgment of her daughter arrived. She had already so arranged it that M. Lecour believed Adrienne to be the child of Estelle, and as such, he had for years paid the annuity necessary for her maintenance and education. 
               Louise declared that she would go to New Orleans, join the Sisters of Charity, and by a life of penitence and usefulness, atone for the involuntary sin she had committed. 
                
               By some means M. Lecour learned that his wife had been rescued from drowning by Dr. Brunel, and he furiously demanded her restoration at his hands. Louise vehemently insisted that her old friend should assist her to feign death, and she solemnly asserted that if she were either compelled to return to her tyrant, or divulge all that had marred her existence, she would not live through the misery and degradation that must become her portion. 
               Dr. Brunel was finally moved by her passionate appeals, and a preparation was given her which produced a state of immobility strongly resembling death. M. Lecour was admitted to her apartment to behold her shrouded for burial and placed within her coffin; he stood beside her, and looked upon her colorless face in the full conviction that the spirit which once animated that beautiful form, had finally departed from the world he had rendered miserable to her. On the following day the family vault was opened, and the coffin, supposed to contain the body of the hapless Louise, was placed within it, while she lay upon her bed at Dr. Brunel's, mourning as one that could never be comforted over the tragic sequel to her most unhappy marriage. 
               Old Eady had become deeply attached to her oppressed mistress, and Louise felt assured in her own mind that she could trust to her fidelity. With her assistance, she could carry out the strange fantasy that filled her mind, and which no arguments or entreaties could induce her to lay aside. Her fixed determination was to become a terror to the wretched man who had inflicted such misery upon herself. She was aware that remorse for the part he had played in the bloody days of terror preyed as an incubus upon him, and to allay its pangs, he used a drug which only added intensity to the imaginary horrors that at certain epochs assailed him. One of these was the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI., and she had remarked that Lecour's terrible night orgies always became more frantic toward that time. Louise conceived the idea of adding to his fears, by coming to him at that season as a shadow from the grave in which he believed her to be lying. 
               With the assistance of Eady she could always gain admittance into his apartment and escape again without detection, as she could safely trust to the misty state of intelligence to which M. Lecour would be reduced by the witching time of night; when phantoms are supposed to walk the earth. 
               When Dr. Brunel found how firmly this monomania had taken possession of her mind, he ceased to oppose her; in fact, since justice could not be dealt out to the old reprobate who tyrannized at Bellair, he was rather pleased than otherwise that some punishment should be meted out to him, even in this unusual manner. He made such arrangements as secured the perfect incognita of Louise, and went with her himself to New Orleans when she assumed the office of a Sister of Charity, and saw that she was as comfortably situated as circumstances permitted. She returned punctually to the neighborhood of Bellair every January, that she might play the part of the White Terror to its master, and as Eady always stoutly denied seeing her at all, M. Lecour gradually learned to believe that the phantom shape came only to haunt and render him miserable. 
               An apartment on the side of the corridor next to Eady's cabin was annually prepared for her use, for the reason that it communicated with the garden by a small portico now almost in ruins. To this room was attached the laboratory to which Du Vernay had penetrated. It had originally been used as a dressing-room, but Eugene Mendon had a fondness for chemical experiments, and he had caused it to be fitted up with apparatus brought from France. 
               The key to this outer door was always in the possession of Louise, and by a short path through the woodland she could soon reach her old home. On the night previous to Adrienne's arrival, she had let herself in without the knowledge of Eady, and in the gathering twilight placed herself upon the balcony in front of M. Lecour's window, just beyond the range of vision from within, but in such a position that the concave mirror would reflect her form to him, outlined against the fading light of day. 
               On this evening for the first time, Pierce obtained a glimpse of her as she retreated, for it had been easy enough to prevent the dull old man, with his propensity for liquor, from fathoming her secret. Since she had shown herself to him on that evening, Eady concluded that she would not make a second appearance, as such had not been her custom, but her mania had now assumed a new form. She would appear to him in her bridal dress; she possessed duplicate keys of the cabinet containing her jewels, and ignorant that a new inmate had been received at Bellair, she came up through the private staircase, and entered the room she had once occupied herself. She then clothed herself in her bridal garments and unlocking the door, passed into the opposite apartment. Occupied with the part she herself was playing, the half sleeping form that glided after her was unnoticed by her, and when she came back to the tower, it suddenly struck her half demented mind that it was singular she should have found a fire burning upon the hearth. She approached the bed, and looked down upon its tenant and was nearly as much alarmed as Adrienne herself had been at the wild face of the supposed apparition. 
               This young stranger was probably too clear-headed to be imposed on, and in great alarm lest her well preserved secret should at last be betrayed, Louise consulted with Eady as to the course she had best pursue to impress this new and dangerous interloper of the reality of the supernatural vision that had appeared in her room. Louise refused to believe that the young stranger was other than an interested adventurer, who had imposed herself upon M. Lecour as the veritable Adrienne Durand. She believed her daughter to be too well guarded in her convent home to be permitted to make her escape; and she and her ally concluded that a second appearance would be necessary to sustain the impression produced by the night scene. This was accordingly arranged, and the time of its execution determined on. 
               The apartment of Louis had a dormer window opening upon a narrow parapet which extended to a similar window in an adjoining room. It was a dangerous attempt to pass from one window to the other, for the narrow ledge was only protected by the heavy cornice of the roof, and if she became dizzy she might fall over; but Louise decided to take the risk in preference to the chance of betrayal to M. Lecour. After displaying herself an instant to Adrienne, she passed through the window, fastened it on the outside, and by the time the frightened girl reached the recess, she was safe in the next room. 
               But she carried with her a new cause of anxiety and dread. The momentary glimpse of Adrienne in one of her own dresses, had shown her that the pretensions of the young stranger were not false, and her daughter had ventured into the tiger's den, from which she must now use all her ingenuity to extricate her. But how to do so, without suffering the secret of her supposed death to become known. 
               She knew that Victor Du Vernay had already reached New Orleans, and received such instructions from a fast friend of hers there, as would bring him very soon to Bellair; and until he came she would content herself with watching over the safety of her child, and preventing the execution of any evil that M. Lecour might devise against her. She had written to the elder Du Vernay, informing him of the true parentage of Adrienne, and offering to Victor a large sum if he would come to Louisiana, and claim the estate of her grandfather for her, under a deed of succession made by M. Montreuil just before his death, as a late atonement for the previous wrong he had inflicted upon her. 
               By a singular providence these two young people had already met and loved each other; Louise concluded that it would be best to await the arrival of Du Vernay before attempting anything herself, as she was nervously anxious that her existence should be kept profoundly secret from M. Lecour. As his supposed grand-daughter, Adrienne for a season would probably be safe under the same roof with him, but she did not relax the vigilance of her watch upon him for a single hour. 
               On the morning Eady placed the ring upon the collar of the slaughtered bloodhound, she removed it stealthily, and afterwards, finding that M. Lecour had forgotten the keys of his treasure closet during the dinner hour of the prince, she placed within it the sketch of herself, and the warnings which had rendered him so furious. She had no paper of her own, and she imprudently used a leaf from the portfolio of Adrienne; and at the same time wrote the hurried lines which her daughter afterwards found within it. She had learned to draw in youth, and the accidental discovery in the laboratory of a bottle half filled with phosphorus, suggested to her the idea of the sketch she had made of herself. 
               Some premonition had told Louise that she would at some day need free ingress into the private room of her unscrupulous tyrant, and when a skillful workman from New Orleans was brought to Bellair to construct the iron safe in the wall for the concealment of his hoarded treasures, a large bribe from her induced him to fit the secret entrance behind the portrait of Egalit, and arrange it to open in the same way as that which concealed the door of the iron safe. 
               Through this entrance she often passed into the picture room, and took food to the hound kept constantly chained there. Gradually he became so habituated to her presence that she ceased to fear him, and it was doubtless the resemblance Adrienne bore to her mother which caused him to crouch at her feet, and whine when she came into such dangerous proximity to him. 
               On the night of Louis' removal, she remained on the watch in a most painful state of indecision as to the course she had best pursue; and when the fury of M. Lecour was about to wreak itself fatally upon the innocent girl, she again played upon his supernatural fears with success. 
               When Adrienne was the second time so ruthlessly lured into the picture room, Louise had seen M. Lecour descend, visit the cabin of Eady, and when she saw the use made of the purloined key, she divined his terrible intention, and she cast about in her own mind how to defeat this last crowning treachery. 
               The new bloodhound was not yet her friend, and she felt the necessity of destroying him without a moment's delay. She went into the laboratory to seek the means of so doing, for she knew that many deadly acids were still there. 
               The search occupied some time, and was at last rewarded by the discovery of a phial nearly filled with a liquid labelled prussic acid. She unclosed the panel, and sprung back the picture, ready to risk everything herself to save her child from the fearful fate that she knew menaced her. She was barely in time, for the dog sprang upon the defenceless girl just as the fatal fluid was hurled upon him. He clutched her robe in his fangs, but fell in the agonies of death upon the floor. 
                
               With superhuman strength Louise grasped the sinking form of Adrienne with one hand, and with the other overturned the table upon the struggling dog. She bore her daughter into the room occupied by herself, and endeavored to quiet the violent agitation which seized upon her on being thus suddenly aroused from her strange sleep. The poor girl was also evidently greatly terrified at her appearance, for she recognized the face of the phantom, and in her fright and bewilderment she had not judgment to comprehend the truth. She fell from one fainting fit into another, until the poor mother was fairly at her wits' end to know what to do for her. She feared to summon Eady to her assistance, lest in so doing she should arouse Pierre, and the thought also came to her that Eady's knowledge of what had become of Adrienne might seriously compromise her with her master. 
               It sometimes happened that Dr. Brunel came in his light wagon to the edge of the woodland to convey her to his house, and on this night, as he was returning from a visit of a patient, he thought he would stop and see if he could induce her to return with him to La Sant. Why she had remained so much longer than usual at Bellair he did not know, and he was becoming uneasy. He made the usual signal by a rap upon the floor of the ruined portico, and she opened the door to him as one Heaven directed to bring her the assistance she so sorely needed. 
               Louise rapidly explained who Adrienne was, and what had thrown her into the condition in which she then was, and the horrified physician hastened to give the assistance to the suffering girl of which she stood so greatly in need. He fortunately had his wallet of medicines in his pocket, and a sedative was immediately administered. So soon as it began to produce the desired effect of throwing her into a quiescent state, he removed her in his strong arms to the shelter of his wagon, and drove rapidly toward his own house. 
               Louise held the head of her daughter upon her breast until they reached La Sant, where Adrienne was placed in bed, and such arrangements made as ensured perfect quiet around her. 
               She now lay in a sleep so deep that it seemed impossible to arouse her, and Dr. Brunel considered her situation a very critical one in spite of his words of re-assurance to her mother. Everything depended on her awaking in a calm frame of mind, for he could not conceal from himself that the shock of being aroused from her trance-like sleep to find herself in the very fangs of the fearful bloodhound, had endangered reason, if not life. 
               He kept a most solicitous watch over her, and he looked for the expected arrival of Victor Du Vernay with intense eagerness in the hope that his presence at the moment of returning consciousness might produce a favorable reaction, and prevent her memory from immediately recurring to the frightful incidents of the past night. 
               When this explanation had been given to M. Mendon, he entreated with such an appearance of feeling that his sister-in-law should receive him, if only for a few moments, that Dr. Brunel felt compelled to bear his message to Louise. She knew that a meeting between them must take place, and after a brief hesitation, she said: 
               "If you will sit beside Adrienne while I am gone, I will see Adolphe a few moments." 
               The doctor consented, and the wasted shadow of the Louise he had once known passed before M. Mendon, held out her thin hand, and called his name in her well remembered accents. 
               "Adolphe, since you came back to your old home, my heart has often yearned to communicate with you, but I dared not. My good friend, Dr. Brunel, has informed you of the cruel necessity that has made me but a phantom existence to my former friends." 
               M. Mendon was more deeply moved than he had believed it possible for him to become. He lifted her hand to his lips, and a few genuine tears fell upon it as he said: 
               "Oh, my sister, my darling Louise, it pains me to learn that such a fate as yours should be awarded to so gentle and true a woman as you have always been. It breaks my heart to think of all you have suffered." 
               With singular apathy of manner she replied: 
               "It is past and gone now, Adolphe. Do not bring it back, for my poor brain will not bear much more. I bear a thankful heart for the last great mercy vouchsafed to me. I have regained my child, and secured her future happiness. I am thus rewarded for all I have borne, for amid tribulation, God remembered mercy." 
               There was something in her manner that repelled him, he could not have explained why, and after an awkward pause, he inquired after Adrienne. 
               "Can I not be permitted to see your daughter? She will tell you that I would have befriended her merely because she resembled you, nay, that I loved her for that sweet likeness." 
               "She sleeps and cannot be disturbed. She will never learn the last I trust, Adolphe, for Adrienne's hand is pledged to one to whom her heart is given. Let that suffice. Keep the secret of my continued existence as you value my friendship, and now I must leave you and return to the sick bed of my child." 
               "Ill? I trust she is not seriously indisposed?" 
               "I cannot tell; I greatly fear she is. She has suffered much, and her elastic temperament has succumbed beneath this last shock." 
                
               "She will revive, Louise. God would not restore your daughter but to snatch her from you again." 
               "I sincerely trust to his great mercy," she devoutly replied, and then gently bidding him adieu, she left the room. 
               In a state of mind by no means enviable, M. Mendon returned to Bellair. On the road thither he met Victor Du Vernay, and as reflection had shown him that Adrienne was now far removed from either his power or that of Father Eustace, he came to the sensible resolution to pass as lightly as possible over his disappointment His heart was not so deeply scathed as to threaten any serious unhappiness to him, and he consoled himself for the pecuniary disappointment by resolving to appropriate Pauline and her thousands as speedily as possible. 
               Thus pacifically disposed, he stopped, took off his hat, and courteously saluted the young stranger. 
               "M. Victor Du Vernay, I believe? I have to apologize for my rudeness to you this morning, Monsieur. I was greatly perplexed in mind at the time, which must be my excuse; neither did I then know that I bad the honor to speak with a friend of my sister-in-law, Madame Louise Mendon, and her charming daughter." 
               Victor bowed rather haughtily in return, and replied: 
               "Your excuse is received, Monsieur. As the relative of Madame Mendon, I cannot refuse to accept it." 
               He passed rapidly on as he ceased speaking, and M. Mendon resumed his way with a deeper grudge in his heart toward him than he had ever felt before. 
               He reached Bellair before noon, and found M. Lecour still suffering at intervals, as in the early part of the day. The priest sat beside him absorbed in prayer, trying thus to keep down the surging spirit of vengeance that at moments would arise in his soul. 
               When he heard the sound of M. Mendon's returning footsteps steps, he left the side of the sick man's couch, and went to meet him on the gallery. He eagerly asked: 
               "Have you gained a clue to Adrienne? Since you left I have examined the men I left on the watch last night, but they were so busy looking after two prisoners they made, that they were oblivious to all that passed within the house." 
               "I have found her, and what is more, I have had an interview with her mother," he significantly replied. 
               "It was she who saved her last night." 
               The countenance of Father Eustace scarcely changed at this announcement. With perfect coolness he said: 
               "Ah-h, then you know that my assumed paternity was only an allowable ruse in the game we were playing. I have been aware all the time that Louise is yet living, but tell me how she happened to be on the spot when her daughter most needed her?" 
               M. Mendon concisely related the circumstances of Adrienne's escape, and at the conclusion of his narrative the priest nervously asked: 
               "Did not Dr. Brunel betray to you the cause of the seclusion of Louise? Was not the life of one she loved sacrificed, before she attempted to commit suicide?" 
               "I will tell you, if you will promise me that you will leave vengeance to a higher power." 
               Father Eustace became terribly pale, and after a struggle he said: 
               "I have given him over to the visible power of God, who has wrought out His own retribution." 
               "I know now that your brother fell by his hand." 
               "Where? In this house?" 
               "In the room below; and the stain of his blood is yet upon the floor." 
               The strong man shook as if a blow had been dealt upon him. He turned abruptly away, strode without pausing to the lower room, and looked around it. His eyes fell upon the traces of that twin brother's blood who had once been as a second self to him, and he dropped upon his knees beside it, uttering in agony of spirit: 
               "Give me strength to pardon him, oh, Saviour of the world! enable me to put far from my soul the thought of vengeance against the father of my sainted Estelle." 
               Long did he wrestle in prayer before he could again enter the room of the dying sinner, whose register of crime was full. 
               I could fill pages with the record of that terrible deathbed; could tell how he who had thrust so many out of life, clung at the last to the miserable remnant left to himself; but the picture would be too awful. M. Lecour died with all the forms of the church to which he nominally belonged, carefully administered to him by the man he had so scorned and abused; though the heart of Father Eustace almost recoiled from the task he had imposed on himself as a penance for the double part he had lately been playing. 
               M. Mendon returned to Corona to explain to Madame Crozat why Adrienne did not come to accept the hospitality of that lady. He lost no time in endeavoring to propitiate Pauline, and atone for his late neglect. 
               That he was not unsuccessful, was proved by the fact, that the very next ship that sailed from New Orleans for Havre, carried out M. Adolphe Mendon and his bride as passengers; and it was known among their friends that they visited France for the purpose of claiming a large inheritance which bad been recently adjudged to the lady. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               AWAKE TO LOVE AND HAPPINESS. 
               WHEN Victor Du Vernay reached La Sant, he was received with open arms by the good doctor; and in reply to his eager inquiries, he received the assurance that Adrienne was safe beneath its roof. And when he asked for an immediate interview, great was the consternation of the lover to hear that the beloved one he had come to seek lay in a sleep artificially produced, from which she might awake with a distraught mind and broken life. 
               Du Vernay bowed his head in bitter anguish as he listened to this revelation, and he entreated that he might be permitted to look upon her as she slept. 
               "All in good time," replied Dr. Brunel; "but it will be best for you to have an interview with her mother first; and there are some things which it is necessary to explain to you before that meeting takes place." 
               "I listen to you, Monsieur; pray proceed without delay, for every moment that detains me from the presence of my Adrienne seems an age to me." 
               As briefly as possible, Dr. Brunel related the substance of what has already been made known to the reader. He then went to inform Louise of the arrival of Du Vernay. She soon entered with a sad smile of welcome on her face. 
               She softly said: 
               "I have nursed you in my arms many times, dear Victor, when you were a baby, and Heaven has been kind enough so to order it as to cause you and my darling child to meet and love each other. She has suffered much-much-but I trust in the infinite mercy of our Heavenly Father, that she will yet awake to happiness." 
                
               "She will surely be restored to our prayers," said Victor, fervently. "The precious darling of so many hearts will not be torn from life just as it dawns brightly upon her. God's mercy is too great for that." 
               "I believe it," responded the pale mother; "but the moment draws near in which she must awake. Come with me, and look upon her; but beware how you utter any sudden sound, so much depends on the frame of mind in which she will again awake to consciousness, that we cannot be too careful." 
               With many fears struggling in his heart, Du Vernay followed Louise into the chamber of Adrienne. She still lay so white and motionless, that he almost feared life had already left her frame; but a closer examination showed him that there was around the lips, and over the closed eyelids a faint tremulous motion, which surely indicated that the effect of the potion administered to her was passing away, and in a few more moments the dormant mind would resume its functions. 
               Dr. Brunel watched these indications with deep anxiety. He pressed his finger upon her pulse, and bent his ear over her slightly parted lips. He then promptly proceeded to make the arrangements on which he believed so much depended. 
               Louise was a fine musician, and the organ which had once belonged to her stood in the next room. Since it would be dangerous for her to appear before her daughter before she was prepared to receive her as an actual existence, the doctor placed her at the musical instrument, with instructions to play a soft low air while the door of communication was left slightly ajar. 
               Victor knelt beside the bed, and gently laid one of her passive hands in his own, and Dr. Brunel stood ready to give such assistance as his professional skill warned him might become necessary. 
                
               Thus prepared, the keys of the instrument were lightly and tremulously touched by fingers long unfamiliar with them; but the old melodies the player had once loved could never be forgotten, and sweet and solemn were the tones that floated into the room in dying cadences, like music from some distant sphere. 
               A faint shade of color gradually crept over the whiteness of Adrienne's cheeks, a soft smile parted the lips, and soon murmured words issued from them. 
               "Has my soul passed from earth to heaven? Ah! this must be the music of the spheres that falls so softly upon my ears. Ah, Victor-beloved-if I could only meet you there." 
               "I am here, dearest; open your sweet eyes, and look upon me." 
               Obedient to the command, the heavy eyelids were slowly lifted, and the eyes, with a steady, quiet gaze, looked into her lover's. 
               "Yes, you are indeed my Victor; but how did you get to heaven with me? I had not heard of your death, and that change is necessary to gain admittance in the mansions of the blest." 
               "I feel that I am truly blessed, my Adrienne, for I am beside you, and you are mine; but we are yet on earth, my darling, and you are safe. Do you understand, my love? Safe from every one, and soon to become my bride." 
               She slowly raised herself, looked around the room, and then touched and examined her hands. 
               "Yes, I see now that I am still in the flesh; but tell me how-oh, I remember now! That fearful-fearful room! that terrible old man!" 
               She fell back with such an expression of vivid horror upon her features, that the two who watched her were greatly alarmed. Victor, instructed beforehand by Dr. Brunel what course to pursue, clasped her hand to his heart, and slowly and distinctly said: 
               "You went into the picture room in the sleep of somnambulism, and were there rescued, without injury, from the dog; your mother accomplished this. She it is who has played the part of the White Terror in the house that was once her own. You are not M. Lecour's grand-daughter, but the child of Henri Durand and Louise Montreuil. You are the undisputed possessor of your grandfather's estate, and I have come to Louisiana with the full consent of my father to marry you, and take you back with me to France." 
               While Du Vernay thus spoke, the expression of fear slowly faded from the features of Adrienne, a sad smile took its place, and she said: 
               "My mother? Does she indeed yet live? Where is she now? Will you not bring her to me?" 
               "She is here, but are you sure that you can bear the agitation of seeing her?" 
               "Oh! I can bear anything now. This new flood of happiness has restored my strength; the horror has left me, and I only see bright hopes clustering around me. Already have I looked upon my mother's face, and I shall know it again. Victor, bring her to me, I entreat." 
               "Her good friend, Dr. Brunel, has already gone for her; she will be here in another moment. Calm yourself, my beloved, and do not risk your health by any excitement." 
               She smiled so radiantly, so confidently in his face, that her lover was reassured. She softly said: 
               "Do not fear for me now, Victor. I feel as if I have suddenly been rescued from the depths of despair, and placed upon the very pinnacle of happiness. And it was my mother that rescued me; I now remember the face of the supposed phantom bending over me when I was dragged from--" 
                
               She shuddered, and changed color so rapidly that Du Vernay's fears were again aroused. He hurriedly interrupted her: 
               "Stop, my darling; don't think of that terrible scene. It will make you ill again. Ah! here is your mother." 
               Louise, trembling and pale, came in followed by Dr. Brunel. Adrienne raised herself suddenly, held out her arms, and in another instant mother and daughter were clasped in a fond embrace, weeping as if their hearts would break. 
               Dr. Brunel drew Du Vernay away, as he whispered: 
               "All is safe now; leave them together; it will be best." 
               Louise lifted Adrienne's face from her bosom, and looked tenderly upon her, as she said: 
               "Oh, my child, at last I clasp you to my heart, as mine. How will you be able to forgive me for my apparent desertion through nil these long, long years? Twice in ray life have I visited France only to see you, but you were then too young to remember me." 
               "I have a faint recollection of a lady who once wept over so bitterly that I became alarmed, and had to be removed from the Superior's room. And that was you, my mother?" 
               "It was; and since that hour we have not met till I discovered you in the power of the most ruthless of men." 
               "But why was I kept so far from you, and led to believe myself the daughter of another person?" 
               "It is a story of sad wrong, my child, perpetrated by one who should have guarded me from evil. You shall soon learn all its details. I will explain now that M. Mendon was aware of your existence before I gave him my hand, and he took me to France to visit you; but neither he nor my father was willing that I should acknowledge you as my child. I then believed that my marriage with your father had not been legal, and I shrank from revealing to the world the deception of which I had been made the victim. Now I have the proofs in my possession that Henri Durand was my true and lawful husband." 
               "And are you really and truly my mother?" asked Adrienne, earnestly scanning her features. "It seems so strange-so incredible. But why did you persecute that dreadful old man by making him believe that he was haunted by a visitor from another world?" 
               Again that flash of wild exaltation swept over her face, and her lip curled defiantly, as she said: 
               "He had been the evil demon of my life, and I was resolute to do all in my power to avenge myself. He had crushed me-crushed me; he had given death to one I loved, and I would not forego my only means of wreaking on him some of the misery he had inflicted on me." 
               Adrienne tenderly kissed her mother's brow, as she softly said: 
               "You will now forget your wrongs, my mother, and in sharing my happiness, make it doubly precious to me." 
               "Yes-I have accomplished that, at least, my daughter; you will be honorably and happily settled in life; but I shall not remain with you. A life of penitence and usefulness can alone atone for the past. I have long been dead to the world, and it is my will to continue so." 
               Adrienne would have combated this resolution, but she soon found that the attempt would be useless. The mind of her mother was fixed on resuming her duties as a Sister of Charity, and no arguments could turn her from her purpose. 
               In a few days Adrienne was sufficiently recovered to set out for New Orleans, and she went thither accompanied by her mother and her lover. Father Eustace and Dr. Brunel were also of the party, and the former offered to his niece such an explanation of his conduct towards her as seemed sufficiently plausible to himself, but it was far from satisfactory to the truthful mind of Adrienne. His mission in Louisiana was ended, and he was preparing to return to his native land. 
               The settlement of M. Montreuil's estate detained Du Vernay several months later; but he and Adrienne were united in the Cathedral a few weeks after their arrival in New Orleans. From the day of their union Louise began visibly to fail. Her work on earth was accomplished, and her end was drawing near. The week before her daughter's departure for France she was laid in the family vault at Bellair beside her father. The faithful Eady was with her mistress to the last, and after her death Adrienne gave her the choice to go with her to Europe, or to remain in charge of the old chateau. Pierre's habits were such that it was impossible for him to accompany them, but Eady did not hesitate at once to accept the post of waiting-woman to her beloved young mistress. Arrangements for having Pierre properly taken care of during her absence were made by his new master, and Eady left the dreary old house with a light heart. 
               The hoarded savings of M. Lecour were found to be very large; and as no heir appeared to claim them, they were bestowed upon the convent in which his supposed granddaughter had been educated, for Adrienne retained a grateful remembrance of the kindness shown to herself during her childhood, and she was glad to be able to compensate in this way for her own desertion of the sisterhood. 
               The valuable jewels he had collected were taken to France, and many of them restored to the families to which they originally belonged, on the payment of a tithe of their value to an asylum for orphan children. 
                
               Victor Du Vernay and his lovely wife played a brilliant part in the court of Napoleon, but at his downfall; they again came with their two children to Louisiana, to resume possession of the old place. Before this time the ruinous house had been removed, and a commodious mansion built upon its site. Eady found her husband still living, and still as devoted to the use of liquor as in earlier days, but she kindly atoned for her long desertion by taking care of him the remainder of his life. 
               At the restoration of the Bourbon rule in France, M. Mendon also came back to his old home to take possession of Madame Crozat's plantation, which had fallen to himself and his wife by the death of that lady. In the passage of those years, Pauline had grown sharp and cadaverous, but as she had no children, her step-son forgave her for the deception she had practiced on him to secure his father for herself. Her husband led a quieter life with her than he anticipated when he gave her his hand, and Adrienne never knew that to Pauline's treachery she came so near owing her death. 
               On their return to Louisiana, friendly relations were maintained between the two families, and in the course of time, the only daughter of Madame Du Vernay became the bride of M. Mendon's youngest son, and he thus had the satisfaction of knowing that the half of the coveted estate would descend to his grand-children. 
             
            THE END.
