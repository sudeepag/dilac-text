            PREFACE. 
            I WOULD hesitate long, I think, before I would write a book purposely for publication. This volume is a collection of extemporized articles, written during the last seven years, just as the occasions arose. They are republished now for reasons which I hope the readers will find satisfactory. 
            Of the first division, entitled "Characters and Tales" I wish to say that they are not in any respect or degree, inventions. They have the form of fiction, but, to me they are the very truth of fact. "General Ogle" is as true as I could make it; and "Elizabeth Barton," except the names of the parties, is such a report of the subjects as I would make if I were telling the story in confidence to a friend. 
            The primitive piety and politics of my native mountains are, to my thoughts, the very blood and breath of their life. I wish they had a portraiture answering to their worth. I suppose somebody will be born in time for this use, but till his advent, those who have the sense that feels this want must wait and wish. It is full twenty years since I first felt that these two stories (with some scores besides) must be written, and the obligation haunted me all the while till it was obeyed. 
            The scene of "Euthanasia" belongs to the heart of the City. I could in all good conscience make my affidavit to its simple accuracy. 
             
            I wish to be believed, but I know that when one opens the truth to its core, he is more apt to get credit for genius than for veracity. "The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, is rightly taken for testimony when a qualified witness swears to it, but, in authorship, it is poetry, and, unhappily, it is usually taken to be nothing but poetry! 
            The "Duel", is a different matter. My Grandfather, "many a time and oft" rehearsed it (and the story of the Dead Boxer, which has since appeared in Blackwood's Magazine) to me, as I sat upon his knee in my early childhood. I take no responsibility for its narrative truth, for I have taken such liberties with it as answered my purposes. The same story has appeared in several forms from other hands. I give it here, simply, because I think mine decidedly the best of the lot, and because it affords me the best way for saying some things which I have put into it. It is the only piece of fancy work that I ever made up, and it is not "made out of the whole cloth." 
            With respect to the omnibus load of miscellaneous articles labelled Slashy, Fancy, Politico-economical, and, Religious, I have nothing to say, except, that they were written in all loyalty of heart and mind, and because, I must give them some sort of utterance. 
            The collection passed through the hands of friends whose consent to their republication would weigh something as my warranty, if I might give their names. They had the privilege of dissent fully accorded. The corrections, by the way, were all made with scissors only. No cobbling with the pen was indulged; and I confess that I found the motion to strike out always the best method of amendment. One of those friends very frankly told me that he never saw articles which would better bear cutting up. The criticism was, fortunately, an ambiguous one, and, of course, I interpreted it comfortably. That cutting up was done so bravely upon the copy that, I hope, it will save so much of a similar operation upon the book. 
            I never had any trouble with the titles of the several articles, but, when the volume was to be named; Bless me, what a time I had of it? Everybody suggested everything, and about the same things; but nobody agreed to anything. Miscellanies was the first word, in nearly every case, but not a man or woman would stand to it a minute after it was uttered. 
            I once burned my hand with phosphorus so badly that I was obliged to carry it in a sling for six weeks. How many people were surprised, and in how many ways, that I could do such a thing, and so awkwardly too, and how many gratuitous prescriptions, that were good for nothing, I got for that burn, I will not attempt to say. But extensive observation since, has convinced me that wiser people than I, can burn their fingers, and find as much difficulty in curing them. 
            This Book title reminds me of that burn. Indeed, for about a month, while the title page was in debate, I had my reasons for thinking all the while of that scene in "She Stoops to Conquer," where Messrs. Marlow and Hastings call at the alehouse to inquire their way to Mr. Hardcastle's. Tony Lumpkin facets the difficulty by asking them "gentlemen do you know which way you came?" "No." "Do you know where you are going?" "No." "Do you know where you are?" "No." "Well then, gentlemen, I think you have lost your way" I acknowledge my indebtedness to my friends for about an equal, and equally satisfactory, amount of aid in my search for a title page; and, apprehending that my obligations for this sort of assistance are to be still further increased, I here take leave to record my gratitude in advance. 
            Hannah More defended the introduction of a new word by insisting that we have the same rights as our fathers, and that our children, at least, will not dispute it. Walker allowed the plea, and admitted the word into his dictionary. Scientific journals head their miscellaneous summaries with the titles-Monthly Periscope, Quarterly Periscope. Webster defines the word thus. "Periscopic, a viewing on all sides; a term applied to spectacles having concavo-convex glasses, for the purpose of increasing the distinctness of objects viewed obliquely." 
            Now, there is something in those concavo-convex glasses, that I may as well confess, in this delicately suggestive way, and a great deal, moreover, in the distinctness that may possibly be secured through oblique glances, that seems happily to vindicate the editorial method of treating all sorts of subjects which fall within its range. Indeed, I don't see how an editor can get along without the word when he puts himself into my predicament. For making the plural noun out of the adjective the language is full of examples. 
            I believe that I intend to publish another volume soon, to consist of Essays, Philosophical and Ethical; something more bookish in style, and more elaborate in texture. 
            The contents of this volume were first published in-Putnam, Graham and Sartain's Monthlies, in the National Era, the Philadelphia Daily Republic, the Liberty Herald, Ashton's Gazette, the Youth's Friend, and the Philadelphia Daily Register.

                  GENERAL OGLE-A CHARACTER. 
                  EVERYBODY is, doubtless, everybody else's brother, but the family is very large, and the difference between some of them is quite remarkable. Something is owing to circumstances, but, as a whole generation of men are born about the same time, and have their lifetime under very similar influences, the oddities and genuises that turn up among them must be accounted for, principally, by original differences of constitution. These extraordinary people are not only well distinguished from the majority, but they are even as much unlike each other, so that they cannot be huddled together into conveniently comprehensive species. Every one of them is a variety, and no classification does much service which stops short of individualizing them. I, therefore, do not propose a science with a nomenclature for these hard subjects. Just now I am occupied with one of them for whom, I think, no match can be found, no class designated, whose known characteristics would help in the apprehension of him. 
                  People who don't understand Latin or Astronomy, and thereby miss the allusion of the term eccentric, might be satisfied with it as a general description, but it does not nearly meet the case. It is true, he was not help at a steady distance from, and in a regular curve around, any fixed standard, as a planet obeys its sun, or a satellite its primary; but this was not because he was erratic and lawless, but because he was himself a centre of motion and revolution to others. 
                  The centric and eccentric man agree only in the fact that they are not concentric; they nowhere coincide, and never touch except to cut each other's orbits more or less obliquely. Unfortunately we have no science of character fit for hard service; and so it happens that every instance which we meet with that is specially worthy of study and description, is a puzzle to our philosophy. 
                  We ought to have a chemistry of men, but instead, our ignorance keeps us dependent upon such oracles as Shakspeare, Scott, Dickens, Hawthorne, and the poets who are free of their guild. We want an analysis of human nature for common use; something to help common judgment to the insight and knowledge of high genius; something to be discovered and revealed by the gifted, in such form that it can be clearly comprehended and safely used by the million-as the mysteries of the material world have been put within the grasp and subjected to the uses of the common mind. Men might be divided, for instance, like electricity, into positive and negative. The analogy furnishes a helpful hint. Logic, also, could afford the aid of its correspondences; the absolute and the conditional let in some light; and so, perhaps, by the time the whole circle of the sciences had contributed to the undertaking, the elements of the microcosmic human nature might be somewhat distinguished and defined. Lacking technical terms sufficiently definite and significant, I must endeavor the delineation of the character in hand in the roundabout method of detailed description. 
                  General Ogle, then, was all that is meant and suggested by the words centric, positive, and absolute. He was like Emerson's Representative Men, for the reason that, like them, he was not representative: he was an exceptional, heroic character ter, as Napoleon, Cromwell, and Jackson were: that is, he owed his distinction to the qualities which distinguished him from everybody else, or we never would have heard of either of them. In the language of orator Philips, "he was a man without a model, and without a shadow." Nature is liberal of her extemporaneous productions, but she took care to copyright him, and it is well known that she never issues more than one edition of her standard works; if for no other reason, because the type is worn out by the force of the first impression, and if for any other reason, because copies mutually destroy each other's necessity, and, because reproductions in changed circumstances are absurdities. 
                  General Ogle was not one of a litter. He was made on purpose, and his kind was complete in him. He was of that breed which leaves no heirs and needs no successors. Out of time and place he would himself have been only an oddity, or, perhaps, a monster; but in his actual surroundings of men and things, there was the happiest possible fitness of relations, and everything in him, accordingly, had its full force and virtue. 
                  The region of country which gave him his theatre, and the people who cast the company for the drama of his life, were in such keeping with him as if they had been made for him, and he for them. The scene was laid in one of the mountain counties of Pennsylvania, which lies spread over the junction of two ridges of the Alleghany chain. It is not a valley quite, nor basin, but is slightly curved or cupped from crest to crest of the twin highlands where they interlock and lift the intervale almost to a level with their summits. It has no navigable streams, and its artificial roads are the portages which interrupt the railroads and canals from the Susquehanna to the Ohio river. It is thus situated far inland, and in an equal degree, cut off from the advanced civilization of the Atlantic coast and the sturdy enterprise of the Mississippi valley. The climate is severe, and the soil something niggardly of its fruits, and having few natural advantages to keep it abreast of the progress around it, its inhabitants, fifty years ago, like its forest trees, were nurtured up to a medium growth, and generally arrested there. The valleys on its east and west drained off the overflow of men, as they received the waters destined to mingle with the mightier tides of the world's life. 
                  Development requires conditions, and a sterile soil and dislocated position are unfriendly to great and rapid advancement of a community. But, notwithstanding the general limitation and restraint of life in such circumstances, there are no places more remarkable for producing men of mark-heroes, chieftains, and distinguished leaders-than those which lie in semi-barbarous conditions. Indeed, in most directions the liberty and occasions for individual eminence are larger and freer there than where men are marshalled according to the forms of a higher general cultivation and its authoritative order. The mass lies something lower, but society is by no means so smoothly flat as on the several platforms of a more artificially regulated system. Wealth and poverty are better balanced; they are less injurious to each other; and they do not determine rank and privilege to the extent of repressing great natural abilities, and fostering the arrogance of birth and fortune. Personal character, where men must mingle intimately, gives every one his appropriate place, and democracy is the common law of sentiment as well as of political relations. This checks culture and discredits refinement, but it prevents the severance of society into circles, and leaves ambition free, and eminence possible to all. 
                  In the heathen mythology, the hills are the favorite habitations tations of the gods, and there is something in physical elevation allied to mental and moral greatness, of the kind which men are accustomed to esteem heroic. Whether it is in the air and scenery, or in the discipline of hard conditions, or, whether it finds occasion in the greater difference which lies between genius and mediocrity there, than in the better general state and fortunes of the people who enjoy the more abundant prosperity of valley life, I cannot stop to examine. It suffices that the fact is well established, that mountain regions are quite as capable of noble natures as the ocean shores, and much more likely to exhibit them in relief from the surface of society. Such comparative prominence has, moreover, the effect to exaggerate the points of distinction and push them to extravagance, and to impart a foreign or fabulous aspect to the literal truth, in the judgment of those who are unfamiliar with such conditions and their natural effects. 
                  I do not feel assured that strangers to the style with life of which I am speaking will receive my story with the confidence which it deserves, nor even, that those who are somewhat familiar with the actual history will admit every feature of the portrait which I draw to be the living truth; but my own assurance is so clear and strong that I can only judge the critic by his judgment of it. I know what I assert, and I am upon honor with my readers. Now let me introduce to their acquaintance the Patriarch Politician of my native country. 
                  The person and character of this man, the most ordinary and the most extraordinary actions of his life, were all of a piece; every thread of the web showed the pattern, and, to present him well should all be woven together into his description. His very incoherencies stuck together and suggested each other; they all belonged so decidedly to him. A glimpse of him as he turned a corner, his hat hung upon a peg, his standing attitude, his walk, the elocution of his nasal interjection note, which he executed with as much effect as Wellington could cry "attention" to a British army, or any other act or fact that could happen to him, reminded one of everything he ever did or said in his life. A very singularly odd man, indeed, was he, but not a whit made-up or affected, and without an iota of pretence in him. He was as honest as steel, and as open as day-light; and if he made immense drafts upon the admiration of every man he met, he really believed as earnestly in himself as his most ardent admirer could do, and so he had a perfect integrity and all the corroborating force of it. He was all alive; every moment had its purpose and every action a determinate drift. He knew everything, could do everything, and took the responsibility of everything, and so he "burnt his bigness through the world." He was just what his own organization made him. If he had been wound up at his birth to go by his own springs for his whole life time, he could not have been less affected by external circumstances and accidental influences. He was so ascertained, so clearly pronounced, so inevitable, that no one knowing him could imagine any change of conditions capable of altering him-that transmigration itself could conceal or confuse him-that a pair of wings, a suit of talons, a beak, or a mane, could have smothered or masked the absolute General, or suppressed his individuality. A positive and unconditional nature was his; it spoke out in every tone of voice, appeared in every gesture, and formally announced itself every time he opened his mouth. 
                  Mahomet was somebody certain, selah, verily: General Ogle was his translation into the idiom of the Alleghany Mountain in the nineteenth century. The Prophet's iron earnestness, his robust confidence, asserts itself in the Koran everywhere. Sometimes it bursts out in the midst of a narrative, suspending the sense, to clinch its verity by planting the word "assuredly" as a buttress for the exacted faith; sometimes the word stands alone, a whole paragraph, severed from all relations, personating the absolute and proving it like a voice from the abyss-Assuredly. 
                  General Ogle never opened or closed an argument without drawing up his tall person into an attitude of positiveness and power, starting in with the word percisely, and pointing out with an emphatic pine blank-percisely and pine blank, that the action of the voice, teeth, and lips might answer to the authority and energy of the man. 
                  Imagine a man six feet two inches high, finely proportioned, with some depth of chest and breadth of shoulder added, to make his courage and confidence the surer; take him at the age of forty-five, the acknowledged great man of the world he lives in; one who really never meets a superior in anything to which he makes a claim, full of the feeling, and marked by the manner of a leader in right of eminent fitness and efficiency; his hair brushed straight from brow and temples backward towards the crown, and powdered, and, with an instinct that it was concerned in expressing him, whenever he stood in the open air his hat was lifted or removed often enough to give it all its proper effect in the impression of his presence. His waistcoat was invariably a dark crimson, and his standing coat collar lined with scarlet. His fine large face was always clean shaved, and he wore a bosom frill elegantly negligent, just as a painter would set a superb head in a cloud-wreath. 
                  It was not his dress that he paraded; it was as much as dress could do to match his mien and movement, and, crimson, powder, and ruffles were tame enough to seem modest and unobtrusive in his service. His hat was large, with liberal breadth of brim, turned up behind to accommodate the erect collar, and deepen the pitch of the point which sheltered the brow and repeated and impressed the curve and dip of his fine aquiline nose. His foot and hand varied the effect of his personal beauty by their more delicate elegance; and his boots, crimped and tasselled, relieved the length of limbs and lightened his too imposing grandeur, as rhyming syllables reduce and soften the stride of verse. 
                  He walked with his head a little forward of the perpendicular, as is usual with men whose frontal brain is active, and always with the pleased engagedness of expression in his countenance which marks a man happy in speaking to others, who are as happy in hearing him. No eye ever caught him weary, listless, or vacant; he took no holidays, nor ever knew those remissions of engagement which ordinary people indulge in at the beginnings and finishings of their undertakings. He was always fully employed and equally intent, and the spring in him was not only strong enough for work, but it was easy enough for play: while the tide ran like a cataract, the surface rippled and sparkled with humour-the sunshine in dalliance with the spray-the storm tones rarified into music. His temper was sharp and high, but steady. As it never fell into feebleness, so it never rose into rage; the percisely and pine blank tone of feeling, ever present, kept him too well balanced for that. Extravagance, by other men's measure of sentiment and action, was common enough with him, but he was never hurried into the trepidation of an angry paroxysm. 
                  It is the temperament of such a man, more than anything else, that determines his character. By temperament I mean a condition of the physical organization, a make of muscle, nerve and blood-vessel, and a manner and proportion in their combination. The terms of art used to distinguish and describe these differences and their effects are not exact or, adequate, but I think the words tonic and sanguine answer best to his strength and fervor-the vigor with the glow-the trenchant diamond and its brilliancy; for all the flash about him was the out-leaping of a steady fire. Every faculty within him seemed hung upon coiled springs, answering with electric quickness to its proper excitant. 
                  This man was uneducated, as we phrase it. He owed nothing but reading and writing in his mother tongue, and simple arithmetic, to the schools. He was not deeply read in history, civil policy, law, or general literature; he knew no art or science as a system; but he was none the less equal to any emergency in affairs, or any demand for speculative thinking in matters of life and business. His instincts were so large and true, his feelings so sound and earnest, and all his aims so just and generous, that he always found the truth and right by sympathy with their sentiment, and was ever sure of the required inspiration at the moment of his need. Such, indeed, were his native strength and readiness, at all points, that it is safe to say that, in a representative career of forty years, in the State and National Legislatures, and the incident contact with the pivot men of politics, the General was never nonplussed by his defects of education. The nice taste of fashionable people was often shocked by his uncultured strength and rugged style of utterance; and his lack of scholarship was manifest to a degree that furnished superficial criticism with a frequent feast of good things. Nothing was more common in the village than clusters of boy-men in high merriment over his irregularities, like so many flies, after a rich feast, busy with the broken victuals; but it was only in his absence that the buzzing and blowing happened; his presence, somehow, always held so large a balance of force against the sharpness of the witlings, that the hunting never began till the lion had left the field. 
                  Probably not one man in a hundred can learn to write his own name, spell February, or hit the cases of the personal pronouns, after forty years of age. The General suffered something by his lack of formal training in his youth, which ear-marked his style of speech and composition while he lived. 
                  An amusing instance will illustrate a slight defect of this sort, and his masterly skill in extricating himself, which never deserted him in any such exigency. 
                  Immediately after Madison's second election, he called upon his friend, Governor Findlay, then holding the office of State Treasurer, with the manuscript of a long letter, which he had written to the President, covering the whole ground of our foreign and domestic policy, and especially, the principles and measures of the Democratic party. Mr. Findlay heard it with not a little admiration of its merits, both as to matter and manner; but, glancing at the paper, he observed that the General had, in some hundred instances, written the pronoun I in little with a pop over it; and sincerely desiring to reform it, for the writer's sake, and for the effect that it ought to have; but impressed, also, with his sensitiveness to criticism which in any way impeached his capabilities, he coaxingly suggested the much desired correction after this fashion:- 
                  "An excellent letter, General. A sound letter, sir; full of most capital advice, which Mr. Madison will be glad and proud to receive; and thoroughly democratic in every sentiment. A letter, General, that any man might be proud to write. Views, sir, that will make the administration equal to Jefferson's if they are fully adopted. But, General, they have a court custom at Washington, a small matter, such as you and I are not apt to treat with much consideration, an indifferent little piece of etiquette-a-" Here Mr. Findlay began to stammer. The General's keen eye was on him, and he felt it. 
                  "Percisely! what is it?" 
                  "Oh nothing"-looking over the paper as if it was hard to find; "nothing at all, and, yet, it would be easily altered. A stroke of the pen here and there, merely." 
                  "Pine-blank," said the General. "What is it, Mr. Findlay?" 
                  "Why, General, it has become the custom lately at Washington, to write the pronoun I with a capital letter." 
                  The General was caught, and he knew how he was caught, too, and he must recover himself. 
                  "Percisely, Mr. Findlay; all right-most assuredly, I know-pine-blank-you're right-no question of it." By this time he was ready. "Look here, my dear sir," laying his hand on Mr. Findlay's shoulder, as if to reassure him, for the embarrassment was all on the one side now, "you see, my dear fellow, I had a design in it. When I write to a small pattern of a man, I make my capital I's two inches long; when I write to my equal fellow citizens, such as yourself, for instance, I make them the usual length; but, sir, when I address myself to as great a man as Mr. Madison or Mr. Jefferson, I always make them as small as possible, with a pop over them, percisely." 
                  I need hardly say that the General walked straight to his room and raised every letter of them to the dignity required by the rules of grammar and the etiquette of Washington City, before he dispatched the epistle. 
                  And there was matter in him as well as manner. He had both the insight and foresight of a ruling mind. There were none earlier or more efficient in the support of advance movements in state policy, though, from his inland and isolated locality, his connexion with their execution was less conspicuous than that of his principal cotemporaries. He represented a good fiftieth part of the Keystone State during that stage of its history which gave it its present high position, and his "aye" "aye" upon the journals mark his support of the measures which anticipated and insured its prosperity, percisely, as his "No" "No" bear pine-blank against the projects which principle and prudence interdicted. 
                  Of course the General was a democrat, a democrat in the best significance of the term; for there was breadth and variety enough of man in him to fit him for both the service and sovereignty of the civil state, and to conciliate the duties which he owed to his constituents with the claims he held due from them to himself. A true man in himself, he was false in none of his relations. He purchased nothing by sacrifice of his manliness, and he secured nothing by usurpation. If he did not surrender the head to the members, now lag and linger in constrained equality with the slow-goers, he nevertheless carried the will and conscience of the country with him, and represented the people with the strictest democratic fidelity in the public councils. Right well he knew the mind of his constituents, for it was his own. As he really governed at home, it was easy for him to serve abroad. So, he was neither slave nor tyrant, cheat nor tool, but a freeman in a worthy agency. In the divine order it is appointed that "the elder shall serve the younger," for, in the happy balancings of the thorough man, ambition embraces duty, and government is service. The representative man covers all the space that lies between thrones and things, and thus touching the borders of extremes, he is fitted to harmonize all differences of life, for all this variety blends into unity in himself. 
                  The religious sentiment of this man was strong and active, under modification of his peculiar mental constitution. He was, indeed, incapable of meekness, and suicide would have been as easy to him as repentance, and very like it. Devotion was in him the sympathy of sublimity. All the good and truth of being was grand to him, and he felt its accordance without being overawed by it. The glory in his own soul kindled up in the presence of the Shekinah; he exulted in it, or in the language of the psalmist, he rejoiced in the law of the Lord! The absolute wisdom, the unlimited power, the infinite beneficence, lifted him into adoration, and he prayed standing, with heart erect and aspiration towering. His practical conformity to the requirements of religion was in no spirit of fear or selfish hope, nor, it is but truth to add, in any very strict sense of duty, or simplicity of submission. He honored and observed just what accorded with the pitch and drift of his own high nature, and left, without apology and without regard, all other apprehensions of the prescribed code to the obedience of those who held and needed them. It was at a later day, when the hardest features of his character had quite outgrown the little plasticity which tempered them, that he sent his compliments to St. Paul by a dying friend, with the assurance that he "approved his writings, generally, and entertained for himself, as a man, the highest regard, affection and esteem." This, however, was only an exaggeration of his customary mood, for in his best days he would have offered his arm to an archangel in the style of a democratic president doing the honors of the planet to a distinguished visitor. In a word, he was just himself, percisely-a man that would have stuck to his intercession for the cities of the plain, if he had been in Abraham's place, till he had nothing left but Lot's wife to offer in mitigation of their doom. Moses, though the meekest of men, was bold enough to reply to the threat of destruction to the Israelites, "forgive them, or blot my name out of thy book". General Ogle would not stop at that; he would offer an apology for the unfortunate multitude at the general judgment, in the confidence that everything could be satisfactorily arranged afterwards by his own kind offices. 
                  Of his moral conscience, I am safe in saying, it was just the balance of his own impulses and opinions. His feelings settled the right and wrong of things among themselves without any reference to received standards. No prophet could be more confident of his inspiration than the General was of the oracle within him, and he was, moreover, not the man to desire a favor out of rule; to pray or wish, in thought or word, for a personal benefit to soul or body, or to fear or evade any legitimate consequence of his own large liberty of soul. The accordance of his opinions and practice with the universal law depended, therefore, entirely upon the concurrence of his own constitution and conditions. This much observance he frankly gave, and he offered no lip-service and added no slavery besides. His was a lofty love of right, a quick and deep apprehension of the divine order, and a bold acceptance of the inmost truth of things. For the rest-the application of principles to conduct, in the regulation of his social life, he held his impulses fully capable and most worthy to direct him, and all in the most confident reliance upon the perfect understanding subsisting between himself and the Supreme Authority. 
                  I must insist again that he was religious, true and noble; yet, it must be admitted, in such wise as allowed much in him incompatible with received rules, and, perchance, with the absolute right too. For in a character where the natural constitution is every thing, whenever the balance breaks, the most startling incongruities will result. Where the standard of faith and practice is a prescribed one, resting on its proper authority, in all exigencies and disturbances, the man still gravitates toward the point which is the fixed centre to his homage; but where liberty is law and the life is all spontaneous, in the confusion of accident and misadventure, the direction is apt to be assumed by the boldest sentiment and strongest feeling, as provisional governments arise in insurrections; and, like them, the decision is likely to be ruled by the dominant interest of the hour. The individual is best asserted and shows most nobly in such case, but is liable to work most widely out of the general harmony, and to shake the authority of creeds and precedents by his aberrations. 
                  The General, I need hardly say, was no hypocrite or juggler in casuistry; for the incongruities and inexplicable things that puzzled every-day orderly people, were true enough things to him, though false to them and to the general rule too; but it is strictly just to say in mitigation of the blame which they encountered and the mischief which they worked, that they were never perpetrated in wantonness or selfishness, but to attain such ends as were likely enough to justify themselves when they were attained. In such minds, efficiency and the necessity of the case override formal systems, and the rule bends to the purpose; that purpose having first secured their approbation for the highest reasons. They are often breakers but never despisers of the "higher law," and if they leave the open pathway of the abstract right, by any constrained indirection, they will recover it again if it can any way lead them to their end. The best of Israel's kings was found unfit to build the temple. The great passions of great natures burst out into great crimes. Little men cannot not judge them. They neither prove corruption nor authorize imitation in petty villainies. The midnight incendiary cannot justify himself by the devastation of a flash of lightning, and philosophy reverently hesitates to impeach the power with the mischief which it works. 
                  As an example of the General's mode of reasoning, and the morale of his logic, he shall answer in his own style. Suppose an Indian war to be the subject; its providential results, rather than its justice, being its warranty. 
                  "Percisely," he would say, "you mustn't look at a great national movement the way a magpie squints into a marrowbone; history isn't written with the point of a pin. The Canaanites were the Indians of the Holy Land, and when the cup of their iniquities was full, and the Cavaliers and Puritans of that day wanted room, and had the better right of better men to fill it, Jehovah told them pine-blank to oust the lounging varlets. Ye see, the Lord of the vineyard cannot tolerate mere cumberers of the ground. The Copperheads take up more room than the rest of the world can afford them! They are, in fact, the greatest land monopolists in the universe, and the most worthless squabs at that; so, the fine fellows must either go to work when the time comes, or else pull up stakes and put out for the Rocky Mountains, or for kingdom come. The earth must be farmed, not foraged, by man; and the vagabonds that have neither forts nor fences must give it up; their case is past praying for; burnt brandy wouldn't save them. Besides, a new world was wanted for the new system-Democracy required a fresh soil, a wide field, and a clean sweep, to set up with; and, this was just the continent fit for the use, percisely!" 
                  With him a policy depended upon its wisdom and fitness; not, however, always the wisdom and fitness of first principles, unless they would work kindly for his uses, but the wisdom and fitness of the end in contemplation, and a strict observance of all the equities which, in the circumstances, it was possible to preserve. That which seemed to him the necessity of the time, got credit for being the duty of the time, and he did it, running the hell-gate of expediency as safely as any other navigator of that dangerous passage; for he mixed up no mean or personal ends with the motives of his conduct, and, especially to the credit of his integrity, he never mouthed and mumbled the maxims of morals and religion while dispensing with their acknowledged obligations. What he did he believed in. He was never caught dodging under the doctrine of human depravity and necessary imperfection, when he was engaged in his greatest undertakings. He verily believed that the best thing that could be done in the circumstances was right before heaven and earth; and, being so, he had no apology to make, but did whatsoever his hand found to do with all his might. His was not the expediency of a narrow mind or a beggarly soul; and he was not a time-server, but a politician, a practical man, the man of his own day; not behind it, but enough before to advance it; not so much so, however, as to be its prophet only, but such a combination of speculation and experience as meets in a prophet-king-the hero of his own age, though a questionable one to the age that follows, if it but proves as much better than his own as he would have it to be. 
                  Of course, in some of the exigencies of his life, the rule got rather accommodating application to circumstances; but these were only the variations of the needle, which left its polarity unaffected and available when the disturbing cause was removed. He was no exception to the rule "no man liveth and sinneth not," but his errors were those of a brave and candid heart. 
                  The General's affections were quick, strong and constant; his friendship generous and enduring; his benevolence wise and steady. His sensibility to every form of beauty and his recognition of eminent excellence, answered like a spiritual echo to the touch; for he was as capable of the luxuries as of the ruder heroics of a noble nature; and the beatitudes of affection were richly enjoyed amidst the business and burdens of his crowded lifetime. He would have been a much less man for any uses, if he had crushed out the sweetness to strengthen the wine of life. It is not the loss of one sense that sharpens another, but its own enhanced activity, compelled by the deforming and distorting deprivation. The dismemberment of either soul or body is not necessary to the development of any special excellency. The General was not a monster but a giant, symmetrical and complete. 
                  Responsibility for poor men's debts, and the actual payment of them in the last extremity, and the general care and direction of the improvident and incapable people in his large acquaintance, rested on him constantly, and was cheerfully borne and ungrudgingly discharged, and of course; not a little ostentatiously at the same time. The manners of his constituency were robust and blunt, and great delicacy in his conduct towards them would have missed its aim, and he had no idea of reserve toward those who would bear the open utterance of everything that concerned them. It was, accordingly, not at all unusual, nor very outrageous, either, to find him enacting his benevolences in the public streets; nor, indeed, was it quite out of the way for him to rehearse them to the ungrateful and presumptuous, for their benefit and his own honor. In the centre square of the county town on a public day, with a crowd of the country people around him, he has been heard to say, more than once, in his loudest tones, "I'm the father of the County. For forty years I have done all its thinking, and managed all its business. I projected your public roads, and every great improvement in the policy of the community. I have made you happy at home and respected abroad. I know every man of you from the acorn up to the scrubs that ye are. I know more law than your lawyers, and more divinity than your preachers. I can teach your merchants in their own business; and there isn't one in a dozen of you that doesn't owe your good luck to my advice, and your misfortunes to neglecting it. I am the oldest Major General in the United States except General Jackson. I want nothing from you-I belong to myself; but I want you to know what is for your own good, percisely." 
                  In public debate and conversation he was remarkable for tact, blunt wit, and effective eloquence; besides, he had a voice and manner of declamation which insured the reception of any thing that he uttered. Not a man in a million has equal command of the nerves of his auditors. Think towards him as they might, they were obliged to think with him, and they were richly repaid for such submission by the temporary levelness of apprehension into which they were lifted by the casual communion. He was felt like magnetism while he stood near, and when he left, men looked at each other to recover themselves, and did or said something not true to assert their independence of him. His catch-words, and a laugh at his egotism, or an avenging thrust at his felt superiority, usually did the duty of saving appearances; but the consciousness, nevertheless, clung, and the effect remained. He did not hold his position in men's opinions on the terms that demagogues maintain their reputation with vulgar fools. He practiced no compliances, and flattered nobody. He was too strong, too honest, as well as too proud and unselfish, for the little arts of little men. 
                  His was a frank, confident style of eloquence, which had much more of the tone of authority than of appeal in it. It was intended to impart his own convictions in the directest way. The array of his argument was without any special adjustment to, or recognition of, adverse opinions; and he was much less given to that style of discussion which exhausts the subject, than to that other style which uses up the adversary. He had a close, strong grip of his conclusions; there was nothing wanting in the assurance with which he gave out his oracles, and, usually, nothing lacking in the acceptance they secured. He never knew the embarrassment of a doubt, and he never showed its hesitation. He wasn't loaded squib-fashion, with alternate wads of wet and dry powder. When he exploded an opinion, it had the clear, compact, metallic ring of a strait-cut rifle crack, and, hit or miss, it was not safe to stand within his range. 
                  It may have been his own innate clearness, or, it may have been his large experience, that taught him the common impertinency of debate, and led him to prefer the method of decision. However that may be, and however arrogant it may seem in the telling, it was not very much so in the act and fact. His auditors did not feel that they were slavishly surrendering their own judgment, but rather, that they had never seen the subject in that light, or felt it with the same force before. He never argued that a thing is so and so, because something else is so and so, which, in its turn, rests upon something beyond, which is so and so; but, that it is so, percisely, because it cannot be any other way; and so his argument stood like a house upon its own foundation, instead of a crazy hut, leaning every way upon props, reasonably strong, perhaps, but unreasonably numerous. 
                  If any one questions the safety of a logic so incautious, he has yet to learn the virtue which there is in a strong will and sound instincts in thinking, as well as in acting, upon the real affairs of life. It is not more the material of thought than the tightness of the twist which qualifies the thread of reasoning and gives it texture. There was nothing slack in warp or woof of the General's web. It had some kinds in it, but he dropped no stitches. He had learned all the best and most available law maxims; he knew the scriptures, as he said, like a book; and, he was richly supplied with those sententious oracles of wisdom and prudence which have crystallized themselves into happy, self-proving maxims, in form for ready and effective use. If he was not a scholar, and had not the depth and difficult exactitude of systematic learning, neither had he the narrowness incident to formal and special acquirement. If a scholar opened his budget before him, he knew how to select the goods from the trinkets and trumpery which mingled with them. He tried the worth by the use, and so derived all that had any utility for himself, and he declined the service of pack-horse for the balance. Things not clear were nothing to him, and sterling truths, ready for use and circulation, were as familiar to his ready apprehension at the first blush as if they had been old acquaintances. He would have found them for himself, by his own intuitions, when nothing else would answer; but if they were offered, he accepted them with the pleasure of present payment on a note not quite due, but, none the less, a real debt outstanding. His resources were those most available ones which any strong man can employ. They were found in the largest intercourse with the notabilities of the nation, a familiar and responsible communion with the live world around him, and an exhaustless stock of innate experiences growing out of his own wonderfully rich and varied nature. 
                  I am not attempting a biography, but presenting a character, by the method of description, rather than by instances, events, and actions. The actual outward life, in any case, does but little more than hint the constitution of the man. Especially where conditions restrain the play of extraordinary powers, narrative must fail to effect a fair presentment. Every incident of the General's life was full of him; but the historical detail would involve that of the times, his cotemporaries, and surroundings; besides, his report rests in oral tradition mainly. He died before the daguerreotype and daily papers undertook the hole-and-corner gossip of the country, and no phonographer ever caught the living likeness of his thoughts. His cotemporaries are nearly all gone, and very few of them fully apprehended him. He published nothing. His life got utterance only in voice and action. It was extemporized on the instant, and the data which remain to the chronicler are as meagre, confused and inadequate as the incidents of a battle, a storm, or a dance. I would gladly compromise for a fair report of one of his Fourth-of-July orations. It would relieve the awkwardness that there is in playing showman to the lion, and go far to supply the defects in my performance if such an auto-exhibition could be secured. I must even attempt to reconstruct one of those fossil curiosities from the fragmentary remains which lie scattered in my memory. 
                  The date is about twenty-five years ago; the scene was laid at the "Coffee Spring," a mile from our village; the company made up of the population of the town and neighborhood mustered en masse. The dinner, spread upon a table cast into a horse-shoe shape, in an arbor made with forks and poles, covered with bushes fresh cut and close piled to exclude the sun, has been discussed: the military, the citizens, and the boys-refreshed by the repast, and enlivened a little (more or less), with rye-whisky, whisky and water, whisky sweetened with sap-sugar, and small beer, graduated to the tastes and ages of the company-are all brought up standing, by an order for "attention" from the Captain of the "Independent Blues," and the General mounts the table. 
                  "Percisely, my fellow-citizens," (waving a red silk handkerchief at arm's-length,) "Percisely-as Brutus, fresh from the execution of the tyrant Csar, cried to his countrymen, 'hear me for my cause, and be silent that ye may hear;' so I come before you to speak the truth in the love of it. I stand here as Abraham, when he was returning from the slaughter of the Kings, stood at the feast which Melchisedek prepared for the grand old hero, to bless the name of the Most High, who hath delivered all mine enemies into my hand. 
                  "Chederlaomer and Julius Caesar, and that apostate democrat, Napoleon, all died in their sins, for their evil works went before them to judgment; Pontius Pilate cut his own throat, because he had condemned that Just One; Judas Iscariot hanged himself in remorse for betraying him; and George the Third, wilted away in his wickedness like that old pine-tree there, struck by the lightning of heaven-dead at the top, while the miserable old trunk still sticks in the earth by its roots. Honor to the race of regicides; destruction to the oppressors of the people everywhere; and a stout arm to match the bold heart of sound democracy all over the universe! 
                  "My dear fellows, you don't understand it; but it is as clear as light to the children of light, that the Lord reigneth and the devil's a fool. I know it; in threescore years and ten, I never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. Stretch yourselves up into the light; swell your breasts into the upper air. If you go nosing about in the dirt for a living, and dozing in the mud for enjoyment, the shadow of a leaf will hide the whole heaven from your sight. Pigs have no prospects. They grunt when they are comfortable, and squeal when they are hurt, but they don't understand the course of things. And if any fine fellow here feels his bristles rising, he knows who I mean by the parable, percisely. 
                  "My hairs are white, like the fields of Judea, ready for the harvest of the great reaper, and these shambling shanks are beginning to shrink from their duty; but, my soul laughs at the lengthening shadow of my years, let this crazy frame decay; I shall break out of it one of these days, like a sun-burst upon a mountain-top, when he comes out of his chamber in the east to run his glorious race around the arch of heaven. I am not old, and, when you bury my bones, remember that I am not dead. Peter was bewildered when he proposed to build tabernacles for Moses and Elias on the Mount of Transfiguration. When we have done our duty here we go up higher! When this frame has lost all its strength and beauty, the kindly mother-earth will sweeten and freshen it into youth again, and the limits of its life will widen into glorious liberty. Hallelujah! The light of these eyes is growing dim in the light of paradise! 
                  "Idiots and drivellers, from seventeen to seventy, think the world is coming to an end when worn-out frames and worn-out things are blown up: but such dotards are but first-cousins to the beast that perishes-all but the beauty. Such cattle have about the same right to scratch their heads, for any thing there is in them, as so many ring-tailed monkeys; and, very likely, will make as much by the operation. (Here, Bill, turn up a clean tumbler, and give me a drink of water.) 
                  "I was among these grand old hills, my sweet fellow-citizens, before the oldest of you were born; and, snipes and night-owls! did you ever detect any humbug in me? If you did, out with it. I'm so tired of barking that I would like a bite. Try your teeth in this tough old hide, ye whippersnappers. There's blood in me that would make you as drunk as blazes for the rest of your lives, and give you the first peep of glory that ever opened upon your benighted souls. 
                  "The follies of the dead are buried with them. They were not worth minding then nor remembering now; but didn't I tell your respectable daddies that they were making fools of themselves in the whisky insurrection? Blackguardism is not democracy! When Washington came to Bedford with the army, the Alleghany Mountain rocked under his footsteps, and the diminutive little manikins that danced like drunk monkeys around their pig-nut liberty-pole in the diamond over there, trembled in their shoes till you could hear their toe-nails jingle. I was a democrat, a Jeffersonian democrat then, as I am now; but I wasn't a demagogue, a coward, or a broad-mouthed brawler against my country, its laws and the constitution. 
                  "Your grandmothers can tell you what a rumpus the same ninnies raised around me for the first wagon-road made over the mountains to Pittsburgh. It would break up the pack-horse men, forsooth, and the tavern-keepers and horse-breeders would be ruined, when one wagon could carry as much salt, bar-iron and brandy from Baltimore as a whole caravan of half-starved mountain ponies! But I told them then, that, of all people in the world fools have the least sense, and that they would live to learn that the best way is as good as any; for, when I was but a boy I discovered that nothing less than too much is plenty, in the American meaning of the word. That's the difference between a man of faith and the snobs that do all their travelling in a treadmill. 
                  "But with such snipes nothing can be done. Cure them of witchcraft and they slide into fortune telling, or some other stupid kind of wonder working; for they understand nothing, either by insight or experience. After a while when the prosperity which they at first resisted poured down upon them from a spout, they went crazy, and I was mobbed again for standing by Simon Synder's veto of that batch of shin-plaster banks which the legislature chartered by a two-thirds vote, and gave you your keepsakes of Owl-creek and Mutton-town bills. And now, wheeling gee, as much too far as ye went haw before, you are bellowing at the top of your voice, and the end of your wits, against all bank paper! 
                  "Is it any wonder that I keep up my old grudge at the devil for making such people! Jack (to a darkie carter, occupied at the other end of the table upon the breast-bone of a turkey which he was polishing), you may as well quit beating and bothering your mules; make their breech-bands of sheet iron, and the traces of cob-web: for the more you wallop them, the more they won't go. My donkeys are of the same breed percisely, and they are all on a spree just now, kicking out their hoofs at free-masonry! That's the secret of all the villany and blundering in legislation, is it? Butter your brains and give them to the dogs for a New-Year's gift, and let somebody else do your thinking. Oh, it's enough to sicken a snipe to hear a twopenny pettifogger railing at the great men who have given us our free institutions, and built up this model republic into a world's wonder; and to see a herd of drivelling noodles drinking in his profanity like the words of life! But providence always had his hands full of such forlornities. If he can bear with them, I may. He will find the men somehow, when the time comes, to do up the world's work upon the principles of everlasting truth. The universal laws keep the earth in its orbit, and all the crawlers on its surface can't shake it out of shape, or turn it from its track. I believe and live. Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish. 
                  "And there is the common school system that I have been laboring for until it is at last fairly on foot. See that you keep it alive, and make it answer the glorious purpose of its establishment. Don't clip it down to nothing by your beggarly economy. I wish to the Lord that you understood thinking as well as you do eating, and could feel an empty head as painfully as an empty stomach. Can't you understand that keeping money in your pocket is not saving it? A dollar in a buckskin purse won't breed a sixpence in a hundred years; but employed wisely in the service of soul or body, it will bless the one and glorify the other. If you can't see the policy of education, make a religion of it. The world of ideas is the world of spirits. Introduce your children there, for every good thought is a guardian angel to the dear little lambs. And don't stop just where reading, writing and arithmetic can be worked into dollars and dimes. Carry them through and over this sordid world into God's world-up to the circle of the heavens, where He sits governing the universe by his laws. Every discovery in the truths of nature is so far into the counsel and confidence of the Supreme Ruler. Only the man that has the mind of God is Godlike. Now, for Heaven's sweet sake, educate your children. You may talk stupidities about the salaries of public officers, as you did against me for voting a gentlemanly per diem to the members of Congress; but don't cheapen your schoolmasters, till nobody but bankrupt cobblers, habitual drunkards, cripples, consumptives, and such other ugly incapables, can be got to serve you, for very shabbiness of the salary. Buy cheap store-goods, if you like, for when they wear out you will know it, and can replace them; buy cheap provisions, and eat the less of them; buy any thing cheap but cheap talents. Don't venture upon that speculation, for you are no judges of the article; and the only way for you to insure the excellence of the quality, is by the liberality of the premium mium which you will offer for it; that will bring the genuine into the market, and the bogus will be clearly exposed by the difference of the ring, weight and shine. 
                  "I go in ye see, for the arts of peace, the prosperity of the people, and all that blesses and embellishes the life of man; but I would not forget, on this great Sabbath-day of the nation, the glory our country has won in the field and on the wave. It isn't the pluck of the bull-dog or the gamecock in a soldier which I admire, but the high-souled heroism that chooses liberty above life, and knows how to make victory a blessing to the world. 
                  "In the Revolution, and in the late war against Great Britain we fought against foes who were, only a generation or two back, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh; born brothers, they were, of course, our equals in all qualities of manhood. They had the advantage in numbers, arms and all the appointments of war; but the strength of the cause was ours; we had the right, and the Lord of Hosts was with us. But, if we had been unworthy and incapable, if we had been poor in faith or feeling, poor in heart or hope, we would not have been elected to the office of banner-bearer in the army of universal freedom. The covenants of Heaven are made with faithful men; and a people that falls away from its worthiness is rejected at last, though still beloved for the fathers' sakes. While ye think ye stand, take heed lest ye fall. 
                  "This is a great country, and it isn't all fenced in yet. Very little of it, in fact, is so far finished as to be ready for the first coat of paint. All the wilderness of the new world is ours; for we alone can occupy it. The dwarfed provincialism north and south of us have no expansive growth in them. French and Spanish haven't the right kick in their gallop to match us in the race of empire. I have no contempt for any of God's creatures; they'll all weave into the web of existence somewhere, or they will do for selvedge and fringes; but showy and shabby is a bad mixture to make up by themselves. They are not of the right stripe for democrats; they don't come up to the full measure of the American pattern. 
                  "I tell ye, my dear fellows, we have had the wool pulled over our eyes by the European writers which we are all the time reading. Of course they know no better than to call Bonaparte a hero, and Wellington another for conquering him. That will do for t'other side of the water, for everything is great or small by comparison. But comparing themselves with themselves they are not wise; and they don't know enough to discern the true standard. Heaven help them to better doctrine and better diet. They will have such Generals as Washington and Jackson when they have the same occasion for them; and when they go to fighting for progress instead of power, and organize their civil institutions in the faith of the people's honesty and capacity for self-government, fully, fairly and faithfully, they may put their achievements down upon the page of history in parallel columns with ours. 
                  "Now, I have a few words to say that I don't want you to forget. Turnpikes, canals and railroads must be made, whether they run in front of your cabin doors or not. These mountains must be tunnelled; those valleys must be paved; must be, and will be. So, don't let any of those miserables who sometimes get themselves into your legislature set you against the necessity which is upon you; making fools of you, and scoundrels of themselves, by pretending that they will lighten your taxes and reduce the State debt. It is your opposition that will make your taxes heavier, and still will not prevent the inevitable march of public improvement. Support an enlightened system of public works, and choose honest and capable representatives-choose gentlemen, and give the snobs the cut direct. In the compromises, and accommodations of conflicting policies, which must take place at the seat of government, nothing will save a man but sound instincts and high personal qualities. For rough roads take a sure-footed nag, though he be a little headstrong and hard in the mouth. I never prophesied unto you smooth things, I never daubed you with untempered mortar, and I never betrayed your trust in half a century of public service. 
                  "Finally-until every man is as wise as his neighbor and as good as he ought to be, you must be governed by the majority, and that necessity will divide you into parties-two parties, mind ye, or one and a parcel of fragments. Now, the greatest of these will have the power in its hands, of course. How will you mend it when it goes wrong? By drawing off into as many little squads as there may happen to be differences of opinion amongst you! This will only strengthen the party that you are trying to control. The mountain springs refresh the lakes by flowing into them, not by running off into a multitude of puddles to stagnate in the sun! Parties must be built upon general views and broad policies. Organize as you may upon transient and trivial contingencies, it is all fuss and foolery. A party with anything positive in it will outlive its own abuses and your grumbling; or, if the real majority of the nation is too corrupt to purify itself, it will not be improved by changing its channel. The judgment day divides the world into two classes only-one right and one wrong. Do you think you can make a better or more accurate division? My dear fellow citizens, don't be caught starting aside after every vagabond fancy that inspired idiots can scare up. Within the proper party of truth and progress will be found all the available means of reform that political agencies can ever effect. Jonah withdrew in a fit of disgust because the Lord would not destroy Nineveh for its corruption, and sheltered his indignant head under a gourd that grew up in a single night, and, of course, perished in a night; whereupon he wished himself dead, and fainted outright. Better bear your small percentage of your neighbor's sins and blunders till they are cured, than curse the world and quit it in a passion. It is good enough for you to do your duty in, and too good to be condemned as long as it is getting better. 
                  "I'm done, for I don't jump off the stage or stump, like the pony in a travelling menagerie, through a blazing hoop; and I wouldn't whine a dying doxology to my speech if I knew that it was the last that I should ever make to you in the flesh. I will speak to you from my grave. My voice will echo from these hills, as long as the truth of my life is of any use to you, and you are worthy of it. Wherever I am-here among you, or there above you-I'll be doing my duty and minding my own business-Go home and mind yours." 
                  Saints and savages are much more simple compositions than the pivot-men of practical affairs; even the heroes and enthusiasts of most frequent occurrence in history are easily comprehended, for they are orderly and consistent in their movements, under the pressure of their singleness of impulse and steady concentrativeness of drift. A man governed by one monopolist passion, and devoted to one absorbing object, works in his vocation like a machine, and is no more a wonder or a puzzle than fire or water in their grandest style of operation; but those complex and intricate combinations of manhood whose elements are remarkable at once for their energy and divellent tendencies, like the multiform ingredients of vegetable and animal organisms, are as difficult of analysis as of integral activity and consistency. The faculties of such a man as General Ogle, each strong enough in its natural force, and all sufficiently varied and numerous, to furnish a dozen monomaniacs with extravagance, or a dozen heroes with inspiration, present a most difficult subject for speculation; and, when kept in constant effervescence by an active life, in a rude society, afford a mixture of results not easily reconciled. He is not to be measured by the standard of common lives, nor can his actions be safely resolved into examples for ordinary men's conduct. Things conformable and manageable enough in him would be monstrous in men of more partial make and with less balancing energy. Even in his best days, a strong impulse, aroused by a critical emergency, often ran beyond its proper limits and overleaped the boundaries of rule, so that nothing less than the reaction of his own great reserve forces might restore him to rectitude and order. At high tides in the current, in more than one instance, one or another of the provisions of the decalogue was temporarily submerged, and the trespasses of the Patriarchs and Prophets got an occasional rehearsal in the excesses and misadventures of his life.-And in the end, when age and circumstances conspired against him; when his natural strength abated, and his surroundings fell into general dislocation, his instincts and appetites, like the chemical forces which come into play as the vital energies decline, assumed the government, the strength of his nobler nature failed, and his sun sat under a cloud of darkness. 
                  At seventy-five years of age the coarse excitement and wild illusions of inebriety replaced the healthy activities which had been the very wine of life of his better says. The busiest occupation, the most perilous risks, the heaviest responsibilities, of his eventful experience, had never quite satisfied his great necessities; and now that the aching vacancy of leisure and enforced inaction had come before "the silver cord was loosed, or the golden bowl was broken, or the pitcher had broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern," he turned, by a sad necessity of such natures, to the delights of those passions whose indulgence remained possible, after his nobler faculties had lost their occasions and the power of exclusive occupation. 
                  The change was as rapid as it was terrible. I had seen him in the glory of his strength. I was a boy, indeed, and could not fully comprehend or estimate him; but a whole man is never wholly misunderstood even by the least capable observer; and if the impression was somewhat confused and indefinite, it was, nevertheless, grand and inspiring. He was a gentleman of the olden time, one of those demi-gods of the pioneer period of society that seem compounded of the savage and civilized epochs which they unite. He had outlived the fabulous era to which he appropriately belonged, and was as ill-assorted to the new times as the whole hero race of our idolatry would be if we had their personal presence now instead of their consecrated memories. 
                  A ruined tower is picturesque, for it had no sacredness, but a temple in decay is humiliating. It is the tomb of a god-the wreck of a religion-a worship in dishonor. When I met this man again after some years of absence from my mountain home, with my earliest apprehensions of him sharpened and heightened by the distance and difference of the common-place platitudes of fashionable life, and graced by those touchings of imagination which adorn our ideals and accommodate the object to the homage which we must give somewhere, to keep our faith alive and our souls in tone-when I met him again, bowed with years, in a sadly disordered dress, with a dimmed eye, unsteady limbs, untoned features, and nothing of himself left but his noble form of head and that erect hair, standing like a monument of the dilapidated man, I felt the contact like a blow. My habitual reverence groped for its object in that chaos like a child in a darkened chamber seeking for its father. Standing over his grave I could have recognised him. I could have found him all alive again in every street; and on my play grounds his presence would have answered to my apprehension, whereever I turned, if only he had not been there-there as he was. I could, I think, have borne the shock of all natural change. The even rush of years would have left some noble traces to adorn the ruin; a second childhood would have preserved some symmetry in decay; but, he remembered me, and had forgotten himself! Like the chieftain of a clan, he was naturally a foster-father to the children of his early friends. This, too, was extinguished. He had lost the habit of that respect, the consciousness of its mutual claims, and the sympathies and demeanor of the relation. 
                  Why does the church pray for deliverance from sudden death? The battle-field is the fittest death-bed of the soldier. When "it is finished," let the strong struggler give up the ghost, that the body may not become the grave of the soul, nor the holy ones see their own corruption. 
                  Before this strong man became incapable of active, useful life, his relations to it were divorced, and his great energies were left to prey upon themselves. He was not born to rust but to wear out; and when society refused his services and repelled his participation, the appetites, which had been suspended and controlled by half a century of intense engagement in worthy offices, resumed their importunities; the voices of youth displaced the proper dignities of age, and the offended witnesses of his fall lost their confidence in human virtue, by the shocking exhibition of its weakness. 
                  I did not reproach him for his infirmity. It was not his fault, but the fault of a wretched meagreness and meanness of conditions which could not hold such a mind and heart to their highest uses and noblest capabilities to the end. I date his death at the period of his discharge from public duty; there justice sets up his monument, and its broad shadow covers all that lies behind it. 
                
                
                   
                  ELIZABETH BARTON. 
                  I HAVE a story to tell, not to make. It is true to a thought-true as my senses received it into my feelings and reflections-and I am very sure that it has suffered no distortion or exaggeration there. 
                  The occurrences are now twenty years old; the locality is middle Pennsylvania, in a narrow valley, lying between two of the easternmost ridges of the Alleghany Mountains. 
                  I had just finished the usual term of medical study, and attended one course of lectures at Philadelphia. Of the experiences common to my tribe, I had my average-an exhausted purse, and a disappointment in a love affair. Under the compulsion of these, and the notion that a little practice of my own, with its attendant responsibilities (for which, I believe, I was better prepared than usual), would be fine training for my last session at the Medical College, I planted myself at a "+roads" in the centre of a good settlement. A grist mill, saw mill, distillery, smith shop, and retail variety store, did the business of the neighborhood; a weekly mail brought us our letters and newspapers; and I undertook the health of the vicinity, that is to say, of a region of hill, and valley forty miles in compass. 
                  A mile below us, on the stream that watered our pretty valley, there stood a long, low-roofed, rough-built, one-story stone house, which was called the "Union School house." Its primary use was for the instruction of the children of the district; but as it was the only public building in the neighborhood, it was used occasionally for all sorts of public meetings, and on Sundays regularly, under some tacit agreement, by half-a-dozen sects, for preaching and social worship. There, about noon on a summer Sabbath, might be found, at the time I speak of, the persons whom I wish to introduce to the reader's acquaintance; and, assuming that everybody knows enough of the general character of such audiences to answer our present purposes, I will content myself with describing particularly only three or four persons in the congregation, whom we are concerned to know more intimately. They are not the only noteworthy people of fifty or sixty present; for life is not so poor in variety and interest among our mountains, but I cannot pause in my narrative now to illuminate its margins with gratuitous portraiture. 
                  The clergyman is entitled to our first attention. This is the first year of his ministry. He is a stray slip of Virginia aristocracy, who has found scope for his enthusiasm of religious sentiment, and opportunity for his generosity of self-denial, in circuit preaching through a mountain range of three hundred miles' compass, which he must traverse once every month, preaching, on an average, "once every day and twice on Sundays." He is marked by better education, better manners, and more refinement than the men among whom he ministers; but he subdues his tastes and conforms his general demeanor to the coarse conditions of his work, with all the devotion, but happily, none of the pretence of a martyr. In good truth, he is very much out of place in this rude region, except for the rare spirits, one in a hundred or a thousand, who, perchance, may apprehend him. But he came among us in such singleness of heart and cordial devotedness of spirit, that he is as much disguised, to selfish and superficial people, as a prince in temporary banishment. And he would have it so, for he wants the discipline of such duty; and the concealment of his accustomed style of life is necessary to the free working of the experiment. 
                  The congregation felt that indefinable something in him which distinguishes the gentleman-bred, but missing all the pretence and mannerism, which, in their, idea, marked it, they generally accepted him at his own modest estimate, and the secret of his family and fortune escaped the gossips. He accepted his hundred dollars a year, made up by some thirty little congregations, as composedly as if he needed such a pittance, and he took the hospitalities of the circuit as contentedly as if their best was something quite agreeable to him. 
                  Not unfrequently the position of the preacher in this rugged region is a matter of ambitious aspiration, notwithstanding the rudeness of the people, and the hardness of the work; for some of our mountain, clergy are the coarsest men within the boundaries of the brotherhood; but often-very often-the service is a sacrifice of rich sensibilities and a dedication of fine talents to the most repugnant forms of duty. Such was the person, and such the attitude to his work, of our friend, the Rev. George Ashleigh. It were well for our new world if the ministerial office were generally filled by such men as he. 
                  Among the women belonging to this society there were two girls, whose characters were brought well enough to the surface by the events of my story to allow the hope of adequate presentment. 
                  Nancy Barton's general character was strength and style. Her religious impulses were very active, her social sentiments free and strong, and her selfish feelings, also, sharp and importunate. She was defective in imagination proper, but the life of passion warmed and strengthened her thoughts into grandeur, and her verbal eloquence was of the highest, tone conceivable in a woman destitute of literature and the culture of refined companionship. The custom of the church admitted of female participation in the public devotions, and Nancy found scope in a stormy eloquence of prayer and exhortation, for talents that had no match in such use within the circuit of a hundred miles. 
                  She was strongly, rather than handsomely, made. There was a firmness, weight, and force, with such elegance as belongs to them, in her make and manner, that kindled admiration, unmixed, however, with tenderness and affection. Her face, well fitted for the elocution of her strong thoughts and burning words, was strikingly brilliant, and even handsome enough, without being quite agreeable, or, in any fashion, fascinating. It turned, it may be, too fully and boldly to one's gaze; it confessed, perhaps, too much consciousness, and too much of the purpose of its own working, even in the rapture of its excitement; for there was a little of that system in its passion, which corresponded to the full elaborateness of her robust oratory. The trouble was, that, while her rhapsodies were in the vein of inspiration, the delivery intruded the feeling of much study and large practice with an aim. 
                  Nancy was an orphan, and dependent, for her support, upon her industry or the hospitality of her church friends, as she pleased to choose between those two sorts of reliances. She compromised and mixed them as her tastes and purposes required. She had made a long visit, the year before, to a distant town in one or other of these characters, and had returned with no slight advantage of travel and observation from the trip. A few weeks in the family of a lawyer, who had lately joined the church, put some polish upon Nancy's manner, and worked some notions into her understanding, which were not a little available, both for her private and public uses in our little valley. It was evident to me, at least, that it might somehow concern the young clergymen whom the fates should favor with appointments to this circuit for a year or two to come. It was, however, so obvious that Mr. Ashleigh was not a marrying man, that Nancy made no demonstrations in that direction, and, I believe, his general demeanor effectually protected him wherever he went from the usual liabilities of his exposed position. 
                  But now that Nancy has had her usual foreground privileges and preferences, and made her due impression upon the company; and after she has shaken hands with every body entitled to that ceremony before the congregation separates; and while she occupies Mr. Ashleigh with questions about the result of the last camp-meeting, followed by inquiries about the health of the most interesting members in the most fashionable parts of the circuit, and especially for the health of "Dear old Father Ball," the Presiding Elder, and of Brother Sanford, the eloquent young preacher, that is the present agony among church gossips,-all uttered in tones of unimpeachable meekness and pleasing melody, touched with the slight abstractedness of a devout spirit,-let me introduce you as well as I can to her cousin Elizabeth; whom Nancy's presence has covered and shadowed until the last moment for lingering has arrived, and the preacher and the old folks have moved decidedly for the door. 
                  Elizabeth Barton was something above the middle size, and might be taller still, with advantage, if her bearing had but a little pretty pride in it. She was finely formed, with such a mould of limb, and style of carriage, and rhythm of movement, as result from the best combination of strength and grace in form and arrangement, the best health and habits, and the best tone of mind and feeling, which the laws of correspondence can any way achieve in actual life. Her hand and foot, especially, were models, and her face, in everything but the consciousness of high mental power, was perfect in appropriate beauty. Her head had that symmetrical elegance that is never wanting in a fine character. Her complexion was rich and very pure, and the features regular and finished, but the forms and tints, though faultless, seemed subdued to the air of a hard service; and her dark chesnut hair, checked of its fullness and effect, was almost hidden from view by the severe restraint of its arrangement. My first sight of her was such a glimpse as I am now giving to the reader. I marked then the rich resources of physical beauty that lay covered there and unpronounced, the serious air of dedication to some onerous duty, and the deep religious renunciation of all the delights of sense and all the pride of life. She spoke modestly and kindly to those who were nearest to her, while she adjusted her bonnet and waited till the company gave her room to pass; and when she moved, it was remarkable for nothing so much as its quick directness and unobtrusiveness. She seemed to have no gossiping to do, and no time to spare, as she stepped rapidly from the door, and, turning the corner of the building, bent her course toward home. She had two miles to walk; most of it over a rugged ridge, which separated the little glen where she was born from the valley in which the Union Schoolhouse stood. It was, in fact, but a rift made in the hills by a watercourse, with a narrow border of arable soil, raggedly irregular; in spots affording room for a cottage, a little cornfield, a garden, and so much meadow as might feed a cow or two through the winter. Just where Tommy Barton lived, the rivulet was a little more liberal of margin and gave space within a mile for three other tenements; one occupied by Elizabeth's grandfather, another by her uncle, and a third by John Brown, who renders us the service of escorting our heroine across the ridge on bad nights, when she is obliged to be abroad; and occasionally performing other duties of kindness and courtesy, such as his supernumerary sort of; character owes to useful people in the world who are their nearest neighbours. By the way, this was the only noble office that the poor fellow ever filled, and we ought to be thankful that he was good enough and good-for-nothing enough, to be always ready for the duty. Brown, though a married man, of about fifty-five, is Elizabeth's only beau, but we may accompany her in imagination to her cottage home in the glen. The footpath lies straight up the hillside, leaving the winding wagon road abruptly and plunging directly into the thick bushes. A sharp struggle with the steepness, a brisk squabble with the loose stones which slip and tumble under the foothold, and we have gained the flat rock that caps the ascent. But it affords no outlook. The broad limbed chesnuts, scrub oaks, and undergrowth of bushes, hide everything but patches of the sky, and glimpses of the tree tops on the mountain range before us. Besides, we are on the way to Tommy Barton's, and there is nothing in our search that matches well with grand scenery and pretty landscapes. We must get down the rugged pathway, with our attention sharply employed upon our footsteps, and when the feat is well accomplished, we are on the margin of the little rivulet that unrolls like a silver ribbon between the hills. Stepping daintily upon the plank, that swings and dips till the surface of the water steadies it, we reach the worm fence of the little meadow, which is crossed by a stile, made rudely enough of an upping-block on one side, and a stump upon the other. The cabin sits fifty yards before us upon a natural terrace; a rocky bluff rises rapidly behind it, like a giant stairway to climb the mountain, which swells away into the mid-heaven, so steep and barren that it seems built there to dyke out the northern storm waves. This cabin is a rude, unshapely piece of architecture. Originally it was a square pen, built of unhewn logs, about a foot in diameter and twenty-five in length, but, as the necessity for room increased with an increasing family, additions, of similar log pens were piled up, at either end, until it stood stretched out in line; three houses made one by cutting out the end walls of the first one, and throwing all the rooms into one great hall, which, without partition, blinds or curtains to divide them, served for kitchen, dining room and bed chamber for the old folks, and cubbies for half-a-dozen of the young ones, besides room for a hand loom and its appurtenances, in the corner farthest from the kitchen end of the building. A half story above this long range of rooms, accessible by a ladder instead of stairway, with a clapboard roof for ceiling, and divided into rooms by drop curtains of heavy home made canvas, afforded the girls a dormitory at one end and the oldest boys a like accommodation at the other. The family, all told, reached the round number of fourteen children, of whom Elizabeth, the eldest, was about twenty-two, and the youngest child four years old at the date of our story. 
                  The mother was one of those indistinct nobodies who usually figure at the head of such a regiment of children, but the father was an Irishman, and had as much of that in him as would serve to "set up twice as many heirs," as the saying is, "in extravagance." He was one of the Bartons of the North, and according to his own account, "of a dacent family that lived on their own land at home, and niver a one of the name was iver known to be a Papist." Tommy's zeal for the true faith, it was easy enough to perceive, was the old grudge, and only another phase of his pride of caste and boast of blood. He was religious, of course, or he might as well have been born anywhere else as in the County Antrim. A dozen years before, he had been a member of the society that worshipped at the schoolhouse,-that sort of a member that can neither be kept in nor out of the Church but by the severest measures and the hardest fighting. Tommy left the brotherhood but two choices-either to put him out, or to blow themselves up. Accordingly, they expelled him on sundry charges, among which were hard swearing, occasional intoxication, and perpetual contumacy. The injury of this expulsion was nothing, in the account that Tommy opened with them for it; his pride fed fat upon his injuries; everything, everybody, injured him. In fact, he had all his consequence in his injuries. Their greatness served to measure the magnitude of his rights and were welcome to his magnanimity; but the insult was too much for one of the Barton family to bear. Tommy was eloquent by birthright, but, unhappily, be was never genial except when he was boring some gentleman in good broadcloth with the proofs and indications, historical and fanciful, of his family's gentility. Ill luck and ill treatment, ill conduct and ill conditions (Tommy never had any other sort of either) had curdled the wit and humour inherent in his blood, and kept it for ever boiling and bubbling with fretfulness and passion. Yet, queer, crazy, and absurd as was the mixture in this proud, weak, worthless, high-spirited old man, Elizabeth derived, it seems to me, her steady nobleness from his impulsive aspirations, her fine enthusiasm from his wild fire, and her generosity from his Irish pride. 
                  The chemistry of matter knows how to convert the elements of charcoal into diamond; and the modifying forces of the vital laws are equally adequate to all the difference between this foolish old father and his noble daughter. There was that in him which, by looking for it, one could see might, by better mingling and steadier drift, be made to answer, the best uses and highest ends; but, by an accident or jog in the settling, had produced instead-an Irishman,-which, I take it, as a rule, is nearer to a natural nobleman and yet further from a reasonable being than any other variety of the human race. 
                  The difference in results between these two persons was so great that they never actually touched, even at the borders; yet an intrinsic resemblance could be traced in every fibre of their respective constitutions. 
                  Tommy could get tipsy occasionally, talk nonsense mixed up with poetry any time, and brag like a jockey about everything that in any way concerned him. He was, moreover, incapable in business, unsteady in labor, and given to substitute the sentiment of duty for its practice, and to content himself with fine speeches in place of noble actions; and all without a shade of hypocrisy, for he was in fact so proud of what he was, and so ready with reasons and apologies for all that he was not, that he needed no pretences. He was not profligate, unprincipled, or insensible to right; he was only an Irishman; and that hindered him from being either worse or better. The raw elements of every human excellence were in him in rich abundance, and in great confusion too: but in Elizabeth they had crystallized into the most efficient forms and most perfect beauty; for all of texture that was wanting in her paternal blood was supplied to her by her maternal grandfather who was an unmitigated Scotchman. 
                  With his beggar's complement of children, and general unthriftiness of character, Tommy was, of course, poor to the very verge of destitution. He had grown steady-that is, sober-lately, and he was not lazy; but it was as much because his health had failed, and age was beginning to stiffen the machinery, as from any principle, that he was amending in his habits. It must be allowed, also, that he was feeling Elizabeth's influence with steadily increasing force. There was dignity with its incident authority in her deportment; not of the imposing kind, nor by any means directly and distinctly shown and felt; it was more like that energy of gentleness which shapes the bone to the brain's steady pressure, the framework of the chest to the resiliency of the lungs and heart, the vital power that in the tenderest flower stalk pierces and mellows to conformity the hardest clod. 
                  The very poor are unapt to respect each other, or to regard, amid the rude familiarities of their daily intercourse, the noblest qualities. Nor, indeed, is it easy for them to discover them in the coarse dress of circumstances which, poverty imposes. Ay! it is the bitterest of poverty's ten thousand curses, that it denies the conditions of decorous association and refining intercourse; that it prevents that discipline which habitual proprieties of demeanor only can enforce, and destroys all pure and healthful self-respect by the undignified and indelicate personal relations which it compels. And it is uttering a volume of commendation in a word, when I say that Elizabeth had conquered her father's refractoriness, and secured from him a deference which almost inverted the Irish order of domestic life. 
                  Five years before, when she attached herself to the church, the very church which had expelled him, he drove her with violence from the house, with as great indignation as if she had stained his name and honor with the deepest shame. A weary, wretched year she endured the exile, earning her support by labors, lighter, indeed, upon her hands than the tasks which she performed at home, but heavier upon her heart; for she could do nothing for that large family that needed her now every day, more and more, in every office which a woman only can fulfil to a household of small children in great need. The mother was what the country people called a "doless creature," and the sister next in age to Elizabeth was delicate in health and too feeble in character for the service. The weight that lay heaviest upon her heart was half a dozen of little sisters, as beautiful as birds, wanting all things; and wanting, most of all things, the governance and culture of an elder sister's nursing love and controlling prudence. They were crowded there together like a herd of orphans in an almshouse, exposed to their father's petulance and to each other's selfishness and tempers, and suffering many things besides, which childhood cannot suffer without having the very fountains of its life poisoned by the bitter deprivations; and all without the mediation of that wise, good heart which was aching in its exile to render its self-sacrificing services. There were frettings and fightings there, tears and turmoils, injuries inflicted and endured, and with all, and above all, the absence every hour felt, by the hourly recurring need, of the ministering angel of the household. Especially through the long, gloomy winter, the days, and weeks, and months wore wearily away in that wretched cabin. All suffered the penalty of the father's pride, but none so keenly as himself, for to him it brought all the privation, with the sin and folly added. But he would not yield to the constraint he felt and the necessities he witnessed, because it would have been in such circumstances, not a reconciliation, but a surrender; and, the refractory old fool would dash the tears out of his eyes, with the pretence that it was passion, and not sorrow that moved them, and with an oath refuse her permission to return. At last, when things had become intolerable, half a dozen children and the mother sick, the whole household suffering, and the father at his wit's end, she bravely forced her way into the wretched hovel. It required a little more resolution than the old man could muster to make resistance, and he silently and sullenly submitted. It was enough; she was installed again, and she had returned strong in purpose and very rich in resources for the exigency. 
                  A year's experience, a larger sphere of thought and broader observation, had done wonders upon her earnest character. It seemed natural enough that she should be a little strange for a few days after her return; moreover, she was still under ban, though the banishment was remitted; and these things together served to explain her difference of manner and general demeanor to her father and old familiars, and to protect her peculiarity from impertinent remark. 
                  She left them before her religious enthusiasm had time and opportunity to settle into form and take the habitual direction of her conduct. Residence among strangers, with its modicum of leisure and privacy, had invested her with her proper individualism; and the severe discipline of mind and feeling undergone, had worked its permanent results into the texture of her mental constitution, which was remarkable at once for its aptness and tenacity. The controlling quality of Elizabeth's mind was, very plainly, in its intense religious devotedness, which, in her not only sublimed, but strengthened her natural affections, held them well and wisely to their office, and gave to the simplest duty which had anything of sacrifice in it, the tone and determination of a sacred obligation. 
                  Her ideal of a religious life is called, in the phrase of her church creed, sanctification, perfect love, or Christian perfection. This conception was her standard. The instant aspirations of her heart were for angel purity and excellence. Her understanding, in its enthusiasm, rejected the logical manuvering by which the requirements of the highest law are reconciled to habitual delinquencies of life; nay, she felt weakness itself like a crime. Her meekness bore without apology the burden of her offences; and self-justification on the ground of natural infirmity of nature, would have felt to her the very boldness of an appeal from the law of conduct prescribed for her by her Divine Father. The soul held in such a frame, grew and gushed like the flowers and fountains under the kindliest influences of heaven. In the calm of her holy reveries, blessing lay like dew upon her affections, and in its exultant movement, the divine presence flooded her whole being with its light and life, like a sunburst on a mountain top. It needed only a clear insight to perceive that her essential life was "hid with Christ in God;" that there was a constant rapture in the soul under that tranquillity of the senses-a fullness of the diviner life sustaining a level of perpetual calmness on the surface, which the forces of the outward and accidental had no power to disturb. This supremacy of the central took nothing from the wonted energy of the loves she owed to the world without; it rather adjusted, steadied, and supplied them with a recreating strength, a constant freshness and untiring patience. If her faith and fervor bordered on fanaticism in sentiment, they nevertheless, in all the verities of use, flowed like life blood through her moral system, feeding with vital force all the faculties which perform the benign offices of love and duty. A deep peace ruled her spirit and wove its quiet into all the solicitudes which she sustained for others, and holy rest within compensated and repaired the waste of toil without. 
                  She held herself aloof from the coarse companionship around her without offence, for it was seen that she had no leisure for idle courtesies; and the restraints which occupation would not account for, were credited to her devotional habits. Besides, however strange it may seem, with all her dignity, beauty and efficiency, she was not especially attractive to the undiscerning boors about her. Her riddle was quite beyond their reading; and her charms were not in direct array to their apprehensions; for, in all its proportions, that saying of the apostle has accurate application, that "spiritual things are spiritually discerned," and not otherwise. She was quiet constitutionally, more so still by the high occupation of her thoughts; and she was, besides, really not eloquent in words, nor copiously furnished with thoughts and utterance for conversational uses. Her early education had been sadly neglected by that improvident father of hers; her present opportunities for study were absolutely nothing, and her mental activities were now, on account of their nature as well as of necessity, almost wholly introverted. Indeed, she was one of those instances of adequateness for the severest trials and highest duties, ay, for the nobles styles of life, where the intellect is only moderate, but the harmony and richness of the moral nature supplies it with inspiration, giving it range and strength and certitude, quite beyond its own independent capabilities. Three centuries ago, there were peers of England who could neither read nor write; and the highest fame in all the ample round of historic greatness belongs to a man, who, in speculative philosophy and general literature was neither proficient nor remarkable for his capability. 
                  Elizabeth knew everything that her life demanded, though she had learned so little. She could work miracles in the domestic economy of that burdensome household. She knew how to rule without usurpation, where authority rather required her to obey; and the younger inmates, refractory to all other force, yielded to the charm of her goodness and the mixture of gentleness, steadiness and address which she had the grace and patience to employ. A just analysis of her agency in that family would make an excellent treatise upon domestic conduct, though she would probably have been both silent and incapable in a discussion of the principles and policy of her system. 
                  Her mind and feelings, more than any other that I ever knew, found their manifestation in action, duty, practice; and less in utterance and social demonstration. Her reserve, indeed, seemed like an incapacity, and its rigidness scarcely escaped the censure of her kindest friends. Nothing could draw her from that everlasting loom except some household duty. No visit paid there seemed to include her in its courtesies or idleness. If a direct question interrupted the flying shuttle and her hand paused a moment in its office, it was only for the interval required by the shortest answer that could be made in kindness and cordiality. The thread of her web resumed its race as quickly as the urgency of the interrogation would allow, and her patience under persecuting complaisance was even equal to her perseverance; but, few as there were who understood it, or the proprieties which it exacted, there were still fewer who could raise the hardihood to test her forbearance very severely. Her steady manner settled it without appeal, for it really gave no offence and left no dissatisfaction. She was busy with a warrant, and the visitor always made her apology so as to leave the pleasure, of the call marred by no feeling but the sense of his own loss. 
                  I have seen but few women who sat as well at the piano, and when she had a fine linen web in the loom, and the weather allowed of open doors, clear air and summer neatness in the array of the cabin furniture, nothing could be more becoming than her occupation. 
                  It was not monotonous, for her face was full of thoughtful ful light and changeful feeling. Her perfect gracefulness of motion and simple elegance of form, her strength and quiet beauty, which, without challenging admiration, gave deep, pure pleasure, preserved an air of naturalness to the picture which allowed it to glide unquestioned into the spectator's feelings. 
                  Thus I found her and her surroundings when I called occasionally as a visitor; but, when I went professionally to see the children in their little illnesses, difficult as order was in such circumstances, the whole feeling of the scene was changed by the effect of her changed attitude. She stood foremost then, the mind that took direction of affairs; her manner intimating the highest qualities, and her whole action impressing me with the feeling, that she was my equal and something more, except in my professional office. In a thousand women I have met none whose mental sympathies and intuitions felt firmer and broader than did that rustic girl's. 
                  After a year's occasional intercourse, but more than occasional interest in her, the relentless severity of her toil and the unrelaxing strain of her mental excitation, conspiring with the recurrence of the epidemic season and an unusually wet autumn, broke down her strength, and I was summoned to her bedside, by her faithful old friend and servant, Brown, with a rap on the window of my shanty, I know not how long after midnight. 
                  "Doctor, you're wanted badly at Tommy Barton's. Elizabeth is down, I'm afeared with the fever; and she wouldn't let me trouble you till, I doubt, we've waited almost too long; but, I hope not." 
                  "Why Brown, is that you? Are you afoot? It must be pitch dark on the ridge just now." 
                   
                  "Yes; I had no horse; and I'd rather walk such a night as this than ride, anyhow. I don't know how you'll get along in the woods, Doctor!" 
                  "Don't bother your brains about that, Brown. Old Barney will find his way across the ridge for me, as soon as I turn him into the track, by the sense he has in his toenails, if it is as dark as Egypt. There is a good fire in my office; you can find a plank in the floor soft enough for you to sleep on, and you may eat my breakfast for me in the morning, and get home at your leisure by daylight." 
                  In ten minutes I was mounted, and Barney and I were swinging down the valley road, with such confidence and alacrity as nothing animal or human can feel, in the deep darkness of a starless night, except a country physician and his horse. But, I must not indulge in the rehearsal of a night ride along the mountain foot, the frequent fording of the valley stream, and the thick palpable blackness of the ridge before me. What of it? My faithful horse had the strength of a steam engine, and the elastic action of a leopard. Ah! we understood each other perfectly; and, while I adjusted myself in the saddle and he took in his first long breath to ease the girths and prepare for his first playful spring, I could feel that his heart swelled to welcome the sympathetic pressure of my knees. And when in the silence and vastness of the night I danced in the stirrups for very joy, the little difficulties and shadowy dangers of the pathway served only to frame in the dream, and define it into fact and give its enjoyment firmer reality and finer edgedness. Why, bless your cautious indolence, I was but twenty-two and had not lost a single patient in six months' full practice! I was in love with nature and all the world just then; for I had convalesced from my last attack, with the trouble all gone and the tenderness all left, sweet and fresh; and was just hovering on the verge of another and deeper passion, without exactly knowing or fearing it. So, hurrah for the night, the mountains, and the sky of heaven that I touch now in the vibrations of these stooping clouds! 
                  "Ho, Barney! step a little gingerly; my hat is down, but it wasn't your fault, my fine fellow; and that blow of the bough in the teeth closes the conversation with all out-of-doors for the rest of the ride." And so, settling into the proprieties of the occasion, I ride a little more warily and soon reach the rivulet, find a hitching-place for my horse near the stile, and the cabin door is reached with a spring or two by the light flashing from all its windows and showing the agitation of its inmates. 
                  Ay, fever it is, and a ferocious one. It has set in with such a storm of general disturbance, that my best judgment cannot predict the result. I see it all, all but the issue. A long, desperate struggle-weeks of battle between this vigorous life-force and the avenger of the much wronged organism. Elizabeth! the very glory of thy beauty is upon thee now. Smitten, as the swooping mountain wind dashes down upon a sleeping valley lake, arousing its billows into answering madness; and with the terrors of the storm, too, this liberated life has come; for there is desolation in the wake of all its grand commotion! Dreary, dismal, chill and hopeless, the winter that may follow; and the flowers of the coming spring-how sad, in their fresh gaiety, will they bloom to me, if they shed their sweetness on thy grave! 
                  Such were my sensations under the first shock of the threatening symptoms. The flushed cheek and flashing eye; the nervous energy, bordering upon delirium; the throbbing, wiry pulse and burning heat, crisping over all that snowy purity of complexion-all these arrayed against the roused resistance of that noble constitution-unfolded like a battlechart chart to my startled apprehension. And the grouping of the anxious family, which always has its force in medical prognosis; the father, with his look of fear and helplessness, breaking into tears and tenderness, so unusual with him; the mother, looking that complete break-down wretchedness which she felt; Mary, busying herself with nursing duties, which she is inventing to crowd out the thickening thoughts of danger; and the children, with eager alarm in their little faces, peeping from under cover in every corner that could command my countenance, to read their hopes and fears in its expression! How electrical the focus of such burning eyes, the centre of such whirling thoughts, becomes! and how much depends, to the patient, family and physician upon the impressions of that first fronting with the malady! Its intensity must be broken by a movement of professional authority, and hearts get relief in the activity of the hands, or mischief will follow that cannot be repaired. 
                  "Bring me some water, Mary, fresh from the spring-a large bowl full and a thick towel for her pillow. We must sponge her head and hands till the excessive heat is well reduced; and, Mary, bring her a tumbler, lipping full, to drink, too." 
                  "Oh, thank you, bless you, Doctor; I'm burning with this thirst and fever! All day long the water in the spring-run has been rippling just beyond my reach-the sound of its dropping falls like blows upon my ear; it boils upon my hot tongue, and the steam of it fills and seethes my very brain. It runs away between my spread fingers when I try to dip it up, and it bursts out into flame as soon as it touches my hot lips. Oh, give me some cool, fresh, sweet water, and let me rest, for I'm so weary; and-and-I have so much to do when I waken." 
                  "The trouble on her mind is for us, as it always is," groaned out the father; "and she's just killed with labor, I wish it was myself that was lying there, and as well prepared, for I'm no use now, and she'll be hard to spare in this desolate family. She has kept us together with hard struggling, many a long day, and I thought she would be spared to us and then we would hardly want anything else in life. Must we lose her, Doctor, dear, do you think?" 
                  "Lose her! No, it is not possible. It is not in the harmony of things. We love her as well, and need her more than the angels do; and we'll hold her here with a heart-strength that will not fail us. Fear nothing, believe and wait." 
                  My own prophecy did but little to assure me; but fear answered as well when hope failed, and without bating a jot of effort I gave her such skill of medicine and nursing as head and heart could furnish for nineteen days and nights; doing double duty with half rest, in order to distribute even justice to my other patients, and watch for the changes that I feared in her case. How still my heart stood at that cottage door-step, when I made my visits in the night, while I paused to catch by the well-known signs of the sick room, how the patient was supposed to be by her attendants, before the courage could be summoned to meet the facts in all their certainty. And when, day after day, the same changeless stupor hung upon her brain, the same hot pestilence rioted through her frame, till she lay a wreck upon the fever surges that were slowly wasting her,-oh, what questionings of my own competency, what doubtfulness of my profession's truth and usefulness, what prayer and wrestling with the Power that held the issues of life, for deliverance from the impending danger! 
                  At last, one fine November morning, when faith and hope, and even affection, had worn weak by their own exhausting tension, and the suspense, grown into a habit, held our hearts in a mechanical, steady stupor, suddenly the clouds broke, and the heavens and earth smiled out with joy again, like the waking of a summer morning after rain. The crisis was past, and she was given back to us, and we sat down together like children, and played with our recovered blessing, as with a new toy given by a loving parent on the morning of a holiday. 
                  Critical illnesses often work other changes in the patient besides the various physical phases of their progress-changes that become permanent in the habits of feeling and character of thought. These discovered themselves in Elizabeth during her convalescence by a happy consciousness of all the interest that we felt, and a gaily frank acceptance of the services which we rendered her. No weight of work and duty lay heavy upon her heart now, and her affections flowed out rich, genial and generous, without check or censure from an over severe sanctity of spirit. Affectionate tenderness, flowing in upon her for the first time in her hard life, had its natural effect; her mental tension and strictly ruled emotions lost their strained resistance under the influx of loving kindness. The rigid habitude of devotedness and self-sacrifice was relaxed by bodily feebleness, and her long checked affections opened broad and bright, like the flowers of a late spring in the first full flood of sunshine. 
                  It was about the third day after the happy turn, when the hope of her recovery felt well assured, that I was first impressed with these thoughts about her. Mary had succeeded in thoroughly dressing her luxuriant hair; the bed, made up in the tone of the new hopefulness, was snowy white in its array of fine domestic linen, manufactured by Elizabeth's own hands the year before; and a pink gingham bed-gown, which I recognized as an old acquaintance doing a new duty, lent its delicately relieving tints to the exquisite fairness and fineness of her pure complexion, still too pale from her recent illness. The windows were open to the genial air, the sunlight lay mellow upon her pillow, and a smile of holy sweetness played upon her face. We stood in the conscious communion of her inmost life, and saw the real as in a vision, and felt the true as it were a dream. The imagination had there materials for its brightest fantasies; but there was a soul within, and a simplicity of fact beneath this transfigured life, that might stand the ordeal of the hardest baked philosophy. I marked the fact that she had now first awakened to the full consciousness of her own loveliness. Its proper joy gave light to her eye and its melody to her voice that morning, just as the breezes, birds and rivulets breathed, and sang, and smiled out the gladness and glory of their own beauty. The severe restraints of her girlhood, which had garnered while they repressed her life's natural outflow, now gave way under the new impulse. The reverent tenderness of those whom she most loved had found occasion in her illness for such manifestation, that she could feel, without the abatement of self-reproof, her own real worth and a divine blessing in the sense of it. It rested like a crown upon her natural nobleness, converting that cottage into a very presence-chamber, and the bed and beauty which rested on it seemed an altar with its angel. It came to me like a religion and lent a lasting beauty to my life-an abiding sense of the sacredness of pure womanhood. 
                  That winter I had devoted to the completion of my collegiate term of study. Three precious weeks of the session had gone by while I lingered with Elizabeth; for I could not leave her till her health was certainly restablished; and I may, perhaps, as well confess that I was in no special hurry to take my own discharge. After all, it was only one of the professors whom I cared very much about losing for the first month of the course, and so I took a little more time than in strictness might have sufficed for preparation for departure. 
                  Returning from the County town one evening, two days before the morning fixed for leaving for the city, a furious storm of wind and rain drove me for shelter into the farmhouse of a friend and sometime patient, where I was delighted to find the Rev. Mr. Ashleigh staying for the night. He had been absent from the circuit for a month or more, on a visit home. His brother had died, and left him guardian of two young children, whose care had a little while detained him. His greetings were unusually earnest and impressive; they made me know that he had something to say to me in trust, or that I could do something for him. We had not been friends before, exactly, but near enough to it to become so through the sympathies of the first scrape that either of us might fall into. A private interview was impossible, for the rain kept us in the house, and the family wouldn't miss a word of the conversation of the Preacher and Doctor, or leave us a moment alone, for the world. They were too polite and respectful for that! And as it rained on severely till nearly bedtime I agreed to stay with them. 
                  That night we occupied the same bed. Two hours, full, he talked, as I felt, about every thing but the matter on hand, until I grew weary, and withal solicitous to know what exactly was the matter with the fellow. At midnight the sky cleared and a bright moon burst gloriously out; its light fell full upon my face through the window; I marked it, and turning toward him, jocularly said: 
                  "Brother George, did you ever walk out alone, on a fine night, to talk to the moon, and when you met her face to face, didn't know what to say to her, eh?" 
                  His whole manner changed; his fine face filled full of high emotion; he rose upon one elbow and laid his other hand upon my heart, thrilling with the appealing meaning of its touch, and looking steadily and largely into my eyes, he said, slowly and impressively: 
                  "Doctor, do you know Elizabeth Barton?" 
                  His look held the question where his words had put it, with such impressment, that I lay still under its imposing earnestness till it was hard to make my answer fittingly. My mind manuvered for a moment or two for an escape, but it wouldn't do; "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth" was the demand, and in all plainness it rose spontaneously, and I could only touch it as it passed my lips, with a relieving shade of humor. 
                  "Know her! my dear fellow, know her! why, I don't know anybody else." 
                  He fell back upon his pillow, as if he had fainted. This brought me to my elbow, to gaze in turn into his face. He hid it with his hand and whispered slowly: "Wait a moment and I'll tell you." 
                  "That's you," said I; "Unbuckle your budget freely, and let me look over your assortment. I'm ready for anything that you have on hand; especially, anything about Elizabeth." 
                  My gaiety relieved him; and rising again, quite as earnest, but not quite so awful as before, he said in tones as mellow as pity for himself could make them, 
                  "Doctor, I love that girl to desperation." 
                  "Whew! whew!" 
                  "Hear me, Doctor, do hear me; I know what I'm saying. It is true as heaven, it is the only live truth left in me. I love her as never man loved a woman before. What shall I do?" 
                  "Do-do-you superlative simpleton! why, get up this moment, go saddle your horse, gallop over the ridge, kick the door down, throw yourself at her feet, tell her you LOVE her, with your face set to the same expression that you have told me: and if she don't accept you on the spot, take your boarding, or fall sick and stay till she does. Now my poor fellow, lie down and take a good cry, and you'll feel better. I'll sit up with you till the crisis is past. There-there-on your own side, please! you're smothering me! and more than that, Toby Myers will hear you bawling out; I heard him turn in his bed just now; he'll be up here directly, if you don't behave, and then I'll have to tell some capital lie for you, about the nightmare, to account for this blubbering. Come, do behave yourself, will you?" 
                  In a few moments he reined up and carried himself steadily, and then he told me how he had been impressed by his first sight of her; how he kept thinking about it; how he preached an entire sermon to her, soon afterwards, and how, after a little while, he could scarcely preach at all, because she was present with her earnest eyes fixed so steadily and coolly on him; how he called as often as he could invent occasions at her father's; and how incessantly that everlasting loom went on with its work; how many efforts he had made to gain some conversation with her; and how completely he was always baffled by her busy occupation, and her reserved demeanor, until he felt worried out of his life with disappointment and uncertainty. 
                  "Uncertainty," said I, "what about?" 
                  "What about!" he answered sharply, almost angrily; "what about! why, Doctor, what do I know about her? Can she read and write? I'm hardly sure that she can talk. Do you know that I am a gentleman; or must I tell you? And more than that, I am not quite a fool either. My family is fashionable; I am wealthy,-and I cannot marry an uneducated wife,-a woman that I must blush for, till I grow ashamed even to love her. Oh Lord! what shall I do?" 
                  "Do! I'll tell you what to do. Just hold your tongue till you hear me, and then hold it afterwards till you tell your story to Elizabeth and hear what she has to say: for you have not wit enough now to take care of yourself." 
                  "That's not very hard to say, I reckon, for it hasn't to be felt first," was his reply. Then pausing for five minutes, he added slowly, and as he thought, very resolutely, "I'll do nothing more about it. I must go home again in January to attend to business, and (here he drew the clothes tight about his shoulders like a man determined to sleep) I'll not be sent back to this penitentiary circuit again, I suppose; so, if I can forget her, she is dropt, that's all. But, if the good Lord thinks otherwise, why, I suppose it will be brought about somehow. Let me see-you start for the city in a day or two. Of course, you think it safe to leave her. And, maybe I shall never see either of you again. God bless you, Doctor, I'm glad and thankful that you are her friend." 
                  Another long silence, and he turned up upon his elbow again. "See here, my dear brother Doctor: you are in love with Miss M. Now, I don't ask your confidence-I don't want it; but tell me just one thing. If you marry Miss M., and I were to marry Elizabeth, would your wife visit mine, there in that old cabin, among those looms and pots and rickety old chairs, and, I don't know what all?" 
                  This brought me to my elbow decidedly; and, thrusting him down upon his pillow, and laying my shut fist upon his breast, instead of an oath, I answered him with a ring of the real metal of my meaning in every word: "If she wouldn't, she shouldn't live with me, that's all;-so please don't make a special fool of yourself." 
                  The poor fellow's eye moistened, his face softened into a happy smile, and laying his open palms upon my temples, he whispered "The good Lord bless you;" detaining every word as it passed his lips, to give it all the earnest tenderness that was welling up from his full heart. 
                  The next morning, I inferred that he had slept as I did; he looked so fresh and happy. I waited for breakfast for the sake of his company homeward, and I noticed that Mrs. Myers mellowed her voice and looked more womanly than usual when she spoke to him at the table. Something had turned up within him that telegraphed itself to her instincts, and made him beautiful exceedingly that morning. I knew it,-he had got his own consent, and given free wing to his idolatry; he had, in a sense committed himself to Elizabeth by opening his heart to her friend, and the poor fellow of yesterday was rich now in the unchecked overflowing of his own soul. 
                  But, wasn't I fidgety and foolish; didn't I almost tell something that nobody could understand, when next day I visited Elizabeth? Wasn't I provoked that she wouldn't know she was queen of a new found world, and wouldn't echo all my exultations about-nothing at all, when it came to be stated in clear terms? And didn't I nearly swear her to a promise not to work that winter in my absence, but read and write, and visit my sweetheart and her friends; and get well and strong against the next spring, when I should return to set her free from my authority? Moreover, wasn't I so glad of everything, and so full of robust rejoicing that I rudely stole a kiss, and felt particularly awkward when I discovered that I could have had it willingly, and that much the better, in the presence of the whole world? And-and-then I turned away as a tear of gratitude and blessing glistened in her eye, blurring the last look she should have of me for many months, with all the shadow of life's risks thrown over the prospective absence. I had my reward; I was paid for all that I had done and suffered in one moment-I stood clear in the apprehension of one pure, noble soul; the angel-life within me was stirred and realized in her recognition, and I knew again that the divine is true, and that the highest and brightest is the most real. But the conditions of the outward life were upon me; devotional joy quickly resolved itself into gladness of nerve and heart, and Barney wondered what was the matter with me, I thought, by his plunging and blowing before he had climbed to the top of the rough ridge. By the time he got into my secret, as usual, I was quiet, and rational, and orderly again. A horse may bear a burden that will lift his service into the fellowship of a grateful sympathy. Poor fellow, he soothed me in many a moody hour; he understood me,-and I love his memory now. 
                  By this time my readers are beginning to like me, I fear, and in that proportion, to withdraw their interest from the principals of my story. I will indulge the generous sentiment with a word only. My letters came to me during the session to the very hour. I found them every Saturday morning upon my plate at the breakfast table, where my good old landlady persisted in placing them, to have the pleasure of the explosion, which I could not learn to master when I found them with the right post-mark and image on the seal. So the studies at the college and the pretty girls at my boarding house did me no mischief, and I got along like a young bear, or a man with a wheelbarrow-my troubles all before me. The winter was a severe one, the snows deep, and the roads in the valley desperate; and I heard scarcely anything about Elizabeth except that she was "doing well." 
                   
                  Of all the days in the year, it was St. Patrick's day in the morning that I was awakened from the absorption of my own affairs to a renewed interest in the events of my story, by receiving a brief note from Elizabeth, inviting me to her wedding, and conveying Mr. Ashleigh's request that I would stand groomsman for him with my own sweetheart, who was to play bridesmaid to her. This was all tempting enough, but the session had not closed and it was impossible. I was obliged to do as the courtly Mr. Dapper did, when it suited his business to leave church before the service had commenced,-send my "card with regrets" to the altar.
                   
                  The day after I arrived at home, I crossed the ridge by the old route to see the "new married pair." It may seem odd, but the thing did not feel quite so like a romance, now that it was settled and consummated, as it did the last time I travelled that same road. It was all over, like a ball or a battle, and the hopes and anxieties so interesting while the plot was opening, were replaced now by those common-place certainties, which belong alike to all new marriages, sharpened and deepened, indeed, in this case, by the speculations of curiosity and the feelings of friendship which specially belonged to it. 
                  How it had been brought about was yet a secret to me: but the route has usually lost its chief interest by the time the rendezvous is reached. This feeling came down upon me like mountain mist as I crossed the hill again, in circumstances so much altered to all the parties involved in my story; and when I met the happy couple in the cabin, with all its furniture and conditions, and their own manner and relations, changed so greatly for the better; and, especially Elizabeth, in a new attitude which severed the old relations and broke up the dependence upon myself, which had grown so familiar to me and so pleasant, I confess, my enthusiasm flattened out a little. There she was before me in full health, her face more beautiful even than ever, but of a different style of beauty; her rich chesnut hair had been shorn in her convalescence to prevent its loss, and was now confined by a cap that helped to mark the transition from the rustic maiden to the married lady, with the most exquisite grace and fullness. Her new character, with all its claims finely asserted, sat upon her as easy as if she had been "to the manner born;" and I felt the improvement, but I felt the difference, too, and I believe I checked my first greeting in mid-volley and changed it somewhat sharply into the proprieties of the new order of affairs. Instead of the capers and confidences that I had promised myself in the consummation, we conversed and then dined, actually dined, in that same old cabin, in a way that I thought none of us were exactly accustomed to. The fashion of it wasn't Philadelphia, nor was it Virginia, and I'm sure it was not any nearer Tommy Barton's style than it was to either of the others. It was a sort of compromise of the three, and so an immense improvement upon the past, but without its natural relish. I didn't quite want the old order restored again, but-I missed it. 
                  Could I have been a little mean and selfish, because, with all my real generosity, it was very pleasant to play patron to a very pretty girl,-because my occupation, with its pride and circumstance, was, like Othello's, gone-and, because, I was now of no real consequence to anybody there, and had only to be thanked and discharged from office, and, maybe, patronized besides, at the next turn affairs might take in our respective fortunes? Heigh-ho! it really is more blessed to give than to receive; and, to be drifted into an eddy while the current that we rode so grandly on drifts by without us, makes it a little difficult to be liberal in sympathy with the dashing waves that leave us by the way. 
                   
                  Mr. Ashleigh had been married almost a month, and he looked already as if it were quite a settled matter with him. He spoke to his wife as politely as if thirteen children, a couple of old folks, and a young gentleman with a sharp eye in his head, were not to be taken deep into the connubial confidences. I thought he did not fully believe in my profound respect for everybody and everything that surrounded him, and I was for a moment shabby enough to hope it was nothing worse even than that. But no matter-I had business over the ridge a little earlier and more urgent than I had thought of until now, and was about shaking hands respectfully, when Elizabeth, the Elizabeth of my memory, peeped out of the new Mrs. Ashleigh and asked me for a word in private. I gave her my hand,-we walked to the spring-head, a few paces from the house, and quickly found ourselves all right again. 
                  Turning to me, she said, "Doctor, I owe you, along with other things, a bill for medical attendance." 
                  "If you do, Elizabeth, you will have to owe it, along with the other things, and pay it in the same way." 
                  "I'm glad and thankful to have it so," she answered, in a manner full of beauty; "I do not wish to owe you less, to take one grain's weight of my debt from my memory or affections, but I thought it due to Mr. Ashleigh to renew it in his name if you would not let me pay it. We will be separated soon; we may never meet again, and I wish all your recollections of me to be happy as they can be; and I cheerfully remain your debtor that the clink of money may not seem to cancel any bond between us. God bless you, Doctor!" 
                  She took my hand and stood for a moment in rapt devotion, as I had seen her before under trials and in triumphs, and I felt its influence,-its hallowing influence,-like a new baptism. Then changing her whole manner, she said lightly, "Doctor, I'm very happy-it is all right,-I have not a word to say that you need to know. Your warmest wishes for me are more than fulfilled; be sure of this. But, did you know that Cousin Nancy was not at our wedding?" 
                  "No." 
                  "You must ask my husband for the reason. He will tell you-I cannot. There he is getting out his horse to go with you, I suppose. What a talk you will have! I shall be along with you, in fancy, and overhear every word. Oh! I wouldn't miss your part of it for the world; especially, the sight of your face, which I shall have by my own insight, in a place or two in the story that I know of. Good-bye. You will be with us to-morrow. We dine with Miss M-." 
                  We were scarcely mounted when Ashleigh looked at me just as he did on the morning after our moonlight bed scene. Like his wife, he thought and felt much more than his face usually confessed, and, like her, when his heart opened, the revealment was full and absolute. The road was narrow; but we did not want a wide one. He seized my hand and gave me a look that began with a pleasant, cunning, self-congratulating meaning, which soon sobered down into deeply earnest feeling, then rose again into the tone of a gay triumph, and burst out finally into laughter which set every never in his body to dancing in its own gladness. 
                  There needed no introduction and there was no danger of impertinences in his story. He began naturally, just where I left him, and went on, only lightly now and gaily, with his difficulty of getting access to his sweetheart's presence. He tried every way but the right one, until, when there was no other left, he discovered that, and then his troubles were well over. He asked her to walk with him up the valley, having something to communicate, he said, which greatly concerned himself; and they were immediately on their way and out of earshot of all the world. He had learned the necessity of directness by the failure of all his little dodges, and he had crossed the Rubicon himself, and felt the over-ness of his position. His words were few but full. They needed no explanation, and they left no doubts. And when he had opened his heart, and emptied it utterly before her, he turned, and asked her if she could love him. She answered him with equal candor and directness: "Mr. Ashleigh, I do not love you. I have never thought of such a thing. I have esteemed you as a preacher; and, as a man, too, when that point has presented itself, I have sufficiently admired you; but I saw you were a man of good birth and gentle breeding, good talents and education, with the world open to you, by virtue of your social position, and, perhaps, wealth; for even the signs of that were not all concealed under your careful modesty of manner. Am I right about your circumstances?" said she, pausing for a reply. 
                  "Yes, Elizabeth," he answered, "I am what you would call rich." 
                  "Well," she resumed, "I knew all this; and, if I had thought of giving you any other regards than such as became our church connection, the improbabilities would have checked me; but I did not. Mr. Ashleigh (reaching out her hand to him), I tell you truly, that I do not love you. It is a new feeling to me. Perhaps I do not very well understand it; nor will you expect it to come like a ready answer to a short question." 
                  "Good! Good!" I shouted. "What a glorious girl! What a world of genius in her simple truthfulness! What did you say to that, Ashleigh?" 
                  "Say to it? just hold still and you shall hear. Of course, you can't guess; for you didn't see her face, at that moment, nor read its meaning, as I did. Ah, my dear Doctor! it was worth living all one's lifetime and a better life than mine, to witness that transfiguration of perfect womanhood! I wonder if she is not sometimes literally inspired! 'Well,' I answered: 'you do not love me, Elizabeth, but could you not?' I waited long enough to read it all in her face, and then it came in words. 
                  "'Mr. Ashleigh, it is in my heart to love you, for you are very noble, as this world goes, more than noble, generous, without a parallel. And, sir, I am what I am; not unworthy of the love you offer me, nor incapable of returning it. I can marry you without a fear. Now, leave me, please; I wish to be alone.' 
                  "And so did I," he added, musingly; "it seemed as if eternity had opened to me; and I wanted to be alone in the universe with my emotions." 
                  A long pause followed, which I felt, for his hand, and eye and voice helped me to understand it. He resumed:-"Enough of that. You understand it, or will, when you get big enough. We have reached the spot in the road which I wish you to mark particularly, for it concerns yourself more than anybody else, I believe." 
                  Here he dropped my hand, which he had held all the way up the ridge, and stiffened himself upon his stirrups, his whip whistled as it cut the air, and the whole man was keyed up as tensely as the texture would bear. 
                  "You recollect," he began, "our talk that night at Toby Myers's. Well, whether our friend Nancy got it in gossip there, or guessed her way to all she discovered, I don't know; but it was not long after I knew my own secret that she had it very fully. Of course, she noticed my visits to the glen, and I had paid but few of them, after my return from home in February, till she knew all they meant. One day I was coming over and she knew it, and contrived to have me overtake her near the top of the hill. Supposing that she was coming to her uncle's, I, of course, dismounted, and, leading my horse by the bridle, walked beside her. I didn't like her, and I didn't like that she should be in my road where I was going either; but I must be polite and bear it. 
                  "We walked on, I in the mood that you may guess, and she occupied and agitated in a fashion that was decidedly alarming. Her manner was more than usually impressive, touched with a little more of that soft seductiveness which coarse people use to humbug verdant ones, than was common with her. Sometimes she fell suddenly silent, with an air of troubled abstractedness, from which she would rouse herself with a sort of impassioned recklessness, which would soon give place again to a turn of tenderness, that, altogether, made an object of me, and shook my nerves into a state that put me at her mercy. 
                  "When she talked, it was in her style of glowing eloquence, with, I thought, increased concentrativeness of conception and utterance. She was, in short, inspired with a strong purpose, and I caught it by contagion. I didn't know what it meant, nor whither tending; but I was feeling and believing something great or terrible in advance, and was prepared for the fact or fancy, when it should come. 
                  "When we reached the spot I bade you notice, I was electrified to the right point and she knew it. She stopped suddenly, and turned full upon me, looking, I confess, grandly,-a little too grandly, to be sure,-but still it overcame me. Besides, she had taken advantage of the ground, and so had me in all respects just right for her purposes. 
                  "'Brother Ashleigh,' said she, with a measured earnestness that made my heart beat, 'you love Elizabeth. I know it; nor do I wonder that it is so. She is an angel of beauty and goodness. I know her, as her cousin, her playmate, her friend and sister. I know her, as a woman only can know another; and I declare to you that I never knew her equal in every excellence of heart and life. Her childhood was purer, I believe, than any other's, and she has lived a sinless life, if ever human soul did. Oh! she has borne the selfishness, the very sins of other's like a saint,-she has borne mine, till I feel humbled before her. And if she had but an equal intellect, an equal sharpness and strength of understanding for her own defence, she would be the very paragon of the world; and, alas! would be as happy now as she is good and beautiful.' 
                  "Here she stopped, and looked me so pityingly in the face that I held my breath with fear. She saw it; and clasping her hands upon her bosom, she turned her face toward heaven, with all her passions working into prayer in it, till it grew grand and almost beautiful. I see her face now; I could paint it at a dash, if I were a painter; I could stick it in the mist here as plain and palpable as life. Wherever I look, I see it; it repeats itself, like masks in a fancy dance, wherever my eye turns. The pearly tear that glistens so gracefully in her eye was upon duty, looking like a great rain-drop upon a leaf, with the sun blazing on it,-all but the innocency. An impressive moment she stood, wrapt in a seeming agony of supplication, then her face came down again from its high pitch to the tone of pity. She hesitated-admirably the hesitation was done; she trembled-the saint sank in the woman-she bent her head upon my shoulder, and sobbed out till I shuddered. Then she roused herself, dashed the tears out of her eyes, and spoke quick, and almost passionately:- 
                  "Brother Ashleigh, the Doctor urged this engagement; he used all his art of persuasion, all his power, upon your noble confidence; and he abused your trust. While he seemed only to answer your wishes, he in fact started them in your feelings. I known it must have been so, or you could not have been so horribly deceived." 
                  "Well?" said I, turning my house square across the road, and clutching his by the mane, "Well?" 
                  "Well, then, she dropped her head again, and seemed really convulsed with grief. Her tears rained upon my shoulder, and 'My poor, poor, ruined cousin! my good, angel cousin! my heart's sister! seemed to wrench her very life out in the utterance. A moment's silence, a strong shudder, and it came. Turning quickly form me, she stood droopingly, while she said, in the deepest tones of grief and shame: 'Her beauty led him into sin, and he must find some one to marry her, for he was himself engaged, and could not;' and, with a bound, she dashed down the hillside, and was hid from me in the thicket." 
                  "Ashleigh!" 
                  "Doctor!" 
                  I believe I did as much had swearing as might serve a pirate for a voyage in the next thirty seconds. I saw the wretch's picture now as plainly as Ashleigh did awhile before, and there seemed to me but one word in English profane enough to name it by-that word was Nancy. It was an oath to me for years after. 
                  When I looked round next my friend was just in sight. I waited for him, and when he joined me he was humming a hymn tune, long metre, very solemnly. 
                  "Have you any more refreshing entertainment for me, Mr. Ashleigh?" said I; "there is a relish about that last tit-bit that gives me an appetite. Why, what a gem of a gipsy we have among us! That girl ought not to be thrown away upon trifles; she is fit to plot for a kingdom. Among the fools and scoundrels of the great world she would make a figure. But, tell me what you thought, and said, and did about it. Your first thought first-I'm curious." 
                  "My thoughts! I believe I did no thinking of any kind for an hour. My soul stood still like a frozen cataract. I passed the night in a very quiet sort of stupor. The mere mechanism of the mind carries on one's life pretty well, you know; and, in the morning, I simply told Elizabeth that Nancy must not be invited to our wedding. That was all. And I never said a word about it to her till last week, when she urged me for my reason for the request." 
                  "And what did Elizabeth say, Ashleigh, after you told her?" 
                  "She held her breath till my story was finished, and sat astonished and speechless till I left her to recover herself. An hour after she came to me, and said: 'George I have poured out my thanks to heaven, and I come to bless you that you did not in any manner mention this to me before our marriage; for I never could have fulfilled my engagement with you, with that horrible pit opened up between us.' Again the promise is fulfilled to me, 'Upon all thy glory there shall be a defence.'" 
                  The solution is easy. Nancy had wakened up with a surprise to find the Reverend Mr. Ashleigh, a splendid preacher, a gentleman of rank and fortune, in love with her poor cousin! poor, in a sense, to Nancy, that took all the pity out of it; a spiritless, meek beauty, unconscious of her availabilities in the market, and stupidly devoted to silence, sacrifice and duty. To be undermined, and, in some sense, defrauded, by so simple a sheep of the flock, was almost incredible, but it was not the less certain. And counting upon Mr. Ashleigh's softness, by the same rule which had already misjudged Elizabeth her plot was adjusted with great skill to the case, and as well executed. 
                  But, the devil would be only a fool in heaven, and would fail to make the angels misunderstand each other, whatever other success his villainies might meet with; for the faith of a pure heart "tries the spirits," and discerns vital truth by its own instincts. 
                
                
                   
                  EUTHANASIA. 
                  A SOCIETY of forty or fifty persons meets every Tuesday night in this city. The members are of both sexes and all ages, from fourteen to sixty. The room is neatly furnished and cheerfully lighted. They give the first hour of the evening to free social intercourse; the next to the discussion of questions of religion, politics, and the social and industrial sciences: and the last hour is again devoted to conversation, music and dancing, as the several parties are inclined. Visitors are welcomed, and often make one-third of the company. They are at liberty to participate as freely in all the engagements of the evening as the members themselves. The meetings are found equally attractive to a great variety of tastes, which has the effect of balancing all their exercises and merriment, and keeping them in healthful harmony. 
                  About a year ago I began to notice the constant attendance of two ladies, who were both in their way very unlike the rest of the company. They were mother and daughter-the one fifty years of age, perhaps, and the other about seventeen. The old lady's manner plainly indicated that she did not come there on her own account. She was not out of place there, indeed, but her life had been too full of sadness and toil, and she was now too hopeless and anxious to take much interest in either the studies or amusements which occupied the company. She evidently came there only to accompany her daughter, and to watch over her; for Mary was dying of consumption. It was the marks of hectic fever which first fastened my attention upon her How the flashing ing light of her eye, the crimson glow on her cheek, and the merry ring of her childish glee, seemed to mock the malady that was preying upon her life! To a thoughtless observer, her mirth was faulty in its exuberance, and her manner too childishly free for one of her age. Poor Mary! Society was a festival to her. She came away from her little sick room, and climbed up those long steep stairs, three stories high, to the hall, once every week, to have a happy evening in the happiness of others; and something of the mirthfulness she showed was owing to the opium she took to suppress her cough while in the room. But it was not dissipation and forgetfulness that she sought. She was not flying from a fear, or running into incongruous follies to drown reflection. She knew she was dying; knew it well, and made the thought as welcome as it was familiar. Her gaiety was not in keeping with the sadness that others felt who saw her dropping so young into the grave; but this was because the grave to them was more gloomy than it could be to her. I have often taken her burning hand in mine to cool it, lifted her shining chesnut curls that dangled damp with the dews of fever, and tried to quiet, with a gentle steady look, the effervescence that agitated her whole frame. That thin hand, so moist and damp, and yet so hot; the wrist, so feeble and flexile, its sharp, corded, wiry pulse; and the boiling blood, thrilling and whirling through it-oh, how its hot surges were wasting the delicate structure which so slightly held in that young life! How I longed for the power to rebuke the fever that was melting her with its fervent heat! 
                  When she would detect this feeling in my manner, she sometimes spoke of her approaching death with such serene cheerfulness, that I, with my full strong health and great heart-load of loving work to do in the world before I dare to die, could not understand, so as to realize, her beautiful resignation. It seemed to me that the bright young creature felt as children feel about moving to a new house: or as young birds must feel while waiting for their wings to bathe in the sea of air and play among the clouds of heaven. Mary's whole manner was such that one loved her like a pet child-a child surrendering all the uses of the world, all its prospects and promises, and asking only leave to play with the flowers growing around the margin of her early grave. 
                  She was a young lady in years and in form, but that was not felt in her presence. She was not vain, or exacting, or roublesome or troubled with any form of self consciousness. She was not remarkable for personal beauty, talents or accomplishments, but she was without their pretence, and so had the charm of a graceful naturalness that made her more agreeable than any mannerism could. She studied nothing, for she had no designs and no fears; nothing to conceal and nothing to achieve; and so, the world, like a panorama, passed before her. She was in it, but not of it; and with our selfishness and passions and prejudices she had no strife. The blessed child! what interests, what establishment should she have in this rude outside world of ours? She had not done dressing her doll till she began to think of her shroud! Her brothers and sisters had all died of consumption at an early age. She had been going to their funerals at regular intervals, ever since she learned to walk: and she knew, always knew, that the measure of her days was limited almost to her childhood, and all her little plans for temporary living were habitually arranged in reference to its early date. 
                  Mary came regularly for many months to our meetings, weary as the work of climbing those long, steep stairs must have been to her; but at the end of the winter I missed her; evening after evening she was not there, till I knew that she would come no more to us as she had come. 
                   
                  Following the directions of a friend who had often seen her at home, I made my way to the little court where she lived, through a narrow street and still narrower alley in the heart of the city. In one of a dozen little tenements which made up the court I found her residence. A woman at the hydrant which supplied them all in common pointed out the door for me. The old lady answered my knock, and, after a friendly greeting, gave me a chair in the room which constituted the ground-floor of the dwelling, till "she would see whether Mary was sleeping." Five minutes I waited while she was "putting things to rights a little," and I was shown up a pair of stairs, steep, winding and narrow, almost, as a corkscrew, and, at the head of them was our Mary's nice little chamber. It was narrow and low, but it was clean and sweet, and the open window let in the fresh air and sunlight of the early spring day, so as to remove that feeling of closeness and confinement which oppresses one so much in sick rooms that are too small. 
                  I found her sitting nearly upright in bed, propped with pillows. A fit of coughing that seized her as I entered kept me standing several minutes by her bedside before she could speak to me, but when the paroxysm subsided, and the faintly-whispered words came, almost voiceless as they were, they had yet the clear tone of a ripening hope and the accustomed feeling of cheerfulness in them. Somehow I felt that there was not so much of trial as of triumph in her struggle. The heart was fluttering wildly though feebly, the lungs were panting and sobbing with the pain and weariness of their hurried heavings, and the limbs lay faint and exhausted with the prolonged strife, but the soul was calm and collected, like a dove brooding her hope amid the tempest. Something she said of her long and weary night watchings, and of her feverish days-of the pain and fatigue of coughing, and of the posture which her oppressed breathing compelled, and a little sadly, as of a hardship, that she lasted so much longer after her confinement to bed than her brothers had done. 
                  I had brought with me a rose geranium, the only thing that I could find in the market which pleased me. I bought it only because among half a dozen friends whom I had called upon in my way I had not been able to procure the present of a flower for her. When I held it up to her as she sat in her bed, she opened her eyes with such a pleased recognition as a child gives to a gay color or a bright light. She touched its leaves with her fingers tenderly, buried her face among them, was curiously attentive to their form and color, and looked as lovingly upon them as if they might have some simple consciousness of her regards. 
                  "Oh, it is so beautiful, so sweet!" said she. "And where did you get it?" 
                  Hesitatingly I answered, "In the market," with a feeling that the fact would abate her pleasure. 
                  Withdrawing her hand, and slightly averting her face, she said, "Oh, you had to buy it. I thought, may-be, some of the ladies had sent it to me. They sent me some of the cake from their quarterly festival last week, and I was so glad that they thought of me when they were enjoying themselves." 
                  When I bought the plant I felt that it was hurt by the traffic. It was so far profaned to me. The banker and broker and huckster had come in, and the love-token had sunk from its proper sphere and character into that of a commodity. It had not that sick, heavy odor that flowers torn from the stem always give out, as they languish away their lingering life in bouquets and vases, but it had stood upon the auction block and been sold for its beauty! Mary meant this, also, or she would not have turned away from it. As I sat it away in the window, I felt again as I felt at the last floral fair, that the useful only should be bought and sold, but that pure beauty, which is the form of love, its correlative and its language, should pass unpurchased from heart to heart. 
                  Mary was not a metaphysician, a sentimentalist, nor a talker. She was a simple child; her religious education was orthodox; and she had not disturbed the natural current of her feelings with fantastic theories. She had not learned, she knew all that she believed. 
                  It was quite clear to me that she had some notion of her future, which steadied her in approaching it. I asked her if it was clear to her what she should be, and, how, and where? She looked at me- 
                  "Do you believe in the divinity of Jesus?" said she. 
                  "I do believe it, Mary; it is the Divine humanity which assures my heart of the Divine sympathy, and my understanding rests in it as a necessary truth." 
                  "Oh!" she replied, "that is good; I am so glad. And I'll tell you-Last summer, you know, was so hot, and so close and dusty, in the city. I had a great deal of fever and the cough was very exhausting. Sometimes I got out to Fairmount in the omnibus, and it did me so much good to sit in the shadow of the bank, and drink out that little cup from the spring. Now, before the summer comes again, I'll be gone. I will not have the heat and pain and weariness and thirst of last summer to go through again; and-it will be so beautiful," she said softly to herself, with a smile of such tranquil assurance that when she paused, as if in silent enjoyment of the vision, or perhaps in doubt of my reception of it, I urged with-"How will be next summer, Mary?" 
                  Gathering confidence from my look of sympathy, she went on-"Oh! this summer, for it is just here to me, I will be walking in beautiful groves and meadows, filled with springs and streams of fresh sweet water-living water-and pleasant shade trees, and birds, and flowers, and all beautiful things; and my lungs will be well again, and I will breathe the fresh cool air, and I shall have all the fullness of health and life and joy!" 
                  "How long have you had this vision or idea of the other life?" 
                  "Always," she answered quickly; "ever since I can remember; only it has been growing lately more distinct and certain with me." 
                  "But this is all play, Mary; what will be your work, or will there be any work for you to do?" 
                  "Yes, to be sure; there will be something useful for me to do; I don't know what; indeed, I don't know what such a poor creature as I can do. I was scarcely done with child's play when I took sick, you know, and I have scarcely learned anything since. But it will be all right; I know it will; and I shall be busy and happy in the family of Our Father." 
                  Assuring her that it would be even as her heart prophesied, I left her; and in a few days heard that she was buried. 
                  Mary has recovered her health-the health of childhood in heaven; she has spent one summer of ours already, in its work and play, and the changes of the seasons there will bring her only changes of joy and work forever. 
                
                
                   
                  "TRIAL BY BATTEL." 
                  A DUEL is a fight between two persons with deadly weapons, according to some established rules, for the purpose of deciding a quarrel. In past times it was much in use, under various, forms, and upon various grounds and pretences. In our day it gets but little countenance from public opinion, and the laws of most civilized countries declare that the killing of a man in a duel is murder, and shall be punished as such. But the duel was not only allowed in England in early times, but it was actually appointed and employed as a legal method of trial in certain kinds of lawsuits about property, and in criminal charges generally. Indeed, this "trial by wager of battle," as it was called, was not abolished by law until the year 1817, though it had not been actually used since the time of Charles the First, or about two hundred years ago. It was introduced into English law by William the Conqueror (in the year 1066), who brought it with him from Normandy, as a part of that barbarous and superstitious system of military government which he established upon the ruins of the ancient Saxon institutions. The Germans, when they were first known to the Romans, had this custom; and among the Goths, in the country now called Sweden, it was, in like manner, a mode of trying suits at law. The first written authority for these judicial combats is found in the laws of Burgundy, A. D. 500. In England for six hundred years, down till a century after the Reformation, the trial by battle was in actual use under the laws of the land. It was resorted to as an appeal to "the God of battles," in the belief that he would give the victory to the party that had the right. The cases tried in this way were of the kinds in which there was some uncertainty, or difficulty, or impossibility of settlement by courts and juries upon the usual kinds of evidence and proof-in disputed land titles, for instance. In that early time written deeds and wills were not in use; and when claims were set up which were so old that the witnesses were dead, or of any kind that the courts could not certainly determine, they were referred to this supernatural sort of decision. In criminal charges, if the offender was caught in the act, he was not allowed his appeal to arms; but whenever there was a doubt, he might challenge his accuser to decide it by combat. One of the oldest English law-writers justifies this custom by the example of the combat between David, on the part of the Israelites, and Goliah, the champion of the Philistines. So the Bible has been quoted in past times as authority for wrong doing, and so it is still perverted and abused in our own day. 
                  In civil cases-that is, in suits about property-the battle was not fought by the parties to the suit, but by their champions, hired or otherwise obtained for the purpose. It is very likely that bullies were hired then as lawyers are now-to beat each other, only in a different way-a hard head then, a well-filled one now-stout arms then, a nimble tongue now; and, in both, willingness to fight for either side of any case. In criminal cases, the combat was required to be in person, and not by attorney or champion, which means the same thing. But if either the accused or accuser were a woman, a priest, or under twenty-one years of age or over sixty, or lame or blind, such person might refuse the challenge, and have the case tried by a jury. 
                  When the battle was appointed and the combatants entered the field, they took an oath in which each declared that his cause was just; and where the champions fought for hire, they took the same oath, and furthermore swore that they used no magic, sorcery, or enchantment. The precise words of this last declaration were these-"Hear this, ye justices, that I have this day neither ate, drank, nor have upon me neither bone, stone, nor grass, nor any enchantment, sorcery, or witchcraft, whereby the law of God may be abased, or the law of the devil exalted. So help me God and his saints." 
                  The judges attended these legal combats in their robes of office, that they might witness the result and give judgment in the suit accordingly. But the battle was not fought with deadly weapons, and death seldom ensued. Each party was furnished with a baton or staff an ell long (about four feet), and a four-cornered leathern target for defence. If the defendant in the action could maintain his defence till the stars appeared in the evening, or killed his antagonist, or forced him to yield and cry "craven," his defence was judged complete. If he yielded, or was killed, his case was decided against him. In criminal charges, if the accuser killed the accused, it was taken for the decision of Providence; or if he pressed him so hard that he could not or would not fight any longer, he was condemned and punished forthwith as guilty. On the other hand, if the accuser was conquered, he was pronounced infamous, and could never be a juror or a witness in any case afterwards, because, as it was said, he had sworn to a falsehood, and charged an innocent man with a crime. 
                  All the reasoning for this trial by battle, or legal duel, turned upon the presumption that in the kind of cases where human judgments were doubtful, the Divine Providence would decide the appeal as the real justice of the case required. Wars between different nations, and armed rebellions against despotic Governments, rest upon the same notion of presumed interference by Providence in disputes where there are no earthly courts or judges to decide between the parties. The trial by battle is the way that nations "go to law" now. One would think that the result of wars being so often manifestly against the right, and in favor of the wrong, the world would give up this superstitious notion; but it is, nevertheless, true, that the weaker side at least, and the oppressed party, in all wars and revolutions, always take up arms in some confidence that the "God of Battles" will somehow fight for the right. And curiously enough, too, where the opposed armies are of the same religion, and even of the same nation also, they have clergymen, called army chaplains, who daily make public prayers to the same God for victory to both sides! If these preachers in the opposite camps could be brought together into one prayer-meeting, each party calling upon the Supreme Being for the overthrow and destruction of the other, they would appear to us as they must appear to the angels. Good angels must weep and evil angels laugh at such a sight. 
                  The revolutionists all over Europe, in the year 1848 and 1849, went to battle against kings and tyrants in this belief of the Divine assistance in killing their oppressors. Yet they were everywhere beaten by the superior force of their enemies, or by divisions and treachery among themselves. 
                  So far as we have been considering the duel between individuals and between nations, in the cases where it is either believed or pretended that Heaven will decide the trial according to justice, we need add no words to show how idle and foolish such a faith is. The words of Jesus to Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane are his answer to this whole question-"Put up thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword." He would not employ or authorize one man to take the life of another. He that enjoins the forgiveness of injuries and the love of enemies can never help us to kill them. Besides, He adds that he has "more than twelve legions of angels" at his command, if he wished to destroy men's lives. (Matthew xxvi. 52, 53.) 
                  But the duel now has not the hardihood to call itself anything better than honorable revenge, or murder with fair play and an equal risk to both parties. It is no longer resorted to on any pretence that God will take part in the horrible struggle, and decide for the right, but it is undertaken in open defiance to the laws of God and man: 
                         
                           "And if the holiest name is there, 
                           'Tis more in blasphemy than prayer." 
                        
                     
                   
                  This is bad enough and wicked enough, and more so than one could think reasonable human beings could be guilty of; but it is sometimes, perhaps always, more or less mean or cowardly, as well as brutal and bloodthirsty. More than one challenge has been given and accepted, and many a duel has been fought, too, in which one or both of the parties has felt as much of fear as of malignity. Duels arise in this way: Some one, having too little regard for justice or truth or good manners to govern his tongue and conduct with propriety, does another an injury, or offers him an insult. Now, such a man is more likely to be a coward than a brave man in even the lowest sense of the word; for sound courage is made up of confidence in one's self, in the rightness of his own conduct and intentions, in the approbation of the good and wise, and in the Divine support. But the wrongdoer has none of these reliances, and he can have nothing but mere animal hardihood to maintain him against the natural fear of truth and justice which threaten him with open shame, and this fear takes away all the proper manliness of his daring. Audacity is not bravery, for it is blind and unprincipled, and will not support a man one moment in the presence of light and truth. 
                  But, the innocent and injured party in a quarrel may be a good and true man. Yes, and he will remain so until feelings of revenge and thoughts of murder drown out his better nature, and make him fierce, selfish, and reckless of right and duty. Can a good man consent to kill one whom a wife or child or parent loves, however unworthy that one may be? Can a good man disobey all rightful authority? Can a good man be absolutely relentless and cruel? Alas! when the demon of revenge and blood takes possession he drives out every virtue and every feeling that enters into the character of a brave man; for where all law is defied there is no respect left for honor or fair play, and the maddened monster will take all the advantages which cowardice itself asks against a foe. Moreover, in nine cases out of ten, one or both the persons engaged enter into it, not willingly, but by a force which he has not quite courage enough to resist. He is really more afraid of the character of coward than of the little risk of a fight. Some bad friend, who cares nothing for another's risk, tells him that he must fight, and he suffers himself to be bullied into it. He sends a challenge or accepts one in the hope that the quarrel may be made up before the fatal meeting, or, at the worst, after an ineffectual shot has been exchanged. In a word, he gets into it as other people commit other crimes-with a blind hope that the worst consequences may be somehow escaped. And then, there is the hope of getting credit for the very thing he most wants-courage. Oh, how anxious the coward is for a character. So between the force of fools' opinions, which are strong with him, and the chance of escape, which is quite promising, and the prospect of a brag affair, the poor fellow will manage to pick up as much extemporaneous pluck as might help him to be hanged pretty decently if he happened to be going to the gallows instead of the field of honor. In favorable circumstances, with everything to help and everybody looking on, the most shabby fellows generally contrive to make a tolerable show of themselves. There is always and everywhere a grand difference between the lofty daring that becomes a man, and the poor counterfeit appearance that is put on to get the reputation of a man. But-we have a story to tell that will show up this matter better and more pleasantly than we can do it in a dull argument. 
                
                
                   
                  THE DUEL. 
                  FROM the commencement of our Revolution till the year 1815, a period of forty years, England was engaged in war without any intermission. These wars were with the thirteen colonies, or United States, France, Spain, Holland, the French Republic, Bonaparte, and again with the United States; sometimes singly, sometimes with several of these nations at once. 
                  The battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th June, 1815. That year the army of England amounted to three hundred thousand men; and in 1845, although she had enjoyed thirty years of peace, her standing army was still one hundred thousand strong. 
                  In the time of peace one would think that such a host of soldiers could not be required for any purpose; and they probably are not, but it is the policy of such governments as that of England to keep as many men in the public service as possible. To say nothing of other purposes, it is easy, in an army of a hundred thousand soldiers, to have four or five thousand commissioned officers, who generally belong to the class of gentlemen-a class that is found to furnish the most useful and the most submissive slaves to those who feed them. The most useful, because, being well-born, well-educated and well-connected, they are very capable in themselves, and very influential with others; and most submissive, because they are so well paid, and have no other service than public office which it suits them to accept. 
                  The army of England is crowded with officers who enter it merely as a trade or profession, by which they may get a living. A horrid business it is, indeed, to undertake to do any killing of men anywhere that the Government may command, without asking any questions, or knowing or caring whether it is right or wrong! But so it is, when rightly understood; and yet, we must not be surprised if we find, once in a while, a man too good for such a trade engaged in it, for it is generally thought honorable, even the most honorable of all professions, and but few stop to inquire if it is also right. 
                  My story will introduce the sort of man that is an exception to the rule. 
                  To be perfectly candid with my readers, I must inform them that I have forgotten the names of the persons that I am to tell about. The precise place where it happened has also escaped me, but I am sure that it was somewhere in Ireland; and the exact date is gone, too-but I know that it was after the year 1815, and before the year 1835, for that was the time when I heard it. 
                  The general peace of Europe, which followed the fall of Napoleon, released the army of England from foreign service and, after reduction to about one-third of its former number, it was distributed among the military stations within the kingdom and provinces. A large number of the surviving officers of the field of Waterloo were garrisoned in Ireland. They were generally men who had seen hard service, and had earned their honors and offices in the battle-field; but a considerable number of new men received appointments through favor of their wealthy and powerful friends, and came among the veterans with commissions in their pockets which gave them high rank in the army. The old soldiers, naturally enough, looked upon these raw recruits as mere upstarts and intruders. They despised them for their inexperience, and hated them for the injustice suffered by their promotion. In a profession where honor is gained by killing the country's enemies, it will scarcely be thought immoral to hate the individual's rivals and supplanters. The Apostle John says, that murder and hating one's brother go together. And, taking the military sentiment for the standard of judgment, it is mean to beg or buy promotion, where other people have to fight for it. But this is done elsewhere, as well as in the British army; for the offices which are thought the most honorable are often obtained by means the most dishonorable. 
                  The hero of my story was in this situation; and whether he deserved the judgment we have passed upon his class, or not, he certainly suffered it in full measure. He had obtained, by patronage, the appointment of Ensign, after the establishment of peace, and was quartered, with some dozen or twenty officers of Wellington's army, in one of the cities of Ireland. An Ensign is the lowest commissioned officer, and the salary, or pay, is so small that it is a saying, "If an Ensign has wine for dinner, he must go without supper." Our Ensign was very poor-he was friendless, very young, and constitutionally shy. 
                  On the other hand, the officers of the station were generally well supplied with money, and had nothing to do but spend it; they lived fast and high, and were, by all their habits and tastes, unpleasant companions for such as he. Besides his retiring manners, there was something else in him which disinclined him to their society, and exposed him to their dislike; this was a certain air of self-respect, showing refinement and culture, and a strict propriety of language and manners, which quietly, but all the more severely, rebuked their general looseness and rudeness of conduct. They hated him for the manner he entered the army, and still worse for his personal character and demeanor among them. All this had its effect upon him also, and so the breach between them widened every day. 
                  A certain amount and kind of courtesy he was entitled to, by the rules of the service; this they gave him, but so sharply measured out, that every salute was an affront, and every look an insult, and he might have had cause of quarrel at any moment that he pleased. It was, in fact, the settled purpose of several of these men to drive him out of the army by their incivilities, or to drive him into a duel, and so dispose of him finally. 
                  Things grew worse continually. The contempt of the older officers for the young Ensign, and his repugnance to them, increased with every meeting, until they paid no kind of respect to his feelings, and he avoided them with a caution that looked like antipathy. The worst of all was the evident conviction in the minds of the whole garrison that he was a coward-a character most shameful in a soldier, and, in any man, a weakness that renders every other virtue worthless. 
                  Poor fellow! he was alone, friendless, and without a dollar in the world but his monthly pay. With these beggarly circumstances he was a scholar and a gentleman, with feelings rendered over-sensitive by high culture and recent misfortunes. But his chief impediment was a conscience-a religious sense of right, which left him no liberty to relieve himself or mend his prospects by any means which the highest morality forbade. He suffered much every way, and most of it all he endured for "righteousness sake." Of course he had the strength and nobleness which such a sentiment bestows; but it is easier to do great things than to bear little ones. There are more heroes than saints in the world. St. Peter was not afraid of the soldiers in the garden den, but he was ashamed of his master in the Judgment Hall. To bear disgrace, and shame, and scorn, to stand quiet under suspicions that drive one out of society, for the sake of a principle which nobody believes or respects-this is cross-bearing. 
                  Our young hero occupied the position of a soldier and a gentleman, with the character of a coward and a slave! It was a bitter cup, and his enemies kept it constantly to his lips. 
                  One day he received an invitation, as a matter of course, to dine with the General in command, who had just arrived at the station. A meeting with his brother officers promised him no pleasure, and he was personally a stranger to the General, who knew nothing of him but by report of those who despised him. He managed to arrive at the latest allowable moment, and he contrived to procure a seat at table next to the General, who, both as his host and superior officer, was bound to afford him protection from the insolence of the company. 
                  I need not say how the dinner hour passed with him. Totally silent and neglected, except for the necessary notice of the General, the time, so full of pleasure to the company, wore away heavy and painful to him; but he was contented to escape rudeness, and made indifference comparatively welcome. 
                  After the cloth was removed the wine circulated, the company drank freely, the mirth grew loud, and the presence of our young friend was nearly forgotten, until a circumstance of a startling character brought him into notice. The General suddenly cried out, "Gentlemen, I have lost my watch-I had it in my hand ten minutes ago, but it is gone." A painful suspense instantly followed; every man exchanged glances with his neighbor, until at last every eye settled with suspicion upon the young Ensign. Who but he, of all the company, could be guilty of such a crime? Besides, he was, perhaps, the only man near enough to the General to effect the theft. Such thoughts as these were in every mind-they left not a shade of doubt. The miserable wretch was caught at last; and there was as little pity as respect felt for him. 
                  "Shut the door," shouted the Colonel of the regiment, "let no man leave the room. The watch is among us, and it concerns every man present to fix the guilt where it belongs. I propose that a search be instantly made, and let it begin with me." 
                  "By no means," interposed the General. "It shall not be so. No gentleman is capable of such an act. A hundred watches are not worth the impeachment of any gentleman's honor. Say no more about it. It has no special value above its price, and I care nothing about that." 
                  "But, General," said the Colonel, "the watch is in the room. One of us must have it," looking sternly at the young Ensign, "and the rascal must be driven from the station. We cannot have a pickpocket among us, and we cannot consent to leave it a moment in doubt who the wretch really is. There is no fear that the shame will fall in any unexpected place. We must finish the fellow now, and be done with him." 
                  The Ensign sat steady, motionless and pale as death. Every eye was fixed upon him, and to every eye the signs of guilt were perfectly clear. The General had no doubt of it, and he was the more anxious to prevent the search on this account; but he was overcome, and submitted. A few minutes sufficed for the examination of every one present, till it came to the Ensign, who was left purposely to the last. 
                  "Now, young man," said the Colonel, turning and advancing ing toward him, "now, sir, it is your turn;" his face looking perfectly savage with scorn and hate. "The watch, sir, without a word or a moment's delay!" 
                  But a terrific change had passed upon the long-suffering, patient boy. He sprang from his seat with a scream so wild, so fierce, and so full of agony that every heart stood still a moment with surprise. In that moment he had planted himself against the wall, drawn his sword, and taken the attitude of defence. 
                  "Come you to search me, sir, as you would a suspected thief? On your life, I warn you not to offer me that indignity. My dead body you may search, but not my living one. Approach now if you dare. I defy the whole of you as one man!" 
                  Instantly the Colonel crossed swords with him in furious combat. 
                  "Hold! peace! arrest them!" cried the General, and sprang forward himself to prevent the affray. At the first step, the watch rolled on the floor! He had missed his fob, and now the watch fell from its concealment in the violence of his movements. The company was electrified. The conduct of the Ensign was inexplicable! He had braved destruction, risked his reputation, and perilled his life, on a point of honor too nice for his superiors to feel; and he had insulted and defied them all in one breath, and there he stood justified and victorious before them! 
                  It was too much to bear, for they were too much excited to understand it. Their determination was taken, and the company dispersed with resolutions set, and purposes inflexible. The General seized the opportunity to apologize to the Ensign for the unhappy mistake which led to the quarrel, and requested him to call upon him that evening at a late hour. 
                   
                  Our hero was scarcely in his own room till the Colonel's challenge was presented to him. Without a moment's delay he answered the second who brought it: "I will not accept this challenge to mortal combat. I am opposed to the duel on principle, and I will not be driven from my sense of, duty. You all know what I have already endured rather than revenge or defend myself by taking life. I think you have done your worst, but if not, I am prepared for it. I am my own master, and will not allow any man to dictate my opinions in a matter of right, or compel me to conduct which my heart and head condemn. 
                  "Sir," replied the second, "you have seen fit to include me among the men who despise you, and you are right in that opinion. Let me tell you, that cowardice and conceit, covered with preaching and canting, will not protect you. You have grossly insulted every gentleman in the garrison, to whom you were odious enough before, and you must either give them the satisfaction which the code of honor approves, or you must leave the army. Be assured of that." 
                  When he met the General that night, and informed him of the challenge and his refusal, that officer shook his head and looked at him sadly and earnestly, if not doubtfully. 
                  "My dear young friend," said he, "I am afraid it won't do. These men will not be satisfied with an argument, and it is plain that you are not the man to make an apology while convinced that you are right, nor do I believe that they would accept anything short of your resignation. You have somehow got the ill-will of the whole corps, and to-night you affronted them mortally. I am sure you cannot know how sharply your conduct and language touched them, and your triumph only aggravated the offence. And, now, your refusal to accept the Colonel's challenge is, under, the most favorable construction, an attack upon the code by which military men govern themselves toward each other. I see no escape. Fight you must, or your challenger will heap upon you such personal indignities as will make your life intolerable, or drive you into violence, which will amount to the same thing as accepting his challenge. I saw that in your eye to-day which convinces me that you are as brave as Julius Csar. Yes, I saw something there braver than mere physical courage, and I felt its superiority; but, you cannot convert the world and reform the army soon enough to answer your own ends, and you must submit to its rules, or be driven from it in disgrace. I honor your principles, for I understand them, but you cannot maintain them." 
                  Our hero's reflections that night must be left to imagination. The difficulties which surrounded him, the compulsions that were upon him, can be known only to those who have been tempted and tried to the utmost, with the world and their own necessities against them. 
                  In the morning he accepted the challenge. 
                  Having the right to choose the weapons, he named the small-sword. When the Colonel heard this, with a touch of feeling, which all his bitterness could not quite, extinguish, he said: "Does the moth know that he is fluttering into the flame?" The second answered, "I told him that you are reputed the best swordsman in the army, and begged him to choose pistols, which would give him some chance of equality in the fight, but he declined. In fact, I don't know what to make of this young fellow-like the sword that he has chosen to fight with, he is so limber, and yet so elastic and mettlesome, sometimes; he is such a mixture of methodist, mule and madman, that I cannot make him out. And, Colonel, he is not a light bargain, either, for anybody. It seems to me that you were making nothing off him, yesterday, when the General interfered. The fellow actually stood up handsomely, and made very pretty play with his weapon. To tell the truth, I'm beginning to like him a little, and I feel sorry that he must be disposed of in your peculiar way." 
                  The Colonel muttered, grimly, "If I must kill the rascal, I'm glad he shows some pluck and capacity in the business; I don't want to be a boy-butcher." 
                  The next morning, at early sunrise, they met on the field of honor.
                   
                  When the ground was prepared, and the champions stood armed and ready, the Ensign suddenly lowered his sword point, and, addressing his antagonist, said: "Sir, I am here under compulsion, merely. I do not consent to this practice. To me it is absurd as it is wicked. It settles no right, and it redresses no wrong. Let me say, then, that if my patience has given way under my persecutions, and if I have, by a hasty word or act, justly offended you, I am willing to retract it. What is your complaint?" 
                  "Young man, I came here not to preach, but to fight. I came here not to confer with you about nice points in casuistry, but to punish your impudence; but, if you have no relish for that, I will spare your life, on condition that you leave the army-take your choice." 
                  The Ensign's answer was prompt and firm: 
                  "You will have it so-I am guiltless," and the fencing began. 
                  The seconds and witnesses had never seen such a display of skill, and they never dreamed of such a result. In five minutes the Colonel was disarmed, and at the mercy of the insulted and outraged boy!
                   
                  Heated by the struggle, and excited by the imminent peril and bloody bitterness and fury of his enemy, he turned from him somewhat haughtily, with-"I have taught you a lesson in sword-play, and now I will set you another, which you need even more-an example of moderation in success." 
                  The Colonel's mortification and rage seemed to know no bounds. 
                  "I accept no favors from such a canting, phrase-making sentimentalist-such a mere fencing-master-such a trickster and conjuring sword-player as you are," the Colonel burst out through his grinding teeth. "You knew well what you were about when you chose these toys to play tricks with. If you have a sentiment of honor left in you, let me have pistols. I tell you this quarrel is not made up. I will not have my life at your gift. You shall take it or I will take yours. The quarrel is to the death, and there is a blow to clinch it," striking at the Ensign in a transport of passion, which he avoided with equal coolness and dexterity. 
                  The seconds interfered, and even the spectators cried shame; but it was clear enough that blood must flow before the parties should quit the ground. The Ensign's second, carried away by the excitement, urged him to accept the new challenge or change of conditions, for he despaired of any other adjustment. 
                  "Will nothing satisfy this madman but my life?" said the young officer, deeply agitated. 
                  "You have made him mad," said the second, "and there is nothing left for it but a fatal issue. You have the right to refuse, having already spared his life, and I will sustain you; but I do not advise it, for it will be unavailing in the end." 
                  "I have gone too far," replied the Ensign, sadly, "too far from the line of strict principle, to recover it now. I cannot any longer say that I am opposed to fighting; I have broken down that defence by yielding to an expediency which I thought a safe one. Oh, it is horrible! I did not dream this morning that I might die a fool's death to-day." 
                   
                  "You will accept the offer," hastily interposed the second; "you must be a good shot, with such an eye and hand, and such self-possession as you have shown to-day. If your pistol matches your sword you cannot miss him, and upon my soul, he deserves it, and I say let him have it. You accept." 
                  The Ensign stood silent. The ground was measured, the pistols prepared, and the combatants stationed. The word was given. One-two-three. The Colonel's pistol was discharged at the instant, and the Ensign stood untouched. He had reserved his fire, and had the right now to take deliberate aim. Steadily he raised the deadly weapon, till it bore point blank upon the Colonel's heart, and there it rested a minute in terrible suspense; not a nerve quivered, not a limb trembled in either, and the spectators held their breath hushed as the death they waited for. But suddenly wheeling, the Ensign marked a post in a different direction, at twice the distance of his antagonist, and, pulling the trigger, delivered his ball in it, breast-high. It was a centre shot, and instantly fatal if a living, man had stood there. The next instant, throwing down the pistol with decision that could not be mistaken, he cried out: "I will go no farther in this wicked folly. If there is nothing else left for me but murder or submission, I will submit." 
                  The grandeur of his position was too striking now to be mistaken or denied. The Colonel was the first to acknowledge it. Twice within the hour he owed a life to the magnanimity of a man he had so much abused. That man stood now vindicated, even by the hard laws of war and honor-he was neither trickster nor coward. Possibly the Colonel felt something of the higher nobility of the young man's principles, but I will not be sure of that. He found him brave and generous, and that was enough, without looking deeper for the hidden springs of the nobler life within him. 
                   
                  Advancing to him, he offered his hand, apologized frankly for all his misconduct, acknowledged his misconception of the character which he had put to so severe a trial, and added that he was willing to owe his life to "the bravest man he had ever met, either as friend or foe." 
                  "Brave!" said the young man with the color mounting to cheek and brow. "Brave! Colonel-pardon me-Heaven pardon me! True bravery consists in refusing to fight altogether. But I have betrayed a principle which I should have valued more than life; I have risked my life-not for that principle, but to satisfy a caprice-I am the miserable hero of a miserable falsehood, instead of the martyr of a great truth. I have lost confidence in myself and men's praises only mock me."

                  MANY people make the grand mistake of endeavoring to adapt themselves in company to persons distinguished for particular talents or attainments. The fault is in the effort to get into their vein-to be witty with witty people, to tell stories to good story tellers, to discuss deep subjects with learned men, and, generally, to be sympathetically sucked into the drift of the nearest current. This is a mistake all round. No man's hobby will carry double. The attempt must fail; for, if you are inferior to the man you pitch into, he sets you down for a bore, and is disgusted; if you clearly excel him, he feels that you are a bully, and he hates you. 
                  There are these two good reasons for being easy, natural and yourself with everybody-nothing else suits you, and nothing else is asked of you. There are two more reasons for the same thing-persons of good taste dislike any thing else; and, you are wanted in your own natural shape to fit your company ball and socket fashion. Nothing packs society together so well as for some one to be hollow just where somebody else bulges. Be receptive, therefore, to the man of science, enjoy the joker without a struggle for supremacy, and play conductor for the electricity of the wit; then, if there is any thing in the fellows, you'll get it out of them and contribute best to the enjoyment of the company; and besides, if there is nothing particular in you (which is barely possible, but still possible), you won't expose yourself and annoy other people

                  CORRESPONDENTS need continually to be told that long, limber, loose, lazy articles, must either be rejected altogether or deferred till some accident opens a vacancy for them. Another thing-they will not be read. Instead of sprawling an open textured talk over a dozen pages of foolscap, drive it up into a compact, comfortable compass, and roll it in as fast as you like; we'll put it out. Besides, it will be capital practice in the art of composition to make one word do the dull drudgery of a dozen. We do not claim to observe this rule ourselves, for we have not the time to be short; the more need for holding a tight rein upon other people. All of which is respectfully submitted. 
                  While we are on the subject we may as well set a copy for the boys to follow. 
                  Mr. Wesley, on the text "Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee," says: "This day, i.e. from all eternity, which by its unalterable permanency of duration, is one continued unsuccessive day." 
                  There is a pattern for you-a whole cord of ordinary commentary crystalized into a gem of lustrous expression. That is the way to put the life and power of poetry into the form of prose. By the way-Mr. Wesley's commentary upon the New Testament is a most capital study for young writers, and a perfect verbifuge for drawlers, if they have the grace to profit by its exemplary style. 
                  Exactness of statement insures strength; compactness of argument regulates the length; and a young writer needs but one other rule for style-Whenever you write a sentence particularly fine-strike it out."

                  ABOUT a dozen years ago, a little cave was discovered in one of the ridges of the Alleghany mountain, in Somerset county, Pennsylvania. As it was the first hole in the ground that had made itself discovered in "them diggins," it became the subject of many grave and deep speculations among the mountain philosophers. The schoolmasters and itinerant clergymen of the district were regularly persecuted for a theory; the tin peddlers were pumped dry without affording a satisfactory solution, and the natives were compelled at last to settle down upon the conclusion that it was a "real natural phenomenon," for which they were indebted to a Philadelphia clerk, who rode a dun horse through the country, on a visit to his Boss's customers who kept their retail stores I at cross roads, grist mills and smith shops among the hills. 
                  Opinion hung here quietly, in a fair equilibrium between a fact not generally understood and an explanation as puzzling, until the occurrence of a great cabin-raising in the neighborhood brought all the wits and wonderers together. It happened that an old land-surveyor, formerly a residenter of the township, was at the raising. He had many years before been the pivot man of that region. He carried a compass, made drafts and calculations, examined candidate schoolmasters, took two newspapers, attended the county court every term, practised horse and cow doctoring, spoke two languages, generally together, but could swop English and Dutch back and forward well enough for household purposes, wore a double cased silver watch, that kept time to a second with the sun all the year round, and never went to Methodist preaching, shooting matches, or weddings, spoke seldom but solemnly, and never was known to be out of chewing-tobacco; Above all, he had the ARTZSPEIGEL (magic glass), a triangular piece of looking-glass, buried seven years in the gateway of a graveyard, in which he could see what the Free Masons were doing in their lodges, and discover stray cows and lost children, wherever they were wandering in the mountains. 
                  This wonderful man had done up the difficult thinking of that region for twenty or thirty years, and, variously endowed as he really was, it must be acknowledged that tradition had done something to embellish and even exaggerate his pretension. Quick as the tidings ran through the crowd that Uncle John had arrived, it flashed upon every man, woman and boy, that he was the very man for the "phenomenon;" and after a general hand shaking with all the old ones was performed, and all the young ones were told how much they had growed, and how well he minded their mothers when they were only gals, the mystery of the mountain was formally propounded, and his opinion anxiously requested. 
                  Uncle John squared himself, changed his quid, girded up the loins of his intellect, and, after the proper premonitory pause, delivered his oracle thus: "You see, a long time ago there was a wackum away down in nature; after while, along come a earthquake that shook all the stones that was in the cave, there, down into the wackum, and that's the way, the cave come. Q. E. D., as we surweyors says, that's what was to be demonstrated." 
                  And demonstrated it was, and the agony was over for ever so far as Alleghany township was concerned. But a lot of loafers at the country town took up the matter, and would have decided that the earthquake was unnecessary to the solution, on the ground that the philosopher might as well have put the vacuum at once into the cave, and saved the earthquake for some other subject, until one of them suggested that a chain of reasoning cannot be made out of single link; and beside that, earthquakes, thunder and lightning are indispensable to popular oratory. 
                  The genius that uttered this oracle, we need hardly say, has since risen to a very high rank as a popular orator. 
                
                
                  FEMALE PHYSICIANS. 
                  WE are informed that there is an institution in Boston in which there are fifteen women pursuing a regular course of medical study. Whether the course embraces all the branches of the profession with the thoroughness that qualifies for the practice we are not able to say. 
                  Instruction in anatomy sufficient for all the ordinary purposes of practice, except in surgery, is attainable to women now, and growing every year more complete, by the use of models, plates, books and lectures, eked out with a little actual dissection of the cadaver. On this they can get along at least as well as a large proportion of the profession does, and about as well as lawyers and preachers do with the Latin they tried to learn at College. Some pretty fair physicians never saw the thoracic duct, very few understand the anatomy of the abdominal ring, and a few have saved nothing of their learning but the pectoral muscle and the names of the biggest bones, the aorta, carotid artery and the optic nerves; with a plexus of processes, bifurcations, and emunctories, to keep the professional diction up to par. After a while, when popular lectures shall have furnished the crowd with the staple technicalities, there will be nothing left to protect the consecrated walks of the science from the profaning footsteps of the multitude. When the wig and cane went, the hedge was broke, and democracy with unwashed hands will soon be plucking the venerable beard of privilege. 
                  Besides the school at Boston, we have heard of several instances of ladies pursuing the study privately in other places, and we conclude that the enterprise of entering the profession is fairly on foot among the women of the East, and that before long the speculation will settle into the shape of fact. 
                  It is all nonsense to discuss the proprieties of such a movement; the thing must be decided by principle and not as a matter of taste. The practicability is the substance of the question, and nothing can settle that but experiment. Of the many who will make the earliest move, but few will be competent, in every way, to meet the exigencies of the trial. Some will be called, more will come, and the few will to chosen who may answer the demand and abide the test. But the whole matter will adjust itself. Prejudice and opinion may embarrass but cannot prevent, and pride and interest est may as well behave themselves, for what is to be will be, without their consent. 
                  The subject has been in some sort before the public, and has not created much of a crisis in the world's affairs as yet. Some months ago we noticed an article, bearing the earmarks of student authorship, in one of our blanket sized conserves of minced morality and lack-a-daisy literature, which shivered in every line with delicate distress at the thought of exposing innocent and defenceless womanhood to the awfulness of the sick chamber and the rude incidents of medical practice-as a physician; as patient, or servant, or nurse, it is, of course, all right, and nice, and proper. 
                  In that sphere-(the word sphere is a word of unfathomed meaning and unmeasured power in all debates about women)-in that sphere, womanhood is well protected by its ignorance and degradation from all risk, and if it is not, why-no matter; but science and skill in any department of real usefulness which they are obliged to fill, would be the horriblest sort of a horror in this exquisitely proper world of ours. By the way, how fortunate it is that the dandies, like the mobs in times of shocking innovations, always resolve themselves into committees of public safety; and how delightful it is to hear the one swear that they will defend the morals and manners of society against all radical reforms, and the other lithp the philothopy of thocial conthervatithm and inthitht upon maintaining the harmonieth of the thrferth for the protecthion of the thexth. 
                  Now we propose, in our rude way, to leave the decision of this, and all similar subjects which concern them, to themselves. La, gentlemen, it is a matter of propriety and womanly delicacy; and if women cannot determine that, it does not make much difference what becomes of them, for we have trained them up to that, "and nothing else;" and besides, we have left them scarcely any other of their own affairs to manage. It is their SPHERE, gentlemen, their only sphere; pray don't cut it down to a hemisphere for them. Our civil, political and business institutions, you know, have, with the most cautious consideration of their natural incapacities and improprieties, kindly classed them with infant, idiots and nigger, and given them no other compensate than the privileges of LADIES. 
                  Think of this and allow them exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of feminine delicacy. Or if that is too much to concede to the whole sex, confine your impertinence to ladies that are ladies, and nothing else, and let women take care of themselves. 
                
                
                  THE SCIENCE OF NESCIENCE. 
                  HOW they do talk! The reviewer of new works for the National Intelligencer, noticing "The Philosophy of Sir William Hamilton," lately published in New York and Washington, blows up this latest metaphysical bubble in this fashion: "Before his (Sir William's) brilliant qualities have paled the stars of Reid, Stewart, Brown, and the other philosophers of the Scottish school, as also Cousin, the apostle of Rationalism in France, together with the visionaries of Germany-sages who, in theology, believe everything but the Bible." 
                  This is the author's achievement, generally stated. The same thing has been said of every one of the above-named stars-and every whit as deservedly-that has in chronological order, or disorder, paled before its successor, and all together now before Sir William. In other words, "This is the cow with the crumply horn, that tossed the dog that worried the cat, that killed the rat, that ate the malt, that lay in the house that Plato built." All of which is true of the past, present and future, too, for the end is not yet. 
                  The reviewer, in the next paragraph, goes two steps forward of this position, as we understand him. He thinks that "This is the priest all shaven and shorn, that married the maiden all forlorn, that milked the cow with the crumply horn." He says: 
                  "The work before us is distinguished not only for its excellence as a metaphysical system, its profound thought and recondite learning, but also for its accordance and harmony with the principles of revealed truth; and, indeed, true philosophy will be ever found the most useful auxiliary of theology." 
                  Let us see how the priest (philosophy) all shaven and shorn, marries the maiden (religion) all forlorn. The Reviewer puts it thus: "Sir William appears an amiable man, and blandly states his invincible ignorance on many points. In truth, it may be laid down as a philosophical axiom, that the highest knowledge is a consciousness of our ignorance, and that humility is the cardinal virtue, not only of revelation, but of reason." 
                  And Sir William himself is quoted for the confession or assumption-for it has the humility of the one and empty boast of the other in it-that "The recognition of the rule of prudent nescience would save much false and presumptuous reasoning, equally discreditable to philosophy as to theology. Many things in theology are to be believed, not understood." And he instances "the futile attempts to harmonize by human reasoning such antilogies as foreknowledge, predestination, the free will of man, and the grace of God." 
                   
                  Call you that backing the book? Is that the way that, the maiden draws the "sincere milk of the Word" from the metaphysical cow with the crumply horn? We have heard before that metaphysics is dry, and think it is about time to let that heifer go to-grass. 
                  But this, and all this, is not the worst of it. Not only can this auxiliary or handmaiden of theology, metaphysics, do nothing for her mistress, and very little for herself, besides owning up to her invincible ignorance, but the reviewer serves up the difficulties of the Bible itself in the following doggerel: 
                         
                           "This is the book where each his dogma seeks, 
                           And this the book where each his dogma finds." 
                        
                     
                   
                  Now, our idea is, that as long as Christian Philosophers (save the mark!) keep up this senseless gabble, proclaiming in their way that "ignorance is the mother of devotion," it is not to be wondered if infidels say the same thing, with all the sarcasm that there is, substantially, in the saying. The fellow that said "it is the sum of wisdom to know that we know nothing," had just discovered that he was an ass, and left everything else to be discovered by other people; or, he was a philosophical puppy, that hoped to be astonishing if a paradox could make him so; at least, this is true of those who are always mouthing it after him. 
                  The Intelligencer's reviewer will please to understand that we mean no special or personal application of our remarks to him. We did not intend in any such way to distinguish him. He is only regarded and treated as the exponent of a tribe of fogies in philosophy that we are very tired of; and if he is up to the trick, will blandly smile in the sublime consciousness of that pompous nescience which distinguishes the sentimentalism of his set from ours, and so let it pass. 
                
                
                   
                  QUARRELS AMONG THE CRIPPLES. 
                  IT is bad to get a tumble on a pavement, or upset in a buggy, or in any way to get a broken arm, black eye, or burnt finger-they hurt, more or less, at the time and embarrass a body afterwards; but, if anything is worse than another, it is the endless explanations one is obliged to make, and the gossip that he must listen to about the way the thing happened, and how it might have been avoided, and who was to blame, and what a fool he was not to see and foresee everything that happened in the scrape. It is torturing to be so worried with one's own reproaches, and irritating, to suffer the lecturings and philosophizings of every happy fool, who seizes the occasion to display his after-the-fact wisdom for one's mortification; but it becomes excruciating when several have been involved in the catastrophe, and some of the sufferers turn upon others and criminate them with their unintentional agency in the mischief. A coachman who overturns a load of passengers has enough of it in a broken leg, without the complaints of a dozen insiders, two on the box, and all the stage agents and proprietors on the whole route besides. In the great West a more generous spirit prevails. There, whenever a steamboat blows up and sends half a hundred hoosiers into kingdom come, the survivors invariably call a convention on the shore and pass half a dozen resolutions unanimously acquitting everybody and everything concerned of all blame in the matter, and if they have cash enough left, give the captain and engineers a complimentary dinner. 
                  We suggest the example of this Mississippi magnanimity to our democratic friends, generally and particularly. That they bungled their last political job abominably cannot be concealed, and need not be denied; but they should leave reproaches to their enemies, and cultivate the kindest spirit among themselves. The watching, the wake, and the funeral are sorrowful enough, without post mortem examinations, and coroner's inquests, and other ugly insinuations of foul play and bad practice. 
                  Finally, we advise the Hunker sufferers to lick each other's sores as gently as they can, and we will do the amiable by pouring in the oil and wine, and lending them our own hobby as soon as they are fit to ride. We have hopes of the Hunkers, in the certainty that the next change must be for the better.

                  MOBS. 
                  MOBS are often made up of materials very fit for the purpose in view; but it is remarkable how little courage and conduct they generally exhibit. We have witnessed two firemen's riots, that made noise enough for a fight between an earthquake and a thunder-storm, but there was not a man hurt. One of them came off in the night, and we could not get a satisfactory view of the affair, but the other was got up on a fine summer afternoon; the parties were well matched, the field was fair, and brickbats, and paving stones abundant. The fellows fought for an hour, and we really believe there was not a wound made. In fact nothing can equal the pretensions of some of these assemblages, except their poltroonery. It may be, however, that there is often a more respectable difficulty than cowardice in the way-certain other misgivings, the restraint of the better sentiments. A mob that has a respectable grievance to redress generally shows courage and rises toward the tone of a rebellion. It is a pity that people, when they do return to first principles, don't organize better, and put the argument upon better instruments of reform than bones and muscles. 
                  Unprincipled violence is the same thing, intrinsically, in a mob and in an army; in the one case it is a popular ferment, in the other it is the same elements crystallized. The difference must be looked for somewhere else than in the form. A rumpus and a campaign may be very much alike; indeed, we cannot see why they are not equally entitled to chaplains and glory. We have no such respect for the authorized fraud and force of orderly society, as to regard the spontaneous outbursts which they sometimes provoke, with any very peculiar abhorrence. As long as respectable people continue to choke criminals, and blow the brains out of men, women and children, whom they call their enemies-calling the one justice and the other patriotism-they must expect the same things for the same reasons, in a rough irregular way among themselves. People in good earnest or in a passion don't stand upon formalities,-they aim at the thing. There is this difference in favor of mobs, however: as they do their killing without the warrant of law, they are more open to the remonstrances of conscience, and more capable of repentance for their brutality; and that is in fact the reason why they are often less determined in their wickedness, and therefore more ridiculous in their performances. 
                  We have quite a theory of our own about mobs, but as it is rather a peculiar one, and not very palatable to people who have enough to bear without our impudence, we withhold it. 
                
                
                   
                  "WHO CAN TELL A MAN WHAT SHALL BE AFTER HIM UNDER THE SUN?" 
                  MR. WEBSTER was hardly buried till Sumner, a Free-Soiler, was returned from the Marshfield district to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention; and now, Breckenridge, a Democrat, is elected by a large majority, to represent the Ashland of Mr. Clay in Congress. Already the places that knew these men know them no more! How fond great men and their admirers are of ascribing their reverses of fortune to fate! It preserves their dignity in defeat-just as little men attribute their losses and bereavements to Providence. It is a grand thing to be taken in hand by Omnipotent power! If a fly might choose, it would doubtless prefer the throat of a whale to the meshes of a spider's web. How slyly Shakspeare quizzes this fond conceit of fallen greatness, in that pompous piece of melancholy moralizing which he puts into the mouth of Cardinal Wolsey: 
                         
                           "This is the state of man: to day he puts forth 
                           The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms, 
                           And bears his blushing honors thick upon him; 
                           The third day comes a frost, a killing frost; 
                           And, when he thinks, good easy man! full surely 
                           His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, 
                           And then he falls, as I do." 
                        
                     
                   
                  He had ventured to navigate the ocean upon a bladder, to be sure; but when it broke under him, why, it was the state of man, not a blunder and disgrace of the individual. Solomon, too, and with good reason, anticipated just such a crash in the fortunes of his kingdom, and forestalled the world's judgment by working the melancholy and the defence of the inevitable catastrophe into a proverb: "To him that is joined to all the living, there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion." A little of the royal growl in that; but there is no help for it, for "the dead know not anything, neither have they any more reward; for the memory of them is forgotton. Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun." 
                  Just so it is generally, and just now it is so very particularly. Never did a generation of great men die so dead as those have done who ruled us twenty years ago. All gone, and with them their parties, policies, and prospects. Gen. Pierce is the newest man of the new times. The nephew of his uncle is nothing to him. He only displaced the new to restore the old. Pierce's nomination surprised him. His destiny will surprise him more. He is the first president of a new era. By the bye, who is to be the next great man of the South? Has South Carolina got anybody in training? Has Virginia anybody to train? We don't mean men of the Rives, or Cobb, or Walker kind, but somebody that will give history and precedent the cut direct, and undertake the fulfilment of prophecy. Let us venture upon a prediction. The bolder the better and more probable. Here it is. 
                  The next decidedly great man of the South will be an EMANCIPATOR! Don't "stagger at the promise through unbelief." There is nothing else for it. Everything else is worn out, and this is already wearing in. Some child already born will have this greatness thrust upon him, and our eyes shall see it. The South lies now like the Sleeping Beauty in the fairy tale, dreaming of her early glory, mingled with visions of her coming restoration. Some gallant young Knight of the Lion will wake her up presently; the sorceries that enchain her shall be dissolved, and she will queen it again over all the continent, as it is her right, in virtue of her eminent fitness to do.

                  HARD-MOUTHED REFORMERS. 
                  WHEN we first got out of the mixture and among the peculiars, we innocently expected that a set of good fellows whom society had kicked into coventry for the same cause, would feel for each other all the kindness of kindred sentiments and sufferings, and behave themselves accordingly. We expected to get into a brotherhood!-Never mind. We had before tried Church-fellowship in the same expectation. No matter about the results. But there is one thing interesting about sects, parties and associations, organized for special reforms-they fight like thunder. Each party mounted upon its particular cloud pours its fire into its neighbor cloud, simply because their electricities are not well enough balanced to be quiet; and the hottest is always given to the nearest. 
                  Fighting has some science and symmetry while the parties are fairly opposed, but when they are near enough to embrace each other, if they had a mind to, they get into gripes and go to biting and gouging. Moral repugnance, it seems, like physical repulsion increases as the squares of the distance diminish. We once saw two cats tied together by the tails and thrown over a pump handle; you may depend upon it, they made the fur fly. There was a great deal of human nature in that cat fight; and we ought to have expected a little among the special partners, in the business of world-mending mending. We forgot to mention that the "horrible infants" round that pump-handle got some rich fun out of the fury which the cats showed in "the glorious cause." It was very wicked, no doubt, but it was a fact, nevertheless. The little rascals felt the arousing sympathy of their rowdy chivalry, and suffered none of the scratching. Some of them wanted to untie the combatants, but that turned out a hard bargain for the pacificators. At last a big bully cut the string with a jack-knife; down they came, each on his own part of the "platform," but although they were both cats as plain as could be, they were cats still; and we left them with some disgust, in the firm belief that they wanted to fight. 
                  Heigh, ho! the analogies of a pump! They seem very marvellous in our eyes. And there is some fun in them, too; for wherever there is any good left, there is a little of that in it. 
                  N. B. In our own proper person we have got next to none of the scratches; and the sport to us is not the least bit curdled. 
                  We have been looking about for something big enough to be good humored, and strong enough to be serene; something that would comprehend all these segregated severalties, embrace and harmonize them, as integral manhood takes in all its members and keeps them in healthful peace. When we find it, we will let our friends know. If they find it first, we would like to hear from them. In the meantime, let us work at the fragments with the feeling that they must all go together at last, and ought to be kept comformable to that hope. 
                  Grim enthusiasts may be in some doubt about the earnestness of our fanaticism. They are mistaken. It isn't humpbacked, but it is of the heartiest. We could make these grisly old "pioneers of unpopular truth" laugh at themselves with a story, if we had a chance to tell it in Irish at a tea-party, where all the surroundings were in tune, and the story could be served up in its own gravy. But, alas, it won't tell itself on paper; we must wait for some hospitable opportunity to do it justice, or till some grumbler who trundles his whole cargo of reforms before him in a wheel-barrow, undertakes to crowd our locomotive with its whole train off the track. 
                  The trifling gipsy that danced John the Baptist's head into a charger wasn't a good one, but ten chances to one, he would have shaken it very doubtfully at the more liberal and general reform which replaced his own, if it had been left a little while longer on his shoulders. 
                  We have a great respect for prophets, but there is some reason why they have to drop off when they are ripe, besides the wickedness of those who throw clubs into the tree whose leaves are for the healing of the nations. 
                  If it were not a sin to say so, we would venture the opinion that martyrs are often monsters-mules-a cross between the slave and saint, with the toughness, obstinacy and infertility, too, of the hybrid races. 
                
                
                  SCISSORS AND SENTIMENTS. 
                  DURING the war which brought Charles the First, of England, to the block, the friends of that monarch were called Cavaliers, and the friends of the Parliament, or the rebels, were called Round-heads. It is said that this name arose from the Puritan party cutting their hair by putting a round bowl or dish over their heads and clipping their locks by the edge or brim of the bowl. The Cavaliers among other vanities wore their hair handsomely, or at least, they aimed at taste and beauty. The Round-heads were more remarkable for metal than manners. They were rough moralists, but earnest and exact ones. Their opponents needed the lesson set them by the men of the Commonwealth. Kingcraft has never been the same thing since that day. There is a great deal in the way hairs are cut and split. 
                  By the way, it is wonderful how the eccentricities of the age run to hair. Go into any odd squad of world-menders, who are engaged in settling the everlasting principles of everything upon an immutable basis, and the first things that strike you are the horrors and heroics of hair; curls that endure, and moustaches that defy the woes and tyrannies of time, and shirt collars which lie open to all eternity. Conservatism, on the contrary, girds its throat careful and tight in starched cravats, generally white; and wears its hair, beard and whiskers, in the most orderly conformity to the standards of fashion. 
                  Do these respective styles speak, in their different dialects, the characters of the parties which they dress and adorn? Are they the symbols for "going it with a looseness," by the one set, and for standing up starched and stiff-necked for order and authority by the other? A leather medal to the man who will resolve us the puzzle. 
                
                
                  THE TWO GREAT PARTIES. 
                  THE dumb instincts of "democracy" are scarcely felt in the old hulk. A change has come over the spirit of its dream; the charm is broken, and the fierce spirit of individual liberty, which has been so long held in by the discipline of party drill, and the instinct of gregariousness, is now asserting its natural tendencies. 
                  A herd of wild buffaloes, rushing headlong over hill and plain and plunging through morass and flood, so close packed as to trample each other to death, has seemed to us an apt illustration of the force and blindness of the party tie of "the old democracy." It was very amusing to see the whole herd, from the oldest bull to the silliest calf, following the lead of some supple aspirant, without any qualification for his place but his agility. Once fairly under way, they would run on in a circle with as desperate energy as if they were really going somewhere; stoutly maintaining their grotesque gravity, bellowing and blowing like a prairie storm, in full chase of their own tails, and looking for nothing but the old hoof-marks. 
                  And what a curious variety of make and bearing there was among them! Some of them, beef to the heels; others, so bony that it would make your teeth chatter to look at them; and others again, so spruce, and pert, and glossy, and the hump on their backs so softened down and symmetrically subdued, that you were puzzled to distinguish them from the tamest specimens of domesticated whiggery. Still they all crowded in the same gang, and the slickest among them were always in the best clover, and the doggedest broad-horns always deepest in the mud. 
                  We began with a very different drift, but the figure forces us into philosophy, and we cannot avoid the suggestion, that the hierarchical order of society must certainly be the natural. The broadest coil of the spiral is always the lowest, and supports the pressure and affords the spring of all that stand above it; and the highest-the apex of the cone-is the most diminutive and delicate of the whole series. So democracy always tapers up into dandyism, and stands firm and steady upon its broad butt-enders. 
                  Whiggery, which is all artificial, and made up for effect, and which is nothing positively, but only the opposition to democracy, naturally enough, is never satisfied unless the cone is inverted. Oh, it takes it to "stoop to conquer." It is never in such raptures with itself as when, in silk stockings and ruffles, it is mixing up the public mortar with its morocco boots, with a log cabin at the head of the procession, and a coon-skin stuffed with straw, or an old horse collar, hung at the gable end. It is the "upper ten" that go it with a rush like bursting, big, burly fellows for Rough and Ready. White kids and cologne water do so adore the rugged and tough in human nature! There is an exquisite antithetic tenderness in this, very like the gossamer enthusiasm of milliners' 'prentices for big fists and bristled beards. 
                  
                     1848.
                   
                
                
                  THE WHIG PARTY. 
                  THERE is a mystery in whiggery that no good whig can possibly unravel. They are not the worst party in the world, and they know it. They have a very high opinion of themselves, their measures, manners, men and money, and a corresponding contempt for dirty shirt democracy and the loco foco lazaroni. To accommodate the groundlings, they often "stoop to conquer" quite as low as they think necessary; but they are not good enough, and don't know enough to succeed. Whenever, by some odd turn in the wheel of chances, the whig stock rises, and things look a little promising mising, they invariably bring out Henry Clay, and talk such floods of nonsense about his "gallant heart" and "indomitable soul" as their new proselytes can neither endure nor forgive, and straightway, whig stock is down again at a dismal discount. 
                  Just now, they have been coquetting with the Quakerism and conscience of the country in great swelling words of virtuous repugnance to the manner that the war was brought about by Polk, and they even salted their party slang with a little grain of Anti-Slavery; but they did not venture to denounce the war itself, nor pledge themselves for its discontinuance. They expressed no repentance for voting its supplies, and did not intimate that their majority in the next Congress will stay the waste of life and treasure which the war still threatens to continue. They were the first in this city to howl for revenge against the Mexicans for the first skirmish on the Rio Grande. They were guilty of indecent haste in nominating General Taylor for the Presidency on no other ground, real or pretended, than his earliest victories in this same "infamous war," and for no reason on earth but to steal away from the administration its vulgar popularity, that they might use the position for their own purposes afterwards. 
                  Everybody knew that in heart and soul they scorned the men, but not the means, by which they hoped to repair the bankrupt fortunes of their idol candidate; and when all these absurdities, hypocrisies and follies have failed of their design, and discredited the little good there is in them besides, they don't understand it!! 
                  Why shouldn't loco-focoism beat them? If it is rough, it is also strong, and in all its coarseness there is a rude earnestness that gives it the full use of all the soul there is in it; but whiggery has neither the courage of a good conscience science, nor the audacity of a dull one. It is all the time detecting its own meanness, and behaving as if it felt it. Its dignity represses its zeal, and its pretensions reproach its practice. It has not got the grit to go the whole length of a principle, and it is not quite profligate enough to abandon it utterly. If they were either cold or hot they would sit better upon the public stomach; but as they are, if the whale happens to swallow them in the hurry of a storm, they are sure to be thrown up again, to fulfil their mission of preaching panics and prophesying destructions, which never happen. 
                  We don't know what became of Jonah, but we recollect that Nineveh was not destroyed. The prophet, though useful enough in his way, was discredited by the event, and was moreover so much disgusted that he fainted outright. Alas, for Jonah! If he had gone straight forward and done his duty, he wouldn't have been voted out when the ballots were cast. Jonah was a prophet and a panic-maker, and a storm-raiser, and didn't quite believe his own story, and didn't manfully say and do what he knew to be truth and duty; and so, he got into scrapes. Jonah was a whig in his way, and that's the reason that nobody knows what became of him. 
                  WHIGGERY tolerates all sorts of sentimental heresies in its Northern politicians and editors. It is the party's policy to embrace every diversity of opinion and every fragment of organization which agitation divorces from its rival. It has a spark-catcher and damper for every locomotive on the track of reform. It believeth all things, it hopeth all things, it endureth all things. If loco-focoism excommunicates a faction of its malcontents, whiggery is ready, from its boundless less assortment of sentiments, to meet the accident and exert the attraction of its affinities. If earnest democracy impels a detachment of its disciples to advance beyond its old party lines, whiggery overhauls its capacious conscience, and easily finds a parallel principle, and insists upon a conjunction. Anti-masonry, national reform, antirentism, native Americanism, have all been tried by its sweet seductiveness, and some of them have been softly sucked in and incorporated. 
                  Its own body is perpetually falling to pieces or flying off in fragments-crumbling at the heart from dead inactivity, and splintering on the surface from the rapidity of its revolutions; and it is ever exhibiting the fractured surfaces, showing how exactly they fit, and pleading for re-union. The assortment of these old sores and new faces is so complete that it can prove a relationship to everything, and is in fact all things to all men. It has no particular function, form or effect, and has a great deal too much to do ever to accomplish anything in time. It is exactly like Mr. Tittlebat Titmouse's parliamentary bill, a promise to give everybody everything, expressly got up for the canvass, and like that illustrious type of its own character, it never does anything after its election but crow. 
                  There is one thing-only one thing-that maintains its existence,-it supports the whig ticket. It preaches its principles, all of them, but postpones the performance of those that are conscientious. It abandons its friends to purchase its enemies; it compromises, while it professes, everything to secure the form of success, and its divergent energies always explode at the very instant of consummation. Henry Clay is called its embodiment. He is one of its embodiments. He embodies its worst inconsistencies and its most malignant antagonisms. Horace Greeley is a better one; he embodies its philanthropy, morality and democracy. He opposes slavery, war, capital punishment, aristocracy. He is earnest, simple, generous, noble; a religionist, a reformer, a man, but, he is a whig, and all his liberty of heart and head is lost; he is "bound" to support slavery conservatism, feudalism, oppression, war, murder, in the person of General Taylor, if he receives the nomination of the Whig National Convention. How beautiful the ruin-how vile the catastrophe. We love thee still, Horace, as we have loved Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. There was enough good in these to make a dozen angels, there is enough of evil to ruin as many devils. 
                  Everything means something, if one had but the gift to understand it. It is unphilosophical to dispose of a puzzle by calling it a humbug. Whatever comes into existence has some design in it, and so soon as it becomes utterly useless it forthwith goes to pieces. There are "sermons in stones," hard subjects as they are, and "good in everything" however difficult to find it, and the whig party must be and mean something. Our apprehension of it is this; the nature and providential drift of our institutions gives us a democratic government, and in practice demand democratic functionaries. The creed and the discipleship must, in the nature of things, be kept in some tolerable degree of correspondence. In Natural Philosophy and Theology there may be parties antagonizing each other both in theory and in action, because first principles are in dispute, and there is no authoritative expositor; but the doctrines and policy of our civil government are matters of convention, and construction by the proper authority is absolute and certain. There can, therefore, be but one legitimate, permanent, or substantive party in politics, but there may be any number of temporary, adjective sects, through whom non-conformity and abuses are to be exposed and remedied. 
                  The whig party, we take it, results from this necessity, and is legitimately devoted to this reformatory function. Its fortunes and history accord well with this view. The democratic party holds the government from the proprietaries in fee, and the whig party has a sort of tinker's lien upon it for repairs. Once in a dozen or twenty years, when the democrats, in the presumption of an indefeasible title, behave so badly that they cannot endure themselves any longer, the whigs find their true usefulness in helping the best of them to turn the rascals out of office. But the whigs thereupon make the egregious blunder of imagining that they are a party, instead of a patch for the regular one. 
                  The conduct and action of the whigs sustain the same view. While the democrats are always preaching principles, they are always exposing abuses, and complaining of mal-administration. It is tyranny, not usurpation, that they charge upon their antagonists. And it is owing to the fact that they are essentially a reform party, though they neither know the fact nor wish it to be so, that they are able to appeal, as they always do, to the progressive and better sentiment of the country with plausible claims upon its support. They always behave a little better on the questions of peace, anti-slavery and the right of petition than their rivals, but they mistake their office. Because they physic and plaster the diseased body politic, they take it into their heads that they ought to be received as the head of the family and the manager of its affairs. If they could once get it fairly into their heads that they are only a "segregated association" of disgusted democrats, and conduct duct themselves accordingly, they would truly answer their providential purpose; but this thing of setting up for a regular, permanent, independent and integral organization, puts them entirely out of harmony with the established order of things, and converts what would otherwise be a symmetrical movement into a miserable shuffle and a confounded fuss generally. 
                  In 1844 the insane democracy would annex Texas, to which nobody had any particular objection, except for the imminent mischief of the Mexican war and the growth of the slave power. The whigs, true to their blind instinct of reform, took grounds against it, but false to their destiny nominated a slaveholder whom no earnest wise man could trust, with the principle aim of aggrandizing their party and securing special legislation for the benefit of particular classes. 
                  They were not satisfied merely to prophesy ruin and preach repentance, but they would make provision for broker shops in the temple. Accordingly they failed. But having proclaimed anti-slavery doctrines all over the North to satisfy their own consciences, and to secure and reclaim the adhesion of better, because more single-hearted men, they came out of that campaign, defeated of their sinister object, but greatly strengthened in their moral sentiment, and irrevocably committed to the non-extension of slavery. 
                  The leaders generally meant nothing of all this, and neither calculated the consequences nor recognized them; and when they came to Philadelphia last June, they had not the grace nor the light to perceive that they had cultivated the discipleship into an unmanageable anti-slavery bias. If they had known what and where they were they would have broken with the South at the first word and thrown themselves bodily into the current which they had created. They perceived ceived the difficulty of their position; they could not retreat; the pressure behind would not allow that; and they were neither good nor brave enough to advance, so they concluded to stand still and cry for help. 
                  They had made it impossible by their last four years' labor to disavow the doctrines which the whole North had adopted, and the South, which would not tolerate them, demanded the compromise of silence. So the National Convention kicked the bottom out of the boat, and there they are hanging to it by their eyelids in the most forlorn exposure to the tide that is sweeping under them. 
                  It is all true that they have voted and talked better in Congress on the Mexican war, Texas annexation, and slavery questions than the other party; and the same may be said of them in the long-fought battle for the right of petition; but it is just as true that they never voted quite well enough to do any good, nor talked quite well enough to be heartily trusted by people who knew their duty and wanted nothing but the opportunity of performing it. 
                  Pending the struggle for the right of petition in Congress the Northern Whigs gave more votes for the right than did the Democrats; nevertheless, the question was not carried until after they had lost their majority in the House. They talked against the war but they voted the supplies. Texas was admitted by the defection of two of their bolters; and their brethren of the South are so dead set for slavery extension that the Oregon bill was saved by two Democratic Southern votes! 
                  They are exactly good for nothing as a reform party in legislation, because they aim, beyond their function, at the administration of the country, and to effect this take in the incongruous element of Southern whiggery, which always nullifies the real good which is in them, and can never give success to the mere party aims which they persevere in maintaining. 
                  In the last conjuncture of circumstances in which they embarrassed themselves, by their abandonment of all their principles and desertion of all their men, they have shown themselves as unreliable for mere party purposes as they always have been for the great objects of national reform.

                  LACHRYMOSE HEROICS. 
                  GENERAL TAYLOR has had a triumphal entry given to him by the city of New Orleans. Banners and arches, trumpets and guns, beauty and eloquence, were all put under contribution, until the eyes that never blinked on the battle-field or moistened over its carnage, gushed out with the gratification of personal vanity. The enthusiasm of the popular homage is the only thing that, in these times, can move great statesmen and great heroes with the softer emotions of humanity. 
                  Mr. Clay cried right out at Cape May last summer. General Taylor is expected to go forth weeping through the Southern cities, and the sympathizing New Yorkers have invited him to drop a tear or two, with the proper ceremonies and circumstances, upon their patriotic dust, so soon as he is prepared to shed them there. Of course, we also may expect to have an affecting time of it, one of these days, in Quakerdelphia. It will gravel our Mayor a good deal to assist at such a ceremony if the General is to be his candidate; but in May, 1846, he bawled himself hoarse, calling for revenge against the Mexicans, and he must honor the instrument, when the time comes, though it may happen to cut both ways. The Philadelphia Sun calls for an invitation to the hero from the city authorities, and announces, besides, several preparatory balls, meetings, and rejoicings, and a couple of "eloquent orations to be delivered in the Callow-hill street CHURCH(!) on the life, character, and battles of General Taylor." 
                  Mob hurrahs and church hosannahs will keep each other in countenance, and righteousness and peace may kiss each other behind the door, if they like, but must not court in the pulpit or the pews. This is a great country, and an interesting portion of Christendom at that. 
                  The ladies of Lexington gave Bibles to the soldiers of Captain Clay's company, to balance the bowie-knives designed for the bowels of the Mexicans; and some of our church-bells rung glorification chimes for the victory of Buena Vista. Religion, sliced very thin and highly polished, makes the finest of all veneers for national villainy; it is not quite so glossy as glory, but it has a deep, rich lustre, that commends it to the most correct and cultivated taste. 
                  The Fourierites say that civilization has already culminated and is rapidly running down to barbarism again; and, that religion is disembodying itself and leaving humanity to rot. We had brighter hopes for our country, but if its people are to be systematically educated backwards into the spirit of a vulgar heroism and brutal violence, as long as the brood of Mexican murderers lasts, the promise of its greatness may yet suffer a dismal disappointment. 
                  
                     January, 1847.
                   
                
                
                   
                  CALOMEL. 
                  IT is not a regular education that maketh the doctor to differ from the quack. We have often heard a renowned physician of the last generation quoted for the saying that when he did not know what to give he always gave calomel, and another for a similar oracle: "If I were called upon to state what particular medicine has done most good in my practice, I would answer, ammoniated julep, without a moment's hesitation;" and still another, who writes that he has" never known the volatile tincture of gum guaiacum to fail in one of ten thousand cases suited to its exhibition." This is just the rationale of the horse doctor and nostrum vender-they give their prescriptions, because they are "good for the disease." Whatever teachers mean by such talk, and however their own incommunicable tact and experience may guard them from the abuse of such excessive generalizings, the pupil who hears and adopts them will kill his patients by the score in his blind reliance upon them. About twenty years ago, Dr. Cartwright, of Natchez, made himself a sort of flash military fame by the daring use of calomel in three hundred grain doses. He published a bulletin list of cases in the victory style of proclamation, and one of the earliest results that fell under our notice was that of a country physician who lost the half of his under jaw by following the advice in his own case. 
                  We knew a physician once to recommend camphor in a bad case of fever, because, he said, the article is a first-rate febrifuge! This man had a large practice. Iodine was once used by the profession generally in the simple belief that it promotes the absorption of tumors; and bark was as generally employed in convalescence from fevers, because it is known to be a tonic. In the use of drugs, physicians often prescribe them for the name of the disease, just as do the veriest empirics. Calomel is in universal use by the indolent and incapable, because it is known to be an alterative, and they harden themselves against the teachings of their own practice by treating the popular dislike of the article as a popular prejudice. There is no quality of a fool so dangerous as his professional pride. Not one in a dozen practitioners know what effects this Samson of the materia medica is producing in the system of his patient till its extremest power is discovered by salivation. Then they think they have done their best for the case, and feel sure that the mercurial fever which they have induced will resolve itself in its own way, and the patient will recover. 
                  The community has learned from the profession that mercury is an anti-bilious medicine of certain efficacy, and the profession understands it to be a specific in affections of the liver generally. A case will illustrate the effect of this gross notion. 
                  A very respectable practitioner treated a case of abdominal dropsy, which supervened upon a cronic ague, with calomel, till complete salivation was established. The patient's head, face, and tongue were swollen excessively, the saliva flowed in a continuous stream, and its odor was perceptible all over the house. The doctor had been attending the man at intervals for two years, and was certain that torpor of the liver was the cause of all the symptoms. Calomel-the specific-was therefore pushed to its utmost, until every secreting organ of the body was excessively excited except the liver-the particular one he was aiming at. But, said he, calomel is a specific in torpor of the liver, and, therefore, he renewed the attack with the same agent. The liver must be roused if the head should be blown off in the effort. This is regular quackery. 
                   
                  The patient, a rugged laborer, was unable to swallow a tea-spoonful of any fluid, when the doctor called our preceptor into consultation; and if the circulation had been supplied with lava and every nerve tipped with friction matches, the poor fellow's fever would scarcely have been more infernal. An aqueous solution of gamboge was administered drop by drop as the patient could swallow it; the biliary secretion was well awakened-the man recovered, and the doctor ever afterwards believed that gamboge was a specific in torpor of the liver! If he had been brayed in his own mortar, nothing but fool powder could have been made of him. 
                  Quackery! If a fellow's head is a fog-hank it isn't in a diploma to make a physician of him. The man that can't tell the time of day by a clock till he hears it strike has no use for a watch; and the physician that does not know whether calomel is producing its effect until his patient is salivated, should never touch the drug-he is not fit to use it. 
                  It was the profession that banished cold water from the bedside of the sick, and created an ignorant prejudice against its use as a remedial agent. We recollect cases in which an enlightened physician did not dare to use it as a bath till he had medicated it with a table spoonful of vinegar, or brandy, or some mysterious looking drug. For, if the patients had died, he would have been blamed with killing them, and if they recovered, the whole country would have thought it a miracle, and regarded him as a dangerous experimenter. 
                  The doctors are not yet done with the trouble which this prejudice gives them; and they will not soon recover from the just alarm which their abuse of mercury has produced in the public mind. But they will retrieve their credit when they reform, and people know that they have quit concealing their use of it, and lying about it. 
                   
                  Mercury is, nevertheless, worthy of the highest place in the confidence of the physician; but blockheads had better let it alone. They would do so, if the public would let them alone. 
                  By the bye, it is not a little curious that men are generally regarded best fitted for the practice of medicine who are fit for nothing else; and as soon as any of them discover ability in other walks of science and literature, they become unpopular as practitioners. A little touch of the supernatural is still required in the trade; just as witches are made out of silly old women, and Indians select the biggest humbugs in the tribe for their great medicine men, so doctors must not be quite natural people, and if the super or extra can't be had, the infra-natural will do as well. 
                  Upon the whole, people are as well served as they deserve, or at least, the economy of existence requires that ignorance shall suffer as well as sin. Providence has something else to do than to work miracles for fools, and they would be nothing the better for constant interpositions even if they were afforded. Whatever is, is right; at least everything is about rightly related to everything else, and that comes to the same thing. 
                
                
                  MEDICINE. 
                  THE profession has much to be proud of-more than the uninitiated know of. We cannot speak of the science of theology, and feel modest about the legal profession, but we are safe in saying that the achievements of mind in the various departments of medical study are even distinguished among the labors of the human intellect. 
                   
                  The healing art is now in a grand transition stage. Empiricism, in a dozen forms, is putting the diploma tribe upon the defensive at all points, and will mend the faculty in matter and manner. Sects which have arisen within the ranks, and perished after a brief battle for reform, have done it much good. The Broussais school, too extravagant to be sustained, nevertheless abated the mischief of the atrocious system of purgation, so much in vogue twenty years ago. And the Herculean remedies have been cut down to moderation by popular opinion, suggested, probably, by the doctrines of Hahnemann. Water-cure will waken the doctors up to the use of principles well known in the profession, but neglected under the fashion of drug prescriptions; and even mesmerism will teach them more than they knew before of the influence of mind and morals in ministering to the sick. And there is music, too, totally neglected as a medical agent. Oh, there is much to learn as well as to unlearn, and quackery has a respectable vocation and a useful office in persecuting the hunkers into perfection. Those of them that are good for anything, will profit by the conflict-"the collision of errors elicits truth." 
                
                
                  DR. GEORGE McCLELLAN. 
                  WHAT has become of all that George McClellan knew of surgery; does it, in any degree of completeness, survive him? He was the bravest and best thinker that we have known in the profession. He was made on purpose to improve it. As an operator he might be matched; but Dr. George had genius. The boys to whom he delivered his inspirations, of course, could not receive them. They did not know the difference between his teachings and the horn-books of the trade; generally, they know too little of the commonplace information in the books, to receive the higher teachings of such minds as McClellan's; and for want of the formalities and mannerism of made-up people, he could not impose upon them with things above their comprehension. He had a glorious Irish nature and a complete Yankee education. There can be no better material and method for making a man. He is dead-who shall take his place? The enthusiasm of our pupilage has passed away, but the memory of his true greatness deepens with the lapse of years. It would be grand larceny to own him so much and acknowledge nothing. 
                
                
                  COLORED ORATORS. 
                  A CORRESPONDENT of the New York Tribune gives his impressions of the Colored Men's Convention, which met at Rochester on the 6th instant, July, 1853, in a tone and in terms of admiration which cast into the shade all that is reported of the President's progress from Washington to New York with the ceremony and celebration of the Crystal Palace opening, besides. Something must be allowed for the writer's surprise, and something subtracted for his enthusiasm; but his instances and illustrations go very far to support his estimate of the character, talents, and conduct of the assembly. Indeed, the fine qualities of his own style of thought and utterance are no mean proof of his competency to form a just judgment in the premises. He names Douglass, Day, Remond, Woodson, Reason, McCune Smith, Pendleton, Green, Gaines, Langstone and some others, as distinguished among their fellows for abilities as speakers, and whom he thinks could not be matched in the average by the Legislatures of any of the States, nor by either of the existing Houses of the Federal Congress. This looks like piling it up pretty high, and will probably carry little weight with those who know nothing of the men he speaks of, and less of those with whom they are compared so much to their advantage. Our own opinion, if we could raise the courage to avow it, might serve as an endorsement in blank. We have heard and felt Douglass, Remond and Woodson; and for opportunity of comparison we have heard a few of those renowned orators whom we would scarcely be allowed to name in such connection-men of the first rank in the pulpit, at the bar, and on the stump, and-but, may be, we had better not. 
                  Well, the first time we heard Douglass, then, was at Pittsburg, nine years ago and more. Mr. Clay was in the Senate, Mr. Webster was Tyler's Secretary of State, Walter Forward was Secretary of the Treasury-he was at home on a visit at the time, and was sitting in the seat beside us that night. Douglass was a chattel personal of one Mr. Auld, of Maryland, at that time, and under the laws of our happy country, a fugitive from service and labor. Mr. Clay was saying "that is property which the law makes property-two hundred years of legislation have sanctioned and sanctified negro slavery;" Mr. Webster was demanding restitution from the British Government for the slaves that had escaped from the Creole. Mr. Auld stood upon his vested rights; and there stood Douglass upon the springboard of his wrongs-if space could have been annihilated, as pretty a conjunction of men and things as one could desire for a dramatic tableau! Calhoun, too, was alive, intensely alive, that same night. 
                  Douglass put them all upon the stage before us as really as Shakspeare could have done it then, or the Witch of Endor now. Half an hour we held our places, fidgeting at first, then frightened into the cutting consciousness of a somehow participated culpability in the villainies charged home upon our Constitution and our color; then, carried out of ourselves, exchanging those quick glances that telegraph the unknown depths of men's spirits compelled into the light, till time and space and every law of mortal matter yielded, and we swept away into that strange region where inspired thought clothes itself with ideal forms, and not a pulse or breath breaks the enraptured vision. 
                  There in that charmed atmosphere the magician reared the National Capitol, opened the Senate Chamber, and represented to a miracle the men that we had thought were without a model or a shadow. 
                  It was even terrible to our sympathies, so deeply enlisted, to witness the daring of that unlettered slave, attempting the personation of Clay, Calhoun, and Webster, in action, thought and utterance. Gracefully athletic in his flow of thought as Clay in his happiest mood, when he presented him arguing the right of restitution-terribly concentrative as Calhoun in vindicating the international obligation, and-ponderously logical as Webster, in expounding the doctrine of the demand. His astounding power of transformation, his perfect clearness of discrimination, and his redundant ability in the execution, more than justified the audacity of the attempt. To see one man with all the varied capacity of these three, mixing them up, without confusion or mistake, in the puppet-show of his imagination, and playing upon them at his pleasure, was verily a sight to see. But the bitter burlesque of the American Eagle, with the Secretary's missive tucked under his wing, pouncing down upon the British Lion and screaming in his ears, "not those words of mortal terror to the tyrant beast-all men are free and equal, so ruefully remembered; not that dreadful battlecry-Free Trade and Sailors' Rights, to start his recent wounds afresh; but-but-I want my niggers!" That capped the climax; and we have an earnest doubt if any man in that assembly has lost a tone of that wondrous voice, or a tingle of the nerves, which he touched with pain, and shame, and rage, and ridicule, that night. 
                  Well, we haven't a word more of our own to say about it; but when we had got to Mr. Forward's door on our way home, and had fairly recovered self possession, we turned very quietly to him, and asked-"What do you think of it?" His manner had ten times the force of his words, for he chose only to say-"That, sir, is the highest style of Virginia eloquence; and, to say the least, the very best example of it." Mr. Forward had been in Congress every now and then for twenty years, and was himself the finest public speaker in Pennsylvania. That's all. 
                  Our own notion of the man keeps trying to run out at our fingers' ends; but, as we are no authority at all in such a matter, it is withheld. We take leave to say, however, that the Southern men who talk contemptuously of "Fred. Douglass" have some excuse, and we do not even wish that the best of them should ever suffer the consequences of an encounter with him-that were more than they probably deserve; but the Northern snobs, that know better, are perfectly aware that they are talking such blasphemy as mediocrity can commit against genius when they speak contemptuously of him. 
                  By the bye, it is a point which a little experience, with a reasonable capacity, puts beyond a question, that these niggers, as a class, beat us all hollow in oratory, in every case where the parties are anywhere nearly equal in what we call intellect and attainment. That is their advantage as a race; and any white man of Anglo-Saxon blood that does not know it, will catch a defeat when he ventures on a trial. 
                  This proposition, or the idea of it, was the thing we aimed at when we commenced this article; and we make it the conclusion of our remarks, as it is of our judgment in the premises. 
                
                
                  MR. BASCOM-WESTERN PREACHERS IN THE OLDEN TIME. 
                  REV. HENRY B. BASCOM preached last Sunday in the Hall of the House of Representatives at Washington. He had an immense audience. This sounds to us like a revival, not of religion, but of Henry B. Bascom. In our boyhood, long time ago, Mr. B. was the eloquent preacher of the United States for the great West; but for twenty years, almost, he has been among the missing. Glad to hear of him again. We shall never forget the first sermon we heard from him. It was preached in the Methodist Church on the corner of Smithfield and Seventh streets, Pittsburg. His theme was the Divinity of Christ. The evidence of miracles was, in part, produced in this style: 
                  "An ordinary man?!-An angel announced his incarnation to Mary and legions of them shouted his arrival upon Earth;-An ordinary man this?! An ordinary man?!-At Cana of Galilee, the subject elements owned him NATURE'S God, and the water at his bidding crimsoned into wine;-An ordinary man this?! An ordinary man?!-At the grave of Lazarus, he cried "come forth," and obedient putrefaction trembled into life;-An ordinary man this?!" 
                   
                  We cannot by our punctuation indicate the elocution of this passage, nor convey our idea of its power upon the audience; but we remember well-we yet feel the effect is produced upon our child fancy. And when he gathered together all his energy of thought, gesture and expressive pauses (which latter he employed with greater effect than any other speaker that we have ever heard), to express his apprehension of the intrinsic, underived divinity, affirmed in the passage "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again, illustrated in the act of the resurrection, we saw a large number of the congregation rise nearly to the upright attitude, in unconscious sympathy with the effort and act, exhibited, rather than described, by the orator. 
                  Dryden versified the miracle of changing the water into wine, thus: 
                        "The conscious water saw her God, and blushed."
                      This is only pretty, compared with Bascom's majestic presentment of the entire argument, the whole philosophy of the interference, which he designed to draw, in power parallel to the poetic beauty of the imagery employed. 
                  The sermon was about an hour and a half in length, and the passages given are samples of its style throughout. Bascom is a Kentuckian, or was before he became a Doctor of Divinity. He was a circuit preacher in his boyhood, and got the very best part of his education among the Indians. And not the least important part of that was his preeminence in athletic exercises. At twenty years of age he was famous among them as a wrestler and runner. The education of the physical man was not neglected. In his best days he was no more liable to dyspepsia or bronchitis than was St. Paul. The very idea of any sort of sickness, less than rheumatism, or a respectable inflammation of the lungs, or brain, would have made a Methodist preacher laugh himself into convulsions in those days of primitive itinerancy. But Bascom, the brave young Harry Bascom, that had at least a dozen Kentucky race horses called after him, has become a Doctor! A title that has some allusion to theology indeed, but sounds woefully significant of the pill box too. 
                  What a grand work those rude heralds of religion did in the wild west! Providentially fitted to their mission their, agency in forming the social character of the people cannot be over-estimated. People talk about qualifications for the ministry! In those days it was bone and muscle and lungs first, and theology afterwards, as might happen. Punctuality in keeping appointments when cow-paths must be threaded, and rivers forded, and an occasional thumping encountered, were ministerial virtues that outranked every other qualification which now makes up the standard character. We feel a little doubtful of the acceptance of this gossip, but are in the vein to illustrate with a couple of anecdotes. 
                  We once heard a rugged six footer, who lived at the mouth of one of the gorges in the Alleghany Mountain, ascribe his conversion to the exact regularity with which the Methodist preacher on that circuit rode past his smith shop in all weathers to an "appointment" which he had at a log cabin "away up the creek," where he preached once in two weeks to a dozen people-in the barn in summer time, and in the kitchen in bad weather. "Dang it," said he, "I began to think there must be something past common in it, when he stuck to it so, and got next to nothin' for it. So I went up to see; and, thank the Lord, I got stopp'd in my mad career." That phrase, "mad career," being the hickory-withe poetry in constant use to describe the reckless wickedness of unconverted mountaineers. 
                  The other story:-Old Jacob --, Rev. Mr. -- now, perhaps, for he is living somewhere Down East, "had an appointment" a mile or two north of the Conemaugh river, near its head-a little thunder-gust stream that would rise in a freshet ten or fifteen feet in as many hours, and run dry again almost as quick. He reached the southern bank one day when the river was behaving its very worst. The people on the other side called to him that it was above "ridable order," and he "mustn't ventur." But Jacob had his appointment to keep, and as his rule was no "postponement on account of the weather," he did "ventur." His horse was strong and his heart stout, and the river was not very broad; but it was a little deeper and wickeder than he had contracted for. Near the opposite shore the tide was too much for him, and he began to go down stream rapidly; the current drifting him toward an eddy that was raging like a whirlpool. He saw it and made a vigorous effort to grasp the branch of a tree that hung over the swollen water. It broke in his hand! and the chances seemed desperate. Firmly grasping the pummel of his saddle, he cried out in his stentorian preaching tones, "Lord, thou hast promised to be with thy servants in difficulty, and it is pretty near time to do something." The next moment he was rolling in the waves and thrown against the bank. The folks who had warned him against the attempt quickly fished him out, and after a little more rolling and shampooing on the shore, "he came to." His first words were, "Now, if I had my horse, it is still time to keep my appointment." 
                  The little congregation that had gathered from miles round got their sermon, and Jacob went on refreshed and happy to his next "appointment." 
                  Times are changed and we are changed with them. But things that are things, however changed, are always adapted to their use, and we will not regret even the virtues lost that are not now demanded, if their place is supplied by those which correspond as well to existing things. 
                  
                     1849.
                   
                
                
                  REWARDED ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS. 
                  THE Southern Whig papers have been zealously occupying themselves for some weeks in getting up lists and writing brief political biographies of such of the Barnburners of 1848 as have received appointments to office under the Pierce administration. The feeling with which this is done is obvious enough; but to what end, in which they have any party interest, we do not perceive, unless it be merely to keep themselves in material for growling, and under the patriotic delusion that they are doing something for the country by the mere fact of opposing the Democratic party. The Democratic organs, first and second fiddles, drums and jewsharps, are attending to the complaint, however, and to purpose. 
                  The policy of these appointments by the Executive is semi-officially explained thus: General Pierce has certain great national principles to maintain, and certain party pledges to redeem, which make it imperative on him to pursue a course by which every element of strength may be saved to the party. The factions, which for some years before had kept the party at variance, in the last Presidential campaign returned to its support, and did good service in the field, by which that great and crowning victory was obtained; and it was wise to give them all a fair chance to stand by the platform hereafter, as zealously as they adhered to it during the canvass, for they will be wanted in all their force before long. Besides, one of the ways of killing a dog is choking him with butter, and if the Barnburners shall, in any event, prove refractory, the sting of their resistance will be plucked out by leaving them no hold upon popular sympathy. They will then not have been driven away from the support of the intended movements of the Administration, and compelled to array themselves with the enemy; and if they turn out tender of conscience again, or recreant to their contract duty, the branding iron of the Government will throw a blush around the burn, which will color the appeal they may make to public judgment, in such fashion as will check the display or destroy its effect. 
                  The English Government used to have three ways for disposing of Irish patriots-hanging, exiling, and promotion-the latter decidedly the best, when it would take. The after management of the reclaimed strays is well put in the following extract from the "National Democrat," of New York. It fairly exhibits the probation to which the repentant sinners are put. "Says the spider to the fly" in the net- 
                  "The removal of all who show the cloven foot of Free-Soilism is, we believe, a fixed fact. And if they cunningly hold still for the sake of keeping the spoils, then the faction is deprived of many of its leaders, and we shall have the laughable sight of the body and tail of a party in the field without its head. Those free-Soilers who have sought and obtained office under this Administration, have tied their own hands and feet, and sealed their own mouths, for four years, at any rate. Or, if they break loose again, they will be hurled from every post of honor, and will become marks for the gibes and contempt of the people. There is not a more damning thing to a faction than Government patronage unfairly and falsely obtained. A powerful faction in this State has tried the experiment most thoroughly, and it has hanged itself on a gallows of its own cunning device." 
                  The way of transgressors is hard enough, but under the Pierce dynasty it is nothing to the way the prodigal sons are to be served after they have tasted of the fatted calf, dressed to welcome their return. To our taste, the husks of the third party had a better relish and a pleasanter digestion. The elder brethren who never left the household are evidently the chief cooks of the entertainment, and serve it without grace. 
                  The Hunkers remember 1848, and so do we. Those were the days when we went gipsying with the Prince and the pious Butler. It is amusing now to recollect that we have seen John mobbed, as nearly as four or five thousand indignant Whigs and Locos could achieve so laudable an undertaking. It is really funny to think of his quantity of piety being persecuted; and to look back at his sufferings for conscience's sake as an actual fact! We fancy we can hear him now, as then, delivering the oracle, "There is such a thing as being right as well as regular!" John, you are immortal, but-as a wag. 
                  We have made out our own pardon for believing that when good motives for right conduct were as plenty as blackberries, you had some of them. You are a good-looking fellow, and, for a little while, had the benefit of good company; but, it is of no avail for you to get right again; better, on the whole, for all honest men, that you stay regu- 
                     lar. And as for brother Butler, we recommend him also to keep out of revivals, and stick to "stated preaching." If you are treated with contempt and suspicion by your present political associates, it will not add very much to the burden of your own; so we leave you to your luck; and don't let your consciences trouble you in the last. Repentance is not a grace for them and for that place where there is no reformation possible. We have fed upon the crumbs that fell from your table, and owe you something for a few helpful licks, and would willingly dip the tips of our fingers in water to cool your lips when you get into torment, but for the width of the gulf. Prayers for the dead don't reach beyond purgatory. We must hide our grief in our own heart, for it is not lawful to send our good wishes all the way after you. You have become National Democrats; and, "to give the devil his due," we consent and submit; but our humanity shudders at those fierce extremes of heat and cold that are in reserve for you. 
                  And now, that our sympathies are flowing freely, where is our old friend, Tom Corwin, of glorious memory? The last thing we recollect of him, personally, happened in the Western Reserve, in 1840-a long time ago. That day he performed one of the most capital dodges that we have seen done, even on the Western stump. There were a few Abolitionists among the twenty thousand auditors that he was playing upon for his own and General Harrison's election; but they wanted to vote for Old Tip anyhow, and, as they say in Pennsylvania, "never let on" about his pro-slavery votes, duly recorded in the Abolition almanac of the day. The Locos, however, were well posted up about it, and if they could only get the Governor to say something about it, one way or the other, they had something to make by it. For, if he came out flat-footed against the Abolitionists, he would lose them; and if he pleased them, he must offend hosts of "good Whigs and true." 
                  "Tom"-that is, the Honorable Thomas Corwin-had just made an effective pause in his oratory, and was taking a drink, when a frosty-faced, slab-sided Locofoco, six feet and an indefinite number of inches high, rose about the middle of the mass, and stretching himself up like a jack-screw, letting out one joint of his back bone after another, until he stood a head and shoulders above the crowd, cried out in a voice that might split a gum stump, "What do you say to Abolition?" Tom-his name was in such constant use that it had to be shortened for convenience-Tom, taken all aback, and not a loop-hole left for escape, looked around for a moment in honest distress, which served better than acting it for his purpose, and letting it first take its true effect, put on the roguery required, and when every eye was blazing on him, and every heart standing still with expectation, he covered his face with both hands, leaving an out-look for his eyes between the fingers, and in a tone of exquisitely done-up mock embarrassment, cried out, "That's not a fair question to put to a man of MY COLOR." 
                  Tom is doubtless as comely, morally and politically, as the curtains of Solomon, but he is, nevertheless, as black, complexionally, as the tents of Kedar. The effect was immense, and the impertinence of the Democrat was drowned in an explosion of applause. 
                  But what a difference there is between exploding a joke in the woods and a bomb-shell in the Senate Chamber! The last we heard of him, after that volcanic eruption, was that he ran away to escape from the falling fragments. We hope he is not hurt, for there isn't a better agitator alive. From painting rainbows to lading out lava, and for mixing logic and laughter, fun and philosophy, with effect, he has scarcely a match in the Union, however bounded. Ah, Prince John, and Governor Tom, we could better have spared better men (for we had plenty of them), and you shan't want an epitaph while word of ours may do you a grace. 
                  
                     1853.
                   
                
                
                  HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN! 
                   
                     
                         
                           "But yesterday, the word of Csar might 
                           Have stood against the world; now lies he there, 
                           And none so poor to do him reverence." 
                        
                      
                   
                  IN 1840, Corwin was absolutely irresistible. Two years ago he was ripening rapidly for the presidency. Then he made his Mexican speech and shot clean out of the sphere of availability. That day he stood before the Senate like Daniel's image, in excellent brightness and the form thereof was terrible; the head was of fine gold, the breast of silver, the thighs of brass, but the feet were partly iron and partly day. Under a temporary inspiration, his inmost soul was opened, and he delivered a message above his own comprehension and purpose. Better for him if he had not known the truth, than thus to throw it out and then run away in terror of its strength and beauty. 
                  There is a crisis in every man's life who is meant for greatness, when the invisible things are opened to him, and then he either bravely crosses his Jordan or is ordered back to wander in the wilderness, mingling with the common crowd, till "his carcass is wasted by the way." The disobedient prophet is sure to be thrown overboard by the sailors to appease the storm which he raised. Corwin, forgetting his patriotism in a swell of broad-breasted philanthropy, invoked for his marauding countrymen a welcome with "bloody hands and hospitable graves" in Mexico. That will never be forgiven to him; and his practical and pitiful recantation in the late canvass, forfeits the sympathy and respect of that high sentiment to which he first appealed, but afterwards betrayed. Alas, how many are called and how few are chosen! 
                  Every man sent to the world with a high purpose is taken up into his mountain to be tempted, and if he there forgets that man cannot live by bread alone, his life loses its meaning, and the miracle subsides into a miserable mistake for ever. 
                  
                     1848.
                   
                
             
             
                
               FANCY. 
                
                
               FANCY. 
                
                  ENCHANTED BEAUTY. 
                  A MYTH. 
                  THE mythologies in which the faiths, philosophies and fancies of the world have taken form, have such truth and use in them that they endure, under corresponding changes, through the reformations of creed and modifications of ceremony which mark the history of natural religion throughout all ages and countries. The essential unity of the race, its kindred constitution of mind and affections, its likeness of instincts, passions and aspirations, naturally account for the under-lying agreement in principles and central similarity of beliefs, which are traceable clean through, from the earliest to the most modern, and from the most polished and elaborate eastern, to the rudest northern, opinions. The nice transitions of doctrine from the infancy to the maturity of faith and philosophy, are marked by an answering variance in their significant ceremonials; but, however mingled and marred, the inevitable truth is imbedded in all the forms of fable, and, under an invariable law of mind, the inspirations of fancy correspond in essentials to the oracles of revelation; just because human nature is one, and its relations to all truth are fixed and universal. 
                   
                  Creeds and formulae, like the geological crusts of the earth, at once retains and record the revolutions, disintegrations, intrusions and submersions from which they result. In the long succession of epochs, whole continents have risen from the deep, and the vestiges of the most ancient ocean are found upon the modern mountain tops; promontories have been slowly washed away by the ceaseless waves, and new islands have shot up from the ever-heaving sea. Through the more recent crusts the primitive formations frequently crop out upon the surface of the present, and the comparatively modern, in turn, is often found fossilized beneath the most ancient; dislocated fragments are encountered at every step, and icebergs from the severer latitudes are found floating far into the tropical seas. Nevertheless, through all changes of system, revolution has been ever in the same round of celestial influences and relations, and the alterations of form and structure have been only so many different mixtures of unchanging elements, from the simple primitives to the rich composite moulds, into which the waters, winds and sun-light have, in the lapse of ages, modified them. The constancy of essential principles, through all mutations of systematic dogmas, is strikingly manifested. The law of adaptation links the material globe and the rational race, which occupies it, in intimate relations; and the universal unity in the great scheme of being establishes such correspondences of organisms and processes with ideas and ends, that the symbolisms of poetry and mythology are really well based in the truth of nature, and the essential harmonies of all things are with equal truth, under various forms, embraced by fiction and fact, fable and faith, superstition and enlightened reason. 
                  "The true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world;" "the grace that hath appeared unto all men;" and "the invisible things of the Creator, clearly seen and understood by the things which are made," are propositions which have the formal warrant of our sacred books to back the authority of rational demonstration. Moreover, it is pleasant and profitable to believe that "He hath not left himself without a witness" among any of the tribes of men. The human brotherhood is so involved in the divine fatherhood, that the individual's hold on the Infinite and Eternal must stand or fall with the universality of His regards and providence. If Canaan had been without a "Prophet of the Most High," if Chaldea had been left without soothsayer and seer, and classic Greece and Rome destitute of oracles and Sibylline revelations, the Jewish theology and the Christian apocalypse would stand unsupported by "the analogy of faith," and our highest hopes would be shifted from the broad basis of an impartial benevolence, to a narrow caprice of the "Father of all Men." But, happily, the sympathies of nature, the deductions of reason, and the teachings of the Book, are harmonious on this point, for we find Melchisedec, who could claim no legal or lineal relation to the Levitical priesthood, the chosen type of the perpetual "High Priest of our profession;" and Balaam, notwithstanding his heathen birth and ministry among the Canaanites when their cup of iniquity was full; and the eastern Magi, who brought their gifts from afar among the Gentiles to the new-born "King of the Jews," all alike guided by the same light, and partakers and fellow-laborers in the same faith with the regular hierarchy of Mount Zion. So, the Star of Jacob is the "desire of nations," and the heart and hope of the wide world turn ever toward the same essential truth, and strive after it by the same instinct through a thousand forms, "if haply they may find it." 
                  The religious system of the Jews and Chaldeans agreed, with wonderful exactness, in the doctrine of angelic beings, and their interposition in the affairs of men. The superintendence of the destinies of nations and individuals, and the allotment of provinces, kingdoms and families among these ministering spirits, are as distinctly taught in the book of Daniel of the Old Testament, and in the gospel of St. Matthew of the New, as in the popular beliefs of the Arabians and Persians; indeed, the Bible sanction is general, particular and ample, for the doctrine of angelic ministry, as it has been held in all ages and throughout the world. 
                  The order and organization of these celestial beings, among whom the infinite multiplicity of providential offices is thus distributed, falling within the domain of marvellousness and ideality, of course, took the thousand hues and shapes which these prismatic faculties would bestow; and in the various accommodations and special applications of the doctrine, it naturally grew complicated, obscure, and sometimes even incoherent; but in all the confusion of a hundred tongues, kindreds and climates, a substantial conformity to a common standard is apparent enough to prove the identity of origin and the fundamental truth common to them all. 
                  It is to introduce one of these remarkable correspondences that these reflections are employed. 
                  Fairy tales, it is said by encyclopedists, were brought from Arabia into France in the twelfth century; but this can only mean that that was the epoch of the exotic legends. In England, if they were not indigenous, they certainly were naturalized centuries before Chaucer flourished; and they were as familiar as the catechism, and almost as orthodox, when Spenser wrote his Fairy Queen, and Shakspeare employed their agency in his most exquisite dramas. But their date is, in fact, coeval with tradition, and earlier than all written records; and their origin is without any necessary sary locality, for they spring spontaneously from faith in the supernatural. They are inseparable from poetry. That priesthood of nature, which enters for us the presence of the invisible, and converses familiarly with the omnipresent life of the creation, recognizes the administration of an ethereal hierarchy in all the phenomena of existence; they serve to impersonate the spiritual forces, which are felt in all heroic action, and they graduate the responsive sympathies of Heaven to all the supernatural necessities of humanity. 
                  The live soul can make nothing dead; it can take no relation to insensate matter; it invests the universe with a conscious life, answering to its own; and an infinite multitude of intermediate spirits stand to its conceptions for the springs of the universal movement. Rank upon rank, in spiral ascent, the varied ministry towers from earth to heaven, answering to every need, supporting every hope, and environing the whole life of the individual and the race with an adjusted providence, complete and adequate. In the great scale, place and office are assigned for spirits celestial, ethereal and terrestrial, in almost infinite gradation. The highest religious sentiments, the noblest styles of intellect and of imagination, and the lower and coarser apprehensions of nature's agencies, are all met and indulged by the accommodating facility of the system. 
                  The race of Peris, of Persia, and Fairies, of western Europe, hold a very near and familiar relation to the every-day life of humanity, by their large intermixture of human characteristics and the close resemblance and alliance of their probationary existence and ultimate destiny to the life and fortunes of men. A commonplace connection with ordinary affairs and household interests constitutes the largest part of the popular notion of them; and their interferences among the vulgar are almost absurd and ludicrous enough to impeach the earnestness of the superstition, but our best poets have shown them capable of very noble and beneficent functions in heroic story. Like our own various nature, they are a marvellous mixture of the mighty and the mean, the magnanimous, the malignant and the mirthful; they stand, in a word, as our Correspondents in a subtler sphere, and serve to illustrate, by exaggerating, all that is true and possible in us, but more probable of them-our own shadows lengthened and our own light brightened into a higher life. In some countries the legends are obscure, in others clear, but they all agree well enough in ascribing their origin to the intermarriage of angels with "the daughters of men," and that they are put under penance and probation for the recovery of their paradise. So, like our own race, they have fallen from a higher estate, their natures are half human, and their general fortunes are freighted on the same tide with ours. 
                  The nursery tale of the Sleeping Beauty will serve capitally to illustrate our theme. Handed down from age to age, and passed from nation to nation, through the agency of oral tradition chiefly, it has, of course, taken as many shapes as the popular fancy could impart to it; but the essential points, seen through all the existing forms, are substantially these: 
                  A grand coronation festival of a young queen abruptly opens the story. The state-room of the palace is furnished with oriental magnificence. The representatives of every order, interest and class in the kingdom-constructively the whole community-are present to witness and grace the scene. The fairies who preside over the various departments of nature, and all the functions and interests of society, are assembled, by special invitation, to invoke the blessings and pledge the favors of their several jurisdictions to the opening reign. The ceremony proceeds-the young queen is crowned; the priest pronounces the benediction, and the generous sprites bestow beauty and goodness, and every means of life and luxury, until nothing is left for imagination to conceive or heart to wish. But an unexpected and unwelcome guest arrives-an old Elf, of jealous and malignant character, whose intrusion cannot be prevented, and whose power, unhappily, is so great, that the whole tribe of friendly spirits cannot unbind her spells. Neither can she directly revoke their beneficences; for such is the constitution of fairy-land that the good and evil can neither annihilate each other's powers, nor check each other's actions; and their active antagonism can have place and play only in issues and effects. The good commanded and dispensed cannot be utterly annulled, the profusion of blessings prepared and pledged cannot be hindered in their source or interrupted in their flow, but the recipients are the debatable ground; they are, within certain limits, subject to the control of the demon, and the end is as well attained by striking them incapable of the intended good. The queen and her household are cast into a magic slumber until (for the Evil will be ultimately destroyed by the Good) an age shall elapse and bring a Deliverer, who, through virtue and courage, shall dissolve the infernal charm. The blight fell upon the paradise in its full bloom, and it remained only for the youngest fairy present, who had withheld her benefactions to the last, to mitigate the doom she could not avert, by bestowing pleasant dreams upon the long and heavy sleepers. A century rolls round. The Knight of the Lion undertakes the enterprise-encounters the horrible troops of monsters and foul fiends which guard the palace-overcomes them-enters the enchanted hall, and wakens the whole company to life, liberty and joy again. The knight is, of course, rewarded with the love he so well deserves and the hand he has so richly earned. 
                  This is obviously the story of the apostacy and redemption of the human family, in the form of a fairy legend. It conforms closely to the necessary incidents of such a catastrophe, and answers well and truly to the intuitive prophecy of man's final recovery. In substance and method the correspondence is obvious. Every notion of "the fall," whether revealed or fictitious, assumes the agency of "the wicked one;" and the final recovery, universally expected, involves the sympathies, and employs the services, of the "ministering spirits," as important instruments of the happy consummation. 
                  This tale was presented as a dramatic spectacle last winter at the Boston Museum. The play, is a minutely faithful expositor of the legend; and it is by the aid of this fine scenic exhibition that I am able to adjust the details, of which the primitive story is so legitimately capable, to the answering points in the great epic of human history "as it is most surely believed among us." 
                  The parallel presented does not seem to me fanciful, and the circumstantial exactness of resemblance may, I think, be accounted for without supposing a designed imitation. 
                  Before tracing the specialties and their allusions, let us notice the general parallelism found between the pivotal points of the fabulous and of the authentic representations. 
                  The Bible Eden is introduced at the same stage of the story's action and in the same attitude to the principle characters of the narrative. It stands on the coronation day of its monarch, perfect in all its appointments; the realms of air, earth and ocean in auspicious relation, every element harmoniously obedient, and the garden still glowing with the smile which accompanied the approving declaration, "it is very good." Dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the face of the earth, is conferred; and the heavens add their felicities to the inaugural rejoicings-"the morning stars sing together, and all the sons of God shout for joy." The gifts are without measure or stint, and the Divine beneficence cannot be tainted in its source nor impeded in its efflux; but, the intended recipients, by "the wiles of the enemy," are rendered incapable of the enjoyment. The sin-blunted sense and passion-blinded soul of the fallen race are plunged into a spiritual stupor, which sleep-the sister and semblance of death-strikingly illustrates; and through the long age of moral incapacity which follows, the highest mode of life is but dimly recognized and feebly felt, in the dreams of a paradise lost and the visions of a millenium to come; till, "in the fulness of time," when a complete pyschical age shall be past, the Deliverer, having first overcome the wicked one, shall lead captivity captive, and by the "marriage of the Lamb" with "the bride which is the Church," perfect the redemption and bring in the new heavens and new earth. 
                  But-to the fable, the dramatic representation, and the interpretation thereof. 
                  The scene opens upon a rustic society, a hamlet, in the infancy of civilization, such as, upon ballad authority, was "merrie England" before the age of her conquests in arts, sciences and arms; and before the crimes and cares of her age of glory replaced the days of her innocence and contentment. Simplicity of manners, modest abundance, moderate labor, aspirations limited to the range of things easy of attainment, and, opinions comfortably at rest on questions of policy and religion, describe the rural life upon Monsieur Bonvive's domain. The master, in bachelor ease, superintends the simple affairs of his village; Madam Babillard, the housekeeper, has the necessary excitement without the anxiety of her post-just the amount of trouble that is interesting with the pigs, poultry and pets of the homestead. The girls, indeed, are too hasty in ripening into womanhood, and the beaux are Over-bold in their gallantries; but then, these are things of great consequence to her, and she is, through them, a matter of great consequence to the community, and the exercise of authority amply repays all its troubles and responsibilities. The affairs of the commonwealth take good enough care of themselves, generally; the people are happy in the enjoyment of what they have, and equally happy in the unconsciousness of what they have not; the holidays come at least once a week, and there is space and place for work and play every hour of every day. Good consciences, light hearts, and natural living, carry them along very happily, and they have enough of the little risks and changes of fortune to keep the life within them well alive. The wilderness upon which their village borders is known to be infested with hobgoblins and demons, and there is a current belief that in the centre of the forest there is a princely family bound in a spell for a hundred years, but they have never penetrated the mystery nor clearly ascertained the facts. 
                  Among these simple people there is an ancient dame, who was old when the oldest villager first knew her, and she has lived through all the known generations of men. Her whole life has been a continual exercise of the best offices among the people; she has been nurse and doctress, friend and counsellor, by turns, to the whole community, and they repay her with the love and veneration which her goodness and wisdom deserve. She is now apparently in the decrepitude of extreme age, but the frame only shows the marks of decay-the mind is as young and the affections as fresh as they were "a hundred years ago." She is the "Fairy of the Oak," the youngest at the coronation scene, and the tutelary spirit of the enchanted family. Ever since the hour of their evil fortunes she has inhabited a human form, performing the charitable offices of ordinary life and mitigating its incident evils: but, especially, she has been cultivating whatever of virtuous enterprise and aspiration appeared among the youth from generation to generation, directing it into the best service, and endeavoring by it the deliverance of the imprisoned spirits under her charge. Patiently and lovingly she has striven, earnestly and anxiously she has watched, every promise of a Deliverer that the race from age to age produced. Patriarch, prophet, apostle and philanthropist, has each, in his degree, done his own good work, and the world has been the better that they, lived; each has added another assurance of the ultimate success, but themselves "have died without the sight." Her own powers, and those of her auxiliaries, are vast and supernatural, indeed, but the championage of human redemption must be human, and she can but inspire, direct, sustain and guard the mighty effort. 
                  Now, a young Christian Knight, "the Knight of the Lion," famous for deeds of valor in Holy Land, gives promise of the great achievement to the quick perception of the Guardian spirit. She has aroused his enthusiasm and sustained his zeal, disciplined him by trial after trial, and trained him from triumph to triumph, for still greater deeds, which take continually more definite shape and more attractive forms in the dreams and reveries which she inspires, until he has grown familiar with the vision and conscious of its supernatural suggestion, and she is able at last to intimate the duty and the trial which invite him by songs in the air addressed to his waking ear. 
                   
                     "The enchanted maiden sleeps-in vain 
                     To hope redress from other arm, 
                     Foul magic forged the mighty chain, 
                     Honor and love will break the charm. 
                   
                   
                     Dread perils shall thy path surround, 
                     Wild horrors ranged in full array, 
                     Courage shall take the vantage ground, 
                     Bright virtue turn dark night to day." 
                   
                  Drawn westward by her art toward the scene of the great enterprise, he reaches the village on the border of the wilderness, and from the legend current among the rustics inferring more definitely the character of his mission, he accepts it in the true chivalric spirit of faith, love and hope. His Squire, or man-at-arms, who has followed him heretofore with an unquestioning fidelity, consents to incur the risks, though he has a very imperfect apprehension of the heroic undertaking. The devotion of a faithful follower answers instead of knowledge in his rank of service. He would rather encounter a dozen flesh and blood swordsmen than one ghostly foe; nevertheless, where his master leads he will follow, whatever the character of the fight. The Knight comprehends the nature of the conflict fully; it is not with flesh and blood, but with "spiritual wickedness in high places" that he has "his warfare." To him the great battle is not in the outward and actual, but is transferred to the inward and spiritual, sphere-into the real life-whence the ultimate facts of existence derive all their currents and ends. So felt the hero who said, in the great faith, "we have our conversation in heaven"-"we sit in heavenly places;" and so felt and thought the reformer who deliberately threw his ink-stand at the devil's head. The region of the ideal is the field of the highest heroism, and every life given to the world in noble service and generous sacrifice is lived in the spirit sphere, in familiar sympathy with the good, and constant strife with the evil, angels. This faith is the main impulse in all chivalric action. Even a heroic poem cannot be created without it. It cannot be false, for it differs nothing in the constancy and efficiency of its presence from the most palpable facts, and is proved true by the test of harmonizing with all other truth. 
                  The Knight personates the highest ideal of philanthropy; the Squire stands for the lower, more palpable modes of practical benevolence and reform. They are distinguished as widely as general and special providence-as the thorough emancipation of the soul, and the charity which relieves the body, or the whole difference between the apostleship of spiritual, and that of civil, liberty. They correspond respectively to the prophet Elisha, who saw the mountain tops filled with horses and chariots of fire, outnumbering and overwhelming the hosts of the Syrian king, and to his servant, who saw but two men, his master and himself, opposed to a numerous and well appointed army. 
                  Such is the difference between the Seer and the Servant in any labor or conflict of faith-in any enterprise which involves the spiritual forces that rule the movements of the world. Throughout the whole action of the drama the agency and deportment of the knight and his follower are marked by this distinction. 
                  But the scene shifts; and the sympathetic and corroborative movements in fairy-land are revealed. The Fairy of the Oak appears and summons the spirits of the air, earth, water and fire. The elements, disordered by the fall, and thenceforth at war with the poor fugitive from Paradise, must render their aid in his restoration, that when the last enemy is put under his feet, the material creation, cursed for his sin, may be renewed with his recovery, and the harmonies of matter answer to the sanctities of spirit. The Spirits of the material forces obey the invocation and cordially promise sympathy and service: 
                         
                           "Throughout all space-above, below, 
                           In earth or air, through fire or snow, 
                           Where'er our mission calls we fly, 
                           Our tasks performing merrily, 
                           Our guerdon winning happily." 
                        
                     
                   
                  The actors, human and ethereal, thus adjusted to their several offices: the Knight and his Squire enter the haunted wood-the Squire to struggle with the grosser forms of evil, some as ludicrous as sad, others as horrible as atrocious, and all odious, coarse and palpable; the Knight to be tempted of the devil, and do battle with him for the redemption of the enchanted family under his dominion. 
                  On the open front of the stage, darkened with smoke and foul with the offensive odors of noxious gases, the Squire is hotly engaged with the great dragon, in close rencontre, and at the same time assailed above, around, in flank and rear, by harpies, fiery serpents, and other forms of terror-the battle of life translated into coarse diablerie. The sentiment and significance of the play in this take great liberties with the regular charities and practical reforms of our social system. The sorts of evil which these monsters so uncouthly represent are such as physical suffering, drunkenness, violence, fraud, and the thousand shapes of slavery, personal and political, and of all castes and colors. They are represented as greedy and ugly, and full of mocking and malignity, but with little intrinsic capability of mischief, for they are really very unattractive in temptation and extremely awkward in battle, and much more remarkable for thick-skinned insensibility to assault, than for any adroitness in the combat. The Squire bravely deals his blows upon the great dragon. Horror, fear, and hatred of the monster, earnest devotion to the "great cause," with the courage of full commitment, and, perhaps, some regard for his reputation as a hard-hitter, put life and metal in his veins, and right lustily he mauls away. The earliest effects of his prowess are remarkable. The dragon, defending his own ground as confidently and angrily as if the empire of evil were really a rightful one, wherever sanctioned by antiquity of possession, dashes his ponderous jaws at the reckless agitator, opened wide enough to swallow him, with all his weapons and armor, at a gulp; but he manages to elude the clumsy wrath, and, nothing daunted and nothing doubting, deals his blows with energy in the ratio of the rage they arouse. Curiously, but conformably enough, at every stroke another ring of the monster's tail unrolls. At first he was an unwieldy, but not an utterly misshapen, brute; now, he has become a serpent and a scarecrow; the head and tail are as incongruous as the pretended righteousness of his cause and his villainous method of defending it. The strife goes on, and grows only the worse and wickeder for its continuance, till it is plain that the beast is not to be mastered with hard blows, and if he yields, it is because his huge, unwieldy bulk is exhausted with the protracted effort of defence, and he subsides at last rather than submits. 
                  So ends the battle, and then comes the triumph. The valorous victor, claiming all the honors he has won, mounts his sometime foe in the new character of hobby, and rides him grandly off the stage, in a blaze of gaseous glory, cheered most vociferously by the boys, and affording not a little merriment, mixed with admiration, to the old folks. 
                  What a figure that procession made! and how exact a figure, too, of many another that the world witnesses admiringly. The Squire is, however, none the less a hero that his principles are rugged, his method rude, his ideas a little vulgar, and his aims tinged, but not tainted, with egotism. The dragons, serpents and hobgoblins must be routed, and he is the man for the emergency. 
                  All the while this palpable warfare is proceeding in open view, the Knight is engaged with the subtler fiends, in the dim and doubtful darkness of the background. Quite behind the scenes the severest strife is maintained, but enough is seen and intimated upon the stage to reveal the real character of the conflict. The fidelity of illustration in the conduct of the allegory here was really admirable. At one time we descried him through the gloom by the flashing of his sword, engaged in hand to hand combat with a host of fiends, rushing upon the foe with true chivalric enthusiasm; at another, hard pressed and well-nigh exhausted, sternly enduring the blows he could not parry or repay-exhibiting, in turn, every mood of courage to do, and fortitude to endure, the varied fortunes of the field. But anon, with equal truthfulness of portraiture, he is discovered trembling in a sudden and strange panic, which shows the temporary failure of his faith, and seems to threaten his utter desertion of the field. 
                  In the open presence of the foe his courage never fails, but the stratagem of darkness and desertion successfully evades the sword-thrust and the shield's defence, and gives him up to doubt and desperation. The powers of darkness take hold upon him, and in his agonies of fear and suffering he would, if it were possible, that the cup might pass from him. In this moment of anguish and depression the Fairy of the Oak instantly appeared to strengthen him. With a touch and a word she reassured him, and the divine virtue again shone out, exposing visibly the demon of the doubt, and the good sword again flashed in the gloom, and the fiends, forced into open fight, are finally overthrown. 
                  Bulwer strikes the same profound fact of experience in heroic enterprise, in his "Terror of the Threshold." The reformer, however confident in virtue, and however assured of the goodness of his undertaking, naturally trembles at critical stages of revolution in opinions and institutions, long established and interwoven with the existing order of society; for the risk of introducing new truths may well check the current of a wise man's zeal. If I pull down, he will say, this temple whose ceremonial, though barbarous and blinding, yet supports the morals of the worshiper and the present order of the social system, will the liberty and light bestowed avail for the designed improvement; or will they only unsettle the securities of law, and prove occasions of disorder and licentiousness? The brave bigot and fiery enthusiast know nothing of this indecision. The cautious hesitation which springs from solicitude for the best ends and most expedient means, never troubles their stubborn bluntness of purpose, nor abates their boasted consistency of action. But the regular procedure of Providence is marked by regard for the influence of conditions and for the established law of progress. In these things the highest benevolence meets impediments and suffers modifications, and even submits to postponement to avoid defeat; and the agents and instruments of the world's regeneration have their Gethsemanes as well as their triumphs and transfigurations. 
                  Nothing in language, scenery or costume, irreverently asserted the allusions which I am exposing. I do not know that either playwright, performer or spectator was concerned about, or even conscious of, the significant symbolism of the fable and its circumstantial exposition in the play. It was produced as a beautiful dramatic spectacle. Apart from any mystical meanings, it was a perfect luxury of scenic entertainment. It was so regarded by the visitors, and probably was designed for nothing more; but to me the analogy was a surprise and a delight, growing at every step of the development. It struck me first when I saw the knight and his brave squire standing on the threshold of the enchanted hall, after their victory in the wilderness. With equal zeal, truthfulness and devotion they had battled with the formidable foe, but with very different aims and apprehensions. The difference was most manifest when they stood in the presence of the enchanted family. The Knight, breathless with awe, and melting with compassion, showed how tenderly and reverently he felt the moral and mental bondage which struck his open vision; but the Squire, though so faithful and loyal as a follower, and efficient as a servant, had yet not the penetration of a seer; and the preposterous spectacle of princes, counsellors, knights, esquires, priests, soldiers, pages, artisans, musicians, dancers, slaves, retainers-every class and calling among men-all arrested in mid-action, and slumbering for a century amid the luxury and pageantry of a gorgeous festival, with the viands untasted and the cup undrained before them, struck him with a comic wonder and pleasant sportiveness which he cared not to suppress. Approaching the venerable prime minister of the realm, who sat with the goblet near his lip, immovable as death, the thirsty soldier familiarly proposed to drink his health, and only made mouths at the cup when he found it "as dry as dust." The cheek of the dancing girl, who stood pivoted for her century upon one toe, he found "as cold as a stone;" and the apples offered by an African slave to a guest, whose hand hung arrested midway in the reach, proved to his disappointed taste a "petrified humbug." The whole scene of deprivation and incapacity before him he pronounced an epidemic sleeping fever, and he wondered if it was catching, and where and how he should get his dinner! 
                  All this has its parallel and exposition in the boys that mock a drunkard reeling through the street, and the contrasted sadness which a soul, alive to the moral ruin, feels at the same sight; or, it may be witnessed again in the conduct of an insensible boor, and that of a person of refinement, in the presence of the insane; and in general, in the sentiments of those who have, and those who have not, learned that "the life is more than meat, and the body than raiment." 
                  These reflections present themselves in the pause while the champion stands breathless with emotions of wonder and pity at the mingled gloom and glory of the scene. 
                  But the action proceeds again. A strain of melody spon taneously waking from the silence of an age, fitly preludes and prophesies the harmonies of the new era, and there wants only the "Talitha-cumi" of the Deliverer to awaken the princess and her household into the activities of full life. At the bidding of the minstrel he advances to her pavilion. Answering to his word and touch, she rises. One by one the women first resume their proper consciousness, and the revival of the men follows in proper order, till the spell is broken and the last shadow of the long night gives place to the perfect day. The renovated realm everywhere renews its primal beauty, the flowers of Eden bloom again, and the fruits regain their flavor, the wine is new in the new kingdom, and all the material ministries of life without respond the renewed faculties within. 
                   
                  The fable has not yet exhausted the facts. Obeying the poetical necessities of the epic story, and conforming also to the apocalytic vision of the world's fortunes, which are to follow the first victory over the dragon, and the binding of the adversary for a thousand years, we have the peace and happiness of the disenchanted household once more disturbed. The Prince of the powers of darkness, that great magician who is the author of all the mischief from the beginning, is "loosed out of his prison," and gathering all his forces for a final battle, he surrounds the castle. The queen's army, led by the knight, go out to meet the grand enemy in battle, and he is utterly overthrown and his power broken for ever. The conquerors return in triumph to the castle, and in the midst of their rejoicings a herald from the outer wall, who has witnessed the scene, announces the total annihilation of the enemy. The elements, marshaled by their ruling spirits, have overwhelmed him; a tempest of hail and fire bursts upon his castle, and the earth opening has swallowed up the last vestige of his kingdom and power. 
                  The battle of Gog and Magog (20th Rev.) in which the deceived of the four quarters of the earth are gathered together, and compass the camp of the saints about, is the very prototype of this incident in our story, and "the fire which came down from heaven," the "casting of the devil which deceived them into the lake of fire and brimstone," is only a different expression of the same final deliverance of the human family from the last enemy. 
                  The marriage rites close and crown the grand achievement, and a magnificent tableau illustrates the consummation. The spirits of the elements arise and array themselves in a vertical arch upon the stage. The centre and summit is occupied by a new figure, now first introduced, costumed appropriately in pure white, representing Truth inaugurated, or universal harmony; the Spirit of Earth at the base on one side, and that of Water at the other, while impersonations of Air and Fire occupy the intermediate positions. This bow of beauty and promise, emblematically dressed and decorated, stood a happy symbol of the restored order of the material creation. The household, artistically arranged and displayed, represented the divine order of society, where government and liberty, refinement and efficiency, luxury and industry, are reconciled, and man with his fellow man is organized in the harmonies of the creative scheme. And, that the joy may be full to the utmost limits of communion and sympathy, the Fairy of the Oak is seen ascending, to take possession, in behalf of her race, of their recovered heaven-the guerdon of their services to the redeemed family of Adam. So, the last scene in the drama mingles the new Heavens with the new Earth, and all the worlds in our universe triumph together in the general resurrection, as they rejoiced on the birth-day of the creation. 
                  I do not know the history of the fairy tale, its age or origin. I know nothing of the design with which it was prepared for theatrical representation, nor do I see why it; should be inferred, because the idea and method are so strikingly significant, that the manager, after the fashion of the ancient "Mysteries," intended to restore sacred subjects to the stage in allegorical disguise. I suppose that the fable is simply fancy's method of the great fact, and that its doctrinals are the natural intuitions and the inevitable theory of the human mind concerning the mystery of life, the great epochal experiences of the human family, its final fortunes, and the interests and sympathies of other worlds in its destiny; for such conceptions as these are general and common among all men. 
                  The question of special revelation is not affected by its concurrence with universally received ideas. The correspondence pervading all systems proves the truth, and unity of origin, of the essential points in all; but in no wise touches the method of their revealment, discovery or propagation. 
                  The points and particulars of the play are none of them manufactured to supply the running parallel we have given, nor are they nearly exhausted. Moreover, it will readily occur that the plan of the fable illustrates the whole philosophy of world-mending by its merely human heroes. The current and eventual progress of civilization, religion and liberty can be laid down upon its scheme in the exaetest detail of principles, which facts must follow and fulfil. The supernatural agencies introduced also answer this aspect and rendering of the myth. They well represent the material and immaterial forces concerned in all societary movements, and if they may not serve for the religion of the great process, they may do duty as philosophical abstractions, or as a beautiful system of poetical symbolism-for in the mystical correspondence of all these systems of ideas there is such fundamental unity of use. 
                
                
                  MY FIRST GRAND CONCERT. 
                  THE Musical Fund Society achieved the first and best of their three promised entertainments of the season, on Tuesday night-the best, for it is scarcely possible again to succeed as they did in their opening concert. 
                  We know nothing of musical science, we are totally ignorant of the terms of art employed in its criticism, and never heard a grand concert before. Imagine it,-an orchestra of fifty instruments, with the Labordes and Strakosh, bursting in all the glory of their power, as a great metropolis, on a high holiday, might open upon the vision of a mountaineer, carried blindfold from his cabin; or as the luxuries of Eden glowed and gushed upon the new-born faculties of Adam; or, as a dream of Elysium enchants the fancy of a child-so came the harmonies of that night upon our unpractised but enraptured sensibilities. The sense was concealed in an unknown tongue, but the soul of the sentiment spoke to our receptive sympathies in the familiar language of correspondence. 
                  Words sustain the commerce of thought, but music reveals the meanings of the heart. Is it rash for the untaught to judge? or presumptuous in the unskilled to enjoy? May not an infant smile when it hears the angels whisper, and exult when the splendor of the sky and the beauty of the landscape flood its spirit with delight? 
                  The orchestra mingled the dash of the waves with the rush of the winds, the thunder of the storm with the rumblings of the earthquake, the singing of birds and the murmur of the woods, blended yet defined, as the Creative Word breathed order into the universe, and rendered the discords of chaos into the harmonies of praise. 
                  The second overture surprised us into the consciousness of musical capacity-borne forward upon the wave, every note anticipated, every expression expected, the elements comprehended, the effect all felt, the simple distinct in the sublime, as the crystals in a gem-the influx came unquestioned and was enjoyed without a doubt. 
                  Strakosh wakened his instrument with a prelude which seemed to evolve the very substance of light and sound, spreading space for the reception, and a firmament for the display, of the forms of beauty which rose, note after note, in all the symmetry of science, but veiled in the wondrous witchery of art, until the very heart-strings vibrated under his enchanting touch; running up from the delicacy of a dream to the turbulence of a storm, through every phase of feeling, till we feared to be awakened again into our actual world. 
                  The Labordes, Monsieur and Madame, enacted their vocal prodigies in several exquisite songs. The execution of Madame Laborde, in compass and power, is absolutely perfect, from the most delicate tracery of a whisper, to the highest utterance of ecstacy. With a single trill of her wonderful melodies she interlinks the wildest outbursts of passion with the sweetest tones of tenderness. And what a prodigious mastery of sound! One moment binding up immensity within a whirlwind's girth, she gives it the utterance of a frenzied intensity; but, hush! as the thunder dies away in its cloud, the disembodied sound, in silvery sweetness, rising softly, floats away on the wings of a smile till the gossamer illusion is lost in a serene abyss of delicious silence! 
                  Her husband's singing, while it does not excel hers in variety, compass or force, is yet more graceful and by its deeper tranquillity and its greater freedom from apparent effort and consciousness of superiority, or, it may be, by its greater simplicity and naturalness to the uneducated taste. He has strength and volume enough to meet the demands of the passion; it does not drown the storm of the orchestra, and it has not the sharpness or fury which splits its way through the uproar; but alone in its quiet majesty, it has a rounded fulness that swells up to the measure of its pitch, sustained with all the assuring steadiness of unstrained power. The stream never rages against the shore, and it never ripples over the shallows, or frets in the rapids. It is as calm as a lake in its breadth, as graceful as an arrow in its rush, and as soft as the dew in its fall. Its swelling notes open as gracefully as the morning-glory in the sunlight, and the cadences close with the same gentleness, as the shades settle softly on the sentiment. 
                  The hall, to a hair's-breadth in form, and to a square inch in capacity, is adapted to music, and the audience of at least two thousand suffered nothing from the usual inconvenience of a crowd. The seats are comfortable, the walls handsome, the lights brilliant and the room well ventilated. 
                  These are our first impressions of a Philadelphia concert. We owe the performers one full feast of melody, and the managers our thanks for a complimentary ticket. If others know so much more of music that they enjoy it less, we recommend them to go again the first time, before they censure us for our extravagance. 
                  
                     1848.
                   
                
                
                  MUSICAL. 
                  WE attended the concert of instrumental music, given on Saturday evening, by Mr. G. Knoop and the Germania Society, under the direction of Mr. C. Lenschow. We cannot report the performance critically, but have none the less confidence in the justice of our judgment. The fulness and perfectness of a feeling authenticates itself, without either the process or the capacity for critical analysis. The violin of Schulze, the violoncello of Knoop, the compositions of Lenschow, the performance of the entire band prove and approve themselves, in the instant and complete satisfaction which they afford. Indeed, the conviction came to us by intuition, that music alone, of all the gifts bestowed upon humanity, is capable of giving expression to the highest aspirations of thought-the deepest emotions of feeling. Refinement, elocution, sublimity, power, are not the words for this service. Thought seems disembodied, emotion transfigured, and the inmost life opened to the highest influences. The statuary and painting of the age, it seems to us, register its attainments, but its music prophesies and promises the progress that lies before us. More-its use does not terminate in enjoyment; it is eminently educational-that for which there is no other avenue of reception and communication, gets translation through its infinite compass of meaning. 
                  Some such thoughts as these were awakened as we sat under the enchantment of that concert on Saturday night. We really care nothing about the method or argument of our notice. The band is entitled to the betrayal of our incompetency-it is the evidence, the effect, of their power. 
                  In one of the duets of Knoop and Schulze there were some strains that were more than vibrations of air, or mere wavelets of motion; they seemed very incarnations of beauty, and assumed a reality of existence and form, that makes us think of them now as of substantial things, which we would expect to meet again in the place where we left them. And Lenschow's overture! what a mystery of power in its conception, what a miracle of art in its reproduction! It seemed to us that the great globe revolved under his thought, rendering its life in all its immensity, in all its variety, to his apprehension-the discords reduced to harmony without a note lost; every whisper heard, every shout reported, every groan recorded; its sunshine and storm, its gladness and gloom-from the rustle of a leaf, to the earthquake shout of victorious battle, nothing missed-the whole multiform life of this wide earth expressed in correspondence of sound! 
                  Are we mistaken about the capacity of music, or its function tion and mission? How much there is in the imagination that can get no utterance, how much in emotion that words cannot impart! Surely, there must be some vehicle for these higher communications; and what is adequate but music? The range of expression within its agencies is varied and boundless as the powers of the soul, and must be designed for the utterance of the heart's whole compass and the fancy's entire play. 
                  But we sat down to invite our friends to those musical entertainments. We have but one earnest word to utter about them-go, ask no questions; take your heart along with you. If you have an acquaintance who is a fool, a puppy, a flirt, or any sort of snob, leave him, or her, or both, at home; take care not to be worried there with your own paltry wickednesses, or those of anybody else-go, sit down and surrender yourself for an hour or two to the Germania band and Herr Knoop, and give yourself one good chance to grow a little in the knowledge and relish of the pure and the beautiful. 
                
                
                  CHRISTMAS. 
                  CHRISTMAS has come, not back, but again-not the same but another. The Christmas of'48 suggests to some of us the Christmas of '18, all the more for resembling it the less. Every five years makes a change in us, or in the things around us, or in our mode of regarding them, or in both. The Christmas of '18 cannot be recalled. The mind can recollect events and things, and converse with their images, but the feelings and affections have no memory proper; their experiences cannot live again-the hortus siccus of the heart cannot be revived. Its passions and pains pass away as the weeds and flowers that bloom in their season, and then perish for ever-haply to sustain, by their decay, a nobler growth; perchance, to exhaust the genial bosom and the generous soil that produced them. It is well that the fragile verdure which adorns the bosom of spring gives place to the sturdier growth of summer, and the fruits of autumn. The harvest and the vintage retain the aroma of the infant year, and embody its promise in sobered fragrance and abiding use. Only the lingering maturity that is nipped by the frost, and the blighted vigor that rusts or rots on the stem, need mourn over the faded glory of its earliest hopes. 
                  We do not pause upon the closing circle of another year to weep over its waste, or to suffer again its follies and its faults. We have no power upon the past. Let it not paralyse the present or cumber the future. 
                  To the men and women who have preserved the freshness and goodness of childhood through all their growth, and added the strength of years to the brightness of youth, we offer our congratulations reverently. To the young we say, be glad and rejoice; gravity before wisdom is only the wilting of the affections. You are entitled to a spring-time, genial and joyous in its greenness, and you will work all the better at the tasks which await you for the wholesome hilarity of a happy heart. The aged who fancy that the world's work is done because they have quit working at it, and that all further or different doing is undoing, we advise to turn quietly and patiently aside into their eddy and let the current sweep on: the lumber that floats upon its waves cannot interrupt its course or alter its channel. But we render our homage to the goodness that has blessed the past and prophesies only good to the future, as it lies down to repose after a well-spent life. And to all we cordially tender the compliments of the season-especially to those who give us daily "a penny for our thoughts" and a kind wish to lighten the labor which we endure and enjoy in their service. 
                
                
                  PROMETHEUS. 
                  WHAT was his offence? The skeleton fact charges that he animated a man of clay with fire from heaven. What is the spirit of the fable? Does his punishment intimate that the Divine jealousy forbids such enlargement of the capacities and powers of our clod nature? Does it not rather mean the terrible responsibilities that attach to the act of conferring new functions and imparting larger liabilities. The proper human nature is higher and better and more capable of blessing than the brute nature; but the world's reformers have experienced the risk of arming their fellow men with new faculties and flinging them free into new fields of action. There is, in fact, and instinctive fear of freedom that clings closer to the slave than the chain that clanks upon his limbs. All this means something that ought to be understood, because it must be encountered. The world has always killed the prophets and stoned them that were sent unto it. Is it not this fear, guarding ignorance with the vigilance and ferocity of an instinct, that prompts to the infliction of martyrdom? So we understand the various forms of conservatism which, in their several ways, resist the progress of reform; and we do not ascribe it to deliberate hatred of good, nor do we despise or abhor the terror-stricken defender of his obsolete system. What else could make men earnestly regard him as an ENEMY who tells them the truth? 
                  On the other hand, the light is sent unto the darkness though it comprehendeth it not, and the favorites of heaven are ever sent out into the world like sheep among wolves.-The great Shepherd rising up early, as the nervous Hebraism has it, and sending them. They should understand their work, and when they shake their dooming fingers at the Temple and the State, let them be sure of their office, and as wise as they are earnest in its execution. Their rock, their chain, and their vulture will terribly avenge indiscretion. The natural penalties of ignorance and rashness are as sure as those of crime, and the consequences often as evil. Honest men are as often tempted to throw themselves presumptuously from the pinnacle of the temple, as others are to obey their appetites at the expense of their trust, or to demon-worship for the attainment of their ambition. But the courage, that wisdom directs and love prompts, will accomplish its mission, and secure its fruits, though not one stone of the religious or political establishments which resist be left upon another. Every free man will know how to emancipate his brother, and will have the heart to accomplish it. For the rest,-the dead must bury their dead. 
                
                
                  MILITARY. 
                  FROM the window of our sanctum, we have just had a fine view of the New York Light Guards, on parade, and of the crowd that accompanied them. The music, the march, the military emotion-what do they mean, interpreted into the harmonies of a higher style of life than ours now is? There is something grand in it, that, spite of ourselves, hides the horrible from our vision, and asks the recognition of our noblest sentiments. The mighty doing, the daring, the unselfish devotion of a generous chivalry! these are glorious things. Not the effects-the field of slaughter-the putrefaction that fattens the rank grass which waves over the forgotten dead-not the widowhood and orphanage which it crushes with its echoed agonies; but, the compression of all the energies of a whole life into one comprehensive aspiration, one mighty effort, which crowds an age into the action of an instant, and exerts to exhaustion all the powers of a human soul! Ah, there is something grand in that-dreadfully perverted, indeed, but not mean, selfish or even brutal. "Welcome to your gory bed" is an appeal to a sentiment of angelic origin, however fallen. The soldierly sentiment is felt rather than analyzed by those who indulge it, and is far from being understood by all who abhor it. 
                
                
                  THE TRUTH OF FICTION, AND ITS CHARM. 
                  No one loves to be deceived, to be cheated, to be made a fool of with a lie; yet fiction is almost universally agreeable. In fable, parable, allegory, and tale, it comes acceptably to every style of mind, and is employed for all manner of purposes. Making no pretensions to, and limited by none of the laws of, narrative truth and historic fact, it brings the truth of nature-the probable, the possible, the ideal-in their broadest range and utmost capabilities into the service of a favorite principle, and demonstrates its force and beauty and practicability in circumstantial details, which, like a panorama, presents an image so like an experience that we realize it for all the purposes of knowledge, hope and resolution. Mental and moral discipline are richly supplied by it, and the temporary elevation of thought and sentiment which it affords, is felt like a delicious enlargement of the actual life. 
                  The writer, having the control of his machinery, enlists the highest feelings in the plot of his story, and takes care to gratify them fully in the issue; making the mechanism of the imagination work out the best wishes of the heart. In its progress, while the favorite interest and the admired character are in peril, the reader, in brave and generous sympathy, adds his strength to the heroic effort and his enthusiasm to the noble impulse, and grows capable while he flatters himself that in like circumstances he would behave as magnanimously. It is the attraction of living a grand life, though only in the reveries of the fancy, that wins us away into the enchanted regions of fiction, from the hard-featured facts and urgent demands of our actual life; and the delight in the illusion proves that in right conditions and under favoring circumstances men would be as noble as poetry conceives, and their high destiny demands of them. Every aspiration for the highest right, every sympathetic emotion of virtue, however transient, unsteady, or misapplied, shows that we were created for honor, and glory, and immortality. 
                
                
                  NOVELS. 
                  OLD time mythologies and modern novels, the fictions of the heathen heaven and the fancy paradise of earth, all turn upon the love passion. Courtship and marriage are the staples of imaginative literature in every age, and this is the reason of it-"our loves are our life." The intersexual is the highest and noblest of them, and marriage is mutual completeness in each other of the parties to the union. Two do not become one; but two fragment natures in true marriage become one complete human existence. The unity is in the adjusted combination of related variety, producing entire, fully rounded and perfected being. 
                  The love of courtship is only the vestibule to marriage; and it is one of the greatest faults of fashionable fiction, that it drops the curtain upon the drama at the threshold of the conjugal relation, and leaves wedlock without representation or revelation. The marriage state is treated and trusted as if it were a sure-enough heaven to all that enter it, and its long substantial eternity is left to fashion itself out of the froth of an over-fond faith. The fortunes and the fates of sweethearts, their agonies and ecstacies, are made as exquisitely distressing as the wit of authorship can invent, which the reader is strengthened to sustain by the instinctive assurance that there is a delightful deliverance in reserve in the last chapter for the parties whose interests are the burden of the story; and, accordingly, justice is vindicated and happiness is distributed, to the heart's content, in the dnoment of the tale. But the great misfortune is that the post-nuptial history is not traced; the long limbo of an ill-assorted, passion-blinded marriage, with its hard-featured realities, is veiled by a sketch or two of the honey-moon ecstacies, and-the visionary reader is left well supplied with that sort of courage and enthusiasm which willingly burns down the house in the prospect of living most delightfully in the garden. It is but a bonfire and then a bower of bliss! Business, with its perplexities, babies and worm medicines, the price of marketing, and the fat in the fire generally, make no figure in these fancy pictures of the future. "Good bye, papa; the threatened distresses will only be deliciously romantic when divided with the man of my heart!" And so it is settled, for they love each other furiously ously on moonlight evenings, and that must ensure all the harmonies of taste and faith, and work and life; and they are launched and afloat in a pleasure-boat upon a shoreless sea! But, butterflies with broken wings are not fit subjects for amusement. The absurdity is sad enough to make it sacred. 
                  There is another form of the mischief, the very opposite of hysterical extravagance, which results also from drugging the sensitive soul with incessant stimulation-it is the callousness of exhausted sensibility-the emptiness of spent affections-the apathy which delirium tremens ends in-the stupor that follows the exhilaration of this drunkenness. 
                  The region of fiction is fine training ground for the understanding and affections. See that it does not become their bedlam and brothel. The culture and regulation of the imagination is of more moment to the life than any other department of our education. It is there that the man is developed or destroyed-out of the heart are the issues of life. Novel reading, and speculation in stocks, are only different methods of indulging in mental luxury. There are a thousand other varieties of sentimental licentiousness; some very profligate, some very prudent; and all alike dangerous in their respective ways. The different sorts of follies pass very severe judgments on each other. Wisdom sees them all very much alike. Keep your head clear, your heart clean, your hands busy-"be good and pure, and take trouble as little as possible." 
                
                
                  MILTON'S PARADISE LOST. 
                  THE subject of fictitious literature waits yet for a fair, free and truthful exposition. Who will take it up, and unfold it to the millions, who are as much interested and involved in it, too, as in any other question or fact of the times? We have some bold notions about it, and if we had the power to do the whole matter adequate justice, would give them expression. In our apprehension, as at present convinced, Milton's Paradise Lost is a very bad novel-a book whose mischief in theology, moral tone, and general influence, are not atoned for even by its poetry. Moreover, we think that Constant's Gospel Legend, "The Last Incarnation," succeeds perfectly just where Milton utterly breaks down-the theme of Paradise Regained. And that the acknowledged failure of the great English bard in his drama of the Redemption is no mean proof of his incapacity for that of the Fall of Man and the rebellion in the spiritual world. Do we transcend our liberty of free speech, or offend by the audacity of our thought? No matter. There are fictions which escape censure, and there are others which encounter it. They are alike unjust, unwise and ineffectual. If some free man had bravely told us in our boyhood that the Paradise Lost was only a brilliant falsehood, with all the worst evils of untruth involved in it, and that Gulliver's travels was true, all true, he would have rendered us the favor that we now intend for the boys and girls who may accept our suggestions, and put them to the test of earnest inquiry. But we did not intend even to open this topic, any more than we designed formally to review the paper before us. And we close abruptly (if not early enough), without even stating our opinions upon either. But, we know nothing of the author if he does not in sentiment most heartily repudiate the barbarous mythology, austere criminal justice, presumptuous personifications, courtly machinery, and diabolical violence of Milton's heaven. Byron's Vision of Judgment only exceeds it in irreverence, we think, because he dared to throw the burlesque into the mesh of its stage solemnities. It needs but to entertain this opinion upon suspicion, long enough to read the tables of contents, styled the arguments of the several books, to be prepared for agreement with our judgment of the whole work. We say this because we think no rational notion of heaven and hell, of the spiritual world and of its general economy, ever will become popular until the superstitions imbibed from the fiction of the great English bard are first put under the ban of public sentiment. Hitherto the poets of the world have, in fact, made its religions. It is time now for a higher inspiration than the past could supply, to supplant them. The Gospel system is demanded. The "fulness of time" has come, and that which is perfect must replace those which for their "weakness and unprofitableness" are to be abolished. 
                
                
                  MIRTH AND NOVELTY. 
                  THE love of novelty and the relish for news may degenerate into gossip and dissipation of mind, but these are only the more homely and commonplace forms of that spirit of inquiry which leads science to its tasks, and rewards and refreshes it with continually new discoveries. The desire for novelty has a more dignified, but not a more useful office in stimulating intellectual labor, than in those genial diversions which it prompts amid the drudgery of every-day business. 
                  And not only is the light entertainment of small talk about small matters good and wholesome for the mind, as exercise, without any other aim, is for the body; but a little mirth mixes well and profitably with both business and philosophy. How stupid life, both in labor and leisure, would be without that gayety within us which answers to the cheerfulness and beauty around us. Nay, its main currents run all the deeper, as well as fresher and purer, for the light rills that, laughing, dancing and sparkling, flow into them. The rivers would stagnate into pools if the rivulets ceased their play. Philosophers and men of business save their souls alive, and keep their intellects fresh and healthy, by mingling the mirthfulness of youth with the soberer labors of age; and even fun and philanthropy are often found in the closest connexion in the same character. 
                  The beneficent office of mirth is to shed sunshine upon the current experience of every hour, and to gild with its gaiety the long intervals which must happen between the grander pleasures of great events and achievements. If we are careful to keep it innocent and cordial, it will, in return, gladden and sweeten our lives with its genial joyousness and familiar beauty. 
                
                
                  REFORMS AND CHANGES 
                  OUGHT not to frighten us. Real reforms will not hurt any one who is worth caring for, and they have such an energy in them that they cannot be hindered if they even do some mischief to something or somebody; moreover, changes which would immediately and greatly alter the way the world goes on cannot happen and need not be feared. Those that are certainly coming, the world is pretty well prepared for before they can possibly take place. A wagon road over the Alleghany mountains was as sturdily and honestly resisted by the pack-horse men as any novelty can be. The country sustained the shock of that innovation, and will sustain some more. Let us not be frightened at new modes of doing old things, for that is all there is in what we call revolutions. 
                
                
                   
                  THEY STUCK TO IT. 
                  THE Quakers wouldn't swear-they affirmed that they would not. When people will do a thing, you can hinder them, if you are strong enough; but, if they won't, they won't, no matter how strong you are. The Quakers stood their ground, and Old England knocked under. In 1696 their simple affirmation was accepted in legal proceedings as an oath. Hurrah for the sort of resistance called non-resistance. It can't be beaten into compliance, for it needs no energy for success except that of endurance, and when that gives way it conquers; for dying is a triumph to the passive principle-it is the strongest sort of negation. While the hero who must do something great, fails when he gets his head broke. 
                
                
                  DEATH. 
                  DEATH has as many shapes as life. We have seen children breathe away their gentle spirits as sweetly as a rose exhales its perfume. We had an aunt who loved us with a mother's tenderness; when we reached her bedside, her children had drawn back into a circle, and stood gazing in sacred awe upon the features that had just settled into the sanctity of death; a cry of bereaved affection recalled her from the confines of the spirit world; the emotions of resuscitated life softly returned into her face, the chest heaved again, and on the last long breath as it parted around our boyish brow, the ascending spirit whispered benedictions on our head. The wife of our medical preceptor, a moment before she expired, asked if the lights had been put out. "No, Jane," said the Doctor, "your sight is failing." "Then I'm dying," said she, in a tone of slight surprise; and quickly added, "why, how pleasant it is to die." 
                  We have seen some go off in the ecstacies of delirium; others in full possession of their intellect, in a storm of unavailing resistance to the grim destroyer. Once we witnessed the last moments of a distinguished statesman; he crouched and begged in so base a spirit for another day, another hour, of worthless, aimless breathing, that we turned away from the dishonored carcase with disgust and loathing of so mean a spirit. Napoleon died in a dream of battle; and Lord Byron, weary, satiated and desolate, said, "Let me rest now." The last words of John Quincy Adams more happily illustrated his nobler life. He was not weary, exhausted or surprised; he had lived and rounded off his life, fulfilled his task, the last hour's work was finished-to him it was not the end of life, but "the end of earth;" let it pass away, "I am composed." It was strikingly significant. 
                
                
                  MR. ADAMS. 
                  THE remains of Mr. Adams were brought to this city on Tuesday last, in a special train of cars under escort of the Committee of the House, consisting of one member from each State in the Union, and were received at the railroad depot by the mass of our citizens. A ceremonial had been previously arranged by the city authorities for the reception, expressive of the regard which his life has won in the hearts of his countrymen and the world. But the feeling of the community was too deep and too general, and the concourse of people which it brought together too great, to give place for the formalities of a procession. The City Corporation the Bench, the Bar, and the Benevolent Societies, got into the designed order upon the pavement, but the multitude that crowded the streets, through which the cortege passed, was too vast for formal organization. Silently and reverently as the hearse passed slowly on, the people stood and rendered the homage due to a long life of virtuous principles and illustrious deeds. That night the body rested in the Hall of Independence, and the next morning was conducted to the railroad for New York. 
                  The sentiment of the community, expressed by all our public bodies, and in the spontaneous action of the populace, was, we doubt not, the just response to the claims of the patriot and the man whose life they honored and whose death they mourned. The forms of respect adopted were as nearly appropriate to the character of the man as inveterate custom would permit, and the correspondence, though not perfect, was carried so far as to prove that the points of distinguishing excellence in the man were correctly appreciated. Mr. Adams' life is not lost upon his countrymen-the lesson which it taught so plainly is not wholly misunderstood. 
                  Humanity is a marvellous-a monstrous mixture of good and evil, but it never fails to recognize, at last, the good that has been incarnated in its midst. The impostures of high position and the heroism of blood, addressed to the coarser relishes of the animal sentiments, receive their homage, but there is a higher and purer nature alive among these instincts, capable of beneficent revelations from the spiritual world. Every true man has a mission to these nobler feelings, and no word or deed directed to them fails of its design. In the pit of the cheapest theatre a noble sentiment and a generous deed, broadly presented to their apprehension, breaks like a sun-burst through the mist, and kindles their hearts into generous sympathy. They may mingle idolatries with the higher worship, but truth and goodness are not without a witness in the great deep heart of the community. 
                  We may have processions now, as empty of meaning as "they are magnificent in display; or they may be barbarous offerings to a bloody idol, or as silly as their purposes are selfish; but Philadelphia has had one holy day, whose sentiment will not be dislodged, and whose influence will linger in the bosom of the people, till in their season the good fruits will be brought forth. The men who felt, however dimly, the mysterious presence of the disembodied spirit, as the body passed solemnly before them, and opened for a moment their inner life to the light of its purer sphere, were changed in the image of their minds, and acquired a new habitude of heart, and their after life will bear proportioned correspondence to his with whom they were communing. Thank God for the memories of the greatly good, for the lessons of their lives, and the sealing solemnity of their deaths. 
                  
                     March 11, 1848.
                   
                
                
                  THE OBSEQUIES OF GENERAL TAYLOR, 
                  at Philadelphia, cost fewer lives than we calculated. The ceremony and parade were grandly got up and very honorably attended. Such a day as it was, too! It was exhausting to stand but an hour and look at the procession as it passed. It was a severe service to render, but it is well that there is such loyalty to men and such reverence for high qualities; and if the propriety and use of such honors to the dead are questioned, let us observe that it is important to the living to keep alive the love and honor due to greatness. We had the same thought when the crowd followed Henry Clay from the boat to his lodgings, on his retreat from Washington, t'other day. We leave the deservings of the men out of the question," when we speak of the necessity there is for giving expression to the regard entertained for greatness, supposed or real. The sentiment is servile only in the slavish, whom it cannot hurt, but helps to govern; and "it shows nobly in the highest." There is, in fact, as much honest hero-worship in the world as there is ambition to receive it. Adjust these things rightly, and they will serve the world's best interests well. 
                
                
                  THE MATERIAL WORLD VANQUISHED, AND THE SPIRITUAL ATTACKED. 
                  THE first half of this nineteenth century has been very busy discovering, improving and employing the mechanical forces of nature; the physical world has been the theatre of a mighty effort, and it has been so successful, that miracles have become the most familiar matters of fact. All the sober aims of past ages have been fully achieved, all the prophesies realized, and nothing but the fairy tales of the middle ages left unfulfilled by the facts of our experience; and even some of these wildest freaks of imagination have, in a wonderful degree, been converted into positive realities, by the science of our day. 
                  The telegraphic current can put a girdle round the earth as quick as Shakspeare authorized the fairy Puck to promise the achievement; the stories of Eastern magic do not much outstrip the wonders of modern chemistry; and it is probable enough that the balloon will soon become a reliable means of transportation. Just as soon as the power of the wheel and axle is well applied in its direction and propulsion, aerial voyages will become at once the easiest, safest, and quickest methods of extensive travel. It is a curious thing, by the by, that after all the talk we make about imitating nature in our means and processes, that invention: of the human reason, the wheel and axle which has no type nor hint in all the realm of nature, beats all her methods of motion and all her instruments of power. No application of the principle of the wing, or fin, or leg, for the purposes of locomotion, will at all compare with it. It is true, also, that the screw and the compound pulley, which are without example in nature, are next in value to that which works such wonders as we see in the rivers and the ocean, and on, the railroads by which we link the seas and streams together for our purposes. 
                  But the period so fertile in physical discovery, and so full of mechanical triumphs, has not been wholly given up to the interests of materialism. The most astonishing facts seem rather to serve as ladders to the heights of the most astonishing faiths. Commerce and intercourse by means of steam with all parts of our world, has its counterpart in a correspondence pretty regular, and growing every day more general, with all other worlds! The submarine telegraph between Dover and Calais, is matched by the sub-sepulchral between New York and "Kingdom Come." The manner of communication is a little cumbersome, as yet, hut the methods will improve, and better machinery and agents will soon bring it into easy and useful practice. A proper electrical apparatus, that can write out its own movements in intelligible characters, would be a grand improvement upon the clumsy process of rapping the alphabet, and waiting for leading questions. 
                   
                  And now that we are in the world of mysteries, we may add, that metaphysics has had a revival of late years, and that antiquarians and naturalists have also been at work unravelling the records of remote antiquity, in the symbols, artificial and natural, which are supposed to retain them for the age that is wise enough to read and render them. The Geologists and Egyptologists have rather worsted the old chronology; and now, some of the leading naturalists are busy disproving the unity of the human races. And so we go. Verily, it seems that twenty or thirty years of peace breeds more mischief and turns up more real revolutions, than a century of war. 
                
                
                  VERSATILITY OF TALENT. 
                  WE have given this brief abstract of Mr. Walker's letter, in the main, to indicate our respect for the cleverness which it exhibits-the manly efficiency of the lawyer and statesman, enacting the physician in a great emergency, as if to the manner bred, and, for the abstract inference that a man that is really good for anything answers tolerably well-aye, often very well, for everything. A man well made up and well finished, is very nearly a whole hand wherever he happens to be placed. The notion that a man can be competent to only one kind of work seems to us very like a watch with only one true wheel in it. If it were the fact, which is doubtful, the whole machine is, after all, a very poor one. Universal pretenders are very poor humbugs, but sneers at universal geniuses betray anything but sound judgment and enlarged observation. The instances of excellence in very numerous and varied abilities are as plenty as blackberries. Indeed, your partially developed people have very seldom eminence in the one thing for which all their other faculties are smothered, and there are the best reasons in the world for it. We know an artist now, who, besides being preeminent in the quality of his work, can do twice as much of it in a given time as the average of the best workmen. He ascribes his facility to the fact that he has learned and; worked at five different trades. 
                  Dr. Adam Clark, the linguist, theologian, antiquarian, and master of a dozen of the physical sciences, says the adage "too many irons in the fire" has done a world of mischief, and adds, "put shovel, tongs and poker, all into the fire, and see that none of them burn." Walter Scott was poet, antiquarian, sportsman, sheriff, architect, novelist, and a dozen other things at once. Alexander Campbell, of Bethany, Virginia, is a profound linguist, a revival preacher, schoolmaster, farmer, post-master, politician, architect, anatomist, and several other things beside, and cannot be much beat in any of them by anybody. The thing is worth thinking of. We like Robert J. Walker for that cholera" business, and have the more hope of him in everything else that the country expects from him. 
                
                
                  EDUCATION 
                  is exercise of the particular power of faculty which is the subject of it. It is not instruction or dictation-it is not what is put into, but what is taken out of, the faculty. Food, however necessary to labor, is yet not labor, nor the energy of it. It must first be digested and assimilated-it must be made part and parcel of the body-it must be incorporated, and made identical with the active powers by their own interior action, before it is in any wise helpful in their proper work. Gourmands and crammed scholars, alike, may be as stupid as they are fat and full. 
                   
                  Education is training, after the example of the turf, where every nerve is toned, and every muscle strained habitually, in the actual struggles of the conflict. And the education of one faculty is not necessarily the education of another, any more than listening to music will sharpen the eyesight. For the most positive reasons, therefore, acuteness of the understanding does not ensure soundness of morals. They depend upon different faculties, and the one may be neglected in the cultivation of the other. Most men, in fact, know better than they do. And this is because they are more attentive to preaching than to practice. Fine speeches are not exactly good deeds, nor always productive of them. The laws of mind arise out of its nature, which is varied in powers, parts, or faculties, capable of separation and independent activity, and generally in our systems of training too much divorced from each other. Educate the whole man, body and soul, mind and morals, in theory and practice, and all together, if you would have a complete, whole, or holy being. 
                
                
                  BUFF. 
                  WHEN I was a very little boy I had a very big dog. He took his name from his color-it was Buff-not from his character, for he was as remarkable for magdoganimity as for strength and courage. He was very patient, too; all the worry and work that a seven-year old urchin could inflict upon him in a long holiday never disturbed his equicanianimity. He probably had once been a puppy, but no one who knew him would think of uncoiling such an inference from the principles of natural history to his prejudice-he was every inch and every ounce a dog, and one of the biggest and noblest of the race, at that. How he hated the harness of my little wagon in summer, and board-sled in winter! He was faithful, and fond of his little master; but naturally enough, while he performed the duties and felt the sentiments of a dog, he resisted the degradation of a hack. Nothing else ever made him exhibit any doggedness of temper. I never caught him in a sneak except when he was trying to escape the collar and traces; nor at a dodge, except when a hole in a fence, or the low door of his dormitory, offered him the opportunity of stripping me off his back. My troubles and tumbles of this sort often ruffled my temper with him; but more mature reflection has long since reconciled me to his conduct in this respect, and in the "late remorse of love," I admit that he was right. Alas, poor Buff! Every dog, they say, has his day; but Buff's was shamefully shortened. A beggar poisoned him; for it was a principle with him never to let a tatterdemalion cross our door-step. He had an opinion and a post to maintain-he had some dignity of his own, and, of course, a decent indignation against vagabonds deficient in both dress and address. He suspected them of fleas, perhaps; perhaps of felony; any how, he could not abide them; and if it was only a capricious antipathy, I don't think it a very serious impeachment of his otherwise unquestionable philanthropy. He may have been a reformer, and had a mission; and for that reason, must be excused if he garrisoned the premises with rather severe fidelity. I doubt not that excellent authorities can be found for growling and barking alarmingly for conscience's sake, and I claim the benefit for the justification of Buff; the more by token that the poor fellow fell a martyr to it at last. See, there is a doctrine and a parable even in the life and death of a dog. 
                  One day-how well I remember the day-I was trying to drive a family of refractory pigs out of the yard, and, after a dozen failures, called upon Buff for assistance. He had been looking on contemplatively for half an hour, while the struggle lasted, without offering any assistance or exhibiting any interest in the matter, and now absolutely refused to interfere. There was another witness of my perplexity-my father was standing on the porch, very quietly waiting for the result. A regular fight had begun with Buff for his insolent indifference and downright disobedience; but, detecting the presence, and hoping for the interposition of the paramount authority, I began my complaint with, "Papa, what is the reason that Buff won't hunt these pigs?" 
                  "Why, William, don't you know that a big dog will not worry little pigs? If you want to have help at a mean little job, you must employ a puppy in the service." 
                  Buff was fairly vindicated, and I had a lesson which has served me many a time since. Just then I felt only the rebuke, without at all relishing it, and, indeed, without fully understanding its philosophy. 
                  That night, after saying my daily prayer, and feeling as good as if I had been whipped, or praised, or pardoned some little iniquity, and had my account with the world and the world to come happily squared, and at liberty to begin again, renewed the complaint and apology by saying, "But, papa, what is the reason that Buff oughtn't to worry little pigs when they are in the yard, where they have no business to be?" 
                  "Why, see here, my son; little pigs have some rights, even when they are doing wrong. Haven't they?" 
                  "No; I don't see how they can be right when they are wrong." 
                  Smiling in a way that made me think I was not quite up to the argument, although I could not see the kink in it, he answered: 
                   
                  "Well, then, if pigs are not quite right when they are wrong; or, what is a very different thing, if they have no rights when they are in anything wrong-as, for instance, in the wrong yard or wrong trough-little boys and little dogs may, nevertheless, be wrong in their way of turning them out-may they not?" 
                  "I suppose so; but"- 
                  "Come, come, William; you can defend yourself any other time. Buff knows we are talking about him, and he is pressing in between us here, and looking at you, as much as to say, Little master, I can't speak for myself you know. Do listen to what papa is going to say for me." 
                  "Get away, Buff," was my answer; "you have your great big paw on my toe that has a splinter in it." 
                  "He has a worse grip of you than that, William: he has you in the wrong. Put up your little foot, and let me see that dreadful sore toe. Tut, there is no splinter there." 
                  "But there was one, yesterday. See how red it is." 
                  "Red, William; it isn't as red as your face; and I know it doesn't hurt you as badly as you feel somewhere else." 
                  "I want to go to bed, papa." 
                  "No, no, my boy; you are too wide awake just now for that. You have not been so wide awake, all over and all through, for a week; and I want you to reflect, while you lie awake to think over this matter, that there are some things and some ways of doing things, that are unworthy of anything but puppies and mean people: no matter what wrongs they undertake to correct. You wouldn't smother a poor little pig in a puddle because it happened to be trespassing on your play-ground. You wouldn't kick a little baby with your boots on, for taking your piece of bread and butter that happened to fall within its reach, any more than Buff would crush the bones of a little pig for playing in the yard. It is not what a wrong-doer may seem to deserve when you are angry, but what is becoming to yourself, that you should do. Now, my son, shake hands with Buff-poor Buff-and then with me, and go to your little bed. There, that's right; now run along." 
                  "But, papa"- 
                  "Never mind, now; go, and don't walk as if you were carrying a weight, nor look as if it were too heavy for you. Open your window, for the robins will be singing in the apple-tree in the morning; your dear little toe will be well as ever, and you will be as happy and merry as a bird again. You will be my own brave boy; and when you get to be a big one, you'll understand Buff." 
                  The moral of my story, as applied to the hunters of men, is-altered a little from the original-"In all your service, copy Buff." 
                
                
                  FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848. 
                  THE steam-ship Cambria, which left Liverpool on the 27th Feb., and arrived at New York on Saturday morning last, brought all the details yet received of the revolution which commenced in Paris on the 22nd. The latest telegraphic despatch from Paris is dated 7 o'clock, A.M., Feb. 26th. The events of three days only are embraced in the reports received; but these suffice to establish the fact of the complete overthrow of the throne, the flight of Louis Philippe, the institution of a provisional government, and the probable erection of a republic. 
                  We have neither room for the particulars of this glorious achievement, nor language to express the emotions which it has awakened. The most malignant despotism in Europe is demolished, and the greatest of her oppressed nations is free! Ever since that bastard birth of the three glorious days of 1830 has been upon the throne, he has been laboring to blast its aims and disappoint its purposes; he has shackled the the press, abridged popular representation, and resisted the generous spirit of social reform. Abusing the trust reposed in him, he steadily advanced from one stage of encroachment upon the rights of the people to another, until virtually he took the attitude of open war against the French nation. He fortified Paris, garrisoned it with 100,000 troops and sentinelled the kingdom with 300,000 more. Thus secured and provided, he addressed himself to the work of extinguishing the last spark of popular liberty. His police courts punished the slightest indications of the reform spirit, whether they occurred in political papers, industrial tracts, theological essays or album poetry, until the censorship of the press became as petty in its details, as it was sweeping in extent and monstrous in spirit. To guard himself against the danger of free speech he forbade the assemblies of the people, their processions and banquets, by which they sought to promote the peaceable redress of grievances and the progress of political and social reform. This last aggression brought on the crisis. He attempted to prevent a grand Convention of the reformers, appointed for the 22d of Feb. The people, nevertheless, gathered in multitudes in the streets-they were dispersed by the regular troops-they assembled again and again, and as often met the military in all the confidence of right and all the courage of a generous enthusiasm. The masses offered themselves not so much for battle as in sacrifice to the soldiery, and in a spirit that rendered their slaughter impossible even to mercenaries. The National Guard sympathized with the people, and from them the army caught the contagion and declared for reform. 
                   
                  On the 24th the King abdicated in favor of the Count de Paris. It was too late. Friday, a republic was proclaimed, and, in the name of the sovereign people, a provisional government was published, among whom we recognize Arago, the astronomer, Lamartine, and Louis Blanc, a distinguished writer of the Fourierite school. The same day an order was issued, in the name of the French people, in which the meeting of the Ex-Chamber of Peers was interdicted, signed by the members of the provisional government. 
                  In the progress of these affairs the Tuilleries was captured by the people, the furniture destroyed, and the throne burnt in the street. The army had abandoned the defence of the palace, and the royal family fled from the city. 
                  Five hundred of the citizens, no more, were killed in the several affrays, and the last accounts reported the fighting at an end and the peace and order of the city restored. 
                  Come what may of all this, the event fills us with the deepest religious joy. Physical force of the most imposing magnitude has once more been met by moral power and disarmed as by enchantment. Despotism has been taught that standing armies are no security for thrones; that might melts away in the august presence of right. Cobbling conservatism has an opportunity to compare itself with regenerating radicalism; the quickest and best way of redressing hoary-headed grievances is demonstrated, and the Solomons of Political Science have learned that whether the people are fit to govern themselves or not they intend to do it. 
                  The French people in their first Revolution had to fight their way up through such depths of debasement and darkness that they grew savage in the desperate strife. Like King David, their hands were so full of blood when their enemies were all conquered, that they were unfit to build the temple. They had, like him, however, collected the most magnificent materials, and in 1830 it went up almost without the sound of a hammer. But a new dispensation has been given; the sacrifices of the old became intolerable, and its ritual a mockery, and now in three days it is overturned; not one stone is left upon another, and its ministrations are distributed over the whole discipleship of republican liberty. 
                  We don't want to frighten good people into philosophical fits with our fanaticism. We hold the same creed for the world which they do for themselves, and only ask that its doctrines shall receive universal application. Nor do we mean to construe it so rigidly, even in favor of life and liberty, as to affirm that all men are born equal in all things, but only that all men ought to be held equal before the laws in those respects in which they are equal before God. We believe, indeed, that "different measures of the same spirit are given unto every man to profit withal," but we cannot therefore agree that any one shall monopolize his neighbor's share because it happens to be a small one. In a word, our notion is that the Creator made every man purposely, and that he will answer that purpose if he is as well managed as he is made. 
                  The old doctrine of the social compact, which holds that men must surrender an indefinite number of their rights, upon entering into society, in order to secure the balance, is a most villainous philosophy, invented by Prerogative, to justify its frauds upon human rights to any extent which might suit its own convenience. It bases itself upon the falsehood that, isolation is the state of nature, and society a matter of convention. The truth is, that man is social by his constitution, as much as sheep and crows are gregarious by theirs; and every faculty and power given to him is capable of harmonious and beneficent action in the social and political organizations adapted to human nature. It would reproach the wisdom and power of the most ordinary mechanic, if he put one wheel more or less into a machine than its movements required; and it would be no less discreditable to him, if he made any of them so weak or so strong as to endanger the rest by its legitimate play. If the existing order is incompatible with the liberty of all, it is the fault of the institution; mend that; don't mar the man. 
                  Moreover, it is less expensive of life and happiness for men to govern themselves any way they please, than to be governed by a few in the way which they don't like. Moreover again, men cannot in fact be governed by anybody any better than they are capable of, and that much they can do for themselves. 
                  People talk of anarchy and despotism as if convulsions were more dangerous than consumption. It is nonsense; authority sheds more blood, breaks more hearts, and crushes more greatness in any month, than popular revolutions and popular governments do in a century. Five hundred people were killed in Paris the other day-what then? The inviolability of life is not in its continuance but in its freedom. Killing people dead is not the crime of crimes; killing them alive-the death that never dies-is the essential hell which human tyranny inflicts. The loss of life! why, the majority of those men lost nothing of their life by a violent death, they lived it out to its full measure in one comprehensive aspiration, one mighty effort which exerted to exhaustion all the powers within them. A charge of gunpowder does more burning in one flash, and with tenfold more effect, than the saltpetre and charcoal would accomplish, if they were kept smouldering for a month. We are far from believing that "a revolution is not worth one drop of blood." We would agree with O'Connell if he had said that a revolution is not worth one crime, because it is made worthless by the crime. Liberty is cheap enough to the gainers at the price of life; not of the lives they take but of those they give. 
                  If the French people fall again into confusion, if they rush into anarchy and civil bloodshed, or what is even worse, if they compromise principles and patch up a false peace, based upon incoherent systems, we will neither wonder nor despair. We do not despise our fellow men, and we do not fear them; we are just as certain that they are competent to their own regeneration as we are that God made them for goodness and happiness; and, just as surely as we are immortal, our eyes shall yet behold the consummation, and we wait and look in a hope that rises out of the nature of man, and rests upon the promises of Heaven. 
                
                
                  "VISIONARY!" 
                  SIXTY years ago Herman Husband, of Somerset, Pennsylvania, predicted that the road, then only a pack-horse path over the mountains, would yet be paved all the way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Within the lifetime of the children who heard him, the promised paved road has been made and become obsolete! the canal dug beside it has fallen behind the demand, and steam velocity already replaces them all! The visionaries of the present day are, very likely, as much short of future history in their hopes as Herman Husband was in his day. But prophets will at last work themselves into credit; the world will learn faith, and its works will grow continually more and more worthy of its origin and its destiny. Fulfilment follows so close upon the heels of prediction already, that conservatism is getting afraid to throw stones at the prophets, lest they may hit the facts in the face. 
                
                
                   
                  LIFE. 
                   
                     Monstrous and false in form, 
                     But true and beautiful in promise; 
                     Wisdom and love, with savage force allied! 
                     The plan, the purpose, and the means- 
                     The thought and will of God achieved 
                     Through discipline of pain! 
                     Vigilant, relentless, yet beneficent the law; 
                     The wounds flow wine, the flesh is bread. 
                     Caucasus in calvary resolved; 
                     The vulture slain, and the cross crowned. 
                     
                        Pain is not punishment, and there is no Death.
                      
                     The world's hope but waits the great atonement, 
                     Each serving to his brother's use and suffering for his sin, And the DIVINE for all. 
                     And the sacrifice shall not cease, nor justice reign 
                     Until 
                     Faith stands rendered into knowledge, 
                     And worship incorporates with work- 
                     Till the world's life obeys its science, 
                     And man is organized in unity 
                     With MAN, with NATURE, and with GOD. 
                   
                   
                     The universe is one-reconciliation is redemption-harmony is heaven. 
                     "The mystery hidden from the ages," 
                     Rendered by this key- 
                     The Sphinx shall perish, the curse cease, and death and hell be swallowed up in VICTORY.
                      
                   
                   
                  
                      
                        EXPLANATION OF THE SKETCH. 
                        Mr. Sartain's "Lot," in the Monument Cemetery of Philadelphia is a right-angled parallelogram, thirty-three feet by twelve. Close-planted cedar trees give to its two longer sides walls of evergreen. At the entrance of the avenue thus formed stand two Obelisks (monolyth) bearing a brief record of the interments. At the end of the avenue, and closing it, is the structure which supports the group represented by the engraving: it is in the form of the propylum, gateway, or entrance to the court or vestibule of the ancient Egyptian temple. The structure, including the statuary, is sixteen feet high, the base seven. The Sphinx is four feet in length; the Psyche, four in height; or "small life size." They are metallic the monument is of stone. On its plain centre slab or tablet is the inscription given on the opposite page. 
                     
                   
                   
                  IN the apprehension that the Sphinx symbolizes the Design, the End, and the Discipline of life, the Minerva head, Venus bosom, and brute body represent, respectively, the Wisdom, Love, and Corrective Force which rule in the economy of man's earthly existence. 
                  The fabulous monster serves as well to signify the mixed intelligence, affections, and animal instincts of the human constitution. The Greeks gave it the head and breasts of a woman, a human voice, the body of a dog, the tail of a serpent, the wings of a bird, and the paws of a lion,-human, reptile, quadruped and bird. The Egyptians made it something less complex in form, but evidently intended an equal comprehensiveness of allusion. 
                  Employed here only for the higher significance of the Myth, its expressive intimation of the creative mind, benevolent aim, and providential policy, apparent in the history of human existence, are mainly intended; and the accomodations and additions in the symbolism of the group and decorations are made to conform to this purpose. 
                  The sacred Tau of the Egyptians, suspended upon the bosom of the Sphinx by a necklace, formed of a serpent with its tail in its mouth, indicates the eternal creative energy. The figure of Psyche, or type of the soul, rests lightly upon the body of the Sphinx; her right arm around its neck; in her left hand a butterfly-immortality solving the enigma of sublunary life. 
                  The group of statuary rests upon the capping-stone of the monument; below it, upon the cornice of the entablature, is a figure in alto relievo mourning over the ashes in a funeral urn, unmindful of the ascending spirit, symbolized by the winged flame, which forms in the composition the balance and contrast on the one side to the urn on the other. In the cove cornice, immediately below the figure of Grief, the general form of Egyptian decoration is observed, with the difference of substituting for their winged globe an hour-glass encircled with an endless serpent. 
                  The design of the Monument, the model of the statuary, and the drawing engraved, are by Mr. Sartain. 
                  The INSCRIPTION was intended to be enigmatical. The underlying idea is that all religious faiths have a central correspondence, traceable through their diverse traditions and formulas; and, that all are so far true as they are universal; thus, the Wisdom and Love of God are known of all men; the goodness and severity of his providence are their hope and fear. Prometheus, the man-maker of the Greek mythology, so far corresponds to the Christ of the Christian system, that he is chained upon his rock from the beginning of the offence, as the Lamb is "slain (or nailed to his cross) from the foundation of the world"-the woes of earth echoed in the passion of the Creator till the sacrifice shall cease. 
                  Both the Greek and Christian system say of their vicegerent Divinity "he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet, we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted." The parallelism of the Representative Man of the heathen creed and the "Second Adam" of Christianity is obvious in the most essential points: The cross of Calvary and the rock of Caucasus abide the curse till the atonement is complete and the redemption achieved. 
                  The Myth of the Sphinx is well rendered, in one of its striking aspects, by the idea that Life propounds its riddle to every traveller, destroying those who fail to solve it, and that the monster is fated to perish when its mystery is made known. When the disciples came to Jesus and asked him "Why speakest thou unto the multitude in parables?" he answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given." 
                  It is just as true of the insurgent physical forces of nature, and of the disturbed social relations of men, that they must be subdued and harmonized by the discoveries of natural science. 
                  This consummation is the world's hope. The oracle of Apollo declared that when the Sphinx's riddle should be resolved, there would be an end of the evil which she wrought on the earth. Isaiah the Evangelical prophet, Peter the apostle of the Messiah, and John the revelator of "the things which shall be hereafter," speaking for the past, the present and future of the Church, say, "We look for new heavens, and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness;" and Paul, the grand expositor of the faith as it is received among us, declares that a time cometh when all rule, and all authority, and all power (all executive government) shall be put under his feet-the feet of the Son of Man. Moreover "the Son (the representative man; certainly not the Divinity) shall also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all." In other words, conformity to the divine order shall be spontaneous. Then the Wisdom and Love will be severed from their Sphinx-like union with disciplinary force; Law will govern without penal sanctions; and Liberty will reign in universal harmony-the Sphinx shall perish, the atonement cease, and "all that have followed Him in the regeneration," "filling up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ," "being partakers of his sufferings, may be glad, also, with exceeding joy when his glory shall be revealed." 
                  So the atonement is laid upon all; the patriot, sage and saint, in their several degrees, giving their lives for their brethren, take up their cross and follow Him, that "having suffered with him, they may also reign with him." 
                  In a lower application of the oracle, it is noteworthy that Hercules, the type of all-conquering labor, slew the vulture of Prometheus; suggesting that the evil of the natural world must be overcome by heroic industry-that Labor, the Immanuel, the perpetual creator, the God-with-us, must subdue the enmity of matter and release humanity from its physical bondage and suffering. 
                
                
                  DEATH OF O'CONNELL. 
                  DANIEL O'CONNELL died at Genoa, in Italy, on the 15th of May, 1847, in his seventy-second year. He was on a pilgrimage, less, perhaps, with the hope of recovering his health, than with the purpose of religious preparation for death, after the manner of his church. His heart was embalmed and deposited at Rome. It does not appear by the letter of his chaplain that this was done by his own express direction, but his mind is so interpreted by those who claim to know it best; his body is to be sent back to Ireland. 
                  O'Connell's devotion to his church and his country were alike intense, and alike effectual for both. Forty years of such service as he gave to them could not fail to tell for the interest of its objects. The civil and religious liberty of the party which he represented and led were ever blended in his apprehensions of duty, and he advocated them with perfect sincerity, we doubt not. The political oppression of his set was well fitted to arouse the enthusiasm of his youth, and a lifetime of mutual toil and triumph must at last have identified his very existence with theirs. O'Connell was as much and as earnestly a Catholic as he was a patriot, and he could scarcely be otherwise. 
                  Here, where religion is left by government to take care of itself in absolute freedom, vehement devotion to the interests of a particular creed is as illiberal as it is unnecessary; but in Ireland, under the dominion of the double-headed monster, Church and State, the defence of an oppressed religious party against the established hierarchy, is the mode of practically advocating the general right of all men to freedom of opinion. 
                  If O'Connell sought to establish the Roman Catholic supremacy he was a bigot; but, he asked only for freedom and equality, and no man has a right to infer that he wanted more. In fact, the dissenters in Ireland shared largely and freely in the triumphs which he won for the principle of toleration, and the Quakers, Baptists, and Independents of Great Britain regard him with esteem, for the benefits he conferred upon them, which all their difference of doctrinal opinion cannot materially affect. 
                  O'Connell has been the hope of Ireland for a quarter of a century, and we think she is not disappointed in him. He has lived through, and accomplished for her, the greatest and most promising change that has passed upon her character and fortunes for centuries. He was himself the first Roman Catholic who held the office of Lord Mayor of Dublin for more than two hundred years, and the first of that religious persuasion admitted to a seat in the British House of Commons for as long a period. From his organization, the Catholic Irish have the conviction of their strength, and his policy has taught them the best way to use it. If they are not great enough to receive and steady themselves upon the principle that "no revolution is worth one drop of blood," at least they must know, with an assurance that will save them, that rivers of it cannot purchase the benefits of revolution to them. O'Connell uttered this oracle to the Irish people, and it is their inheritance henceforth. Every instance of disobedience will be followed by disasters which will repreach its truth, until it shall become at last equally certain and sacred to that great people, and then a wise obedience will achieve for them all the good that political liberty can confer upon a nation. 
                  When Christendom receives and obeys the Evangel of peace, it will be christianized. It is the truth of religion applied in the conduct of politics. If blood shed in justifiable rebellion has heretofore purchased good for this or any other people, it is not yet proved that resistance without physical force would not have achieved the same results, and that, too, without entailing the curses and crimes of war (a brood of vulgar heroes and a taste for human blood) as an incumbrance upon the legacy forever. 
                  The ancient legal trial by "battel" long since fell into disuse upon the clear conviction that taking the sacrament and invoking the God of battles had no effect upon the issue of the strife, and never did anything for the right. Nations, however, are duellists still, because, perhaps, there is no common tribunal for the settlement of their difficulties and the enforcement of civil justice between them, and so, Poland was dismembered, and so Mexico may be; so Russian ruffians became heroes, and so Yankee bullies will be converted into patriots and public benefactors in lots to suit the public offices. But truth is to be ascertained by evidence, and right settled by reason, for gunpowder is not argument, the Prince of Peace is not the God of War, and the Christian priest who teaches otherwise has mistaken the altar; he should minister at Moloch's. 
                  Daniel O'Connell lived in the Roman church and died in bondage to its forms; but Irish catholic, political agitator, and popular leader as he was, he had the heart and head to understand the spirit of Christianity, and the courage to apply it in the conduct of a political rebellion. The man that could make the Irish millions stand still in an attitude of sublime non-resistance for years of terrible suffering, and under terrible provocation, waiting for justice always before withheld, and still insultingly denied-patient and peaceful in the conscious strength of vast numbers and perfect organization, with all their natural enthusiasm intensified by the highest excitement systematically sustained-that man had no superior of his kind in his own or in any other age. 
                  But he sent his heart to Rome! if he did this, and if he did it in the coarse spirit of popish superstition, it is sad to know it. It may be otherwise; but if it is even so, it is well that his religion was at least true, if not wise. Better to us seems such gross misapprehension of his Maker and of himself, than a paltry, false compliance with the forms of a truer creed, for any side purpose, high or low, broad or selfish. If our great men had their hearts in their professed religion, or the essence of protestant religion and liberty in their hearts-if they were as honest and ardent as O'Connell, they, too, would be liberators, and would deserve their titles, and the affections of the nation. As it is with the most of them, however, a demagogue dinner or a military funeral will amply repay them for all the good or glory they have done or won for their country. Or if we contrast his conduct with that of his famous neighbor, who died almost in company with him, how nobly his rejection of the slaveholders' contributions to the repeal fund, rebukes the acceptance of their subscription to the treasury of the Free Church of Scotland. O'Connell and Chalmers stood in equal relation to the question and the occasion-the papist politician spoke out for humanity -the puritan priest pocketed the money and left the slave in the hands of his master unrebuked!! Alive, the Liberator's heart was in the right place; his work finished, his duty to men done, it is a small matter where its ashes may rest. 
                
                
                  FANATICISM. 
                  LAMARTINE happily defines it "the enthusiam of virtue." Dull, practical people, who are prudent and safe, because they are really capable of nothing but routine, despise and scorn it. Wise men may as earnestly avoid it, but they better know its force and meaning. They remember that Mahomedanism got itself established, notwithstanding its dreams and delusions; and that Oliver Cromwell and his army were none the less terrible, none the less efficient, for their absurdities of doctrine and "foolishness of preaching." The puritan pioneers of New England were nearly insane in the matter of witchcraft and all sorts of diablerie, but they did their work, nevertheless, with a witness. In our own day Mormonism has really founded a State. No matter about the folly of their religious belief, and notwithstanding the alleged dishonesty, vulgarity and profligacy of their prophet; notwithstanding all they lost and all they suffered in Illinois, there was ever that in them which secured success. They had an idea that could be worked into a fact, a truth which would stand a trial-the brotherhood of men actually reduced to practice. 
                  No man or party ever tried to incarnate an abstract truth in their life without encountering the charge of fanaticism, and getting charged besides with all sorts of heresies and immoralities; and no such man or party ever failed to vindicate dicate their position at last. The journeymen tailors of New York, and the Wall street brokers, are employing the profoundest idea of an enthusiastic faith, without knowing whence it cometh or whither it goeth. 
                  The brotherhood of men, a commercial policy! even so. At the two extremes of the business world we have it-in banks of discount and deposit, and in our public poorhouses! The stockholders in effect say that unity of capital and harmony of effort (which is the brotherhood of business), and community of risks and benefits, is the highest policy in pecuniary enterprises. They are sound in the faith that all things shall be added unto those who seek the kingdom of heaven on earth, and, with a view to the inevitable gain, they lay down all hostilities of feeling and interest, and go into-not apostolic, but-stock-jobbing and money-making community of goods; and just as far as they do go, the promise is fulfilled to them, for it is a promise of science, and results from the regular laws of the Universe. 
                  It is a law of life, as well as a dogma of religious faith. Steamboats are run upon the Delaware on the same principle. The people agree tacitly to make common cause of it, and consent to travel together as close packed as comfort will allow, and to drop all distinctions for the time being, except those which decency demands; and accordingly, they can travel in a floating palace, twenty miles in an hour, for a shilling! That is realizing the benefits of brotherhood in another way-in the way of economy for necessities and luxuries, cheapened down almost to the capacities of beggary itself. 
                  In like manner, the inhabitants of the poorest village in the country, when they so far fraternize, find it easy to build the finest house and the costliest in the town for use only a couple of hours of one day in the week. Indeed, churches and steamboats can be had on no other terms; and the uncounted millions expended in canals, railroads, lighthouses, arsenals, bridges and battles, are scarcely felt by the community, simply because they are accomplished by the community principle. 
                  Here are startling demonstrations of the practicability of that fanaticism which asserts the actual, everyday business-brotherhood of men. Capital is familiarly the subject of the corporative principle. It remains only to put Labor also into the same policy and method. Armies, cotton plantations and cotton factories, show the principle in bondage, and demonstrate fully what a Samson strength it has. When the world has learned how to organize labor emancipated, labor associated, labor in wedlock with capital, and joint owner as well as joint producer of the issue, all men will see that the realized fraternity of the race will answer to that high promise, "all these things (to wit, what we shall eat, what we shall drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed) will be added unto you;" and men will be able then, for the first time, to "take no thought for the morrow," and to "give to him that asketh, and from him who would borrow turn not away." 
                  Fanaticism, indeed! Why, to men that have neither faith nor philosophy, heaven itself is a dream, harmony a humbug, and human nature, after all, a flat failure. But to the man that has either, there is no abstract truth incapable of practical use; to him the highest good is the simplest truth. In Scripture language, fool means one who says there is no God, and in the vocabulary of a sound philosophy scoffer and fool are exactly synonymous. 
                  It is the business of ignorance not to blaspheme but to worship the things that are above it. Every honest heart knows by instinct that whatever is beautiful is true. It is a dungeon bosom and a foggy head that cannot understand our theme-Fanaticism is the enthusiasm of virtue.
                   
                  If the blessings of brotherhood were a miracle, and meant approbation of the recipients in all things, then perhaps bankers, and railroad corporations, and armies, and cotton-fields, and churches, would not illustrate it. But it is a matter of natural law, and pirates must have the benefit of it as well as the purest and noblest associations. Nay, it is just because it is looked upon as a spirituality, that it has not yet become more generally a fact in the lives of men. But it is coming-the guarantee movements of the age are its harbinger. Men get their goods, houses, lives, insured. They join companies that insure their morals and their bread and butter at the same time. They take the pledge of brotherhood, and get the answering pledge of support in sickness, and protection for their children. The hospital and the poorhouse, which barbarism regards as an impracticable fanaticism, are not good enough for the poor of civilization now. They are asking life, and its comforts as justice, and refusing them as charity. But they are taking a higher step-not steadily nor assuredly-but they are staggering into steadiness; they are clubbing their energies and means, and striving to be their own masters and employers. 
                  Civil freedom, political equality (other impracticable fanaticisms), sometime realized now by the mass, are no longer good enough for them; they want industrial liberty, personal, actual freedom, and self-government. And this impracticable fanaticism will also be realized whenever they get good enough and wise enough. The whole economy of human existence is the subject of law; the conditions secured, the result is certain; and, on the other hand, the conditions of a hope wanting, it is doomed to inevitable failure. 
                
                
                   
                  EXPERIENCE. 
                  EXPERIENCE without theory is experience not understood-a mere jumble of luck and blunder-a hump-backed beggar with a wallet of rags and cold victuals on its back-a burly blind, old vagabond, led by a dog, and supported on a crutch, in perpetual repetition of the same journeyings. Bah! Your practical people who disavow their own brains and sneer at other people's, are only fit for the tread-mill. It is the nurse disputing with the physician; it is the carthorse, with the bit in his teeth, settling the route against the driver. 
                
                
                  "A FANATIC." 
                  AS for our "fanaticism," that is a word instead of an argument-a substitute for reason. It has about the force of the word papist, heretic, madman, infidel, when used in controversy. Pronounced from a proper judgment-seat it might effect something, but in debate it is not begging the question only, but confessing that it must be begged or lost. Besides, we have very little objection to the epithet, it almost always means unhesitating clearness and courageous maintenance of opinion. 
                  Whenever the truth sends a sword upon the earth, its earnest servants are told that they have a devil, and the charge is always the most positively made when they are busiest in casting them out. We do not mean nor insinuate any malignity in our neighbor editors: they are probably doing and saying what they must; nor do we intimate any disrespect for wholesome conservatism and well-principled expediency, but we do insist that there is a very wide gulf between the right and the wrong. When their extremes are reached, compromising, at that point, is only a desperate attempt to tunnel the stream that neither angel nor demon is permitted to swim. 
                
                
                  SLAVES 
                  have a real fear of liberty; they feel the security as well as the restraint of their chains; and cripples have great confidence in their crutches. It is not mere hatred of good that makes the darkness reject the light; the world receives it not because it does not comprehend it. Wait a little longer. 
                
                
                  KOSSUTH. 
                  KOSSUTH has returned to Europe. He has seen the people of the United States, and they have seen him, but from very different points of observation, with very unlike powers of perception and understanding, and with corresponding varieties of opinion. To him that hath shall be given, an he can receive only that which is like himself. A dog or a horse understands just so much of his master's ideas and instincts as he has in common with him, and men can know only that which they comprehend. All beyond is hidden. We have no other measure for that which is above us than our own limits, and our own motives are the only springs of action which we can imagine. Each individual lays his own outlines over the subject of his judgment, and if that subject falls within himself he comprehends it; but if it spreads beyond, he is confused, or, mistaking a part for the whole, he sees nothing truly, for he sees nothing entirely. He that stands highest sees most. The best man and the largest nature are the wisest. As in art, so in mind and morals, the highest endowed has the best rule of judgment, and is nearest the absolute standard. A wise man comprehends a fool; an honest man understands a rogue; for he has within himself all those things whose partialism, perversion and abuse, are the subjects of his judgment. The simply good occupy a vantage-ground for the action of their intellect which enlarges its grasp; and, it is given to the faith of a sound heart to apprehend much of the excellence of that wisdom which otherwise might baffle the mere understanding, as Mary, the sister of Lazarus, loved herself into the mystery of the Crucifixion before the apostles could at all comprehend it. She "anointed him unto his burial," while they yet fondly thought "it was he who was to redeem Israel" from the Roman yoke! 
                  But with respect to men who are not the prophets of a future age, delivering the abstractions of truth and hope, but the pivot-men of their own time, and obliged to accommodate the highest doctrines of truth to existing conditions, for pressing practical uses, a just judgment is every way difficult; because, principles are involved with circumstances, and the chances and changes of affairs are the most important elements in the problem. 
                  It must have puzzled the Jewish populace not a little to see Jesus accepting baptism from John, while he claimed to be the Messiah-observing the ordinances of the temple, and threatening its overthrow-paying tribute to Csar, and claiming to be the King of Kings-denouncing the priests, and directing his own disciples "to observe and do whatsoever they commanded"-and conforming generally to the order of things which he proposed to overturn; but, setting government, law, and the established religion, all at naught, in matters most essential to their authority. 
                  First principles are as clear to children as to the angels; but their application in the conduct of a heroic life opens room for much doubt and mistake, and modesty in judgment of such instances is the safest guide to justice; indeed, largeness of heart is as well proved by its loving confidence as by its enlightenment-"Now we know in part, and prophesy in part, but we shall know even as we are known when that which is perfect is come." Let the apostle's philosophy serve for our caution. 
                  The time for judging Kossuth has not yet come. Our sons may build the tombs of the prophets whom we reject. Events are the best tests of great enterprises. Even failure may prove our reproach, and not his condemnation. It is not certain that he understood the American people perfectly. He may have seen us in the light of his own enthusiasm. He may have addressed himself to our ideal rather than to our actual character. No matter-the Sermon on the Mount is still waiting for the world's adjustment to its pitch of apprehension. It is not even certain that he fully knows the people of Europe whom he represents. He was mistaken in the French. He did not believe that they would sustain Louis Napoleon as they have done, though it was not at all impossible for a people who gave five millions of votes to a monkey in 1848, to give the additional compliment of two millions more to a monster in 1851. The counter-working of that despotism postponed his hope, and checked his action, but disappointment with such a man is never despair. His faith is well based, nevertheless; for in well-disposed circumstances the masses are as poetical and heroic as their leaders; and, if they are more the creatures of circumstance, and disposed to abjectness in reverses, they are ever brave and generous under their critical inspirations. Impulse and organization determine their action and drift, and these are at the command of the governing minds. Such minds know their own power. Kossuth's confidence is not shaken by such events as decide the opinions and hopes of men below his rank. He can make a revolution, and he can command it. Everything human is possible to him, and he knows it both by faith and experience. He has seen it demonstrated. The law of progress works; human nature itself is pledged to it, and the hour hastens for a new manifestation, which will yet verify the hopes of that heroic heart, which clings, by a necessity of his nature and mission, to its great prophesies and stands ready to fulfil them. 
                  Living or dying, Kossuth must conquer. His mistakes of men and times are as nothing; they are but the misapprehensions of accidents; he relies upon the law of things which is permanent. If he expected too much from us-more than results have yet justified, he nevertheless did his own work wisely and well-better by looking to the heart than upon the surfaces of things. He dealt with principles, and facts must, sooner or later, fulfil them. The hearts of all men answer to the impulses of his heart, and their hands will, in fitting circumstances, assuredly accomplish all his desires. 
                  A truth received is a prediction, and however, or however long postponed, history will one day write it down a fact. 
                  Intervention is as clear a duty as the golden rule; it is the golden rule in a national application. It rests upon us as a responsibility of our position. It may come to us as a measure of immediate interest, or it may wait till we have grown into the grace of a generous compliance; but come it will; and then, instead of appealing to precedents, we will make our apology and perform our duty. Would that we were in better adjustment to it. If the despotisms, ecclesiastical and political, which press upon us were but a little better resisted, we should be ready to succor the oppressed nations of the earth with effect. 
                  His mission has exposed the enmity that there is among us to the principle of self-government, and conviction will work conversion, if salvation is possible. The creed of our home tyrants has been enlarged by the discussion, and the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Law have taken non-intervention into their fitting fellowship. The parties which would padlock our lips against abuses at home, desire also to repress our philanthropy abroad. It is well. The great wrong has enlisted against itself another generous sympathy of the American heart, and brought redress that much nearer and surer.

                  VIVE LA BAGATELLE. 
                  "FRANCE is quiet," says the telegraphic abstract of the latest news. This has been the form of the reports ever since the coup d'tat of Louis Napoleon. The Telegraph evidently expected something else, and is as much astonished as copper, zinc and vitriol can be, that, with such electrical mobility of constitution, the French nation holds its thunder under so complete control. France has shown, in time past, that she could astonish a galvanic battery with her explosions, also. In truth, neither batteries nor brains can match her performances, or measure her movements. She is an astonishment, and, in the language of the Old Testament, "a hissing and a by-word among the nations." 
                  The population of France is thirty-five millions; of these creatures, about one million are within the walls of Paris, and that million is the machinery by which the nation is managed, at the will, alternately, of the mobs, mountebanks, manikins, monkeys, and men, who attend to the business of revolutionizing la grande nation! Centralization so absolute and intense has no existence elsewhere; nor are its results anywhere else so striking and so absurd. No healthy man's head governs his body so despotically. A live limb has more independent instincts than any sub-city or rural department of the commonwealth. No man beyond the walls of the metropolis knows whether he is a citizen of the Republic, a subject of the Empire, or an atom of political dust, kicked up in an unsettled revolutionary row, until the arrival of the next post; nor does he seem to care. He is a conscript born and bred; he belongs, body and soul, to the Government, and may be relied upon to vote and fight under drill, like an automaton. In 1848, they gave five millions of votes to the name of a dead Emperor. In 1851, they added the compliment of a couple of millions, by way of doing due honor to their pet's presumption, perjury and usurpation. 
                  When, in 1848, the Provisional Government maintained a decent republic for three months, we made the mistake of supposing, because there were evident good reasons for the submission of the people, that it was the reason of the nation which ruled its conduct, and indulged the corresponding hope; but the submission of the last four months reminds us anew, that French nature and human nature are not the same thing; nor will the analogies of Anglo-American philosophy any way help the solution of the conundrum of French history. We are entirely free from prejudice so foolish as a groundless national aversion; but we confess to such indignation and contempt as ardent hopes disappointed, and earnest principles outraged, may justify. Her infamous history was not forgotten; but we fondly hoped a new era had brought her a better destiny. Four years ago, she stood, for a brief period, the model nation of the world. "Now lies she there, and none so poor to do her reverence!" 
                  There are, for there must be, explanations of all this, that will leave us our confidence in mankind undiminished. In 1844, of her thirty-four and a half millions, seventeen millions (in round numbers) were unable to read or write; seven millions able to read, but not to write; seven millions read and wrote incorrectly; two and a half millions read and and wrote correctly; three-quarters of a million had the elements of a classical education; and three hundred and fifteen thousand had a complete classical education. These statistics of her ignorance are scarcely a match for those of her crime; and the poverty of the masses is as deep and hopeless as naturally belongs to her barbarism and profligacy. 
                  Her brag writers claim that she is "the centre, the focus, of the civilization of Europe;" and there are people better born and bred who echo the eulogy. In fact, she ever has been and still is the foe of civilization-the worst existing enemy of human progress herself, and a tool of the most malignant despotisms of the earth. Italy, Spain, the Nether lands, Holland, have had their progress to better conditions and happier fortunes again and again arrested by her, and she has been the perpetual enemy of the free cities of Germany. No country within her baleful proximity has escaped its mischief. She inflicted the feudal system upon Europe ten centuries ago, and is now the chief instrument in the endeavor to restore the despotism of the darkest ages of religion and government over the whole Continent. 
                  Feudal or Free, Monarchical or Republican, it is all alike; and her proscription of the Huguenots, the atrocities of St. Bartholomew, and the crime and misery of her first revolution, are all of a piece; and after sending fifty thousand troops, as one of the first public acts of the new Republic, to crush the liberties of Rome, we ought not to be surprised at the coup d'tat of December last, or the base quietude of the country under it. Of course, we shall have the news of another mob, some day soon, or of an assassination at least, and may be, another form of bastard republic; but it will be more French than actual, whatever shape the substantial lie may take. 
                  Guizot claims for France that ideas always precede and impel the progress of the social order; that, doctrine goes before realization, and mind is always in the lead of movement. All of which is very true, but in a different sense from that of the admiring author; ideas, mind, and doctrine, are always active; but the evil is, that things do not follow, facts do not fulfil theories, and all the resulting movement is bustle and fuss, without progression. The rambling freedom of research, the incessant activity of speculation of the French mind, indicate in fact, how completely it has lost its way in the matter of political and social philosophy. They are in the wilderness, without a pathway, and their running to and fro, in every direction, only indicates their confusion. Men are not perpetually inquiring for a road, until they have lost it; and it is valetudinarians, not healthy men, who are most concerned about their health, and busiest in search of remedies. 
                  A country most renowned for system making is one in which the few do the thinking, and the many disregard it. System-making may well flourish in a nation that can do up a revolution in three days, twice in eighteen years, and, after four more, go through another in as many hours! Speculative tive novelties ought to abound where the practice is so easy. Within seventy years the people have performed insurrections through every conceivable phase of tragedy and farce, until at last, to fill up all the possibilities of caprice and perfidy, the President rose en masse upon the people, and put them down. He dissolved their Assembly, which was good for nothing, indeed, but none the less worthy of the constituency; decreed a constitution, an election, suppressed the free press, banished the non-conformists, established the empire and its handmaid religion, and now, in anticipation of the next Assembly, has decreed the budget! A people to whom such things can be done, of whom they can be conceived, lie well out upon the borders of human nature, and must be held worthy of their fate. The only thing that gives them, any place or force in the programme of human affairs is, that while they are not fit to live, they are always ready to die; and so they come to be what Kossuth calls a Power upon earth, which the earth is doomed to feel to its cost for some centuries to come. 
                  All this sort of thing it is well worth a man's while to say over to himself occasionally, for the least admiration of La Grande Nation is very likely to make a fool of him when he may most need his wits. The Empire of Hayti is just as respectable in all essential qualities of national character as France, and Soulouque was the prophesy of Louis Napoleon, his Counterpart, and arose out of the same state and quality of things. No republic, white or black, could pass into a mere despotism, in this age, unless it were French.

               POLITICO-ECONOMICAL. 
                
                  POLITICAL GOVERNMENT. 
                  MONARCHY, Aristocracy, Democracy, are the principal forms of political government. 
                  In a Monarchy, government is exercised, laws are made and executed, by the authority and will of one individual. This form may be either elective or hereditary. Autocracy describes a monarchy in which the prince rules by himself without a ministry, council or advice. Originally, despot and tyrant meant only master and monarch; but the abuse of power, so held, brought the words to imply cruel and oppressive governors or rulers. King primitively signified wise man, and the title was bestowed to designate the eminently wise man of the community. 
                  An Aristocracy is government by the nobles. It is also either hereditary or elective. The Feudal system had all the qualities of an Aristocracy. 
                  Monarchy and Aristocracy, in their various forms, and in various mixtures of them, claim to be the best modes of securing ORDER in society; and they base this pretension upon their greater efficiency, and the higher wisdom of their functionaries. 
                  Democracy is the special guardian of LIBERTY. A simple Democracy is a government of the people by the directest est agencies. Representative Republicanism, while it respects the self-government of every individual as a leading principle, imposes more or less incapacity, and interposes, also, more embarrassments than the simplest and purest liberty would allow. The argument of inconvenience is alleged, and so, incompetency is managed without being offended, and the will of the people gets expression only in emergencies when, from some extraordinary cause, the community is aroused to assert it. Servants, to whom government is delegated, are under the same temptations to abuse the trust that masters are to whom it is surrendered; but, as they are responsible, and elective at short periods, they must rely upon fraud, instead of force, to accomplish their ends. 
                  Democracy rests upon the innate right of all men to self-government. It is worthy of note that in New York, where suffrage is freest, only one-fifth of the population are qualified voters, and the Commonwealth is governed by a majority of these, or one-tenth of its people. In representative democracies of the freest form the incapacities of nonage, sex, alienage, and imprisonment for crime, disqualify four-fifths of the people for the exercise of citizenship. 
                  All existing forms of government thus sacrifice or repress liberty to secure order. Absolutism, feudalism, republicanism, alike, have their arguments for government by the wisest and the best. The difference in practical results, is immense-as great as the difference between the one and the hundred or the million mass; but still they agree in the principle, that some natural rights must be surrendered in order to secure the rest. They differ in the extent, but not in the principle of their respective demands. 
                  Liberty and order have long been supposed incompatible; but they are not so; else, men must either be slaves or demons. There is something, an element in each of the forms of government which we have enumerated, that is capable of agreement and harmony with something essential to each of the others. What each form affirms consistently with that which is affirmed by every other is true; what they contradict in each other is false. Monarchy is unity of purpose exerted through a single exponent of the public will. This is true; but, when monarchy denies individual liberty, it is false. So, popular freedom is true, but when it denies unity of purpose it is disorder. Hereditary Aristocracy is so far true as it affirms the physiological descent of high qualities from parent to child as a general law. It is false, when it claims government as an appanage of birth without respect to qualification. 
                  A true order would provide the government of the wisest and best on earth as in heaven, and so as to secure individual liberty, and guarantee the supply of the natural wants, and the highest culture to each and to all. 
                
                
                  GOVERNMENT-POLITICAL AND NATURAL. 
                  DEMOCRACY affirms that "the world is governed too much," and that "that is the best government which governs least." If this principle is strong enough to carry all its consequences, it is then true that no government at all would be the perfection of political science. This doctrine, however, is checked up by that other general principle-government is necessary to the protection of the weak against the strong, and for the general good order and safety of society. To this end organic laws, called state constitutions, are formed, which protect the minority by tying up the hands of the majority in the very teeth of the principle, that the right of government is in the greater number of voices. 
                  Here we have a pretty parcel of apparent contradictions; to wit: The least governing is best, but the completed and consummated idea, no government at all, is absurd! The majority has the right to rule, and is the only legitimate method of settling the right and wrong of any question which concerns civil life and conduct, but-constitutions must be adopted to secure the weak, the rights of the weak, against that RIGHT! Can these things be reconciled? 
                  We think that all these propositions are in their way true. Self-government is everywhere encroached upon by the political power; everything ordained or forbidden by the municipal law is so much taken away from the freedom of the subject. Consulting the individual's liberty only, the least governing is best, and none at all the best of al; but this must be understood only of government by the majority of voices, which rules in the sole right of numbers, and enforces its will with pains and penalties. When men are utterly rid of that sort of government they will be better and happier than they are; but they must be better and happier before they can be rid of it. 
                  Government is indeed necessary to the protection of the weak, and constitutions are necessary in democracies to guard the rights of the minority; but it does not follow that government and constitutions must be political and separated, as they now are, into a distinct function. The general organic action of society might be made to answer all the ends of life, and the office and use of political government might be fulfilled perfectly, by the regular and integral activities of such natural organization. The family, as nature institutes it, has no distinctive apparatus of political system in its economy. The parents levy no taxes-they take all the children's labor. They reserve to themselves no separate aims and interests-they give all they have in return. Parents and children have each their individuality and all its incidents, but they are in effect a unit, a family. Conflicting rights are not jumbled into a paradox to afford protection to the Weak; the principles of the societary structure devote all the kinds of strength in the strongest to the service of the weak; the elder serve the younger. The father charges no salary for his services to the little community, and the mother runs up no milk bills against her babies. 
                  Here is one good government without a supplementary political apparatus. 
                  Cannot Democracy find some way of organizing the human family, which will really recognize the natural brotherhood? Can it not find some method of action which will really protect the weak and nurse them too, and that without contradicting one of its fundamental principles by another? Now, that it has fairly overthrown the one-man power, we next need to have the despotism of majorities dethroned; we need some better method of determining the right than by counting noses; and some mode of making every man; competent to every act of government which he must exercise in the general economy. 
                  Democracy will never be self-adjusted, nor self-justified, till it has organized institutions in which all its instincts are harmonized in a natural order. 
                  The compromise of "the greatest good of the greatest; number," is as meagre and mean as the policy of the old; time feudalisms. Every system of slavery in the world rests upon this pretence. It is purposely false in some of them; it is in effect false in all systems which acknowledge it. It is the rights of all, the greatest good of all, which the world demands at the hands of world menders and managers. 
                  It is curious that the New Testament, which is the very gospel of liberty, gives no authority to the representative republican system. Is not this because the Great Reformer looked with impartial eye upon all political systems, allowing them all, preferring none, except as it is adapted to induce the permanent, the divine, order of actual brotherhood? He could not sanction, fully, any system that allows any man to prey upon his fellow man. 
                
                
                  GOVERNMENT, AN ACCIDENT-OUGHT TO BE A SCIENCE. 
                  THERE must be a Science of Society. Men have a determinate nature. The structure of the human body is the same in the Egyptian Mummy as in the latest born individual of the race. Every age has exhibited virtues and vices substantially the same. And the nations are only so many translations of humanity into different climates and conditions, all meaning the same things in different ways. It is clear that man is the creature of law, and that his freedom does not alter his constitution, however it affects his conduct; and it follows, that the relations of men, which shape themselves into Societies and Governments, have also a fixed character, and are not to be invented, but only await discovery by human research. Man has not made himself, and he cannot, in any essential, change himself; his interests and happiness lie in conforming his institutions and conduct to his nature, and so fulfilling the will of the Creator, instead of following his own caprices. 
                   
                  The duties men owe to each other, the rights which they have with respect to each other, must be matters of natural law and divine constitution; and government cannot owe its origin to compact, or to any perception of the mutual advantages which it is capable of affording; nor, can it be founded in experience of the evils of what is called "the state of nature." 
                  Writers have been accustomed to treat society as a conventional arrangement, and its policy as an expediency merely; but this is manifestly absurd. Historically, it is false, and, philosophically, it is impossible. It is monstrous to imagine that God made every man without any reference to any other, and left him to form such relations as he could with his brother man, without providing for the harmonies of order in his constitutional instincts. It is false, because the so-called state of nature never existed anywhere. One or two idiots and misanthropists, in a generation, have lived alone; but men are as naturally societary as the flocks of the air and the herds of the field. It is unphilosophical, because no such effects as human societies could exist without the special causes in the nature of man that are fitted to produce them; and it is disastrous to human welfare to leave the relative rights and duties of men open to the quackery of experiment, deprived of the authority of the Governing Mind, and the homage and obedience due to the acknowledged will of the Creator. 
                  And sorely has the human family suffered, and grievously has it sinned, in this ignorance. Popular authors have taught, until they have made the opinion popular, that men, on entering into society, must surrender certain natural rights in order to secure themselves in the enjoyment of others. If this necessity were attributed to its true cause, and so understood, it would not be so bad; but, laid down as philosophical cal truth, it is every way pernicious. For the notion that we must give up some-an unlimited and indefinite number-of our rights, in order to enjoy the remainder, is all that despotism wants to stamp itself orthodox, and make it duty, patriotism, and religion to submit to its villainous exactions. The fool or rogue who invented that phrase may boast a success in mischief, that must put to the blush the pretensions of that other fool or rogue who tempted our Saviour in the wilderness with just such other oracles of moral and political policy. 
                  Concede to the governing class the surrender of any right as a price paid for the enjoyment of any other, and we have perpetrated a double folly-we have given up a right, and we have meanly purchased permission to enjoy another right! That is, we have thrown away much, and reserved nothing in its sacredness; we have put everything at hazard, and consented to hold our birthright by contract with some other pieces of just such clay as we ourselves are made of. The consequence is, that rulers have charged just what they pleased for taking care of those who were unwise enough to grant them the power for the sake of the favor. No form of slavery is intrinsically meaner, though some others may feel worse. 
                  It is certain that government must arise out of the human constitution, to be adapted to it-that its forms must answer to the nature of the subjects, and its ends to their wants, with exactness and truth; and, it follows, that any particular form is false in principle to the extent that it is deficient and injurious in effects. This in its turn involves the necessity of a true philosophy of human nature; for nothing less or other than a perfect system of mental and moral philosophy can be a true basis for the science of society. To adjust men to each other harmoniously, in all their relations, we must know all their nature, understand all their faculties, and respect all their rights, so ascertained. 
                  The wheels of a machine must be truly placed and related, or they will damage each other in the working, and in the same degree, disappoint the general end intended. It is not true that one must suffer a crush, and another lose a cog, in order that a third and a fourth may get room to swing out of their place, and a fifth to revolve slower in its appointed; task than equal distribution of motion requires. On the contrary, all counter working is disastrous, and all friction is so much loss of power in the whole and in all the parts. It is the same in societies. Capacities ought to determine spheres and regulate functions, and the general system should find a place for all. The conceit that a sacrifice must be incurred at every turn, in order to square the movements of the whole, is no better than a confession that the machinery is not made fit to work upon the principles of its construction-in other words, that it is self-destructive. 
                  The system of political economy now in use has happened as a result of experiment, accident, conquest and compromise. Early errors produced permanent evils; revolutions abated their sharpest and most obvious mischiefs, and altered their forms. Necessity taught some truths and philosophy revealed some others; but monstrous grievances have always been tolerated, for the reason of their vested rights, or, the difficulty of overturning them. The notion that society is a matter of compact, and that policy is a system of compromise, has always been present to sanctify abuses and check radical, reforms. The eternal right has been ever postponed to the conflicting claims of custom and possession. Government as it is, is only a cunning contexture of cobbled expediencies. There is not a government on the earth that knows whether it ought to educate its people or not, or, the reason for doing so, in any case where popular sentiment has induced some plan of elementary instruction in literature and science. The true theory is not known, or it would be known how far such education should be carried; and it would be done as early and determinedly as rivers and harbors, and roads and fortifications, are improved and constructed for public convenience. The men who insist most upon common schools, cannot answer why instruction should or should not be extended to all the arts, useful and ornamental, and to all professions and avocations, as well as to letters and arithmetic. Just because the principle is not understood, its limitations in practice are not known, though its force is, in some blind, partial way. Perceived. 
                  Again, no man can tell why, upon principle, Church and State should be separated; and it is, therefore, not known why Sunday should be kept, or how, nor how and why it should be enforced. But, especially, no one can give a reason for separating religion from politics, nor the Church from the State, because, he cannot find any such separation and independence of religion and morality in the constitution of any individual man. And as the whole man is the subject of political government, and every act of duty involves its religious reason and obligation, as well as its sentiment of fraternal right, it is a curious jugglery of judgment that excludes from the government of the mass what must always exist in the conduct of each individual of that mass. 
                  Above all things, theorists tell us that society rose out of the savage state, in which every man is every other man's enemy, and lies in wait to take his property and life; and yet, they construct their system on the principle of a perpetual antagonism, reduced from the confusion of chance and accident, to the settled order of a regular competition. The whole scheme of our institutions and relations being nothing else than a warfare of interests, under an armistice which is to continue until one or other of the parties makes too much advantage of the rules given it to work by for its own interests; and then the system allows a resort to first principles again, or the employment of force, and revolutions are sanctioned by the very philosophy which upholds government! The prevailing compromise of Paganism and Christianity does not hesitate to teach the duty of obedience to the laws of the State, whatever conscience may say, and at the same time holds, that the people, or any part of the people, who are strong enough, may overturn the law-making power, at any expense of life and peace. A system that enjoins both obedience and rebellion, can have no pretence to a philosophical basis, or, to the character of a true thing. 
                  Societies, as they are constituted, allow a million, a thousand, a hundred men, to monopolize the entire soil of the country. They have no science of prevention, and they have no power of cure; and poor-houses and prisons are witnesses of their impotency and of their barbarism. Civilization is a compliment that all nations pay themselves. The Jews, the Romans, the Chinese, have plumed themselves upon it, and why not the European people; and why should it mean more in our case than in theirs? 
                
                
                  POLITICS-PRINCIPLE vs. PRACTICE. 
                  THE establishment of the French Empire, with its almost autocratic Constitution, is of evil omen. It stands upon popular suffrage, indeed, and so far confesses the popular sovereignty in theory; in effect it is a nullified abstraction; but even if the principle held its latent force for the proper occasions, it is no more promising for future changes than the intrinsic instability of the French character. The first Napoleon and the Citizen King, Louis Philippe, as well as the present usurper, broke through the rule of legitimacy with impunity. The Dutch dynasty of England obtained the crown by election, in the revolution of 1688; and again, the Hanoverian succession was settled by Parliament, representing the people, in 1701. 
                  The catastrophe of Louis Napoleon's coronation is not at all relieved by the fact of his election to the throne. Monarchy is but little concerned about the links in its chain of title, if only its conditions and powers are satisfactorily settled. The coup d'tat of December, 1851, was very cordially received by the despotisms of Europe; and the Empire is already formally acknowledged by all the Kingdoms and States concerned in the matter; and nothing threatens disturbance to the present order, or promises advantages to popular liberty, in the immediate future, except conflicts of interest and ambition among the rulers themselves. The refugee republicans of 1848 are in the deepest despair. 
                  Nations, like individuals, feel oppression, and resist it, either in a passion, or with a purpose based upon principle, as may result from their character or from circumstances. Insurrections and rebellions are as natural as disobedience; they are often nothing else. Communities are made up of individuals, and are just so much more of the same thing; and it depends upon intrinsic character whether a successful rising turns out a revolution or a row.
                   
                  Forms of government are questions of blood and creed, more than is commonly thought. Republican freedom and the spirit of Protestantism, or the right of self-government in civil affairs and of private judgment in religion, go together, and illustrate the results of race and creed combined, both in the ancient world and in the modern. Infidel Greece, Rome, and France, and Protestant Britain and America, show a similar repugnance to the divine right of Hierarchy and Monarchy. The historic examples show that the religious institutions and the civil constitution of a people correspond closely. Blood and temperament are not so steady, though they give the law and control the destiny in the long run, however they may occasionally suffer a temporary suspension of influence. The people who appoint their Priests will elect their Governors. A Protestant Prince is but a symbol of sovereignty; the Executive Ministry must represent and obey the Commons. Ecclesiastical independence and supremacy consorts with political absolutism. Governments, sacred and secular, which do not ask the people's leave to be, on the one side-on the other, Rulers and Priests, mere ministers of the popular will. Thus, those nations who form their own religion, and those who acknowledge none, are politically free, Freedom in religion makes unbelief possible. Submission to authority secures faith, and, tends to superstition and slavery in all its forms. Atheism and Fetichism are respectively the ultimate abuses of which the opposite principles are capable in religion; in politics, they run out respectively into pure democracy and absolute despotism. 
                  There may be an absolutely best form of Government for all men, but it is, nevertheless, clear that special adaptation and present practicability decide the relative excellence of systems for the various kindreds of men. It is not a question whether freedom is best, for every people, but, how freedom and order can best be balanced, where a people are less capable; and harmonized, where they are fully fitted for democratic institutions. 
                  It is very certain that more than twenty centuries ago the rights of man were well enough understood to get a fair recognition in the forms of civil government among highly cultured people. Some of the ancient States were very pure democracies. Among barbarous tribes, civil liberty, suffrage, and eligibility are almost universal. Fitness is right with them. Perhaps the masses are never anywhere without the knowledge of the first principles of political justice, or indifferent to the advantages of personal and civil freedom. If it can be said of our slaves, that they so far desire, as to be capable of, enfranchisement, the sentiment cannot be denied to any people under the sun. Mere selfishness and wilfulness are enough to inspire the wish; and a very little understanding is sufficient to underpin it with logical principles. Doubtless, the aspiration for liberty is instinctive in every human breast; and among every people there is philosophy enough to digest the impulse into a system of doctrines. 
                  Democracy is, therefore, not a discovery so recent, or so local, that its happy realization among us must needs be followed like a brilliant star just risen, in the heaven of human hope. A few wise men of the East may come to worship where the young child is laid in its cradle, but the nations will pursue their favorite idolatries none the less. 
                  Psychological constitution, climate and other material conditions determine the social and civil institutions of men, Monarchy suits not with one kindred, democracy is ill-suited to another. These differences, with their intervening shades, are demonstrated by a sufficient experience, and they seem inevitable because they are constitutional; but there is no ground in all this for despair; oppression is not therefore the fixed fate of any people. 
                  Feudalism reigned over all central Europe during the middle ages. It must have had some sort and degree of adaptation to the people, and some correspondence to their necessities sities and interests-even to the very lineage from which our own republicanism springs. Somehow our freedom grew up in that bondage; and the fact that such slavery and such emancipation and freedom are true of the same stock of men, though separated by a long interval and many changes, suggests the possibility and the prospect of some harmonious mixture of these antagonist forms, which may combine their several adaptations, and give us an eventual higher form of civil polity than any yet known-the feudal order to adjust government to the varied capabilities of the subjects, the democratic principle of election or appointment, modified in some fashion, which shall secure the essential liberty of the subject, while the elective franchise is guarded against the abuse of incompetency. Such conciliation of liberty and order is certainly not impossible, for, if it were, the equities of civil rights and the obligations of civil duty must remain impracticable among men till the millenium-a doctrine not to be tolerated, because it justifies oppression, and makes the wrongs of the masses inevitable, and therefore relatively just. 
                  Democracy, direct or representative, is possible and expedient in the most advanced societies, for its mature members; but in a high civilization, with its vast interests and complex functions, about four-fifths of the population are excluded from the exercise of government by the legal disqualifications of sex, minority, and alienage. In New York, where suffrage is nearly what is called universal, only one-fifth of the whole people are voters. In England, Wales, and Scotland, the number of registered voters in 1851 was but one in forty-one of the whole population (half a million out of twenty-one millions), and the votes actually polled in 1852 were but one in sixty-seven. 
                  The abstract principle that, Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, as yet, receives only a constructive, and not a practical or veritable, allowance in the freest Governments of the earth. It is obvious that representative democracy, as we have it, is not capable, even among ourselves, of a rigid realization. How much less so in southern Europe, the East Indies, and Africa! Republican America has not yet discovered or employed the method by which every one of the governed may have an actual voice in his own government; because, by our system, the suffrage in general elections also confers the power upon each voter of governing others as well as himself; and for this, a safe amount of qualification is required, and the exclusion of the incompetent rendered expedient and necessary. 
                  Such a system always fails where the masses are ignorant and degraded, as in Mexico and France; witness in the latter, seven millions of votes for the new Empire, and a half million of soldiers to enforce the people's will upon themselves! 
                  The puzzle is, that the broad principle is true, but the conforming fact quite impracticable in the circumstances where it is required; and the mischief is, that the constant failures in endeavored realization cheat the revolutionists of their hope, and shake the faith of just men in the great truth which they worship. 
                  If I leave these points stand as an unresolved riddle, the facts of history are just as perplexing. The truths involved serve only for criticism. The principles which should serve for construction are to be discovered. Allow me to say now, that the communities of men, as they are in the earth, are capable of both liberty and order. My complaint is made only against the received science of civil society, and not a tithe of the objections are yet named. 
                
                
                   
                  "PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF." 
                  THE essential nature of all races and classes of men is so far alike, and the resulting harmony of their interests so complete, that no difference of conditions among them are favorable for any party, except such as relate them in helpful correspondence to each other. All hostilities are mutually destructive. 
                  The laws of chemistry are laws of dead matter, and their work is death. An acid destroys an alkali, and is itself destroyed. Neither of the elements properly survives the conflict. The changes of mere matter are transformations; but in the domain of life, all reciprocal action is for growth and development; its aim is perfection, and the law is harmony. Everywhere in living nature the individuals of a kind are at peace with each other; and as the rank and endowments rise in dignity and excellence, social relations grow, with equal pace, more numerous, intimate, and beneficent. But the principle of liberty enters the system of existence along with vitality, grows with its growth and strengthens with its strength, and disorder and strife become possible in correspondent augmentation. Still, the scheme of life is unity, and its policy is peace; and the law of harmony must be obeyed, or it will be vindicated by its natural penalties-not that vengeance is the end, for the sovereign purpose is not more defeated by rebellion itself than by the punishments which correct it. Hell is a continued insurrection, and annihilation would be utter failure and its completest acknowledgment. Suffering is the corrective of evil, and the discipline of the wrong-doer, that, in the end, good may prevail; or, as St. Paul has it, that God may be all in all, when all things shall be subdued unto Him. 
                   
                  To the working of this grand scheme it is obviously essential that service and sacrifice be rendered by the higher to the lower; that the elder shall serve the younger, the angels minister to the heirs of salvation, and the Divine atone for all. The great law of our life, the righteousness which is of God by faith, in the apostle's apprehension, is that the disciple "may know the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to his death," and "fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ." 
                  This doctrine of human redemption has been rendered vague and mystical by theological speculations; but it is based in nature and necessity, and must be understood before we can have the rule of duty, or guide of policy, for the aims of social benevolence. The idea is, that it is the office of the wise to instruct the ignorant, and of the strong to help the weak; for the fact is, that they can be enlightened and strengthened in no other way. It is this moral necessity that dedicates the good to the service of the evil; that sends the disciples out as sheep among wolves; that compels the surrender of life to the toils of study, to the sacrifices of the battle-field, and at the martyr's stake, and gives us all the forms of heroism which we worship among men. 
                  This being the economy, the policy, of the social system, what are its requirements, and the conditions of its success, in any enterprise of civil or political amendment of the condition of one class of men by the agency of another? If it be the system of domestic slavery, such as exists among us, which is to be remedied, it is clear that to be capable of the work, we must not only feel the wrong and design the relief, but we must know the means and possess or provide the conditions which shall avail in practice for the purpose. 
                  How does the case lie before us? We are politically free as individuals, and independent as a nation.-The slaves are denied every civil and political right of human beings by our laws; they are chattels to their masters, and only sagacious animals to themselves. Are we qualified for their elevation, and are our institutions capable of receiving them into the freedom which we contemplate for them? 
                  Legal emancipation might be effected in several ways. By legislation of the constitutional majorities, enforced by the peaceful powers of Government-by force of arms, employed by the free people of the nation in the compulsion of the masters-by successful servile insurrection-by colonization, and, by other means, or several of these combined. The relation of master and slave could be dissolved by either of these methods; and, if the right of freedom were perfect, and the aim could certainly be well secured, the precedents which the world respects would warrant any of them, and they would be both allowable and obligatory upon the parties who possess the power. But it is felt that there is something in several of these possible plans which forbids their adoption. No sound heart or clear head would consent to civil war, much less to servile insurrection, to effect the object. The reasoning which justifies our own national revolution does not satisfy the conditions of this case. The abstract right is the same, in both white and black men, for, their ultimate destiny is the same, and the highest interests of each demand equally favorable institutions and order. Why, then, do we pause, both in thought and action? 
                  I think the true reason is, that we are not fit, and that our civil and social economy are not adjusted to the necessities of the enterprise. 
                  Our own liberties stand upon the principle that all men are created equal, and our institutions in theory recognize the right of self-government in every human being. We provide for the impracticable exceptions, however, by our laws which exclude infancy and womanhood from participation in the administration of the Government; and we run the risk of incompetency among adult white men, in the confidence that there is safety in the majority. For, after all, it is only a legal fiction that every man is his own governor, and assents to the laws which he must obey. 
                  Our American republicanism is, therefore, much narrower than the sweep of its theoretical maxims, and our institutions in no tolerable measure cover the ground of their basis; and, it is this very point of incompetency for the functions of government which breaks the correspondence. Still we hold by the principle none the less that we refuse its proper force in our forms and facts. 
                  Now, the principle is true. No man can own another man as property, and no man can own anything that belongs to that other man; they are his benefits, and deprivation of the least is an injury and a wrong. But, general propositions need to be carefully examined and fully understood, or they lead to confusion. We say every man has naturally the right of self-government; and our system in fact goes much further-it Empowers every man to govern his neighbor also. In a particular exigency, a single vote may decide the policy of a whole State. Competency for political liberty in our representative system of legislation is, therefore, a matter in which everybody else is concerned, as well as the man who claims the right; and it is not unreasonable to make it a condition of enfranchisement and citizenship. But on the other side-the disfranchised man and woman may plead their natural right of self-government, infringed by the denial. Such rights as these in such conditions, may and do conflict. Where is the mischief that begets this confusion, and dislocates the logic of first principles? 
                   
                  These principles are respectively right, and cannot, therefore, contradict each other. It must be an accident, it must be in the sphere of some falsehood where they meet, that they go thus to war. I can find the error nowhere else than in the constitution of the civil state. If that were true, if it were the true focal point of action for any right principle, it would not embarrass or destroy the force of any other. The primary rights of all men issue fairly out of the abstract truth, but they get entangled in the forms of our organic structure and the facts of our condition. It is not so in the institutions of nature. In the family economy, infancy and incompetency work no forfeiture of rights, and cripple no interests, and sacrifice no benefits, of individuals. Liberty and authority are there well balanced; parental instincts and natural affection promote the highest good of all. The wisdom and strength of the little society supply its ignorance and weakness; the inequality is without oppression, and the Government is in the best hands for the best uses of the whole community. The new-born child and the immature youth are governed so far as they need direction. They are not invested with offices of which they are incapable, but their powers are not crippled; their freedom is conceded to the full measure of their capabilities, and its exercise is encouraged. 
                  Until the institutions of civil society are in like manner adjusted to capacities, and fitted for the protection of the interests of all its members, republics, as heretofore, will serve only for the greatest good, of the greatest number which they can accommodate of the people concerned in organizing them. Government by representation in the higher counsels of State is said to be necessary, on account of the inconvenience of primary assemblies of the people for such purposes; but it has also another effect: it removes the power by many a step in many an indirect path, from the populace; and the majority principle in the election of legislators is nothing else than a plan for ascertaining truth by counting the noses of the opposing parties, however necessary it may be for the purpose of attaining a decision of the questions submitted. 
                  Now, with imperfections such as these which have been presented, and other violations of its fundamental principles which are obviously unavoidable, it is clear enough that our representative democracy is incapable of providing for the rights of all the people, and, at the same time securing the order civil and social, which exists among us. 
                  If we had a perfect order, no man would be any more disposed to hold a slave than to be one. A perfect system would be an adapted one, and of course, under it, no man's ignorance or weakness would be mischievous to any other, because provision would be made for him which would keep him in place, while his best interests would be kept within his reach, and so his own well-being would flow into and swell the tide of the general prosperity. 
                  I am not denying that republicanism is an advance upon monarchy and aristocracy, or that government of all by the many is an improvement upon the one-man power. I reckon, on the contrary, that our liberties are worth all that their purchase and conquest have cost in the past ages. I am only exhibiting the discrepancy between the first principles which we hold, and the forms through which we endeavor to give them effect. The exposure shows the difficulty which there is in according to the disfranchised classes the rights which first principles demand for them. The radical reasoner has no trouble in displaying his doctrine of human rights, and good conscience and highest policy corroborate his creed with their instant endorsement; but the objector who stands upon the incompatibility of universal justice with the existing system, has advantages in his position from which he is not so easily dislodged. 
                  When the emancipationist waives for the present the slave's political rights, and only insists upon his lawful ownership of himself, and his right to the rewards of his own labor, he concedes the alleged incapacity for full citizenship, and damages very materially the force of his argument for the simpler rights demanded. It greatly affects the entireness and beneficence, as well as the policy, of the individual's personal freedom, to strip him of its political safeguards and auxiliaries. This is what is meant by the assertion that the emancipated slave is changed into a nuisance, and crushed into the degradation of an oppressed caste, and held there without hope of change by the repugnance of the higher classes. I apprehend that there is no certain or immediate prospect that the free States will admit their colored inhabitants to the rank and rights of citizenship. If this be so, the objection, to this extent, is supported by the fact, and the incompetency of our institutions for complete emancipation, affected as they are by the public sentiment which controls them, is established. 
                  But our industrial system, or the economy of property and commerce, and the social order which results, confront the proposed personal freedom of the three millions with other incompatibilities, which touch the very substance of our fitness to grant the right and to confer its real blessings along with the form and name of freedom. The Great Teacher said to one of his disciples, "After thou art converted, preach my gospel;" and we must not be surprised when the enemy retorts the advice to the friends of universal freedom. 
                  What, hitherto, have our laws done for the rights of labor, that may authorize us to reproach any form of oppression which touches the life of those who have no other capital? Are they free from the faults which occasion the pauperism of Europe? Are they not essentially a copy of the property feudalism which still survives in the Old World? Nature and the necessities of our condition have made for us all our boasted difference. Imprisonment for debt, and the sweeping desolation of legal executions, are only now beginning to abate their barbarous rule among us. And the natural right of the landless man to his own patrimony in the public domain is still obstinately withheld!! We are still patching up our systematic injustice with alms-house charities, and calling the necessity which this injustice creates Christian beneficence. Our industrial system is still a cut-throat competition between labor and capital, and as much a war of classes as it was when the feudal baron was the task-master, and the hereditary earl was sheriff of the county. Abundance of land and the demand for labor of a pioneer epoch holds the mischief in check, but there is nothing in the nature and spirit of our industrial system which provided the conditions for general and effective emancipation of the enslaved, or fortifies our logic against his master. 
                  John C. Calhoun, about the year 1839, in a speech against the reception of abolition petitions, warned the gentlemen of the North who were then yielding to the enthusiasm of their constituents, that there are other rights of property wholly artificial, and as much the creatures of mere positive law as the slaveholder's, which would come in time under the same condemnation. He alluded to monopolies, private corporations, interest upon money, especially upon the debts of banks, circulated as money in the community, and titles to unlimited quantities of land, with other heirlooms of the old-time despotism, which will be brought to judgment when the principle of natural rights shall get inaugurated in the government of the Union. He thought that the new patch on the old, garment would tear out a large margin in the rotten fabric, under the strain of wearing; and that the abolition gentlemen of property and standing would make the rent a great deal broader than they intended. I think they took the hint, and that the Baltimore platforms are well crammed with its prudence. 
                  The feebleness and fear of our defective system are only too strongly indicated by the stand-still conservatism which our magnates everywhere discover. The white free working man is their real terror. Land reform, non-imprisonment for debt, homestead exemption, limitation of working hours, universal suffrage, education of the people to their highest capacity, and democracy realized in all the interests of private life, are in the threatening programme of reform; and so, the appeal to conscience and absolute right in behalf of the chattel slave is branded as the rebellion of the higher law against social order; and the fraternity of nations, urging the natural sympathy of the republic for the freedom of Europe, is formally denounced in the creeds of the ruling parties. Precedent is resorted to for handcuffs upon progress, and the example of the fathers is paraded to show that mummies are the most stable forms of the human organism, and the very best models for a permanent order. 
                  To say nothing of the likelihood of advancing general liberty just now, what fitness for such work has that people acquired, who have enacted the outrages of the last eight years-the series which began with the admission of Texas, and was rounded up with the Fugitive Slave Law, and sealed with the finality resolutions? Can a system whose elements may be worked into such results easily confer a capricious gratuity upon the victims of its habitual oppression? 
                  I conclude that we are not fit, and that our institutions, in their present form, are not capable of the proposed justice to the slave, and I predict that neither slavery in the States, nor its propagandism by the Federal authority, will sensibly abate till our democratic doctrines get a formal and positive application to the individual and private interests of the industrious classes. The multitude, which is the majority and the material force of our Government, must learn the common rights of humanity, and strike upon the method of asserting them effectually for themselves, before they will lend their power to the emancipation of the slaves or the repression of the system of chattelism in man, and the degradation of labor which domestic slavery involves.

                  ASSOCIATION. 
                  WE have but little acquaintance with the system of social and industrial organization which it proposes, but that little has made such impressions that we cannot doubt the good which will follow from the propagation of its doctrines. We are not of those who reject a theory because some of its most remarkable points seem impracticable, or because it rudely puts us upon the defence of our most cherished opinions. But there is a still stronger reason why we would not hastily reject revolutionary novelties-the feeling which we have in common with everybody else, that the system of things in which we live is not so good that it ought to be blindly defended against all change. Stubborn conservatives ought not to forget that their opposition to all proposed reforms really involves them in responsibility for all the evils which they passively maintain. The people of this generation are terribly worried with revolutions and reforms, but they would not be at peace if philanthropy, real and pretended were to desert the earth to-day. The world is not good enough, nor well enough ordered to ensure comfort and quiet, if all its fanatics were dead. It must be mended, and this felt necessity will ensure every plausible reform a hearing from somebody, and those who accept it will press its claims, whether men will bear or whether they will forbear. 
                  On every side our understanding is challenged to inquire and our hearts are courted to act on the vital interests of humanity. All our institutions, religious, civil and economical, are undergoing the boldest and most earnest investigation. Some minds are occupied with questioning particular points in the established order. Of these there are so many sets, each pressing a special reform or a single idea, that our whole inheritance of usages and opinions, creeds and conventionalisms are attacked in detail; and there are others that with a universal sweep, strike boldly at the entire system of society, and put us at once upon the defence of creed and party, position and property. In the hurly-burly of this general war there are doubtless errors and excesses committed by all parties; as well by conservatists as by the most radical revolutionists. 
                  In the great strife we may, if we will, remain comparatively inactive, but we cannot be indifferent. We do not evade the questions presented, nor escape their effect upon ourselves, by merely declining the open championship of the opinions which we hold. Indeed the refusal to investigate and discuss, only puts us more quietly, but not less positively, into the defence of things as they are, for if I reject all the reforms which solicit my aid, I am supporting the institutions which exist, and the powers that be, as decidedly as if I were doing battle for them in the open field of public controversy. We think there are but few reflecting people who would voluntarily tarily make themselves answerable for the whole sytsem of things as they are. Utopia can't be made so drunk and crazy and wretched as the world we live in, and the prophets and philosophers who propose a new heaven and a new earth meet our wants and necessities so nearly that they ought neither to be mobbed nor scorned. If men could be wise and honest and happy, as we are, they might turn up their noses at all innovation, but they are not now exactly in the circumstances to be saucy to any fool or madman that has a higher hope and a more equitable system. 
                  We have a world to put in order, and why not receive proposals and examine the terms of all the world menders who wish to take the contract? Some of them have excellent suggestions to make, and among them all, a good plan may be found. 
                
                
                  CAPITAL vs. LABOR. 
                  UNDER this head the Pennsylvanian of yesterday quotes a speech delivered by a Mr. Butler at Lowell, upon the threatened or expected reduction of the operatives' wages, accompanied with its own comments upon the speech, and opinions upon the topic. The facts appealed to are matters of the highest concern, and the views advanced as interesting, and true, too, as a partial and partisan investigation can well be. It is to be regretted, however, that the drift of the discussion is so deeply tinged with party politics. Capital is of no particular creed, religion, or party, but has its own instincts, and naturally pursues its own interests. Differences of sentiment modify the character, and within certain limits, affect the conduct of particular capitalists, but the system and its necessities control them in essentials, and level all other distinctions in effecting their classification. Democrats as well as Whigs hold bank stocks and own factories; and the law of their order generally determines their relation to labor, and governs their behavior towards it. The principles of Democracy, indeed, would righteously regulate and harmonize the respective interests of the employer and the workman; but, in fact, the mere profession of these principles does not induce conformity in the capitalists of either party, nor secure the rights of the persons in their employment. 
                  Moreover, money is not voluntarily guilty of all the oppressions which it inflicts, and labor is not wholly innocent of its own wrongs. 
                  The accidental embarrassments which wealth suffers, and its own disturbing antagonisms, take away much of its freedom and moral responsibility; and the ruinous competition among workmen themselves, and their unequal strife with machinery, still further influence their condition, and confuse the question. Just as long as labor must sell itself for wages, in the open market, it must accept the market price, though life, liberty and happiness are thus converted into commodities. 
                  The principle which lies at the bottom of the whole matter is overlooked in all class legislation and partisan reasoning. Justice and humanity plead for the rights of the operative; avarice and order advocate the interests of the employers-both alike maintain the existing war between them; and the result is that the victory always falls to the side of the most powerful. In the language of the good book-"on the side of the oppressor there is power." But, whatever benevolence demands, men cannot be made better on the one side, nor wiser and stronger on the other, than their respective circumstances will allow. 
                   
                  They must be otherwise adjusted to each other before the evil can be remedied. Mutual hostilities cannot result in anything but mutual injuries. They must be harmonized. The capitalist must be made secure of equitable returns-the laborer, of all that he produces, and they must both be interested to do each other justice before they will ever be so disposed. 
                  Labor is the efficient producer of values-wealth is an indispensable instrument. Labor is the creator; wealth is a necessary condition of its productiveness. They must be adjusted-married to each other, that their legitimate fruit may be mutually and rightfully enjoyed. Nothing that is bought and paid for can be free. Labor must be taken into partnership with capital before it can receive the issue of its own energies. The whole system is incoherent and unnatural. 
                  Wealth is the product of labor in its largest meaning; nothing that human labor creates is indestructible-whatever hands produce perishes either in the using or by necessary decay; yet money, the mere representative of industrial products, by the necromancy of legislation, is made immortal. If by any effort or accident I get money enough to maintain myself for twenty years without labor, I can, by lending it at five per cent. interest, make it last unimpaired my lifetime, and the lifetime of one representative heir in each generation through all time to come; and so discharge one man for ever from the necessity of labor, and cast his support upon the industry of others. The things, substances, products of labor, for which it was at first exchanged, all perished, perhaps within the first twenty years of that endless term; but the bonds and stocks endure eternally. The bush in the mount which burned without being consumed was nothing to this. The miracle of perpetual interest est upon capital eclipses it as much as Vesuvius surpasses a farthing candle. 
                  The British debt has been paid, fully paid, again and again. That it never can be paid under the present system of perpetual interest, which leaves the capital undiminished, proves the falseness of the principle-that which is impossible is not according to nature and law. The money of the world is owned by a few. The very gold originally given for the values exchanged has worn out, but the paper and parchment assurances suffer no change, and the labor of the world is taxed to maintain the amount undiminished. But all this is not the fault, the crime, nor the shame of the capitalist; but of the system which enforces his submission and oppresses him, also, in his degree, as sadly as the poorest dependent in his employment. The rich man's gains are as insecure, and he dies in as great apprehension for the well being of his children, as the poorest. The beggar has nothing to leave to his children-the millionaire can only provide for his, by entailing his wealth upon the third generation, and he does not feel safe when he does that. If labor and wealth, hands and purse, were but well reconciled and harmonized, the mutual insurance would protect and bless both with peace and plenty. "Seek first the kingdom of heaven, and all these necessary things shall be added unto you;" contains the philosophy of the divine order, and indicates the only conditions upon which its blessings can be secured. The societary family must be organized, the actual brotherhood of man must be established, if we are ever to be relieved from anxious thought for to-morrow, and delivered from the pressure of want to-day. 
                  The cry of the "poor against the rich," is often translated into the cry of "bread or blood; and the stubborn conservatism of wealth must expect at last to meet its victims at the barricades. We will have no hand in provoking and prosecuting such unnatural war among brethren, and we will preach no gospel to the poor that does not work by love and purify the social system. We would urge reform, because men must choose between that and revolution. Throwing the restraints of the civil law and established order into the current may dam it for awhile, but the accumulated tides will at last break the barrier, to find the channel again, and will then overflow the banks in its desolating rage. Gradual reform or violent revolution is the necessity of our condition. 
                  There are some men who depend upon their crutches for their progress, and hug their chains as their only security. Nothing is so fearful to an essential slave as freedom. They need not tremble at the threatened change. Their system will necessarily last for them as long as they live. The history of humanity might reconcile them to the necessity of change of some kind. The annals of the world's progress are but so many tomb-stones of its departed kingdoms, societies, and systems. We must go forward-we are embarked upon the tide, and if the head reels and the shores recede and sink, it is because we are drifting toward our destiny. Better bravely trim our sails to the breeze, than cowardly to depend upon anchors which cannot hold. 
                
                
                  CAPITAL AND LABOR. 
                  THERE is nothing in the spontaneous action of the social economy to limit the accumulation of wealth in single hands; and municipal law nowhere interposes to say thus far shall individual appropriation go and no further; nor, on the other hand, does the constitution of society or civil law make any provision, other than poor laws and voluntary charities, to prevent absolute destitution. The distribution of wealth is left to unregulated individual competition. The natural tendency, and the actual operation of this system, are to increase all existing inequality of distribution until it ultimates in the very extremes of pauperism and of opulence. All the causes which are primarily concerned in breaking the balance continue to act, and with a force multiplied at every stage by its own effect, so that every new result is an increased departure from proportion and equality. 
                  Capital does not, in nature and fact, reproduce capital, for "money is barren," and all commodities perish in the using. Capital and labor co-operating have the function of reproduction,-separated, they are both alike incapable. In the present order of things they are divorced, or, rather, they are unmarried; they hold no true relation to each other, and their issue is not legitimate. Capital purchases, and by purchasing, dishonors labor, and at the same time corrupts itself. Their union is necessary to their fruitfulness; but labor is denied any natural right in the issue, and accepts wages instead. This is the principle of the mis-alliance, and the degradation corresponds to the wrong. Labor is honorable in union with capital, and its wedlock undefiled; but its prostitution is not relieved by either custom or necessity. The labor that sells itself every day in the market would not be so much flattered if it were really respected. 
                  Under our system of hostile ownership, the soil, materials, and implements are under the dominion of one party and interest, and wherever the system has become considerably matured, the other party is at its mercy, and must accept such conditions as it has to offer. Against political and religious despotisms, revolutions and rebellions are often successful; but against the money power, never. The law of property, established in the world's conscience, and strong in every man's instincts, sanctions the mischief, and protects the abuse, while it supports the right that lies under them. Men cannot do what they know to be wrong in principle and inconsistent also with the tacit agreement of the social organization. The evil is in the system. It is an organized warfare. Man is armed against his fellow man, and life itself depends upon the struggle, and compels it. The laborer exhibits his sufferings and makes his complaints; the capitalist answers by showing his own necessities, and so justifies his monopolizing acquisitions. In impulse and purpose both are right; in method both are wrong, and equally anxious, uncertain and unhappy. 
                  The method only is wrong, for exclusive property and differences of taste and necessities are just and natural. But nature is consistent with herself, and no man's interest is in another man's loss, by her constitution. The parties must be reconciled in action as they really are one in interest. The brotherhood of the race stands translated into partnership in business. Instead of buying and selling, hating and robbing, each other, give each his equitably adjusted benefit in the mutual product of combined means, skill and toil; inaugurate justice, conform the system of life to the truth of things; and we shall have reciprocity of feeling and mutual guarantees out of our harmonized interests, and all the benefits and blessings of a true commonwealth, industrial and social, as well as political, will result. 
                  It may be difficult, but it cannot be impossible, to organize society naturally. In truth, there is nothing so practicable as the right. Human experience proves that all false systems fail; sound philosophy insures the success of the true. To call the hope of better things visionary, is in effect to preach content with the existing falsehood and evil, and virtually to defend and support them. 
                
                
                  THE OLD GRUDGE. 
                  THE war between wealth and poverty cannot be compromised, for there is nothing in the demands of either that the other can afford to grant, and nothing in their respective wants which can be surrendered. Poverty needs all and more than wealth possesses; and gives no pledge that it would use it any better or be any better satisfied than the present holders. Wealth has as hard a fight against prospective as poverty has with present want. Never a millionaire dies but he endeavors to entail his property, that is, encumber it to his immediate heirs for the security of those most remote from him, which the law allows him to provide for. Wealth has terrible fears which compel it constantly to increase, and anxiously to secure, its possessions-poverty has pains which goad it to continual assaults upon the cruel inequality of distribution by which it suffers. 
                  The conflict of these belligerents has not the formal array of the battle-field, for it is not fought across any fixed party line. It is a promiscuous hand-to-hand struggle. Every man strikes the man next him, employing at once all the stratagems which can deceive, and all the force that may crush, his victim, having no other cause of quarrel than the spoils of victory. There can be no end of a war which gives no combination to the combatants, and makes every conquest a cause of strife among the victors. It is a free promiscuous fight in which every man's hand is against every other man, and every other man's hand against him. 
                   
                  The picture cannot be overdrawn. "The battle of life!" It has become a proverb; and men have submitted to it as to a necessity. They have even digested it into a philosophy and given it a shelter in their religion. Either as penance and atonement, or as discipline and means of growth, the sufferings, privations and disabilities of the strife are commended to the acceptance of men. 
                  A false philosophy teaches us to ascribe our virtues to our wants, our achievements to our necessities, and quotes history and distorts logic, to prove the paradox. Such doctrine, if it proves anything, proves the Millenium an impossibility, and reduces heaven to a dream. According to it, some kind or degree of hell is an essential condition of human existence. While it insists upon the growth of change from evil to good, it denies that from good to better, and from less to more. 
                  Whence came the idea that activity must be extorted by suffering? not in the music saloon, the picture gallery, the ball room, the library, the social circle, the church, nor from any place or thing we call a joy.-The slaveries and curses of life are so much in the foreground that they hide its blessings and beauties from observation. 
                  Men must be reconciled with each other, and with nature, or they cannot be in harmony with their Creator and their destiny. Society must be reorganized-conflict must give place to confidence, strife to unity, and competition must be swallowed up in brotherhood. It is sin to preach submission until there is peace. 
                
                
                   
                  INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION. 
                  FREE industrial competition is, in principle, a system of masked fratricide. What it calls a fair chance is the dance of a rough-shod donkey among chickens, with a free fling of his heels at the crippled and haltered nags that occupy the adjoining stalls. That liberty which dissolves society into separate individualism, and turns everybody into the mle of a deadly antagonism is, in effect, the political system of the savage state mixed with the social and industrial economy of civilization. Landlordism and monopoly of wealth, severed from the old feudal ownership of the laborer, in the end converts those who were once serfs, through the process of emancipation and wages slavery, into public paupers,: but not until the free toilers have first converted the wilderness into a garden, and covered the land with palaces, and delivered its mines into the hands of its masters, and then they get leave to perish in their poverty. 
                  So for as the tendency of the system goes, it is a refinement in cruelty for wealth to claim credit for emancipating the body and bones of a man while it keeps its clutches tight upon all the labor they can yield, and at the same time keeps itself discumbered of the carcass. He that buys the use of a man, buys the man himself and should take care of him-accordingly, a poorhouse support is felt to be the fag end of the wages bargain between wealth and labor. 
                
                
                  CLUB HOUSES. 
                  CLUB Houses and Unitary Buildings for united families are being considered and will doubtless soon come into fashion. If they were confined to the use of people in moderate or in merely independent circumstances, the argument for them would be irresistible. At present nothing short of an immense fortune can secure all desirable conveniences, and afford all necessary defences to the separate household. In our cities, among the poorer of our respectable buildings, the very same cooking and slopping are carried on in all the adjoining rooms throughout a whole court, row, alley, or street. The common walls are thinner than good partitions ought to be; and if a child cries in its bed, half a dozen neighboring households must lie awake to listen to it. The front door is in the street, and the back door opens upon the nuisances of the whole range; cleanliness and privacy are impossible, and the proportion of expense borne by each establishment over what it would be in well regulated associations, is the difference between hiring a sorry cab for fifty cents and riding in a handsome omnibus for sixpence. 
                  Society still retains so much of the savage spirit of isolation that families will slink into a cell or kennel in dismal distrust and defiance, rather than club their means, and live together in palaces, the way the households of princes do. 
                  The unitary building, by putting whole families on the same floor, covering in the common stairway, and supplying heat and light, and cooking and washing, on the principles of a partnership, would secure all the economies of large capital well managed for the benefit of the smallest stockholder. It would spare to every family the necessity of at least one servant; it would easily provide a library and reading-room out of the joint stock in books and papers of the whole establishment; it could keep open an agreeable resort for the leisure hours of all the inmates, and supply the instructive method of neighbourly intimacy. The rate of rent would be regulated by the level of the floor occupied, so that a fifth story would be as cheap as a hut two miles up town, and be at the same time so contrived that the family need never descend except when in other circumstances they wished to go down street. 
                  But we cannot pretend to enumerate all the benefits of the scheme, and we see none of its inconveniences. The unitary building must not be judged by any supposed resemblance to one of our horrid barracks of dwelling-houses, crowded with ten or a dozen families tumbled in as if they had been dumped down out of a cart into the rooms. We are speaking of a palace cheap enough for the poor, and grand enough for the rich, because large enough for a variety of both. 
                
                
                  PROTECTIVE UNIONS-GUARANTEEISM. 
                  THESE associative movements are attracting general attention, and are in several places in successful operation. Very recently we have one started in this city, which numbered one hundred and ten persons within a fortnight of its first effort. 
                  The objects are generally stated to be protection and co-operation in the prosecution of such branches of mechanical and mercantile pursuits as may be found necessary and expedient for the mutual benefit of the membership. Provision for the relief of sick and disabled members and the defraying of funeral expenses, is also made. 
                  The economy of the association is somewhat complex, as it must be (however well devised), to embrace and arrange all the functions which it is to fulfill. 
                  An initiation fee is required, for the purpose of securing a capital for the business of the society. 
                   
                  The candidate for membership must be at least twenty-one years of age, "and of a moral character," and is admitted to membership by an unanimous vote. 
                  Members are to have stated and proportioned benefits of the association in sickness, &c., on their farther compliance with certain terms and conditions, and making certain stated contributions to the fund provided for that purpose. 
                  A contingent fund also is raised by a tax of five cents a month upon all the members, to be applied in charitable relief of sickness and misfortune of the membership. 
                  The business of the society will embrace the purchase and sale of such commodities, goods, wares and merchandise, as are required by the ordinary necessities of life, i.e. it will keep a store where the products of its members' industry will be taken at the ordinary market prices, and sold again at the usual profit. The capital will be invested in the variety necessary to such general trade. The members are required to sustain the Union by the patronage of such employments and business as it may he engaged in. 
                  No portion of the funds or property of the Union shall be loaned. All operations of the Union shall be for cash. Each member shall have the privilege of purchasing for the use of himself and family and shall be allowed upon his purchases five per cent., which he may withdraw at the end of the year. Members may purchase at wholesale, and the discount shall then be made at the time of the purchase. The branches of trade prosecuted by the Union shall be determined by the Union in session. Traffic in intoxicating liquors and tobacco, excluded. At the expiration of five years that portion of the profits which may have accumulate upon sales to the public, and the property on hands, will be divided among the members, in the ratio of their respective purchases. 
                   
                  This is a hasty, very hasty, and imperfect account of the organization, obtained by a glance at the Constitution, without leisure for examination, or explanations, from those who are most interested in, and best acquainted with it. 
                  The main object is to effect the exchange and purchase of necessaries, and save to the consumer the profits usually paid to the exchanger, in the form of 5 per cent. on the amount purchased at the end of the year, and an equitable dividend of the resulting profits at the end of five years. Incidental advantages will be derived by the management of the concern to the mechanic who may find steady employment and fair wages for his work from the Union. The "beneficial" feature added, makes it a health assurance also, and the contingent fund is a provision of benevolence. 
                  It is difficult to reason from first principles upon schemes which are not broad enough for all the purposes of society, and yet are so far complicated as to embrace a considerable number of its functions and interests. The general policy of guaranteeism has demonstrated its efficiency in a great number of single interests; but those enterprises which include productive industry and exchanges together, are as yet matters of experiment; and integral association, which first principles alone would safely and certainly direct, has never been fairly attempted. Communism has had repeated trials, and frequently attained and enjoyed such success as it aimed at for considerable periods, but it never was self-sustained, and it never can sustain itself. The coarsest and lowest necessities of life may be secured on the lowest level of our common nature, but provision for the development of the whole man and the growth of the race, must respect the individualism that corresponds to the natural differences of men. 
                  We are not offering any opinion or venturing any prediction tion upon the principles and prospects of Protective Unions. It would be rash as unavailing to do so. Every thing new must be learned, which is as true for the experimenter as for the thinker. 
                  If there were or could be enough people engaged to supply the whole variety of uses on which we all depend for our daily wants; and if the exchanges of service, and products of skill, capital and industry, were effected so as to prevent speculation and antagonism of the money power, we could answer in a word for the success of the scheme. But to a partial and incomplete one, there attaches the difficulty of guarding it against the power of all that is necessary to it but not within its control, nor linked into its harmonies. This, however, is only a difficulty, and there is wisdom and virtue enough somewhere to meet it. 
                  The world is busy all around us in the preparatory studies and experiments of which this is an example. Guaranteeism is the marked character of the era. Odd Fellows, Sons of Temperance, Beneficial Societies, and other voluntary associations with practical ends in view, under a hundred names and forms, and embracing, perhaps, a million of our countrymen, indicate the transition from hostile and indifferent individualism to the societary organization which the nature and necessities of man demands and predicts. 
                  People are beginning to understand that it is association which builds magnificent churches for the parish which cannot afford a single fine dwelling-house for any one of its members-that by accidental association of the community a man can ride twenty miles an hour in a floating palace for a shilling-that by the contribution of a trifling sum, security against want in sickness can be had, or a little fortune laid up for the family, bereaved of its support by death; and men, however slow to understand their own experiences and learn their largest applications, will at last employ them for the most beneficent, and the grandest purposes-just as the long neglected power of steam has been elaborated into omnipotence, and the simple phenomena of galvanism are made to answer the purposes of omnipresence. 
                  It was necessary-it is orderly-that the physical triumph should be first achieved, and then the social becomes possible, obvious and necessary. From the isolated savage to the associated man there lies a long infancy of error, suffering and resulting education. The world has some hard lessons to learn yet, but it is very busy just now with its studies, and will at last reach the Q. E. D. of the great problem of human existence. 
                  
                     1848.
                   
                
                
                  THE PROGRESS OF THE AGE, 
                  in its material aspect, as well as in its intellectual and moral, rightly interpreted, means association, neighborhood, brotherhood, unity-DISTANCE is the enemy to be overcome. 
                  The American Railway Guide reports that on the 1st of January, 1853, there were in the United States, 13,227 miles of completed railroad; 12,928 miles of railroad in progress of construction; and about 7,000 miles under survey, which will be built within the next three or four years-making a total of 33,155 miles; which at the average cost of $30,000 (a well ascertained average) for each mile, including equipments, etc., will have consumed a capital of $994,650,000; in round numbers, one thousand millions of dollars. 
                  Add to this the canals and navigable streams in the nation, and the telegraph lines, of which we had 16,729 miles in December, 1852, and the post-routes traversed in the year to the extent of fifty-nine millions of miles, and we have some idea of the apparatus provided for the intercourse of the people of the Republic. Twenty-five millions of people have invested at least fifteen hundred millions in the ways, and perhaps five hundred millions more in the means or vehicles, of inter-communication-eighty dollars a head invested by the people in the routes of travel and transportation (railroads, canals, turnpikes, plank roads, and river improvements). One hundred millions is the interest of two billions, at five per cent.; and if the stock is worth par in the average, one hundred millions is the expense of travel and transportation to the good people of the Union. Nine millions more is the cost of the General Post Office, and four dollars and a half is the apportioned expense of each individual, for all the advantages of intercourse in all these ways secured to us. One hundred and ten millions per annum, the aggregate cost of our war with space. 
                  By some of these routes, Time is almost annihilated; by others, he compromises for about five hundred miles a day; while on others, he still holds us at the old jog trot inconvenience. But materialism is everywhere giving way, and the sovereignty of mind is rapidly getting itself absolutely established. The hostile forces of geography hold but little against us, except its mountain fortifications; but ere long it will be driven from these, also, and have no real resting-place but in the atlas. It will always make a show in maps, but in the fact it will amount to nothing. 
                  Time and space are nothing to disembodied spirits. When we have disembodied them, our own bodies will be less troublesome, and much more convenient for our use. Bishop Berkeley denied the existence of matter; but even those who, by his philosophy were able to overcome their prejudices dices, were none the better able to get over the distances which it interposed. The German metaphysicians think that time and space are mere forms of the understanding. Well, no matter about the logic that undertook so to dispose of the matter; we are hopefully busy working out the fact, which will answer our purposes something better. 
                
                
                  CALIFORNIA GOLD FEVER-LUXURY-ASSOCIATION. 
                  THERE are at least twenty vessels at New York, getting ready to sail for California. New Orleans is as much excited and as active in the enterprise, and the same may be said of every city and perhaps every village in the country, each in its degree. It is plain enough that the business of colonizing will go bravely on, and the gold country will be crowded with adventurers as quickly as travel and transportation can possibly effect it. Will the workers of those mines, and the laborers who furnish their supplies, permit themselves to be under-worked by slaves? Will not the colorophobia of the adventurers, itself, begin to work for the cause of freedom? And will not the emigrants carry with them enough of sense and principle to take care of themselves in this respect? It seems to us that there is a clear streak of light breaking out on the coast of the Pacific. What a glorious recognition of the right it will prove, if all our acquisitions in Mexico turn out at last as so much advancement of truth and freedom. 
                  The gold and silver of the whole earth, emptied out into our lap at once, need not work to our injury. Give us free men-free principles-justice, honesty, and equalitygive us a tolerable approach to human brotherhood, and the luxuries of the East and the wealth of the West will do no harm. The upward tending soul of man will know how to find the hidden blessing that there is in abundance. Gold is a good metal, and it will be all the more useful as it grows more abundant. Real freedom need fear no evil in the free abundance of anything the Creator has made. God has not hidden away in the bosom of the generous earth any stores of essential evil for the destruction of the human race. The fruits of its bosom, for whose abundance we annually send up our thanksgivings, are as liable to conversion into instruments of destruction, as are the minerals beneath its surface. The love of gain in merchandise is just as corrupting as the rage of gold digging-and scarcely as generous. Evils are not things, but abuses; and the religion that is limited to charity for man, without any faith in him or hope for him, is essentially defective. It is just as dangerous to set a slave legally free as it is for a white man to come of age and assume the government of his own life. It is as dangerous to live in a city as it is to own a gold mine. Freedom in every degree, and of every kind, is full of danger, but slavery of every degree and kind is death. Sin is bondage, and bondage is sin. Liberty only is life. 
                  Luxury is abused indeed, but never more so than when it is evil spoken of, and never so much misunderstood us when it is feared. Why, health is luxury. Ease and happiness are internal luxury, and depend upon that which is external. And poverty, with all its pains, is an essential curse, however it may be subdued or controlled for good, and however its direct results are evaded and avoided. Ireland is starving poor; is that a blessing? The majority of men must labor with their hands during all their waking hours to keep the animal alive; is that a blessing? And nearly everybody is a slave for the means of subsistence, and dies in terror of his children's destitution; is that a blessing? Is it shocking to see whole communities crazed with the greed of gold? then turn to the sober, settled insanity of our plodding business marts, and see how general the appetite, and learn how strong the necessity; and learn, also, to recognize in all these forms of the feeling, a natural impulse. Examine its laws, its tendencies, and adjust the order of society to it; for it can be balanced and made at once beautiful, beneficent and harmonious. 
                  Special, extraordinary and extravagant manifestations of the desire for wealth, excite attention, and its misfortunes are recorded against it and reasoned from and feared as if these exhibitions were the evil of money loving and money getting. This is a view at once partial and false. The avarice that spreads itself over a whole life is not so favorably distinguished from that which explodes upon a particular enterprise. Nor is either the one or the other just such an unmitigated sin as moralists imagine. The world's crime is not in its necessities or in their activity; and opinion will make nothing by rebuking the pursuit of wealth, until the order and institutions of society enable the world to obey the injunction, "take no thought for to-morrow, what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink, and wherewithal ye may be clothed." Except within the institutions of the true church and under the shelter of its economy, this is completely impossible. 
                  Organize the Church of Christ first, then preach its principles and policy to the world from the practical position which makes its laws practicable. The man who loves his wife and children must take thought for their to-morrow. But give us institutions which shall relieve the fear and supply the want-give us the brotherhood of the race-give us its family arrangements, its mutual dependencies, harmonized by its mutual interests; let all its wants be supplied by that which each member ministers to the whole, and in that integral, natural and necessary order, the impulse to acquire will be kindly, social, holy, as the industry of the human mother or the mother bird to supply her young. It is not the love of wealth but the strife of wealth-the battle kept up by hostile individualism of property, which wastes the bounties of heaven and perverts them, both in pursuit and possession, into a curse. 
                  In the meantime we ought to deal kindly with the crimes and follies which we virtually compel. 
                  It is reported that those rough, greedy men, who are digging and gathering gold in California, do not rob each other or quarrel over their gains. They have abundance within their easy reach; they leave their uncounted and unmeasured ore in their huts, undefended, day and night, and no one takes it. The natural sense of right, relieved from the pressure of necessity, and from the feeling of inequitable distribution, is enough to guard the treasures honestly acquired, without the aid of law, society, or the presence of womanhood, and the refining conditions which we have in more orderly communities. The men are free-utterly free-the gold is free, and each man's acquisitions are measured by his industry and strength; and natural conscience rules with its natural force and justice, because its decisions are unembarrassed by artificial rules. 
                  Even among such men, in such circumstances, all the interests and all the functions employed in that mean and partial association are marked with justice and harmony. But let some lordling bring in his bond slaves to work for him, and we will not answer for what is called the peace of society and the rights of property-nor for the lives of the innocent victims of oppression, either. They, like established societies, may expend their vengeance upon the wretches whom others compel to inflict their wrongs. 
                  Oh, how much there is in that prayer, "thy kingdom come; thy will be done on EARTH." If our metaphysical religion were but fully translated into actual facts, and put into practicable forms, we would have, every day, our daily bread, without fighting or begging for it. 
                  
                     January, 1848.
                   
                
                
                  REDEMPTION. 
                   
                     
                         
                           Our brother's crimes are our diseases- 
                           His sufferings are our sin. 
                        
                      
                   
                  IN the local item column of our newspapers we have an almost daily report of casualties and crimes, which bitterly reproach the social organization in which they can occur. Thefts and suicides by men, compelled by want,-profligacy and self-destruction of women, to escape the evils which they can no longer sustain! All the offences committed against self and society are not chargeable to the mere wantonness of the will. The world's wealth is not equitably distributed by the system of property and the constitution of society. In Europe there are millions who are, of necessity, trespassers upon every foot of appropriated soil, and nuisances in the highway! We have essentially the same industrial and property institutions. The difference in our political economy, and the vast difference in the quantity and price of land, make all the distinction which we can rightfully claim. The helpless poor in our cities, who cannot avail themselves of these advantages, are in the same pauperism that curses Europe. 
                   
                  Alms-giving is the remedy relied upon there, and the same form of benevolence is the remedy here. In neither is it adequate. It is unavoidable, indeed, and as suitable as patching an outworn garment is, until it can be replaced by a better one. Misery, present and pressing, must be relieved, though the means only aggravate the mischief. 
                  If the Kingdom of Heaven, which the gospel promises, could any way be established upon earth, all these necessary things, for which so many toil all their lives, and so many perish for the want of, would be happily provided for all. The Creator and the material creation are not in fault. The heavens and the earth are genial and generous; but human society is a terrible failure. Its order and economy are essentially vicious. Living costs everybody too much; some, more than they can pay. The three learned professions, embracing a large share of the learning and talent of the community, and all the time at work cobbling and tinkering the sins and sufferings of society, without much success. Governments are quite as busy trying to hold the incoherent mischiefs of the social and political systems in merely tolerable order. Nations consider each other natural enemies. Chris tendom at large disowns the brotherhood of the race; and the average of religious conscience is not above the municipal law. So, we have faith without works, and religion and morality are practically divorced. Scarcely anything of all that heaven and earth tenders for our use answers its purposes except sleep; millions are denied the blessings of that, and to nearly all, the excellent uses of life are postponed till after death. 
                  Fortunate people secure the means of good at a sad expense to the unfortunate, whether they know and intend it or not-like the rank grass that grows upon graves, the rich riot upon the wretchedness that rots beneath them. Bad people find gratification in such luck as this, strive for it and glory in it. Good people cull some happiness out of their cares, while suffering for the present, and laboring and praying for the "better time coming." But the average of human history is a mournful story, punctuated all along with tombstones, and embellished only with the monuments; of those who have died to atone for the sins of the world. 
                  These deaths, however, mean something that more than compensates for the melancholy which they awaken. The Cross of the Sacrificed is the mystic symbol of the world's eventual redemption. Every martyr ascends to the Father to receive good gifts for men; every life loyally devoted and generously offered up, swells the treasures laid up in heaven for the world. The children of the slayers become the heirs of the slain. The victims which their fathers slew become sacrifices to them: the slaughters of each generation are the sacraments of its successor, till humanity shall be regenerated in the blood of its own innocents, the wide earth become one great altar, and the promised new heaven and new earth are established in consummated righteousness. 
                  This must be the divine philosophy of that Providence which sends its chosen ones out into the world like sheep among wolves, and makes its angels servants unto the heirs of salvation. The world must work out its own redemption through the divinity of labor and the sacredness of suffering. "This cup may not pass" till "it is finished," but the last expiatory cry of suffering love that darkens the heavens and shakes the earth, will herald in the resurrection and the life, and the long procession of cross-bearing disciples who have followed Him in the regeneration, shall end in the millenial triumph. 
                
                
                   
                  BENEVOLENCE-SIN AND SUFFERING-CIRCUMSTANCES. 
                  AT a meeting held in the Commissioner's Hall, on the 27th inst., resolutions were adopted, and a society organized for the establishment of a Dispensary in the District. Mr. William J. Mullen was elected President for the ensuing year. Dr. James Bryan and Dr. Matthew F. Groves, Vice Presidents. Henry S. Godshall, Secretary. Samuel M'Menomy, Treasurer, and thirteen gentlemen of the District, Managers. 
                  From the resolutions published and from other sources, we learn that during the prevalence of the ship-fever last year, eight hundred persons were sent to the alms-house from that District, and that the District expenses incurred for burying the dead amounted to six hundred dollars a month. 
                  It is said that the first case of cholera in the city (1832) occurred in Moyamensing, and that it has been a generator of typhus-fever, and other contagious and infectious diseases, for years. The poverty, wretchedness and impurity of some portion of that region get expressive manifestation in its pestilences. The causes are daguerreotyped in the symptoms of the resulting diseases. Ship fever is the rude rhetoric of Baker street wretchedness, the very echo, the ideal, of its sin and suffering. 
                  The infected region lies but half a dozen squares from the State House, and although the veriest extremes of human life lie within so easy a distance, not one in a thousand of our citizens has ever seen the utter destitution and beastly degradation which infest that horrible place. Its cellars, garrets and hovels, defy all description. Our first view of it brought to mind the reply of Mr. Dickens to a gentleman in Pittsburgh, when he was asked if he had not overdrawn the horrors of low life in London. "Overdrawn, overdrawn!" said he, "human language is not adequate to a just description." 
                  Everybody ought to see everything once in their lifetime. Go down there on Sunday afternoon, when the sun is shining, just at the moment when people are coming out of church, thread your way through the well-dressed crowds upon the pavements on your way, turn into St. Mary's, find the narrowest avenue and take it; somewhere near you will meet Mr. Mullen, and he will help you to a view of human life in its lees. Make your observations and take your notes. You need not fear that you will be solicited for pennies or have your pockets picked. Your presence will scarcely be felt, and you will suffer nothing from rudeness. Life is too languid there to be insolent, and hope and desire too feeble to be importunate. Return again some dismal December evening in the twilight, dive into the cellars, climb into the garrets-take it coolly. It is not the place for emotion. Observe, treat the whole matter as a fact. When you go home think it all over. Examine it as a problem, and do your duty afterwards. You need not carry a sixpence along with you. Your donations will make but little difference upon the destiny of those people. 
                  The House of Industry last winter demonstrated that the worst of them could support themselves by sewing carpet rags when they got the whole profit of their own work. The women there who have not clothes enough to keep them warm, or food enough for one satisfactory meal a day, and have not skill of fingers enough to hem a kitchen towel well, can be maintained the whole winter at an expense of about a dollar apiece. Pay their room rent, buy rags for them, and give them only the profit of their work, and they will make from fifteen to thirty cents a day, and live well on it, If the profit on the provisions which they must buy in penny worths could be saved to them, they would get rich. 
                  We are not now suggesting a costly edifice, and a grand system of management, with the forms of pauperism pursued in the whole economy of the institution. A big warm room, and plenty of coarse work, all arranged on business principles, with an efficient agent, and no domineering and no parade-no begging, no anniversaries, no lecturing, and, above all, no benevolence and no show of it. Put fifty of those people on such a footing, and not one of them will dare to receive a gratuity from anybody. Do you believe this? If you doubt, you have no vocation for the alleys and gutters of a metropolis. 
                  Something more than a year ago there were three hundred grog shops in the first ward of the District of Moyamensing. In these rum was sold by the cent's worth, and lottery policies as low as three cents a share!! But these were not the causes of wretchedness that abounded there; they were the consequences-just as drinking and gambling in high life are the consequences of its particular kinds of want and destitution. A man can't die because he has nothing to do worth living for. If his best faculties are dead or suppressed, his lower life must come out the stronger, Death and hell-inactivity and perversion-go together. 
                  One of the companions of our childhood, a noble natured fellow, with the frame and energies of a giant, and the character of a gentleman brought up in the woods, became a drunkard in contempt of the meagreness of actual life. We left him one day drunk, playing the ruffian at a sign-post in our native village. Seven years afterwards we found him in exactly the same place and circumstances. There he stood, in the undilapidated strength of his manhood, with a certain wholesomeness of look, and grandeur of physical proportions, which neither time nor intemperance could destroy. We accosted him bluntly with-"Why, Alick! have you been drunk ever since we parted seven years ago?" He roused himself, cleared his broad brow of its matted locks, looked steadily into our eyes, and answered soberly and meaningly-"No, William, I got sober once, to see how things looked; and when I discovered that the rule of life is ROOT HOG OR DIE, I got drunk again in disgust." 
                  The root of the matter is not reached when we are told that sin is the cause of suffering. What is the cause of sin?-not its remote metaphysical cause, but its immediate circumstantial cause. There is the place for us to meet it. The morality of the best of us owes much to our surroundings. The unspiritual omnipotence of circumstances is an overmatch for the spiritual influence of opinions, in the majority of men. The laws, of Heaven cannot be obeyed anywhere but in the Kingdom of Heaven-within its organization and economy-in its circumstances. Women have eaten their own children in the famine of besieged cities. Drowning men will fight like demons for a plank that promises to float them ashore, and the hopeless will seek refuge? from despair in the temporary insensibility of drunkenness. It is meat, drink and lodging to those that have no other-or, it is blessed forgetfulness. 
                  Let us look into it bravely. It is not restraints, prospective penalties-repression, that regulates the life. Every faculty of humanity is given in reference and adaptation to its object. Attraction leads out our actions. Desires, affections-our loves-constitute our real LIFE; restraints are only negatives-so many nothings. Abraham abandoned his native country on the promise of a better one; he offered up his only son in the certainty that he should receive him again. It is for the joy set before him that any man endures his cross and despises its shame! Human nature, as long as a spark of it remains, will respond to its appropriate stimulus; it will not resist the full play of its natural affinities. 
                  Prayer in the closet-tears at your own comfortable fireside; but, in the highways, in the lanes and alleys, work, work for the sinning and the suffering. Preach repentance if you will, but in Heaven's name plant a ladder in it on which the wretch can climb out of the slough of despondency. 
                  
                     1848.
                   
                
                
                  POOR-LAWS. 
                  THE present system of English Poor-Laws dates as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, A. D.1600. The rates, as the poor-taxes are called, amounted, in 1600, to 190,000; in 1700, to 820,000; in 1800, to four millions of pounds; in 1815, five millions and a half; in 1820 to above seven millions, and 1830 above eight millions; in 1835 to six and a quarter millions; in 1840 and 1845 they stood at five and a half millions per annum. 
                  Wealth is badly distributed in a nation where so large a share of it must go back by force of necessity to the poor every year. There is nothing worse than poor-laws except the laws which make men poor. Indeed it would be hard on principle to show why only enough of the surplus wealth of a nation should be redistributed to keep the wretched barely alive. 
                  There is no foundation in right-it does not belong to the system of truth and justice, to force one man to support another, either by poor-laws or other laws. If the rich have one dollar lawfully which they may not keep rightfully, let who will live or die, they hold it by wrong, not by right. Poor-laws are a bad cobble of a bad system. They are not just, but it is injustice that has made them necessary, and they are a confession of it, if rightly viewed. Property is a natural institution, but the laws of property rest, both in theory and fact, upon the policy of barbarism.-See Blackstone for the one, and the landed aristocracy of England for the other. 
                
                
                  HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION. 
                  THE exemption of the homestead from compulsory sale for the payment of debt, though one of the principles of a new party in this country, is not a new policy in the history of landed property. 
                  Under the common law of England, real estate could not be sold or conveyed by the owner, nor could he subject his land to the payment of his debts, nor in any manner treat it as capital, or make it the basis of credit in business. Not even the consent of the lord from whom the land was immediately held, could enable the owner of a freehold to convey his estate to another, unless he first obtained the consent of his own next apparent or presumptive heir. The policy of these restrictions arose out of the feudal connection between the lord and the landholder, and was designed to preserve it; but it also comprehended and provided for the interests of the heir, with some reference, doubtless, to his rights and necessities. The owner was also, for the same reasons, incapable of devising his real estate by will to another family, or even of altering the course of its descent in his own, by imposing particular limitations. Alienation was in theory impossible, because the grant was made on condition of personal services and fealty, which he could not at will devolve upon another; and the heirs of the tenant in fee, always named in the grant, were held to be beneficially interested in it, and could not, therefore, be dispossessed without their consent. 
                  By degrees these restraints wore off. Trade and commerce, growing with civilization, required increased capital, and property in land was gradually converted into a marketable commodity, and estates were unfettered to answer the enlarging exchanges. 
                  By a statute of Edward the First (A. D. 1292), all persons were enabled to make voluntary sales and conveyances of their freehold estates. But it was not until the time of Charles the Second (about 1670), that devising lands by will was allowed. 
                  Under the common law, the creditor could have satisfaction of his debt only out of the goods and chattels of the debtor, and the present income of his lands; but could not take possession of the lands themselves. The statute of Edward the First, five years earlier than that which allowed the sale of land by the owner without restriction, gave the writ of elegit to the judgment creditor, by which the defendant's goods and chattels were seized, and after being appraised, were delivered to the plaintiff at the price fixed, in satisfaction of his debt or claim. If the goods were not sufficient to discharge the debt, one-half of his freehold lands were also delivered to the plaintiff to be held till out of the rents, issues and profits the debt should be fully paid. By another law, made the same year, persons engaged in trade might pawn the whole of their lands until in like manner the debt was satisfied. This pledge is called statute merchant, and is of the nature of a judgment entered before the mayor of London or some chief magistrate of a city. Afterwards, a similar recognizance, with similar effects, was directed to be registered before the mayors of certain trading towns; but these were permitted only among traders, for the benefit of commerce. 
                  In pursuance of the same policy, and limited to the same class of persons by the several statutes of bankruptcy, the whole of the bankrupt's lands are now subject to be sold for the benefit of creditors. 
                  Tenderness towards the heirs of real property, and regard for the family home, appear very distinctly in the charter of liberties granted by William Penn to the Freemen of the Province of Pennsylvania, dated 1682, and commonly called "Laws agreed upon in England." By these laws it was provided "that all lands and goods shall be liable to pay debts except where there is legal issue, and then all the goods, and one-third of the land only." By an early act of the General Assembly, this liability was extended, providing "that all lands and goods shall be liable to pay debts, except where they shall be legal issue, and then all the goods, and one-half the land only, in case the land was bought before the debts were contracted." In 1688 the Legislature of the Province enacted "that all lands whatsoever, and houses, shall be liable to sale upon judgment and execution against the defendant, heirs, executors and administrators." But in 1705 it was provided "that lands which within seven years may yield yearly rents or profits beyond all reprises, sufficient to pay the debt, interest and costs of suit, shall not be sold, but be delivered to the creditor at the appraised value, until his claim shall be satisfied in the same manner as lands are delivered upon writs of elegit in England. This law is now in force in Pennsylvania, modified as to the method, but not affected in principle. 
                  In nearly all the States of the Union, some reluctance and delay is shown in respect for title in landed estate. One very general restriction of the creditor's right of execution is imposed, by forbidding him to resort to the land until the personal property of the debtor is first exhausted and found insufficient. In several of the States the debtor may redeem his land within a year after its sale under execution, by refunding the purchase money with interest. In some of them it cannot be sold unless it brings two-thirds of its appraised value, and in all, except four or five of them, there are some checks upon the sweeping desolation of a writ of execution. 
                  The old Hebrew rule which declared, "the land shall not be sold for ever," seems grounded on a principle worthy of the authority which Moses claimed for it. It allowed the owner to transfer the possession and sell the produce and profits of his land until the jubilee, but secured to him the right to redeem it sooner if he became able and willing. His own and his family's property in the soil could not be absolutely alienated. Law and religion combined to give sacredness a title at once necessary to happiness, independence and life. This divinely equitable and beneficent policy checked and limited the hungry mammonism of speculation, and long preserved the nation from the destructive inequality and desperate degradation of the mass, which an unlimited traffic in land alone can produce. 
                  To this periodical restitution of each parcel of land to its former owner, there belonged none of the evils which attached to the modern entailed estates at common law. In England no limit was set by the law to the extent of a man's acquisitions tions; and entails, by preserving within the family for ever all the lands which in a succession of ages could, by the various luck of many generations, be acquired, and guarding the constantly augmenting domain from all possibility of diminution or distributions, tended only to aggravate the evils of land monopoly for the few, and land destitution for the many. The Hebrew system, by preserving every man's portion of the earth for ever for himself and his heirs, maintained equality. 
                  The law of Entails acting upon unlimited acquisitions, although in principle every way consistent with the doctrine of absolute dominion over the soil, and the right to appropriate it in perpetuity, threatened consequences so intolerable, that the courts were obliged to interpose, and by a species of judicial legislation, break up the perpetuity of Entails, which the House of Lords prevented the Commons from doing by direct enactment. If Parliament had made the change, the juster medium would have been chosen, no doubt, and the homestead would have been exempted, while the excess would have been left to distribution by the accidents of fortune and the laws of descent. 
                  The National Reformers do well to guard their policy of exempting land from execution by limiting it to the homestead; and they prefer their scheme by ascertaining and determining the quantity which any individual may acquire and hold under these conditions. Their plan, as we understand it, does not propose to disturb vested titles, or to question rights created by existing laws, but leaves the required equalization of landed property to the accidents of trade, and that distribution which follows the death of the present holder. 
                  In this country, the next generation would witness a general correction of all injurious inequalities, and the system of the reformers would prevent any recurrence of the evil by limiting the quantity that might be thereafter acquired. 
                  To us this seems all well devised, prudently guarded, not difficult of adjustment to things as they are, and founded also upon the principles of justice and enlightened policy. 
                  The subtraction of the market value of the soil from the commercial capital of the country, would not, in any degree, or to any effect, diminish the actual wealth of the community. The land would yield its fruits as before, and the real money and conventional credit would still perform their wonted functions, and would easily adapt themselves, without convulsion or violence, to the remaining values in exchange. 
                  Debt has long been treated as a crime of one of the parties to the offence, and punished in him with loss of land and goods, and forfeiture of personal liberty, with all the consequent suffering to his dependencies. This barbarism is passing away. It was not based upon any principle of trade, and could not promote any of its interests. The imprisonment of the debtor, and the starvation of his wife and children, are now perceived to be more than a just protection to the creditor, and severer punishment than misfortune and innocence should incur. To strip a man of all the means and comforts of life for debt simply, is to confound mistake and misfortune with crime, and to punish civil injuries as if they were criminal offences. The nearer we can come to converting legal debts into debts of honor the greater security will be given to credit. Law remedies avail but little against roguery, and there is the less reason for retaining their barbarities against honest men. Opinion would give us a better government than constraint has ever yet afforded. 
                
                
                   
                  "FOR OUR ALTARS AND OUR HEARTHS." 
                  UNDER the Hebrew Commonwealth and kingdom, the land could not be sold or alienated for ever. Neither king nor creditor could divest the meanest citizen of his right in the soil. The misfortunes or the crimes of the father could not oust his child from the possession. The cultivator of the land stood upon it the free tenant of the Lord of Lords, owning no other landlord. The homestead exemption, the homestead sacredness, gave to the man such dignity, and to the citizen such importance, that he could feel all the inspiration of the phrase, "My native land." 
                  Neither in conquest nor in defence were the soldiery of Israel ever excelled, while they had their own firesides and altars to fight for; and the noble institutions of Moses operated by their own inherent force in achieving the grandeur of the nation, accomplishing really much more for it by their natural potency than the miracles which only relieved the people occasionally in great emergencies. 
                
                
                  FREEDOM OF THE PUBLIC LANDS. 
                  SECRETARY WALKER, in his late annual report, recommends a reduction of the price of the public lands to twenty-five cents an acre. 
                  According to a table of the Commissioners of the General Land Office, hereto annexed, marked P., it appears that our whole public domain amounts to 1,442,217,889 acres, which, at the present minimum price of $1 25 per acre, would make an aggregate value of $1,802,772,296. Regarding them, however, including our mineral lands, at twenty-five cents per acre, they would yield $380,554,459. Large as is this sum, our wealth as a nation would be more rapidly increased by the sale of all our agricultural lands, at very low rates, not exceeding twenty-five cents per acre, in small farms, to actual settlers and cultivators, and thus by enlarged products and exports insuring increased imports and augmented revenue; as it is obvious, even with liberal appropriations, that our revenue from lands and customs will enable us to pay the public debt before its maturity. 
                  This proposition bears marks of a concession to the rapidly increasing opinion that the lands of the nation are, and ought to be, the property of all, and an object of speculation to none. But, this abatement of price, while it looks toward meeting the ability of the industrious poor to purchase, and so rendering them more accessible to the most needy and deserving, is fatally faulty, in the fact, that it, as much as the higher rate, denies the principle, and still more than any higher rate exposes these lands to speculation. At twenty-five cents per acre, money will be able to increase its monopoly of them five-fold, and so more than counteract any good that the plan is otherwise capable of. 
                  The true doctrine is, let not the land be sold at all, but given in limited quantity, say 160 acres, to the actual settler. Forty dollars would be the cost of such a lot to the man who must strain every nerve to reach his location. This effectually excludes nine out of ten of those for whom the change is demanded, both on their own account and on that of their fellow-laborers in our crowded cities. 
                  The policy of the measure is to withdraw the industrious and enterprising man, whose labor gluts our markets, from a destructive competition with his fellow craftsmen around him-to avoid the reduction of wages to him and to them, which results from his presence and necessities, and so at once to secure the well-being and independence of all, and at the same time distribute productive industry better than limited means for travelling and purchasing lands at the present or any price will allow. 
                  A man of some means can choose how he will invest them, and the business for which he is best qualified. Destitution of funds compels the poor man to work at the business that demands or admits him, and, fit or unfit, he must submit. Freedom to labor is not too much to ask from the government, so far as it can give it, and this means opportunity for adapted labor, if it means anything. I am free to work at painting and engraving, but I am not capable of either. This is like the freedom of the gospel to the Indians, printed only in Greek. So of the trades and occupations from which the people and the children of the people must choose. 
                  The men of property and influence in our cities have not given the subject the reflection it deserves. Economically, merely, it must relieve them of their poor-rates and cheapen their provisions. The temptation of lands for the settling, would attract thousands of stragglers from the crowded workshops, who would not be able to appropriate forty dollars, besides travelling expenses, to the enterprise. And the control it would exert over the effects felt and feared from the constantly increasing immigration of foreigners, is of the highest importance. 
                  We do not now stop to argue the justice of the measure. The beneficence of it is proof enough of its rectitude and of its obligation. Who can tell how inspiringly it would come to the hovels of poverty? The unfortunate who has lost his faith in the world's equity and in the care of Providence, would look up with a start at the word which announced to him his right to a home, accorded by the justice of society. He would feel no longer that he is a vagabond upon the face of the earth; but that he is only a traveller with a home awaiting him. The bitterness of his rebellion against the laws of property would be taken away. Benevolences degrade while they relieve him, but the justice which offered him independence must compel his respect. Justice? In one respect anything less than this is a fraud. If the lands of the nation belong to the whole people, the extremely poor have no other way of getting their share. To put their price into the treasury for the support of government, relieves only those who have other property to be taxed. The destitute man has none, and his land is thus given to those who are enjoying their own share and other property besides. Fourteen hundred millions of acres ought not to be all taken away from the poor. 
                  The cheapness of land is all that makes the difference between the laborers of Europe and America now. The absolute freedom of our vast public domain from monopoly and speculation, and its consecration to the life and liberties of the poor, will protect us from the fearful curse of a degraded and hopeless caste, to consist of our own countrymen, born to no inheritance but toil; and of the immigrants from other countries, who have been torn from the bosom of their mother earth by the wealth which wrenches from them their blessing and birthright. Even for the sake of the rich, let there be no class of landless men-miserable multitudes, arrayed against the more fortunate class under the horrid battle-cry of "bread or blood." 
                  Capital has ample means and materials, without converting the free deserts on our borders into a marketable commodity and a field of ruthless speculation. Our National Independence and honor are secured;-the personal liberty and dignity of the individual man, whose pauperism converts his share of the Republic's glory into mockery, must be provided for and maintained. Freedom of the public lands to actual settlers in limited quantities and exemption from execution cution for debt, alone can put the masses into the actual enjoyment of that liberty which our institutions promise in words. This will provide for the wants of those who may avail themselves, and relieve the manufacturing districts of the pressure of competition for work, which must be removed, or-wages become the price of liberty, and labor sinks into bondage.

                  In Central India the wages of field laborers are now six cents a day, he finding his own food; women receive four and a half cents, and boys three cents. House servants are better paid, as they are obliged to wear rather better clothes. 
                  Thirty years ago a field hand cost his owner, in the Southern States, less than a dollar a week (interest on his price, and cost of keep); now, the cost is twice as much. 
                  In 1851, average wages at Lowell, Massachusetts, in the factories, for females, thirty-three cents a day; for males, eighty cents, clear of board; or fifty-two cents a day for females, and one dollar twelve cents for males, without board. The wages in 1840 were precisely the same there. 
                  The wages of labor at Greenwich Hospital, England, for carpenters, bricklayers and masons doubled from A. D. 1735 to 1828, (from two shillings and sixpence to five shillings per day). 
                   
                  The wages of husbandry labor in England, in the year 1700, were equal to the then price of fifty-four pints of wheat; in 1790, to eighty-two pints; in 1832, to ninety pints. (Sixty-four pints make a bushel.) 
                  From William Penn's cash book it appears that in 1699 it required 137 days of unskilled labor to earn a ton of flour-cash wages, thirty-three cents a day. In 1834, such a laborer at Philadelphia could earn a ton of flour in seventy-eight days-cash wages, seventy-five cents per day. Flour was, at the former period, $45.34; at the latter, $58.32 per ton. 
                  Thus, in 132 years in England, the wages of unskilled labor had nearly doubled, when estimated in wheat. In cash they had quite doubled, and in nearly all other commodities required for the support and comfort of life, they had many times multiplied their nominal value. Even in the year 1813, a cottage's Sunday hat cost 20 shillings, now 7 shillings; a shirt, 10s. 6d., now 3 shillings; calico, 2s. 9d., now 6d,; brown sugar, 10d., now 4d. In 14 years, from 1820 to 1834, cotton cloth fell from 12d to 6d. In these years the price of cloth diminished 51 per cent.; wages remaining in money-price the same. But what is more remarkable, the money-price of all the British and Irish products and manufactures exported from England had fallen in these fourteen years full forty per cent. The reduction continued steadily till, in 1850, $41.63 would purchase as much of all the articles which make up the multiform exports of Great Britain, as $94 would have purchased thirty years before. The money wages remaining the same, the real wages had more than doubled in thirty years in perhaps everything but wheat and house-rent. 
                  The wages of women in the United States, measured in the same way, have trebled since the year 1818-the period of the general introduction of machinery into manufactories. 
                   
                  The wages of husbandry in France have in like manner trebled in 130 years. While the process of doubling the real wages of labor was going on in England, the population rose from five to fourteen millions. 
                  The facts of political economy must have another and fairer hearing than the old school authorities could give them. Increase of population, and the unlimited multiplication of products by the use of machinery, do not depress wages, but on the contrary, the improvement of the condition of the laborer everywhere keeps even pace with all such increase. 
                  The laws which govern society are better than the disciples of the dismal science imagine. Life is not necessarily a battle, nor is humanity a failure. We have, indeed, a great deal to learn, but we have as much to hope for, which will come in the fullness of time. The present good of this faith is, that we can thank God and take courage. 
                
                
                  THE UNITED STATES OF THE UNITED RACES. 
                  The Chinese are flocking into California; the Hindoos are being transported to Jamaica, Cuba, and Guiana, with the current drifting thence, as well as directly from the East, into the Union, to be increased by the proceeding revolutions, whether successful or disastrous; Hungary, Italy, and, ere long, Turkey, will be swelling the tide; Western Europe is here already, principal and interest; we have four millions of Africans and their descendants; and Scandinavia is floating in, like the icebergs, to melt into the current upon our shores. 
                  Whether the varieties of the race began in one family or not, they are destined to meet in one family of people at last. 
                   
                  Here mountains cannot divide, nor tongues distinguish peoples. When Pagan Rome subdued the world into one empire, she still held the nations at a provincial distance from herself, and from each other; she tolerated their distinctive religions, and perpetuated their social diversity. The relations established by force had but small tendency to induce those which bring unity and harmony. But CHRIST was born, He proclaimed the equal worth of every human soul. He was a son of David, but he described himself the son of Man-the second Adam. He died for all men, giving them the new commandment-"Love one another, as I have loved you," and "He is not ashamed to call them brethren (to himself and of each other), for he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one." 
                  Papal Rome carried the idea one stage forward towards the destined fulfilment; gathering the tribes which accepted her faith into one spiritual fold, and, in a good degree, reconciling and uniting them in interest and policy. But it remained for Protestantism to shake off the shackles of civil and ecclesiastical despotism, which still hindered the brotherhood of the race; and, for Republicanism to furnish the institutions, and find the theatre, for the actual realization of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" to all men. 
                  It is coming, and must come. America has every variety of climate and soil, with all the accommodations of political and religious institutions, and room enough, besides, for the wide world's widest range of wants, and the happiest conditions for the furtherance of its welfare. 
                  Our system of federal unity will be found as capable of allowing and ordering, retaining and restraining, Mormonism as Slavery, in its separate States; and Catholicism and Protestantism will no more unsettle it than the gyrations of the earth and moon, in their scuffle for a compromise orbit, can shake the solar system out of place. The sun can stand the perturbations with which the sovereign States in his empire agitate his throne. They tug him about eternally; but with all his wriggling, his orbit, as he is pleased to call his constitutional stagger, never falls out of his own diameter, so that he is always about home; and even his eclipses abate his power and dim his glory, so little, that you must look through a stained glass, to see and enjoy them, if you like to catch him in an occasional difficulty. 
                  There is no use in falling into hysterics about our doings and destiny. We are wound up to go, and need nothing but a little regulating to keep us exact to the time. The pendulum swings on, regular, steady, and true; and when we strike, the world knows the time of day near enough for the regulation of its affairs. Nice calculations may show that we gain or lose a little upon the chronometer of the heavens, but it does not frighten us, for we are so well on with our work, that we have a handful of minutes to spare. We have a good start; we are on the right track; and, if we don't tunnel right through every obstacle in our direct pathway, we will, nevertheless, recover the route, with the loss of a little time and distance, and so reach our destination at last. 
                  It is bad citizenship to despair of the commonwealth. A man ought to love his country something better than a fellow who is always kicking his mother, to mend her manners. The dear old lady may "have so many children that she don't know what to do;" and when they "growl and fight as bears and lions do," she may be obliged sometimes to settle the hash without doing exact justice to all the little belligerents that she has to manage; but the family is safe, and will learn to behave themselves as they grow older and wiser. Some of the children are so stubborn, some so sharp, others so boisterous terous, and some of them so nearly silly, and all so selfish, that the household is always in disturbance. And, there are the servants! "But everybody knows what a plague servants always are, and ours do seem to be the hardest to manage in the world. If there was only some way of doing without them altogether, it would be such a relief. Some people say there ought not to be any. They are infidels, of course; for the Scripture says that there will always be poor people to be taken care of, and one oughtn't to wish what isn't allowed. But it does seem almost as if they were sent upon us for our sins." 
                  So runs the complaint, translated into the gossip dialect-which is the fittest for such grumbling that we are acquainted with. 
                  And now there has arisen a new trouble: the Chinese are gathering in such numbers in California, that the question arises, What if they were to apply for naturalization? They are not white, certainly, and just as certainly they are not black; and, partus sequitur ventrem! (which is Latin for cursing a nigger) these barbarians are free born, and cannot be legally reduced to chattel Slavery; for they were not caught in Africa, nor smuggled into the State in handcuffs. And what is to be done about it, the Alta California and the St. Louis Intelligencer are in a pucker to guess. They are not white, it is agreed, and this these editors would fain believe sufficient; but that will not do. White in slave-law language does not mean color, but descent. A negro is a slave, though an albino, with alabaster skin, pink eyes, and silver white hair. Trace the whitest and handsomest woman in Charleston to the stock for two centuries devoted to the American yoke, and she goes to the auction block, and the darkest-colored man in the nation may buy her and be her owner. 
                   
                  It is not color, but kindred, that settles the question. Cursed be Canaan, or Cush, or Quashee, or whoever has wool so curly that it first grows out of his head, and then grows in again; but any human being whose ancestors had hair long enough to wear tails to their heads, are out of the scrape. It won't do, gentlemen, to take the people who manufacture your silks, porcelain, fans, crapes, and carved ivory, and exchange their tea for your dollars, and reduce them to slavery. Nor will you attempt it. They actually have treaties with our Government, and our Executive sends no less a dignitary than R. J. Walker a minister to the head of their nation; and you are without principle, prescription, precedent, or prophecy, for your purpose. 
                  What then will you do with them? If they have the arts, industry and frugality, that are available in the civilized scramble for wealth, and you let them into the country, the municipal laws which are equal in their operation upon all the inhabitants, will secure their prosperity, and you will not be able to deprive them either of personal liberty, or civil rights and political power. You may exterminate the Indians, and hold the Africans in chattel slavery, but you cannot put civilization, well advanced in the industrial arts, under the ban of barbarism or of color. Their idolatry was an objection yesterday, but to-day there are a million of them professing our own religion, and to-morrow Christianity may be on the throne of the Celestial Empire. When they come to us baptized, with the ten commandments in their hands, and the faith of the Redeemer in their hearts, your religious reason for degrading and enslaving them will be nonplussed, and your piety itself will be their pleader. 
                  In short, the doctrine of despotism, ecclesiastical and political, which has served you so well and so long in the extreme cases to which it has been applied, is going to be gradually dissolved in the intermediate shades of coloring to which it will be exposed, so that you will not be able to tell black from white, for any purpose that you now make the distinction. Reason, religion and republicanism, have all failed with you; but now Providence is about to take you in hand, and you are as good as done for. 
                  If Fum Hoam can learn Christianity as well as silk-weaving and card-painting, he can substitute phonography for his alphabet of forty thousand characters; and, after calling you brother for a generation or so, in good Yankee, he will marry your cousin, and then, how will you keep him out of Congress? The "home of the exile and the asylum of the oppressed" will surely vindicate its pretensions, and justify its boast, by vindicating the liberty, equality and fraternity of man, in despite of your resistance. 
                  When the United Colonies revolted, they did not think of limiting the controversy to the Anglo-Saxon race, but they appealed to God and the world for the right of all men to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. God and the world took them at their word, and will hold us to the contract; and here, in these United States, every kindred and tongue and people under heaven will, ere long, sit down and enjoy the blessings which you think our fathers should have reserved as well as "secured for ourselves and for our posterity." 
                  And so, you will please to consider this matter settled by the fiat of Fate, and comport yourselves accordingly. 
                  
                     1853.
                   
                
                
                   
                  ENGLAND AND THE TURKISH QUESTION. 
                  IN 1776, Adam Smith said the whole object of the English system was "to raise up colonies of customers-a project," he added, "fit only for a nation of shopkeepers." Indeed, he thought it "unfit even for a nation of shopkeepers, although extremely fit for a nation whose Government was influenced by shopkeepers." That was her portrait in profile, three-quarters of a century ago. To give a full-face view of the nation, justice required that the beer and beef should be laid in, that the bully side of her character might fairly appear; but since that day, traffic has taken the tone out of her temper, and she has little left but the tricky pliabilities of a confirmed huckster. A little while ago she had pluck enough to mingle the "balance of power" somewhat bravely with the "balance of interest" in her foreign policy, but now she has so interwoven her own existence into the web of universal commerce, that she dare not for her life offend a customer. Her policy has long been to make herself the workshop of the world, the sole buyer of all the raw products of the nations, and sole seller of the manufactured commodities to be exchanged for them, with the power to fix the prices of both. 
                  By her treaty of Methuen with Portugal, in 1703, she obtained the control of the market of that country for the sale of her manufactures, agreeing to give, in compensation, the Portuguese wines a great advantage over those of France. The result is that the manufactures of Portugal have sunk to nothing, and her commerce, once the medium for interchanging the products of the East and West, has become a mere shadow. Her wool and salt go to England, her wines are monopolized there, and she has at last become a burden to her destroyer. 
                   
                  Turkey, also, has a treaty with her, now more than a century old; by the terms of which, that Governmet bound itself to charge no more than three per cent, duty on British imports. Her industry has long been paralyzed. Up till the close of the last century Turkey still exported cotton yarn in considerable quantity. Now, even its culture is abandoned; and her internal trade is in the hands of foreign peddlers. 
                  Mr. Cobden has recently said that these ancient allies of Great Britain have become a curse to her, and are no longer worth preserving. The fate of these two colonized customers of John Bull is well illustrated by the story of an Irish tenant of an English absentee landlord. The poor fellow had been for a series of years paying his rent out of his little capital, until it was well nigh exhausted; but as he had no better choice, and was still able to meet the rent, he asked a new lease. He was answered: "You are no longer entirely safe at quarter-day, you have been growing poorer year after year, and I must have a sounder man." 
                  India is another instance of the effects of the British system of centralizing the trade of the world in her own hands. Bengal was once celebrated for the finest muslins; the Coast of Coromandel for chintzes and calicoes; and Western India for the manufacture of strong inferior goods of every kind. Nearly a century since, the battle of Plassey established the British power over that wealthy, prosperous and happy country. To suppress the native rivalry of manufactures, every loom, anvil, barber's hone, cotton-beater's bow, carpenter's tool, oil mill, potter's kiln, iron manufactory, fishing boat, fishing net, was taxed to the utmost value of its productive power, and the result is told in the language of Bishop Heber-"an impenetrable jungle now surrounds the once great manufacturing city of Dacca." 
                   
                  Mr. George Thompson, not long since in the House of Commons, reminded the Government that at the close of the last century cotton abounded, and to so great an extent was the labor of men, women and children applied to its conversion into cloth, that, even with their imperfect machinery, they not only supplied the home demand for the beautiful tissues of Dacca, and the coarser products of Western India, but they exported to other parts of the world no less than 200,000,000 of pieces per annum. After the improvements in manufactures were fairly introduced into England, the export of machinery and artisans to India being rigorously prohibited, and free trade in foreign commodities established, so as to expose the native manufacturers to unlimited competition, the export of cotton from Bengal, in 1827 sunk to 285,121; and in 1847, a whole year passed without the export of a single piece of cotton from Calcutta. Since 1813, the export of cottons from India constantly declined, until it has at length ceased altogether; and the export of raw cotton has, at a corresponding pace, risen until it has attained the height of sixty millions of pounds. England sends back about twenty-five millions pounds of twist, and of cloth two hundred and sixty millions of yards. Thus every pound of raw cotton sent to England is returned manufactured, after having travelled twenty thousand miles in search of the spindle, and left nearly its whole value in the hands of brokers, transporters, manufacturers, and operatives, thus interposed between the producer and consumer. 
                  Mr. George Thompson, in one of his lectures upon India, sums up the results of the British rule there in terms so striking that we cannot forbear a few extracts: "Some of the finest tracts of land have been forsaken, and given up to the untamed beasts of the jungle. The motives to industry have been destroyed. The soil seems to lie under a curse. Instead of yielding abundance for the wants of its own population, and the inhabitants of other regions, it does not keep in existence its own children. It becomes the burying place of millions crying for bread. This, in British India, in the reign of Victoria the First!" 
                  The same system extended to Ireland, has reduced her population to exclusive agriculture, that they might be the purchasers of English manufactures. Ireland was prohibited from exporting woollens and glass to the colonies. In 1800, Dublin employed 4,918 hands in woollen manufactures; in 1840, 602! At Cork, in 1800, there were thousands of cotton spinners, bleachers, and calico-printers; in 1834, there were none. This is a fair sample of the condition to which the whole island has been reduced by British rule. The loss of 1,659,000 of her population, between the years 1840 and 1850, by famine, pestilence and emigration, expresses the facts, and indicates the tendencies, with the solemnity of a tombstone. 
                  The London Times utters the inference of Tory logic from the data afforded by English policy, with the terseness of tragic poetry. Speaking of Ireland, that paper says: For a whole generation man has been a drug, and population a nuisance. Ireland has been England's customer, till the expulsion of her people is the only remedy left for the burden which their redemptionless poverty inflicts upon those who have exhausted them. 
                  The British West Indies, kept carefully by taxation and prohibition from manufacturing any of her own products, were driven, first to insolvency, and then compensated for the sudden annihilation of their slave property, by an appropriation of twenty millions, which just covered their indebtedness to British bankers, brokers and jobbers! 
                  And so, in one grand round of ruinous repetitions, Turkey, Portugal, Ireland, India, the West Indies, have been sacrificed to her rapacity, and she all the less able to spare a cripple that she has made, or a fresh victim that she is watching for. 
                  The policy that in a century has reduced India from wealth to ruin, driven its population from prosperous industry of every kind into the cultivation of opium for the destruction of China, and the Hindoos themselves to the swamps of Jamaica and Guiana-that has impoverished Turkey and Portugal, and more than decimated Ireland-is distinctly propounded in Joshua Gee's work "on trade," published in 1750. He says: "Manufactures in American colonies should be discouraged, prohibited. We ought always to keep a watchful eye over our colonies, to restrain them from setting up any of the manufactures which are carried on in Great Britain. Our colonies are much in the same state as Ireland was when they began the woollen manufactory, and, as their numbers increase, will fall upon manufactures for clothing themselves, if due care be not taken to find employment for them in raising such productions as may enable them to furnish themselves with all the necessaries from us." 
                  The reasons given are summed up thus: "If we examine into the circumstances of the inhabitants of their plantations and our own, it will appear that not one-fourth part of their products redound to their own profit; for, out of all that comes here, they only carry back clothing and other accommodations for their families, all of which is of the merchandise and manufacture of this kingdom." 
                  Lord Grey, in 1850, phrases the policy differently, but presses it to the same object and effect. 
                  The system of a century, growing ever stronger and stronger, is, indeed, fully expressed in the "Centralization of Commerce in England," making her "the workshop of the world," making of themselves "a nation of shopkeepers," and substantially "colonizing every country she trades with." 
                  Let us see, now, how this system affects her in her proper function of maintaining the balance of power in Europe, and vindicating the public law of nations. 
                  The London Times of a late date has drawn out the argument, in an article upon English intervention in the quarrel pending between Russia and Turkey. Let the reader look at the involvement which this article confesses, and apply to it the criticism which our suggestions afford for the true comprehension of its meaning and drift: 
                  "By way of set-off against the novelty, the excitement, the enterprise, the popularity, and the possible glory of a war with Russia, let us just set down and count the cost. We could shut up the naval power of Russia in the Black Sea and the Baltic by costly fleets at both stations; steam always up, wind and water always having their way. We could easily enable Turkey to make a desperate fight, by enormous subsidies. We could protect our commerce from Yankee privateers, and other free-and-easy gentlemen who could take out letters of marque from Russia, by a recurrence to the old system of merchantmen sailing, like wild geese, in flights, with a frigate or two leading the way. We could suspend the whole foreign commerce of Russia, by a process which would double the price of our corn, hemp, and tallow. We could engage half the continent on our side of the quarrel, by surrendering every other question of honor, duty, or interest, we happen to have with each separate State. We could prolong the war indefinitely, by another national debt. We could stop it at our pleasure, by allowing Russia to take all she wants, with a little over for demurrage. With proportionate bribes we could secure the concurrence of other nations. 
                  "On the other hand, all the nations of Europe would be bankrupt, their principal creditors being in this metropolis. Their manufactures and commerce would be ruined, to the injury of those who consume what they make, and make for them in return. We are all so bound together that it is hard to say whether, in material consequences, we should suffer more by victory or by defeat. It is our unhappiness to have the largest stake in peace of all nations on the face of the earth, and, so long as we stick to that game, we are sure to win. The most orthodox war ever fought is only an Irishman's row-a game of cracked skulls and bloody noses-very amusing to those whose clothing is of little value, and whose natural integument is rather hard; but far from amusing to a gentleman who has paid five guineas for his coat, and whose face is susceptible of contusions. There is not a point in which that immense glass house which we call the British Empire is not liable to damage. 'A man that hath children,' says Bacon, 'hath given pledges to fortune.' We have children-we have colonies, we have dependencies, we have ships, we have investments, loans, railways, private debts-all over the world. By dint of hard peace-making, we manage to keep our creditors in tolerable order. They pay, as an omnibus-horse does its work, by the momentum of their misery-by being kept in harness, well up, and continually flogged. Once give them the opportunity of war, and that general dissolution of morals that is sure to ensue, and every quarter-day will add to your defaulters. All this, of course, is very extraneous to the real merits of the present question. Those merits we do not here discuss. But you have known people who in private life went to law, or rather resisted actions, when the right was most clearly on their side, and when the verdict was given accordingly, but who, nevertheless, lost thereby, both in purse and in fame, having to suffer much annoyance to pay large costs, and to incur, also, the reputation of being litigious and troublesome fellows. That which happens in the regular and genial atmosphere of English society, and under the pure and impeccable administration of English justice, may easily happen in the society, and forum, and arena of nations, viz: that the prosecution of the justest quarrel may entail a martyr's obloquy and cross." 
                  Does this mean anything but that Great Britain is bound to keep the peace of the world, against its interests and her own honor, and to submit for herself to any injury and indignity that her universal trade and monopoly of manufactures may in any emergency require; and aid and abet, besides, any outrage upon the oppressed nations of the Continent tinent, whose defence might involve a general war? Call upon her now, for any influence or agency that justice and duty demand; and her honest answer is, that she cannot afford it. 
                  How have the mighty fallen! This it is, to be a nation of shopkeepers; this, to have converted herself into the workshop of the world. 
                  England is rapidly running down to rank among the meanest of the nations. She is a bully, indeed; but then she is also a huckster, and her duties are measured by the yard-stick; and all her fine qualities and all her traditional honors go for nothing, whenever her trade is endangered! Russia can browbeat her; South Carolina can bluff her off; for, behold, she has adopted peace principles as a fundamental morality in the policy of trade. Perhaps she may discover that it is best, upon the whole, to get France embroiled on the continent; perhaps France may precipitate her into the struggle; but an embargo or a blockade is her terror, next to extermination. 
                  
                     1853.
                   
                
                
                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. 
                  A FRIEND has handed us an editorial article cut from the North American, which was published some months ago, when the bill for the abolition of the death penalty was before the legislature. It takes the ground that the "object of punishment is self defence;" "it is the protection of society by inspiring a fear that may deter from the commission of crime. 'Society must deter from crime by the terror of punishment.' 'The question is, what penalty will, without unnecessary torture, inspire the greatest horror? It is death for death.' 'As most powerful to deter, it is necessary to the safety of society.' Murders are multiplying with frightful rapidity: is such the proper time to relax its penalties?" 
                  Yes, murders are multiplying with frightful rapidity. A week or two since there were eight persons in our County Jail charged with homicide. This is indeed a frightful increase. In fifty years, the criminal calendar of this county exhibited but one hundred and ten cases; only ten of these were convicted of murder in the first degree, and no more than five of them were executed. And of these five, it is worth remarking, that Lieut. Smith, who killed Captain Carson, was perhaps the only gentleman-the only man that anybody cared to save from the gallows. 
                  Now, the death penalty has not been abrogated. It is in full force; nothing of its proper power to protect society by legislative interference has been abated; and nothing, for which the opponents of the gallows are responsible, diminishes its influence to defend the lives of the people. It has the freest, fullest sweep that, in its own nature, it is capable of; and therefore, has had among ourselves the fairest trial of its supposed efficacy. 
                  Its friends have the unembarrassed use of all its power, to "deter from the commission of crime." Every man who is opposed to inflicting death by law for murder, is, by the rules and practice of our courts, excluded from the juries which pass upon the guilt of the offenders. Every man is put to the question, by the attorney-general, concerning his sentiments upon this subject, before he is permitted to enter the jury box. We have seen more than twenty persons rejected in this city in one murder case, on this account. The tenderness or conscientiousness of the abolitionists is never in any case permitted to affect the result. They are not chargeable with the escape of a single criminal, who by the law incurs its utmost penalty. No man either on the bench or in the jury box, except those who have no scruples or objections to hanging, ever sits in judgment upon the life of a murderer. 
                  Where then is the fault that murders multiply? Wherever it lies, the gallows does not deter as its advocates assume. There is the North American's mistake. It is not a foolish philanthropy of ours that leaves life defenceless. If there be any better way within the reach of the community, it is the mistaken cruelty of the gallows party which must bear the blame. The editors simply assume the position that, "death for death is the most powerful to deter," and quote poetry to prove that "the weariest and most loathed worldly life is paradise to what we fear in death." They make no appeal to the world's experience of the scaffold's protective power, and they offer no philosophy for the opinion. 
                  We cannot now, within the space allowed us, confront them with the facts which might determine the point most conclusively. They can find them, if they wish the information, in unanswerable array, in Livingston's Criminal Code, page 213, et seq., and elsewhere in works of acknowledged authority. 
                  They must know that many a foolish notion has passed current in the world, for a long time, though right reason and every day's experience contradicted them. This imagined dread of violent death may be one of them. Death on the battle-field is, in general, a pretty fair probability, yet men enlist without the impulse of the highest motives. Street rows and suicides, brawls and duels, afford no evidence of this terror; and reckless wretchedness and furious passions are notoriously blind to the risks they run. Nay, thousands of violent men distinctly contemplate the fatal issue, and adventure it deliberately. The fear of death is not the strongest instinct of disordered or distressed humanity. 
                  We agree with the advocates of capital punishment that, society has the right to defend itself-that, it is its duty to protect its members against the murderer, and that, it may take life if that is the remedy. But we deny this-just this. Give us something more conclusive than poetry or ill considered opinion upon this point. We deny that either the facts of experience or the truth of philosophy, support the position which the North American assumes, unquestioned and unproved. 
                  If they can settle this point for us, we may inform them what we mean by our duty to the criminal himself. In the mean time, we have the right to tell them that scoffing at our kindness to the criminal is unbecoming Christian men, and that charging it to improbable and impossible motives, is not creditable to their understanding. Do they really think that any reformer of the criminal code prefers the comforts and happiness of the murderer in prison, to the life of his victim, and the security of society? If they do not, it is extremely improper to employ the language which they use in this part of their remarks; but if they do believe that the reformation of the offender, and such kindness as may consist with that object, means indifference to his crime, or to the safety of the community, they have something to learn that will make them better and happier when they know it. 
                  Their allusions to the New York prison festivals ought to be reconsidered. If they had witnessed one of them, and fairly understood it, they would never again speak of Mrs. Farnham's sentiments and policy with disapprobation. It is very sad to perceive how inconsiderate men become under the influence of prejudice and partial knowledge. "What becomes of punishment," they ask, "amid all this kindness, this luxury of smooth beds and luxurious boards?" Will the Editors tell us, if hell itself reforms no sinner, how human hatred and harshness will achieve it? Or do they hold that our penitentiaries are properly the shadows of bad things to come, and that hope and mercy are out of place for those whom human laws condemn? 
                  We know one story that would make them believe it better that ninety-nine offenders should escape than that one just person should be destroyed. We know another, of a Sing Sing prisoner that would reconcile them to any prudent effort to reclaim a vicious woman: 
                  A profligate from the Five Points, who had never known anything of the law but its severities, or of society, but its injustice, was committed for a long term on the charge of larceny. When she reached the State prison, supposing that its superintendent must be an ogress, when constables and judges were so unfeeling, she resolved upon resistance to the death. For weeks Mrs. Farnham met with nothing but blasphemy, curses, foul obscenity, and threatened violence, in answer to the kindest management. Her conduct was horrible past description. Here was a case that scorned benevolence and invited force. The philosophy of tenderness seemed at fault, at first, but Mrs. Farnham knew human nature better-she wrote to New York, learned the woman's history, learned that her infant had been taken from her, and that she had been convicted upon very uncertain testimony. She was indeed a profligate, but had some wrongs also to revenge upon the world that crushed her. 
                  Mrs. Farnham, with a mother's instinct, gave this girl her own child to nurse-it calmed her fury, convinced her reason, and softened her heart. In a moment the ruffian wretch shed tears, and submitted to the law of kindness. 
                   
                  We saw her one year afterwards; her cell door was never locked upon her. She read "the pleasant pages of London and Paris literature in her luxurious hours of leisure," the Bible, Episcopalian prayer-book, Walter Scott, Miss Martineau, Mrs. B.'s Conversations on Philosophy, and the North American, perhaps, occasionally. On the 4th of July, a gentleman of New York sent bouquets of flowers to each of the seventy women in prison, and one costly and specially beautiful one, to be presented by the matron to the most deserving. She referred the decision to the free vote of the women themselves; with one dissenting voice only they awarded it to that wretched girl, in testimony of their regard. Mrs. Farnham approved their choice. And the Editors of the North American would have felt the "luxury of philanthropy" and understood its policy, too, if they had been there to see. 
                  It is only fair justice, however, to state that some of the criminals themselves disapproved the system. One old lady of sixty, thought "there ought to be more preaching and less lightness of behavior among them young flirts." She knew human nature, and hated everybody accordingly, but she liked whisky and petty larcenies. The happiness of those around her was rudely discordant to her staid principles. 
                  The Editors are entitled to another authority in confirmation of their opinion. A good old lady saw Mrs. Farnham on a steamboat, and when she learned her name, broke out with "That's the woman that lets them nasty abominable girls in the penitentiary jump the rope and dance in the yard, and sing so that they can be heard clear outside of the wall! It's too bad; if the jades must sing, why don't she make them sing in to themselves!" 
                  No danger that "the wisdom of centuries will be overturned" universally. There are some specimens of human clay too hard baked to allow "horror of crime" to be obliterated by the tears of a "sickly sentiment;" no danger that the "reform of the criminal" will ever be their "main object." But there is no telling what may happen when these bully-rocks of conservatism are all dead.

                  THE FOURTH STREET MURDER-CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. 
                  WE need not give the particulars. They are published in detail in the dailies, and known to all who take any kind of interest in them. The murderer is in prison. His examination shows that he is a brutal creature, capable of almost any crime. He shows but little sensibility of his own danger, and no compunction for his shocking crime. It is said that he is one of the wretches which foreign governments are in the practice of transporting to our shores from their jails and poor-houses, to serve out their time here as paupers or criminals, just as they are disposed and qualified. 
                  The lex talionis party have possession of the case, and he must either be hanged or lynched; and even then the sentiment which demands vengeance will not be half satisfied. It is in fact true that a dozen such lives as his could not expiate his crime, or settle his account with public justice. But what more than killing him can be done, or might be desired, we cannot say. A lady (one of a thousand perhaps) insisted to us that the punishment of death is not nearly severe enough for the case; we quietly suggested that the unsatisfied balance of her indignation might be transferred to his account in the next world, and the Judge of the dead requested to wreak its full measure upon him there, after the utmost penalty of the law is inflicted upon him here. She seemed startled at the thought, and changed the argument from revenge to that of the public defence; but in this aspect the case in hand is particularly unmanageable. 
                  The apprehension of the death penalty did not prevent this murder; this, the most monstrous of its kind, the strongest instance in its class, is the very case for which the gallows is no prevention. Langfeldt had neither friends nor wealth, nor was there any reasonable prospect of concealment or escape. No conceivable case could more fairly test the protective quality of the death punishment. The crime and the penalty stood together, as close linked as cause and effect, and clear enough for the bluntest intellect that leaves a man responsible for his deeds. And just in this case it proved utterly worthless. 
                  Langfeldt is familiar with public executions; he knows nothing of government but its severities. He was born to infamy, educated in crime, his whole life has been a warfare with the law, and the gallows has ever been the clearest probability in his fate. He, a foreigner, a convict, friendless and odious, could promise himself no advantage of that tenderness of life which is blamed with favoring these atrocities. On the wide earth there was no eye to pity, and no arm to rescue him from the death he deserved and dared. Yet the frowning gibbet, with all its terrors full in his view, afforded no protection, not the least, to his hapless victims. It never did, it never will deter a Langfeldt from shedding blood. The gallows is a miserable reliance against the brutal wantonness of all such criminals as this man. 
                  Upon what proportion of lawless men it operates advantageously we cannot say. But that it is small we feel assured. The cunning and cautious criminal expects to evade it; and the man of furious passion gives it no thought or heed till the deed is done. The few upon whom it acts as a restraining dread, have but little of the character that makes men dangerous, and are as likely to be deterred by the apprehension of life-long imprisonment. 
                  The cold-blooded murderer is as unfit to live as he is to die. Say he deserves death here, and if you please, eternal pain hereafter; does it follow that it is right and best for us to inflict the one in vengeance, any more than to pray and labor to involve him in the other? May we hurry him off in unrepented guilt, and so secure his final ruin? Hatred cannot go so far as this without becoming more horrible than the crime it seeks to punish. Or should we give him a little time for repentance, and then, when justice is appeased and guilt atoned for and removed, despatch him? In plain words, shall we hang him either into hell or into heaven!! The first seems too bitter even for an enemy, and the latter is not kind enough for a brother, redeemed and sanctified. 
                  Human tribunals never can measure the absolute guilt of crimes; they are not qualified, and they have no right to inquire into this quality of wrong-doing. Self-defence belongs to every individual in society; self-defence belongs to the aggregate of individuals in a community: revenge belongs to neither, it is a sin in both, and as much a wrong to the subjects of public as of private hatred. The Heart-searcher and Rein-tryer alone is competent to ascertain and discipline the guilt of sin. 
                  Men and communities may and ought to protect themselves against injuries. If this requires life, let them take it; if it does not, the deed is as much a murder as if the victim were as innocent as an infant. Confinement for life is as complete security against the convicted criminal as the scaffold; and executive clemency is even less likely to be interposed in favor of liberty than of life. And, that it will deter others as effectually as the risk of a speedy execution, is at least probable enough to authorize the experiment. We do not rest our opposition to the death punishment upon the ground of the inviolability of life, but because there is no sufficient reason for it in civilized societies, fully furnished, as they are, with all the means of self-protection and defence, and under heavy obligations, besides, to the criminal whose provocations and temptations to commit offences are, in most cases, chargeable upon the political and social systems which claim the right to punish them. 
                  Until society has done its duty to the poor, the ignorant and the profligate, it cannot justly demand the last drop of blood from the wretches who violate its laws. 
                  When the fortunate and unfortunate, the respectable and the abandoned, meet where the force of circumstances are justly estimated, and the standard of judgment is absolutely perfect, we will know why God requires mercy rather than sacrifice, and why is it fitter for us to forgive than to revenge our wrongs. 
                  We plead for the life of the criminal because we doubt both the propriety and policy of destroying it, and especially, because we believe that additional security would be given to the community, by the sentiment that, no cause whatever can justify the shedding of human blood for crimes committed against either communities or individuals.

                  THE SABBATH. 
                  THE word Sabbath, in the Hebrew language, signifies rest, or cessation, and is, strictly, the name of the institution. Sunday is the name of the day adopted, by the majority of Christians, for its observance. The ancient Greeks and Romans had no division of time properly answering to our weeks. The former divided the month into three decades of days; the latter had their nundin, or market days, occurring every ninth day; but neither of these had either the references or uses of the week and the Sabbath. But the Egyptians and the oriental nations, in the still more ancient times, had a week of seven days. It is believed that the Romans adopted the hebdomadal division about the beginning of the third century after Christ. They named the days after the planets or heathen gods. It is worthy of notice also that our names for the days had a similar origin, as will be seen by tracing their Saxon derivation. Pritchard quotes Bosman for the fact that the Karabari, and several other tribes of Western Africa, have been long acquainted with the division of time into weeks, and each day of the seven has its proper name in their language. Their Sabbath falls on our Tuesday, except at Ante, bordering upon the Mohammedans, where it agrees with theirs in being fixed upon Friday. Among these barbarians, fishing only is prohibited upon their Sabbath bath; in respect to other occupations they make no difference. 
                  The division of time into periods of seven days among nations, not governed by our sacred books, or not indebted to Moses for the sabbatical institution, may be accounted for, perhaps, by the fact that it is a natural quartering of the lunar or apparent month, and the nearest that can be effected without breaking a solar day into fractions for the purpose. That is, if the lunar month is divided in half, and again into halves of that half, measured by whole days, which would be natural enough among barbarous people, seven days are the result, and so the week would occur in their computations of time. 
                  There is another natural measurement of time by weeks, which we will take the opportunity briefly to exhibit, without designing now to offer all the instances which we think support it, or to exhaust the argument on which it rests. 
                  The proposition which we submit is, that the weekly period and the rest-day are well founded in the natural constitution of man, and might even be inferred from it; or, more specifically to present the point now in hand, there is a physiological reason for such a period and such an institution-a hebdomadal circle in the movements of the human organization-a cycle of actions which complete their round in seven days, and this circuit of movements is specially adapted to our week and rest-day. 
                  Hippocrates, who lived six hundred years before Christ, and in a country which had not the weekly apportionment of time to suggest his idea, taught that fevers changed for the better or worse on the seventh, fourteenth and twenty-first days. The highest authorities in medicine, for ages, received and endorsed this opinion. In modern times, by the interpolations of an humble race of physicians, the critical days of fever were made to embrace other minor periods of marked changes, until the whole twenty-one were filled up, and the doctrine fell into disrepute-a misfortune that scientific truths often suffer by the improvements of decidedly uninspired men. 
                  There is, beside the septenary period with which the true critical days correspond, a clear diurnal movement in the system, very well marked in health, and often exhibiting its effects in disease; as an ephemeral fever, the quotidian, tertian, and quartian ague-the first exhausting itself in one day; the latter recurring at intervals of one, two, and three days. Changes in the progress of fevers at these properly diurnal periods have been confounded with the septenary movement, and, of course, obscured its manifestation. Moreover, the vigorous remedial treatment of modern times, doubtless, interrupts the more natural progress of febrile phenomena, and further contributes to conceal and confuse the facts upon which the old doctrine of crisis rests. 
                  Nevertheless, it is well supported by our most distinguished authorities. Hosack and Dickson of New York, and Eberle and Wood of Philadelphia, are clear in their adhesion to it; and one of the sects of modern medicine makes that obvious periodicity, of which this is one of the instances, the basis of its distinctive theory and practice. Among the great names of foreign countries, whose observations have confirmed the doctrine as it was taught by Hippocrates, we may mention Cleghorn, who practised on the shores of the Mediterranean; Balfour, in the East Indies; and Jackson, in the West Indies. 
                  A striking fact, at once clear and unembarrassed, deserves especial regard, to wit: the tendency of miasmatic fevers to return after being checked, at the end of the first, second, and third week-most frequently at the end of the second. Professor Wood, of the University of Pennsylvania, who has no theory to support by the observation, says "this tendency is quite inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge." Practitioners, we know, who reside in the middle counties of Pennsylvania, continue the use of quinine and bark till the eighth day after the last paroxysm, or resume it the day before the seventh, to meet the known liability to relapse at the septenary period. Doctor Samuel Dickson, formerly of Charleston, and recently of the New York University, says; "The septenary period is almost as well marked as the diurnal." Again: "The combined influence of the diurnal and septenary revolutions, liable, perhaps, to other complications more obscure in their nature, will account for all the types of fever, and all the phenomena of periodical repetitions of diseases, as well as of crises, or the agency of critical days." Speaking of the latent period of fever, or the time intervening between exposure to marsh effluvia and the development of the disease, he says: "This period is known to be under the influence of the ordinary revolutions which give periodicity to disease in general. The apparent influence upon it of the septenary revolution, is familiarly noticed in our climate (South Carolina), where the opportunities for observation are unfortunately distinct and frequent. Our 'Country Fever' is expected to invade on or about the 7th or 14th day, and if the 21st passes without an attack, most persons consider themselves entirely safe." 
                  The small pox and vaccine disease, and several others which run their course unaffected by treatment, in a very marked manner, show this seven-day movement of the system; and there are, besides, a host of observations which help to establish it as a law of the human constitution. In the healthy state, the reproductive functions are singularly well marked, not by periods of single weeks, but by exactly integral multiples of them. Attention to this point will abundantly sustain this assertion. Diseased manifestations are the better indexes, because they exaggerate the natural movements in the human system, and the more distinctly proclaim them; but the facts of health are also very conclusive. 
                  Let us look a little more closely at the general law of periodicity as it rules the human organism, for the help and direction that its specialities afford to our inquiry: 
                  Alternate action and repose, in the actions of animal life, is a general law. The diurnal revolution is well understood. The complete rest of all the functions of relative life, and the comparative abatement of activity in the vital organs, once in twenty-four hours, is a plain necessity of our existence. This law obtains even in vegetable life. And it is a pertinent remark that, wherever the instincts of animals and plants absolutely rule the actions of the being, the law is punctually obeyed. The simple day and night revolution of animal and vegetable life suffices for their constitutions. The external senses, the muscles of locomotion, and the nerves, which cooperate in their activities, are often held to their objects and exerted in their offices for hours together, without the least intermission, for they are under the direction of the will; but they obtain a complete release during sleep, and all the restoration which they require. The animal portion of man, and the entire nature of birds and beasts, living according to nature's free impulses, are sure of their daily repose, and guarded, besides, by the feeling of fatigue, which restrains abuse, need no Sabbath for periodical recuperation. But the organs of thought and feeling are not so well protected. They are usually more severely tasked, their weariness is less distinctly felt and understood, and their pleasures and excitements are more impulsive. The faculties employed in the 
                     business avocations of life, embracing literary as well as commercial and industrial pursuits, and the passions involved in their activities, are in all active temperaments burdened every day, quite beyond the moderation consistent with health. The merely animal functions of the frame take better care of themselves than these higher and freer faculties of our nature usually do. Moreover, the excesses and diseases of those organs which are the material instruments of mind, do not generally originate in themselves, but in the irregular excitation which they suffer from the mental and passional powers. It is these master-wheels in the machinery of phrenic life that drive the subordinate activities of the frame into abuse. It is, therefore, for these controlling forces of the mind that regulating and restraining checks are specially required. Day after day their tyranny tasks the inferior powers to exhaustion, which otherwise would take care of themselves, as they do in the animal kingdom; nor do, they always rest even in the sleep of their wearied instruments; dreams prolong their vigils, and they lie waiting and watching the first waking motions of the day-laborers in their service, to drive them yawning to their endless work. 
                  It is the engagements which we call the business of our lives which transcend their proper limits, and break the natural balance of healthy moderation. It is these, therefore, that need a regularly recurring rest-day. It is too much that every waking hour shall be given to our common work-that every day of our lives shall be crowded with our ordinary anxieties of thought and feeling. All this should be wholly intermitted at regular returns, adapted to our constitution, and calculated to obviate the evils of artificial life. The fourth commandment, it seems to us, answers exactly to this necessity: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work. On the seventh day thou shalt do no manner of work." It does not, in terms, enjoin public worship; perhaps it does not imply it as a universal requisition; and our municipal laws are all the more just and right that in this they very exactly correspond. They forbid ordinary labor, but they do not compel worship or any religious observances. 
                  The necessity for a rest-day is so universally admitted that it need not be pressed. It is required only that it should be more accurately understood, and it is to this point that our remarks are specially addressed. Our thought is, that only those faculties which are usually overstrained, and the instruments which they employ in their service, need the rest of the weekly Sabbath. Those parts of the body which, under the compulsion of business, get insufficient exercise through the week, even require such opportunity as the rest-day may consistently be made to afford them. "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." 
                  The seven-day periodic movement in the human system, conspicuously shown in disease, and not less certain, though less obvious in health, indicates one day in seven as the appropriate portion of time to be set apart for the renewal of the animal vigor wasted by the ordinary labors of our life. The intellectual powers, when they have done their six days' common work, require this relief. The full freedom and force of heart and mind cannot be preserved unless the dominant interests of ordinary pursuits are resolutely thrust aside at frequent intervals, and the powers, absorbed by them, are relieved by periodic checks. 
                  The higher and nobler faculties need the day also for discipline and development; and all these necessary and beneficent objects are attained, in the happiest harmony with the natural laws, by the proper and well-adapted observance of the day which Christianity has established among us. It should therefore be accepted. 
                  It is not necessary to the claims of a revealed or supernatural institution that it should be a novelty in human experience, or incapable of discovery by natural reason, or a violation of natural law. It is enough that it is right, and the authentication of such right is well worthy of the divine interposition. Indeed, the entire code of Christianity is declared by Bishop Butler to be but a republication of the natural laws of morality in their primitive truth and purity. The doctrines and ordinances of a revelation are even corroborated by their accordance with reason and nature, more especially, when such teachings are delivered in a dark and corrupt age. 
                  Thus far, we have spoken of the Sabbath chiefly as a day of rest for those functions of the frame and mind which constitutionally or accidentally require it, and we have admitted, also, that it may be a day of exercise for those which may thus most beneficially employ it. 
                  On this ground we hold that moral and spiritual culture, public or private, or both, as the case requires, should be specially attended to on the sacred day. This part of our nature needs such culture, certainly, and there is great advantage in making it exclusively the active business of the day, for the reason of its own high necessity, and for the additional reason that we cannot otherwise effectually throw the working faculties out of gear. The mind will not submit to absolute inactivity, and if not forced into a new track, it will obstinately pursue the old one, and so the over-worked week-day faculties will be cheated of their rest. 
                  It does not meet the case to answer that every day is holy, and that religion and morality should rule our whole life. These faculties demand a special and exclusive cultivation. There ought to be a whole day in the week kept holy to God and Humanity. Not only should the hurry and solicitude of business be suspended for the health of the powers which it burdens, not only should there be a break in the headlong current of mercenary speculation-a dyke to check the ruthless tide of selfishness-a day for clean clothes and fresh air-an interval of peace in the battle of life-but, the purest and highest sentiments which connect us with the spirits above and around us, in the holiest and most beneficent relations, ask such opportunity for fitting development; and we say that a sabbath should be devoted to all these restorative and educational uses. It is just because one day, at least, in seven, is not given to morals and religion, that their science is less understood in the present age than any other matter of human concern. 
                  We do not postulate the inspiration of Moses. Few persons know what they mean by the word, or how to govern their own thoughts and conduct by their notion of it; and in such discussions as this, it more frequently raises a war of words than leads to any useful conclusions. We believe it for ourselves in a very useful way; and we believe, further, that all the positive institutions of the Old Testament system will be found, upon candid and enlightened investigation, to be in accordance with natural law, though much modified by the exigencies of the times and people to whom they were given. An over-ruling idea with us is, that all the laws of God are made for the benefit of their subjects-that he does not give us wants and deny their healthy gratification-that he does not confer powers and for bid their legitimate activity-in a word, that he did not bestow life, and then take back one-seventh of it arbitrarily for his own purposes, to the injury or deprivation of his creatures. We look, therefore, for the beneficial reason of commandments imposed in his name; and when we find such utilities as the rest-day embraces, we have no doubt of the obligation, as we have none of the resulting benefit. 
                  Religion and morals, we are aware, are separate and distinct things. They are often divorced; as often, unhappily, by the devout as by the profane. Pious people often overstrain the sanctification of the Sabbath, from an earnest fear of injurious consequences that might follow a reasonable relaxation of the Jewish Sabbath's severities. Our apprehension is, that divine service is not human sacrifice, in any technical sense, under the Christian system, and that the observance of the sacred day is put within the devout discretion of religious men, restrained by all that cautious consideration which is due to the general well-being of their neighbors; but what we write is intended rather for the use of those who reason so well that, though they are not constitutionally defective in reverence, are yet without the caution which it so usefully supplies to ardent minds. The freedom of the soul is even more precious than the truth itself; but boys do not know everything, and brains, like cats' eyes, however keen, are none the worse for the help of the feelers in dark corners. 
                
                
                  THE BIBLE QUESTION. 
                  No book, since the introduction of Christianity, has had a tithe of the influence upon the opinions and conduct of the world, that is justly credited to the Bible. Since the Christian epoch, all private and public economy, all institutions tions, domestic and civil, all international relations, and the whole range of the natural sciences, have been changed. The progress of the race in this period is so great and so varied, that conception fails to grasp it with adequate completeness and clearness. Nothing in recorded miracles is so wonderful as the difference between the facts of the world's life to-day and eighteen hundred years ago. Yet it is true that, at every advanced stage of all this change, Christianity was still nobler in sentiment and richer in practical good than the highest actual realization; and it is just as true that it is still as really in advance of all present attainment. Nay, the distance increases as the world advances, just as the view expands and the horizon recedes, to one ascending a height. Whoever applies the New Testament morality in the regulation of his affections and the conduct of his life, will find its correspondence and adaptation to his noblest powers and worthiest impulses. The system itself allows and authorizes its receivers to submit it to the test of such experience, and consents to be judged by the consequences of its adoption. But it does not submit its claim upon the faith of men to any of the thousand other modes of scrutiny which an indifferent criticism may choose to apply to it. 
                  St. Paul says, emphatically, that "the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Again, he says, "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him; neither CAN he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." St. John says the same thing: "The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not." Jesus told the Pharisees that they heard not his words, because they were not of God. To his disciples he said-" Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." He did not say they knew it in advance of their acceptance, or in the attitude of resistance On the contrary, he declares, "If any man will do His (God's) will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God." 
                  In these grand fundamental propositions the philosophy of the gospel system is found, so far as concerns the investigation of its truth and authenticity. It comes to men with the distinct assertion of their incompetency to judge its claims by any maxims or standards which they have, independently of it; and all criticism, separate from acceptance and submission, it repudiates. Not one of its teachers ever perpetrated so gross a blunder in logic as to concede the competency of ignorance, error and unbelief, to judge the claims of inspiration. The Book never argues the existence of God, or the possibility and consistency of supernatural communications from him. If it did it must begin by admitting its own revelations unnecessary. The man that already knows what can and what cannot be, does not need to be told what is. If he already knows what is true and what is false, the proposed revelation is merely impertinent. 
                  If any one answers that, "Imposture may take the same ground," he deserves to be answered that, no imposture is quite so stupid as to talk of measuring a new and higher truth by a known one that is worn out of form or fitness for the use which the revelation offers to supply. That absurdity is the peculiar distinction of skeptical rationalism. 
                  But Christianity is consistent throughout on this point. It treats its disciples just as it does its enemies. Jesus spoke in parables to the people because it was not given to them to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom; but he also told the twelve, in his last discourse, "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now." Paul tells the disciples in Corinth, "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able." 
                  Thus, it is not the policy of the gospel even to propose its doctrines to incapable subjects, much less, submit them to an incompetent criticism, and invite its decision. 
                  It is very clear that communication depends upon receptivity; that a pint bottle will not receive a quart of liquor; and that men are judges of truth and beauty, in art, nature, morals and religion, only in the proportion that they have the correspondent ideas and feelings in themselves, or, according to the maxim of Christ, "to him that hath shall be given," for he only can receive; and "from him that hath not shall be taken away, even that which he hath," because he does not availably hold it. 
                  When a controversialist, therefore, says this or that declaration of principles-this or that revelation of mysteries, is contrary to the nature and attributes of God, it still remains to be ascertained whether he knows God; and that is to be settled by his own resemblance or approach to the Divine. 
                  Some men reject the book, because the supernatural, with which it abounds, is impossible; that is, improbable to them. They reveal themselves only; and that does not affect either the truth or the fact of its revelation. The standard of truth, in anything, is the judgment of the highest endowed in that thing; whether it be poetry, music, morals, or reason. Negation by the defective is nothing. He is not the wisest man who believes least, for, believing least, he knows least that is positive and sure. No man is so empty as the skeptic, for he, of all men, knows least of anything that is certain and reliable, even by his own showing; and he cannot disprove anything of all the store that belongs to the man of faith. When a man says, "I have eyes, and I do not see that beauty which you adore," he has only proved that he does not see the beauty. If I see it, my testimony is evidence, because it affirms my belief and knowledge. His is not evidence, because it only asserts his ignorance negatively. 
                  The man that believes all which his faculties require and can discover, has a full soul, and a completed existence. His opposite, with all his sharpness, is only a beggared man, whose great boast is, that he doubts everything, and then doubts his own doubts, and, upon the whole, is always too hard for himself. 
                  But the authenticity of the Sacred Scriptures, and the authority of all their recorded examples, and the obligation of all the precepts which they impose, is a mixed question, and usually not a little confused in ordinary discussion. The book throughout may be as true as it claims to be; yet, every fact and every word therein written may! not be sacred and authoritative to any man now living; nay, a great deal may be, and is, by its own terms, or by just construction, the very contrary. Job is rebuked for his complaint against the justice of the providence which had afflicted him, and confesses that he had uttered that which he understood not; things too wonderful for him, which he knew not. "Wherefore" says he, "I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." David says, "I acknowledge my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me." Are the Scriptures and the religion they teach, therefore, responsible for every word uttered by the one, or every deed done by the other, even though it is said, in general terms, of the former, that he had spoken of the Lord that which is right; and of the latter, that his heart was perfect with the Lord? 
                  The book, however, does not leave us without a perfect example of life, as well as an absolute standard of doctrine and belief. Jesus said to his adversaries, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" And his own witnesses say that he was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;" that he was "the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person." His teachings and example are given us without reservations. St. Paul frankly says, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ Jesus;" and elsewhere, "as we said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed; "and, still more emphatically, "though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you, let him be accursed." The demand of the gospel is, "Take up your cross, and follow Christ." He is "the way, the truth, and the life;" and "there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." And "He is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption," by so conforming our lives to his, that we may be said to put off the old man, which is corrupt, and to "put on Christ." 
                  Discussions about the inspiration of the book are not countenanced, neither are investigations of its historical, scientific, or political accuracy, encouraged. They are nothing to the purpose. Its religion proposes to reform the life, and through that, to enlighten the understanding in the things which really concern our highest interests. If any man appeals to it for justification of his opinions or his deeds, he is to be answered that "the Gospel is hidden to them that are lost;" that it is not a directory for the business and ambition of the world-ling; that the unstable and unlearned only wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction, when they employ them merely as they would the provisions of the civil law, or those of a code of morals, for the casual endorsement of specific acts, while the life is utterly estranged from their spirit and government. If Abraham and David sinned in their private lives, or abused their official powers, in any instance, it is to be understood that the shortcomings of saints are no justification for the transgressions of sinners. And, on the other hand, if any one impugns the system which did not quite save its best disciples from error, he is drawing the unwarrantable conclusion, that there can be no truth where there is any mistake or misadventure. 
                  Moreover, the Scriptures do not ask the belief of the head, but of the heart; and that is given only by becoming in act and fact what they enjoin. Men must be transformed by the renewing of their minds, to receive the religion of Jesus; and all mere speculation about it is purely irrelevant, if not worse. The apostle, very likely, had these fruitless wranglings in his thought, when he told Timothy to keep that which was committed to his trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science, falsely so called. The promise of Christ, and the teachings of a sound mental philosophy, agree that he, and he alone, who doeth the will of the Father, shall know the doctrine whether it be of God. There is no reason, either of justice or mercy, why any one else should know the truth; for its only use is to be obeyed, and the disobedient are as well without light, as without goodness. There is a fixed necessity that truth and good, and error and evil, shall go together, here and hereafter. Correct opinions and a bad life are so sorry an absurdity, that no one need have any solicitude for such soundness of belief, nor fear any sort of evil from the lack of it 
                  The inspiration of prophets, apostles, and even that of heroes and poets-of the great and good of every faith and sphere of God's service-stands on the same ground. Who ever doubts it, could not understand or receive it to any good purpose, no matter how it might be proved. They must grow up into the light; it will never come down to them. There is light to the seeing, none to the blind. So we settle the Bible question for ourselves. Others, also, will settle it according to the life that is in them. 
                
                
                  ECCLESIASTES. 
                  THE freedom of the tongue and the liberty of the press are getting a demonstration just now, in the matter of popular lectures and their newspaper reports, to such an extent that it must have decided consequences some day soon. I think it concerns the pulpit not a little. Not long since, the clergy held the office of oral instructors of the people, almost exclusively. They limit their prelections to religious doctrines and worship, which the volunteer corps of lay teachers usually avoid, but both parties meet congregations consisting of nearly the same individuals, and the points of correspondence are numerous enough to induce comparison and criticism, notwithstanding the preserved differences of topics and treatment. This is the case with Protestant preaching especially. As our religious exercises are usually conducted, there is very little of worship proper in them. The prayer is by the clergyman, the music chiefly by the choir, the discourse occupying two-thirds of the time, and the people are in effect the audience, almost as much as at a scientific or literary lecture. They go to hear, and the duty of the place is pretty well performed if they listen decorously to the sermon. Now, whatever else there might be, or ought to be, in what we term divine service, it results in a pretty close resemblance blance to the better style of those popular meetings for merely intellectual entertainment, which are coming into vogue so extensively. The professional clergy and church going must be affected by it. 
                  The practice of uniting public teaching with public worship, may have authority in its use and propriety, but I believe it has no example in the practice of Christ, or of his immediate apostles and Evangelists. There is no instance, and there is no notice, in the New Testament, of a religious service or exercise in which worship and text-breaching, or any form of didactic discourse, were combined. This is worthy of notice. The Catholic and English Episcopal churches seem to have recognized the difference, and provided for their severance; both of them make a large part of the sanctuary service consist of prayer, penitence and adoration, and both are able by their forms to dispense with pulpit discourses in their principal solemnities. But the dissenting churches have a very different drift and policy, and the older establishments usually conform to the later fashion, perhaps from a necessity which arises out of the great controversy which has brought their respective creeds into debate. 
                  From one cause or another, the pulpit has become among us a sort of popular forum; enough like that of ancient Rome to bring it within the jurisdiction of public opinion, and subject it to comparison and criticism, in common with the ordinary forms of lay teaching. 
                  Am I right in the belief that we remember less of the thousand sermons which we hear, than of anything else to which we give our attention in a similar way? Am I right in the opinion that preaching is regarded with less earnestness and interest than any other kind of public discourses? What did Dr. Beecher mean by saying that the Devil appears to hold a mortgage upon the educated mind of the country? The pulpit, I suppose, must suffer or improve greatly under the influence of the new method, which is now growing into a system. In either case, it must experience such modification as deserves the attention of all concerned. The lecturers have advantages of the clergy in this rivalry, which must be looked to. The lecturer has all the leisure of the year for the preparation of half a dozen addresses; he has, besides, the chance and choice of his best points, and may be always strong and fresh. An itinerant ministry has these advantages in a good degree, also; but the pastors of all our churches in the thickly settled communities are stationary; and two sermons a week, with a multitude of calls for addresses upon the benevolent, missionary, and literary movements of the times, amount to a heavier draft upon them than they can creditably answer. Devotional feeling and sacred associations afford them some protection; but they will be compared, nevertheless, in pitch, power and interest, with the best of their rivals, wherever the new usage obtains. 
                  They have taught us to look for the matter and manner of eloquent performances. And they must fall under the judgments of the rule. 
                  There is the whole of Sunday, one day of the week, allotted to them, and they must either bring us back to unmixed worship in our churches, in which they have no rivalry of office, or they must fill up the time with such occupation as it may be the fashion to demand, or, they must fall behind the requirements of the times. The magnificence of church buildings, the parade of dress, and the relief of idleness, will come in time to contrast badly with pure devotion on the one hand, and elegant literary entertainment on the other. The Catholic method seems best adjusted to the exigency, and its recent successes are in this matter very instructive. There is nothing in the spirit of the age, nothing in modern institutions, in its favor; but Protestantism is losing its fitness to the progress which it belongs to and depends upon. 
                  The essence of Catholicism is authority; the spirit which it demands is reverence. Protestantism is but another name for liberty; and, by its own terms, it must earn all the respect it gets. There is no divine right in it; it is only a candidate for popular favor. It does not rely upon an ancient title, but claims, by improvement-right, and is always arguing its claims-it must therefore argue them well, or lose the verdict. The abuses of Mother Church did well during the insurrectionary stage of reformation; but for the fixed stage of positive organization, the new church must be adapted. The time has come that established republicanism wants a religion, and that of the age of rebellion will no longer answer the requirement. Let our clergy look to it. Popular revolution now runs back into arbitrary authority with portentous facility. The separation of Church and State does not work well for Government, where at the same time religion is divorced from politics. In Southern Europe (below the 50th degree of north latitude), the mischief has its power in the character of the people, perhaps; but even Anglo-Saxondom, on neither side of the Atlantic, will bear a religion which rests upon opinion, and at the same time falls below the advanced ideas of that opinion. Our pulpits ought not to stand by quietly, much less consentingly, while the obligations of the "Higher Law" are derided by men in authority. Their function is reformation, not conservatism; and if they miss their use they must lose their place. The Protestant religion was not made for submission to authorities, but for the ministry of freedom. The Catholic Church may well hold by the old martyrs while she is making new ones; but the priesthood of private judgment and progressive freedom must not resist the very spirit of its calling. The Church of the Crucifixion stands upon its memories; but the Church of the Resurrection must address itself to our hopes, or it has no appropriate function. 
                  Protestantism, from the first, opened its pulpit for the propagation of liberal opinions in government, learning and morals; when it loses this drift, it is beginning to die. When it allows political legislation to decide all questions of social duty, it sinks from a worthy priesthood into a servile police. Aspiration looks ever upward and forward; and if the Church crouches to the State, the uprising masses must look, not to the Church, but away from her to God. 
                  I write these words under a painful conviction that we cannot hope for efficient interposition, by the clergy of this country, for the restraint of injustice in our foreign and domestic government, just now becoming more critical than ever before; we could not get their help for such vindication as became us of the laws of nations, when Europe was in her struggle for popular liberty, and we cannot count upon their resistance, when we shall take the attitude of aggressors ourselves. 
                  Anglo-Saxondom will struggle long and bravely before it will consent to the formal reunion of Church and State; but the Germanic blood is religious as well as metaphysical, and will not consent to banish God entirely out of the civil Government. The best of our battles for liberty were fought while religion was part of the civil constitution of England and of these colonies. It happened just then that the church had the idea of the age, and served it well. Since then we have been killing Indians, extending black slavery, and conquering quering our neighbor's territory, until it has become our manifest destiny to spread and corrupt until we split. 
                  Our clergy must take this matter to heart; they must recollect that they are not the successors of the Apostles, but the ministers of the people; and that when a mere hierarchy is wanted, the old one has the better right, and the better chance too, as all current changes seem to indicate. Preaching against Catholicism will not any longer serve the purpose; they have been losing by that game ever since the controversy between Hughes and Brackenridge. The revival of Romanism began in this country at that time. They must do something which the age requires, in all questions of national and economical conduct; that is, they must answer the uses of the times; they must make us better; they mast begin to suffer again. 
                  A Christian ministry without persecution for righteousness' sake, without martyrdom in some form, is an absurdity; they must take up their cross, they must oppose the evil in the world, and carry the marks of the conflict. They must not be calling other people infidels, but they must expose themselves to all manner of evil speaking for Christ's sake, or they are none of his, and of no use to us. If the world were converted, and the Millenium had already come, they might be at once popular and worthy; but until then, those that the world loves are its own. The nation is in imminent peril of wars of ambition and oppression, with all their crimes, sufferings, and horrors. The religion of peace and the system of righteousness ought to have something to say to that; or, one way or another, the blood so shed will be required at the hands of those watchmen who give not the alarm. 
                  The uppermost thought in my mind is the present peril and prospective ruin of the church of the country, the church twin-born with civil liberty. I think of it despairingly; would it were otherwise. 
                
                
                   
                  THE FAITH OF CSAR'S HOUSEHOLD. 
                  "A CHRISTIAN statesman is the glory of his age" says Mr. Venable in a speech lately delivered in the House of Representatives. Some years ago, Mr. Clay offered a resolution in the Senate, calling upon the President to appoint a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, to avert, or mitigate, or sanctify, the impending visitation of the Asiatic cholera; he said, among other things, "I am not a Christian; I hope I shall be before I die." (He was about sixty years of age at the time.) He said, in the same speech, "it is natural to turn to God, when there is no help from man." 
                  Now, what is a Christian statesman? and how is he the glory of his age? Is he a Christian statesman, who, when his statesmanship is finished and his life just closing, says, "I trust in the atonement of the Saviour of men, as the ground of my acceptance and my hope of salvation;" adding, "my faith is feeble, but I hope in His mercy and trust in His promises?" Is it the age or the religion of the age that is glorified by the dying submission of a great man Surely it is not the statesman, but the man, that dies; and if his own notion of "salvation" is that it is something future, something after death-that a man is not saved from his sins in this life, from their guilt, power, and practice, but from their proper consequences in the next life-how is his Christianity the glory of his age? Is it not in fact, as well as in his own opinion, only his own escape, his own refuge, from the retributions of divine justice? Religion may boast the honor of a disciple distinguished in the world's opinion, if it needs an honorable endorsement! and such endorsement may help to make a similar profession easy to those who seek the honor which cometh from man; but how else a feeble faith, which in its nature is no more than a sentiment, excited too late to be a practice in any of the rectitudes demanded by Christianity-rather for their social uses than for their religious truth-how else a reform at three score and ten can be a glory, or boast, or benefit, is not all apparent. 
                  Mr. Underwood, too, says: "The lessons of His Providence remind us that we have higher duties to fulfil and graver responsibilities to encounter, than those that meet us here, when we lay our hands upon His holy word, and invoke His holy name, promising to be faithful to that Constitution which He gave us in His mercy, and will withdraw only in the hour of our own blindness and disobedience, and of His own wrath." Is this true? Is religion indeed thus separated from our duty to our neighbor? Are its obligations toward man justly ranked so far below the homage which it exacts toward God? Are the submissions of exhaustion, and the solicitude of a dying man for his own salvation, an acceptable substitute for righteousness of life, or an atonement for practical delinquency? 
                  The Christianity of the age is bound in duty and honor to repudiate such report of its requirements; it is concerned to insist upon its place and action in the every-day duties of life, especially in those which relate to the largest and most permanent interests of society. Religion must not permit itself to be changed from a directory for business into a policy of insurance, and so to be transferred from the concerns of time to the speculations of eternity. The Greatest Teacher employed every conceivable method to impress the eminently practical character of the religion which He established. Look at His Sermon on the Mount, which is a compendium of all His teachings. What warranty does it afford for exalting worship and faith toward God above love and service to man? See, too, how every parable of His corroborates the morality rather than the doctrines of His system; and especially when He lifts the curtain of the spirit world, and displays the principles and process of the final judgment; is there a word there that countenances the neglect or violation of duty to man, as a less matter than a sentimental faith in the atonement? It is true, of it is not true, that we shall be judged, every man according to his deeds done in the body; that we shall reap that which we have sown; and, that the cry of "Lord, Lord!" will not answer when the question is, what improvement we have actually made of our talents? Do the Scriptures authorize the magnifying of the Divine mercy at the expense of human duty, or allow that, flattering the Most High is just as good as honoring Him, or, that sacrifice is an acceptable service in lieu of obedience? 
                  Verily, it is an evil day for this world, when its religion is separated from its work, and an unsanctified morality is left to save men from their sufferings, and to mend their manner of life; and the whole of piety is reduced to the matter of worship, and the saving of men's souls after they are dead. No wonder that the higher law is formally excluded from the halls of Legislation, and that conscience is held subordinate to expediency and compromise, when all the good there is in religion is supposed to be just as available to the sinner as to the saint! 
                  "What is truth?" said Pilate; and turned away from the presence of its embodiment; for he meant not an inquiry but a denial of its existence in any system of opinions, and, of all certainty concerning it. Had he waited for the answer that concerned him in his office of Governor, he would not have baptized his hands to wash away the blood he was about, in the indifference of his skepticism, to shed. That man is the type of those who ask, scornfully or doubtfully, what is truth? or, what is its authority over us? And it is not too much to say that his despair and suicide are a better and more wholesome commentary upon his base and cowardly abuse of political power to gratify the public, than a late repentance, compelled either by fear or hope, or any other selfish motive, would have been. 
                  It is perhaps too much to expect tombstones to tell truth; yet there is nothing so sacred in sorrow as in the law by which we live for the highest ends of our being; and when politicians in high places preach, they must be held answerable to the canons of a just criticism. 
                  We are not interfering here with men's opinions in speculative doctrine; we are defending, in our legitimate sphere, the good of men's lives. We are concerned every way to insist that men's responsibilities, particularly those of men in places of political trust, both here and hereafter, are highest and gravest in respect to the duties which they owe to man, to the world, to the future of this world. We think it our business to rebuke the prevalent practice of judging the future condition of distinguished dead men. Our proper judgment is of their past work. That touches us who are alive, and all who are to live after us; and what have we to do with the final state of any soul, more than we should feel for the soul of every other man? If a distinguished life has blessed the world, God and man will in good time repay the benefit with "Well done good and faithful servant." But there is no room for favoritism here; justice is due to the living, and it were much better that any man die for the world than that the world suffer for him. Dust and ashes have no intrinsic merits. Truth to the living is of even higher moment than eloquence in eulogies and epitaphs. The Lord buried Moses in the mountain, and gave him no monument and no honors other than those of his works; He took up Elijah in a chariot of fire; nothing remained, either of the politician, or of the prophet, of Israel, but their words and their deeds. Nay, more; the Evangelists wrote no eulogies upon their deceased Master. The appointed memorial of His earthly life is in the symbols of His blood shed, and His body broken, for the benefit of men. That is His epitaph; and its voice to every man is, "Take up your cross also and follow me," not in profession and faith, but in facts and works, throughout your lives. 
                  In all this we are not objecting to any honors, public or private, which reverence and grief suggest for the dead, but to the pernicious doctrines which get some sanctity from sorrow, and too much allowance from fashion. We have no respect for lower law piety, even on funeral parade, and, for that reason, enter our protest. 
                
                
                  HERO WORSHIP. 
                  IT seems inevitable, and justified, therefore, by the instinct which prompts it. Moses forbade the paying of Divine honors and adoration to anything below the Supreme Deity, but the precept failed with the children of Israel. The Jewish Chronicles are crowded with their idolatries; and the prophet Ezekiel, summing up the evidence, declares that in this sin they had corrupted their way more than all the nations of the Gentiles. 
                  That excellence which is the hope and trust of the human heart can be realized only in its incarnate form. Unmixed spiritualism is absolutely impossible to our mixed constitution. The Highest can only be apprehended as the model humanity. Men believe that they are made in His image. When He is defined by the negatives of all that we are and know, the idea is lost out of our words, and we fall back again upon our own highest conceptions of wisdom, power, and goodness. The Pagan theologies, Egyptian, Greek and Oriental, all alike rested in such manifestations of the Divine as human faculties are capable of; they stopped short of the ultimate and absolute Divinity; and our own religion never spread throughout the world until the Immanuel, or "God with us," brought the central idea within the grasp of human faculties. We personify Infinite perfection, indeed, as we do wisdom, love, power; but our communion is only with such limitation and manifestation of it as we can identify and realize. 
                  The Divine messenger must come to us in human form or we cannot receive him. 
                  The doctrine which denies the incarnation of the Supreme Divinity is false to the human constitution, out of harmony with its necessities, and, by refusing such veritable embodiment of the Godhead as the mind and heart can recognize, merely installs a set of principles in His place-substituting Law for Being. 
                  Hero-worship, saint-worship, angel-worship, in the degree of their worthiness or worthship, and within the limits of their functions, is nothing else than the natural action of the same inherent tendency. 
                  Faith and hope look upward. "Every good gift and every perfect gift Cometh down from above," and we instinctively refer the greatest of them to the supernatural powers. 
                  History deals with the facts of sense only; but history finds society in conditions which must be accounted for; and, out of the dim traditions which precede it, never fails to construct a heroic age. The great men who discovered the sciences, revealed the religion and laws, and founded the cities and empires, whose origin is to be explained, are all Divine agents-they are heroes and demi-gods; they have human mothers, but they must have Divine fathers. From the deluge of Deucalion to the introduction of the Olympiads into chronology, the benefactors of men, whose works lived after them in the gratitude and admiration of their country-men, all received this sort of deification. Hercules, Perseus, Theseus, Castor, Pollox, Esculapius, and a hundred others, were sons of Jupiter, Neptune, and Apollo. These were honored after their death by annual commemorations at their tombs, and by offerings and libations presented to them, much as we celebrate the anniversaries of our own mighty dead with festivals, speeches, and toasts drank standing. Sometimes the respect paid exceeded these limits, and they were exalted to the rank and honors of gods. Even in this we are perhaps not utterly at variance with them, for it is a received doctrine of Christianity, that the Church is built "on the foundation of the prophets and apostles, Jesus Christ being the chief corner-stone." To us, as to them, the heroes of faith and the chief reformers of the world, were fully inspired, and we obey them as the representatives and ambassadors of the Most High. 
                  Moreover, "the mighty men which were of old-men of renown," are spoken of in the book of Genesis, as the off-spring of intermarriages between "the sons of God and the daughters of men." These were the giants, the Titans, of the Hebrews. The birth of Isaac, of Jacob and Esau, and of the Patriarchs, the heads of the twelve tribes, are all ascribed to supernatural interposition by the same authority. The same thing is affirmed, also, of Samuel and Samson and other heroes of the early Jewish history, and it is even repeated in the story of John the Baptist. 
                  Thus Nature is ever refreshed by the supernatural, and Providence is not a mere bundle of general, permanent, uniform laws. There is an oracle in the human nature, and poetry is its authorized interpreter. In an age of materialism, men may pay their devotions to mechanics, the work of their own hands, after the meanest form of idolatry; nevertheless, to as many as receive the Incarnate Divinity, the power is given to become the sons of God; their bread shall be flesh, and their wine the blood of eternal life. 
                  But this faith looks forward as well as backward. As it fades in history it revives in prophecy. If it dies as a superstition, it is born again a religion that inherits all its goods. In the Hebrew oracles it promises that "the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head," and, more definitely, "a virgin shall bear a son," who shall restore all things. St. Paul records the fulfilment in these significant words: "There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;" whom he elsewhere declares to be "the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature," "His only begotten Son." The language of Jesus Covers this whole doctrine: "I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of my Father that sent me," and, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Thus the universal truth is affirmed by our highest authority, and the instincts of human nature are justified while they are rectified. 
                  But, what says the natural religion of the pagan world to this doctrine of incarnation? According to the Brahmins, their Vishnu has already had ten Avatars or appearances upon the earth. Their sacred books say that he interposes in human form, whenever any great calamity threatens the world, and that he is always born of the Divine Spirit and a maid. Boodhism, which is professed by nearly half the inhabitants of the earth, teaches that there have been already four incarnations of Boodh in this world, and one is yet to come; or rather, each Boodh is a new existence, but all appear on earth through the medium of human parentage. According to Lamaism, the supreme divinity is in constant process of metempsychosis, and is always present on the earth in a human form. Fo, the god of Japan, was born of a nymph; the god of Siam is the offspring of a virgin and the sun; Juggernaut is the son of a virgin, and the Casta Diva of the Druids was expected to bring forth a world redeemer; and, to show the universality of the idea, it needs only to be added that the Paraguay Indians held, that, long ago a virgin bore a son who worked miracles, and finally rose in the air and became the sun. 
                  This necessity of the human constitution has its force in a lower application with those who refuse it as a religion. They, too, have a "better time coming," though they do not quite "look for a new heaven and a new earth;" and the agency and leadership of eminently endowed men is also essential to their hope. The redemption, with them, must have its champions, just as the religionist relies upon the great atonement, with its apostles and martyrs, for the consummation of his trust. Both alike understand that the redemption must be effected through the mediation of the same nature which sins and suffers. All through the ages of evil, prophets and heroes fix the faith of all men; the honors accorded to them vary according to the measure of man's apprehensions, but the feeling is still the same, whether it stints itself to the admiration of the sentiments, or stretches up to the stature of a religious worship. 
                  Man-worship, as it is opprobriously phrased, results from the fact that we apprehend nothing clearly which is wholly unlike humanity; and in spite of our most refined spirituality, we ever anthropomorphise the deity, however pure the worship ship of our human hearts, and however high the conceptions of our human intellect. 
                  The defence of the hero-worshipper is not difficult or discreditable. Nothing prevents but incapacity of heart or head, or, self-worship. It is a bullying style of dignity which refuses due homage to greatness, and it is always expressed with a swagger, except when the pretence is too limber with its conscious falsehood to take a sturdy attitude. It takes but little fancy to imagine the manifold elocution of the answer, "Is not this the carpenter's son?" which the gaping crowd offered against the claims of the great Teacher, who stood in his simple majesty among them. 
                  Next to the prophet himself is the man who discerns and receives him; it is for fools and snobs to congratulate themselves that they do not feel the difference between themselves and the pivot men of their time. Infidelity toward God is not so common nor so injurious as unbelief in man. It is well that there is not so much of either as would destroy the hopes of this world or of the next. 
                
                
                  ANTHROPOMORPHISM. 
                  THE Jewish religion, notwithstanding the almost miraculous tenacity with which the Israelitish nation has clung to it through eighteen centuries of dispersion and suffering, never had any proper power of self-propagation. Since the days of Moses, not a tribe or nation of the Gentile world, down to the present day, has accepted it. The reason of such general and persistent rejection of a system, containing so many excellences, both of civil polite and moral principles, must be in its intrinsic repugnance to the governing sentiments of mankind in matters of theological faith. Its civil code and social order were, during all the period of Asiatic and European barbarism, quite superior to any other system; and its criminal code was not specially exceptionable to the nations around it, but its doctrine of the divine nature, and the religious system thence derived, was, and still continues to be, wholly unacceptable. Christianity, though admitting the Jewish revelation as a fact, no more accepts its peculiarity than do the heathen religions prevailing over the rest of the earth. Indeed, the difficulties of the Jewish theological doctrine, which have ever prevented its spread among the nations, were so impracticable to the Jews themselves, that their own sacred books prove them to have been as thorough polytheists and idolaters in practice as any other people. While their lawgiver was yet with them they compelled Aaron, the high priest of the new religion, to make a golden calf for their worship; and, a thousand years afterwards, Ezekiel charges them with having "corrupted their way" by the worship of false gods more than all the Gentiles. The history of their Judges and Kings through the whole interval, is crowded with the proofs of their obstinate idolatry, and even Solomon, who built their temple, "went after other gods," and built "high places" for the service of the idols of the Moabites, Ammonites and the other gods of his thousand wives. Manasseh, after him, "built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord," and other kings of Judah put "the horses of the sun" at the portals of the sacred edifice! So that the simple and absolute spiritualism of Moses, which commanded, "Thou shalt have no other Gods before me; thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them," failed as utterly of securing obedience among the Jews, as it did among the heathen Greeks, whose divinities reached the round number of thirty thousand in the days of Herodotus. 
                  But a very small portion of professing Christians and a very few philosophers, have ever fairly accepted the doctrine of the simple unity of the Divine nature, rejecting at the same time, the notion of a celestial hierarchy, by which the mass of mankind in all ages has supposed the government of the universe to be administered. Perhaps it is not too much to affirm that no considerable sect or party of religionists, has ever yet embraced the simple spirituality of the Deity whom they worship. It is certain, at least, that the religion of the Bible never spread over the earth until it presented an incarnate God to the apprehension and faith of men. It is the Immanuel or God with us, the God-man, manifested in the flesh, that achieved the victory over the heathen systems, and it is through his name that we approach unto the Father. He is the way through which the faith that we call Christianity is received by the church at this day. An abstract Divinity is possible to the imagination of metaphysical thinkers, but human affections, human hope and worship, cannot get a firm hold of attributes and modes of existence wholly unlike its own. St. Paul meets this point fairly when he contrasts the religion of Jesus with that proclaimed by Moses. He says, "We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." "For, verily, he took not, on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham." And the Evangelist, John, says, "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father." In nothing, indeed, is the great apostle of the Gentile world more emphatic than that there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus," "who being the brightness of his (Father's) glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had, by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." 
                  The necessity of the human heart, here so fully met and answered, has led men all over the world, and in all ages, to invent for themselves Gods in human form, born of women, but with divine fathers; and Christianity owes its first element of success to the indulgence of this idea, while it derives its chief power to command human acceptance from the pathos of the Redeemer's story and the beneficence and beauty of his doctrines. We think that for these reasons the triumph of our religion is not a miracle, but far better than a miracle, in its perfect adjustment to the qualities and conditions of our humanity, and in its truth, which such adjustment demonstrates. 
                  Judaism defines God by negatives; it declares only what he is not, and what he is not like; it reduces him to an abstract power or principle, and so is nearly impossible of apprehension; but Christianity presents all that we can possibly receive of Him as an actual individualized being in the person and character of Christ, and he thereby becomes to us capable of distinct and positive realization. 
                  This idea must not be misunderstood. We talk of love, justice, power, holiness, goodness and truth, intelligibly enough, but they are only principles in our apprehension; we know them only by what we possess of them; we can only admire them as qualities of beings; but, only when they are impersonated in a familiar and knowable form of existence, in absolute perfection, can we love, worship, and trust in them, for all that we desire, need, and depend upon. A perfect or divine man only can be a veritable, tangible God to human beings, and, whatsoever is beyond this, or different from it, we can have no knowledge of and no vital faith in.-If we had no revealed incarnation of the Deity, we would, like our heathen brethren, of necessity embody our ideas of his character in some appreciable form, and, perhaps, most men do this, everywhere, after the fashion of their own conceptions, notwithstanding the formal faith which they profess. 
                  The conclusion of natural reason, therefore, corresponds essentially to the declaration of Jesus:-"I am the way, and the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by me." 
                  The character of the God is but the ideal of the worshipper; this is so, because it cannot be otherwise. The Deity of a harsh, cruel, implacable man is a very different being from that of a gentle, loving, merciful spirit. "Ye imagine me altogether such an one as yourselves," is the rebuke of Old Testament inspiration uttered against the profane fancies of a base and corrupt people, attesting the general fact which we allege, at the same time that the grossness of the false conception is censured. The necessity of a divine representation in an appreciable form is, nevertheless, taught by John, who declares that "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."-Jesus, to the same effect, says, "The Father himself which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape." Again, answering a question by the Apostle Thomas, he says, "If ye had known me, ye should have known the Father also;" and when Philip replied, "Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us," Jesus saith unto him, "have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Phillip? he that hath seen me, hath seen the Father." 
                   
                  But the same idea pervades all religions. The executive Deity of the Greeks and Romans rested in a divinized humanity. They pretended to no apprehension of the absolute and infinite Godhead. Their creator of the universe was also an eternal son. For him, and by him, all things were made; he, according to their system, "was before all things, and by him all things consist," as St. Paul says of the Christ. In the mythological story the King of the Gods took the dominion from his father; Jesus says, "all power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth." 
                  Nearer than such vicegerency in a divinized humanity, mortal comprehension cannot approach the Supreme, higher than this, mortal worship cannot reach toward an individualized Deity. Polytheism differs from the doctrine of Unity in the supernal power, only in the fundamental point that it divides the infinite perfections into many personalities, and destroys the harmony of their essential oneness in quality and action, just as if the several faculties of the human nature were distributed among as many individuals, making each a monster and a monomaniac by the divorcement. They divinized the virtues and demonized the vices of our complex constitution, and embodied them in a mob of celestial and infernal gods. Hence a perpetual war in their heaven corresponding to the strife of the unbalanced impulses in man. The true religion finds all perfection in One Supreme, and that supreme is the human nature carried up in idea to infinite perfection, but still in the form and fashion of manhood. 
                
                
                   
                  MYTHOLOGY. 
                  IT is not at all probable that the highly civilized and polished nations of antiquity meant to idolize and worship the vices which they ascribed to their gods. Their error in theory began in the separation of the various virtues which they recognized as existing in the pattern or Divine nature. The justice, wisdom, purity, and love of the highest style of being, they separated from each other, and ascribed to a plurality of divinities, providing an embodiment for each separate faculty in the analysis. Of these they had as many as they imagined were the faculties, intellectual and moral, in their ideal of supreme perfection. Such divorce of the qualities and powers which constitute the Infinite, works at once all the resulting mischief, making as it were, so many monomaniacs out of one integral existence. No faculty of human nature, however excellent, but becomes a crime and a madness so soon as it works unchecked and unbalanced by the harmonies of the whole nature. Justice runs into cruelty, mercy into misgovernment, and love to licentiousness, unless restrained and directed by all the feelings and ideas which meet the general relations of the life, and take care of all the interests and bearings of the case. Their Venus is a profligate, and Diana only a prude, but combined in one being they would have afforded a divine love nature, rich, beautiful and holy; and so of a hundred other cases. 
                  Especially is the system liable to misapprehension and injurious construction in the offices and agents to which they distributed the creation and current government, or general and special providence, of the world. Jupiter's amours seem monstrous, and the invention of the fables a wantonness, beyond expression and endurance, unless they are regarded merely as a mode of illustrating the generating and procreating, or life-giving power, manifest in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and referred by our religion, as well as theirs, to the Supreme Being, in words, instead of unseemly symbols and allusions. Put all the instances together, and they will represent collectively the "Author of life" to all forms of sentient existence. This being possible and probable, we but do injustice to human nature by putting a grosser and more literal construction upon the allegory. The luxuries of the senses were, indeed, coarsely authorized, but the abuse rested in the fact of independence of the lower enjoyments upon the higher principles and feelings; for, in themselves, they are allowable under such regulation as will harmonize them with the whole nature of man. So balanced, they are no mean part of the good of our existence. 
                  Their worship of the dead heroes of the earth was but the homage due to greatness, exaggerated by a lively faith in the power of departed spirits in affairs of the present life, or another form of angel ministrations. And thus the whole system, with all its abuses, can be reconciled to an idea deeper and purer than at first strikes the mind. 
                
                
                  HEAVEN-A KINGDOM OF USES. 
                  THE Egyptians held the immortality of the soul, and of the body also. Immediately after death, according to their theology, the soul appeared before forty-two judges or assessors (In their philosophy there were forty-two crimes or sins that a man might commit). If acquitted by all these, he was carried before Osiris, their chief divinity. In his presence the heart and brains of the person on trial were put into one end of a balance, and a feather from the wing of the angel of Truth, into the other. If he balanced the feather on this trial, he was admitted into the Elysium. But now his ordeals commenced; and the character of the discipline and tests bears some general resemblance to the ceremonial of Free Masonry. At the door of the Hall of Judgment, for instance, he was challenged successively by the door-sill, the right jamb, the left jamb, the door, the janitor, and by every tile in the floor, and every article of furniture. Each demanded of him its proper name, and the meaning thereof, and his advance depended upon the accuracy of the response. 
                  This is an expressive form of the Sphinx riddle of the Greeks. "Tell me my riddle, or I will destroy you," says everything which the spirit meets in its onward progress. "Pronounce my name, i. e. describe my nature-show that you know me, before you can pass me to higher experiences and achievements." This is the law of our being, and the condition of our progress. To know and to enjoy, are words that mean the same thing in our Scriptures; they mean the same thing in fact and in truth. Could there be a finer allegory, by which to illustrate the law of endless advancement and its requirements, than this one of the Egyptian Mythology. 
                  After the soul is pronounced "not guilty" by the forty-two judges, of any crime or sin, and after the judgment of Osiris decides that the heart and brain are true, then the ordeals begin-the trial, the discipline, of the ever opening future. How much more sensible this than the notion of a final trial, and a flat, insipid eternity of idleness thereafter! "Not guilty" will do to begin with; but the probation in the greatest affairs of existence only begins there, and the soul must work its way up to its destiny, or be ordered back. 
                  By the way, the Egyptians believed that when the spirit did not pass muster, it was sent back in the form of a pig, driven by monkeys, to begin its earthly pilgrimage over again. That second turn is not so certain; but the pig and the monkeys are capital notions, if it were so. Pig bodies with monkey drivers! There could not be a more wholesome horror than that. 
                
                
                  "ROMANIZING TENDENCY." 
                  THE Synod of the Reformed Dutch Church, at its late session in Philadelphia, resolved to suspend its correspondence with the German Reformed Church inasmuch "as the continuance of the same may be regarded as lending the sanction of this Synod to sentiments and doctrines which are favorable to the corrupt views of the Church of Rome, which are advocated by many persons of distinguished character in the German Reformed Church, and have not been reprimanded by the authorities of the said Church." 
                  The Catholic papers have published a list of the names of distinguished conversions to the Romish Church, which have occurred in this country within the last ten years, stating by the way, that it is not nearly complete. Nineteen Episcopalian Ministers are named among these converts, viz: Revs. J. R. Bayley, Dr. Forbes, Thomas S. Preston, Dr. Huntington, Donald McLeod, Ferdinand E. White, Mr. Richards, Mr. Loutrel, Mr. Burchard, William Everett, Mr. Pollard, and Mr. Stoughton, all of New York! Rev. Dr. L. S. Ives, Bishop of North Carolina; Mr. Shaw, of Alaba- 
                     ma; Mr. Baker, of Baltimore; Mr. Hewitt, of Connecticut; Mr. Hoyt, of Vermont; Mr. Major, of Philadelphia; and Mr. Wadham, of Albany. Protestant Ministers of other denominations-Dr. O. A. Brownson and George Leach of Boston; Prof. Oertel and Porter Thomas, of New York; and Rev. William J. Bakewell, of Pittsburgh, who was the immediate successor of the celebrated Mathew Henry, the great commentator upon the Bible, as pastor of his congregation at Chester, England, if we recollect rightly, afterwards pastor of the Unitarian congregation at Pittsburgh, after that, again, an Episcopalian clergyman, and now a member of the Mother Church. His son, Robert A. Bakewell, editor of the Shepherd of the Valley, is another convert who bids fair by his zeal and talents to rank with the most distinguished of these conquests from Protestantism. 
                  Thirteen officers of the army and six of the navy, are added to the list of the captures taken in the ten years' holy war. The names of the "honorable women, not a few," are withheld from a feeling of propriety; but it is intimated that they are very numerous, and we doubt not that such is the fact. 
                  The Virgin Mary, "Mother of God and Queen of Heaven" inserted into the Catholic Trinity, for obvious reasons, is a very efficient supernumerary force in its divinity; and the ample provision for enthusiasm, made by the Church, is an opening for the devotees of faith and charity, which gives it immense advantages over the more simple and commonplace institutions of Protestantism. These things work according to the laws of human nature, and it requires but little philosophy to perceive the larger and more natural adjustment of the ancient Church to the diverse wants of the wide world than the reformation allows. If there was nothing but the feminine element in the divinity, supplied by the Catholic creed, which the Protestant lacks, the difference must tell decisively; but many another want is met, and urgent necessity of the heart provided for, which must go far to counterbalance the faults of the one side, and the peculiar excellences of the other. Auricular confession; intercession of the saints; pomp and ceremonial impressiveness of public worship; mystic sacredness of the priesthood; efficiency of prayer and sacrifice for the benefit of the dead; antiquity and universality of the church-all have their effect, which suffers but little abatement from the historical offences which she has committed against the rights and liberties of mankind, in a country like this, where her powers for evil are not felt and but little feared. 
                  That Catholicism is on the increase among us at a great rate, is obvious enough. A similar process is going on in England. It requires to be looked into. Providence, we think, intends to call the attention of Protestantism to its own condition by this means. The wisest use and the best that the reformed churches can make of it, will be to occupy themselves less with the faults of the old enemy, and look more sharply to the amendment of their own. Their own goodness will be the best argument they can offer against her abuses. 
                
                
                  REFORMERS. 
                  RELIGION is a necessity of our nature, and worship is the instinct of our noblest faculties, but establishments must answer our uses, or they must perish. In this lies the error of over-strained conservatism: it allows no change of forms, no variation of agencies, and no extension of principles to new requirements, or the correction of old abuses. It dams up the tide of progress in the vain hope of turning it back upon its source. It admits no reformation, and thereby invites revolution. The turbulent waters that cannot be restrained, and should not have been checked, may overpass their proper boundaries and waste something that deserved to live, but the blame rests with the barrier that lifted the waves above their natural level and compelled them into violence. 
                  The reformer has ever a fearful mission to fulfil. As destroyer of the old and builder of the new, he is responsible at once for the good that he finds and the evil he occasions. His reverence for the past and his fears for the future, are alike torturing. He cannot turn his back upon the unburied dead without pain, nor look forward upon the experiment to which he subjects the unborn without misgiving. His surpassing love is returned in hatred, and his devotion is rewarded with death, yet, not his will but the will of heaven must be done. He accepts the shame and suffering of a rejected redeemer, and, for the hope set before him, does his appointed work, though, for the present, it overturns the temple and destroys the State. 
                  It is the mystery of iniquity that the men of every age have killed the prophets and stoned all those that were sent unto them. When worship has been changed into a trade, the priesthood into oppressors, and the temple become a den of thieves; men answer a righteous remonstrance that, "it was forty and six years a-building, and they have Abraham for their father!" and, therefore, stone the preacher of truth for blasphemy! 
                  The Church now, should learn from the fate of those which it has replaced, that God is not bound by a covenant which on its part has been broken, and that men will not continue to reverence an institution which its own corruption has dishonored honored. The cry of heretic, Sabbath-breaker, blasphemer, infidel, pestilent fellow, now, as in the olden time, means nothing if untrue, and has no force if it is not fact. The true religion must be vindicated, the world's highest welfare secured, and whatsoever opposes itself will be destroyed. 
                  We are not of those who would trample down the wheat in weeding out the tares, but we cannot call that the vineyard of the Lord which yields only wild grapes where we look for good ones.-We think that a religion which looks only towards the next world, but does no good and much harm to the present one, is not only a meagre sham but an oppressive evil, and thinking so, we say so; for by its fruits we may judge it. We are authorized to say that men are not of the Lord who do not love their brethren. The charity of almsgiving and the observance of days, do not satisfy us, but the establishment of justice and the reform of evil. God is not mocked, and men are not long deceived. 
                  When profession contributes to social respect and pecuniary profit, it is natural for crime to fly to the altar for sanctuary. It is the popularity of religion that endangers its purity and perverts its influence. Wherever the Church is strong enough in popular respect to denounce hereby with effect, and stamp the man with infamy whom it calls infidel, it is too much of this world to be faithful to it or to the other. Jesus and his apostles denounced the priesthood of their day, but they instructed and persuaded the Sadducees and unbelievers. It was the rich and the great, the hypocrite and the oppressor, not the misguided fanatic or the reckless profligate, that they denounced. And they never appealed to the prejudices of piety, or the fears of conservatism, to silence their opponents. Especially did they not lend their countenance and sanction to the social injustice and individual oppression of the times. They were reformers ers, not Pharisees, and that is the reason why their names were cast out as evil, and themselves crucified, for religion's sake. 
                  Our reformers may not modestly claim too close a resemblance to their character; but their fate is enough like to suggest it, and the position and conduct of bigoted conservatism in our time, may see its own image in the hierarchy of theirs. In zeal for forms and ceremonies, sanctity and severity of ritual worship, missionary spirit, reverence for the word and the temple, scrupulous observance of formal prayer, abhorrence of reformers and unbelievers, almsgiving to the poor, austerity of manners and sectarian controversies, the priests and elders of the Jews were not to be excelled. The Christian Church was not instituted to rival or surpass them in these things. It is the weightier matters of the law-justice, mercy and truth, neglected by them, that are enjoined upon us as our distinguishing duty. And our priesthood must at least lend "so much as one of their fingers" to lift the burdens from the shoulders of the poor and oppressed, if they would justify and maintain their position. Heaven will not tolerate and humanity will not long endure such sad perversion of their functions. Temple and altar have no more sacredness in themselves than tower and fortress. Providential reformations make no account of rituals, sacrifices, and fanes, from which the Divine presence has departed; and the ordinances that are perverted, and the institutions which have lost their beneficence, are swept away as rubbish by the roused retribution of heaven and earth. 
                
                
                   
                  THE INDUCTIVE PHILOSOPHY, A GUIDE IN MATERIALISM-FIRST PRINCIPLES, THE SCIENCE OF LIFE. 
                  RELIGION, if true at all, is central truth, and all other knowledge must gather round it. The low estimation in which it is held, is the reproach of our age. Dr. Beecher once said, that it seemed to him that the Devil held a mortgage upon almost all the men of science and literature of the times. He inferred this, probably, from their indifference to, and ill-concealed contempt for, our technical theology and formal piety. For this they might be excused, but their real ignorance of the highest truth is their essential fault. It is remarkable that the practical attempts at reforming the Reformation in Europe, for half a century were not only anti-ecclesiastical, but anti-religious in sentiment, confounding principles with institutions, which misrepresented them. And it is just as remarkable that the social, moral and societary reforms, which have their date within the last twenty years, in a continually increasing degree, make religious principles their starting point. 
                  The spirit of physical discovery, conversant only with material causes and phenomena, induced a philosophy which, needing no God, made no account of him, and naturally enough tended to disbelief of his existence, or at least, of his spiritual relations to the Creation. Bacon and Baconian philosophers might borrow a religion, but the inductive philosophy itself teaches that providence is only a bundle of principles, and leaves its disciples to guess their way to spiritual truth, if they will, by the  priori route, which its theory discards and its triumphs are understood to discredit. Under the guidance of the mechanical philosophy, society has been led through the wilderness of physics to the verge of its mission. It could conduct the march, but it cannot organize the conquest. Its function ends at the border of the promised land. There the Lord will bury it, like the body of Moses, so that no man may find its grave, to render it a degrading homage. 
                  Moral science, deduced from first principles-a system capable of revealing facts-must replace the science which painfully and blindly gropes its way among effects, and generalizes its partial discoveries into imperfect and discordant theories. It must begin at the centre and work to the circumference. Experience is not its authority. Experience at best casts only our own shadow upon our pathway-moral science must direct its discoveries by the sunlight streaming in upon every step of its progress. The nature, not the history-the faculties and origin of man, not his conditions, are the first questions in the process required. And the nature of his Creator is the true directory to these. The analysis of a thousand rills is neither so direct nor so true as an equivalent knowledge of the fountain. At every departure disturbing elements are added, and accidental modifications interfere and confuse. 
                  Society must correspond to the thought of God before it can harmonize with the physical conditions of its habitation. There can be no end to the war between men, between nature and men, between God and man, till humanity is ordered and organized upon the Divine ideal. Begin there, then, and thence project your thought toward realization of the truth and the right. The candle which you kindle in the dark, deepens the blackness of all that lies beyond its little circle, but the sunbeams illumine at once the heavens and the earth. Your tower of bricks cannot be built up to the heavens; the discords of the builders would prevent, even if the earth afforded sufficient material and its inhabitants had the strength; but, with one sweep of the eye the fixed stars can be seen in their own light. 
                  It is as striking as it is true that spiritualism and faith in immortality, are the distinction of barbarism, while our civilization doubts, if it does not deny, the existence of "angel and spirit." The Romans while they measured time by the sun-dial, and fought with the sword and battering ram, deified their heroes and raised altars to their departed relatives; our own aborigines buried their dead in the sitting posture, and supplied them with the implements and weapons required in the happy hunting grounds. The inductive philosophy had not barred the all-pervading life out of their universe, and spiritualism had not perished under the judgment of the exact sciences. 
                  Men must recover the primitive truth, and consult their Maker if they would fulfil their destiny and avail themselves of his omniscience and omnipotence in achieving it. 
                  Social science-humanity-is the problem of the age. It must be solved in the light of divine truth. The efficiency of supreme principles is required for integral reform. A religion of forms, a religion of sacrifice and negations, is behind the age; the times demand a religion of adaptation and of uses-a natural, a true religion. 
                
                
                  METHODS AND MEASURES OF RELIGIOUS REVIVALS. 
                  THIS afternoon at three o'clock, in Dr. Durbin's church, Eighth street, above Race, there is to be a meeting of the clergy and laity of the city, to take into consideration the best mode of evangelizing the community-to adopt some plan of operations which, haply, may secure greater conformity of Christians, nominal and real, to the requirements of our holy religion. We do know that it is intended to devise any system of revivals, technically so called, nor do we suppose that this is the principal, if any part of the purpose which calls the meeting together. A general agreement on this point among the clergy and people of all denominations could not be expected, and would not be asked, but it is, we suppose and hope, a revival of that godliness which has the promise both of the life that now is and that which is to come. 
                  The other revival system has done it best, and is confessedly inadequate to the wants of society for any purpose, either of religious sentiment or of moral practice. This Convention is itself a confession of failure to achieve the evangelical reformation of society by protracted meetings. Just as the temperance excitement, which once promised to accomplish a universal reform of the community, but with all its toils and triumphs is now at least stationary, so the revival measures of ten years ago, have fallen lamentably short of their expected universality and permanency. These enterprises are both of unquestionable excellence in principle and purpose, but they fail even of their own high aim, much more, of the great collateral good expected from them, because neither of them embrace all the conditions required to meet the mischiefs they are intended to antagonize. 
                  The religious and moral sentiments are indeed the natural governing powers of the mind, but they must govern according to its entire constitution if they would steadily maintain their sovereignty. There are numerous insurgent impulses which cannot long be kept in submissive inactivity. The Church must be organized, and ordered so as to give due indulgence to these, while it demands their due restraint. Nothing short of some system which will make our bread and water sure, educate and employ our whole mental nature, provide for, and satisfy, all our sentiments and affections, and put the entire man in harmony with himself, with his neighbor, and his Creator, at once, will prove a perfect religion for humanity. The whole life cannot get room and activity in worship alone, nor can the animal, sensitive and social powers, long be held suspended by the highest sentiment of religious devotion. The church must turn its regards steadily to the laws and necessities of our lower nature, and elevate, harmonize and sanctify it thoroughly, through the agency of adjusted physical and social conditions, before it can achieve the millenium, or even approach it. We look with interest upon every indication of reform, and every confession of incompetency in existing methods. Good must come of them.

                  SCIENTIFIC SCEPTICISM SNUBBED. 
                  (A PRIVATE LETTER SURREPTITIOUSLY PUBLISHED.) 
                   
                     [For the Una.] 
                     MADAM-In your second number you say that "the best things ever written are unpublished letters." I happen to have one to spare. For very obvious reasons I suppress the address. I have even altered the initial letter to escape the application. 
                     
                        D.
                      
                   
                   
                     
                        PHILADELPHIA, August 1st, 1852.
                      
                     My Dear D.-What a dismally dignified distress you have put yourself into about the deplorable delusions which have come upon the age! Don't fret yourself. Your philosophy losophy has nothing in it that entitles it to treat our superstition with contempt. It behaves just now as if it had used up all the logic in the language to cover its own nakedness, and had left itself nothing but hard words to throw at the impertinent opinions which challenge its shabby pretensions. "Swedenborg, Mesmer, Joe Smith, Jackson Davis, Miss Fox, Fourier, Spurzheim, and the rest of the Tom-fool family humbugs!" Why, one would think you had learned your Latin in the fish-market! You may treat yourself to the comfort of feeling that your Hunker College diploma authorizes all this superciliousness, but the democratic audacity of the times cares very little for the fastidiousness of the school of forlorn fogies. When a boy holds off and only makes mouths at a bully, it is understood that he considers his beauty, as much as his dignity, in danger. I am candidly of opinion that the regulars will gain no honors in the ring with these rowdies in literature, faith and philosophy. They are a rugged lot of left-handed hard-hitters, and the dandy scientifics are dead sure of a black eye in every encounter. It is a free fight, my dear fellow, and if you are not sure of your weapons, and confident of your luck, take a friend's advice and keep in the shade. Hunkerism has no choice left to it but submission or a drubbing. If you have no stomach for either, take care that you don't coax the catastrophe upon your devoted head. The old school tacticians of Europe complained bitterly that Napoleon not only beat them out of their boots, but that he violated all the established rules of warfare in the doing of it. That didn't alter the result however. Complaints and explanations won't restore a battle after it is lost. "Take physic, Pomp, or take care of yourself."-Shakspeare. 
                     You are right in the fact, but you are not right in your complaint, that the age of marvels has returned upon the world. Within the last century we have a revival of supernaturalism, just because the thing was in itself inevitable, or in the philosophical sense of the word, necessary; and I take leave to say that it was necessary in every good meaning of the term. In whatever form it comes, thank Providence that the undivine dynasty of reason, which has the credit of overthrowing the superstitions of the middle ages, is encountering a subtler foe in the spiritualism of the present day. Magic, witchcraft, necromancy, with oracles, angels, and all the forms of immediate revelation, went down under the mechanical philosophy and the severely incredulous spirit of protestantism. The reformed religion, with even more potency than the exact sciences, addressed itself to the task of disenchanting the earth of its spiritual machinery, and blotting out the myriad intermediate agencies which personated the Divine Providence in the Gentile, Jewish, and early Christian creeds. The 30,000 Gods of Greece, the multitude in the Pantheon of Rome, the spiritual hierarchy of the East, and the ruder and simpler mythology of the North and West of Europe, were all discredited by the new faith, and the government of the world fell under the jurisdiction of uniform laws, whose mysteries mathematics alone can unlock; and, interpositions, if allowed at all, are reserved for the direct and immediate personal attention of the Supreme Being himself, who is at the same time held to be unchangeable and without shadow of turning in all his ways. 
                     Our religion is as rigid as rationalism itself in excluding miracles and accommodation from the affairs of the present life; and the people and powers of the supernatural world are swept away as corruptions of faith, and occasions of sin. The invocation of the saints is denounced, and even the ministry of angels, on the ground that it savors too much of Paganism, is permitted to remain only as an occult tenet of speculative theology, but denied any ascertained Authority or practical force in the creed of the Reformation. All the assumptions of natural religion, all the fond inventions of the human heart, have fallen under the law, and our relations with the dead of our households are forbidden to traverse the barrier of their graves. We may pray for the dying till the last pulse has ceased at the heart, and the last film settled on the eye, but on the instant that the unconscious subject has escaped its clay, a wish for his welfare becomes a presumptuous sin! The societies of the heavens and the earth are divorced, for all the purposes of real intercommunication, and the celestial hierarchy is utterly stripped of its old-time office of superintending the destinies of men and nations. 
                     Such a bare-boned materialism as this cannot expect to hold the live warm heart of humanity in its skeleton gripe forever. A grain of wheat will live for a century in the ice, the germ of a rose will creep round a stone and pierce the hardest baked clay that crushes it; for life will and must deliver itself from the clutches of the insensate lump. It was natural enough that the hard-fisted philosophy of physical facts should thus overshadow the faith of fancy and intuition, while engaged in its great conflict with the insurgent forces of the material creation. Mind ebbs and flows like the sea. While the revolutions of the globe continue, high tide in one quarter drains the shores in another. Before the rise of the inductive philosophy, matter was thought to be vitalized in every atom by intelligent agents, directed by presiding spirits, malignant or benign, in a way that entirely subverted the method of law, and took away all reliance, upon the constancy of nature's phenomena. Bacon and Luther reduced it all to clock-work, wound up to go, between attraction and repulsion, till it runs down and is taken in hand by the Maker for repairs. 
                     In this, reformed Christianity is fundamentally distinguished from Paganism, from the religion of nature, and from the spontaneous theology of the passions and of poetry. The Jupiter of Greece and Rome was not confounded with the Supreme Being. Their primal divinity was neither born, made, defined nor known. The Gods whom they directly worshipped were either portions and emanations of the Eternal essence, or departed spirits of heroes and illustrious men, exalted to celestial offices, and invested with the government of nature. The absolute Supreme sustained and controlled the universe, but the subordinate functionaries exercised the liberties and discretion of a delegated administration. There was large margin left for the free play of motives in the agents, and of influence upon them. This is what was meant by the belief that the Gods ruled in the heavens and the earth, but were themselves limited by the fates. 
                     The theoretical system of the New Testament is not so wholly unlike this doctrine as totally to discredit it. The Father is as unsearchable and as distant in our creed as in theirs, and our man-maker, world-creator and vicegerent divinity, is so far human that "he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities," and disposed to modify and accommodate the system of existence to our necessities. While he sojourned in the flesh, the laws of nature were every day subjected to the impulses of a temporary benevolence, and he gave a like dominion over them to his disciples. His life was a constant demonstration of PROVIDENCE OVERRULING MATERIALISM. Not a book, not a chapter, of our Bible but teaches the same doctrine and encourages its confidence. Prayer supposes it, religion assumes it; if it is not true, we are "without God and without hope in the world." If the Old Testament is in any respect obsolete, it is nevertheless historical evidence; but the New leaves no doubt, and requires no support. In the book called the Acts of the Apostles, angels are as numerous and as essential to the action of the story as the human agents themselves; and in the narratives of the Evangelists, their interventions mark every crisis, and mingle in every movement, of the wonderful history. 
                     Pray tell me, my good friend, are you a Christian, or are you a philosopher? If you don't like either horn of the dilemma, and prefer that neutralized composition of contradictions called a "Christian philosopher," be frank and give me the anatomy of the creature. I want to understand it. 
                     The contempt which you entertain for what you are pleased to call superstition, is in effect an insolent assault upon the holiest and most necessary of faiths; and you may rest assured that the instincts of the soul will not meanly surrender to the sneers of science. Why, man alive, that matter which you think so respectable a fixed fact, is, according to your own showing, inert-dead as a door nail; and the laws, those convenient resources of your impudence, what are they but the rules by which intelligence carries on the system of being? Rules or laws are not powers or forces; they are but methods in which power, properly so called, operates itself. And how do you know that the process of existence is not carried on by a regency, a hierarchy, of living intelligences, a committee of the whole on the state of the Universe? Take that curl out of your lip, and answer for yourself. 
                     You see, I don't consider myself in your debt for any particular politeness. Any man that says Swedenborg, Fourier, Spurzheim and humbug, to me, must ask forgiveness before it would be of any use to him. It would be absolutely profane to speak so of Bacon, Newton, and Columbus; yet they were but children in knowledge and achievement to those men whom you revile. Moses and the Prophets, Jesus and the Apostles, are not of your party; Shakspeare is the only real immortal name in your calendar, and you cannot claim him by any real affinity of faith or feeling. Behave yourself; you may as well, for the flood of time is going to wash the world clean of your stupid style of orthodoxy. 
                     You miserable mummy! there is life, whether you know it or not, in the light and heat of the sun; there is spirit in the air which feeds the living creation. Everything alive within us denies the Sadducean philosophy. Nothing in the universe is dead; no movement in the creation is merely mechanical. Life cannot fellowship with death. We call the vitality of zinc and copper electricity, but it is the metallic passion, and it touches our nerves like their own fire. Tut, man, even a sherry cobbler might soften your clay into sense, though college-baked to a brick-bat. 
                     The spiritual agency which the world's instincts hold by inheritance from nature, and which all religions consecrate, is an easy translation of experience out of the known into the unknown sphere of existence. The human family is one; its individuals are all members of one another; the dependencies and reciprocities of our natural life indicate and assure the relations which must subsist between all the realms of rational existence, and "philosophy, falsely so called," cannot finally wrench us away from our union with the worlds above us, and from actual communion with their saints-with David, Daniel and Mary, with Pythagoras, Matthew and Paul; with the spirits which inspired the classic oracles, the sibyls of barbarous Rome, and the Druids of our ancestors. The sages and the little children of all ages, though they could neither state the theory nor defend it, all alike accepted and rested in it, and all for the same reason, that it is the truth of nature, and necessary to the truth of every hope and trust of the human soul. What headway or resistance can logic make against a universal intuition? 
                     Superstition! The word is evidently from the Latin SUPERSTES, those, who stand up or survive after the battle of life. The Romans built altars to their dead; they kept their places open in the domestic circle; they held them fast in the arms of affection, and insisted upon an unbroken intercourse with their loved ones disembodied; and the immortality of the soul was accordingly as clear to them and as positive, as to our North American savages, who yielded not so much to death as to lie down in their graves in submission, but were buried in the sitting posture, with their faces to the sunrise, and their parched corn and implements of the chase ready for the happy hunting grounds at the call of the Great Spirit! There are facts for you, with a meaning in them; and testimony enough to prove them. 
                     Philosophy, indeed! with nothing but its capital of doubts to boast, and nothing but the logic of negation to defend them! I tell you it is destined to change places in the world's judgment (when it gets wiser and better), with the faith which it scorns, and to receive the just retribution of contempt for its empty pride. The inductive system of speculative philosophy was a born infidel to all spirituality, its devotion a shallow hypocrisy, its baptism a presumptuous imposture. We are afloat, sir, afloat; our sails filled with the breath of heaven; our intuitions, touched and kindled with the true polar attraction, point steadily to the star of hope, and we have the chart of inspiration for our guide on the voyage. All's well; but if you like your anchorage in the mud, if you prefer your fog-bank to our sunshine, turn into your bunk, and don't bother us with your dismal unbelief in the science of navigation. Some of our light craft may be wrecked, but you, you miserable hulk, you will do nothing but rot. Our recourse is good upon the underwriter, but you have no insurance. 
                     I know nothing by observation of Davis's revelations, nor of the Miss Fox's table tippings and spirit rappings, and, in fact, I care nothing about them. Whosoever believes has the witness in himself of all that concerns him; he knows as much as he can receive. It is for such forlornities as you who doubt everything, and then doubt your doubts, to require knocking, tilting and kicking into a belief. Judge, by your contempt of these, how respectable is the kind of demonstration, which you and your school require for everything. Here you have it peddled up and down the country at twenty-five cents a ticket, children half price. Much good may it do you. There is nothing more amusing to me than to see an elephant faint because the company is not select. Why don't you tear down the canvas and expose the show-that would take all the wonder out of it. Oh, fy, fy! You that know so much about, and believe so much in, facts, are all the time complaining that they trick you! Aren't you ashamed! The fight is all in your own field, and you must stand up to it or pull down your colors. 
                     Spurzheim would convince you, Fourier would convert you, Swedenborg would make you all over new. If you cannot stand that, keep out of their reach and call them humbugs, but don't indulge your temper upon the rappings. My dear fellow, they are-why they are-bona fide physical phenomena! don't treat them with contempt, or Lord Bacon will be down like the judgment day upon you. You must not countenance locomotives and telegraphs, if you turn up your nose at these. If I thought you had the heart to be grateful for the favor, I believe I would pity you; but, for the sake of the best possible adjustment to the case I believe I will laugh at you. 
                     I am beginning to think you relish the works of Milton because he wrote Paradise Lost. Your dislike of the works of the Mormons who are bravely endeavoring to achieve a paradise regained, looks like it. Poor fellow; how you will suffer if the world don't stop. The child is sea-sick and the ship won't anchor in the middle of the ocean! If all the world were dead, how nicely you could keep tavern. Did you ever think of that? It is a chance, don't despair. 
                     
                        Very Respectfully, 
                        W. E.
                      
                   
                
                
                  JUDGE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT. 
                  THERE must be a philosophy of Humbug, and it ought to be understood. It certainly has facts, and probably principles, enough, to entitle it to a place among the sciences. There is nothing in their moral character or practical utility which entitles them to be very shy of the association. The difficulty lies in effecting the required harmony between the lies and truths of the system. Men of gross, lumping views, and those who are fastidiously impatient of imposture, are equally incapable of rightly comprehending it. 
                  All inconsistencies are not hypocrisy, and even decided immoralities are not wholly incompatible with the truth of high professions. We once knew a man who was religious in the exact proportion that he was drunk; and we have seen several sober ones whose sentiments were very high and very earnest too, who were, nevertheless, very imperfect men. 
                  How much of the scamp may be safely mixed up with general good qualities, and leave the man a tolerable share of integrity, is a nice question; and what particular sins and infirmities can consist with a good conscience, is not easily determined. Character has not yet been worked into an exact science, for the reason, chiefly, it seems to us, that owing to prejudices, varying standards, and other disturbing influences, rogues have not been thoroughly and fairly studied and classified. Even Shakspeare managed fools and madmen something better than he did villains, because, doubtless, even he understood intellect better than passion. 
                  It is a striking fact that there is no work extant, which deals with human character, its vices and follies, so kindly and considerately as the Bible. And who can doubt that it is as just as it is generous in its judgments? Abraham fibbed about his wife; Isaac did the same thing: Jacob cheated his father, his brother, and his father-in-law; Moses slew an Egyptian unlawfully; Samson was in the worst company he could find in the city of Gaza, the night before he escaped by carrying off the gates; David's sin, for which he suffered the loss of Bathsheba's child, was a sad lurch from propriety; and Solomon ruined his kingdom by his idolatries and licentiousness. 
                  How tenderly the good book treats the offender while it condemns the offence! Even the New Testament is not without examples of similar morality is perfect, and its how patient its authorities forbearance to delinquents. Its judgments not equivocal; yet, are with the infirmities of human nature! The book of Acts, and the epistles of Paul, Peter and John, report the conduct, and portray the character or the earliest disciples and churches in a way that nothing thing less than a system absolutely safe in its own excellency could endure. 
                  The inference is, that the highest and truest view of human character is infinitely more merciful than those partial judgments which we ordinarily pass upon the offences which we are not in the circumstances to commit, or, in the conditions safely to allow. 
                  There stands the law-"Love thy neighbor as thyself"-"Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before thy God"-wholly unaffected by all the moral delinquencies which the book so frankly records of its heroes and pattern saints. Human societies are obliged, more or less, to maintain their order, both by force of civil law and controlling opinion, but there is a lesson of moderation in all this, as obvious and imperative as the standard of perfect righteousness which is at the same time to be maintained. 
                  It is clear that the examples of the Patriarchs and Prophets do not release us from the requirements of the higher morality which their precepts enjoin; and it is equally clear that the most stringent application of the law to the conduct and character of individual men, is not warranted by the standard of Christian faith, nor by the rules of true philosophy. 
                  The heretical Samaritan whom Jesus approved-the woman whom he declined condemning, but enjoined to reform-and the young man whom he loved, notwithstanding his slavish love of wealth, are cases, with authority, to make us pause before we conclude that every great fault, either in faith or practice, taints the whole man. 
                
                
                   
                  INTEMPERANCE. 
                  THE whole revenue of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, for the year 1851, amounted to fifty-six millions of pounds sterling. Of this sum thirteen and a half millions were raised by the excises upon spirituous liquors and malt, and four and a half millions upon tobacco. Eighteen millions of pounds sterling tax, for one year, upon the narcotic stimulants consumed by the European subjects of Queen Victoria! 
                  The land tax of England, Wales and Scotland was but a little over a million for the same year, and the income tax but five and a half. Add to these the assessed taxes (2,647,078) and we have but nine and a quarter millions from the property of the kingdom, against eighteen millions for the substances used for the purposes of intoxicating stimulation. Verily, the temperance reformation has a formidable foe to confront, in the customs and interests which it opposes! 
                  It seems to us that the causes of, or necessity for, this indulgence, have not yet been adequately apprehended. Physiologists speak of the stimuli of life-air, light, warmth, the excitement of the senses, and of the emotions. These are put down by them as so many necessary excitants of vital activity. Food, also, is not more a nutriment than a stimulant of the functions, and the artificial stimulation by narcotics, which everywhere and always holds a place among the usages, if it does not belong to the actual wants of human existence, has some relation to life, which demands investigation and settlement, more thorough and certain than it has yet received. 
                  A cup of coffee and a savory beef-steak produce their cordial effects upon the system long before they have been assimilated; and it is clear in experience that it is not only in the nutricious properties of our aliment that its reviving and sustaining power resides. Life and health may, most unquestionably, be best supported by food and drinks which never intoxicate; but there is, nevertheless, something in pure and unmixed stimulation very nearly allied to the normal excitation of the senses and feelings, by such legitimate means as music, beauty of forms and colors, and the luxuries of exalted emotion. 
                  The ordinary life of most people is so poor and meagre that it is not wonderful that they resort to the pleasant delirium of intoxication for enjoyment. The remedy by total abstinence does not supply the want that preys upon heart and mind. The true remedy, and the sure one, is to be found only in the satisfaction of all the craving faculties. The Apostle seems to aim at this idea when he says-"be ye not drunk with wine, but be filled with the spirit"-as if he had said, cultivate and employ the highest relishes of soul and sense, and the coarser enjoyments of appetite will have no power to tempt. 
                  Nevertheless, self-denial is the law of life until its highest and happiest conditions are attained. 
                
                
                   
                  SPIRIT RAPPINGS. 
                  NECROMANCY is as old as the Witch of Endor. The Bible does not deny the fact; it affirms it and prohibits the practice. No revelation treats sorcery, divination, witchcraft and consultations with the dead as humbugs; no revelation can do so, for it commissions spirits, answers to invocations, employs apparitions, and shows signs and wonders, for its own purposes; and so assumes their truth and reality. This much endorsement any superstition may claim from the authority that the world accepts; but soothsayers, sorcerers and necromancers, must take the prohibition along with the concession. The corresponding intervention of good spirits and authorized ministries is also displayed along side and close-linked with the evil agencies. Moses was closely imitated by the Magicians of Egypt. Beelzebub had the credit of exorcising demons, at the same time that the disciples were casting them out. Jesus, when he gave the miracle-working power to his disciples, warned them that false prophets should arise and show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect. St. Paul tells the Thessalonians of "that wicked one whose coming is after the power of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie." 
                  The Gods celestial and infernal of the Pagan world correspond to these good and evil agents of our own system; and the universal agreement of all times and countries concerning such antagonism between "Michael and his angels, and the Dragon and his angels," is not to be disposed of except by the total denial of both. 
                  If there is anything of fact in the moving of tables and such-like physical phenomena, that falls within the domain of science, scientific let it be, and let observation and experiment settle it. It proves nothing for the truth or worth of any spiritual communication which is supposed to come along with it. St. Paul, who certainly had neither doubt of, nor contempt for, miracles, speaks of a faith, apparently a true faith, capable of removing mountains, yet without charity; and its possessor, in his judgment, is a nothing. 
                  "The light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" is surely a better guide for faith and practice than any shadow that a "circle" can conjure up from the grave; and any religion of civilized men is more likely to have the inspiration of the Most High, the Father of all Spirits, in it, than the chatterings of some stray ghost that has nothing better to do than gossip with such modern mediums as the average of those who have this business in hand. 
                  We neither quarrel with any man nor despise him for lacking a religion, or for wanting one so badly as to expect it to come down to him through a mesmerized spout: but we hold that good taste is a sort of religion which should be respected. Where there is a great deal of wonder there is that much less wisdom, generally; and we recommend a little quietness, caution and waiting. Let an opinion be shipshape before it goes off on a missionary voyage. It is a shabby show that nobody can see. The excessive admiration which this thing has received reminds us of the childishness (without the grace and beauty) of the little fellow's prayer, who had been to see a magic exhibition. "Dear Dod," said the child, "did you ever see Signor Blitz? If you didn't I want you to go!" 
                
             
            THE END.
