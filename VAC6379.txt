EVERY THNG FOR ALL (that can get it), that'p our Uncle Sam's motto; but how is said ALL to get it, if any body's got any right to keep any thing back that any body else wants? It's clearly a conspiracy against the peace and dignity of 11 his "FREE AND ENLIGHTENED," for when people want a thing, they want it; trust a traitor to put his own papers in apple-pie order, and see     8      PREAMBILAR PERORATION. if he don't slip out, or burn up the very ones you want: and, besides, what good will it do a man going on a trip to-day, if Mr. Dick and the missing papers should turn up to-morrow? W on't he have to be picked up next da, and acquit the engine on the morrow? Of course he will, and the fact is, he ought to have had these, and more besides, long ago; and would, too, if our su- perfluous, but well-meaning, hard-working Master Mel' hadn't been intercepted, and somewhat crippled, by the senseless kickings and cavortings of one of those old : "bdggars on horseback," that never can be easy to ride on their way, witho:r; iding down every' thing else. However, he'll find the ingenious operation of "biting off his own nose to spite his face," pleasant and profit- able, perhaps, some day; and the unlucky ad inter, with his gallant, but ill-omened name, has rotated now, and we've taken abundant precautions that there's to be . ' no more of that." Miss BETSEY may chafe at having  to buy another new veil, but knows very well we've got all her records in such "a fix," that nobody else ever could decipher ten consecutive words; a simple and effi-  cacious plan for "holding on," that we should take  great pleasure in recommending to other secretaries and office-holders, only that most of them, it is believed, practise upon it already. True, it has this little incon-  venience, we can't always make it out ourselves; and  when one line's contumacious, another has to go down.  This rather amalgamates styles; and one of the parties ..: being forestalled in his designs, may take advantage of it, to pretend our version isn't genuine ; but if any body  doubts it, let him come and see if we haven't got his   ......... 9rJJ Ja: IuATION.    9 first drafts, and others, too, belonging apparently to no particular person or place, but evidently smuggled in by some supernumerary scion, or candidate on trial. It is extremely mortifying, though, that we can't tell all inquiring minds a great deal more about our clief's private history than she knows herself she never did like being catechised, you knqw, but from all that we can learn, worthy Mr. Micawher, with a disinterest- edness above all praise, directed her attention to this continent about the time of the last presidential elec- tion, and persuaded her to be on hand in case "any thing should turn up." Accordingly, we find her here soon after all Bonnetdom went "a-crabbing ; "and it was hoped, the sight of her " respectable bever  ight arrest its course before it goack to Mrs. Eve's fig-leaf; but, unfortunately, a due regard for personal safety, and great horror of having to set her clogs in every predecessor's footsteps, compelled her, not only to muffle it in a double veil of deep-blue mystery, but even forego b ts "insane tilt," and her own patronymic, in order to escape being torn limb from limb by those peer- less jackals, apes, and other ' varmints," always on the look-out for some foreign lion! The election--mch to " glorification" discomfiture turned up FRANK PIERCE; and much to the credit of his sagacity, and Mr. Micawher's forecast, Mss BET- SY's unique talents were soon put in requisition. Fortunately, the official duties chimed in admirably with her own inclination to see what nobody else goes to see, and knowing that thimngs are to names as nothing to me, she continues up to this very day passing up and     10      PREXMBILAR PERORATION. down (for the most part very quietly), under her ob- scure cognate; catching morals and manners without their holiday hats and "Sabba-dy" cloaks on, " takin' notes," and dispensing meed and dreed, "all fearlessly and free," where the first inkling of her distinguished name would bring whole troops of Philistines, if not Bar- num's show-case, down upon her to " put her through" the grand paces, as they did Samson of old; bury her ' five-fathom deep" in hoodwink and "flummery," her especial abomination; and, what is worse, deprive  Mrs. Grundy, " and all the rest of mankind," of the great pleasure of knowing what she really does think of the "chief estates" and little-greats in Uncle Sam's and St. Picayune's guessing, gasing, reeling, scrambling, nomadic, stampeding jurisdictions.

REPORT Of the sef-installed Committee of THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHLAN- THROPY-EXPOETATION SOCIETY, prospectively convened, to take into consideration the spirit-stirring humanity appeal of the Ladies of Great Britain to the Ladies of America: MOST ELEVATED TRANSCENDENTALS: Your Committee having met, according to appoint- ment, in the Hall of Imagination, resolved itself into the most fitting exponent of super-empyrean benevo- lence, and agreed that our benevolence always intensi- fies most and flourishes best when its object is in any "- body's reach but our own, did proceed to resolve as follows : First-That whereas, facts and figures do materially impede the march of Transcendental Progress, it is here- by RESOLVED to disclaim, repudiate, and refuse to recog- nize as belonging to the human species, any specimen of the genus homo who shall decline to aid and abet, to the extent of his ability, in dethroning Statistics, Official Investigations, Parliamentary Reports and Scien- tific Demonstrations from their usurped supremacy over the mind of man; and install in their place the very reliable lucubrations of that profoundly erudite, incon- testably matter-of-fact and  pre-eminently veracious class of historians, commonly known as novelists or romancers. Second-That in consideration of the important services rendered by these disinterested though ill-used evangelists of "Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality," it is RESOLVED to request and advise all publishers to issue     16 i      FAMLY pAPERS AND  their works hereafter, not from "love of filthy lucre," but "' free gratis," for the good of the race: and other sympathy-mongers to combine and endow a 6ollege of  criticism, with a capital of fifty millions, and authority to award premiumns of from five to fifty thousand per annum, to the more meritorious of these High Priests  of Utopian Theology.                  ' Third-Be it also RESOLVED, That your commander- in-chief for the Home Department be instructed to de- spatch suitable officers into the Interior, with orders to make full and impartial investigation into all the griev- ances, moral and physical, said to exist not only in the obscure streets, dens, lanes and alleys of the populous cities, but also in the mining, anufacturing, and agri- cultural districts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the adjacent Province of France, and suggest the most expeditious mode of redressing the same; and the Sec- retary for Foreign Affairs authorized and otherwise em- powered to invite the distinguished Charles Dickens and Eugene Sue to lecture iour humane and intelligent coun- trymen on the enormities perpetrated, without their privity or concurrence, in the Schools, Factories, Work- houses, Hospitals, garrets and cellars of Paris and Lon- don, End designate such of our eminent citizens as are, in their opinion, the most proper persons to interfere promptly and efficiently in the premises. Fourth--Being seriously apprehensive that a certain .. ultramundane region denominated Herschel is miserably deficient in light if not heat, this Coloinittee do most unhesitatingly RESOLVE to pettiiow Congress immediately : for a grant of five hundred millions to erect and furnish   US'J'1UkJLAi U SJU DU . lJl -I1JD.

Fifth-Having observed with extreme pleasure the affectionate interest which enlightened denizens of our Territory of Great Britain evince in all our domestic concerns, this Committee do unanimously RESOLVE that the said Territory is now worthy to be, and hereby is, elevated by brevet, to the rank and dignity of a Sove- reign Independent State, with all the rights, privileges, and immunities, present and prospective, appertaining to any other member, oriental or occidental, now, or hereafter to be admitted into this grand confederacy; in ratification whereof this Committee tenders in behalf of society, the right hand of fellowship and fraterniza- tion to the right honorable and well-beloved transatlantic sisters and, confreres, so nobly ambitious of competing with us the honor of re-organizing the whole social and material system. And, finally-Be it resolved that this Committee do now adjourn, repair to the Pantheon of all Abstractions,     18 -FAMLY PAPERS AND submit these resolutions, and ask to be discharged from further service. FANCY TOPLOFTICAL, Chairman. The foregoing Resolutions having been duly present- ed and passed by acclamation-the House previously resolving itself into Committe of the Whole for their reception-it was further RESOLVED, 1st, That the Com- mittee be discharged with many thanks for its prompt and harmonious action, and very able and lucid exposi- ' tion of the precise views and objects of this Society; and, 2d, That copies of these and the aforesaid resolu- tions be immediately transmitted to agents and coadju- tors in all parts of our jurisdiction; and the Pulpit and Press, without distinction of sect or party, be invited and required, under penalty of our displeasure, to give them and the principles therein so luminously embodied,  all the sanction, advocacy, and dissemination which their own intrinsic merit, and the exigency of the case, so im- periously demand.

Here's WOMAN now, once it meant a companion "meet" for man, when man was made in the image of his Maker; now, a poor vulgar creature made (for other people's convenience) out of the refuse clay, unfit for the crystal and china wares of creation. Then, when this " woman" was lawfully married, she was the wife of her husband. "And isn't she now, pray?" Not a bit of it, sir! She's nothing in the world but his lady; that is, some sort of feminine appendage-it may be his sister, his neighbor, his cousin, or it may be something else, not altpgether so presentable; so you'd better keep your eyes open, and make your own inferences-I can't help you, though it's evidently some incumbrance between him and the rest of the baggage. And LADY, too ;-old writers tell us it comes from lafdy, a contraction of laf, a loaf, and day, which signi- fied a loaf-giver; that is, a domestic sort of personage rather given to benevolence and hospitality. Now, it means a bundle of intense selfishness done up in "a mighty void of sense," and moulded by fashion into a walking advertisement of more millinery, gewgaws, and other dry goods-no matter whose or how come by- than any small craft could make good sail ,under, if she !.A     28       FAMLY PAPERS AND hadn't shipped more airs than would float a balloon. And then GENTLEMAN! Time was when that meant "a man without fear and without reproach," now it means-shades of all the Bayards, what does it mean? Well I don't wish to be too critical, and the EInglish certainly is a strong language and a copious, but it strikes me it can't quite come up to that defi- nition!          i  Here Miss Betsey-you've heard of my aunt BET- SEY TROTWOOD, the new CENSOR, haven't you?-gave an "insane tilt" of her beaver at my bundle of rods and fainted, just as one ofthe new specimens bawled out the name of another changeling, CHARITY, in excuse for fagging a young girl to death, whose father he had swindled out of his last dollar, and into a drunkard's grave. I know it's no manner of use this " tickling a r7zi- nocerous with straws," and have my doubts about the propriety of casting "pearls before swine ;" but sup- pose I must do her bidding, or be reformed out of office, and lose all the reward of my uncommon filial piety ; so, do you know, sir, that of two inspired apostles, one gives the definition of that word synthetically and senten- tiously as LOVE, and the other goes into the analysis more elaborately? Of course you don't, and it's a won- der to me that some enterprising colporteur, or getter- up of pious young story-books for grown-up old children, don't think of interspersing a few texts of Scripture in the Price Current, for the benefit of those who never read any thing else; but neither of them ever dreams of confounding it with throwing ("by order of the   ,- d@.    OFFICIAL 'DOCUMENTS.      29 board") a dog's bone with a dog's treatment, at some audacious wretch who brings his misery "between the wind and your nobility," and then chanting loud paeans to your own munificence, and caustic invectives on his ingratitude. Ingratitude, indeed! And what for should he be grateful? That you have pelted off a nuisance with dirty coppers and more bitter words, more to relieve your own eyes than his necessities? Don't he know, as well as you, how easily you can poke your hands into ' your own pockets, say, "so many appeals to charity," and "pass over on the other side," when they are only reported to you? To be sure he does; and don't he know, too, that this very " so many," is generally proof fositive that you never respond to any? None better; and here you swell up, as if the world never saw the like of such magnanimity, because you take in an orphan child, as well if not better born than your i own, and their equal, or superior, it may be, in every thing but present position; or (when you can't help it) patronize in some sort an unfortunate acquaintance, that you were once proud, perhaps, in your very heart's core, to call your "friend," make her the bond slave of all your wills, exact ever after the labor of a Hercules, the patience of Job, the meekness of Moses, the devotion of a martyr, the love of a seraph, and the servility of a toady; and then feel amazed beyond measure if she isn't willing, ever after, to go to perdition, if necessary, to save you and yours from " dying of a rose in aromatic pain." MONSTROUS, isn't it, this "black ingratitude of     1-i 30       FAMLY PAPERS AND human nature" (certes if it exists), and altogether inex- plicable? Not quite! Did you never reflect, that "man is of three natures, reguiring all for charity," that no one feels specially thankful for what he has paid for, over and overt and that this very proscribed ingrate feels in his secret soul that you have taken your pay drop by drop out of his heart's blood to the very last farthing, and ten times over, in the pleasure of trampling down, in your coldness, your passion or your pride, all the in- dependence of his nature-scoffing, sneering, deriding and ignoring all the finer feelings of his being? And he has paid you, for "a man's self-respect is worth more to him than money, and evil is the charity that hum- bleth and maketh man less happy!" Once I saw a lady engage some domestic "finery," and wear it too, despite her own excellent taste, lest the ingenious manufacturer should consider the purchase a mere pretext for bestowing a few dollars which she herself but ill could spare ; and that was charity, but yours-go to, you don't even understand its first princi- ples, never take the word in your mouth again till you know what it means! You have not given "to diligence as to an equal," and the extorted pittance is deadly aconite to the soul!

There's WOMAN'S SPHERE, now as much taller in the way of dubiousness, as metaphys- ics is head and shoulders over mathematics. Why, I tell you, man, it could give odds, carry weight and beat all hollow, at the very first clip, any other will-o'-wisp ever seen this side Adam's fall!  Hundreds upon hun- dreds have been doing their best to come up with it ever since the hue and cry was first started ; but it's no more use than diving for the philosopher's stone in a boiling caldron of patriotism. They might just as well have been hunting for-pshaw, "a needle in a haystack" is no  sort of comparison-for-for-a fanatic's reason a patron's memory, a client's gratitude, an office-seeker's modesty, or any other inconceivable " phe-no-me-na!"

The Mrs. Delicacys-sweet, gentle, retiring, lady- like, or poor sickly creatures--led off. And if any body could have found it, you'd have thought they might, for they couldn't, or wouldn't, or didn't look for it in any thing so masculine as 'business,' whether able to fee one set of agents for doing it, and another for overseeing them or not ; and any gentlemen of their acquaintance would, you know, ' attend to it with a great deal of pleasure,' if they only had time and didn't happen to forget it ; but what with smoking cigars, 'cussing' and discussing politics, icing brandy-smashers, and trying to raise poles to the height of human folly, they were one and all 'so desperately hurried and worried,' that really i  'they did wish women would quit making such rag- It  babies of themselves, take their own proper sphere and fill it, and not torment them to death with their ever- lasting importunity " "How absurd, just as if it made the slightest differ- ence whether their affairs were attended to now or some time after the day of judgment; but then, poor creatures, I suppose they can't help thinking it does,  sometimes, so it's rather a pity, but what they might."

"Well, they missed it, you see, and their cousins, the Mrs. Easys, who slipped quietly down from parlor to kitchen, from house to pig-stye, and as fast as real es- tate disappeared put the more personal property in its place, didn't do a bit better; for as soon as it was discover- ed that every individual piece had the kind of flaw called "a mouth," some men thought, and thought pretty loud too, that a woman's legitimate sphere didn't consist in lumbering up the world with rubbish that couldn't even be turned over to the sheriff; or thrown in with other live stock to eke out 'a capital speculation.' Mrs. Hold-her-own, Lookout, and Mind-her-own-busi- ness, agreed with them-wouldn't even look for it in the nest of that old goose, whose custom it was to lay golden eggs, be picked, plucked, starved, and otherwise "done to death," to enable her lord and master to cut a dash and astonish all out-doors-had no faith in their " ins- sion" to enrich the family circle with half a dozen loafers, and as many more walking brandy bottles or milliners' shops, apiece-didn't worship St. Griselda, ad- mire "water lots," paper cities, and other ingenious in- ventions, for enabling keen-sighted fiscal operators to see quite through their own property and their wives' too; nor believe, most religiously, in loving their neighbors a great deal better than themselves! Of course nobody expected them to find it; and every righteous usurer, gambler, or rumseller, unjustly defrauded of his three or     36       FAMLY PAPERS AND four hundred per cent. ; every disinterested c friend of the family," choused out of some " smashing business" by stupid prejudice against new scrip and absurd love of old parchment; every charitable, public-spirited law-  yer, trustee and guardian, unfortunately interdicted from building hospitals, churches and colleges, at the expense of his client or ward; every ill-used tenant, forced by legal hocus-pocus to balk some "capital fel  low" of a landlord of champagne frolics, oyster suppers,  dice and other condiments of the back saloon, when he could just as well furnish him a trifling advance at a  slight discount of fifty or sixty per cent. as not, was,  you may be sure, utterly and instinctively shocked and disgusted with such insolence, meanness, unnatural sus- picion, revolting selfishness, and most shameless and un-  feminine intervention!     ,  The world had got to a pretty pass,-it had indeed, if all good-fellowship, inventive genius, the interests of  commerce, scientific demonstration, individual and joint-  stock enterprise were to be held in check by silly woman's  caprice! What should she know of banking and tra-  ding and splendid operations, altogether above her ken?  What right had she to go "mixing herself up with men's business" find out that her confidential friend had got her last dollar invested in his own name, and make him refund before they, his sworn chums, choice spirits,  and honorable creditors, could get hold of it? It was A infamous, indeed it was!  If woman hadn't sense  enough to consult her true interest, confine herself to her  own sphere, and see only through man's optics, it was time somebody taught her that it was! They, for their r   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       37 part, didn't see what law was made for, if it couldn't protect men's rights a little better; and long and loud they bewailed their own hard fate, and sobbed "our sufferings is intolerable!"But when one Biddy O'Niver- fail slipped into a vulgar "hell," pounced on her own silver spoons and made off with the dollars "scraped to- gither Jist to pay the rint, buy the wee bit o' coal, and the darlint's shoes," then didn't they use strong lan- guage, Oh, but did'nt they? It took three full hours before they could find a sheet of paper strong enough to hold it, and four "good men and true," sworn to make her a public example and de- fend all henpecked husbandry from such high-handed outrage in future, to carry it and her effigy up to the pillory; but as ill-luck would have it, the "old un" (who is always on hand to help his own, I think) had one of his regular "limbs" articled there, and what did the sneering little imp-knowing he couldn't look inno- cent if he tried--do, the moment he set his eyes on left my bed," but stick his arms akimbo and ask if my uncle" took in lodgers, and when he came to "and board," screw himself up into a most diabolical twist, and hint that she "might have been scrouged out from under the doggery table?"Consequently the "Old boss" (I don't mean the very oldest one), after administering, as was proper, a sharp box on the place where young Impudence's jaw had been, and ascertain- ing that the other culprit wouldn't be like to go security for his (the printer's) fee, concluded that such "low personalities" vere beneath the notice of first class papers like his; though he kindly volunteered to make     38       FAMLY PAPERS AND '%/ the piffair a sort of standing, unwritten text for all the grave homilies, reprimands, affectionate appeals, fatherly admonitions and 4' grand palavers" which he and other argus-eyed might from time to time see fit to bestow on the  sex at large, irrespective of rank or class. So in the  long run Biddy got off just as scot-free as any of the balance, and rather amused, if the truth must be told, at the witty little squibs, jests and jibes eliminated. "A very good wit" they all had ; it hurt nobody, but good does sometimes come out of evil; thousands who never   I would have found time to make any exploring expedi- tions themselves, have in consequence been vastly en- lightened as to the precise whereabouts and cosmogUy,;yl of WOMBANS SPHERE.

"Dear, dear, how it must worry your poor father and husband, Carrie, for us to sit up all night writing their   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       39 sermons and editorials, when they've overdone them- selves a little, eating and drinking for -the good of hu- manity!"

"Yes, but that's all over, Kate,-there's to be no more toil, and mud, and dust for us now; no parents are ever more to bring daughters into the world and leave them to shift for themselves ; no father dare to die without first providing them at least one husband and two children apiece; no helpless young mother to be left with herself and family to provide for; no selfish, monopolizing spouse, dream of making his exit before looking up a successor; no stupid, obstinate, domineer- ing, or worthless, unprincipled incumbrance, to force the weaker vessel to breast life's surges alone, or with some ignorant, reckless, gambling, drunken pilot at the helm; no faithless young lover to take himself off and leave his intended to wear the willow; no true-hearted one to wing his flight to a brighter sphere and bequeathe her the cypress!

NUMBER Two, fare ex- tra (and discretionary with your surly captor), in a fbrlorn dirty old omnibus, that tells you the moment you are seated, and have time to look 'round, how completely you were 'sold" by that dealer in irony, who Mserted Number Two, to be "one of the first hotels in the country." Number One, handsome reception-room, where you can sit or recline at your ease, till the presiding genius comprehends intuitively where you and your belongings can be bestowed most entirely to your own satisfaction. Number Two, sit in the public gangway, or stand and hold up the banisters till somebody comes and shuffles you off into the first vacant space. Number One, ROOMS airy, good-sized, faultlessly clean, and not en- tirely cut off from all communication with the out-door     48       FAMLY PAPERS AND world; Number Two, not very diminutive, but rather calculated to show off your accomplishments in the art of packing baggage in the smallest possible compass,  and commanding a charming surveillance of the sayings and doings, gymnastics and callo-thumpion rehearsals! of the whole kitchen menage.  X Number One, CHAIRS, half dozen, rosewood and ma- ;: hogany, spring-seat and cane-bottom; Number Two,  one Windsor, two cane-bottom, all very common. Num-  ber One, CARPET good, good of its kind, and in good  preservation-not the slightest occasion for a score of t Secession and Woman's Right newspapers to interdict  an unholy alliance offensive and retentive between it  and the soles of your shoes. Number Two, medium Scotch, judging from remoter parts, the more contiguous being so patriotically attached to the soil of their coun- try, that, like other patriots, their precise stripe and  color is a little dubious. Mem. Fine thing, my Aunt Betsey's lost her specs, and off to the rescue of Mr. Dick, who was entrapped, poor man, while lying in a collapse after his great effort in the long closing speech on the Woman's Right ques- tion, and forcibly inducted, SHE THNKS, into the chair of Befoggery in the Transmundane, Cosmopolite, Hybrid- ity Institute, by some sur loi, sub terre, kidnapping, manifestation kelpies; though, my own opinion is, that he's been regularly burked, for not finding the NEW- LIGHT rapped out of empty heads, tilting chairs, and tipping tables ;-but don't we know somebody else, this side California, that would be, apt to say, "wash" it, or send it on a short pleasure-trip at the stern o a   I   ^    OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       49 steamer, and see it come back, much reduced in specific gravity, but more improved in elasticity and general sa- lubrity? Well, I reckon!  Number One, FIREPLAe   larble, closed (supposing it to be summer), with highly polished fancy network, cast-iron grating, showing a background of spotless white; Number Two, hearth-brick painted red, fire- place plastered and whitewashed very fairly, and fur- nished with two green-footed andirons, supposed to be brass, and a pair, done up one in white, the other in newspaper. Mem. Convenient place to sweep other papers, and all sorts of trash-saves labor! Number One, MOSQUITO-BARS, best lace, exquisitely white, tent style, suspended per centre, its graceful folds spread out at night without any hint of yours, and thrown back by day overhead of low French lounge bed- stead, where you can get on anid off just as easy as not. Number Two, scrapped and patched, cross-barred, and lace, very yellow fixtures (unless you understand "the hang" of the things, and can get them down yourself), over apparently new, but very suspiciously worm-eaten "testers" and regular turned post, high old-fashioned bedstead. If young, hale and active, you can take a flying leap, and light somewhere near the middle; if not, just shove a trunk or two alongside, and you'll climb up after a while, may be. Number One, CouNTERPANE, finest Marseilles, changed once a week, if you stay so long; sheets and pillow- slips twice ditto, and oftener, if a drop of tea, or speck of any kind, happens to bedim their spotless sheen. Mattress, new and fresh, double-spring, and very best 3     50       FAMLY PAPERS AND quality, that nothing but a guilty conscience could pos- sibly make lie hard, if you should try by any fair means twenty-three hours out of twenty-four; and all made to fit the bedstead and each other so exactly, you can't get them out of sorts and " all up in a mess," do what you will. Oh, you may haul and pull, and twist and screw, and turn and tumble, it's no use, there they are. Num- ber Two, old dimity " cover" basted, darned, dirty and dingy; sheets, &c., common cotton, the same dark- colored white, only "a little more so;" setting you right off, if the least bit metaphysical, speculating on the probable prices of soap and water, and how many one dozen ironings are equivalent to any one washing, in that " first-class" establishment. Bed, about as elastic as the " soft side of a plank ;" but if wise, and not feel- ing about as amiable as a porcupine at bay, you won't carry your investigations into other people's domestic concerns much further; indeed, there's no occasion to look. Pillows, twenty by nine inches, or thereabouts, but not very peripatetic, considering how much they have already outgrown their cases, their excursions (and those of their adjuncts) being generally bounded by big trunk on one side, and bureau on the other; unless mosquitoes are " very bad," in which case Betty or Bridget will probably find them somewhere about the room, or just out of the window. Number One, CENTRE-TABLE mahogany, with hand- some cover and Bible; wardrobe, side-table, bureau and Sits swashstand rosewood dike bedstead); the latter with marble-tops (Italian), to match hearth and mantel-piece. Furniture of washstand, &c., &c., all complete, double   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       51 sets; wares, china i, fne and white, full complement, made to order, and nothing wanting. Number Two wardrobe and centre-table among the missing; bedstead sycamore; bureau mahogany face, and respectable glass, X t otherwise very ordinary, and much neglected. Wash- g stand and side-table common deal, painted divers colors, g to correspond with every thing, where nothing looks like g any thing else, nor any two like each other. Furniture of washstand, one hard, dark towel per diem, with nearly half a set of common white- and motley delf, minus a top here, bottom there, and handle somewhere else,--looking, for all the world, like trophies won in the grand scramble, after a general smash-up in some old -;a crockery concern. Side-table, rather hors du combat, and shoved back out of the way into a dark corner; but if you want to eat, or write, just help that choice collec- tion to emigrate; put one foot into the soap-stand (there's no cover, nor soap bigger than a wafer, to hurt or hinder), the other into the washbowl, and make yourself comfortable. They are quite clean now, you know, though I'm afraid you don't read your Bible as much as you should, or you'd remember, that "evil communications corrupt good manners," and not suffer that little finger-brush of yours to scrape acquaintance with all the coarse wedgewood and dirty stone-china in the country. Don't tell me there isn't any; haven't you got one of your own, I should like to know? And, be- sides, what right have you to go about compromising the dignity of the toga, by enacting the "old woman," who got so much dirt by sweeping up once a year, that I' V'VrUUUIL     52       FAMLY PAPERS AND she wondered "what upon airth people did do with it all when they'cleaned up every day?"  N. B. If the establishments were large, and yielded, in proportion as much dust, dirt, lint and feathers, as I've seen on and under some tables, beds and bureaus  lately (I don't mean yours now, Number Two), I sus-  pect they must have to employ a special train for its transportation ; but that's a mere speculation. Number -Two, wheel round, turn a crank on the wall, and it's just as certain as " manifest destiny," that somebody 'll come up before you've half a chance to for-  get what you wanted, looking so neat and cheerful, po-  lite, and perfectly respectful, that you can't possibly  speak cross, or feel ill-natured, if you want to ever so  much. Number Two, pretty fair cord and tassel, where  you are welcome to exercise your patience and muscles  all day, if you like-though I don't know so well about  that, either, for when Paddy and Sukey can't stand ' that confounded bell" any longer, it's a chance if some greasy, slatternly, blubber-lipped darky, or raw Celt- innocent of Anglo-Saxon as a Shanghai of high Latin- doesn't come up looking shillalahs and vinegar-cruets at- you, as much as to say, I'll tache ye better manners, sir, nor to be ringing me up any more, disthurbing the swatest nap, or the natest reel in the world ;" and I reckon you won't, if you can help it. - But a word to you, Number One. People like to look at pretty pic- tures, you know, and how do you know but they some- times ring oftener than they would, if you didn't keep some uncommonly good-looking ones about? Verbum   ........... Ju  sap-Number Two, you see, understands this matter rather better. Number One FARE} every luxury that sea and land, capital and skill, can command; got up in every con- ceivable style but a bad or indifferent one, as if to prove that it's not high living, but gormandizing,--not rich cooking, but bad cooking, that makes people sick. For desserts, the whole science of pastry and confectionery illustrated. Prelude, fresh bills of fare three times a day; accompaniment, music to aid digestion. Numbeir Two, half-boiled edibles for the vegetarian, raw enough to cook, and come again; huge masses of fish, flesh and fowl for the carnivorous, with lobsters, shrimps (and, for aught I know, toads, frogs, snails, centipedes, and other fresh-water reptiles) yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow by way of variety. Dessert, sugar and lard-lard, su- gar, and rice, slightly disguised with flour, and other va- riations. Music (about six hours every day), knife-and- fork prelude, plate-rattle chorus and gong interlude; and tin-pans and callothumpions hide your diminished heads, you can't shine again after that gong! Bill of Fare (once a day if you insist), a regular veteran in small type epaulettes, and gmost magnificent pen-flour- ishing ",contiuations," that mean exactly what they don't say; so if you fancy Irish potatoes, invaluable in a state of siege, where lead and bullets are exhausted, just mark  green peas," or ' corn "-underscore " broiled chicken, and you'll probably get a huge chunk of black- looking meat, swimming in a whole plate-no, saucer, full of beef, or mutton tallow, but not so much as a little finger-napkin to bless yourself withal.     54       FAMLY PAPERS AND Comparisons may be "odorous," as Mrs. Malaprop says, and somewhat lengthy too, but it takes a first-rate artist to bring a "full length" before every mind's eye with one or two pen-and-ink dashes; so you see, Number Two, that if I hadn't gone into " specialty- pleas" like, you'd have lost all the beauty of contrast, and never known for certain whether it was yourself, or somebody else, that had the honor of sitting. And now, to show that I'm not playing censor, and putting on. airs, like other subs, because my'superior's out of the way; and have, after all, just as much " sneaking kind- ness" for you left, as could reasonably be expected from one of that flayed-alive, and barbecued set of mortals, called travellers,-I'm going, with a laudable zeal for your improvement, to put you in a way of seeing what's what, with your own eyes.  Just make up a wallet-I paid you enough for no value received, the fractions being about right, the units all extra, to help along considerable-then take up a line of march " straight for California;" but don't go as ifshot out of a catapult, that isn't the way to learn any thng, and sea water is, I take it, about as salt one side of e Isthmus as the other; and some people along the coastfancy that " some things can be done as well as others." You'll'find several nice settlements, or places where nice settlements 5ught to be; one, in particular, promises to be a right .smart little village, when Lake Erie gets turned upside down into the Gulf of Mexico: but if you don't find Number One there, just go on till you do-when you come to the right place, any body can tell you which it is.   v - J' lVlaliA JUkU U JIYMUIN '1. i .  Should the unaccustomed quiet and apparent leisure get rather alarming, and you begin to feel some misgiv- ings about remaining any longer in that enchanted castle, where every thing must be done by magic, or some invisible troops of fairies, it's all done so quick, noiselessly, and well, go right off to head magician, and make " a clean breast" of it. Having nothing in the world to fear from your rivalry, he won't mind enlight- ening you, till you can forget more in the next half hour than you ever knew before in all your life; or taking you round to see what sort of fairies' he does operate with. When you have digested all that, just "possum it" a day or two-no, that won't be necessary either- just think of going back to Number Two, and if that doesn't lay you up for a good week, you are a man of some nerve-that's all! And, then, won't 'that attend- ant, who knows exactly what you want quite as well, if not a little better, than you do yourself, bring you every thing you ask for, and some others, which he thinks you ought to want, and would want, if you could only see them instead of the bill? Of course he will; and that elegant tea and-dinner-service, with its superior cutlery, plate, china, and English glass, doesn't it look refresh- ing? Certainly; and those fine waiters, too-too fine not to be covered afresh three times a day with the finest and glossiest of damask; and those peerless napkins, looking so like incarnate light, or woven snow-wreaths- stop! you don't presume to think of laying your unholy, earth-worm fingers on that visible purity, without first breathing a sigh for some similar lustration to reach your own sin-soiled, wor-worn spirit! If you do, you are a     sinner "past praying for,"/' I fear; but 'Number One doesn't know that, and won't he call up to see you-see if you will have a physician, or any thing else ; send up his compliments to know how you are, with books and papers to amuse you--the paragraphs all marked that he thinks will specially interest you-and bring up agreeable company to entertain you ? To be sure he will-no kind of doubt of it; ask if there is any thing else he can do for you--do it, too; collect information, and let you know when it is done, without waiting for you to inquire; give you his advice (and it's a better article than you get every day free gratis) ; and all this time do you ever catch him look- ing icebergs, thunderbolts, and percussion-caps, till you expect every moment to hear, " Confound your impu- dence !" (or some other wicked words,) " do you suppose I've got nothing else to do, but look after you and your affairs ?"  No, you don't-you would really suppose he thought it was his business how his guests enjoyed themselves-his special pleasure to supply your want of tact and judgment; and a pretty heavy surplus capital he must have to make up for some people's deficiencies, as I happen to know ! Well, you feel better, now, don't you ? Yes, I see you do ; and when you see how much one kindly heart and master-spirit can perform, you feel very much like breaking every glass that reflects a flurried, petulant, im- patient face, giving Paddy a clean shirt, Sukey and Sambo at least one pound of soap and a bucket of wa- ter apiece, and starting all those coarse, odd, black- looking old saucers, that you use for plates, with that    common, dirty-handled broken-tined cutlery, and the rest of that "tag-rag and bobtail" dining and bedroom furniture (that in the parlor will do a while longer if you'll only have the piano tuned), off to some beggars' jauction--of course you do, and won't forget those young alf-breed, Japan and sheet-iron waiters either  Then ere's that a.eT ere's that antique gem of the kind, the one you know that-ahem, it's an ugly word, and as you are going to reform-you mean to, don't you ?--why I won't say it though how you ever did get off scot  r e with such a treasure, I'm sure I  can't divine; but you'll send it right back to the plain of Shinar, won't you ? The one I mean that was made out of Mrs. Noah's two old worn-out dustpans, spliced togetherin the middle. And not a bad idea that of the maker, nicking off the four orners to give it somewhat of an octagonal air, though tits a pity his "sodder" all "give out," so that he had to leave them   all standing "every which way fbr Sun- day," it gives it such a  reckless, " torn-down " appear- ance; or if you don't like to "acknowledge the corn% " and think Mr. Layard won't    care, just hand it  over to me, and I'll do my best to get it to the World's Fair.. spite of all the Barnums in  existence.

Don't you know " it hurts me a great deal worse than it does you, and it's allfor your own good, and you'll thank mefor it some day," as Mrs. Doctor Birch used to tell her hopeful progeny, when taking them through a course of the tallest kind of sprouts; and for which good service not the first one of the ungrateful little wretches ever has thanked her to this day, that ever I could learn? But don't you imitate their naughty example, for if you don't go right home and strike your colors down to  R half-mast, or run up your accommodations to high-     io water mark about the quickest, all the world will know  th you have a great deal more impudence and less ignorance  w] than I give you credit for!

Should a politic, worldly-wise man, even, so wantonly dissipate that "odor of superior sanctity,'" that prestige of an unction from on high, on which his social as well as sacerdotal supremacy, so preeminently rests?

Once, when some hungry "vally- d- y m," underscullion or out-door sub of a by-gone dynasty, cried lustily for "more pap in behalf of his arinihing wife and children, then who but you was the very first man to come forward, declaring that although constitutionally and teetotally opposed to that kitchen et and the whole menage, you could not and would not harden your heart against such pathetic eals to charity; and forthwith set up a contributionb , and reported "a brass button, rusty nail, and pew er ap- poon" as the result ofyour humane exertions?  -and "oh what a fall is there my countrymen "I'm ctually afraid to trust you with this little bit to '     74       FAMLY PAPERS AND bridle king Solomon long since prescribed.; though if long ears would only bray any where else it wouldnt  much signify; but here in the newspaper, your news- paper that has in the main set them a much better example, it's a little too bad, indeed our sufferings is intolerable 1" Without wishing to broach any new heresy, or flatter you in the least, I must say, that all things considered, newspapers are, I think, rather an item in modern liter- ature, and on the whole I like some of them.

And here you begin to get an inkling of my grievance and your misdemeanor, but only an inkling, mind you, I'm too much in a hurry (witness my speed) for any thing else ; a fact I mention for your encourage- ment, because you might, you know, get uneasy lest I was about to " speak my speech" and be off. No, no, "mine ancient," it's out of fashion now, and " with all your faults I love you still" too well for that; and besides it takes my aunt Betsey, who hasn't the advantage of being a half-breed and knowing how to shoot all round the tree, and from every leaf and thorn of a crabtree chapporal, to do those sort of things. I hold it a useless waste of raw material when the value of an article (I'll take this one out in advertising) is measured by the yard; but honestly and soberly, we poor sinners do have hard measure dealt out to us every way. If we don't go to church, or trouble ourselves about such things at all then we are a set of hardened repro- bates or graceless allios; if we do, it's as like as not only to see our betters do the devotions, hear that their Maker is going to take them to heaven in spite of them- selves, and send us to perdition because we can't get there in spite of him, for all of which we are exhorted to love him very ddarly, and praise him devotly, be- cause he has made us to hate him most cordially and be punished everlastingly. And then these judges elect -quite enamored with the prospect of sitting on our cases hereafter, and as much incensed at seeing their meaning evoked from general expansion into visual     76       FAMLY PAPERS AND angle,-must needs practice sentencing and tormenting us before the time. They have humbugged us out of our Almanac, banned the dance, outlawed the theatre, confiscated the decanter, and stolen our novels, and all this we have borne; but when it comes to laying violent hands on our newspaper, the secular newspaper, then we say hands off! We don't presume to lay our ungodly fingers on your righteous columns, we don't need to be told that flippancy can't answer, nothing short of acri- mony can pass muster there, we are cast out of the synagogue, but this curbstone IS OURS! And now we say to you, keep out of our "broad road" if you don't want to be bespattered-don't rub your lawn against our sackcloth and then smite us if you get defiled, don't reflect your thoughts and acts boih on our sensorium, and then turn black in the face, if we show them up daguerreotyped in words; for verily we of the :' profane" are shocked at your insolent, all-patronizing, lord-para- mount airs, of having religions made to order, as if the Almighty had nothing else to do but match his ethics to your politics!

In that case I shall have to explain to all the Allissimas Sanctissimas, prifately, that it's a mere ruse de guerre, or complimentary salute in disguise; and when  the "lesser lights" comprehend, that it is, in fact, a tacit admission of their potency, they can't in conscience be very implacable at a little financiering blunder, when all the world must know, that if practice had the small- pox principle never need be ip danger, or in other words, that "religion is one thing, ahd business another."

Journal.                         , Possesses much merit, racy and humurous sketches by an original and keen observer.-Flag of the Union, (Jackson) Miss. One of the best of its class, rare and valuable. . . Ask for it a perusal by all lovers of good reading .... Quite suggestive. -. . . . Very spirited .   ... Neatly printed and.-uniquely written, one of the books that will repay perusal.-Vicksburg Whig, Yazoo City, Natchez, Baton Rouge, and Mobile papers. We commend this very interesting work. Fluent, racy, quaint, and poetical, it cannot fail to entertain and instruct. The book is well worth the price, and the purchaser will bestow a benefit at once upon himself and another who needs, and deserves, and will duly appreciate it.-Nashville Whig. A book of real merit, written in an exceedingly sprightly style, and calculated to do good in, besides pleasing,' every circle of Southern readers.  And we do think it would be rather outre on the part of any Ken- tuckian or Southerner to withhold the reward due to Southern litera- ture.-Ky. Yeoman. * Stars indicate VOLUNTEER critiques, Editorial MS. and verbal. si     a        .   ADVERTISEMENTS. Something out of the common, with a style just as peculiarly the author's own as anything to be found in the works of Lawrence Sterne. -Telegraph, (Murfreesboro, Tenn.) * Wants nothing but abuse to make it exceedingly popular. It is a capital work. . . .  Interesting as a biography, fascinat- ing as a novel; but not to be fully appreciated either by those who never read one, or never read anything else ..   The man who sees nothing special in this, would if left to his own unguided taste, pronounce Addison a dunce, Washington Iriing-a bore, and Ik Marvel nowhere-let his mother look well to his outgoings. ... A book. for the library-we shall put ours on the shelf with Irving-to bead read and read again by all who enjoy a "silent laugh," or thrilling' pathos ....    Cannot fail to command the sympathy and admira-' tion of all men of letters for its talented and suffering authoress.-Flag and other South-western Authorities.-Publishers making private sale of Eastern consignments. A very clever production, and we feel a decided interest in the suc- cess of the writer. It is made up of letters and sketches, running through a period of some twenty years. The style is easy, graceful and sprightly throughout. A passage or two of some of the earlier effu- sions may perhaps be considered slightly irreverent, but probably was not so intended. The whole work proves itself the emanation of culti- vated intellect, sparkling fancy, keen and close observation upon men and things. Sarcasms, sharp and pungent, abound in its pages, and many of the foibles and meannesses of life are lashed with an unspar- ing hand, while here and there dashes of humor alternate with passa- ges of gentle affection or touching sorrow. A sub-tone of sadness and suffering pervades the whole, and, without extraneous aid, it would not be difficult to infer that she has suffered more than enough to crush a less determined spirit.-Franlkfort Commonwealth. * I expected to find it similar in character to many of the works that are now-a-days brought to public notice, in various ways-a sort of badly printed, badly arranged rehash of ideas, either obsolete or famil- iar to every schoolboy. But, sir, I did not know the gem I was buying. I can truly say, that no half-day's reading ever gave me more pleasure than that spent over the above-named book. The style is fresh, free, and frank-playful, witty, sarcastic and grave-law, politics and reli- gion, morality and ethics, disquisition and description, are all dished up in proper turn, in the most 'delightful style that a sprightly, intelligent, "Leen visioned" woman could write. I write the above without her cognizance, but those who patronize the lady, will find the book worth treble the price; in fact, one forgets, under the fascinating influence of its pages, all notions of common "gelt" and cent-per-cent.- Corres- pondent Kentuckian. "I always take great pleasure in expressing that high opinion of your literary power and promise which the perusal of your recent publication has enabled me so earnestly to form."-Fitz Green Halleck.
