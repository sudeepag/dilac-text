SOME inconsiderate people may expect we are going to apologize for making free with Miss Betsey's bureau de police at this particular stage of her career; and some few hardened old fogies, whose organs of veneration for modern fmanners, morals and tendencies, sadly need developing, might not care a bawhee, if we were to cast some such innuendo reflection on the honor and honesty of Young Ameica's precedent-makers; but thanks to those "emancipatepl" souls, who have from time to time prac- tically maintained, in the teeth of vulgar prejudice, that all right in matters of interest lies not in the great heads that conceive, but the light-fingered hands that hold, or execute, we know better. EVERY THNG FOR ALL (that can get it), that's our Uncle Sam's motto; but how is said ALL to get it, if any body's got any right to keep any thing back that any body else wants? It's clearly a conspiracy against the peace and dignity of all his "FREE AND ENLIGHTENED," for when people want a thing, they want it; trust a traitor to put his own papers in apple-pie order, and see     8      PREAMBILAR PER0KATIOX.   DRI3AMBILAR PERORATION. '    '9   if he don't slip out, or burn up the very ones you want: and, besides, what good will it do a man going on a trip to-day, if Mr. Dick and the missing papers should turn up to-morrow? Won't he have to be picked up next day, and acquit the engine on the morrow? Of course he will; and the fact is, he ought to have had these, and more besides, long ago; and would, too, if our su- perfluous, but well-meaning, hard-working Master Mel' hadn't been intercepted, and somewhat crippled, by the senseless kickings and cavortings of one of those old "beggars on horseback," that never can be easy to ride on their way, without riding down every thing else. However, he'll find the ingenious operation of "biting off his own nose to spite his face," pleasant and profit- able, perhaps, some day; and the unlucky ad inter, with his gallant, but ill-omened name, has rotated now, and we've taken abundant precautions that there's to be "no more of that." Miss BETSEY may chafe at having to buy another new veil, but knows very well we've got all her records in such " a fix," that nobody else ever could decipher ten consecutive words; a simple and effi- cacious plan for "holding on," that we should take great pleasure in recommending to other'secretaries and office-holders, only that most of them, it is believed, practise upon it already. True, it has this little incon- venience, we can't always make it out ourselves; and when one line's contumacious, another has to go down. This rather amalgamates styles; and one of the parties being forestalled in his designs, may take advantage of it, to pretend our version isn't genuine; but if any body doubts it, let him come and see if we haven't got hi9.   first drafts, and others, too, belonging apparently to no particular person or place, but evidently smuggled in by some supernumerary scion, or candidate on trial. It is extremely mortifying, though, that we can't tell all inquiring minds a great deal more about our chiefs private history than she knows herself; she never did like being catechised, you know, but from all that we can learn, worthy Mr. Micawher, with a disinterest- edness above all praise, directed her attention to this continent about the time of the last presidential elec- tion, and persuaded her to be on hand in case "any thing should turn up." Accordingly, we find her here soon after all Bonnetdom went " a-crabbing ;" and it was hoped, the sight of her " respectable" old beaver might arrest its course before it got quite back to Mrs. Eve's fig-leaf; but, unfortunately, a due regard for personal safety, and great horror of having to set her clogs in every predecessor's footsteps, compelled her, not only to muffle it in a double veil of deep-blue mystery, but even forego its "insane tilt," and her own patronymic, in order to escape being torn limb from limnb by those peer- less jackals, apes, and other "varmints," always on the look-out for some foreign lion! The election-much to "glorification" discomfiture -turned up FRANK PIERCE; and much to the credit of his sagacity, and Mr. Micawher's forecast, Miss BET- SEY'S unique talents were soon put in requisition. Fortunately, the official duties chimed in admirably With her own inclination to see what nobody else goes to see, and knowing that things are to names as nothing to one, she continues up to this very day passing up and   10      PREAMBILAR PERORATION. down (for the most part very quietly), under her ob- scure cognate; catching morals and manners without their holiday hats and "Sabba-dy" cloaks on, " takin notes," and dispensing meed and dreed, "all fearlessly and free," where the first inkling of her distinguished name would bring whole troops of Philistines, if not Bar- num's show-case, down upon her to "put her through" the grand paces, as they did Samson of old; bury hei "five-fathom deep" in hoodwink and "flummery,' her especial abomination; and, what is worse, deprive Mrs. Grundy, "and all the rest of mankind," of the great pleasure of knowing what she really does think of the " chief estates" and little-greats in Uncle Sam's and St. Picayune's guessing, gasing, reeling, scrambling, nomadic, stampeding jurisdictions.

And haven't I obliged, I should like to know, till I've taken on more freight from Messrs. Cotton-Bale, Dry-Goods & Co., than I can make good headway under in fair weather-want to see me swamped, don't you? "Make such capital ballast!" Glad to hear it-put it right on-don't know any body that needs it more. "Won't wear the things--hateful, ridiculous!"-" ' Stove-pipe hats,"' eh! Think to get rid of them, don't you? No use. Hats were made to wear-somebody's got to wear them, and I shan't. "Stupid, ugly, ill-contrived, unmanageable things 1" Then who but you should wear them?  "Great, awkward, stiff, intolerable bores!" Don't see but they fit you very well. "But that's only because, ma'am, you're use' to seeing us together." Don't often see you without, that's a fact. Wonder if you sleep in them- expect you can't-dare say that's the very reason now you've fallen out with them. "So 'hard and hot and heavy'-ruin your beautiful bonnet, ma'am, if they should happen to fall on it."

Can't have it; distinctions must be kept up, else how should we know which was which? " Oh, just as easy, ma'am "-Just as easy, I don't doubt, as you could have told, a year or two ago, what sort of pedal annexations ladies did have, if they had been cruel enough to shove them into pantalets like children or squaws; or break the whalebones and straitlaces of pious, peripatetic old Mrs. Roundhead, and fall back into the costume of her worthy neighbor, good, quiet, stay-at-home Mrs. Knickerbocker ;-eking it out with some sort of mufflers in compliment to the quaint, though rather irreverent sneers, of her classic historian. No, no-don't forget old friends and past kindness--my turn now-bound to keep you (far as in me lies) from making yourself ridiculous; so just make yourself easy with what you have got, and never say CAPS to me aoain.

BETSEY TROTWOOD.   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.        15 REPORT Of the selfinstalled Committee of THE TRANsOmENDEvNTAI PHAx- THROPY-EXPOBTATION SOCIETY, prospectiely convened, to tako into consideration the spirit-stirring humanity appeal of Eng- land's Mrs. Jellybys to the Ladies of America: MOST ELEVATED TRANSCENDENTALS: Your Committee having met, according to appoint- ment, in the Hall of Imagination, resolved itself into the most fitting exponent of super-empyrean benevo- lence, and agreed that our benevolence always intensi- fies most and flourishes best when its object is in any body's reach but our own, did proceed to resolve as follows: First-That whereas, facts and figures do materially impede the march of Transcendental Progress, it is here- by RESOLVED to disclaim, repudiate, and refuse to recog- nize as belonging to the human species, any specimen of the genus homo who shall decline to aid and abet, to the extent of his ability, in dethroning Statistics, Official Investigations, Parliamentary Reports and Scien- tific Demonstrations from their usurped supremacy over the mind of man; and install in their place the very reliable lucubrations of that profoundly erudite, incon- testably matter-of-fact and  pre-eminently veracious class of historians, commonly known as novelists or romancers. Second-That in consideration of the important services rendered by these disinterested though ill-used evangelists of "Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality," it is RESOLVED to request and advise all publishers to issue     16       FAMLY PAPERS AND their works- hereafter, not from " love of filthy lucre," but " free gratis," for the good of the race and other sympathy-mongers to combine and endow a college of criticism, with a capital of fifty millions, and authority to award premiums of frbm five to fifty thousand per annum, to the more meritorious of these High Priests of Utopian Theology. Third-Be it also RESOLVED, That your commander- in-chief for the Home Department be instructed to de- spatch suitable officers into the Interior, with orders to make full and impartial investigation into all the griev- ances, moral and physical, said to exist not only in the Qbscure streets, dens, lanes and alleys of the populous cities, but also in the mining, manufacturing, and agri- cultural districts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the adjacent Province of France, and suggest the most expeditious mode of redressing the same ; and the Sec- retary for Foreign Affairs authorized and otherwise em- powered to invite the distinguished Charles Dickens and Eugene Sue to lecture our humane and intelligent coun- trymen on the enormities perpetrated, without their privity or concurrence, in the Schools, Factories, Work- houses, Hospitals, garrets and cellars of Paris and Lon- don, and desigiate such of our eminent citizens as are, in their opinion, the most proper persons to interfere promptly and efficiently in the premises. Fourth--Being seriously apprehensive that a certain ultramundane region denominated Herschel is miserably deficient in light if not heat, this Committee do most unhesitatingly RESOLVE to petition Congress immediately for a grant of five hundred millions to erect and furnish A   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       17 Observatories through which all sympathizers caf exam- ine critically into the state of that planet and the solar system generally f and also to charter forthwith THE GRAND CONCENTRIC UNIVERSE GAS COMPANY, with full power to lay pipes, establish reservoirs, contract for moonshine, levy subscriptions, and appropriate the right of way throughout the entire extent of those ulterior dependencies; Government being allowed to purchase one-half the whole stock in advance, at a premium of ten per cent., on condition that it give the President and Board of Directors carte blanche as to amount, and pledge itself to legalize and sustain all their acts and ordinances ab initio. Fifth-Having observed with extreme pleasure the affectionate interest which enlightened denizens of our Territory of Great Britain evince in all our domestic concerns, this Committee do unanimously RESOLVE that the said Territory is now worthy to be, and hereby is, elevated by brevet to the rank and dignity of a Sove- reign Independent State, with all the rights, privileges, and immunities, present and prospective, appertaining to any other member, oriental or occidental, now, or hereqfter to be admitted into this grand confederacy; in ratification whereof this Committee tenders in behalf of society, the right hand of fellowship and fraterniza- tion to the right honorable and well-beloved transatlantic sisters and confreres, so nobly ambitious of competing with us the honor of re-organizing the whole social and material system. And,finally-Be it resolved that this Committee do now adjourn, repair to the Pantheon of all Abstractions,     18       FAMLY PAPERS AND submit these resolutions, and ask to be discharged from further service. FANCY TOPLOFTICAL, Chairman. The foregoing Resolutions having been duly present- ed and passed by acclamation-the House previously resolving itself into Committe of the Whole for their reception-it was further RESOLVED, 1st, That the Com- mittee be discharged with many thanks for its prompt and harmonious action, and very able and lucid exposi- tion of the precise views and objects of this Society; and, 2d, That copies of these and the aforesaid resolu- tions be immediately transmitted to agents and coadju- tors in all parts of our jurisdiction; and the Pulpit and Press, without distinction of sect or party, be invited and required, under penalty of our displeasure, to give them and the principles therein so luminously embodied, all the sanction, advocacy, and dissemination which their own intrinsic merit, and the exigency of the case, so im- periously demand.

OH, my spirit's chord hath lost its tone, Hope's sparkling sands are running low, And the weary days, the long, the lone, None cares, alas, how soon they go! Yet the Southern heart is warm and true As the seraph sheen on wing of light; And like moon-kiss soft on honey-dew, Just such is its smile of gentle light: But the stranger's heart is dark with woe, And the minstrel harp is all unstrung; For unheeded falls that music's flow That falters on a stammering tongue.

FANNY, my child, your mother does know you are out, but means to let you have your own way, without any fuss, as all reasonable, well-behaved parents should, when they know they can't help themselves. But my dear, why don't you strike all round when you get the "cat" in your hand, instead of stopping short with a few ill-bred editors, whose mothers, poor silly things, never taught them the first principles of civilization. I don't half like such invidious distinc- tions. There's the whole tribe of "Itching Ears now,"- just listen at them, when they happen to pounce on a suspected contributor, or get a real live author by the button! One would think they'd bought him instead of his book or article, and ten to one if they didn't   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       21 borrow that. And yet what a sweet howl they'd set up, if, after carefully folding down the page of a letter, you should deliberately turn it up and read every mortal syllable before their face and eyes.

Hurting people's feelings, I take to be the main ob- ject of " blowing them up," and when they haven't any to hurt, it's labor lost; and 'twould break your dear little heart to see your venerable mother -atigue herself to no purpose ; but couldn't you, honey, just give them a little oil of Lash?

Well, I told you so, with all your old frumpery notions about decorum, and delicacy and urbanity, just fit to rusticate with Chinese mandarins and Dutch burgomasters in some old land- scape garden.

That isn't the civil chat for a model mamma who knows her place and conducts so sensibly!"Give 'em a little oil of Lash?"

It isn't enough, is it, that every guessing, prying, keyhole editor in the land must be bragging that Mr. SO-AND-SO, "the inevitable Mr. So- and-so," shook him by the paw, or walked into his sanc- tum, but you must infest the high seas to waylay and capture all innocent fugitives from notoriety? Who gave you "Letters of Marque," I should like to know, that you've any right to board a strange craft, and or- der the captain to stand and deliver "a full and par- ticular" of his own private history, with that of the crew and all other cargo?

Thought as much--and, harkee, Mr. Scout, and you, too, Captain Itemizer Longhow, my wife's cousin, Sour- krout Snapdragon, Esq., says he's kin to old Judge Lynch, and thinks an unhung spy, unlicensed priva- teer, and poacher at large, little better than PUBLIC NUISANCES! And here are you, too, modest Mrs. Dotell, with your old aunt, Eve Whatdoes! Have you ever a Bible between you, with a word in it about Busybodies, and don't you feel ashamed of yourselves now? No, you don't-you haven't got sense of propriety enough to feel ashamed of any thing!

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       27 THE ENGLISH IS A STRONG LANGUAGE. "STRONG," no mistake about that!-strong, I should rather think it was, to be identified at this present, after all the hauling and pulling, and twistingi and screwing, to make it "walk Ground about the truth," till there's scarce a word with an inkling of its original signification left! Here's WOMAN now, once it meant a companion "meet" for man, when man was made in the image of his Maker; now, a poor vulgar creature made (for other people's convenience) out of the refuse clay, unfit for the crystal and china wares of creation. Then, when this "woman" was lawfully married, she was the wife of her husband. "And isn't she now, pray?" Not a bit of it, sir! She's nothing in the world but his lady; that is, some sort of feminine appendage-it may be his sister, his neighbor, his cousin, or it may be something else, not altogether so presentable;; so you'd better keep your eyes open, and make your own inferences-I can't help you, though it's evidently some incumbrance between him and the rest of the baggage. And LADY, too ;-old writers tell us it comes from lafdy, a contraction of laf, a loaf, and day, which signi- fied a loaf-giver; that is, a domestic sort of personage rather given to benevolence and hospitality. Nor, it neans a bundle of intense selfishness done up in "a mighty void of sense," and moulded by fashion into a walking advertisement of more millinery, gewgaws, and other dry goods-no matter whose or how come by- than any small craft could make good sail under, if she     28       FAMLY PAPERS AND hadn't shipped more airs than would float a balloon. And then GENTLEMAN I Time was when that meant  "a man without fear and without reproach," now it means-shades of all the Bayards what does it mean? Well, I don't wish to be too critical, and the English certainly is a strong language and a copious, but it strikes me it can't quite come up to that defi- nition!  ;       7 :    i  O  Here Miss Betsey-you've heard of my aunt BET-  BEY TnOTWOOD, the new CENSOR, haven't you?---gave an "insane tilt" of her beaver at my bundle of rods i and fainted, just as one of the new specimens bawled  out the name of another changeling, CHARITY,-in excuse i for fagging a young girl to death, whose father he had  swindled out of his last dollar, and into a drunkard's  grave. I know it's no manner of use this "tickling a rhi-  nocerous with straws," and have my doubts about the propriety of casting "pearls before swine " but sup- pose I must do her bidding, or be reformed out of office, and lose all the reward of my uncommon filial piety; so, do you know, sir, that of two inspired apostles, one gives  the definition of that word synthetically and senten- i tiously as LOVE, and the other goes into the analysis more elaborately? Of course you don't, and it's a won-  der to me that some enterprising colporteur, or getter- up of pious young story-books for grown-up old children, don't think of interspersing a few texts of Scripture in  the Price Current, for the benefit of those who never read any thing else; but neither of them ever dreams of confounding it with throwing ('by order of the    OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       29 board") a dog's bone with a dog's treatment, at some audacious wretch who brings his misery " between the wind and your nobility," and then chanting loud paeans to your own munificence, and caustic invectives on his ingratitude. Ingratitude, indeed! And what for should he be grateful? That you have pelted off a nuisance with dirty coppers and more bitter words, more to relieve your own eyes than his necessities? Don't he know, as well as you, how easily you can poke your hands into your own, pockets, say, "so many appeals to charity," and "pass over on the. other side," when they are only reported to you? To be sure he does; and don't he know, too, that this very " so many," is generally proof positive that you never respond to any? None better; and here you swell up, as if the world never saw the like of such magnanimity, because you take in an orphan child, as well if not better born than your own, and their equal, or superior, it may be, in every thing but present position; or (when you can't help it) patronize in some sort an unfortunate acquaintance, that you were once proud,*perhaps, in your very heart's core, to call your "friend," make her the bond slave of all your wills, exact ever after the labor of a Hercules, the patience of Job the meekness of Moses, the devotion of a martyr, the love of a seraph, and the servility of a toady; and then feel amazed beyond measure if she isn't willing, ever after, to go to perdition, if necessary, to save you and yours from " dying of a rose in aromatic pain." MONSTROUS, isn't it, this "black ingratitude of     30       FAMLY PAPERS AND human nature" (certes if it exists), and altogether inex- plicable? Not quite! Did you never reflect, that "man is of three natures, reguiring all for charity," that no one feels specially thankful for what he has paid for, over and over, and that this very proscribed ingrate feels in his secret soul that you have taken your pay drop by drop out of his heart's blood to the very last farthing, and ten times over, in the pleasure of trampling down, in your coldness, your passion or your pride, all the in- dependence of his nature-scoffing, sneering, deriding and ignoring all the finer feelings of his being? And he has paid you, for " a man's self-respect is worth more to him than money, and evil is the charity that hum- bleth and maketh man less happy!" Once I saw a lady engage some domestic "finery," and wear it too, despite her own excellent taste, lest the ingenious manufacturer should consider the purchase. a mere pretext for bestowing a -few dollars which she herself but ill could spare ; and that was charity, but yours-go to, you don't even understand its first princi- ples, never take the word in your mouth again till you know what it means! You have not given " to diligence as to an equal," and the extorted pittance is deadly aconite to the soul!

I am afraid flannels and domestics must be scarce, and my own stock is getting rather low; but inasmuch as he "that hath two coats" is enjoined to " give to him that hath none," I'll try and squeeze out one rather than he and his brethren, lay and clerical, who figure on the opposite side, shouldn't be properly attired. But why in the name of common sense-if she isn't defunct-can't they see, that when the third gender goes about to raise a fuss, "kick up a row," and "ele- vate the ancient Henry" generally, there's no way like "Ietting it alone very severely," if they want it to go home and mind its own business, if it's got any, and leave them to do the talking; which it never will so long as they keep it before the public in so many point- less jests and pithless invectives, evincing nothing half so clearly as a hearty, good will to be witty and sarcastic if they only could. Well, there's a vast deal of weakness and wicked- ness stirring, no doubt ; but it strikes me a Highland seer would have thought of turning his own coat before making so- many mislicks; yet here they all are, and never a man of them dreaming that he's only playing showman and " second fiddle " to this fillibustering lusus, and keeping it in countenance, by showing the world that there can be something a little more ridiculous!

Why, I tell you, man, it could give odds, carry weight and beat all hollow, at the very first clip, any other will-o'-wisp ever seen this side Adam's fall!

"How absurd, just as if it made the slightest differ- ence whether their affairs were attended to now  oi some time after the day of judgment; but then, poor creatures, I suppose they can't help thinking it does, sometimes, so it's rather a pity, but what they might."

Mrs. Hold-her-own, Lookout, and Mind-her-own-busi- ness, agreed with them-wouldn't even look for it in the nest of that old goose, whose custom it was to lay golden eggs, be picked, plucked, starved, and otherwise s" done to death," to enable her lord and master to cut a dash and astonish all out-doors-had no faith in their " ins- sion" to enrich the family circle with half a dozen loafers, and as many more walking brandy bottles or milliners' shops, apiece-didn't worship St. Griselda, ad- mire " water lots," paper cities, and other ingenious in- ventions, for enabling keen-sighted fiscal operators to see quite through their own property and their wives' too; inor believe, most religiously, in loving their neighbors a- great deal better than themselves!

The world had got to a pretty pass,-it had indeed, if all good-fellowship, inventive genius, the interests of commerce, scientific demonstration, individual and joint- stock enterprise were to be held in check by silly woman's caprice! What should she know of banking and tra- ding and splendid operations, altogether above her ken? What right had she to go "mixing herself up with enen's business," find out that her confidential friend had got her last dollar invested in his own name, and make him refund before they, his sworn chums, choice spirits, and honorable creditors, could get hold of it? It .was infamous, indeed it was!  If woman hadn't sense enough to consult her true interest, confine herself to her own sphere; and see only through man's optics, it was time somebody taught her that it was! They, for their   Ft     OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       37 part, didn't see what law was made for, if it couldn't protect men's lights a little better; and long and loud they bewailed their own hard fate, and sobbed, "our sufferings is intolerable!"But when one Biddy O'Niver- fail slipped into a vulgar " hell," pounced on her own silver spoons and made off with the dollars " scraped to- gither jist to pay the rint, buy the wee bit o' coal, and the darlint's shoes," then didn't they use strong lan- guage, Oh, but did'nt they? It took three full hours before they could find a sheet of paper strong enough to hold it, and four " good men and true," sworn to make her a public example and de- fend all henpecked husbandry from such high-handed outrage in fhture, to carry it and her effigy up to the pillory; but as ill-luck would have it, the "old un" (who is always on hand to help his own, I think) had one of his regular " limbs" articled there, and what did the sneering little imp-knowing he couldn't look inno- cent if he tried-do, the moment he set his eyes on "Ieft my bed," but stick his arms akimbo and ask if "my uncle" took in lodgers, and when he came to "and board," screw himself up into a most diabolical twist, and hint that she " might have been scrouged out from under the doggery table?" Consequently the "Old boss" (I don't mean the very oldest one), after administering, as was proper, a sharp box on the place where young Impudence's jaw had been, and ascertain- ing that the other culprit wouldn't be like to go security for his (the printer's) fee, concluded that such "low personalities" were beneath the notice of first class papers ike his; though lie kindly voluntecred to mako 9     38       FAMLY PAPERS AND the affair a sort of standing, unwritten text for all the grave homilies, reprimands, affectionate appeals, fatherly admonitions and " grand palavers" which he and other argus-eyed might from time to time see fit to bestow on the sex at large, irrespective of rank or class. So in the long run Biddy got off just as scot-free as any of the balance, and rather amused, if the truth must be told, at the witty little squibs, jests and jibes eliminated. "A very good wit" they all had; it hurt nobody, but good does sometimes come out of evil; thousands who never would have found time to make any exploring expedi- tions themselves, have in consequence been vastly en- lightened as to the precise whereabouts and cosmogony of WOMAN'S SPHERE. The very sight of a chart or guide-book throws all the Mrs. Mops and Miss Brooms into perfect ecstasies. "The quiet and the shade is woman's sphere, (oh, isn't that so nice and refreshing this warm  weather?) the care of her infant oqspring, her first and holiest duty! (That's rather bad, as I haven't any "young ideas" to shoot, and yours are all grown up and out of the way; but never mind, I dare say they'll have a gen- eral distribution of babies after a while.) She must re- tire from public life (to be sure we will, and glad of the chance), itsfierce struggles, angry strife, and sordid cares; its noise and glare are not for her; (now doesn't that sound so sensible and refined?) it must ever grieve her BEST FRIENDS to see her mingling in the loud- mouthed, hardhanded strife of that unloly arena!" "Dear, dear, how it must worry your poor father and husband, Carrie, for us to sit up all night writing their   la;     lOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       39 sermons and editorials, when they've overdone them- selves a little, eating and drinking for the good of hu- inanity 1!" "Well, I must say I am sick and tired playing du- enna to silks and domestics that will form improper, de- grading alliances with the vulgar scum in spite of me, making a 'a perfect figure' of myself, hunting patterns all over town, but never knew before but what brother Charlie and my Edward took it all very patiently, if the collars only happened to fit." 'And only to think what my dear departed John Imust have suffered, seeing me go to market every morn- 1ing, and how like a saint he always bore it too!

If I had only gone to the Opera now -- but I'm sure, I never meant to scandalize all my BEST FRIENDS." "And sister Harriet and I never dreamed how it hurt all their feelings, for us to look after the crop and mind the shop; while Mr. Dragonstooth was dispensing mountain dew to his thirsty followers, demonstrating the origin of trade-winds in Bunkum, and the feasibility of superseding steam and Gulf Stream by that great m motive power, and Mr. Drygoods, gone up with Mr.     40       FAMLY PAPERS AND Tripod and Rev. Dr. Decorum to the Observatory, to help Professor Tirewoman and President Count-the- skirts, take the altitude, latitude, and longitude, of Miss Virgo's drapery."  "No indade, madam, but of coorse it did; for they takes it so hard to see even the likes of me, trudging through rain and shine, to gather .up the bit sewing, or carry home the week's washing, that they always blocks up the way, and crowds us off into the gutter if they possibly can!" "Yes, but that's all over, Kate,-there's to be no more toil, and mud, and dust for us now; no parents are ever more to bring daughters into the world and leave them to shift for themselves ; no father dare to die without first providing them at least one husband and two children apiece; no helpless young mother to be left with herself and family to provide for; no selfish, monopolizing spouse, dream of making his exit before looking up a successor; no stupid, obstinate, domineer- ing, or worthless, unprincipled incumbrance, to force the weaker vessel to breast life's surges alone, or with some ignorant, reckless, gambling, drunken pilot at the helm; no faithless young lover to take himself off and leave his intended to wear the willow; no true-hearted one to wing his flight to a brighter sphere and bequeathe her ie cypress!

In short, there's nothing more for us to do, but expand our own graces in the serene atmosphere of domestic life, smile on our husbands, and nurse infant seraphs with folded wings, until they get high enough to draw maps of Woman's Sphere, on pulpit cushions and three-legged stools, and sketch designs for that monument we are going to build to the inventors of the same." Well, and thin, bless their dear souls, it won't be Kathleen O'Do-or-die that'll be withholding this con- thribution to that same;" but just at this identical moment, there came a sound "so full of woe," that every one knew instinctively it must be the summons from some ill-boding old raven, or ominous "Scrich-owl" (pretty birds of wisdom they are), which having elected itself Purveyor-General to the wants, moral, social, con- jugal, and intellectual, of Messieurs Backwoods and Rising-generation long before young Backwoods and Rising-generation knew any thing where they were or what they wanted, now called for a draft of "Twenty i  Thousand" educationists, immediately; and intimated its     42       FAMLY PAPERS AND pretty clearly that 'FIFTY must be had," and the con- script renewed "every three years." Mothers wept, daughters fainted, and even ancient spinsters folded their hands in blank despair! A few gallant spirits, however, with that calm steady light in the eye, that you would follow any where, to the van of a forlorn hope, flung themselves into the breach, declar- ing they would die at their posts sooner than be dragged one inch from WOMAN'S SPHERE.  A few more loyal subjects rallied at length, and memorialized the CONSER- VATORS; setting forth the extreme hardships of the case, the imperious tone, and despotic nature of the Ukase, and imploring them "to raise the siege and put their disciples in immediate and inalienable enjoyment of their own loved ideal!" A majority seemed to think some sort of transmigration or pilgrimage still inter- vened; but Mrs. Masterly-Inactivity sat quietly down, vowing "that if they chose to bring it round, it was all very well, but for her part, she. shouldn't budge' a soli- tary foot," and Mrs. Speak-her-mind, gave it as her opinion, " that it wasn't to be found this side Mahomet's Paradise, unless it lay in doing what each and every individual man in the universal world wanted done, and didn't want, to do.

If they never do, and 'can't even get themselves off their hands, no how,' as Crab says, rather conclude that wasn't their " mission." Suppose the Missionators don't exactly mean them to pounce upon husbands, ' after the manner of the tribe of Ben- jamin,' or help themselves to children 'any how?' Of course not; but hope, ma'am, you don't expect the free and enlightened to consider them female critters WOMEN?

Number One, CHAIRS, half dozen, rosewood and ma- hogany, spring-seat and cane-bottom; Number Two, one Windsor, two cane-bottom, all very common. Num- ber One, CARPET good, good of its kind, and in good preservation-not the slightest occasion for a score of Secession and Woman's Right newspapers to interdict an unholy alliance offensive and retentive between it and the soles of your shoes. Number Two, medium Scotch, judging from remoter parts, the more contiguous being so patriotically attached to the soil of their coun- try, that, like other patriots, their precise stripe and color is a little dubious.

Mem. Convenient place to sweep other papers, and all sorts of trash-saves labor! Number One, MOSQUITO-BARS, best lace, exquisitely [j  white, tent style, suspended per centre, its graceful i  folds spread out at night without any hint of yours, and j  thrown back by day overhead of low French lounge bed-  stead, where you can get on and off just as easy as not.

If young, hale and active, you can take a flying leap, and light somewhere near the middle; if not, just shove a trunk or two alongside; and you'll climb up after a while, may be. Number One, COUNTERPANE, finest Marseilles, changed once a week, if you stay so long; sheets and pillow- slips twice ditto, and oftener, if a drop of tea, or speck of any- kind, happens to bedim their spotless sheen. i  Mattress, new and fresh, double-spring, and very best j          3     50       FAMLY PAPERS AND quality, that nothing but a guilty conscience could pos- sibly make lie hard, if you should try by any fair means twenty-three hours out of twenty-four; and all made to fit the bedstead and each other so exactly, you can't get them out of sorts and "all up in a mess," do what you will. Oh, you may haul and pull, and twist and screw and turn and tumble, it's no use, there they are. Num-x her Two, old dimity "cover" basted, darned, dirty and dingy; sheets, &c., common cotton, the same dark- colored white, only "a little more so;" setting you right off, if the least bit metaphysical, speculating on the probable prices of soap and water, and how many one dozen ironings are equivalent to any one washing, in that "first-class" establishment. Bed, about as elastic as the "soft side of a plank ;" but if wise, and not feel- ing about as amiable as a porcupine at bay, you won't carry your investigations into other people's domestic concerns much further; indeed, there's no occasion to look. Pillows, twenty by nine inches, or thereabouts, but not very peripatetic, considering how much they have already outgrown their cases, their excursions (and those of their -adjuncts) being generally bounded by big trunk on one side, and bureau on the other; unless mosquitoes are " very bad," in which case Betty or Bridget will probably find them somewhere about the room, or just out of the window. Number One, CENTRE-TABLE mahogany, with hand- some cover and Bible; wardrobe, side-table, bureau and washstand rosewood dike bedstead); the latter with marble-tops (Italian), to match hearth and mantel-piece. Furniture of washstand, &c., &c., all complete, double   Jix OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.           51 sets; wares, china, fine and white, full complement, i made to order, and nothing wanting. Number Two, wardrobe and centre-table among the missing; bedstead sycamore; bu'reau mahogany face, and respectable glass, otherwise very ordinary, and much neglected. Wash- stand and' side-table common deal, painted divers colors, to correspond with every thing, where nothing looks like any thing else, nor any two like each other. Furniture of washstand, one hard, dark towel per diem, with nearly half a set of common white and motley delf, minus a top here, bottom therej and handle somewhere else,-looking, for all the world, like trophies won in the grand scramble, after a general smash-up in some old crockery concern. Side-table, rather hors du combat, and shoved back out of the way into a dark corner; but if you want to eat, or write, just help that choice collec- tion to emigrate; put one foot into the soap-stand (there's no cover, nor soap bigger than a wafer, to hurt or hinder), the other into the washbowl, and make yourself comfortable. They are quite clean now, you know, though I'm afraid you don't read your Bible as much as you should, or you'd remember, that " evil communications corrupt good manners," and not suffer that little finger-brush of yours to scrape acquaintance with all the coarse wedgewood and dirty stone-china in the country. Don't tell me there isn't any; haven't you got one of your own, I should like to know? And, be- sides, what right have you to go about compromising the dignity of the toga, by enacting the "old woman;" who got so much dirt by sweeping up once a year, that ,sX     52       FAMLY PAPERS AND she wondered " what upon airth people did do with it all when they cleaned up every day?"     , N.

If the establishments were large, and yielded, in proportion as much dust, dirt, lint and feathers, as  I've seen on and under some tables, beds and bureaus lately (I don't mean yours now, Number Tw'o), I sus- pect they must have to employ a special train for its transportation; but that's a mere speculation.  Number One, wheel round, turn a crank on the wall, and it's just as certain as " manifest destiny," that somebody 'll come up before you've half a chance to for- get .what you wanted, looking so neat and cheerful, po-  lite, and perfectly respectful, that you can't possibly  speak cross, or feel ill-natured, if you want to ever so much. Number Two, pretty fair cord and tassel, where you are welcome to exercise your patience and muscles  all day, if you like-though I don't know so well about  that, either, for when Paddy and Sukey can't stand "that confounded bell" any longer, it's a chance if some i greasy, slatternly, blubber-lipped darky, or raw Celt-  innocent of Anglo-Saxon as a Shanghai of high Latin-,- doesn't come up looking shillalahs and vinegar-cruets at  you, as much as to say, "I'll tache ye better manners, :i sir, nor to be ringing me up any more, disthurbing the  swatest nap, or the natest reel in the world;" and I  reckon you  on't, if you can help it. . But a word to  you, Number One.

Ver4umn   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       53 sap-Number Two, you see, understands this matter rather better. Number One, FARE, every luxury that sea and land, capital and skill, can command; got up in every con- ceivable style but a bad or indifferent one, as if to prove tlat it's not high living, but gormandizing,-not rich cooking, but bad cooking, that makes people sick. For desserts, the whole science of pastry and confectionery illustrated. Prelude,f resh bills of fare three times a day; accompaniment, music to aid digestion. Number Two, half-boiled edibles for the vegetarian; raw enough to cook, and come again; huge masses of fish, flesh and fowl for the carnivorous, with lobsters, shrimps (and, for aught I know, toads, frogs, snails, centipedes, and other fresh-water reptiles) yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow, by way of variety. Dessert, sugar and lard-lard, su- gar, and rice, slightly disguised with flour, and other va- riations. Music (about six hours every day), knife-and- fork prelude, plate-rattle chorus and gong interlude; and tin-pans and callothumpions " hide your diminished heads," you can't shine again after that gong! Bill of Fare (once a day if you insist), a regular veteran in small type epaulettes, and most magnificent pen-flour- ishing "continuations," that mean exactly what they don't say; so if you fancy Irish potatoes, invaluable in a state of siege, where lead and bullets are exhausted, just mark " green peas," or "corn ;"-underscore "broiled chicken," and you'll probably get a huge chunk of black- looking meat, swimming in a whole plate-no, saucer, full of beef, or mutton tallow, but not so much as a little finger-napkin to bless yourself withal.

Once, when some hungry " vally- de-sham," under-scullion, or out-door sub of a by-gone dynasty, cried lustily for " more pap " in behalf of his famishing wife and children, then who but you was the very first man to come forward, declaring that although constitutionally and teetotally opposed to that kitchen cabinet and the whole menage, you could not and would not harden your heart against such pathetic appeals to charity; and forthwith set up a contribution-box, and reported " a brass button, rusty nail, and pewter pap- spoon" as the result of your humane exertions?

Without wishing to broach any new heresy, or flatter you in the least, I must say, that all things considered, newspapers are, I think, rather an item in modern liter- ature, and on the whole I like some of them.

No, no, " mine ancient," it's out of fashion now, and " with all your faults I love you still" too well for that; and besides it takes my aunt Betsey, who hasn't the advantage of being a half-breed and knowing how to shoot all round the tree, and from every leaf and thorn of a crabtree chapporal, to do those sort of things.

If we don't go to church, or trouble ourselves about such things at all, then we are a set of hardened repro- bates or graceless Gallios; if we do, it's as like as not only to see our betters do the devotions, hear that their Maker is going to take them to heaven in spite of them- selves, and send us to perdition because we can't get there in spite of him, for all of which we are exhorted to love him ver4 dearly, and praise him devoutly, be cause he has made us to hate him most cordially and be punished everlastingly.

Well, that's NEWS-the innocent Mr. Public will be immensely scan- dalized, for he knows, "A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city ;" but "MOTHER, is that D-O-D," or only one of the burning and shining lights of that tongs-and-telescope philanthropy, "Which sighs o'er life's victims, their sorrows and sin, When they're quite out of reach, or wear a black skin; And mourns o'er the heathen, their blindness and wrongs, But if heathen comes in, just picks up the tongs?" Don't begin to know, or care, who you are, Mr. Ice- berg Supercilious, any more than I know for certain who, or what Fanny Fern. is, or am green enough to I  suppose she's any nearer to precisely what you or she represent, than she would be less likely than you, master "Hyacinth," or any other honorable member of the "mutual admiration (or vituperation) society," to turn up her nose at a new competitor; but any thing for a text, you know-she and your critique will do, for want of better. And now, don't you feel your moral sense and per- sonal dignity (two parts self-conceit, one part code conventionaD a little outraged, and your propriety pulse a little quickened, by her telling how nicely Aquafortis swallows Uppertenny's sugar-plums, and straightway becomes eau-de-sucre?

The old car has, on the whole, made pretty respectable progress, indeed I may as well own, quiteflattering, but one WASHNGTON once said, "that if defeated in the lowlands, he should cross over the Alleghanies!" Well, the Alleghanies are there still, I take it, and it must be discouraging, very, to see whole armies of interrogation-points popping away at you for every individual impertinence you can put down. I actually do pity you, for how mortified you must have been (knowing Adam's sons to be your brethren), when they would keep repeating " nOW Is THS?" when Fanny Fern, the existence, was so unequivocally claimed and proclaimed, by one of the very last to recognize Fanny Fern the chrysalis. Had Eve's daughters had half as much undignified curiosity, their mouths and eyes had all been propped wide open too, with exclamations; for really it was " passing strange,"-considering that for erring woman there is no forgiveness or redemption this side the grave-that one, who " didn't 'LOSE HER R ELA- TIONS ' till she lost her own self-respect," (you know you said it, some of you, and so do I,) should be thus pub- licly and voluntarily reinstated in the family register.   OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       87 I know, too, how gladly you'd "help the Lord kill Jemmy," Jenny, and every mother's son and daughter bent on getting to the root of Fern Leaves, whether it enures to her or your glorification, or not; but it's "no use," you might pull out all their tongues, chop off all their pens and right hands, and they'd still con- trive some way to make them  work, and evince that "my daughter Floy" hadn't so entirely engrossed all "vivid imagination," that they couldn't fancy a hun- dred disgraceful things implied in a woman's loss of her own "SELF-RESPECT." Were fancy any less likely than fact, to put "a little too much red in the brush," it would of course be very ungenerous to sketch the moral portrait of a dying enemy even, indeed I could not, for when God lays on his hand, mine is off; and otherwise it's by no means certain I should think him worth the powder and shot it would take to riddle him; but the converse being true, and it being also said (and never disputed that I know) that "Earth has no pang like love to hatred turned, Or hell a fury, like a woman scorned," you may cry "Hush" and "Bis-till," till you're hoarse, nobody cares. Fanny knows very well what kept up the Fern epidemic, and you can't silence the voice of inquiry, or annihilate the instinct of self-preservation. The " blue hen's chickens" will do their own scratching, "any way you can fix it," and who are you, any how, Mr. Would-be-cock-of-the-walk, that you should think to prevent it? j     88       FAMLY PAPERS AND Oh, an editor, eh! Well, that's no great things- we might have been an editor too, once upon a time, and no promotion either, could we only have made up our minds ("we" have a right to at least two) to say, "Brother Tripod " to the likes of you, when it often goes so very hard with us to put "Dear Sir " at the beginning of a letter, and "r-e-s-c-t-l-y," at the end, -knowing all the while that we don't mean any such thing; but seeing we are just as good as one of the craft, (rather better it's to be hoped than "lots of them,") and abundantly able to put you through, with or without the dignificado, or Lindley Murray's leave when to take it up or lay it down, you might just as well own up and be done with it. Come now, you set yourself up to enlighten " out- side barbarians," be honest once, (" you know you never was afore,") and tell a body what it really does take, more than two or three judicious failures, or one splendid defalcation, and the otium cum dignitate of a long con- tinental tour, to constitute your ideal RESPECTABILITY? Do you think any woman has any proper " self-respect," that don't always send Livery to answer your ring, with a silver waiter, at the, very least, for your card? Do you think she ever had any to lose, if she can't, at this present, live up to five or ten thousand a year, at the very lowest? And, "honor bright," do you fairly and fully believe she is a woman at all, if,compelled to ap- ply any talent God has given her, to any useful purpose under heaven? I don't!

"Isn't it perfectly unbearable (" only you must bear it") that they won't listen to reason, and leave off breathing, with dinners, diamonds, and operas-that not even their own blood relations can be allowed to find rope, razor, or morphine, and take them all quietly off, before committing such awful rents in escutcheon as no "aristocratic darning needle" in the world could fairly mend? Isn't it a sin and shame, that after get- ting up a bran-new coat-of-arms, and sacrificing to the graces; your sublimities can't begin to show off, without having or and argent besmudged and begrimed with their sackcloth and blouse-perfectly infamous, that you can't presume to put on the High-Mightiness, t without having somebody flinging their disgustability in F ,     90       FAMLY PAPERS AND your faces? I really don't know what is to be done in such premises I Suppose you try, legislating away the consan- guinity! I've known moral obligation very summarily discharged by that economic process; and when the impudent nuisances come to want help, instead of get- ting, or giving it, perhaps you can't do better. Should the unreasonable malcontents object, (as it's as like as not they will, though I shouldn't,) you can impeach the integrity of family records, and denounce them as illegitimates, or impostors. If they don't take them- selves out of your daylight after that, I don't quite like to advise extreme measures, such as indictments for swindling, or vagrancy; but if worst does come to worst, always remember to cry "lMad dog!" before shooting down your enemy's poodle. Not that I expect any thing so proononc of your serene platitude as pal- pable interference,-oh no, that would never do-it would compromise "dignity ;" and, besides, you might "catch a Tartar." If there's a wrinkle in your rose- leaf, don't open your mouth, or offer to touch it, but just wince, or turn up your nose, and the work, though never so dirty, is sure to be done; for don't esprit du corps teach every man that truth and justice are nothing to the interests of his order? Of course it does; and the more these are imperilled from within, the more it imports him to put on an injured, above- all-suspicion air, hug the traitor, and hang the accuser.

It knows, too, how manly, and honest, and high-  minded, and, withal C0hristian a thing it is, to sneer away a woman's good name, in innuendoes, specifying nothing, and implying every thing derogatory! Saying, "for instance, lost her SELF-RESPECT," meaning, very possibly, unlimited income, and nothing else-except to have the uninitiated translate it, " no better than she should be,"-a phrase, which all that are, know ought to immortalize its author, come what will of your snub- bings. However, if it's only a woman, and you've "the s better part of valor," perhaps you're safe enough after all; but do you honestly believe fraud, falsehood, and wrong, the best safeguards of honor and justice?

Does the anointed priest always take a lie in his right hand with the cup of salvation? Is the tem- ple, indeed, so baseless that it must totter to its fall at the first echo of a halting tread? Is integrity a cheat -is there nothing in life but the profoundly unreal? Are friendship and dissimulation, principle and pre- varication, piety and pretension, all one and the same? Earth has faith in their duality, even yet-SUBLIME  FAITH, in a deep, pure, strong vitality, that has sur- vived the contact of many a foul putrescence-that need not fear the probe and the scalpel! Have you NO FAITH to give in return? How much longer will you wrap the old charlatanry round the gan- grene, whose rankness smells to heaven-raise your old cat-calls, "Infidel," "'Anti' " "Radical,"-persecute right with vindictive might, and think to hoodwink God and man into a belief of your own infallibility! How much longer will it take you to find out that you can't lay your opera kids on the great, beating pulse of humanity, and say, "WE ARE THE MEN "-- Peace-be still?"

However, if she does find out at last that she's somc- thing more and better than a mere parloi toy, and is unselfish and truehearted, humane and affectionate enough to wish to help her poor, weary mother, why then, God bless and help you, child, go and do it; but don't swallow any more of that " oily gammon " about     "4       FAMLY PAPERS AND its helping Yon to a husband, if it does come from Ar- canum  and Sanctorum.

"A mother with a family of six or twelve children is the veriest slave on the earth, and from day to day, for twenty or thirty years, her energies are overtaxed till she has no vitality for the daughter, nor, brains for the son; it is all consumed in toil, and watching, and anxiety. A race of mnen will never be born in America till this load of care and slavish toil is removed from the mothers who rear the race; the slave and the brute in gesta- tion have more care and attention than our Northern mothers!"

This, of course, implies the aid of dress, in its most elegant and becoming-no, I'll take that back, for "the beauty of the fitness of things " is indispensable to elegance, "taste," and "propriety," to the becoming, and neither is essential here, the acts, pitted against the critiques of the carping old cynics,(and would be thought highly moral and refined observers,) themselves being witness; so I shall merely say, " in its most fashionable and expensive style." Do this, and the prize is yours, despite all the "old saws," ex cathedra, and lay preach- ments, prosy, story-telling moralists, and moralizing bores, in existence; for with his Alpha and Omega, the beginning, middle, and end of all his thoughts and aspirations all before him, how can mortal man fail to kneel to Sylph, whose surroundings fascinate his eye, whose genial sprites fill his -mouth with all good things? IMPOSSIBLE! And when you've got your game (or he's got you) safely tagged, it won't be long, I'm think- ing, before you'll begin to believe, that that Dr. D. really did have some " reasoning powers," or at least perceptions, with all his crochets.

WE have it, says an eye-witness, upon the very best authority, that a peaceable, law-abiding citizen-one of those comfortable, nothing-so-easy philosophers, who bear another's woes " with such sublimity, that all the world exclaims, 'what magnanimity!'"-was lately "talking good," and holding forth condescendingly and commonsensically, to that legitimized butt of all com- pos-mentis-dom, a victimized, struggling author. Now, this particular one, be it understood, had- after once fairly reaching shore, under circumstances said to have made it "an achievement worthy to be recorded in letters of gold on after life," been ruth- 12     134       tAMTLY PAPERS AND lessly caught, and flung back into the sea of oblivion-- shouts of victory ringing in one ear, taunts of failure hissed into the other-by the very humane, especial, and disinterested friends, who, after sufficiently testing the bantling's ability to survive the enforced literary felo-de-se of sales by author, fancied, perhaps, that it would do all the better, if parental encumbrance could only be got out of the way altogether; but somehow, the more they tried, just so much the more it couldn't. There was no earthly excuse for this indomi- table perversity; the world itself was just as obliging as need be, and could, as the tenacious le trop well knew, muster sufficient fortitude, any time, to draw out its pocket-handkerchief, say Ah, indeed! and resign itself to the loss with most exemplary composure; but no, the world might put up its cambric, or cry its eyes out, if it liked, from pure vexation,-it was no go. Well, the world does put up with a good deal in the long run, but there are some imposings on good nature which it can't stand-some points beyond which human endurance will not go; and even our placid, imperturbable, unoffending citizen felt himself in duty bound to remonstrate. So he fell, of course, to dis- coursing very sapiently, abstractly, and originally, on the idle folly of any but a very distinguished author's * ever having recourse to the pen, especially if it was that or nothing, in a world like this, so teeming with books and swarming with literateurs.

And as if that wasn't enough to horrify the " un- terrified" even, she must coolly aver " that she had herself been on the planet called earth ever since she could remember-had as many eyes and ears as most folks, and, if she hadn't, had heard that same story, to the best of her knowledge and belief, at least three thousand times; and seeing that Literary effort wasn't, after all, such a very unprecedented and unheard-of atrocity, didn't know but she had just as good a right to " come in" as any of the balance. Would like to know, though, how many of the " very distinguished" ever got to be so very distinguished before Mrs. Grundy, and " all the rest of mankind," ever had any chance, to 1  speak of, to see whether they ever could be distin- guished? As for their suffrages, now that they were l     136      FAMLY PAPERS AND "distinguished," they didn't count-it was so easy, as all the world knew, to pull the wool over the eyes of the very first grade; and for grades number two, three, and so along down, they'd let any fiat pass.

And if "keener than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child," how fearfully sullied and dim must be the fine gold of that original image, in the wayward child of a Heavenly Father, that can receive his boun- ties with indifference, and turn away from the earthly benefactor with bitterness and scorn, allied to "envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness." Such things have been, such things will be-but falter not for that, "wax not weary in well doing," ye to whom it is given to know how much more blessed it is "to give than to receive." Do we so use the gift that is in us as never to abuse it? Is our gratitude for the greater good so perfect, that we can brook no flaw in that for the less? "The gallants laugh, and fling him gold, and he gathers it with a curse;" but was that man wholly ungrateful? No, for "he went to share it with the beggar that had pitied him." Man is not "all evil,"-if we are human, what right have we to demand perfection? Should we not rather look well to the spirit that is in us?, It may be that in almsgiving we haye forgotten charity; that our zeal is sometimes officious, that heeding too little the flush- ing cheek and quivering nerve, which should have     "4      FAMLY PAPERS AND warned us that our step was on forbidden ground, we have pressed too rudely into unwilling confidence, until our well-meant kindness seemed  impertinent and supercilious; that we have not always remembered that "the race is not always to the swift, or the battle to the strong," and lectured, when we should have sym- pathized; that we have sometimes forgotten that  "God loveth a cheerful giver," and clung too long and closely to his gifts, as to something won by our own "sword and our bow;" or it may be that we have en-  joyed "the luxury of doing good" with too keen a relish-a relish more human than Christian; that over all, and under all, our honest intent, and justly conscious ability to rule (in the man) wisely and well for others, there has been-unseen, perhaps, by our- selves, but visible enough to others-a strong propen- sity to rule, not a mere vulgar love of domineering, or " insolence of office," but too deep a yearning "to feel power palpably in ourselves," by seeing others sue-  cumb to its influence; that hidden away somewhere  in the secret recesses of a heart, "deceitful above all things," is too much of that " love of patronizing one's I equalgor betters," which a satirical casuist pronounces  "the better half of human sympathy ;"-that this it is which so often makes us give, freely and cheerfully, when no amount of special pleading or self-flattery can make it any thing else but plain, downright " chari- ty," what we will not give in employ or reward of honest industry and talent, or less stinte& wages to humbler need; and even when, ministering with the most delicate tact to human want, we may have but   OF2ICIAL DOCUMENTS.      145 half realized the exigency for aid, to secure some pro- mised good, or avoid some untold ill; and forgot in our own convenience, the bitter misery of "hope de- ferred," until our gentlest ministrations lost half their power to soothe and bless. If we have forgotten that "man is of three natures, requiring all for charity "-if, unchecked by the rigid lip and husky voice, the averted eye, and tardy reply, we have galled some high-toned, morbidly sensitive spirit almost beyond endurance, by a regular cate- chizing, which even a Barnum's coarse sensibilities and easy morality could feel " enough to make any man swear, without kissing the Bible "-if our own impa- tient tone or altered bearing has betrayed how ill we brook the evasive answer, or more specific hinthat there may be bounds, which our curiosity has neither right nor need to pass-the slightest dissent from our plans, or want of implicit confidence in us-or, if we have held "the cup of promise to the lip," until its contents lost their richest flavor, what right have we to complain, that after all our unquestionable and un- questioned kindness of general aim, all our actual fa- vors, so little gratitude is felt or shown? It may be that the recipients have been reminded of them, too plainly and often,-that through our own hu man imperfection grating too harshly on its counterpart in theirs, we have converted what might have been grati- tude, into a painful sense of obligation; for it is not the better, but more sordid nature, that can bless the largesse which strikes down that "self-respect which is worth more to man than money." The good Dr.     "6      FAMLY PAPERS AND Young, the conscientious Dr. Johnson, could feel that even gold and patronage " might come too late;" and if we steadfastly close our eyes to the wretchedness we "-cannot choose but know," until the want becomes squalid, and the misery abject, then is all our fancied charity no better than refined selfishness-a mere syba- rite feeling, that cannot brook the slovenly, unmannered corpse of animal suffering "between the wind and its nobility." What, NO CHARITY in my half supporting that sick woman ever since her drunken husband got into limbo? No charity in any sending a shroud, and bread, and blankets, and fuel, to that troublesome fellow, that bothered me so with his "little bill?"In my sending drugs, and flannel, and broken victuals, to my old laun- dress, all the while she was laid up with that tiresome rheumatism? In my bailing that fatherless boy I was going to get a place, out of the watch-house, and giv- ing him a dollar besides?

It is at best only that purblind humanity, which busies itself with the mangled and dying of the present concussion, but takes no thought, lifts no finger, to avert the like catastrophe from the on-coming train. This, however, is not meant chiefly for those who presumptuously set the lesser charity above the greater, and heedlessly or wilfully neglect, while raising the fallen, that truer mercy which "prevents the foot that is ready to slide." No, it is for those mercifully spared, thus far, that fearful gift of second sight, "to see all others' faults and feel our own," which is born so often of a finely organized nature, and long discrepancy be- tween purse and position,-and who would gladly do more and better in the service of God and humanity. Many such warm-hearted, humble-minded Chris- tians there are, among the lofty, and the lowly, earnest, willing workers in God's vineyard, who wonder, and grieve that they so often fail,-grieve, not so much for the ingratitude shown to themselves, as Him whose servants they are; but deeply grieve, when they look around on the mighty work to be done, and back on the I    OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.       149 year that is gone, with its record on high; that with all their noble purpose. and large benevolence, "so little" has been accomplished. BUT BE NOT DISCOUR- AGED. Though very pleasant it is to read in the dewy lash and kindling eye, that our presence is hailed with a blessing, our footsteps followed by a prayer, it is not for that the Christian labors. "The blessing of him that was ready to perish" may never swell out in all its richness on his earthly ear; but he knows who has said, that " the cup of cold water," given in his name, shall not " lose its reward." The sinful, the ignorant, "the poor," are with us still; a new unsullied year is ours, let us welcome and hallow the gift, by seeking earnestly of the Giver more of that charity which "thinketh no evil; " more faith in God, more faith in humanity. There is more good with the ill, more grati- tude perhaps to God and to ourselves, than we deem. We are not omniscient-we may after all have misin- terpreted its indications. "The heart will, aye must, leap kindly back to kindness ;" but it is a harp of a thousand strings, and many a chord has lost its tone. More discord than melody may often follow our careless hand, or rude, unskilful touch; but there is one touch that never fails, one hand that " giveth liberally and up- braideth not;" let us turn then, meekly and prayer- fully to Him, for a higher wisdom and nicer skill, that we may yet be the " humble instruments in his hands of tuning that harp anew, to sing the praises of God and the Lamb."

There, for instance, all common candor, if not good syntax, required the use of who instead of what. But where, in the name of "gumption," have you been mummyizing, all this time, my dear Casper Hauser, number two, never to have heard before, how unblushingly, public and private Secretaries proclaim their own infamy, (contrary to Law and Statute, which require no man to criminate himself,) by publishing, stolen copies of papers to which they had access but no right; nor of other " indivi- duals," " vexatiously and injuriously," detaining docu- ments in transitu, like J.

There's one set of them, and a certain, regular, old hard case, leading, to my certain knowledge, such a dance between the two, that Mrs. Gundy, Mr. World and his wife, and " all .the rest of mankind," stand, a pretty fair chance to get all the remarkabilities of that epitaph, "learned and conned by rote," long before they get a chance to recprd it, (the more's the pity,) but then, "Before one does engage a foe, 'Tis well he should his strength and courage know."

It's a pity some one of them don't, for that's precisely what people mean; and only think what a saving of time and ink it would be to write autlorsvanity; the pre- fixes, of course, representing all the self-conceit and two-fifths the vanity. That may be all very true; but if possession does give the " eleven points in law"-and unquestioned ascription, from time immemorial, amount to pretty much the same thing-we are not going to concede the twelfth without putting in a demurrer in behalf of some other human bipeds, unjustly defrauded of their fair share in the proprietorship.

And hard enough they are, too; for if all the astronomers in existence were to vow and declare that its eccentric luminosity had been starring it about somewhere ever since they could remember, some people would never believe that a comet was a comet, if it had n't been blazing away right before their own face and eyes the whole blessed time; ori if they did, comprehend that some "distinguished" authorships might be some like those old ones, little talked of until they are near. Editors, on the other haid, are sometimes con- ceited enough to think, or at least pretend, that a good-sized, readable book is n't worth as much as their comments, and so by "masterly inactivity" cheat themselves out of a positive advantage, and the honor of the author's acquaintance, lest he should chance to reap some little incidental profit. It's to be hoped the demented are rare; but we have known instances of some such strange delusion and miserly apprehension. Others, more courteous and less niggardly, though not a whit the less overween- ing, coolly aver that they have "complimented" him with a notice, as if every individual page of his book had n't cost as much labor of hand and brain as the, filling up of a few square inches, more or less, of hi; "valuable space" with the reprint of an old notice, pertinent and well put, perhaps, at the time it was written; and a few'of those astute and very original lines, signifying that they, the lords Tripod, had n't read the book on their tables, (it might keep them, as well as their betters, awake at unseasonable hours, }     168      FAMLY PAPERS AND you know,) but having looked at the type and felt of the paper, would venture to commend it, because others had. Others, again-and these are still more hopelessly far gone in that absurd hallucination- actually hold out their hands, like so many shame- less, impudent beggars, asking even us " to oil their palms," just as if "caustic" and "attic salt" wouldn't be a great deal better for "itching" ones, and theirs did n't need them- much more than "'Ilthy lucre"- more by token that failing, as they always will, to get that or any other filth from us, their all-grasping firgers still stick fast to our backs, as if they hadn't the fear of the Eighth Commandment before their eyes, or any other enactment against the more atro- cious thefts called swindling. Perhaps, though, it is from some little lingering sense of decency and consciousness that our books, having once touched pitch, must be defiled, and consequently of no fur- ther use to us. Thank God, we don't often meet face to face with any thing quite so mean, the ma- jority of their corps being, so far as we know, fully as honorable, able, and compos as other folks, to say the least; still there are living specimens of such extreme stultification. Then there is the "talking-good," matter-of-fact class of people, with no end to its number and vari- ety; and very excellent, kind-hearted people they are, too, many of them; still, one cannot well help thinking some of them a little supercilious occa- sionally. For example, when some poor wretch of an author-for his, it must be remembered, is the class against whose monopoly of "authorsvanity"   EX-OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.     169 we are protesting--has no resource but the pen, no , means to await Bibliopolist pleasure, and is forced, for lack of a better, to be his own publisher and salesman too, it must be rather trying to be told over and over so graciously by every one of them, thatthey should think it would be better to have the regular publishers do it for him, just as if he did n't know that as well as they. Not particularly pleasant, either, to be virtuallycalled to account for it, even if he has, as the editors sometimes allege, " stood by the South honestly and fearlessly, while others of half the talent were winning fortunes by covering it with insult and abuse." Serves him right, though, the consummate sim- pleton; did n't he know the South always preferred to encourage and sustain its assailants? And sup- posing he has, as they say, " won literary reputation without publishers' aid, in defiance of sectional jealousy and the universal prejudice against sales by author;" what business had he, the daring, self-willed rebel, to fly in the face of that autocracy and this one-ideaed institution? No wonder the mentors think it necessary to administer grave reprimands, under the form of patronizing suggestions, which, if not always new, might be very useful, if only practical and accessible. And no wonder they keep him continually filing declarations of penury and isolation, think the vindication but half satisfactory, and insist on putting him through a series of expos- tulations, cross-examinations, hypotheses, and re- joinders, not exactly such as Barnum said "were enough to make any man swear, without kissing the     170      FAMLY PAPERS AND Bible," but very like some leading questions we have to answer (about three hundred and sixty-five times every year) much as follows, videlicit: I suppose you can't do much sewing? Well, sir, we do contrive to get through pretty much all the little we have to do, after a fashion, and did, even when having to fasten the seam at both ends, and pile up books and pillows to sustain the hand under it. Suppose that on an average we might, in the course of the day, sew on about a dozen or so of those "strings and buttons" the newspapers make so much fuss about, if any of the buttonless would only give us a liberal salary therefor, and a maid to thread the needles when our free hand refuses to help. 'Vell, there's teaching. Yes, we know it. Couldn't you try that, in some private family, at least? Never again, madam, unless we get dishonest enough to defraud some poor child of far more than the few hundreds taken out. of the father's pocket; for money lost can be replaced-lost time, never. Iap- py, though, to oblige you, or any friend of yours that wants an invalid to nurse, instead of a walking compendium of all the ologies and accomplishments that fit a young lady for any thing but the actual duties of life,'and would like to pay us for not teach- ing every thing we don't know, and lack the strength and skill to impart, if we did. Ladies sometimes edit papers; (so we have heard;) wouldn't that suit you better? Possibly. And the next time any capitalists offer to set up an editorial chair for our use, why, we are older now, if not wiser, than we were once, and shall perhaps have   EX-OFBICIAL DOCUMENTS.    171 little enough conscience left to let them run the risk. The existing tripods are all occupied, (if not well filled,) so far as we know, and even they, if one may believe the incumbents, require some phy- sique. "But they want contributors." Enough, it would seem, for some of them to have copied one of our books pretty extensively, with our permission, and changed all the signatures but one in contravention of it, lest (it is fair to infer) they should chance to help make ours " one of the names" with which they might some day have to compete. So, at least, we have heard from the far-off marquees of Fort Lara- mie; and as for the rest of them-never, when we apply, always "overstocked for a year to come." In fact, we may be very thankful if, where they don't like our Southern principles or post-mark, they merely return the MS. unopened, without the scratch of a pen to say why or wherefore, instead of insolently returning our own notes, too, after losing papers of value, and putting us and our friends to serious inconvenience to recover the residue, as do some "lords spiritual" and "lords temporal," who seem to think " that whein St. James speaks of q   visiting the fatherless and widows in their affliction, he only means such as can return the call in their own carriages."  (See Censoria Lictoria, pages 59 and 71.) So you see, sir, and madam, that we are indubi- tably "the one too many" in the world, try what and where we' will. This same world has a great m any tight places, but no sticking ones; and seeing     172      FAMLY PAPERS AND we are not quite good enough to be translated, you might as well let us "gang on;" we shall get to the end of it some day, if it is round. "For all that, I am sure it must be very. hard and dis- tressing to your refined, sensitive feelings!"Well, we have found that out, too, without the help of any- body's superior wisdom, but never did, find out that it was any the less painful for being continually re- minded of it, nor the use or humanity of preaching to a poor wretch in the water on the folly of tum- bling in, the pangs of drowning, and the hazard of drift-wood and straws; and' do verily believe one row-boat or rope would be more exhilarating than dozens of pathetic jeremiads and whole regiments of monitors, standing high and dry, hands shut and mouths wide open, doing nothing but sympathize and sermonize. Now, God forbid we should ever make light of any real sympathy, however inefficient. We could not be so base; it is too holy; though a mere wordy, supercilious "pity" -we do spurn and scorn from our very inmost soul. But do these monitors presume to snub, or dare to pity, in pure mockery, purposely to harrow up our feelings, that we may give them "a wide berth" ever after? Some of them, possibly; not many. Do they think, then, that we are too brutalized to recoil instinctively enough from exhibiting our in- firmities all over the land, "as a beggar does his. scars ;" that we never writhe under the injustice of having thus to seek patronage which comes volun- tarily to others, backed (as we are not) by publish- ers' aid, though "far inferior," if the first critics   EX-OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.    173 of the country may be allowed to decide; or that we are too stolid to feel the grave rebukes under- lying all their "lengthened sage advices?" O no, not at all, unless preeminently blessed with "eyes and no eyes." What, then? Do they suppose we rather enjoy giving an account of our actions to every "wayward clod of marl," see no indignity in having our works rejected one day, because their ability and our po- sition combined can require no such form of sale; and taken on the next in largesse, with the very probable intention of exposing them at once to the "evil report" of some child in intellect or years, to whose grade of capacity they were never intended to be adapted? Do they really fancy that we care nothing for domestic ease and rightful social appre- ciation, that we love toil and pain, neglect, humilia- tion; exposure, and aggravated physical suffering for their own sakes, or are less interested and less likely than themselves to give some thought and attention to the discovery of what would be to us (not them) some easier and better way to the glorious-privilege of being independent? O 'no! none of all these things; certainly not; but then, partly, perhaps, from dislike to having old settled prejudices unsettled, and the dear Al Sirat Arch, Respectability, quite broken down, as it might be, but for their "eternal vigilance," by some reckless foot without golden slipper, and part- ly because it is easier to scold the wrong than set them right; they do sometimes cavil when, to say the least, they might as well hold their tongues, and I     174      FAMLY PAPERS AND not discourage others; for we do protest against having .our fragile " rope" fretted away until some- body sends a life-boat, instead of merely telling us that they rather suspect there may be somebody somewhere who has one at command. Some, no doubt, would like well enough to see us well aboard, or safely moored, even-if they don't stop to lend much of a helping hand, or do forget to hail the owner; and not a few, we firmly believe, would gladly devote both time and means in any way that we could accept without degradation, were the latter only theirs. There are those, however, who, when they can't do great things in either way, and see that we are fot over fond anyhow of " praying to Hercules, in- stead of putting our own shoulder to the wheel," cheerfully do little ones to help on all they can in ours. Very dear are they to us, but very little right have they, we fear, to a place in their order. In sober earnest, we don't believe any thing but a lucky accident ever shut them in, while we were shut out, for such vagaries are surely little more common- sensical than our own. They will never make bril- liant stars in that matter-of-fact galaxy, from whose serene depths shines out for ever and ever the calm conviction that "Nature's poor, unfriended child, the bard," can by no possibility have the least par- ticle of common sense. How should he, or any of his ilk, when they have engrossed every atom of it, just as he and his, have all the authorsvanity extant? But, then, they are far more generous than he, and not only concede   EX-OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.    175 nll that without grumbling: but actually respect the injunction, "Let him that hath two coats give to him that hath none," occasionally. And only think what a blessing it is that they do vouchsafe him at times some few crumbs of benefit from their own superior endowments, and how condescending and pains- taking they must be to labor so hard to infuse some little idea of needles and schools, and editors and publishers into our poor befogged brain. And what if they had, by some strange fatuity, haunted it be- fore; if we did " know a thimble by sight, darning- needle by personal acquaintance," publishers and teaching to our sorrow? That only proves that we must be one of the very smallest and most insignifi- cant committees of black and white, not that we are one whit less commonsenseless than the finest spe- cimen of the graceless "ne'er do weels" ever seen; otherwise, we should n't dare to sport this " imperial we," as the only perquisite and memento of our editorship elect, of a possible folio. And what but the most pure, disinterested benev- olence ever could make these sublimely sagacious matter of-facts, with all the commnon-sense of the world in their keeping, so immensely amiable and graciously patronizing to us and other worthless scions of a worthless stock? Nothing on earth, that we can see, but a full-roon share of "culthorsvanity." Other varieties of the class exhibit theirs in very different ways, all quite palpable enough, though, to be detected wiithout chemical test or microscope; but it's useless to carry the investigation farther. The common-sense world has evidently been cheated     176      FAMLY PAPERS AND all this while out of its legitimate rights in that common property, and a Convention being the infalli- ble redresser of all modern grievances, we suggest that one be called immediately to take up the sub- jects of both the aforesaid monopolies, and institute a more equitable subdivision. Not being one of the strong-minded, we can't pre- side, and it will go hard with us to see our own clique despoiled of its chief possessions; but let justice be done though the skies fall-restitution must be made. Some hot-headed metaphysicians may infer that the continual, barefaced lugging in of "us" and "our experience" into this investigation is of itself. an aggravated instance of authorsvanity, and prima facie evidence that that commodity, at least, should be settled in perpetuity on its old basis. Cooler ones may deprecate their fatal facility of rushing to rash conclusions from insufficient premises, and fast members decide that it is a mere outsider's air, with little or no bearing on the general question, though gallant young ones will most likely vote that it does entitle us, individually, to double diviZ dends. Most readers will probably agree with them ; we shouldn't wonder, for some people do seei to have a " mission" to believe whatever they choose. For our part, we haven't any, nothing but a star, but that's the "star of the unconquered will," as one Longfellow, Henry W., calls it, and we believe in that sort of stars-we do; but don't believe, Mes- sieurs the authors, that you have any just right to   EX-OFFICIC  DOCUMENTS.      1" monopolize the w  ole fee-simple of AUTHORSVANITY any longer.

THs is not the place for indiscriminate praise or censure, were the former ever due to mortals; but if too much of that reckless waywardness anid wild love of adventure, so common to ardent, impulsive ?     178      FAMSY PAPERS AND natures, marred the brief, unfinished career of the victim, "tread lightly on his ashes, ye men-of genius, for he was your brother." And dearly did he pay the penalty in the blight of his early promise, and the long months and years in which "wearisome days and sleepless nights alone were his;" but O, how inexpressibly consoling to surviving friends is now the assurance that he has at last met face to face with the sainted motherwho passed away in his early childhood. And who can tell how oft the love of that Christian mother has been over and around him in the tangled chaparral, the dark and deadly morass, in blessing and in prayer? Who can tell how oft it has breathed through the hearts and voices of the living, winning the sinful, toil- worn man gently back*to bow late, but lowly and humbly, at the foot of the cross, and find, in believ- ing, "that peace of God which passeth all understand- ing ."
