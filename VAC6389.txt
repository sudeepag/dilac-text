            PREFACE. 
            IN this work the author has not attempted so great folly as a real disguise, either of himself or his friends and pupils. But he has grouped together some of the striking every-day facts of an interesting period of his life, to show that real life is all full of romance. In most respects, though there are fables in it, and he is a poor critic who can not see them, this story of Castlereagh is a true narrative. Castlereagh represents a true person, although, in the coloring and intensity of his portraiture, he is simply IDEAL. He could not represent a true model, modestly, but in ideal. 
            The many pupils of Lindenvale Institute, and the surviving though far-scattered tutors and helpers, will perceive where truth and fiction lie snugly enfolded together-where the fact has been highly fabled-where the fable is largely true, and where the foundation laid is firm or sandy. Although quick to make these discoveries, they will agree with Castlereagh that the picture here drawn, in its general outlines, has a very striking resemblance to Lindenvale Institute as it was.

            DREAMS AND REALITIES. 
             
               CHAPTER I. 
               THE DREAM. 
                
                  
                      
                        We are drifting, drifting all, 
                        As by the tides' waves driven, 
                        From head to stern; 
                        Yet, but the urn 
                        Of a shiftless, thriftless, drifting make, 
                        And drifting still, are driven, 
                        LIFE'S DRIFTERS, all! 
                     
                   
                
               ELBERT CASTLEREAGH had been settled as pastor eight years in Richmond, a rural township of New England. Of these, nearly six had been years of married life with Sarah Matilda Hayward, whom he had found and married on the banks of the sweetly flowing Raritan in New Jersey. They had two sons, John and Hobbs, and at the time of which this record speaks, John was nearly three years of age, Hobbs less than one year old. 
               Castlereagh had thus wrought, for many years, in this retired township, "going out and in" among the good people. He began to deem them weary years. And one evening, just as the twilight deepening gathered ered the day into night, he sat down in the old and easy arm-chair of his study, with any other than a cheerful, contended mind. Tired, harassed, drooping, the young pastor complained that his field was not only hard of present cultivation, but that it held out no brighter prospect in its future; a field remunerative-less of peace, of improvement, of fame, where neither great or good results would ever be developed. He sighed for a place more congenial and useful. His warmest passions were enlisted in the cause of education. Oh! could he but connect those two controlling elements of human life in one-religion and education-and from early youth lead the mind into the pure and elevating seats of moral and mental influence and refinement, it were a life, the worth to live. He long considered the question. Long and earnestly sought for an answer to the inquiry, "Do not prudential reasons and providential circumstances indicate a duty paramount to all others?" and answered half affirmatively were all the inquiries that came up in his fevered brow e'er judgment and long sober thought had weighed them well. 
               By little and little Castlereagh had become dull in his pastorate. Little did he care to make more and still richer flights in his burning and eloquent discourses. He deemed the ears dull, and the hearts hard, of those to whom they were addressed. Weary grew the walks over his much-loved parish. Sameness and tameness stamped themselves on every scene, and object, and pursuit, grinning horribly upon him. His food came tasteless to his lips, the bright eye dimmed, the dark locks hung uncombed, and wife and children, in their fond love and embraces, could not long keep him from his moods. And he resolved, (then faltered, again considered it, and then fell back on present things,) that he would accept the bright light that seemed to offer itself, and in the new and delightful parish of Linden-vale, commence, in some unostentatious way, the work which long had been to him a bright vision of hope for the land and the world. 
               "We must," he said, "have a Christian education and a pure piety secured early to the people, or farewell to all our confidences and wishes for the world." 
               Elbert was right herein, but the delusion was in thinking he himself, with his own single arm, could do the work of two; that a true and faithful pastor could also take on him the labors of an educational establishment for the young, and assume the constant care and training of an hundred opening minds; that one physical constitution, and one mind, could labor easily and long endure the cares, vexations, and excitements of the school-room and the pulpit at the same time. The bright hope of his early life had been to teach great truths to others, and to make man manly, beauty lovely, and religion graceful and all-controlling. He looked with love and with pity on the young, and sighed for their complete emancipation from ignorance, temptation, and passion. He had seen no brighter vision than this along the path he had been treading for eight years of his parochial life. What hope so great and well founded as that of permanent piety, if connected with an educated, refined, and studious mind? And he considered the toil, the self-denial, the great effort to secure it, just as inviting as the laurel-crown to him who strove for precedence in the athletic games and races. He weighed the good of a human soul against the weary effort, and it was heavy with preponderating good. 
               To disengage his thoughts from this study and its consequent result, kindly, intelligently, and calmly reasoned his beloved Sarah. Her dissuasives were as affectionately answered, and the husband, the scholar, the father, and Christian, besought her to name no more the toil and hazard, but to co-operate with him, and consummate a plan so hopeful of the most glorious and blessed results. 
               The evening dimmed still more, the stars came out, the evening chirps and songs began, and still Castle-reagh mooded. And by and by as he continued ruminating, thrown back in his chair, a gentle rap on his door seemed to reach him, and a stranger, bland, courteous, and refined, entered. Elbert would have arisen, but ere he could do so, the soft pressure of the stranger's hand on his brow repressed him, and at the same moment the incomer noiselessly glided to a seat. 
               "I have come," said he, "to soothe you." 
               "Ah!" 
                
               "Yes; I well know what it is that rests so heavily on your spirit." 
               "Then tell me-oh! tell me-is it so, can it be that I do err?" 
               "To err is human, Castlereagh. But not all of human kind do err beyond forgiveness." 
               "No; and yet my spirit can but faintly buoy itself above the flood of doubt and conviction it is launched on; and to me, sometimes, there is a fearful admonition in my doubts." 
               "These are," the stranger said, and his long pale finger pointed upward-"these are thy trials. Faith is searching in thee for her foundation. If there be in thy soul a firm rock for her feet, thou shalt soon be at rest." 
               Elbert trembled, though at what he scarcely knew. The words rung their own powerful music in his heart, and they seemed to him fitted to compose the very spirit they yet terrified. 
               He arose and looked upon the stranger. Benignity and wisdom were impressed upon his countenance, and he became more assured. 
               "Shall I go forward," he inquired, "or shall I cast off the thought of good I would do for the reality of that which, though I might, I do not?" 
               "Would you see the stars, the moon, the sun itself in clouds? Would you, if it lay in your power, pour the desolating monsoon over the desert, or water it as with the river of God?" 
                
               "True, true. I would fertilize and bless; I would do all that lies in my power-" 
               "Power! Is there not power pledged to thee? 'My grace is sufficient for thee.'" 
               "But consider, the promise may not be to those who with open eyes do err." 
               "It is heaven's great guaranty to such as can, in all good doing, believe. If, then, there is in thee more unbelief than faith, beware lest thy present doing leave thee on the quicksands of works. There is no good in works alone." 
               "I have labored here with my flock these eight comfortless years-no, I will not say all comfortless and friendless, but with little in them of deep sympathetic gladness, hope, and joy. I pine for a field where, beginning at the foundation, I may build a goodly edifice of faith and love to the glory of God, and show to man how pure and perfect may be on earth the Church of Jesus Christ the Lord, purchased by His own most precious blood." 
               "Castlereagh, that noble impulse has been given thee. It urges you on; it denies you peace in the condition you now occupy. It is the will of Heaven. Why do you linger?" 
               "My wife, my best friends hold up admonitory fingers." 
               "And your own conscience-?" 
               "Bids me obey my impulses." 
               "Conscience, that never yet erred, you resist, and to the minor object subject the major. Can you not believe? Can you not put forth that power which is pledged and given thee, and overcome? They only who gain the prize receive the crown. Thy wife, thy children, thy friends, will all yet rejoice in thy conquest, and admire the force, and wisdom, and benevolence of thy heart." 
               Elbert reached forth his hand, the stranger grasped it. "Then you do from this moment embrace the faithful impulse?" 
               "I will! I do!" was the firm reply. 
               "Hear me, then," said the stranger: "I am your friend and guide, sent to you by the all-controlling Guardian of your existence. You have now overcome the doubts and the fearful hesitance that keep the human soul in bondage. Now, there is nothing difficult to you. Every effort of your mind will be successful. All toil that other men do know in consequence of lingering doubts and half-way purposes in their pursuits, will to you but be as joyous pastime. You have but to will, and disease abates, foes become friends, distance is annihilated, tears are dried up, old age removes afar off, and every earnest desire or thought of the soul is gratified. Do you seek to lead into the paths of wisdom, holiness, and peace, a thousand youthful minds, and gird on them the armor of a glorious strife with ignorance and sin? This desire, in all its essential features, will be gratified. Indeed, it is foreknown that you will gather around you a noble enthusiastic siastic band of youth, and teach them how to live and die, who will, under your instruction and guidance, go out every where to dress and keep in beauty and fragrance, as the garden of the Lord, the whole land in which you dwell. The very dawn of a new era, namely, the era of CONFIDENCE and VICTORY, has its culmination in you. Child of Destiny, to doubt now were a sin of awful magnitude! Go forth, therefore; begin, struggle, conquer! You have put to flight your only foes-your doubts. Henceforth confidence is the weapon you will employ, and you will beat from your way every thing that may arise to impede you." 
               Here the stranger paused. Quickly a bright and cheerful sunbeam filled the room with its light, and Elbert smiled. Then a dark gloom settled down upon the apartment, a flash of vivid lightning followed it, and then the crashing thunder rolled. The winds and the rains fell, and the earth was desolate and wild on every side as far as the eye could reach. And by and by came forth the RAINBOW in all its glorious colorings, and there was peace. 
               "Behold!" said the stranger, "there is now peace. Such a result will crown your labors. The darkness will be followed by light-the storm and tempest by a sweet, a heavenly calm. You can not, do not longer doubt! You yield your heart and soul to the pure work of goodness, and live henceforth to carry out the infinite and glorious mission of your Creator!" 
                
               Elbert pressed his hand heavily upon his heart, and bowed his very soul before the stranger in the deepest reverence and truthfulness. He uttered no word, and seemed to himself spell-bound and entranced by the presence and words of the being before him. 
               The two sat and gazed long one upon the other. The evening hours went on. Elbert fancied the stranger smiled, and then crimsoned, and then his face grew dark and solemn. Anon there came over it the bland, warm friendliness that had won him. He raised his finger and pointed upward, and his eyes looked upward, and Castlereagh looked upward. Thus gazing, and full of interest, that every moment grew more intense and held him breathless, the stranger meantime seemed to fade away from his sight, his hand relaxed its grasp, the place he occupied was tenantless. Elbert started. A lamp burned clearly on the table, the door of his study was opened, his wife was kneeling at his side and bathing his forehead and temples with camphor. Their common friend and sympathizer, the bereaved and widowed Alice, was rubbing his hands with flannel, the tender-hearted Mina, the servant, was breezing him with the fan, and little Johnnie was wondering on his tiptoes over the back of a chair. 
               "Elbert!" cried Sarah, "Elbert! Elbert! what does distress you? How wildly you have dreamed, and groaned, and mournfully sighed. Here, take and drink this cold water that Mina has just brought you from the well, and it will check this profuse perspiration." 
                
               "Wife! dear, dear Sarah! was it all, and only a dream? Have I seen no one? has no other footstep crossed my threshhold than your own and these?" 
               "None, none! it 's a dream, my Elbert. Come, shake it off, and gaze upon us with your own kind and loving eyes. We can not bear those wild and doubting looks." 
               "Yes, I will. The stranger then is gone. There was no one here. There could have been no one! It was-was it-a dream?" 
               "Truly, only, and but a dream," said Mina. 
               "Has no one come or gone, Mina?" 
               "None, kind sir, but ourselves, believe me." 
               "Thank you, thank you, Mina. What, and Alice, too? Ah! you must have been the stranger." 
               "I have but this moment come here, Castlereagh. You do well to gather up your recollection fully, and consider that you have, as your wife tells me, slept here a disturbed sleep, as she believes, of more than an hour. Oh! you dreamer, will you not have done with dreams, and put on your true manhood, and work?" 
               "I will, I will, Alice, Sarah. Hereafter, I will do that which conscience alone dictates. I will go to work. I will do with my might what my hand findeth to do. I will 'obey the voice divine.' I will toil not merely for myself, but my work shall have conjoined with it a godlike faith. Faith and work shall be my motto. I will no longer dream, and dreaming, dream 
                  
                      
                        A dreamless, soulless dream, 
                        Nor will I longer be 
                        Other than what is seemingly 
                        Well rocked on FAITH, divine and holily. 
                     
                  
                
               Elbert drew proudly up as he spoke, and with a firm tread preceded the party to the rooms below. 
               And the dream was over! 
               No. A few month's intervened, and Castlereagh became a resident of LINDENVALE. The dream went on. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER II. 
               THE REALITY BEGINS-FITZ MAURICE. 
                
                  
                      
                        'Ha, ha, ha!' is the wild boy's cry; 
                        'Ya-ha, ya-ha, ya-ha," the proud eagle's reply; 
                        And the mountain is wild, the cavern forlorn, 
                        That shelters the lad whose locks are unshorn. 
                     
                   
                
               THE daylight of a sweet morning in October came. Lindenvale was sparkling with frosty diamonds in the sun. The breezes from the cold north had hushed away at midnight, and Castlereagh slept a calm, a holy, loving sleep, and Johnnie was beside him resting his nerveless neck on his outstretched arm, and Hobbie lay in his cubbie, the large sweat-drops oozing from under his curling locks. Sarah Matilda had risen with the breaking day, and stolen softly off. Her steps were hastened by the chill of the fair morn, and she flew by a sequestered, winding, and picturesque path, to reach the summit of Bluff Rock, o'er hanging by a thousand feet the sweet village of Lindenvale, e're the sun's rays should pencil it. Climbing from point to point, clinging to the shelving rock where the path was faintly cut, and it had been easy to mistake and fall, penetrating further into the dark shade of the cedars, and anon gaining an open space, from whence she saw the first curling smoke of the dwellings in the valley, she at last reached the headland's summit, and hurried her to the open, storm-beaten brow, where soon she stood a bright figure in the morning's sun, that directly burst up from the eastern horizon. 
               Though enthusiastically fond of the summit, for it revealed a glorious world on either side-a far off, surging, canvas-besprinkled sea-a beauteous city in repose-a quiet hamlet low in the vale-and streamlet, mountain, and forest-and distant church spires of other hamlets here and there-yet seldom had she at so early an hour of the day gone there, and almost never before alone. Never, however, could she have chosen a happier morn, nor could there have been a fitter hour to breathe its pure atmosphere, and to behold all that it was capable of revealing. And she sought to trace with her eye each moving object around her own cottage. She listened to the voices that began to rise up from the awakening town. She traced the movement of Mina around, gathering here and there a dry twig to kindle the morning fire. She gazed for the form of Johnnie, or perchance Hobbie, or the fluttering signal of her husband from the opened casement. She listened for the first notes of the awakening morning-bell in the dome of Castlereagh Institute, and eagerly sought for the first appearance of the merry awakeners, the cheerful, happy lads of the school. But the hour was too early. All slumbered yet, save Mina. Sarah, reclining on the smooth rock, and gazing on the distant landscape, prayed that the world so fair to look on, might be a true and holy Paradise, a fitted temple for the pure worship of God, a cultivated earth for the smiles of heaven. She breathed a sigh over human vanity and sin. She mourned over the recollection that ignorance and depravity, were the great truths, if told, of heathen lands. She considered and rejoiced in the assurance that the Gospel of Jesus is able "through faith" to make men wise unto salvation, and wondered when the sounds thereof might go out into all the earth. These were fitting thoughts for the morning of so bright a day, a place so elevated over the moving tides of human life, so retired and lonely, so near to God. 
               She arose hastily. A stone, loosened from its hold on the brink of the cliff, fell crashing down the dark and dizzy height, and bounding from projecting points, by and by rolled fiercely down the broken, shelving fragments at the foot of the bluff, and awakening startling echoes, bounded once fiercely more, and buried itself forever in the waters of the stream that flowed near the base of the mountain. 
               "Ha! ha! ha!" shouted a young voice in the entangled boughs near her, overhanging the precipice-and an eagle flew screaming away toward heaven. 
               Sarah, for a moment irresolute, was excited by the scene, and directly called out, as she stepped forward, and noticed a slender human figure issuing from his concealment, "What has happened, my lad? Say, did you loosen that rock? Did you frighten the wild eagle?" 
               The boy started at the unexpected sound of a human voice, and the figure of a beautiful woman alone on the mountain at so early an hour of the morning. Then the flush of his cheek fled, and a pale, abashed look seized him, as he recognized in the lady before him, Mrs. Castlereagh. The boy was Fitz Maurice Williams-a wild, rambling lad, of natural genius, but of careless habit, unlike most boys, loving oft to saunter away alone on the crags of the mountain, sometimes building little huts for himself, not unfrequently passing a summer's night in a cave or hut, if perchance he could escape from toil or the watchings of his guardian's cows. Eccentric, wild and roving, he was withal a fair boy, with auburn locks, matted and uncombed, rolling up his ears, shielding his forehead and thickning in his neck, his eyes being keen, but not fierce, indicating kind and genial feelings, but nothing effeminate and weak. His form was slender, approaching even to a delicate and fragile outline; but his step was elastic, and his walk straight, firm, and far-spanning. 
               Mrs. Castlereagh in a moment discovered who the lad was. He had often passed her house. She had frequently observed him sitting on the grass low down by the fence, gazing on the lads at play in the Institute grounds. Not unfrequently he carried in his hand a book, and sometimes she had spoken to him and inquired if he did not love to read, and if he would like to see the picture-books in their library. At this time he held his torn cap in his hand, and stood before her the very picture of an uncultivated son of the wilderness-a boy left to roam. 
               Mrs. Castlereagh called to him to come to her. The boy slowly complied. "How now, my lad, Fitz Maurice-it is you, then! I should suppose no other village boy would be up as early as this, much less on this cliff before sunrise. What brings you here?" 
               "Come last night, ma'am." 
               "You came last night! No, you do not mean to say that you have passed this cold night on the mountain?" 
               "Yes, ma'am." 
               "Wherefore did you this?" 
               "I love to." 
               "But are you not afraid?" 
               "Nothing hurts me." 
               "When the wind blows, and when the thunders roar, and when there are lightning?" 
               "Oh! them I loves-that's half I cums for," cried the boy, with delight. 
               "And the dark?" 
               "The dark is beautiful up here." 
               "And the solitary, lonely hours?" 
               "Ma'am?" 
               "Are you not sometimes afraid of being all alone?" 
                
               "Rather be." 
               "Why so?-don't you love to see the school-boys playing on the green?" 
               "No, not much-because-" 
               "Because-? 
               "They don't think of a poor boy, nor how ignorant he is." 
               "Then you climb up here to get away from such scenes because they distress you. Perhaps you bring a book with you?" 
               "Oh, yes; I have two books now in my rock." 
               "Where is that?" 
               "Oh! it is out yonder." 
               "Won't you tell me about it?" 
               "You don't care for 't." 
               "Yes; I would like to know all about it, and see it." 
               "You'll tell the boys?" 
               "No, if you don't wish me to." 
               "Well, it ain't nothing but a great hanging rock in the woods, resting on the tip-top of the mountain out yonder, split into two or three great pieces, and having a wonderful great cave inside. There I go." 
               "Why! you queer boy-what a place you ramble to. May I go and see it?" 
               "Oh, yes, if you want to." 
               "Is there time, now?" thought Sarah. "Will Elbert rise and miss me, and the breakfast come on ere I can return?" So she eagerly inquired of Fitz Maurice the distance. 
                
               "It's a mighty little ways," said he. 
               "And is there a path to it?" 
               "I know a path to it; but nobody else knows." 
               "If I could go there before my breakfast-bell sounds I would." 
               "We'll run," said the boy. 
               So they started. The boy hurried on, and Sarah, as she best could, followed. Often the boy turned suddenly in his path, and, gliding round a rock or hillock, kept on in a true course toward the huge fragment they were seeking. Presently they encountered a marsh, and the alders, and young cedars, and shruboaks, grew thick and entangled around it. 
               "Here," said the boy, leading his companion close to a large chestnut on the margin of it, near to the abrupt side of a minor hillock; "here is the path-crowd close to the tree, put your foot now on that flat stone just under the bush-spring here to the bank, and cling alone for two or three steps. There, it is all over, now we have good walking." So it proved. Directly they emerged from the low ground, and in a little path winding up to a higher point than and yet reached, soon both stood at the mouth of the cave. Sarah was astonished. It was truly a wild, a wonderful, a magnificent ruin. A huge boulder, resting on the surface, by the elements without or the forces within itself torn asunder, and the different parcels fallen apart, at the base reposed shoulder to shoulder, or stood in crazy independence on their own pedestals. And within there seemed a cave for the wild beasts, a shelter, or it might be a resting-place for the poor exile or fugitive. It was the most singular and wild spot she had ever seen, and her little pale-faced boy of the matted locks called it his "rock-home;" and there he sometimes passed the night, and there he kept "two books." 
               "And now," said she, as she sat down in his cave; "show me your two books." 
               The boy scrambled up the rough sides of the cave, and, reaching as far as his slender arm would go, drew them from behind a projection in the rock-from his bookcase-"Here, ma'am, they are all safe." 
               "Yes, indeed," she answered; "and here we have a book, it is called-why, it is my own Johnnie's Abbot's story!" 
               "Yes, Johnnie lent it to me. I told him I'd keep it good." 
               "So you have; he shall lend you all you want." 
               "May he though-true?" 
               "He may, indeed. You shall have as many books to read as you desire. And here is an Arithmetic!" 
               "Yes, ma'am; that's mine." 
               "What do you with it?" 
               "Oh, study out sums." 
               "What up here?" 
               "Yes, on the rocks." So he pointed here and there to the rough pencilings around them in the cave. Mrs. Castlereagh had never seen the like before. She would not suffer herself to betray all the interest she felt in the strange lad, and the strange scene enacting round her. But she resolved that she would forth-with communicate the whole affair to her husband, and take immediate steps to give the lad the advantages of an education. 
               In the mean time the sun was creeping higher. It was six o'clock and a half-"Hark!" said Fitz Maurice; "there, that's your first bell, and I must hurry away to my cows." The sound of the distant morning bell of the Institute now penetrated the mouth of the cave, and they both hastened to leave. The boy laid his arithmetic on its shelf, but the other book he took away with him. Having conducted Mrs. Castlereagh to a point where all was very familiar to her, he bounded away by one of his own foot-paths, and, in less than ten minutes, as it seemed to her, as she looked from one of her window-openings, on the way down the summit, she saw him springing from rock to rock, in the creek at the base of the mountain, and hurrying over the fields, and up the hill sides, and so on, here and there toward his own home. 
               Hardly had Mrs. Castlereagh reached the last turn of the rude path as it led out from the mountain, than, with a cry of delight, her husband, and Johnnie, and Hobbie started from some bushes and caught her in their arms. Mina had told them where she had rambled, and they had come to seek and surprise her. So she pressed the rosy-cheeked boys to her lips, and was glad to be supported by the arm of her husband; while all chatted and laughed, and so gat them to a fine breakfast that Mina was spreading as they entered their house. 
               Soon the second bell of the Institute sounded, and in came the tutor and the boys, from their rooms, to breakfast and to prayers. And the lady instructress and her young ladies came from their rooms and the parlor. For Castlereagh Institute was already established! 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER III. 
               JOHNNIE AND HOBBIE. 
                
                  
                      
                        Children in their childhood playings, 
                        Awaken in their artles sayings, 
                        Love, and hope, and earnest prayings- 
                        Guides to check from sinful strayings. 
                     
                   
                
               TWO full years had passed since the night of the dream. Nearly one year and a half Castlereagh had been the idolized pastor of Lindenvale. There also, closely adjoining his beautiful parsonage, he had erected a Gothic and picturesque structure for an institution of learning, and furnished it with all necessary and desirable matriel for a school of high order; and, at the present time, it had been four weeks in progress. In one department of the school were lads, in another, girls, and to each was assigned a careful and thorough teacher. Castlereagh daily visited the school, and personally interested himself in every thing that might be conducive to the fulfillment of his great design without undertaking any one burdensome and constant duty there. Yet his slightest wish and work were law. Each room was beautifully modeled for the light and sound; and for the convenience venience of recitations; and to observe all faces; and to pass from one part to another. And in the wings of the building were alcoves for the library, and desks and tables for periodicals and newspapers. And the costly apparatus glittered in its case; and statuettes, heads, charts, and maps, adorned the frescoed walls. The slightest touch of the rich tasseled cord, near the tutor's desk, caused the bell in the tower to give forth its sounds; and the nicely-balanced steel-bar, in a recess, gently struck, gave through the different apartments the richest vibrations to arrest the ear and govern the movements of the school. When Castlereagh entered the front door of the school with a friend, or strangers, he stopped an instant at the threshhold, and, making a slight inclination of the head, the tutor touched with his finger the tremulous bar, and immediately every pupil was on his feet. He touched it again, and quickly each one resumed his place and former position of study. 
               It was Castlereagh's aim not to overburden himself with boarding pupils. Accordingly many applicants were denied. A few young lads and misses were taken under his immediate care in the family, others came to the school as day-scholars, and many of them walked miles, while a goodly number found accommodations in the respectable families of Lindenvale. Still, as far as in his power, he was willing to accommodate the parent who was extremely solicitous of placing a beloved child in his family. 
                
               "Thus I should feel were I sending away one of my own dear lads," thought he. "The care of the child's manners, and the formation of respectful habits, and especially the cultivation of correct intimacies and friendships can not be of less importance than his studies. If they are in the family, then, in one sense, they are always in the school." 
               Castlereagh had spread on the large circular table of his study, a globe and an Atlas. He seemed intently studying the latter, when little Johnnie, then just six years of age, came quietly to his door, and rapped for admission. 
               "Come," said a voice within, and directly Johnnie, with tears on his cheeks, threw himself into his father's arms. 
               "What troubles my boy this day? Why these sobs and tears, my Johnnie?" 
               "Why, father, the boys have got my ball, and won't give it to me, nor give me a knock-and-I-" Johnnie was overcome, and cried. 
               "I presume the boys don't mean to trouble you, my son. They have their recess now for a few minutes, and perhaps have lost their ball. Can not you allow them yours for a little time?" 
               "I wish they'd ask me for it, and not catch it away-that great boy from the shop kicked it right away as I was reaching for it, and then caught it, and knocked it, and would n't let me get hold of it at all." 
               "The boys only want some wild play for a few moments ments, Johnnie. Never mind; I'll see that it comes round to you again. In the mean time let us sit down and study geography a little. I read here in my paper that a vessel touched at Cape Blanco-" 
               "Here, Johnnie, Johnnie!" cried Hobbs bursting rather wildly into the room; "see, here is de ball. Hobbie cotched it up and run, oh! ever so tight, and day could n't get it. Ain't you glad?" 
               "Yes. Thank you, Hobbie; give it to me." 
               "Fadder," said Hobbie, "give me some paper, pen, and ink." 
               "Paper and pencil, Hobbie?" 
               "I want ink." 
               "Yes, but ink is black, and it soils my boy's fingers and clothes. Pencil?" 
               "Please." 
               "Now, Johnnie, while Hobbie scrawls-about this Cape Blanco; I don't see it." 
               "Why, father, there are two or three of them." 
               "Ay!" 
               "Yes; there is one on the Eastern coast, and another on the Western coast of south America." 
               "Ah! well, the one I want is, I think, on the Western. That would place it in what, or near what ocean?" 
               "Oh! of course the Pacific." 
               "True. Now can you point it out to me?" 
               "Guess so. Here! see that! It lies in these large letters." 
                
               "When did you find that, my boy?" 
               "Oh! don't know-some time, s'pose." 
               "Do you study hard, Johnnie?" 
               "No, sir. Study all the evening, sometimes; all the forenoon, sometimes. When I get hold with mother, of geography or music, work away till get through, or the time is gone. Mother and I have gone over the whole Atlas." 
               "Why, Johnnie! and can you remember the places?" 
               "Some I can, some I can't-" 
               "He knows," said Hobbie, "where I lives. Ha, ha, ha!" and Castlereagh laughed heartily with his boys. 
               "And do you know where you live?" said the father. 
               "S'pose so." 
               "Well, tell us?" 
               "Live here! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!" and they all laughed again, and Hobbie went on with his scrawls. 
               "Father," said Johnnie; "Hobbie don't know any thing about geography, and he don't know his letters." 
               "I do know A, and B, and H, and W. See there! I've marked them good." 
               "So you have, Hobbie; quite good. Well, Johnnie, he'll learn some time." 
               "Yes; s'pose so. But there's some larger boys than Hobbie, father, and in the school, who can hardly read!" 
               "Their education has been neglected, my son; and they will, many of them, suffer from it through life." 
                
               "Well, father, I hope you'll try to make them all good boys, not rough fellows, steal my ball, and use bad words." 
               "I hope, my son, they will none of them be wicked and rude. Just come now, Johnnie, let us see where Lieutenant Wilkes sailed. Did you ever trace his course on the maps?" 
               "Oh, yes! I know all about it, and it is very interesting. Mother and I studied it all out one day, and she read me a full account of it in the books, also." 
               "What did he discover, away down in the South Seas?" 
               "Why, father, he discovered the Antarctic coast. There it is." 
               "Yes: I see it. And now, just tell me where Sir John Franklin lost himself down here?" 
               "Down here! Ha, ha! Why Sir John Franklin perished, as it is supposed, searching for a north passage-away up there, father, not down in these latitudes." 
               "That's all right, Johnnie. And where did he sail from?" 
               "Over there, in England." 
               "You were reading, the other day, about Napoleon. Where did he live?" 
               "He lived in France. There's France; and there's Paris, the capital." 
               "And does Hobbie know any thing about these things?" 
                
               "I knows about Napolin Bonepart". 
               "How much do you know, sir?" 
               "I knows he was a great general, and he beat, he did." 
               "Where did you learn that, my bright boy?" 
               "It's all in the Maggazene.
                     Hobbs here, of course, refers to Harper's beautifully illustrated Magazine, and to Abbot's splendid article on Napoleon.
                   I see'd it there, and Johnnie told me; and you can read it for yourself; I'm busy now," and Hobbie continued his scrawls. 
               "Hobbie 'll know something one of these days, Johnnie. As for you, your first letters were learned at the top of newspapers, and on your pewter plate" 
               "So mother says." 
               "And, Johnnie, how does the music flourish? Do you learn any thing?" 
               "Yes, a little. Tell mother I'm going to learn all of Hayden's pieces. I've got over twenty-four pages of the Instruction Book, and play 'Hob Nob,' 'Java March,' and 'Bonaparte Crossing the Rhine.'" 
               Why, Johnnie, you are doing well!" 
               "Think so?" 
               "Very well. Now sit down, and play a little on my melodeon here." 
               "I like the melodeon." 
               "What can you play?" 
               Oh! not much-play 'Corinth,' 'I love to steal awhile away.'" 
                
               "Well, try it. Very good; very good, indeed. Now let us have 'Hebron.'" 
               "No. I can't. Don't play in that key." 
               "What do you like best?" 
               "Can play best in the key of C, and D, and F, and in A minor." 
               "Well, here is a simple piece, and a very great favorite of many." 
               "Don't know it." 
               "What! 'Ortonville?'" 
               "Never played it." 
               "I'll show you. But you know, Johnnie, I play only two parts. I don't yet know how to play the only two parts. I don't yet know how to play the harmony. Perhaps I shall by and by." So Castlereagh played and hummed, and Johnnie looked on and heard. "Now, Johnnie, try it." 
               Johnnie sat down and picked out not after note, and soon produced the whole piece. 
               "Now, father, you shall sit down and try to play the harmony." 
               "I'll try; but you have beaten me, my son. I shan't succeed." 
               The boy looked on and soon begun to be very merry, and directly broke into quite a laugh, when his father declared himself completely unsuccessful in his effort. 
               "Father," said he, "it is the easiest thing in the world." 
               "Johnnie, it may be easy to your little fingers, but it is hard to mine." 
                
               Hobbie now seized his chapeau, as he called it, and rushed out of the room, singing- 
                      
                        "Lay down the shubbel and de hoe, 
                        Take up the fiddel and de bow, 
                        No more hard work for poor uncle Ned, 
                        He's gone where de good niggers go." 
                     
                  
                
               "And so Hobbie is musical too, Johnnie?" said Castlereagh, with a bright smile in the eye of a father proud of his bairns. 
               "Yes, little Hobbie knows pieces, father, I tell you." 
               "And how does he learn them so?" 
               "Oh! mother and all of us sing and play, and he gets hold of them." 
               "Yes, that's the way, I know," said his father. "Now, Johnnie, music is a natural gift, old amateurs and philosophers to the contrary notwithstanding. I am persuaded it is born with some children, and that they can easily cultivate to great perfection the whole science of music, while with astonishing effort only can others acquire a mere rough expression and a very limited knowledge of it. I take the highest pleasure in believing that you and Hobbie have an inborn perception of music, and I hope one of these days you will both of you be able to gratify you parents and all your friends with your development of this most precious boon of heaven." 
               Johnnie seized his ball and cap, and darted away after his brother. 
                
               Castlereagh paced the room. His father's heart was beating proudly over his boys. But his spirit was not at rest when he thought of the rude associations that they might possibly form in the school. He trembled at the suggestion which flitted across his mind, that he could not always know the character of the pupils of his charge, and that seeds of sin and depravity sown in them might spring up a fearful harvest of evil unto others. On his brow a shade of sad thought rested. 
               But Sarah Matilda came and said, "You have had a nice hour, husband, with the boys, and it has been quite a relief to me. I have had a call from our city friends, the Summer's, and they are very anxious that their young niece, Miss Josephine Leland, should take lessons of me in music. What think you, my dear, about it?" 
               Will it be agreeable to you, Matilda? The number of your pupils increases daily, and I fear they may prove too great a tax upon both time and strength" 
               "I should rather like Josephine among my pupils. She is a sweet young lady, and quite a promising musician." 
               "Well, then, I would give her a trial." 
               It was arranged that Josephine should ride out twice a week in the omnibus, and take lessons from eleven to twelve o'clock. She was a delicate, graceful young lady of seventeen, with exhuberant dark tresses, and sparkling black eyes, greatly admired, and justly, for her beauty and lovely character. 
                
               "And now," said Mrs. Castlereagh, "how comes on the dedication-poem, is it?" 
               "Oh, fie, Matilda! A poem for the dedication of the Institute, Hall, and School?" 
               "Well, is it not queer that the workmen should fail to finish the hall in season for the dedication, previous to the opening of the school?" 
               "Yes, odd. But never mind. We have the advantage of a school under a very encouraging beginning, to give us all a little enthusiasm." 
               "No fear the want of that, Elbert, in yourself." 
               "Certainly; I need a little shavings and kindlings to blaze up." 
               "You 'll push your way, husband, if all is dark and all is dame, and my lamp and fire have gone utterly out." 
               "Ho, ho, Sarah! No such thing, now. Why, dear me, child, I have not a quarter part of your energy." 
               "Toot, toot, husband." 
               "Nor a seventeenth of your faith." 
               "Oh, dear me, what a mistaken idea." 
               "Nor a thimbleful of your charity." 
               "Husband, husband, be quiet, and now answer me a plain, practical question, truly. How comes on the Sunday's sermons?" 
               "Dull, dull! I have one that I call new-must preach one old sermon again. Don't look blue, now; it is a good sermon, though old. And I must write out more at length the dedication-poem? for Monday's eve." 
               "Prythee don't kill yourself at the outset, Elbert. Don't, pray don't undertake too much-and yet I must tell you of my morning's early rambles, and what determinations it led me to form." So she told him all the story, as we have written it before. Castlereagh listened to it with the deepest interest, and it was his settled purpose, as they closed their, interview, to obtain the boy Fitz Maurice's release from his present situation, and to receive him permanently into his own family and school. Castlereagh and Sarah Matilda now sat down cosily together, and amused themselves with picturing their future, when retired from busy life, they should dwell in own house. And they passed an hour drawing off plans for their future home, a cottage plan, a square-built house, a sharp roofed dwelling with wings, chimneys with fire-places, etc., etc. Who has not been in his life-time a "castle" builder? 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IV. 
               THE DEDICATION. 
               LINDENVALE was stirred by some new element of life. All was bustle and commotion; eager looks and hasty steps and rapid utterances bore their witness to some unusual excitement in the minds of the citizen villagers. Lindenvale, that reposes in the shade of mountain-bluff and forest, that opens through a long sweet vista on the sea-Lindenvale, with its triple spires, its picturesque dwellings, half hidden in their dark, bowering shade-trees and verdant vines-Linden-vale, with its little waterfalls, chiming sopranos to the out-rattling bassos of heavy machinery in its numerous and scattered factories-was in a tumult of excitement and hurry and cheer. Here were little groups on foot accelerating their walk; ladies springing, with elastic step, along the street, or, peradventure, with nicely-toileted person hurrying along in open carriages. Friend nodded to friend, and every one sought a common point of interest and attraction. The evening air was soft and clear for the season; the white clouds now and then enveloped the round moon and sought her smile; the stars glittered on-those little gold-decorators of the blue sky-and seemed, each one of them, to look down sweetly on the self-same scene, and to be thinking only of the happy souls in Lindenvale. The cheerful, exhilarating sound of the new Castlereagh Institute bell rung out over every roof of the sweet village, summoning the old and the young from their firesides to witness and enjoy the interesting services of the dedication of the Institute and the HALL to the purposes of art and science. 
               And the long, well-lighted hall began to fill-by and by to crowd-at length it became a jam. Choice places near the platform were twice and thrice sought, and disappointed seekers gat them back into the next best places, and wished they had come earlier. Who has not seen this before? But good-nature prevailed; and when a seat broke down, or the press became intolerable, the mass, by one common impulse, swayed a little to the right or left, and relief came-temporary, but allaying fear and quelling murmurs. 
               At the furthest end of the hall there was a decorated platform, with raised seats on each side, for the pupils of the seminary. Over the speakers' table there was an arch of green, tastefully wreathed and interspersed with flowers. On the walls of the room were fastened colored placards, printed in large type, announcing the great objects of a Christian education such as, "THE FEAR OF GOD INCULCATED"-"THE LAWS REVERENCED"-"PATRIOTISM CHERISHED 
                
               Chat game, and buzz began. Young gentlemen chatted with their lady companions, and blessed the mild stars that gave them this opportunity of following up an already-begun acquaintance and friendship. Ladies-some with doffed hats, others slightly vailed, all in nicely-fitted glove and bracelet, and beaming with smiles-attracted the admiring gaze and attention of their friends and customary suitors. A few distinguished gentlemen, trustees, clergymen, friends, or aged ones, the young ushers of the Institute led to the platform. A few seats were reserved yet for expected ones of note or favor, while on either side the raised seats were kept for the members of the school. 
               In the still and retired study, which was a room in the wing of the Parsonage on the second floor, alone bending in prayer, low, humble, grateful, his windows darkened, his doors bolted, was the young pastor of Lindendale, the learned, and earnest, and devoted scholar, the founder of the INSTITUTE. Four weeks had passed since the school was opened, but the dedication, for necessary reasons, has been delayed until now. In the mean time, full seventy pupils, girls and boys, day scholars and boarding pupils, had joined the Institute. 
               Castlereagh felt the importance of the present occasion. He designed, if it were possible, to impress on every mind the great power of educated talent and holy piety. He would that parents and guardians of children especially, might catch something of his own view in respect of parental and home influence on the minds of children in the formation of their characters; and as he sought in prayer the aid of that great Spirit in whose hands, simply as an instrument of good results, he desired to act, the last notes of the tolling bell were sounding. He arose from prayer. A rapping at his door caused him immediately to open it, where he encountered his tutor, Clifford, into whose hands he had placed the immediate oversight and instruction of his pupils. 
               "We begin to wait you, sir," he said. 
               "I am ready, Clifford-say, Cliff, are there seats for all?" 
               "Hardly, sir. Some standing up on the window-frames, and one of our seats has already broken down." 
               "Oh! pitiable circumstance. Let's away-are the pupils arranged, Cliff?" 
               "They await us below." 
               "Well, now, let's go;"-and away they went. 
               The young ushers had, with great difficulty, preserved a narrow pass for the last comers, to the platform. Castlereagh, with a flush of gratified pride on his brow, preceded Sarah along this passway; and as the bell ceased its vibrations, Sarah sat at the piano, and giving the signal march, soon appeared in the hall, led by their accomplished and beautiful teacher, Miss Frances Halloway, a long array of sweet-faced young misses, who filled immediately all the reserved seats on the right of the platform. And as Clifford led in the lads, they proceeded in order and with cheerful smiles, to occupy the seats on the left. The Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling, and the Rev. Mr. Gregorius, were on the platform. Several distinguished gentlemen and highly talented and beautiful ladies were seated near it. Every space was occupied; and the hall, being perfectly lighted, every countenance seemed absolutely shining with delight. As the music of the piano died away, Castlereagh rose and requested the audience, as introductory to the occasion on which they were assembled together, to unite in prayer to Heaven for a blessing. The Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling offered up the petition-an earnest prayer for the blessing of God upon all who were present, and for His smile on the begun enterprise of Christian education of a high character among them. 
               Castlereagh, on the ending of the prayer, arose, with his manuscript in his hand, which he soon laid upon the stand before him, and bowing calmly to his auditory, spoke to them, with hardly once glancing at his papers, in the following words: 
               "WE ARE A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. We have the Bible-have the Church-we have the Sabbath-we have the SCHOOL. We believe in the existence of one God, the Maker of heaven and earth. 
               "Were we this evening, with the pleasant light of the moon around us, to be gathered together as we, in our individualities, are here, in some one of the villages of the eastern clime, along the borders of Japan, of China, of Siam-were we there, native-born and taught, we might wear the same features that we now do, and be of the same physical stature and strength, but how true of us, that in most other respects we should be entirely different from what we now are. We should not only speak a different language, but the language, but the language itself would be to us an insolvable problem. We should be able, probably, to communicate few of its leading principles to the comprehension of a stranger, or to trace it to any reliable source-other, certainly, than to the uncreated BRAHME, whose assistants, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, have filled the earth with knowledge and power. We might talk of education, but it would be a conversation of enigmas and contradictions. 
               "Had we commenced our existence in heathen lands, under the institutions of error and superstition, we had worshiped idols instead of Jehovah, and yoked ourselves to force along, over the prostrate forms of devotees to the senseless imagery of Polytheism, the ensanguined car of moral darkness, which crushes soul as well as body-denying to the one all spiritual freedom, and to the other progressive improvement and happiness. 
               "The great car of the East-of India's intellectual bondage, civil degradation and religious error-though moved on creaking axles by thousands of blind enthusiasts, and though it be the representative of all freedom dom, is infinitely less intelligent, understood and appreciated than the car of the West, drawn by her single Horse of Iron! This thunders forth the progress of man. It answers the desire awakened to get forward. It answers the desire awakened to get forward. It breaks man from his eternal gravitation to the earth, and shoots him off in one of the great centrifugal lines of nature over the horizon. But the other, viz., Juggernaut's car keeps man, soul and body, all the day of life in the self-same place. It compels him to sweat and toil, and then gives him no pay, neither promises him any future amelioration. It awakens no intelligent desires, feeds no curiosity, satisfies no aspiration, but ever stultifies its votaries, and teaches them to degrade themselves to the worship; of a senseless and horrid imagery. This is block worship; or it may take another form, that of nature, and then it is star worship, the worship of the heavenly bodies; or of the rivers, of the trees, beasts, birds, fishes and insects-all of them combined, objects of less importance in the scale of being or creation, that the creature who is taught to worship them. 
               "But, happily, we are here, not there. Let us rejoice. It is well with us. We were cradled on the sea, and have been going up and down in the earth. Motion has been our law. We have found 'land!'-a goodly land. 
               "When India was under the faith of Brahma, and Juggernaut was the personating Deity of creation-some thousands of years ago-this land of ours was an undiscovered waste, the wild man being its tenant. And he had a Deity, but HIS Deity was the Great Spirit-the absolute-the unknown, still, a living Spirit. Yet to the wild man of the woods there was given no mouth of holy prophet, and he, too, worshiped and served he knew not what. He has gone. The red man's footsteps were in the wilderness. 
               "When Columbus hove in sight of this continent, the wild, grim FOREST stood here, and the races of red men were here. But now Columbus has departed; the forest has fallen; the red man, with his war-whoop, his bow and arrow, his scalping-knife, has perished. But there are here a Christian people, and they are strong. 
               "Where NOW is India-she of olden time, Juggernaut's disciple? Is she strong, and wise, and good, and free? She was thought strong in the days of Alexander and Csar, and when Mohammed held Mecca. But she was strong only in a comparative sense, not in true and expansive science, religion, and philosophy. India is now burned over with the gunpowder of Europe. The waters of the Ganges and Cambodia are ruffled by the steamships of her conquerors. 
               "Indeed, indeed, there is something more mighty than elephants or Juggernaut. It is the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE; it is the Christian's steamship and car, the Christian ship, the Christian ax, the Christian temple, the Christian SCHOOL-HOUSE! 
               It is ours to speak of progress. And this we owe to our religious education, using the terms in their widest sense. We educate our sons and daughters according to a Bible standard, taking that for our rule of faith and practice. 
               "We have then much reason to rejoice in the land of our birth, and in the circumstances that now surround us. And as we survey the society in which we live, and note its objects, our attention becomes more and more absorbed in those who are favored with YOUTH, in the very midst of all the privileges that make our land and our institutions. We see them in the enjoyment of schools, and learning the fundamental principles of liberty, religion, and government. We see them gathered to gether in schools, colleges and seminaries, acquiring true knowledge. Our youth are growing up, (or must do so,) an educated class, as well as an industrial one; and we say, the institutions of the land will be committed to the care of wise and good men. 
               "Thus we rejoice. How much there is in this to gladden every true lover of his country-every well-wisher to man! 
               "Our institutions demand intelligence in the people. They were laid deep and firm-in the cement of piety, knowledge, and industry. They require the same sort of care to preserve them that enjoyed in their origin. Hindooism of India, Lamaism of Tartary, Boodism of China, require for their preservation the identical knowledge on which they were originally planned. Give their people truth, light, a true science, a true faith, and they pass immediately into Christianity-they can not longer remain in the darkness of idolatry. In like manner. Christianity and Christian institutions need the aliment of Christian science. Christian ethics alone can do a Christian people service. The philosophy, the science, the laws of heathen nations can do a Christian people no good. To embrace them were the same as to embrace an idol image in the place of the cross-to worship Juggernaut in the place of Jehovah in a Gospel temple. 
               "Here is the difference: Christian institutions are in want only of Christian nourishment, drawn in the first instance from the Gospel, and so continued, expanding and fraternizing with all true science, art, taste, and industry, and the great principles of civil freedom, religious freedom, and toleration. Heathen institutions, as such, want but paganistic, superstitions teachings and privileges. They require no Gospel, no true science, no true science no true freedom, no religious expansion. The art of heathenism is to make abortive every desire of the soul or mind for improvement and liberty. 
               "The school is one of our most important and long-cherished instrumentalities for educating and improving the minds of our children and youth. The school is necessary, because parents are too much occupied to instruct their own children properly, and the children are generally, too thoughtless to devote themselves to a course of study without its regular system of rules and duties. Yet there are found those who have improved their time and the means of self-culture afforded them, out of the school, to an extent that surprises while it also gratifies us." 
               Castlereagh then mentioned the case of a young lad in the place who had borrowed of him, during the summer, more than fifty volumes of books, many of them of a respectable size, and worthy of deep study, all of which he had read as he watched and fed, here and there along the highway, a herd of cows. 
               (The boys and girls clapped their hands, and said it was J-- S--). "Yes," said Castlereagh; "that is the boy. You have all heard." he continued, "of our countryman Elihu Burrit, the learned blacksmith? He is a man of whom the whole nation has, doubtless, heard, and is one of whom the people of America may well be proud. Though untaught in the schools, he has already acquired, at his forge, and by improving morning and evening hours when not required to labor, no fewer than fifty-five spoken and dead languages; and so extensive has his knowledge become of language, that the remark is near to truth which was made of him by Governor Everett, of Massachusetts, 'That he would have been perfectly at home at the Tower of Babel, in the confusion of tongues!' In this respect, certainly, Burrit has attained to the extraordinary eminence of Cardinal Mezzofanti, the great linguist of Europe whom all admit to have been familiar with thirty-two different languages, and by some it has been asserted that he spoke some forty or fifty, and even a much larger number. He died at Rome, March15, 1849, aged seventy-four years.'
                     Electic, April, 1855.
                  
                
               "You have also heard of Zerah Colburn, and of Henry Safford; of the extraordinary genius they manifested, at an early age, for mathematical science; and that in this country and Europe they were regarded with astonishment. Permit me here to call to your notice the attainments in science and philosophy of another individual, of whom, by far the greater part of you, have never heard. I allude to a personal acquaintance and friend, MR. CHARLES C. FROST.
                     Mr. Frost will, I hope, pardon me the liberty, I know forbidden once, I now take with his name. It can not, in the public view, be an unjustifiable freedom; for society at large has claims on him, that his example may inspire her hopes of the young, and lead to efforts, self-sacrificing and generous, in behalf of education that shall open an avenue of progress to the studious, talented, and noble youth of our land, who might otherwise despair of attaining the height of their own ambition, much less to that elevation, conspicuous and honorable, which he has gained by the force of his own exertions.
                     Mr. Frost's father is yet alive, a gentleman of property, at a very advanced age. His mother is also living. They have several children; one married daughter and her husband perished in the burning of the steamboat Erie, on the lake of that name, a few years since. At least one son is a graduate of Dartmouth.
                   At fourteen years of age Mr. Frost left school, and commenced learning the trade of a shoemaker. He worked as an apprentice in his father's shop seven years, when he shortly after became interested in the business of making and vending shoes in a neat and tasteful shoe-store on his own account. He early, evinced a love of mathematical science, and has displayed talents of no ordinary character in its pursuit. He says, in a letter which I have received from him, 'I early imbibed a love of study. I recollect my first acquisitions were in arithmetic, and that the results gave me the highest pleasure. When I excelled other boys in the school, my progress was attributed by them to some peculiar mathematical talent. But it was not so. I boast of no genius. I attribute my success uniformly to more study than others gave their lessons or work, and, perhaps, to a greater love of study.' Mr. frost has found time, not only to become master of all existing forms of algebraic numbers, but is also familiarly and thoroughly acquainted with geometry, trigonometry, and astronomy. He is at home in the Modern Calculus, and in the Principia of Newton, where few of our learned professors venture, or fell at ease. Indeed, in mathematical science he has made so great attainments, that it is doubtful whether there can be found ten mathematicians, in the United States, who are capable, in case of his own embarrassment, of lending him any relief. Remember that we are speaking of a self-taught scholar, and he no genius. Let me tell you how it was done. He says, 'When I went to my trade, at fourteen years, of age, I formed a resolution, which I have kept till now, extraordinary preventives only excepted, that I would faithfully devote one hour each day to study, in some useful branch of knowledge.' Here is the secret of his success. He is now forty-five years of age, and is a married man, the father of three children. Yet this one hour rule accompanies him to this day. 'The first book which fell into my hands,' he says, 'was Hutton's Mathematics, an English work of great celebrity, a complete mathematical course, which I then commenced, viz., at fourteen. I finished it at nineteen, without an instructor. I then took up those studies to which I could apply my knowledge of mathematics, as mechanics and mathematical astronomy. I think I can say that I posses, and have succesfully studied all the most approved English and American works on those subjects.' After this, he commenced natural philosophy and physical astronomy. Then chemistry, geology, and mineralogy, collecting and arranging a cabinet. 'Next, natural history,' he says, 'engaged my attention, which I followed up with close observations, gleaning my information from a great many source; the works that treat of them at large are rare and expensive. But I have a considerable knowledge of geology, ornithology, entomology and conchology.' Not only this; he has added to his stores of knowledge the whole science of botany, one of the most extensive now pursued, and has made himself completely now pursued, and has made himself completely master of it. He has made actual extensive surveys, in his own State, of the trees, shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, lichens, and fungi. Mr. Frost thinks that he may possess the third best collection of ferns in the United States.
                     The reader is commended to an article in "Hovey's Magazine of Horticulture, Botany, etc, etc.," Boston, May, 1852; and also November, 1852, to another article, both from the pen of Professor J. L. Russell, in proof of the reality of these remarks about our friend Mr. Frost. In the one he will read of an excursion taken by the writer, with Mr. Frost, through several sections of Vermont, "to examine the forms of its vegetation, both the larger and the more minute." And he informs you that this gentleman, scholasticus we call him, has studied the name and locality of plants in moments won from his bench to recruit his body and mind. They enjoyed a rich excursion together to the lofty heights of the celebrated Mansfield mountains, picking a great many rare plants, and adding very rich stores to their botanical wealth.
                           See an interesting article in the "Knickerbocker, March, 1855, by Shelton, giving a glowing description of a visit to this same wild and noble summit.
                         In the other, will be found some interesting details of an excursion by Mr. Frost and the Rev. A. H. Clapp, to Willoughby Lake, "in quest of plants, and other objects of interest." Here they discovered some of the rarest plants that are to be found in the United States. The articles in question are exceedingly lively and interesting, although abounding with technicalities, pleasing only to those who can read and understand them.
                   He has also turned his attention to metrology, and devotes much of his time, as do also Olmsted, Maury, Redfield, Smith, Loomis, Mitchell, and many others, to acquire a knowledge of the law of storms and the movements of the erratic and extraordinary bodies in the air and heavens. He has also been driven to the study of Latin, and reads it with great freedom. He has read, and owns most of the gifted poets, and is, to a considerable extent, familiar with history; while his miscellaneous reading has been very extensive. He says of his books "I have a library which I divide into three departments, scientific, religious, literary; composing the standard works published in this country, containing five or six hundred volumes. I have purchased these books, from time to time, with money saved for the purpose by some small self-denials.' 
               "Here, then, we have an account, I assure you it is wholly reliable, of one-plain man of forty-five-who has made the compass, so to speak, of the hill of science; studying his HOUR a day, when the day's labor was done, for more than thirty consecutive years. He began this one hour system when he was fourteen years old. Behold the result. Here is a man with the cares, business, and responsibilities of life on hands, yet a devoted, faithful, successful student. A man who is a profound scholar, and yet a plain-spoken, humble, pious, laboring man, residing still in his native village, far inland; supporting himself by his trade and daily labor, while he is worthy of a position as a teacher in one of the best institutions of learning in the land. Can you imagine the whole benefit that might accrue to a school, of a high order, in any one of our villages or cities if enjoying the direction and instructions of such a man? Of one perfectly familiar with the whole range of science, and so fond of study that no weariness can rob him of his customary HOUR, nor time itself relax his energy or devotion. Who is himself self-taught, and knows the student's trials.
                     We commend this idea to the attention of those communities who may be looking for a teacher of solid learning and character, willing, and able to pay him $1500 or $2000 a year for his services. And Professor Olmsted will accept the hearty thanks of Castlereagh for the offer to himself (when weak in body, and troubled both in mind and estate), of a situation similarly lucrative and desirable.
                  
                
               "Should any of you, my hearers," said Castlereagh, "ever take a journey to the White Mountains of New Hampshire, or to Quebec, by way of the Connecticut Valley Railroad, through the village of Brattleboro', Vermont, of hydropathic notoriety, you will do well to visit the shoe store and shop of my friend of whom I have now spoken-the industrious, careful mechanic-the self-made, and yet almost unequaled mathematician and scholar, this true specimen of a NATIVE AMERICIAN!" (Prolonged cheerings.) "And I Pray the good citizens of Brattleboro' may not tire of the frequent inquiry of stranger-'can you tell me, sir, where I may find the man in spectacles, CHARLES C. FROST?'" 
               Castlereagh then proceeded still further to illustrate and unfold his theme. 
               "Education consists in furnishing the mind with thoughts, and with proper discipline for thought, and in exchanging that which is rough, uncomely, and offensive in manners, for that which is easy, agreeable, and polite. It is the part and the glory of education tion to elevate, ennoble, purify, and strengthen the mind. Other things being equal, the MAN is immeasurably improved by a thorough education. His influence is increased perhaps a thousandfold! Look at him in society: He is at the head of the nation, at the head of the army, navy, the state, the judiciary; he is the leading mind in the Senate, or House of Representatives; he is first at the bar, first in the pulpit, first in medical science and practice, first in the numerous arts; a controlling spirit in manufactures and trades; a tall man among the yeomanry; he is a prince among merchants-a bold and influential navigator. Such men are wanted as engineers on our numerous rail-roads-wanted as surveyors of lands, as printers, as writers, as recorders-wanted in counting-rooms-wanted every where, and in all times. A young man who understands the art of book-keeping, and is also a good penman, commands a salary, sometimes equal to three thousand dollars a year-very often as good as one thousand dollars a year. Look into one of the gorgeous edifices of our cities, or floating steam-vessels and ships on the seas and rivers-see there the skill, taste, and wisdom of the builders. They are ARTIZANS of whom we are proud! Dull-headed, drunken, blundering mechanics can do nothing of this sort. Look into the printing-office! What a world! what an empire of life, and knowledge, and power you care surveying! No driveling sot or fool controls the press; no shiftless, ignorant, lazy, awkward men. No: they who control it are MEN
                     Read the Life of Horace Greeley.
                  -men of power, of thought, of education. The learned professions, and the goodly institutions of any country, are to its honor and glory. They bring out and spur on the human intellect, and cause society to be alive with good, and generous, and active impulses. 
               "We have a country whose immense fields invite you to go forth, young men, with cultivated and Christian character, to engage in the enterprise of business, the cultivation of the social relations, the establishment of a pure Bible faith, or religion, and the security and perpetuity of your unequaled civil freedom." 
               Castlereagh then turned him to the particular theme of the dedication, and reviewing the causes that led to the enterprise of the Institute, dwelling on the future good that might connect with its progress and prolongation, he pronounced the edifice set apart to the great interests of society, to be secured through the instrumentality of education and religion. 
               When he had concluded his long address, the Reverend Mr. Kirk Alling and Reverend Mr. Gregorius made a few most energetic and appropriate remarks, responsive in their sentiment to what had gone before. And then was sung a beautiful hymn by the scholars, prayer was offered, and the great crowd began slowly to dissolve away. And as they defiled down the narrow row stairway, and gained the open porch, the bell in the tower rang over them its happy "adieu! adieu!"-its cheerful "good-night! good-night!" The dedication was over.

               LETTER OF ARTAXERXES SUNDERLAND-LETTER TO ARTAXERXES FROM CASTLEREAGH-TO ALICE FROM THE SAME-GERTRUDE

               WHEN Castlereagh sought his study after the excitement of the dedication was somewhat allayed, he threw himself into his large, easy-chair, and taking his pen, made the following entry in his journal of the day: 
               "Oct.-. I am now thirty years old. Before reaching my age, Alexander had almost conquered the world; Bonaparte had crossed the Alps and subdued Itlay; Mr. Pitt was great in the English Parliament; and Randolph was famed in the American Congress. I have done little either to secure a name to myself or to benefit mankind. Where is the soul that I have ever blessed? Where is the human enterprise that hails me as its great heart and life? Have I, whom the Creator made, lived thirty years, and lived unto myself? Oh! humbling consideration. From this day, I dedicate myself to the world-I will live for its good. I will be a philanthropist; I will strive to pluck from burnings everlasting some immortal souls, and from ignorance bring forth a thousand. The way seems opened. A smiling Providence seems to lead me. I will go forward and complete what has been so auspiciously begun." 
               An unopened letter lay on the table before him. It had arrived with the evening papers. Breaking the seal, he read with difficulty the following words: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "REVUREND MISTER KARSTELRA-

               Castlereagh read the letter, now laughing aloud, now groaning and sighing. At last, crushing the letter in his hand, he cast it on the floor, and ground it under his feet. "The illiterate, purse-proud, and selfish fellow!" exclaimed he. And then he walked his room in his excitement. "Will he keep his son at work on his farm till he is fourteen, till he is old enough for college, and old enough to know everything he need know for the common affairs of life, and then send him in his ignorance and mortification to me to teach him A, B, C, and perhaps remove him at the close of this very first term? No, no. Let him be sent to the District School. I don't want him, ignoramus, big booby of a fellow." Accordingly he took his pen to write a refusal. Presently it occurred to him that the boy might be brighter than the father, knowing more of books than was represented, and one, who though ignorant, might, by long and faithful application and exertion, become a useful and intelligent scholar and citizen. Aware that the labor must be great at best, that should reclaim from gross ignorance a lad of his years and habits, he shrunk from the effort and responsibility, but at length determined that he would make the effort, and wrote Sunderland Artaxerxes, as follows: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "MY DEAR SIR-
                            
                           "Your letter that now lies before me, gives me no very flattering description of your son Amos. I think it a very great misfortune that you should have kept him so long time at work, when he ought to have been in school. He will, in all probability, be a sufferer through life in consequence of your neglect of his education cation. However, I am disposed to give him a trial. If you will place him entirely under my care for three years, I will, if he be possessed of at least common talents, then send him back to you a different boy in many respects from what your letter represents him at present. I can not take him for one term, nor even for one year. 
                           
                              "Respectfully yours,

               Folding the letter, and casting it aside, he then sat down to fulfill a promise to Alice. It was nearly eleven when he commenced, and writing as rapidly as circumstances would permit, the clock struck twelve, and hurried nearly another half-hour away e'er the work was done, and Castlereagh had sought his pillow. 
                
                  CASTLEREAGH TO ALICE. 
                  
                     "DEAR MADAM-
                   
                  "It was not duplicity that controlled me in breaking up my residence in Richmond. No, believe, me, it was a far different sentiment, and an object as high and pure as that is contemptible and ignoble. I could have died there in the performance of duty. But I sought something more than mere life in my removal. It was an extended field of usefulness. I decline to say anything further, less to you, might savor of that which I now ignore. 'Ungrateful?' Flatly, I am not. Ingratitude forms no part of my being. I do not recollect a friend to whom I have ever turned the cold look, or cherished for him other than the sincerest regard. Men may construe actions as they will, but my motives will bear inspection in the highest courts of wisdom and truth, whence some men may be driven in shame. It is my great aim to do good, to educate and influence, and bless the rude and ignorant as well as the more refined of mankind. I wish to begin this course with the young, and with my own children, who will soon require a great deal of attention. I have also the care of Gertrude's education, who is my half-sister, and to whom I am bound by duty and affection to provide the best facilities of instruction in my power. My own mother, holy, beloved, amiable, affectionate, I saw laid down in her grave. Over that grave we shed tears of early sorrow, and brothers and sisters, entwined in a common embrace, lifted up their prayers to heaven for support. They planted the sweet-scented blush rose at her grave, and the myrtle leaves are still green over her ashes. 
                  "In three years our revered and kind father gave us a new mother-sister Gertrude's mother. We loved her and she idolized us. She became the mother of four children-two were sisters, two brothers. The younger brother soon died. Consumption had well-nigh carried to her grave their mother, and we were daily expecting the black-sealed envelop, when, at midnight, as Sarah Matilda and myself were sleeping in our warmest room for dread of the cold December night, a horsemen galloped to our door, and with a loud voice awoke us. On my throwing up the window, he informed us that he had been sent to forward heavy tidings; the letter which he bore would give the particulars; but the import was briefly the sudden and alarming sickness of my father! Can I describe to you the overwhelming nature of this shock! Never was there a kinder heart than his. How dearly beloved was he! How he sate up until midnight in the chilly night of a late day in October, to keep burning the fires that should impart their cheer to myself and Sarah, when on our bridal-tour we were drawn lazily over the mountains, and first, together, visited his distant home. How cheerfully, happily, he bade us welcome! Ever was it thus. And now, alas! wounded? Yes; a small bruise neglected, had inflamed horribly! He lay nearer death's door than the feeble sufferer, his wife. Carried swiftly onward the next day and night, the frost biting us sorely, Sarah Matilda and myself reached the family mansion. Alas! too late. The beloved father, whose farewell blessing we sought, lay in his last repose. We followed him to his grave. Sixteen days after and the wife and mother slept also the same slumber, and was buried beside him-and home was spoiled. The little ones were given to the married brothers and sisters. I was appointed guardian to Gertrude, and early in the following spring, I bore her in my arms, in the evening, as she slept from fatigue, from the steamboat landing to our own home. She was in her ninth year-an affectionate child and sister. 
                  "Six years have nearly expired since that evening. It has been the effort of our life to instruct her, and develop those principles and powers of mind which ever may reasonably be expected to appear in answer to continued and faithful instruction. 
                  "It were worth a life's exertion to accomplish this for one human being, not only for one so nearly related and dear to us, but even to one related only by the common links of our humanity. A life! Yes, all of life, to train one thus to know more of the great powers of the human soul-to know more of nature-to know more of God, of Christ, of salvation, of eternal things. And if so greatly valuable this labor in the case of one immortal mind-of one of human blood and kind, consider the immense importance of that service when it results in turning MANY precious ones into paths of light and salvation they had otherwise never seen or trodden! Oh! what can equal the value of labors thus performed. The worldly, selfish, busy sons of time think not of these ennobling and benevolent exertions but with sighs, and shrugs, and cold, repellent hearts. Yet the LABORER is worthy of his hire; and as God is the Judge, who doeth all things well, the LABORER shall not finally go unrewarded-the object of strong condolence and meaningless commiseration. He shall stand BEFORE kings. 
                  "Pray excuse me if I have, at this late hour, failed to make my ideas intelligible, or have omitted some points material to the interest of the subject. I am filled with the purpose of doing all in my power to aid the young in securing to themselves the best education possible. To this I lend my principal exertions. The young men of our country are remarkable for their energy, devotedness to an idea, whole-heartedness in what they engage, perseverance in pursuit-and they show all these traits of character in applying time, talents, fortune, labor-years of labor, to gain artistic knowledge and skill, the rules of trade, the power of letters, and professional science. They are a busy, noble republic of youths. The whole frame of society supports itself in them. I am engaged in a goodly work to help to educate them; and come what may, let me not forget that it is for God and my country that I labor. I rejoice every day in the society of your children. Hayden's peculiarities, and Stella's frankness give me an agreeable study. My duties are arduous, though pleasing. May but my strength last a few years, I will do a good work here. For this I pray. 
                  
                     Yours, etc.,

               CHAPTER VI. 
               HERE ARISES THE STORY OF CLIFFORD AND OLIVIA 
               CASTLEREAGH had at length broken away from his former parish and labors, and had now become the resident pastor of the interesting parish of LINDENVALE. 
               It was stipulated at the time of his settlement, that he should have the liberty to establish, and have the care of a school for the intellectual and more improvement of the young learners of the village, and of such as might resort to him from abroad. 
               With funds procured him by his friends-friends, true, unflinching and generous to the last-the Seminary buildings were erected, and made a goodly appearance. The Institution was situated on one of the main streets of the village, a little in the back-ground of the lot, and on a rising hillock covered with oaks and walnuts and chestnuts. Into the midst of these the edifice was let down (i. e., built up), and there, in one of the sweetest shades-in one of the most retired and winning groves in all the valley of Lindendale, the young minds of the Institute were forming for the busy work and play-ground of life.
                     Rather as a desired locality and model.
                  
                
                
               We will introduce the school family to you. 
               There are two departments to the school; one is for the young gentlemen and lads, the other for young ladies and misses. Clifford presides over the former, and Miss Frances Halloway over the latter. Castlereagh has a position as instructor in the higher mental and moral sciences, having deemed it best for the Institute to hold some positive relation to it of this sort. 
               He has on him, also, all the general management of the school and family, outwardly superintending and financiering. He plays the part of diplomatic minister, and seals and breaks the foreign correspondence. He prepares the public expresses and bulletins, and knows where the different wires are sprung that announce opinions. He has in charge the commissary department, with its ever-recurring relation to steaks, roasts, fries and bakes. In the government, he can not otherwise hold an umpirage. 
               Clifford Hayward, having completed his University studies, was now spending the last half-year of his professional course with Castlereagh, the husband of his sister, Sarah Matilda. A long, severe course of study had impaired his health, and Castlereagh induced him to take the position of principal teacher in his school for two years. With his assistance, the Institute was opened very much to every body's satisfaction, especially that of Castlereagh. Clifford added to good sense, wit, conversational power, poetry, music, sentiment while sympathy was not a redundant item of himself, but an affluent aggregate of his nature. He could weep-but only when the lachrymal tide was forgotten, and his soul was broken. He could suffer (as Castlereagh had seen him) the highest degrees of personal anguish, prostrated on his couch, pale, convulsed, and near dying, without a tear. But when the sweet, curly-haired, amiable and precocious sister, LOUISA, died, and there was no more life in her, he cast himself with such a bitter groan on the bed, and wept with such convulsive paroxysms, that others wept for him, and forgot the dead! His was a strong sympathy, but not a controlling point in his character. It was rather his nature's antidote, useful, extraordinary, but never as a commodity. 
               The School-boys loved him. And he had his favorties, who could always win him any where, and lead him from his musings. On the play-ground they ran to meet him, and chose him on this or that side of the game, to give a rival party what they called a Waterloo defeat! Alas! poor NAPOLEON, that every great discomfiture, signal and manifest, should take its nomenclature from thine! But the passionate sympathy of a world pours out its oblation over thy misfortune in the name of Waterloo. The glory of the conqueror is forgotten in sorrow for the conquered. The human mind seems unable to prevent this; for to say that one was the greater general than the other on that fated field, is but to accummulate fresh emotions of sympathy for him whose sword that day was sent home to its scabbard bloodless; who "slept his last sleep on a lone isle of the ocean." 
               At Richmond, Clifford formed the acquaintance of a beautiful young friend, who was a few weeks a visitor at his sister's. She resided in one of the Northern cities, and was passionately fond of Nature as developed in the rural villages of New England. She was fond of botanizing, and would ramble over the most distant hills for a rare plant, or venture into the dark ravines in quest of any thing that would enrich her herbarium, even a simple fern itself. She was but seventeen years of age, yet her form was fully developed and graceful. Her dark ringlets hung in great clusters down her neck and arms. Her conversation was lively, enthusiastic, intelligent. Her manners highly cultivated, and her heart pure and trustful. 
               Clifford often accompanied her abroad, and seemed never happier than when he could be her escort in her rambles, or regale her with his music. Their acquaintance seemed fast ripening into a personal regard, when Olivia received a sudden summons to return home, and accompany an invalid sister to the South. Clifford was quite unreconciled to so distant and uncertain a parting; but disdaining to complain aloud, he merely became less sociable and apparently indifferent! Olivia, busying herself over her preparations for leaving, concealed in the main the true feelings that may have fluttered in her heart, and it was beyond the eyes of Castlereagh, probably of Clifford, to discover any sorrow in her separation that did not connect with her suffering sister. Clifford was a little piqued at this, thinking it strange that so agreeable an acquaintance could be terminated, perhaps forever, with so little apparent regret! He thought of a great many ways of telling her so before she left. But no opportunity seemed to occur favorable to it, even though they took their walk together as usual on her last day at Richmond, and were a whole hour together humming music in the evening. Only this was said between them, "When you reach Alabama," said Clifford, "perhaps some time or other you may receive a letter from me." 
               "That," said she, "is hardly supposable." 
               "Why?" 
               "Because the mails seldom reach the back-hill settlements!" 
               Clifford was about thinking of some proper answer to this, when company appeared, and their tte--tte was broken. 
               The next day Olivia's place was vacant, and she soon after accompanied her sister and friends on their Southern tour. 
               When the school is over for the day, Clifford frequently wanders away into the forest alone. His hands are thrust deep into his coat-pockets. He, apparently, cares but little where he goes, or how long time he may be absent. Castlereagh often thinks, at such times, that Olivia may be in his mind, her image painted on his heart, wandering with him in the groves. 
               But let us go on with our introduction to the school under Clifford's care; there are about forty lads, some of them looking exceedingly bright. They are from the village, many of them-a part from neighboring towns and from distant cities. Some of them are boarding-pupils, others are day-scholars. They are learners all the way from Webster's Spelling Book and Mental Exercises in Arithmetic, to Euclid, and Virgil, and Homer. Good, bright, keen, hard, wide-awake boys. They will learn good and evil fast. Look out for them, Clifford-Castlereagh, pray for them!- 
               Here is one of them. He sits cross-limbed and diagonally on his seat. His left hand rests heavily on his opened Algebra. His right plays with his penknife. His hair is thrown into wild grass-clusters and entangled nets. His collar is off, and his neck-tie loose and open. A fixed, and yet easy. though unreadable expression sits on his whole phiz. He is not at work, nor is he at play. Speak to him, and he hears you; leave him, and he is never alone; molest him and he will give you a blow or a keen reproof; crowd him, and he will close his book; give him a gentle smile, and he will re-open it. This is Hayden, careless, easy, fixed, peculiar. 
               And there, leaning back in his seat, in fat, fair, and easy independence, is Horace. His dark hair curls around his ears, and rolls around his brow, and hangs gracefully here and there, never looking combed, and seldom uncombed; and his eyes sparkle under his shady lashes, black-and yet smiling, laughing eyes, small twinklers in banks of fat, and dimpled cheeks, and bewitching smiles. But Horace is too fat and easy for a scholar. He is tired; look, he nods in his seat. "Horace!" 
               "Sir!" cries the waking youth. 
               'Don't go to sleep!" 
               "No! sir!" 
               And here is a surly-looking, uncultivated fellow, a great green boy from a distant town. Look out for him boys. He carries anger in his eyes. He is yelept Hyder Ali, and will make, by and by, a soldier in the Turk's grand army. 
               In the corner of the room, close by the window, in a cosy, well-to-do sort of a seat, with his books all well-packed and arranged; his person well-attired; his bright countenance showing a boy of uncommon native energy and enthusiasm; his eye bent on his book, and careless of the hum of the school-room is the lad we have already heard somewhat of. It is Amos, the son of illiterate Artaxerxes. The boy reads slowly, but correctly. He lays a good foundation for every one of his studies. Castlereagh sits beside him a few moments. 
               "Amos!" 
               "Sir?" 
               "Getting on?" 
                
               "I hope so, a little." 
               "Love the book?" 
               "Somewhat, sir!" 
               "You read and write?" 
               "Beginning-rather back of the fellows." 
               "You will overtake them, if industrious." 
               "Yes, sir, some of them." 
               "What is your highest motive for studying, Amos?" 
               "Motive? To please my father." 
               "You love your father, do you?" 
               "Love him! Indeed, sir, I love nobody else as well." 
               "He is then, I presume, a kind and a good father?" 
               "Did you, sir, ever know one who was not?" 
               "Most men are kind to their children." 
               "My father, sir, never bade me do what is improper. He wishes me to study and make myself an intelligent man. I study to please him." 
               "Amos, go on as you have begun. Your father will reward you with his continued love, and your heavenly Father will bless you, if you also do all things to his glory. He has said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother.' Good-by." 
               There is a lad that has his desk near the teacher's platform, and he too is a bright, thin, pale-faced, and flaxen-haired boy. His eye can flash, his white cheek redden. His features, when composed, indicate no very decisive strength of character. He is mild in appearance; but all his actions show him attentive to what is passing. His movements are quick, his lessons are perfect, his behavior sober, his intercourse with others kind, and respectfully retiring. He never quarrels, but is not tame, nor is he a coward. He pursues the even tenor of his way, and is acknowledged a fine scholar, and a fine companionable fellow by all. It is Fitz Maurice Williams. 
               There is a row of boys, good, bad, indifferent, occupying the central desks. They whisper by stealth, they study under law, they are the rough unhewn oak and the unchiseled marble. They will hardly bear smoothing, but may become substantial pillars and blocks in the edifice of mind. Hark! and you will hear now and then from one of them a heavy breathing, a lifting of the chest, as though the task were infinitely impossible. Look! and you will observe one gazing off on the green fields, intently watching the flying of the birds and the frolic of the lambs. Withdraw a moment, and lo! the pack all yawn, or smile, or gesticulate in mirth or anger, and appear a disordered band, ready for a rush, a mlee. Appear again, and behold! quiet reigns, order is resumed, every seat is filled, every eye is bent on the page; industrious! earnest! faithful boys. Some of you will come within an inch of States Prison by and by. In many a rumpus you will bear your part. Look out for the police staff when after swindlers, and remember to vote strong against capital punishment. There are large boys, there are small boys, there are bold and shy, truthful and false; there are favorites and friendless less; there are quarrelsome and pacific; there are strong and weak; there are hectors and sufferers; there are revengeful and forgiving. 
               "What is the matter, Peter?" 
               "Roswell Childs struck me." 
               "I did not strike him-he kicked me." 
               "I did not kick him, sir." 
               "He did." 
               "Come here, Roswell and Peter-what is the matter, and what is truth in all this?" 
               "The truth is, sir, that Peter Hills is always kicking, and careless whether he hits me or the desk." 
               "Does he kick out of a sort of spite, or when he is absorbed in his studies without thought?" 
               "Whichever way, he sometimes hurts a fellow, that's certain." 
               "Well, do you seriously think, Roswell, that Peter intentionally gave you a kick?" 
               "How could it be otherwise, sir, when there is room enough for him on his own side?" 
               "Well, have you had any quarrel together lately?" 
               "Yes, sir, he quarreled with me to-day." 
               "What did he do to you, sir?" 
               "He-he-stole my knife." 
               "And you?" 
               "I caught him and-and-got it back, sir: that's all." 
               "Well, Peter, how is it? Do you try to kick Roswell?" 
                
               "I do not. I am not aware that I ever kicked him." 
               "You l-," Roswell was just uttering, when Clifford stopped him. 
               "You did not intend to kick him?" 
               "I had no occasion to, sir." 
               "Have you not quarreled with him?" 
               "He has been angry at me, sir, because I forgot last night at the close of school to return his knife, which he had lent me." 
               "Then he lent you his knife?" 
               "He did." 
               "He begged it," says Roswell. 
               "It is true, I asked him for it." 
               "Then you have not kicked him purposely; you have not quarreled with him; you have not stolen his knife. What did he strike you for?" 
               "I do not know, sir." 
               "Why did you strike him, Roswell?" 
               "For kicking me." 
               "Henderson! Did you see this matter?" 
               "No, sir." 
               "Did you, Hogarth?" 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "Did Peter kick Roswell?" 
               "Don't know, sir." 
               "What do you know about it?" 
               "I saw Peter curl and cry." 
               "What made him curl and cry?" 
               "I could n't say, sir." 
                
               "Well, your testimony is not worth much." 
               "Jones! Did Roswell strike Peter?" 
               "Yes, sir, he did." 
               "What for?" 
               "For stealing his knife. I believe." 
               "When did he strike him?" 
               "This morning, sir." 
               "Oh! ho! We don't progress at all with such testimony-all off the track, Jones. Did you see him him NOW?" 
               "Now? No, sir, I didn't." 
               "I come back, then, to you, Roswell. You allow you did strike him. Give me your hand. Once! twice! three times! Will you strike him again? Speak! Tell me if you are going to maim a little fellow like Peter Hills, when he is quietly pursuing his studies?" As the dark eye of Clifford searched the boy's conscience, his brute will gave way, and with a downcast face, and eyes swimming with tears, he faltered, "No, Sir, I will not." 
               "Then, with this, I forgive you. Redeem yourself in my opinion quickly, or you must forfeit my respect and your privileges in this school." 
               Castlereagh heard of this, and sighed over it, lamenting the development of such evil in the character of any of his pupils. He drew Roswell and Peter into his study, and made them sensible of the importance of kindness one toward another, and succeeded in softening to a considerable extent the rough character of the elder boy. Already he discovered that he had undertaken a great work, to educate the mind, and to regulate the hearts of his pupils, securing correct and kindly habits in their familiar intercourse with one another. But the school progressed. It was popular. Every body praised it. Every body sent pupils. The newspapers praised it. "We know not a more agreeable and fascinating teacher of youth than the Rev. Elbert Castlereagh, nor an institution for the development of mind and character is early life equal to the recently established Lindenvale Institute." Every day or two came letters or inquiry or personal applications. Mr. Castlereagh would set himself in his study to sermonize early in the day. Directly he is called down. Mr. A. is in the parlor with his son, whom he wishes to place in the school. Mr. B. calls directly after to inquire the price of tuition Colonel C. D. calls in fifteen minutes to introduce his friend Mr. E. from the West Indies, who has a son he desires taken into the family to board. The morning wears away, the sermon drags. It is noon. Dinner is announced, and after it, engagements abroad prevent any sermonizing. See the pastor. He is by the sick bed. He is at the mournful funeral. He is passing hours in a distant District School as an examiner of its condition. He is at tea three miles from home. He is anon at home, and all the family cluster round him. He must make one in the little gathering of the evening home circle. The programme represents "magic music," "tableaux," "story-telling," "quadrilles by amateurs," and "a grand chorus of sacred music to close." And the sermons drag. At ten, when the family circle breaks up, he is weary, and by eleven sleeps." 
               But there is another department of the school. Cast back these folding-doors and you step directly into it. Here are thirty or forty young ladies and misses, presided over by Miss Halloway. They have each a separate desk, and occupy a large and singularly neat and tasteful room. The young ladies smile on Castlereagh as he passes them. They form a most delightful group. Is there a more interesting sight than a roomful of happy-faced, intelligent, earnest, studious young ladies, who are all devotedly attending to those studies and acquisitions which will elevate the character and embellish life with every attractive grace? Castlereagh was always charmed with the sight, and took the deepest interest in the improvement of each one of his fair young pupils. He found especial pleasure, also, in introducing visitors to this department of his school. Rarely did one visit it without partaking of his enthusiasm. 
               "Stay! Mr. and Mrs. Kirk Alling, a few moments, and we shall close the school with singing." 
               They expressed a pleasure to wait. 
               "In the mean time," said Mrs. Kirk Alling, in a low tone, "pray tell me who that tall, dark-haired girl in the corner may be?" 
               "Oh! that staid, sober-looking miss, poring over her French book? It is Miss Melinda Hillhouse, a distant relative, as I suppose, of the celebrated James Hillhouse, of a neighboring city. She is our poetess." 
               "Indeed! I fancy there is something refined and elevated about her. She has an intellectual face, a fine forehead, a commanding, though a rather set expression." 
               "A noble girl, madam; just seventeen, and without a passion equal to her love of the muses." 
               "What has she done with her pen?" 
               "Oh! we shall see-we shall see. She is a mere girl yet. Let her alone for awhile-we shall see." 
               "Here, on the left, are two bright-looking girls, sir. I think they are exquisites in their way." 
               "Ha, ha! Yes. They fancy life a great affair to them. They are fond of their showy dresses and top-knots; and, strange as it may seem to you, one of them is our best mathematician." 
               "Indeed! I must know her name." 
               "Grace Percival." 
               "Not the daughter of the plain Mr. Percival, in the North Section?" 
               "The same. Her parents are plain, unobtrusive people, but they have remarkable character. Mr. Percival is himself fond of mathematics, and every evening studies with his children. He is a very fine surveyor, and a citizen highly respected. Mrs. Percival, when a girl, it is said, was fond of gay things, and so it comes natural to the daughter. By and by you will see a strong notable character there." 
                
               "And the other?" 
               "Oh! I don't know as much about her. She is a great reader, and can sing most sweetly." 
               Mr. Kirk Alling admired the pencil-sketchings of two young misses near him, and in commending their work, inquired their names of Castlereagh. 
               "Isabel and Stella: they are both inmates of my family; and so is Miss Hillhouse; and there are some three or four besides them." 
               The bell in the cupola was struck a few times, the absentees came hurrying in from their private studying-rooms, books were all laid aside, the folding-doors were opened, and the two departments appeared, arranged, each in its proper order, and all the bright faces turned toward the central platform, where were the teachers and visitors. 
               Clifford took his seat at the piano. 
               "My scholars," said Castlereagh, "the duties of the school-room are now, for another day of life, ended. I hope that you have all so passed this day, that you can part in peace and love, and can now unite heartily in singing the beautiful hymn- 
                      
                        "'The Prince of Salvation in triumph is riding, 
                        And glory attends him along His bright way; 
                        The news of his grace o'er the breezes are gliding, 
                        And nations are owning His sway. 
                     
                      
                        "'Ride on in Thy greatness, thou conquering Saviour; 
                        Let thousands of thousands submit to Thy reign, 
                        Acknowledge Thy goodness, entreat for Thy favor, 
                        And follow Thy glorious train. 
                         
                     
                      
                        "'Then loud shall ascend, from each sanctified nation, 
                        The voice of thanksgiving-the chorus of praise; 
                        And heaven shall re-echo the song of salvation 
                        In rich and melodious lays.'" 
                     
                  
                
               The hymn was sung with much enthusiasm by the school, Sarah Matilda gliding in just in season to lead off the air. The school was then closed; and, after the usual running here and there to find a lost glove, shawl, bonnet, cap, or book, the boys hurried away; and presently, with all heartiness in many an embrace, and love in many an upturned lip and cheek, the young misses, one after another, and anon in little jaunting and shouting clans, went their several ways, homeward. 
               "My! what an interesting life you are leading here, Brother Castlereagh!" said his reverence, Kirk Alling. "It is wonderfully so. How full of promise to you, and to them, and to the world-why, I should like this myself!" 
               "Well, my dear Brother Kirk, when I make change, I should like it that you were my successor. It is in truth a great, a thrilling, an immeasurably interesting position. Here are eighty young minds forming for influence in the world. Their position will affect thousands-I may safely say millions. You may consider a school of this sort, the begun center of a circle of influences of mind on mind, its larger circumference reaching into the very heavens." 
               "I see it-I see it, sir. Here are your ministers preaching to hundreds and thousands of souls, some of them, in their turn, preaching to others. Here are your lawyers and statesmen. Here are your gifted artisans, merchants, and professional men of all sorts. Here your authors and fair ripe scholars, male and female-fathers and mothers, whose cultivated minds and hearts shall make a gladsome home for their children, and so go far to sustain every good and religious institution." 
               "You have it, brother. That's the view. It's a world-wide one; and as generous as it is large." 
               "And is not the care, the anxiety excessive?" 
               "Oh!-why-for that matter, one must expect something of the kind. Yes, I have much to do. There are some difficulties to overcome-some anxious hours to get through. But with nerve, dear sir, nerve all up, and the work promising so well, I hope to get on." 
               Clifford sat drumming at the piano; now a light melody then a low broken succession of chords-anon flourishing through some wild air of Mozart. 
               "What call you that, Mr. Hayward?" inquired Miss Holloway, approaching him, and languidly leaning on the instrument. Clifford said nothing; but as he rollicked away over the music, slowly moved his face toward her, with one of his penetrating glances, from which, almost starting, she exclaimed: "Now, fie, Mr. Hayward; your moderato quasi andantino, your allegro vivo energico are thrown away on the company. See! There are the two married ladies sauntering off by themselves. And do hear their good, venerable reverences' praise up school-keeping! Oh! it is delicious! Hear them. They think there is nothing so 'thrilling,' so 'compensatory,' so 'full of promise,' so 'happy' on earth. Oh, dear me!-Well, is it not rich and curious though?" 
               "Very," said he, in reply; and shutting up the piano; continued, "and now for a ramble, eh?" 
               "If you please, sir;" and away they hastened for a long, delightful range of the groves and mountains. 
               Castlereagh soon after sat down in his study to write sermons. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
               THE CHURCH, THE PEOPLE, THE PRAYER, THE SERMON, THE HOUR. 
               As Castlereagh entered the aisle of his church on the Sabbath day, the sexton ceased to toll the bell, and the organist began to fill the house with the rich tones of the instrument under his care; other sounds were hushed, the leaves of books were unturned, slipdoors opened and closed with care; forms of persons in the dark aisles silently as shadows passed from one point to another, and sank to their seats. Few came with bold, up-staring-gazing features to see and be seen. The appearance of the Lindenvale church was that of a calm, pious assemblage, who came together to worship the Lord of Hosts, to pray fervently to Him, in all sincerity confessing their sins. They came to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ from one of his humble and earnest embassadors. They expected if he spoke to them of sin, they should be made to see its execrable nature, and the impossibility of human escape and relief. If, of the law, they should tremble under its eternal purity and sanctions; if, of the atonement, that the whole plan of redemption would be sketched before them; if, of the practical duties of life, that these would be arranged in no imaginary form high out of sight; but in the discernible verities of our sin-stricken earth and suffering society-world, as it is. Woe to him, who, with a tender conscience, has neither said his prayers, nor read his Bible on that day. The preacher would soon find him out, and send an arrow of conviction to his heart. He would pray for blessings on all those who, on that day, had sought first the forgiveness of their sins, and a due preparation for the sanctuary, by fervent supplication before God, in the retirement of the closet! Ah! here were some cut off. He would pray for light and for enjoyment among all those who had made the Word of God their morning study. And here again, some who had slumbered late, and some who had toileted late, had little sense of personal advantage. And when he prayed for poor, unworthy sinners; here again, some were found to whom the prayer conveyed but little heart-felt enjoyment, because of pride. And when he prayed that heavy chastisements and harassing affictions, and poverty, and all suffering, might not delude men, as, though these were an atonement for their sins, and a ground of their pardon-alas! some had not a deepness of theology, nor a reading of Scripture adequate to go along with him. And so, when he prayed that God would glorify Himself in all things, whether by the sinner's salvation or condemnation, mihi miserabile! can he mean to pray thus? 
                
               Castlereagh's prayers were short. He frequently seemed not to know whether they were short or extended. They were usually the former, and ended abruptly-impressively. But they were meant to be prayers-prayers for dead sinners-but living men, for whom Christ died. Prayer must be humble, devout, unto God; a thanksgiving, a confession of sins, supplicatory, submissive. It must be kind toward men, and self-abasing before God. 
               Castlereagh read the Word of God, with an eye fixed down upon its pages, as studying into, and understanding, and enjoying its transparent sentences. It seemed as though he heard rolling through it, the River of the Fountain of Life. As he gazed on it, deeper floods of the Light of the World waved before him, and dispelled his darkness. As his soul became an hungered, over it the Bread of Life was conveyed to him and he was strengthened. His earnest readings led many of his congregation to open their Bibles and follow him closely, striving themselves to be near the great sources. And he sought to keep them with him, ever as it were, waving the upward hand, a signal of the track over which he was led, and an invitation and entreaty to them to go with, or to follow after him. He felt the richnes of the simple Bible-words, and himself was able to work out many a full, soul-satisfying commentary on them. Impressive reading of the sacred Scriptures, hath in it much to awaken and instruct. Castlereagh's Scripture-readings and brief comments were thought among his best things on the Sabbath. Thus was the BIBLE honored through him. 
               He took for himself and for others a deep interest in the praises of the sanctuary; and his soul seemed often in transports of rapture, just on the high wings of an angel homeward-bound, as he listened to the songs of redemption poured forth from the voices of redeemed sinners around him. Blessed employment of the gifted muse, to cast the sacred text into lyric verse, and preserving its pure theology, to give us the Bible in the shining robes of poetry. And then, blessed be the great master artists, who have in their own spirits found, and have given out unto us, the waving scales of melody, the mysterious chords of harmony, the evervarying, ascending and descending vibrations whereon our pure Scripture poetry may be stretched, and where it may repose, and where it may speak to us, and quadruple its beauty, its longevity and its power. Music! poetry! truth! prayer! What significant memorabilia of the sanctuary! what a grand basis of religion! The gates of untruth can never prevail against a cause so deeply set in the nature of the human soul. 
               With plain and simple, yet with well-chosen words, that should convey the truth to the hearts of his people, Castlereagh prepared his sermons. They were neither long nor prosy sermons. If they were graceful, they were not merely ornamental. If they contained some fancies, yet were they far from things rhapsodical and vain. Wanting in rhetoric they seldom dom were, but they were not specimens of mere oratorical study. They were often, usually, original in the finest sense of the term, but they were, also, often enriched with quotations from other writers. They were affectionate and earnest; they were also logical and sound. Castlereagh believed that the sermon had a just and holy mission, as well as the prayer, as well as music and poetry and the Word. It was a painful idea to him that it might be of any materials and a thing by itself, unsound, illogical, absurd, self-contradictory and repulsive, or at least unimpressive, when all else in the sanctuary was full of grace and truth! "Beaten oil for the sanctuary," was his motto; and the oil was beaten often by help of the midnight lamp; yea, late into the morning even of the blessed day itself. Thus often work they themselves unfairly, the servants of Jesus Christ. 
               Castlereagh's Sabbath left him usually worn down in strength. But it was sweet to call together his family after early tea, and, ere the sun declined, attend to the exercises of devotion with them. With a family of twelve or fifteen boarding-pupils, his own household and the teachers, all numbering twenty or twenty-five persons, they formed a very pleasant and delightful circle, where he customarily presided, reading first two or three verses in the Scripture, and each one of the circle in his turn following till all had read. Then came the inquiry for the text, of one; the subject of the discourse, from another; some of the divisions, from a third; important truths, from another. After this came a full recital of the commandments, and verses of hymns by those who were to learn them. Then, accompanied by the melodeon, some appropriate hymn was sung, and prayer brought the exercises to a close. 
               Thus a full hour was often passed. Delightful hour to memory now! Oh! hour! hour! HOUR of evening prayer in the family school at Lindenvale. The memory of thee is now before my eye. I see the stranger with them. He is wiping the warm joy-tear away. I hear the happy voices of children, youth and age, praising and adoring God. I see them kneeling before Him. It is a group of loving and affectionate hearts. They have reposed from secular study, and have this day acquired religious knowledge. 
               After devotions, while Castlereagh was occupied with some preparations for his third public exercise, and often into the evening itself, Mrs. Castlereagh gathered the young pupils all around her, and faithfully studied out the Sabbath-school lesson for the next Sunday. 
               The children were all sent early to their night-slumbers on the Sabbath evening. Some of them attended the third service; others, especially the younger portion, chose to remain away, and were early sent with sleepy eyes to their pillows. 
               "I am tired-I am wearied out. I am faint and gone, gone, gone with these three efforts and labors," said Castlereagh, as he came home from the evening meeting. 
                
               "I knew you would be. I told you so, my dear," said his wife. "It is too much for you, and you will ruin your fine health if you do not adopt a different course." 
               "How can I? Pray, what course?" 
               "Oh! let it be now. Here is a bowl of good cool milk and warm mush, which you like, and some tea if you want." 
               "No-no." 
               "Well, the milk, then." 
               "Yes, yes, that is good. But what course?" 
               "Can you not let the church members carry on the third meeting?" 
               "They say they can not." 
               "Try them. Never were there better men to exhort and to pray. Why not?" 
               Castlereagh partook of his milk; and soon feeling refreshed, exclaimed, "Why, Matilda, I am strong now. I feel, if it were necessary, that I could even go and speak again." 
               "Oh! now that is too, too bad, husband. Thus perish all my hopes of even a little reform in you. I do firmly believe, and think it is my final belief, that, as your sister Emily once told you, 'you will kill yourself working for other people.'" 
               "Ha! Did little Emmie say that? Well-it may be so. Why should I not? Should I lie in an idle, useless posture!" 
               "Elbert Castlereagh, it can by no good meaning of language imply that you are in an idle and useless position, if, instead of being at your third meeting on Sabbath evening, it is said of you that you are at home with your family, or calmly reading in your study after the labors of the day, or even sound asleep for the night on your bed." 
               "Why, my dear wife, I don't know about all that." 
               "I know-and every body here says so. Every one seems to say you are doing too much." 
               "Oh! how can we do too much in a cause where the Saviour actually perished. If we die, we have him for our Leader." 
               "Yes; but the Saviour does not wish you to throw away, but to use to the best advantage, your life, as he did His life. He was repeatedly environed with difficulties, and his disciples were fearful on His account, but He says to them, 'My time is not yet.' In seasons of persecution, He bade them flee to other places. He sent them forth to exercise large prudence in publishing his Gospel. In a word, I do not think a modern preacher is called to throw himself into a coughing consumption, or to fasten on him the bronchitis, making necessary a voyage to Europe for a cure, or to preach himself into a chronic diarrhea or cholera, and in any manner to perish a martyr to an unnecessary class of exertions, in order to say with the more emphasis, 'I have the Saviour for my example and Leader!' No, I do not, Elbert." 
               "Well, I declare, I am more than half of your mind about it. But I do feel interested, and I want to do all that lies in my power for the good of souls." 
               "Yes, very true. But in the end, you may do more by doing less now." 
               Word was here brought to Sarah Matilda that Clifford wished to see her. She returned in a few minutes, and said that he was a good deal unwell. Castlereagh and Sarah sat up with him till two o'clock, when he obtained relief and slept. 
               Castlereagh was confined closely in his place to the school for the next two weeks, and when Clifford was at last able to relieve him, they crossed each other's paths, looking both of them as thin and cadaverous as though they had been without food or rest for at least three days and nights. 
               And so Castlereagh labored-went down, went up, ahead and astern, wearing and tearing out a life in deeds well done, but, from their very nature, heavily borne. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               WE SHALL DO MUCH GOOD AND GET RICH. 
               THE first term of the school came to the close in a violent snow-storm. Much had been done by teachers and pupils to prepare for the examination. The hall of the Institute had been decorated with evergreen; the platform carpeted; seats arranged for the accommodation of visitors, and the lamps disposed for the best effect for the exercises of the evening. There were to be an address by Castlereagh, music by the teachers and pupils, orations by the boys, and selections from the compositions of both sexes of pupils. 
               The morning was dull with clouds, and the day heavy with storm. In the evening, few came, or could, with convenience; although the pupils scolded, although the bell rang cheerily, and the lamps were all burning brightly, not twenty-five persons dared, or cared to breast the storm. 
               "Well, this is really a downright winter-setter," said Castlereagh, as he listened to the hoarse winds, and noticed the snow piling on the windows. 
                
               "Why couldn't it snow to-morrow, I wonder?" said Clifford. 
               "Patience, patience, Mr. Hayward," said Miss Halloway; "it does not snow merely for our benefit." 
               "No, it is for the benefit of that shouting sleigh-full gang, just gone along, eh?" 
               "Yes, and for old winter's honor. Is it not time that the hoary honors of the year should be put on?" 
               "Oh! fie, Miss Halloway; do you call a snow-storm the honor of winter?" 
               "To be sure I do. What is winter to us without it? We boast to our Southern friends of our snow-clad hills, and frozen streams. Surely, half the idea of a northern winter is a snow-bank and a sleigh-ride. Give me the distant view of snow-clad mountains; let me hear the ringing of the sleigh-bells. These I desire in the season of them, and in their highest perfection!" 
               "Oh! ho! you are a lover of winter truly." 
               Miss Halloway gave him a cheerful smile, and answered, "A great admirer and venerator of the old-fashioned, hard, driving and drifting snow-storm am I." 
               "Well, give me the sunny clime of the South-I don't like these freezing atmospheres and these perpetual storms." 
               "The sunny South hath, doubtless, attractions-" 
               "Nay!-nay! I am speaking of the skies." 
               "And I, of human cheeks and eyes. Hark!" 
                
               "The hour has arrived for the exercises to commence," said Castlereagh. Immediately all the pupils arose, and Clifford, seating himself at the piano, played, while they all sung a joyful welcome to the school. 
               The pupils, numbering seventy-five', were all present, and about twenty-five visitors. These formed, after all, something of an audience, and most of the exercises were gone over. Yet Hayden refused to speak before so meager a collection, and looked daggers all the evening. Some others pouted, and many dismalized over the storm. But, on the whole, the evening passed happily away, and, when all was over, the bell rang as merrily as for a fire, and as wildly. The boys leaped into the snow-banks. The girls hurried into their sleighs, and other vehicles, and by and by all was still. The first term of Castlereagh Institute was closed. 
               Sarah Matilda had prepared a beautiful entertainment of fruit and sweetmeats for the boarding-misses, who now all came in and partook of it in the highest glee. Even Hayden recovered his good-humor, acknowledged his fault, and desired it might be forgiven; and all the boys and girls begging for him, he was received again into favor. 
               And now the holiday vacation was at hand. Teachers and pupils exchanged many a "merry Christmas" and "happy New Year" beforehand, and separated for the fortnight with a comical mingling of tears and smiles, of sad regrets and joyous anticipations. The sun shone forth, in dazzling splendor, over the unbroken surface of the earth's fair covering, promising a welcome respite to the now dispersing inmates of Lindenvale Parsonage, and a happy return to its pleasant shades and occupations. 
               Castlereagh was, on the whole, pleased with the review of the term, and with the object he had undertaken to accomplish. Yet he, in truth, confessed that it was a difficult matter to carry out in all its details. It had in itself the promise of usefulness, but the poetry and romance of the enterprise grew less striking than at the first: it was eminently a practical, everyday department of labor. "However," said he; "we shall do good, and get rich. There is do doubt of it. We shall teach these boys and girls the whole science of numbers, the history of the world, the great system of language, the power of thought, natural science, the fine arts, and practical business. With these we shall combine purely moral and mental philosophy, and arrive, by regular sequences, at the first great knowledge of the soul( the Holy Spirit aiding and blessing us)-the existence of a benevolent God and Creator, and his son Jesus Christ our Lord, whom, to know aright, is eternal life. We must aim at this knowledge even from the first. I will, I must, I desire to. If I fail of every other thing, let me not, oh! God, fail of this. 
               "As for riches, I am pretty sure of them also. It is always the case, that a man becomes more or less wealthy, who goes earnestlyinto any good business, and manages it with care. When we are rich, if weary of teaching, we will build us a large, fine house, in a sweet grove, near a beautiful stream, or lake, where there are delightful grounds, fine rambles, delicious views, accommodating and intelligent neighbors; in a healthy climate, where it will be invigorating to ride abroad, or to labor on our grounds. We will strive to do good; we will give to the poor, to the benevolent societies, and pass our life calmly and piously to its sun-down." 
               Did ever miserly churl even, think such good thoughts as these, before the time of Castlereagh? 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IX. 
               THE BELL HAS A ROPE, AND THAT GETS TIED.-JOURNAL.-LETTERS. 
               THE newspapers, far and near, were filled with a magniloquent advertisement of the second term of the Lindenvale Institute. Its location was given in respect to its vicinity to cities, rail-roads, and places of classical interest and importance. The advantages of the Institute for classical, practical, and ornamental acquisitions were duly set forth, and references of the highest character given. The names of teaches in all the branches were duly set in capital letters, and the public assured that Mr. and Mrs. Castlereagh, presiding over the whole institution, and especially interested in the general character it sustained, as favoring the interests of learning and the best progress of the pupils in their charge, no fears need be entertained that they would fail of good scholarship and rapid improvement. 
               Indeed all this was said with sincerity. Castlereagh determined to give every pupil under his care the very best education in his power, and to reform every evil habit and every vicious way of life he might detect in any of them. 
                
               Fully impressed with these views, he himself labored industriously to bring those results to pass. He devoted more and more time and expense to the school. Hours, days, weeks, and months, were passed by him in diligent, and often exhausting exertions, to carry out his plans, and to make his school worthy of the public patronage, and favorable for the development of the youthful intellect. Above all, he strove to awaken the moral sense, and to lead his beloved pupils to the pursuit of that heavenly knowledge, which is of chief value. In these efforts passed the spring, the summer, the autumn again, and winter scenes a second time, and so on. Two full years closed over him, and we shall learn something of them from the following extracts from a journal kept during the time: 
               
                  April 6.-Our second examination has come off with great l, having the advantage of fine weather and traveling. Our rooms were crowded, especially at the evening's entertainment. The speakers and musicians did themselves great credit; our patrons seemed much gratified, and all bids fair for a pleasant summer term. 
               
                  June 18.-Most of our family and the larger day scholars have been out on a long botanical excursion. Though fatigued, they have evidently passed a happy afternoon. What a desirable recreation! 
               
                  July 2-The boys are begging leave to fire off small cannons as well as crackers around the libertypole on the 4th.-I must consider this. 
                
               
                  Sept. 29.-How could I help it? Miss Halloway, whom we all admired, whose sweet voice, whose kindly smile, whose easy, graceful manners were our frequent theme of praise-whose presence was ever welcome, preferred to leave us on a roving visit to her distant friends. We besought her to stay with us, the pupils clung around her, and made her ever-green garlands and choice presents; but, alas! the hour came for the parting, waving of handkerchiefs, and suffused eyes. We have not yet heard from her. 
               We have now in her place, Miss Ellen Irving Merrick, whom we greatly esteem. She has a strong, energetic character, though she is excessively modest and taciturn. She is not Miss Halloway, but she is herself. We have lost the one and gained the other. We shall see. She has made a good impression, so far. 
               
                  Jan. 15.-I am worn down with care and labor. Clifford, my poor brother, is half sick much of the time. He will not say so, but we can see it-feel it, The doctor has compelled him to his chair in the school. Monsieur Tourn, the French teacher, has left me suddenly, for France, in the hope of a new revolution. I tried to calm him, and persuade him to wait a mouth. "Non, non," said he, and away he sped. And so Josephine Leland is married to Lieutenant Henry Sickles, of the army. I fear he is too gay, and a spendthrift. Sarah Matilda is more hopeful. She is proud of her pupil. 
                
               
                  April 5.-How on earth can we get through with the examination? Here we are in a pretty fix: the boys are quarrelsome, the teachers sick, the programme not made out, myself driven night and day-nervous, irritable, and confused; Sarah Matilda half vexed, and the cooks in a hurry, and boarders grumbling-whew! 
               
                  April 6.-What is to pay, Fitz Maurice? 
                
                  Fitz Maurice. 
                  The boys have tied up the bell-rope and concealed the ladder to the scuttle. 
                
                
                  Castlereagh. 
                  Who? What? Where are they? 
                
                
                  F. Maurice. 
                  I don't know, sir. They all say they are innocent. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I must stop this. Who of the boys is malcontent-the most vicious and rebellious, Fitz Maurice? 
                
                
                  F. Maurice. 
                  Indeed I don't know, sir. They are all clever enough, but full of mischief, just now. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Send in Hayden, here; and, by the way Fitz, say nothing. Work the knot out, if you can, and ring for school. 
                
               "I wonder what has led to this. Something don't go right. I must have pushed the boys too hard in algebra yesterday, or plagued them in Csar. Hark! there is Hayden's tread. Now let's see. Smooth down face, and look awful clever. Ah! good-morning, Hayden 
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Good-morning, sir. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You see, Hayden, Mr. Hayden is sick, Monsieur Tourn has left us, and Sturges, the drawing-master master, is absent-can you give those lessons to the class till he returns? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Don't think it possible, hardly, sir. Do you? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  No difficulty, I fancy. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Don't know enough, that's all. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Oh! I'll risk you. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  I had rather not. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I know-but to oblige, you see, and help out of this pinch? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  True, there's a pinch. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  But it will soon get by. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Yes. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Oh, to be sure. Clifford will be well in a few days, and Sturges back directly, and Miss Merrick will resume to-morrow. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Very well. Perhaps it won't hurt me to help as well as I can. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  All right, all right, Hayden; and-and-ah! by the way, keep a little lookout for misdemeanors; eh? Hayden; eh? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Yes, sir.
                   
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  By the way, look our for Joel Crawford and Charlie Howe; they are rather bent- 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  I will keep a true bill, sir, and- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Don't magnify little things, Hayden. Just keep things straight, that's all-that's all. See that the bell is in order, and rung in time; eh, Hayden? 
                
                
                
                  Hayden (with a start, and some color). 
                  The bell, sir? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Only about the bell, Hayden-the rope, you know; eh? 
                
                
                  Hayden (all right). 
                  Oh! yes, perfectly; the bell is important, and so is the rope. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You could n't, I suppose, manage to see when it happened to get into-a-say, if you please, a hard knot? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  The easiest thing in the world, sir, were it not for my studies that press rather hard on me at present. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  True; you are hard pressed in Csar, Hayden? 
                
                
                  Hayden (Slightly coloring.) 
                  Somewhat so, sir. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  And algebra 
                
                
                  Hayden, 
                  Algebra is very long, sir. The class is rebellious. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I can let up a little, if necessary. But you know we must get on as far as possible by examination. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  If you will condescend to shorten up a page, all will be right, and so it is now, if you say so-but- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Oh! perfectly-I understand. Well, be it so. I will. Hark! there's the bell! 
                
                
                  Hayden (Hastily.) 
                  Sure enough. How in the world- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  What? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Fitz Maurice, sir- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  About him? 
                
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Yes, sir-all right. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You were saying "Fitz"- 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  True; merely that-er-Fitz- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Yes? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  That he said the rope was in a knot. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You are sure that he told you so? eh, Hayden? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Yes, sir-or that is, he told one of the boys. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Ah, ha! yourself or one of the boys. Can't recollect, I take it, which? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Not exactly. But I believe he told me, and then Joel, and then Charlie Howe, and so on. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Very well, my boy. The rope has been in a knot, it seems, and somebody's guilty. Can you cipher it out? You don't know any thing about it yourself? Come, now, fairly, Hayden? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  The rope is always snarling- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Fitz says it was tied.
                   
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  So I understand. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Do you suppose it tied itself, Hayden? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  It's a curious rope, any how, and you see it goes through five or six pullies in this way-so-and thus-and so on; and when it gets under full headway, away goes the rope into the loft, and coils round the pulley, thus; and then when you jump up and catch the end of the rope by the ceiling, and pull down, it's almost sure to take a whirl over the pulley, and slip off in a tremendous hard, stiff, terrible knot, and I shouldn't wonder a bit if it did so this very time-only- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Ah! only? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Only-yes-well, that's about the whole. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  It is a very curious rope-very-very-and pullies, too-they are curious-very-very. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Very- 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Very! 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Never saw any thing more so in my life. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Does the rope ever untie itself in the same way? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Doubtful, I think, about that. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You think it doubtful, do you? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Almost certain, sir, it never does. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Well, so am I. Your explanations of the mishap is a very ingenious one-ought I to say natural? But the rope got in a knot to-day before the bell was rung at all. We had no "wake-up," no "prayer-bell." Somehow or other it contrived itself into this shape during the night. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Of that, of course, the boys being asleep, would know very little. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Yes, very little! 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  I heard no noise, sir, in my quarters. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Well, Hayden, the bell-rope being in this condition, you couldn't tell me any thing more about it-how it came so, eh? Have you any idea that Joel tied it? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Oh, no, sir. 
                
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Or Fitz Maurice? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  DAre say not. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Or Amos? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  No, sir.
                   
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Or George, or Hurlburt, or Charles, or Thomas? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  They are all as ignorant of it as I am, sir. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  And you? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  Me! sir. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You? 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  I. sir 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Yes. 
                
                
                  Hayden. 
                  If one of them will testify that I did it, I'll admit the offense, otherwise, pardon me, sir, no disrespect to you-I will not. (Exeunt omnes.)
                   
                
               
                  April 8.-Miss Merrick is again at her post. Sturges suddenly appeared to day, and things begin to brighten. 'Tis certain Clifford can not return, and we must do without him, albeit the new teachers poorly supply his place. No clew to the rogue who tied the bell-rope. Evidently it was Hayden. The ball which was missing has been found in the rabbit burrow, under the straw. Probably the rabbits took it there! The inkstand that was taken away and filled with sand, has been restored with ink. I was under the painful necessity of calling three of my lads into the recitation-room to-day, and severely reprimanding them for their coarse, even profane language. How it embitters my peace to have occur these dark days in my life. How dreadful is it in the young to acquire this awful habit of profanity! We have very little of it, I fancy; there should be none of it. But it is possible more wicked, terrible words of sin are spoken than I ever can know. Alas! the little boys, my own Johnnie and Hobbie, will not they hear them, catch them, repeat them? Tremendous idea! It must be, it shall be rooted out of the school. There are slang phrases I do not like, which some of the boys use as commonly as they speak, such as "by George;" go it, boots;" "2: 40;" "you old fool;" "you can't come it;" "you lie;" "go to grass;" "you did;" "I didn't;" "thunderation;" "the fury;" "let her slide." All these phrases and terms, I utterly repudiate, and check the offender whenever I hear him, but alas! is not Satan, the great Deceiver and "Murderer from the beginning' at work in their young hearts? They catch at these words almost by instinct, and bristle up in little boyish wrath against each other, using them as men use even heaviest curses and blasphemies. I can but think my rules respecting profanity, and very oft-repeated exhortations to avoid it, are to a great extent observed by the pupils, and that very few of them-indeed that none of my boarding pupils accustom themselves to the dreadful habit. Yet I do not like these other expressions. They are coarse. They are ungentlemanly. they are boys' profanity; may I be able to do it all away. 
                
               
                  April 20-Well. we breathe again. Let me be grateful that the examination has passed so well. We are now rejoicing in our own little family circle. Let's see. We are now but seven. Our large dining-tables are pushed back, and we gather around a small square table and reach to every part of it for what we want. Johnnie begs to be the papa, and serve the meat, Hobbie hopes he will some time do the same, and even now, can help to potatoes and fill the glasses with water. He not unfrequently dashed the water in too abundantly, and floods the neighborhood; but that was an "ackident," and "hopes it will be better next time." Gertrude yawns and says it is lonesome, and wishes Fitz Maurice had not also gone. "If Fitz were here," says she, "we would climb Bluff rock. or walk to the sea-shore." "We will go, Gertrude." say both the children. "I will go any where to see the cars," says Hobbie. "Oh!" say I, "you are my little engineer, ha?" 
               "Yes, sir; 2: 40." (Here it is in my own family! 2: 40!) 
               "Oh! Hobbie, fie! fie!" says his mother. 
               Mina and Ellen, the girls, are busy-fingered, brightening up the silver, and the rooms. Fitz Maurice has gone for a short visit to a relative's in Harrodsburg. 
               As for myself, I am free to confess that I am very dull, very languid, very restless, very lazy. We have but two weeks vacation. Three or four days already gone. I have simply "hung around" without accomplishing plishing any sermonizing, any calls, any study. It is dull, horrible to live so. Where is sister Blanche, the busy, light-hearted, blues-dissolving Blanche? Oh, yes, she too has left us, and is, I doubt not, threading Broadway, or catching the inspiration of song, as it is warbled forth and poured out in the great goblets of music by Jenny Lind. I retire at eight, at nine, at half past nine: rise at seven-half-eight-oh, awfulness! My neighbors rise at four, five, and six. This is a queer way of life. this vacation-life. I must turn over a new leaf in it. 
               
                  April 22.-I have received twelve hundred and forty dollars for my last term. Have paid Saccharine, the grocer, two hundred; Homer, the bookseller, one hundred; Hyde, the hatter and shoemaker, thirty; Help in the house, fifty; Cole, the anthracite, forty; Bones, the meat-man, seventy-five; Omnes, varietates, etc., etc., one hundred; Surety's paper at the bank, one hundred and fifty; and Scholasticorum arum, four hundred. Heigho! Let's see. Ah! I have it, eleven hundred, forty-five dollars. Great speculation this, truly. What, only a hundred dollars left! Scholastic drift! Why, this won't do. This don't pay. After paying off all bills, notes, and expenses, left me but ninety-five dollars. I must put up these tution bills. We can't possibly live so. There is a pleasant side, a dark side, and, perhaps, a neuter side to teaching. Dark side is the running in debt, bad scholars, slow progress, discipline, disappointments, and vexations. Neuter side is the halfdreamy state that you are in when hoping against hope, in the case of a dull grade of pupils, and when telling their parents that they are a very fair set of scholars, promising to do something smart in the world. The pleasant side is the indescribable surface of smoothness. Here every thing glides on so devoid of friction, that you seem too happy ever to stop. You look on your whole school with the administration of a millionaire on his ships and marble-blocks-an accountant on his found, trial-balance-an editor on his favorite dish. The pleasant side is also the after-thought. You look on what you have done. Oh! blessed result. Oh! the reality. Behold the giant intellects you have trained. There goes a genius. Yonder is a statesman. Here in his ermine is a chancellor. And addressing a multitude on the brow of Bunker's Hill, near the granite obelisk, is a WEBSTER, great American orator. "Young man," said Webster, to a student at Yale, when he once visited the college, and was introduced to the students, "if I could do as much for you, as your father, when my tutor at Dartmouth, did for me. I should be inconceivably happy." Here in the solemn shades of the sanctuary is the legate of the skies, proclaiming gracious words, and doing work for future ages. Here are the happy, intelligent circles in the private walks and usual ways of life. Blessed result-the pleasant-the good side this. And here it is, that all vexations, and even poverty itself self, are forgotten. We have done, and are doing duties, great, important, responsible DUTIES. The memory of them nerves us for greater things, and gives us a whole life's running stream of after-thought. Grid us then anew for the strife, the neuter, the dark, the pleasant side. In them are glorious reminiscences, scholastic under-drift, and upward and onward, a mark upon the world, whole pages of names great and good, wise and benevolent. Yes, we will see our pupils by and by, our little ragged and wild boys-our blushing and pretty-eyed girls-our young mathematicians, linguists, orators-our sweet musicians, writers, and poets, we shall yet see them among the foremost ranks of great and good men and notable women, and so the name of HARRIET BEECHER STOWE shall come up never more to die. When the Albany Convention was in session and voted to raise a church erection fund of fifty thousand dollars, and a BOWEN was named as a donor to it of ten thousand, it happened that a little cluster of persons sat in the gallery of the church overlooking the platform, and among them was a lady in black, rather passed the meridian of life. Mr. Bowen addressed the convention a few words. Thirty years (more or less) had come over him, but still the lady there knew him, she remembered him as the little boy of her school, away in the eastern part of Connecticut, then but ten years of age. She had been an instrument in the training of a heart that by and by should be found to beat in kindly sympathy with religion and with the poor of Christ's Church on earth. Blessed be the memory of J-,
                     J-, which stands for Ha***s.
                   my own early instructor. Clara et memorabile nomen! In his advanced life, infirm, yet still oft teaching his half day, anon the whole day, he has the pleasant side prospect of a thirty years' retrospect of this sort. His pupils, men and women now, are found all the globe over, ministers at the altar, missionaries afar off among the heathen, lawyers, statesman, merchants, artists, yeomanry, "the solid men of Boston," New Yorkers, Western enterprisers, where and who are they not? Such a man lives not, nor labors he, in vain. He holds the FERULE of society. When falls the blow, the blister comes it is so much bad blood thrown off the vitals, otherwise condensed for future "stratagems and spolis." When he the ear pulls, it is the tingling twing of a future conscience in the man-a safer man that ear-pulled boy! Don't maim, don't blood the boys. No, no; that won't do. Don't tyrannize, don't wantonly provoke them. Be their friend, their confidant; but by all means govern them, gain them, get their respect. Train them up and on, on, on into those regions whence they will clearly see that you were their best friend, and so ever call you, the good, the sagacious, the firm, faithful teacher, looking well, lest they, perchance, neglected, should perish on the lee shore of rough life, and owe you nothing but their scorn and hate. By all means teach them something. If it is the spelling lesson, reading, writing, grammar, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish, German, oh! let if be taught. Let it be understood. Make real, not nominal scholars. Hood, in his Whimsicalities, has shown how little worth was it to Miss Priscilla Crane, or her younger sister, Ruth, teachers at "Lebanon House Establishment for Young Ladies," though, as the housemaid, Sally, tells us, they were "a pleasuring on a tower up the Rhind," to have all their life dabbled in books which they themselves neither understood nor taught aright to others. "Bad French," no German, stiff, starched, and prudes in all they did know, they appeared better at home than abroad, "the front gate locked at five P. M.," and nobody to trouble them.

                     LINDENVALE, April 25, 18- 
                     "DEAR MADAM-
                   
                  "I am sorry to hear of you such bad news. Why could you not stop the horse before he became so furious? Why did you not rein him to the wall, and then leap from the carriage? It seems to me that you were, though bold and firm, not very wise in the course which you adopted. You say that, finding him very restive, and hard on the bit, you struck him with the lash to subdue him; and finding him more unmanageable, you held him in the middle of the road, with a steady, firm rein, and let him go. In the first place, allow me to say, that although the whip is sometimes useful in such cases, yet it requires a very strong arm, and skill in the use of the rein, to manage an excited horse. I am glad that you did not throw down the reins, scream, and then faint; but as you were thrown out so violently and received such a sprain, I am sorry that you did not, as the jockeys say, 'saw him up'-the best, and indeed the only method I know, by which to bring up a hard and uneasy horse. Just hold him tight in the rein, and violently jerk first one rein, and then the other, by which maneuver the bits are pulled from his clenched teeth against his lips, and he is rendered powerless by the pain. Pray you try it the next occasion that offers. We are happy, after making all allowance for the high coloring you bestow on your injury and convalescence, to conclude it highly probable you might have been, and might now be worse. We shall see you in a day or two if possible. Commend me to the children. I hope they are having a vacation of overflowing happiness. As for ourselves, we begin to tire of it, especially as a two days' rain has kept me a prisoner in my study. You shall see my sermon, though written under these (call them if you please) favoring circumstances. I think it can not fail to meet your approval. If so, I will trust it may do good, yet alas! how many sermons have I preached with joy and hope, and confidence, that have fallen on the barren soil of human depravity, and brought forth no fruit to perfection. Wasted sermons these, in which I trusted there was power sufficient to enkindle, by divine grace, a holy love to God in the bosoms of multitudes. So have I given to children; they have repeated them to me, and heard my explanation, and then have gone out and forgotten them-apparently wasted efforts, apparently stereotyped human dullness. And yet, that dear old disciple, the simple-hearted, and meek, and godly uncle Eldad, living in the red cottage by the road-side, a mile south of me, where two tall elms throw their arms above the roof, and in summer, give a mellow shading to the picture-life of love and quiet there enjoyed, has wept, and anon smiled over my sermons, and gone the weary mile, oft in his lameness, by the help of a staff and the love of Christ, to hear them and to worship. With Bible in his hand, he has passed the whole morning of a day, at home in his cottage-hall, weeping over its truth, and welcoming me with warmest Christian solicitation. Why should I despair? Is it that so many hear and yet are not attentive-are not saved? But in like manner treated they these sons of men, the Light that came into the world. They knew Him not, they received Him not; and yet John's Gospel was not in vain; and unto God are not they labor in love, a sweet savor of Christ, in them not only that are saved, but also in them that perish? And some, yea, many are saved, and they will sing the Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! of the ransomed hosts on high. Uncle Eldad died in peace, full of the faith he was a child of God. It is then sweet, and it is a rich remuneration on earth, even, to write and preach sermons, although by multitudes they are heard with listless ears and unaffected hearts. Neither ought I to forget that precious work of Divine grace in our school, the particulars of which are familiar to you; by which at one time, as I judge, forty of the pupils were more or less affected, and a goodly number were led to sit at the feet of the Saviour, and consecrate themselves to His service. Those last days of the term, when teachers and pupils were seen to weep and rejoice together, and prayer was heard, and praise abounded, never should they be forgotten; they were surpassingly interesting; and in them the grace of God was magnified. But, alas! spiritual apathy takes now the place of life and joy in the Holy Ghost. So we drift. Now on the high waves and tides of success, anon sinking into the undertow, and borne down and afar off, helpless and despairing. 
                  "Clifford judging it prudent to remain in New York for a time on account of his health, I have had three different teachers following each other in his place; one remained a week, another a few days longer, the third one helped us through. Having written to Clifford, two days since, inquiring if he was disposed to return and assist us next term, I have to-day received the following, by telegraph: 'Dear sir-I am disposed to return, but circumstances forbid it.' This is harassing. I must now give up the hope of his services through the summer. Where I shall find a proper person to succeed him I know not. But there is, I think, some prospect of my being successful in applying to the Reverend Gustavus Racey, a young, devoted, talented minister, at present less able to preach than to engage in the business of teaching. I have applied to four or five different persons, highly recommended to me (anticipating Cliffords reply), but have not received a favorable answer, save from Gustavus Racey. It is true, I received a note from a person residing at a distance, who, from the fact of his belonging to the Scholasticus-a-um, I had reason to think well qualified to be a teacher. But this letter to me was any thing but recommendatory of his scholarship. The writing was bad, the spelling bad, the ideas loosely joined together. My disappointment and mortification were extreme; but I gave him up, and sought elsewhere. If Racey comes, all will be well: if not, why-there it is-I must, though you and Sarah Matilda insist against it, go into the works myself. And thus it is that we make the scholastic drift. You will rejoice with me that the excellent, pious, and beloved Miss Merrick, too good for earth, and not long for it, I sometimes ruminate, will return to pass the summer with us, and again have the care of your own sweet Stella. May she be able to infuse into her young and vivacious heart much of that holy, blessed spirit of piety with which she seems to have been furnished in an eminent degree. The younger sister, Rosetta, will be with us also-a lovely and talented girl. We shall have with us again your own young town-friend, the kind, studious, and exemplary Clarissa Rockwell, and some others. But some anon. Tell Hayden that I must have a set of his white Bantams, and will give him a pair of Johnnie's white and black rabbits.

                     "AT HOME, LINDENVALE, April 26. 
                     "DEAREST S.-
                   
                  "'Home' were no word-charm but for thee; but wherever thou hast impressed thyself, either on my heart or 'home,' there thou art, and there I can abide in peace. I hope you received my letter by the last post (modern-mail). In the postscript I mentioned a ramble that I took the day previous, which, by good English measurement, was equal to ten miles. Fitz Maurice accompanied me. We visited, in our excursion, the wild ravine in Richmond, where, as you will remember, we once had a most happy pic-nic. I have almost forgotten who accompanied us. Let me see if I can recall and name them: 
                  "There was your father, the good and valiant Colonel Hayward, who would have been a warrior, if, in his colonelship, the war had existed; your mother, as gay as her daughters, and still in the prime of her life, careful of all; there were the four sisters-Blanch, Agnes, Effie, and Louisa, who is now asleep in Greenwood wood; your brothers, Clifford and Montague, were present; Gertrude and Johnnie, also (Hobbs, the baby, and Mina were left at home) Olivia-, and her friend, Miss Carter, and our two young clericals, Reverend Tracy Sherwood, Pricipal of Richmond High School, and Reverend Zelotes Mason, the elegant classical divine and sweet musician. Besides these and ourselves, I do not recall any. What a load for pony Nelly, of the feeble, the young, the jars and baskets! By what various paths, in separate clusters, gayly chatting, we at last concentrated in the wild and picturesque glen, and there, far up the creek among the rocks and wild shades, pitches our rude tent, and spread our ample repast. 
                  "Do you remember the danger Sherwood run of falling into a deep place in the creek, in consequence of slipping on the smooth surface of a rock? Three times he leaped desperately across the chasm, and each time struck a little below the point where he could avail himself of the true 'line of direction,' and, sliding backward, again sprung for the opposite side. The fourth time (and the whole series transpired in a quarter of a minute), by great dexterity and exertion, he touched a safe spot, and sank panting to the ground. Who of the party was it that lost his porte-monnaie? Who dulled my best ax? Who wet his feet at the crossing? Who lost a beautiful collar? Who was not excessively weary on reaching home? 
                  "There are yet some traces remaining of the bower we hastily constructed, by the side of the creek beneath the tall trees; but the rude tables have been long ago washed away by the floods, and one can hardly visit the spot but with melancholy sensations. Did I mention to you in my letter any thing about the gold mine once opened in the immediate vicinity of our picnic encampment? Well, it is of little consequence if I did not. But Fitz and I found it by dint of preservance and hard climbing. It is on the hill side, rather to the east of the pleasure-ground. A sharp ascent has to be made to it; and bushes and rubbish put aside and surmounted; and a very sharp look-out kept up, or the 'mine' will remain undiscovered. When you reach it, there is a large, rough formation of earth, and well overgrown with trees and brush, that appears like one of nature's formed hillocks, but it is, in reality, the earth thrown out in sinking the shaft. The impression that gold could be found there led to the excavation, soon after the Revolution; miners from Germany worked the shaft in and downward, over eighty feet. They discovered galena and silver in considerable quantities, and also copper; but, failing to strike a golden vein, or to find a modern 'placer,' they abandoned the enterprise. Since then it has been partially resumed, once or twice, but it is now, and has been for more than thirty years, entirely abandoned; it is, in a great measure, filled up, and with difficulty discovered. Notwithstanding the failure of the party who sought for the precious metals there, I am perfectly satisfied, from my examination of this whole region in company with your uncle, General H-, that silver, lead, copper, sulphur, and even gold, abound in considerable quantities all along the hills; the copper region extending indefinitely far to the north. In our walk we likewise visited the old parsonage and grounds where our first happy years of domestic life were enjoyed, and drank from the old well, out of the old oaken bucket, the family being absent from the house. Following the wild and meandering little brook, through the woods, we came to the 'seven giants', those tall chestnuts all growing together from one common parent root, and forming a hollow tube, by their united growth, of sufficient diameter to contain a dozen persons. There they remain, unmolested, and I fancied, seldom visited, for the old paths we trod to them were almost obliterated. 
                  "We also called on several of the families in the neighborhood, and were most hospitably entertained. On our return we visited the old oak-tree, on the hill top that overlooks the harbor, the city and Lindenvale. How often have we rode beneath its far-spreading branches. It is truly a majestic tree. I once measured it carefully, in company with Montague. At the surface of the ground we found it over (I think) twenty-eight feet in circumference, and, six feet from the ground, about nineteen feet. Some of the branches were six and seven feet in circumference, and the diameter of the shade they cast was over one hundred feet. It is an old land-mark to pilots, as it is seen along the coast for many miles. The owner of it once approached it, with his men, to cut it down for wood. But on learning that it was a well-known land-mark to sailors, generously allowed it to stand. Vigorous, hale, and hearty, there may it stand, 'the brave old oak,' a hundred years to come. 
                  "On the return home, we made our way down the rocks and through the wild grove of trees to see the whole of the beautiful waterfall that, from the road-side, dashed down into the valley, and waters 'THE FARM.' The recent rains had filled the creek to its highest capacity, and down rushed the water in varied forms of beauty, sublimity, and power. From the little lawn above, over which it fell in an even, dark outline, it is, perhaps, two hundred feet to the level below. And over rocks, in perfect foam, and in cascades of beauty, and through boiling raceways and pits it comes sweeping down to you, and passes on, soon gliding, meandering, silvering away into the broader stream that transports it to the harbor. 
                  "Weary, yet pleased with our ramble, we reached home, and found Gertrude anxiously awaiting us, having prepared an early supper. The vases in the back parlor are now filled with blue, pink and white anemones, running pine, and trailing arbutos, which we brought with us as mementoes and trophies. We also procured, in our excursion, some fine specimens of iron pyrites, galena, lime, slate, mica, feldspar, serpentine marble, asbestos and traprock. Fitz Maurice is enthusiastic this evening in his description of the day's adventures; and Gertrude seems to have many regrets that she did not accompany us. He assures her that he remembers perfectly the direction to every place we visited, and says he will drive her over the route whenever she wishes it. He is anxious to enter college in the fall. I tell him to wait another year. It is astonishing how the boy has made headway in his studies the past season. 
                  "Alice is doing well. She sustained no fatal injury by her fall from the carriage, and yet it is every body's wonder. She was thrown among large rocks, and struck the only green and soft place that happened to be there, or she would have been, I doubt not, killed instantly. I shall join you at your father's in Twenty-fifth street, to-morrow evening. Love to the boys.

               CHAPTER X. 
               ELEANOR, AND MANY OTHERS, INCLUDING HARRY OTIS AND HAYDEN.-THE ELOHIM AND LOGOS. 
               THE Summer Term of the Institute commenced with Gustavus Racey as the first teacher. Every body was pleased with Gustavus. His countenance expressed goodness, his words were kind, his piety marked and exemplary. He was tall, gentlemanly, easy, polite. A set of rich, sparkling black eyes illumined his face; and a massive shock of well-toileted hair of the same color ornamented his caput. An unbroken circle of pure white teeth smiled between his lips. His cheeks were unadorned with bushy beard, not did his lip boast either mustache or "imperial." 
               No soiled collar or tattered cravat ever claimed any familiarity with his throat and neck. His carriage was easy, his tread firm and dignified. In company, he was rather retiring and modest, but perfectly self-possessed, it being seldom, if ever, that he was caught "napping," either by pupils, or dashing belles and blades. 
               It was not long ere the school felt his presence; and although, at the first, there was some murmuring because cause of Clifford's absence, eventually he secured the attachment of all. 
               There came a letter to Castlereagh a few days previous to the commencement of the term, couched in the following language: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "S--, April 30, 185- 
                              "MR. CASTLEREAGH,-
                            
                           "DEAR SIR: If it may be allowed me, who am to yourself a stranger, to address you these few lines-and they contribute at all toward the great desire of my heart to enter your Seminary as one of your pupils-I shall deem myself one of the most fortunate of girls. My parents are willing that I should leave home for a time in order to attend to my studies still further; and I can leave a younger sister with them in my place; but my father does not possess the means at present to assist me, nor is he very hopeful for the future. I have been teaching a school the past, winter, and have reserved a little money, which I intend to appropriate toward the payment of the school-bills, as far as it will go; but unless I can, through your assistance, procure board in some private family at a reduced price, I fear that I can not pay your tuition and the board-bills. I am perfectly willing to do sewing, or other work, in part payment of my board; and you may be able to offer me some position in your school (after a time), by which my tuition will be reduced. If you can render me any assistance, without too much trouble, I need scarcely assure you, that I shall most kindly accept it, and cheerfully avail me of the chance thus presented to enter your school. I am now seventeen years of age, and desire to prepare myself to be a teacher. Please to answer this, if it will not be too much trouble or inconvenience, that I may hear from you on Saturday next. 
                           
                              "Respectfully yours, 
                              "ELEANOR --."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               No sooner had Castlereagh read the letter than he put aside his sermon for the next Sabbath, and, as he had often done before on similar applications, sallied out to undertake the office requested of him so earnestly and appropriately. After several applications, he succeeded in finding a most desirable situation and wrote her to that effect, in the letter assuring her that the tuition should be reduced one half. 
               She entered the school at the commencement of the term, a tall, pale, interesting girl, and by her consistent deportment, constant application, energy of character, and goodness of heart, gained the regard if her teachers and schoolmates. She was not long in revealing her merit as a fine writer. Miss Hillhouse having left the school, we could not at first detect the anonymous writer of some beautiful poetry in the "Classical Miscellany," written and published by the young ladies and gentlemen of the school. By and by it was traced to Eleanor's pen, which was afterward frequently employed ployed more publicly for the interests of the school, and usually with very great satisfaction. Castlereagh was not alone in weeping over her touching verses descriptive of the death of a young and beloved female friend. There was also much humor and facetiousness often displayed in her writings, but she was on the whole extremely sedate and serious. She entered the Institute on the following term, a regular boarding pupil, and assistant in the school for one or two hours each day.

               Among the bright and beautiful boys of the family, was Harry Otis Alexander-"Harry Otis" we called him. His father resided in the city of New York-a gentleman of education, business, wealth. He placed Harry Otis in the school to continue two or three years, and attend to mathematics, French, painting, and music, as well as to English branches generally. He was a lad twelve years of age, with an exceedingly slender frame, but possessing an active, energetic character. His face was round and delicate, with a decided feminine expression, in repose indicating a love of fun, and character to originate it, although there was an inoffensive, frankness of expression, and at times a softened shading of melancholy about his fine features. He was a favorite, as well in the school as in the family. Not unfrequently this circumstance came between him and some slight offense, and so proved of great service. He was usually industrious, and very successful in his studies. In music he had no formidable rival among the boys for the space of nearly three years, Hayden not choosing to be first, the only one of all the schoolboys who, perhaps, might in every branch have been his equal, and superior to most others. In mathematics his standing was respectable. He was a fine penman, a handsome reader, a very fine declaimer, and his progress in French was rapid and easy. At football few surpassed him, in climbing the mountains he found great pleasure, in skating and snow-plays he was ever a leader or joyous participator. Ever prompt in his duties, and ready to do kindnesses, he was, of course,
                   a favorite, and popular. Yet he was high-spirited. Pride often swelled his young heart. A high and rigid sense of honor kept his from low associations, and yet made it appear possible to lead him into danger under the appropriate temptations. Hayden and Harry Otis were unlike each other in many respects-the former a great wit, and careless in his studies; the latter a mimic to the perfect acting of any character, and a good student. They each had their respective followers and admirers, and though seldom sworn intimates, always more or less confederates. Both of them being of high families, and destined to an influential position in society, they naturally and easily treated one an other with considerable respect, even when they and their respective clans were at variance. 
               Harry Otis never seemed in a low, desponding vein; Hayden often retiring by himself, and seated on the grass beneath the trees, or on the terraces in front of the Institute, resting his elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, his face, to the eyes, being concealed by them, and his cap drawn down over his exceedingly fine forehead; and there, in half pouting, half meditating and easy mood, chewing over some fancy, or grief, or thought, the world knowing not what. Yet if in one of his brown studies, a fellow-student happening along, knocked off his cap, a tiger could not sooner spring on his prey than did Hayden on the unlucky offender, who generally paid the full cost of his temerity. In due time, accordingly, his "moods" came to be respected, and they usually ended by his stretching himself out at full length on the grass, rolling over two or three times, kicking his heels into the air, and springing to his feet; after which he seemed as merry as any body, and as eager for play, and as prompt at duty. Descended, on his father's side, from one of the most wealthy and illustrious families of one of the triad cities in the northerly part of the State of New York, and from which the city derived its name, his father a highly-accomplished clergyman of Albany, having died at the early age of twenty-seven, the boy had many objects of thought to engross his mind at such seasons, and he evidently sighed for the time to arrive when he could be his own man, untrammeled by the rigid customs of the school. He was adored by his sister Stella, and most fondly cherished by his mother, the widowed Alice. By her side he often sat up until midnight, engaged in reading aloud some favorite author, prosaic or poetic; or Stella, Hayden, and mother, played and sung alternately, the accompaniment being the melodeon, piano, or guitar. All played, all sang, all chatted-the widow and her two beautiful children; a widow at the early age of twenty-six; the children fatherless-the one but two or three years old at his father's decease, the other yet unborn! They all lived at the old maternal home of the mother, at Richmond, cared for and cherished by her aged and respected parents. 
               Harry Otis early lost his mother. Thus the boys could in some measure sympathize; and as they were both descended from families highly educated and respected, Castlereagh indulged many a bright hope respecting them. 
               Rosetta Merrick-sweet, gentle, even-minded, bright-eyed, black-eyed Rosetta! The very memory of thee is precious to us. She came with her eldest sister, and remained through the term, bearing away one of the highest prizes of the Institute. To her all seemed instinctively to attach themselves, especially Gertrude. How often they roved away, gathering the wild plants of the fields and forests, or to build their airy castles on the brow of Bluff Rock. Clarissa Rockwell was also one in the happy family, and her presence acted as a charm on the whole circle of the more youthful, repressing too great humor and levity, and awakening desires for improvement. With these was Miss Sophia Marmion, a beautiful, happy spirit of eighteen. Then with Stella there were Isabel and Roxenna, pretty girls and mischievous, who were not always agreeable to each other, but sometimes little secrets were for one's ear and not another's, and the injured party walked aside in no very pleasant mood. By and by it came her turn, and the cold shoulder was tipped to another. Anon, they were all happy together, and faithful. They all contrived many a pleasure-ramble with the lads, accompanied by one or another of their teachers, and fine chats were had as they wandered here and there, and many a throb of the young heart answered to deeds of special kindness shown, or to glances that were meant to be as special, too. 
               Fitz Maurice, Amos, Harry Otis, Hayden were pleasant companions for the girls and young misses, and good for battle-door and shuttle-cock, races, hoops, or "Hippodrome." And then, there was bright-eyed Stanton-who came into the family at this time-a good scholar, and a clever, ingenious lad, with an open, brilliant face, speaking the languages of all the kind emotions and good actions-a boy who could apppreciate the society of intelligent boys and girls, and add another to their happy circle. There was Holland, with his brawny shoulders, jet hair and eyes, and dark flashing face-from the distant Islands. His hands were busy in his pockets, and a neglected juvenility had made the kind bow awkward and dull. A descendant of the gallant general who commanded at the great battle of Navarino, Holland, though not long in the school, nor a ready scholar, made many a friend, and, when he left, though hidden in the Far-off West, his big heart swelling will make him, we trust, a noble man-it led him to send frequent letters to Castlereagh, breathing the kindest remembrances, and expressing the strong desire within him to return again to the shades of Lindenvale. Yet during his short sojourn there, Castlereagh, more than once, rushed between him and an antagonist, when their clinched fists and scowling features told him it was time to interrupt the brawl and put the delinquents on their parole of honor, or under the discipline of immediate law and order. And there was waggish little Hyde Cornelius Warrens, who will never be forgotten-who laughed out of love for it, and cried if his laugh was not appreciated; who could play the piano as fast as he could run, and could run a race with an English hare; who could sing like a young nightingale, and talk with a water-wheel. How often did the little fellow cling to the hand of Castlereagh in the dark, as they returned from the post office, from an evening lecture, or prayer-meeting, and shrink from the barking dogs. There was in him every thing affectionate and loving, but, alas! under temptation, he fell into a love of tobacco. All the efforts of Castlereagh were powerless to repress that vicious appetite in him, the boy, the little loving Hyde! But he loved him still; and while he studied at the Institute, no one was oftener indulged in his innocent wishes than he-no one oftener delivered out of the paw of larger lions in the school. 
               These were the boys and girls in the family and school of Castlereagh at this time; many had left it, others were coming in or applying for admission; and there were besides, the day-scholars, a large number. Often, almost daily, there would arise some temporary embarrassment to the regular motion of all the wheels of the instrument; but Castlereagh, by the exercise of decision, kindness, forbearance, and due penetration, although many times severely tried, could again cause thing to revolve and progress as usual. One day, observing that Harry Otis and Hyde Cornelius were disposed to torment one another, or were indisposed to be forbearing, he reproved them. By and by, as he happened to look from his room-window, he saw the former in hot chase of the latter; and presently a scuffle, a clinch, a roll over, blows; a boy's fight indeed! By this time he had them both on their feet, held apart firmly at his arms' length; shame and rage in their ruffled features, showing the badness of their deed, and proving how far their unrenewed hearts could lead them astray in paths of sin,

                  What means all this strife, my boys? Speak to me. 
                
                
                  Hyde. 
                  I have not injured him. 
                
                
                  H. O. 
                  He has; he's insulted me. 
                
                
                  Hyde. 
                  No, sir; I was only at play. 
                
                
                  H. O. 
                  Pretty play truly! call my father names! 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Be calm boys. The truth! 
                
                
                  Hyde. 
                  He has hectored me all day; and just now threw my cap over the roof of the kitchen, where it lodged behind the chimney. 
                
                
                  H. O. 
                  I did nothing to him at all, till he spouted water on me from his window with his mouth. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Oh! fie, fie, Hyde! 
                
                
                  Hyde. 
                  Well, sir, I did n't him, but he did me yesterday in the same way. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Can this be true, Harry? 
                
                
                  H. O. 
                  He called my father names-"Old General Alexander's son." "Ain't your father a great man?" and so forth. I'll not be insulted by Hyde Warrens any how. 
                
               Hyde had his ears pulled, and cried. Harry Otis was unsubdued. Castlereagh took him to his room; there he was unhumbled; he even threatened to leave the school if he was corrected. Castlereagh talked and reasoned with him; he remained the same. He was left in his room alone for the afternoon. By and by the window was elevated, and he sat down by it to hold conversation with the boys outside, and to while away the time. Castlereagh, seeing this, sent the boys all away and directed him to close his window, and also the blind; and to have no conversation with any person excepting with himself, until tea. Three years Harry Otis resided with him, and this was the only occasion Castlereagh had to use the rod in order to quell his pride. Before dark, the heart of the lad broke into a thousand pieces, and peace came again, though it was midnight are the excited nerves of Castlereagh allowed him his usual rest. Two years afterward, when they parted they wept together being locked in each others' arms, scarcely able, on account of great emotions, to utter the sad farewell. 
               Again, on the fourth of July, Hyde and another boy had wandered off so fat that they did not reach home until after dark. No one knew where they were. But a report circulated near nightfall that caused Castlereagh great excitement and apprehension, to allay which he was about to ride off to make personal inquiries, when the missing boys came in. The report was, that a lad had fallen that day, in consequence of making a mis-step, from the brow of a steep and perpendicular bluff, three miles off, a distance of one hundred and fifty feet, and been saved from death only as by a miracle, being sadly bruised and broken. In this manner was the mind of Castlereagh often disturbed; and his care and anxiety increased as the number of his pupils continually augmented, each developing a different shade of character, and each requiring his unceasing oversight. 
               These were trying times for sermons, and parochial visits. Often the bright Orient, sparkling and gorgeous with the uprising sun-beams met poor Castlereagh's almost blood-shot eyes as he cast himself on his couch on the morning of the blessed Holy Sabbath, appointed unto man for rest, to gain a brief repose ere the joyous bells of the Sanctuary should summon their worshipers together, and call the pastor to his public ministrations! Oh! heedless Castlereagh, thus wickedly trifling with the boon of health. Thus recklessly pursuing a way so eminently absurd! Who of all thy prominent, and pious, and intelligent people, would have thanked thee to lay out thus for them a Sabbath's intellectual feast? Who of them that would not have reproved thee for the expensive condiments of the banquet if the cost thereof could by any means have been known to them? And what cared they, the young and cheerful and giddy ones who on their heads and arms wore all the religion they possessed, or seemed to want, for the long night-watching's over the inspired page where prophet and holy man wrote of 
                      
                   who in the beginning created the heavens and the earth and taught of Jesus, who Egr;  ? (in the beginning was the Word). Yet truly to do them service, thou didst these things-overdoing thyself, and faultily overdoing. But-ah! there is the "BUT" of all our life's sad reprehensions, and it hath a recuperative energy in us, over us; thou mayest have done good thus, beyond all ordinary, straightforward, well-directed, long and easy-lived methods of thy ministry that were open before thee. Sermons well-digested, well-conned, well and evenly penned, in fair round hand, yea, well-studied, half-committed, all wrought and perfect, done, all done and laid aside by Friday evening, might not have served thee as well as they have, doubtless, served others. It may be, thou hast saved a soul, by watchings of the long night, therefore, till the morning hour of Sabbath. 
                      
                        Yet Nature hath her day and power; 
                        'T were well to know these things. 
                        Nor risk the backward tides 
                        That bear upon, and rend life's firmest strings. 
                     
                  
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XI. 
               THE TABLEAU. 
                
                  Harry Otis. 
                  I have called, sir, to ask of you a favor to us boys. 
                
                
                  Castlereagh. 
                  Very well, Otis; let us hear it. 
                
                
                  H. Oits. 
                  You know, sir, that we like a little fun now and then, and it is a long time since we have had one of out tableaux and caricature theatricals in the hall. We did not know but you would give us your consent to have one. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Such exhibitions, Otis, are not very elevating, certainly, unless they are very properly "got up;" and they are apt to dissipate your minds to the loss of study and valuable time. I can, however, give you an evening if it is best. 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  Thank you, sir; the boys seem rather anxious. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  "The boys," Otis, which of them seem to be the most so? 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  True, sir, I-I stand corrected. I am as anxious as either of them. But candidly we boys in the house want a little money for the fourth of July, and propose to give the entertainment at two cents each admission ticket to the whole school and family. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Are there any gift tickets? 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  We have already agreed to give them to yourself and Mrs. Castlereagh. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  And I conclude you will expect us, because these entertainments are sometimes rendered of doubtful propriety unless there is a clergyman and his wife present to give them a good type of character! You remember, Otis, the "Great Juggler," so called, who was in town last autumn? 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  Yes, sir. Very well. Ha, ha! 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  He sent me a family ticket, with his card and best regards, and expressed the hope that I would favor him with my presence. Oh! Harry, I could but say with myself, here is this man, professedly a deceiver, proud of his public character as a juggler, and as much in earnest to carry his point and obtain the undivided attention of the community as he could be were he fired with pious zeal for their salvation. He asks me, my wife, and children, he gives us tickets, he urges us to attend, and all this for no possible good to me, or them, or others. While I am endeavoring to lead men to church and religion, he is urging us to forget and deny Christ. He is zealous in a work that is directly the opposite of mine, and yet unblushingly sends me his card, and urges me to patronize him. He even calculates on my being present to assure the people that the exhibition is morally harmless, and even beneficial. These were some of my thoughts then. But I do not, of course, by these words, intend a rebuke to you, lads, because I suppose your play is really but an innocent diversion. 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  Such is its only design, sir; and yet I fear that we may sometimes go too far in our diversions. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  It is quite supposable. May you be directed ever, my dear boy, in the true and safe path to eternal life. I understand very well the object you have in view. What evening do you desire? 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  If we can have the hall, we should be glad of Thursday evening. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Very well; you have my permission. 
                
                
                  H. Otis. 
                  Thank you, sir. The boys will feel-that is, we, boys, will be extremely obliged to you. (Exit.) 
                
               These little exhibitions and while-aways were allowed the boys usually about twice each term. They were intended for the amusement of the scholars and of the family. Frequently they came off with bursts of happy feeling, though sometimes the actors failed to satisfy themselves, if not their auditory. When Thursday evening arrived, and the hour had been announced, there was an immediate rush for the hall, tickets being loudly called for, and pennies fast accumulating. All the lamps in the hall were lighted. A curtain stretched across it in front of the platform, before which seats were advantageously arranged, sufficient to accommodate all who might attend. With noiseless steps the actors behind the scene prepared their exhibition; and a young page, in a white jacket, distributed through the audience the evening's programme. The youthful assemblage of boys and girls, dressed in their neatest garments, all rose and saluted Castlereagh as he, with the ladies and gentlemen of the house, arrayed in rich, and some of them in fantastic, and others in Oriental robes, entered the hall, and took their seats. All seemed delighted; expectation was fairly on tip-toe; the feet of the younger boys, especially the heels of their shoes, testified to their impatience, when, lo! the Seminary bell strikes one. A lively, silvery tinkling bell behind the curtain answers it, and the curtain slowly rises. Hardly a breathing disturbs the silence that now prevails. On an elevated pedestal, leaning on an illuminated canvas, encircled with evergreens, appears the form of Washington; a page, in white, with flowing locks, kneels before the statue, with both hands extended toward it, and at the same instant, a low and solemn dirge is heard from without, and chantings, sayings- 
                      
                        "Great, great, great and immortal Washington, 
                        Too soon hast thou ascended to glory." 
                        O'er the story the gory nations joy; 
                        And hope is strong, 
                        For Freedom's glory dawn, 
                        Though chains do gird, and tyrants yet destroy. 
                     
                  
                
               Slowly, to the movement of the chant in the last line, a curtain dropped over the tableau; and, as the audience recovered from its spell-bound state, a young orator stepped forward near to the edge of the platform, and delivered a magniloquent oration in praise of the arts and sciences, the progress of ideas, the munificence, generosity, and discriminating patronage of the age by which the superior talent of "the young and rising generation" was developed, which conferred on it immortal honor, and especially adorned the brows of the savans of Lindenvale Institute, with garlands of perpetual green. No sooner were these words pronounced than three or four young lads rushed from behind a screen, each with wreaths on his arm, and, before their object was well understood, they had crowned Castlereagh and all the teachers, and as quickly vanished. At this pleasing and unexpected episode a general shout of mirth broke forth from all present, and a great clapping of hands, amid which the curtain fell. Miss Merrick and Racey, who sat near each other, seemed particularly to enjoy this event; Castlereagh laughed outright, and Monsieur La Place called it "le grand garland surpise des petits garcons." 
               Sarah Matilda could hardly preserve her wreath from the enthusiastic grapplings of both Johnnie and Hobbie. After a time, the little signal-bell again quieted the disturbed state of the audience, and, the curtain rising, there appeared Harry Otis sitting at the hall-piano, and the others of the actors all near by, coversing earnestly together in a low tone of voice, or in whispers. They were finding the puzzle for Magic-music music, one of their number, to whom it was unknown, being without. This was often parlor play of the family at Castlereagh's, and always awakened considerable interest. It consists in finding something for one of the number to do, who knows nothing of it and is out of the room, but which is known to all the rest. When the outsider is introduced, he is guided to it by the pianist, who plays low, lower, lowest, or loud, louder, loudest, as the finder is near to, or distant from, almost discovers it, or is very blind, quite makes out the mystery, or is in a complete fog. Nothing is said by any one, but universal interest is depicted on every face, and gentle clappings, and nods, and blinks, and "pshaws!" and "indeeds!" and "oh, dears!" in supressed voices or whispers; shrugs and groans, and "almosts" are seen and heard over the whole room, as the party watches the progress of the game. 
               Our young actors having agreed among themselves as to the puzzle, scattered themselves about the stage, some of them sitting down and others standing. Hayden was the finder. It was always difficult to puzzle him, and the audience, as much in the dark as himself as to the object to be discovered, wondered what in the world it could be. They closely followed his movements, here and there, noticed every change in the music, were excited or depressed, encouraged and confident now, anon baffled and hopeless. Harry Otis played it out very intelligibly and encouragingly, but Hayden was a long time baffled, and every body began to give him up. 
               The young boys and girls "would give up any how." The older and more persevering "hoped he would find it first." At length Hayden seized a table and carried it to the center of the stage. The piano grew loud, swift, loud, louder. as he spread upon it a cloth. Hands began to clap all round, eyes to sparkle, excitement to increase. "Dishes, plates for supper," cried Hayden, as if to his servants. They were brought. Loud and swift went the music. "Bread!" (music faint). "What, no bread?" murmured he. "Sweetmeats!" (music dull.) "Nor sweetmeats?" "Oh! stewed oysters" (music almost unheard). "What neither bread, butter, cakes, sweetmeats, oysters-fat poultry?" (music inaudible). "Nothing to eat at this magnificent table?" mumbled he. The music seemed to answer "even so," for it rolled away quite briskly. "A table, plates, no food," soliloquized Hayden. "The company will please follow my example, and sit down," said he. But the music faded. "No company, then!" And he was quite thrown off. "Might as well have no light." At the word "light" the music rallied, "Ah! well, a dark meal, here goes," and as he was about to extinguish a lamp, the only one on the table, the music dropped away again. A sudden thought relieved him. He sat down the light, the music rejoiced again. "Well," said he, "you shall have light then." The music broke forth into a gay 
                  feu de joie. Seizing all the lamps that were burning near him, and placing them together on the table, as the music gave its loud, louder, loudest tones of victory, and actors and spectators rose, and cheered, and clapped, Hayden came forward, and exclaimed, "Ladies and gentlemen, will you please to approach, and partake of a LIGHT supper!" And so the curtain again was allowed to drop. Then followed the tableau of the Wounded Hussar, sustained finely by Amos. To this succeeded the scene of the District School. The Editor's Soliloquy followed, it ran thus: "I have composed a great many articles and leaders," says the editor. "but none equal to this. How will it read and look? Yet, it is true, when I wrote this article, I didn't believe it true. I wrote it to fill up, and versus Moggs of the other paper. But the more I look at it, the more I read it, the more ground it seems to cover-the more truth-like it appears-the better it reads and tells. Fact is, Moggs can't answer it. The piece is altogether too smart for him, and more truth in it than he usually dabbles in. I like the articles. People will read that. There is sconce in it. It is theoretically true, and practically unanswerable. I am about sorry that I did not put my name to it square in and out. It can't alter the thing, though. There it is in black and white, and true or false, it must add to our fame. False, did I say. It was only false in the first idea, viz.: that we need no tariff. If I established that point, then where was the original evil? It is nowhere where-it is gone-annihilated. Have I not annihilated the argument in favor of tariff? Do we need any taxation to make us happy or more contented? 'Yes,' says Moggs, of the other paper, 'where is the revenue of the government coming from if not from a tariff of duties? We may,' says he, 'tax ourselves on tea, silks, coffee, and all imported articles a few cents a pound, or yard, or measure, and shall not feel it.' But I have shown that direct taxation, when we want the money, is the thing for us. Moggs, the Know Nothing, must now give in. True, my leader was in original idea defective, but the conclusive reasoning settles the thing. I'm satisfied Moggs is down, beaten, routed, driven off the field, completely put hors du combat, a used-up man. The article is compact, invulnerable, weighty, convincing-it has convinced myself. I'm a convert to myself-a regular me in my. I have heard of a man who was opposed to rail roads, but being appointed to write the article for discussion in favor of them though sorely unwilling, he complied, and converted himself. I belong to his school, and predict for myself hereafter a splendid career of popular favor. Moggs, the Know Nothing, is a doomed man. Farewell to Moggs and all his greatness." 
               "A very good hit, sir," said Gustavus to Castlereagh, as the curtain fell. 
               "Capital!" he replied; "shown up principle." 
               "Petits garcons," said Monsieur La Place. "No fools-very." 
                
               "Ha! ha! good, for Mr. La Place," said the ladies. 
               The sound of martial music behind the curtain, and afar of, was now heard; the signal bell rings once again; and, presently, as the music came nearer, lo! a company of Continentals, marching, with shouldered muskets and knapsacks, to the stirring sounds of fife and drum-Hyde the fifer, Stanton the drummer. The earnest, solemn tread, the firm way they had, their marching and counter marching, in platoons, in single file, in solid column, in echelon, by right wheeling into line, by left backward wheel, forming hollow square, and breaking up into column, dressing by companies, or battalions, shouldering arms, ordering arms, presenting arms, carrying arms, sloping arms, trailing arms, resting arms, loading arms, ramming down cartridge, priming, making ready to fire, aiming, firing, recovering-all these were admirable performances. The old Continentals themselves couldn't have done better; and to the ripe old music of Yankee Doodle, the curtain fell, as the band, amid the cheers of the audience, marched to their barracks. 
               "Ladies and gentleman," said a young lieutenant of the army "we are greatly sensible of the honor and pleasure given us by your presence this evening, and beg leave to return you all our sincere regards. Ladies and gentlemen, the exercises of the evening are closed."

               "Very well, my boy; what does scholasticus qualify?" inquired Racey of a black-eyed little pupil who had declined the word. 
               "I don't exactly know, sir." 
               "Don't know, Peleg!" 
               "Well, sir, suppose it qualifies drift.
                
               "Qualifies what, 'drift?'" 
               "Yes, sir, drift, or 'drive.'" 
               "Well, now, supposing that it qualifies 'drive,' what does drive mean?" 
               "It means to drive up scholars, sir." 
               "Very well, Peleg (the boys finding Racey in good humor, look up and laugh), suppose it qualifies 'drift,' what does drift mean?" 
               "It may mean wood or snow." (The boys continue to enjoy it.) 
               "Then you render it-?" 
               "Scholars are drift-wood." 
               "Ha! ha! ha! very good. What is 'driftwood?'" 
               "It is wood of various sorts, that the swollen streams float down and scatter high and dry on the bank, and shows, in part, the fragments of what were once useful, though rather dangerously-located edifices." 
                
               "Why, Peleg, where now did you get this curious notion, and where does it apply?" 
               "It applies, sir, to authors." 
               "Ah! ha! They are drift-wood, our pupils, and students in academies and colleges; our great and learned men in all professions, especially our fine writers and authors, eh?-floating most numerously when the tides are high, but left forlorn and desolate on the shores of life when the stream on which they carelessly floated-the stream of public favor-subsides into its customary channel. And 'snow' is what?" 
               "Drift-snow' is that which forms into banks of snow where-" 
               "Where, what?" 
               "Scholars are stuck, sir!" (Great and prolonged sensation among the boys, while Gustavus walks the room, and applies his handkerchief to his eyes.) At length, order being restored, says he- 
               "Very well, young scholasticus, I hope you will, if stuck in a snow-bank in the winter, thaw out, and drift away on the high tides of the spring streams." 
               So young, hopeful Peleg, the wittiest wag of the school, and a fair scholar, went to his seat. 
               "I think," said Gustavus, aside "that Castlereagh must have shown the boy the title, and some of the unreadable and dull paragraphs of his forthcoming SCHOLASTIC DRIFT, i. e. DREAMS AND REALITIES, otherwise I can't form the first idea of the manner in which he possessed himself of this pun." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XII. 
               MISS MERRICK-GUSTAVUS-THE NEXT TUTOR. 
               THUS the summer term of 185-passed along. Many were the days when Miss Merrick suffered from severe indisposition, and was scarcely able to perform her duties in the school. Yet she was ever uncomplaining, sweet, affable, tender, affectionate. Rosetta grew intensely anxious for her, and sought, by little attentions that lay in her power, to relieve her labors. But these seasons of distress would again wear away, and she would be found again attending to her duties. Gustavus begged that she would give him the whole charge of her department for two weeks, while she returned home to recruit. This she declined, and said, "I shall soon be better." 
               "Dear sir," said Gustavus to Castlereagh; "can there not be some thing done to relieve Miss Merrick? she is very unwell." 
               "I have urged her to take a vacation, and my wife has offered to do all her work in her absence, but she thinks our fears are groundless;" he replied. 
               "I hope they may prove so," said Gustavus; "but I greatly fear that she is losing strength. Do you observe that she moves often with pain, and that she is very pale?" 
               "Yes, I have observed it all. Last evening, at the prayer meeting, she was faint. But you know she will do all that lies in her power." 
               "True, she is unsparing in her exertions, unselfish in her wishes, and lovely in every thing. She has, beyond measure, the love and confidence of her pupils, and it would be a great misfortune to lose her assistance." 
               On that day Sarah Matilda had a long and interesting talk with her; but she resolutely affirmed that she was not ill, her only difficulty being a slight rheumatic spasm. She continued to attend to every duty whenever in her power. There were days when she could not. 
               "Never," said Castlereagh; "was there a more faithful, pious, and devoted young lady. I have never seen one glaring nor hardly a discernible fault in her. How sweetly and calmly she sits down in the slip at church, and attends to the worship of God. How reverential of goodness; how confiding in the truth; how hopeful in Christ, and yet how self-distrustful is she. And those young pupils that she has the care of in the Sunday-school, they seem almost to worship her." 
               With the college commencement, in July, came to a close the summer term of the Institute. As usual, on Saturday previous to the examination, which began on Monday and terminated Tuesday, the school-rooms of the seminary were hung with evergreens and flowers. Oh! what a delightful picture does a happy roomful of bright, intelligent lads and girls present on such an occasion. One wishes he were young again-one of them-a happy pupil among these joyous faces. They come together all dressed in their best robes, and wearing smiles on their checks. They show, in their countenances, and in their manners and general deportment, their improvement. Happy are their parents who see in them now the reward of their care and expense. Happy are their teachers who can say of them "they have finished their arithmetic, had done well in algebra and Euclid, in grammar, history, and geography, etc., etc., and have merited our approbation for correct behavior." 
               A large collection of persons assembled in the afternoon of Tuesday, to hear the compositions and declamations, and, on leaving, expressed themselves most highly gratified. Castlereagh was in a high state of excitement, and overjoyed that all went off well; at the same time it was evident that he was himself in need of relaxation. There was a nervousness about his actions, a paleness of the brow, and a sinking of the cheek unnatural to him. He determined to take a journey to the North, as soon as well released from the term. 
               "Well, Fitz Maurice, what's to be done this long vacation?" 
                
               "I think, sir, if you are willing, of spending a few days with my cousins, in A--, and then of making a pedestrian excursion to the romantic regions of Berkshire, visiting William's college, climbing Greylock, and in that mineral region, adding all in my power to my stock of ores and minerals generally." 
               "Very good;-and who will accompany you?" 
               "Hayden talks of it, sir." 
               "Well, go. You will be absent how long, do you think?" 
               "Not over three weeks in all." 
               "Very well; after that you will spend a little time here to brush up anew, and render assistance to the family, eh?" 
               "Oh, to be sure, most gladly." 
               "Good-by, then, as you are now bound for the city." 
               "Harry Otis!" 
               "Sir!" 
               "Good-by, my boy; take good care of yourself. Give my respects to your father.-Here's the letter to him I spoke of." 
               Harry Otis was in the midst of a group of girls and boys belonging to the family, all separating for a long vacation, and all bidding adieu with tears and smiles. 
               "Amos!" 
               "Here, sir." 
               "A fair vacation to you." 
               "Thank you, sir." 
               "Don't forget to give my letter to your father." 
                
               "Not at all, sir." 
               "Good-by, Moniseur La Place, and much joy and happiness to you." 
               "Ah! mon cher Monsieur Castlereagh; tanks, tanks, a tousand times. Oui, oui, avez soin de Vous. Adieu!" 
               "Racey, my good sir; this is hard to part with you. I am sorry neither yourself nor Miss Merrick will return. By the way, see her safely and carefully on the cars; look out for the boys also; will you-can you?" 
               "Oh, yes; to be sure, sir, I will see to all, and will write you by and by." 
               "Here, my dear Rosette, have n't you spared one kiss for me? Thank you. Adieu, Miss Merrick; heaven bless and preserve you." 
               "We shall meet again, my dear sir." 
               "Yes, yes, yes," he answered, with a faltering voice. "We shall meet where all will know as they are known, and see as they are seen, and every thing be made right forever." 
               "Amen," said she; and leaning on the arm of Sarah Matilda, she walked to the omnibus in waiting. Castlereagh never saw her again; but he often gazes, with affectionate remembrances of her, upon the admirable daguerreotype that she left with his wife. "Good-by, Hyde, Stratton, Isabel, Roxenna! good-by, farewell, adieu, all;" and ALL reciprocate, "good-by, farewell, adieu." 
               "Adieu, au revoir!" shouted monsieur, waving his chapeau from the open coach. 
                
               Baggage, passengers-all aboard; some on the outside, and some within-a huge load; away they drive, and white handkerchiefs are long seen waving, and hats and caps, also, by each party, till distance separates them. Hayden, Stella, Clarissa, and others, are soon called for by friends in private vehicles, and reach their homes by a drive over the hills. 
               It was Friday morning, after the commencement, when Castlereagh called at the room of a student in college, who, the day previous, had graduated with high honor in his class, and was about to go forth into the world to seek its fortunes. He was about the middling size, rather stoutly built, with sandy hair, large lips and eyes, with heavy eyebrows and lashes; his countenance denoted decision and kindness; he was without whiskers, without curls in his well-combed locks, without fashion, and without impropriety in his fashion. He wore a clean dickey, which always gives a neat expression to a gentleman, even if otherwise more or less shabby-and a white cravat. His coat was a fine pea-green, and pants, London brown. He sat on a box in which he had been packing his books and movables, and driven the last nail. 
               "I told you yesterday, Mr. Marshall," said Castlereagh, "that I should call to-day to learn your decision." 
               "Yes, sir. I have expected you." 
               "Do you feel at liberty to accept of my proposals?" 
                
               "Well, I have thought favorably of them, and have concluded to teach your school for the next year." 
               "Ah! you have? I am very happy, sir, to have met you. I trust we shall form an interesting acquaintance in the course of the year." 
               "I trust so myself, sir. I have now got through college; my education has cost me time and money. I am disposed to take hold of your school for this, among other reasons, viz., that I may see if my education is practically worth any thing to me." 
               "A very good ambition, it strikes me, although on the main question, I think there can be but little doubt, even without the trial you propose." 
               "Don't know about that," said he, quickly, rising, blushing, shaking his head and sides with an earnest, happy sort of laugh. (This was one of his great expressions on occasions of disputes, arguments, jokes, etc., etc., as Castlereagh afterward observed.) 
               "Well, I am quite happy in your decision. As I told you yesterday, President W. and Professor T. spoke to me of you in the kindest manner; and when your vacation expires, I will hope to see you." 
               "Yes, sir." 
               "And do you journey this vacation?" 
               "I am going immediately to my home from college, and in a few days to Niagara and Canada. A man wants to see Niagara once. I have a love of great cascades and whirlpools of water, of water itself, of the ocean. I am a strong swimmer, and love to bathe, swim, dive, breast the waves of the sea, as I have done on the beach of my native town, washed by the waves of Long Island Sound. And I have even helped my brother erect strong breakwaters against the encroachments of the Sound, under a contract with the government. You shall hear me tell of it some day." 
               "I shall listen to it with great interest, I presume, for I already a deeply attentive hearer." 
               "Pray, excuse me, sir," said he, blushing very deeply. "Consider that I am but just graduated, perfectly green, and unacquainted with the world; a simple-minded dem-de-"He would have said "democrat," but noticing a slight shade on the face of his listener, he hesitated, and gulping it down-for Castlereagh was a whig, he saw-he happily waved off the word by saying, "A simple-minded son of demonstrandi-do-dum." 
               "And I," said Castlereagh, recovering himself, and smiling gayly; "I also go for the 'scholasticus-a-um.'" 
               "We shall not disagree, sir, I see-saying nothing of politics." 
               "No, no-ha, ha, ha! I see the point-quite facetious you are. And so I may expect you?" 
               "I will be on the ground at the time." 
               "Then, good-morning to you. I have business that will occupy me for an hour. Good-morning." 
               "Good-morning." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               THE JOURNEY. 
               IT was a great relief to the mind of Castlereagh to secure his principal teacher for the ensuing year at so early a day, and now that he had the promise of a well-qualified and pious young gentleman to succeed him, he could the more easily reconcile himself to the withdrawal of Gustavus, who, burning with commendable desire to enter the gospel ministry, could not be induced longer to delay his professional studies. The parting with his two favorite teachers of the past year, Miss Merrick and Mr. Racey, saddened him, especially as the suffering one often seemed to flit before him, looking upward with a sweet and holy resignation, and so confirming his apprehensions that the parting between them was forever. How to fill her vacant position in the Institute, and reconcile to the change all parties interested, gave him some concern. He determined, however, to give himself no unnecessary anxiety on the subject, but to take it with him in his journey to the north, as a matter to be settled on the first opportunity. 
                
               He would have taken Johnnie with him, but the lad had been quite unwell and was feeble. Sarah Matilda on his account and Hobbie's, concluded to remain at home, and more especially as the summer family avalanche from the great metropolis had given out the customary tokens of its approach to fill the recently vacated premises. 
               "A good time may you have of it, Elbert," said his wife. "And may you come back with a great deal of resolution, and good health to undertake the duties of the fall." 
               "Rather a lonesome journey, I fear," said he, in a desponding tone; "I feel as one journeying to Paradise without Eve." 
               "Nonsense! nonsense, Castlereagh. Rather say you are journeying outside Paradise and have left Eve at home to take good care of it for your return." 
               "Capital, ha! ha!" cried little Johnnie from the lounge. 
               "Not a bad idea," said Castlereagh "if it was only in Milton." 
               "It is, every whit of it, as much as your journey in rail road cars to Vermont is!" 
               "And what's in Milton is n't all in the Bible," said Gertrude. 
               "Ain't?" inquired Johnnie, with his eyes open very wide. 
               "Why, no, Johnnie; not absolutely. Milton's poem is founded in Bible truth. But the author's imagination tion has filled it up with what sister Gertrude says is not all in the Bible." 
               "Oh, yes. But it tells about Adam and Eve and Paradise?" 
               "So far it is true, and much further. But never mind now, my lad. We will read it again by and by, and point out what may be termed the more imaginative portions of it. Johnnie?" 
               "What, sir?" 
               "Will you get over this sinking, feeble state, and so come up to Vermont with sister Gertrude by and by to see me?" 
               "I'll try to, father, I want to. The doctor says I may, for I am a good deal better." 
               "Oh, yes, you are, or I could not think of leaving you. Well, you shall go to see your uncle and aunt and your cousins at the north just as soon as your mother and the doctor deem it prudent." 
               "Very good, father; I shall get better every day." 
               On the following Monday, Castlereagh left home. 
               "Upon my word," said Mrs. Hayward, at home, in New York, "if Castlereagh has not written again a long letter to the paper. A great amount of relaxation he is taking, sure enough! I knew it would be so. I told Sarah Matilda to caution him and forbid it, and here we see with what effect." 
               "Still it is readable affair, mother," said her smiling daughter, Agnes, as she threw the paper on the table. 
               "I don't care a fig for the readableness of it. Every body knows a man can write well enough if he is disposed to, and is in the right circumstances-the question is, simply, whether Castlereagh ought to write just at present." 
               "Mother," said Blanche, "it isn't every one who could write out of such barren materials a letter-" 
               "So much the worse, Blanche; it is harder work for his mind, and that's what I am complaining of. Let him rest-" 
               "But he won't rest." 
               "Let him" (she was about to say "die, then," but checking herself, she said) "move on then, but not stop a whole day, or sit up a whole night to write letters. Here, Effie, take this paper to your father's office, and show what Castlereagh is about. Next week there will be another, and then others still, besides his regular communications to the monthly magazines, religious papers, and I know not all what. Give me my pen, Agnes; I will write to him myself." 
               So Mother Hayward scribbled. Ah! how extensive is the scholastic calamus. Men write, women write, boys and girls write, teachers and scholars write, authors write, traveler's write, editors write, printers write, print and sell, all men buy, read, re-write, and all go drifting, drifting, drifting on the same great tides of time. The world is full of books and writers. 
               It the mean time, the letter-writing of our good mother went on. But it failed to get off in season for the mail, and was put by for the next. In the evening paper there appeared another letter. Fearing there would be a third and a fourth before she could dispatch her rebuke, she sat up till midnight to add a long postscript, and saw it the next morning put into the hands of the post agent on the cars in the seven o'clock train. 
               Sat up till midnight, did she?-Yes. For what? To chide Castlereagh for doing the same thing. But Castlereagh was really enjoying a very fine interval of recreation. There is a pleasant farming town to the north of Springfield, lying south and east of the Holyoke ridge of hills, call it, for a name's sake, Courtland, where, for one hundred, or, perhaps, two hundred years, the good people have resided, cultivating their acres, and never quite "building a city." Sometimes they have agreed together, and worshiped under one roof. At other times they have quarreled, and held ceremonies under two roofs. They have sometimes had a common center, with a well-regulated circumference, and at other times an uncommon center, without any circumference, for when at peace and in fellowship, all Courtland, from its further outline, worshiped and traded at the center. At other times, all Courtland, from center to circumference, worshiped and traded where they could or would. 
               Here, also, Castlereagh had an uncle in time past, and although he was a farmer, a manufacturer, a merchant and postmaster, he was, beside these, and all with them, a good Christian man and a scholar! Venerated Dartmouth was his Alma Mater. He had gone now to his great home. No peaches, in his riper years, had Castlereagh e'er seen and eaten, like for flavor, size and excellence, to those that hung in such multitudinous forms of temptation from the boughs of his trees, or lay dissolving in their own sweetness on the green grass beneath them. Those days of boyhood and of peaches passed away, and with them passed at length the beloved and venerated AZOR, the son of Azor-"Azor," the- 
                      
                        Scholasticus -a -um! 
                        Nil desperandi -do -dum. 
                     
                  
                
               It were a long tale to relate, how he wandered, how he suffered, how he overcame, and, happily, in a distant place, sojourned; and how, in a sweet and densely-shaded cottage, erected in the center of one of the finest farms washed by the Susquehanna, at last he died. The boy-cousin, with whom Castlereagh in early life ate peaches, gathered grapes, raked hay, and stoned the old red school-house, was R. In his young manhood, blessed with affluence, he became the venerated father's prop, and purchased for him and the kind mother who bore him, their pleasant place, where it was sweet to live-a calm and beautiful spot, where one may not, in his old age, refuse to die. "I have never seen the righteous forsaken," cried out the Psalmist. Riches that a man hath gained, when thus employed, are in themselves forgotten in the generous quality of the action done by them. They redeem themselves from the evil natural to them, and incite in one a wholesome appetite therefor. Employed aright, they confer great honor on him who has them, and redeem his name from corrupting selfishness. Appleton! Williston! Lawrence! Tappan! Cooper! Bartlett! Astor!-et omne genus. Munificent benefactors! and men of lesser thousands, lesser note, and little known-ye who have with your kind help, in ten thousands of instances, relieved the poor, encouraged the young, and smoothed the rugged pathway of the aged, great and magnificent host, we give you praise! Hereafter, ye that have done good for Christ's own sake, will hear Him say, "Well done, ye blessed of my Father, enter ye into the joy of your Lord." 
               Fifty years after he graduated, AZOR visited Dartmouth. It was but two or three years ago-and now he sleeps. And there, too, sleeps the beautiful ELLEN! The Susquehanna, flowing near their graves, gives to them an eternal green. Born in this same old town of Courtland, little Ellen grew a bright-eyed, graceful, pretty girl, near the waterfalls and vines, where in busy life her parents toiled, "she dancing on the sunny side" of the hill-sheltered cottage; and then, when they removed, she went with them to bloom around their new home, where, for a few years, she would sing, and smile, and cheer them, and love, and learn. Bright mark for death's own archery-"The idol first." She is wounded-dies! But her sweetest song is the swan-song of her exit. Her spirit longs to be free. Her grave is near the murmuring waters of the Susquehanna. 
               Much time had passed away since, in boyhood's sports, Castlereagh had visited Courtland. He now returns there to find that nearly all have fled whom he once knew so intimately. Still there is one family well-remembered and beloved. Hardly has he reached the gate of the large old mansion than he is met by a cheerful group, with wide open-mouthed greetings of welcome, and the weary day is forgotten. 
               There is no blight where there are kind, lovely, and intelligent friends. Such were the uncles and cousins Burkley, whom Castlereagh now visited. Henrietta the elder, and Abbie the younger, were only daughters of idolizing parents, sisters of brothers who would willingly die for them. Henrietta was tall, graceful, brilliant; Abbie, delicate, retiring, winning. You knew not why, but they stole into your heart. Bright, shining, kindly eyes, graceful in all their movements, unreserved in their conversation, sensible, witty, unaffected, chatty, cousins indeed; you admired them, and felt an acquaintance of years in a few brief moments, and wondered where you and they had been all this long while of years. And the sun went toward earth's horizon-lines as they all chatted together, the mother and father, and brothers and sisters, and Castlereagh. 
               "And have you heard of my brother, in the Islands?" inquired the mother. 
                
               Castlereagh sought to look, and to answer calmly; but the question came abruptly, and his manner was constrained and embarrassed. 
               "Why! what can be the matter?" quickly said the anxious inquirer, with a look that drove forthwith all concealment from him, and left him at her mercy. 
               "Is my brother sick?" inquired Mrs. Burkley, in a calmer tone. 
               "Aunt Harriet," replied Castlereagh, "I must tell you, I see, all that I myself know of him. Just before I left home news came to town that he had been very sick-but that he was now no more sick, the Lord Jesus having removed him to where there is neither sickness, sorrow, nor death." 
               For a moment she moved not, she wept not, she spoke no word, but sat as though transfixed with the fatal, cold dart herself. At length, while all were mourning around her, she exclaimed, "Dead! Is he dead! William! My brother! my brother! oh, my brother!" 
               But he answered her not. The youngest of the father's house, and he afar off. The talented Scholasticus, the pious, the tall, vigorous, and noble one, was sleeping his last sleep. 
               "I will read you these extracts from the West India papers that I have with me," said Castlereagh, "then you can peruse these letters brought in by the vessel." 
               [From the Barbadian Globe, July 14, 185-] 
               "The grave has this day closed over the remains of a man who has for many years exhibited to this community an instructive example of a practical Christian, a sincere follower of the Saviour. 
               "The subject of this obituary, W. R. H--, Esq., expired yesterday morning at his residence, 'Sea View,' Hastings, to the great and inexpressible affliction of his beloved and affectionate wife, after a short illness. 
               "Our lamented friend died, we are informed, as he had lived, in faith and hope, in peace and charity. The blow has come upon his family and friends suddenly. In the vigor of his age, and in the midst of his usefulness, he has been struck down. A week ago, there was every prospect of a long and useful life; but the Almighty fiat went out that he should 'prepare to meet his God,' and we humbly hope and trust that this good Christian man was so prepared, and that he has gone to that rest which the people of God pant after, and are encouraged to expect when their painful mortal race shall be over. 
               "Mr. H--, a native of Vermont, U. S., has been many years carrying on a respectable mercantile concern in this city, under the firm of H-- and T--; and during his long residence in this his adopted country, he has gained universal esteem. He was a highly intellectual man, and eminently fitted to adorn society. Few strangers who have settled among us, have been so generally respected. His integrity as a merchant, his exemplary discharge of his domestic and social duties, his piety, his charity, all combined to raise him in public esteem, and will cause his death to be deeply regretted. 
               "By the death of Mr. H--, the situation of Consul for the United States becomes vacant. 
               "A striking proof of the estimation in which the deceased was held, has been evinced this morning, in the marked attention paid at the celebration of the funeral solemnities at St. Matthias's chapel. 
               "As soon as the intelligence reached Government House, the flag there was exhibited half-mast high; the example was immediately followed at Queen's House, the Commercial Hall, and other flag-staffs in the Island. His Excellency Governor Hamilton, accompanied by his Private Secretary; his Excellency the Lieutenant General, his personal staff; the Adjutant General and the staff; the Hon. Mr. Taylor, the Hon. and Reverend Mr. Gittens; the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney and Solicitor-General, and almost every other public functionary, and one of the largest and most respectable bodies of persons of all classes, were in attendance. A guard of honor, under the command of Colonel Brown of the 34th, and two regiments of the garrison were turned out, and lined the road through which the procession passed. The number of guns to which the deceased would, while living, have been entitled on any special occasion, were fired; and nothing, in fact, was wanting to demonstrate the deep feeling of sorrow which pervaded all classes, and the respect which was due to the country of which he was the worthy representative. 
               "The Lord Bishop received the procession at the door of the chapel, and read in the corpse; the Revs. C. C. Gill, A. Reece, and W. W. Jackson performed the other parts of the solemn service." 
               These were rites paid to a good man-a man who had gained for himself a CHRISTIAN character and its respect among a community of strangers. He was a man who, despite the hurry and care of business, rented a small room not far from his store, retired and appropriate, for the sole purpose of meditation and prayer. "Help, Lord! for the goodly man ceaseth from among men." Sincere mourners! weep on, speak on; recall the last fall's visit that he made you; remember well his love, his kind and cheerful words, and his last parting salutations. His tall and manly frame has been cast down, and ye see him no more. 
               A temporary gloom followed from the communication of the intelligence of which Castlereagh was made the unwilling bearer. By and by, the spirits of all revived again, and they spoke calmly and even cheerfully of the departed. Thy viewed him now as one gathered into the great Fold of the Redeemer, and resting forever from all his toils, and fears, and conflicts. 
               "Henrietta," said Castlereagh, on the following day, as they were walking together along the wayside, "we once, in a careless way, spoke to one another about your coming to live with us, and taking care of the young ladies' department in our school." 
               "Oh! yes, I remember it, and have often thought the situation would be profitable to me and pleasant." 
               "I do not wish to urge it against your mother's and sister's wishes, or your own plans, but really, as the place is now vacant, it would give me great pleasure indeed, and so it would Sarah Matilda, if you would come and fill it." 
               "Your teacher has then left you?" 
               "Yes, greatly to our regret. Her health seems to be too delicate for the work." 
               "Indeed! I am sorry to hear that of her-a very estimable young lady." 
               "Truly so-one of the most exemplary young persons I have ever known. But, she will not, I fear, tarry with us on earth long." 
               "Oh! how sad is the end of human life, when we see one who is so worthy, cut off in her usefulness and promise. How can we become reconciled to it?" 
               "Only, Henrietta, as we look trustfully upon the great map of providence, and see how one event combines with another to complete the wonderful designs of the Creator." 
               "True; 'it is not all of life to live, nor all of death to die.' We are here for the commencement of an immortal existence, preparing for our future state. If we are prepared, it can not be that we shall die too early. Still, we shall, I think, always mourn over the early dead, whom we loved, and who were useful and upright." 
               "Yes, but not mourn as they who are without hope." 
               "Very true; we shall not. Our sorrow will be a true, subjective one, a mourning of the spirit unseen by the stranger, by him unfelt." 
               "Such mourning leads one into the paths of godly sorrow, and into the obedience of Christ." 
               "Yes, these are His corrections felt in us that quicken our obedience and subdue our souls; so they seem to lead us where the will of God would have us walk." 
               "And if they have this effect, we can never be far from happiness-never in a state of suffering which shall preclude our hope of final salvation-never wholly useless on earth. The true Christian is sometimes off his guard, and affliction is sent on him as a kindly warning of his danger. It is also one of the great results of the first transgression of the race." 
               "It is remarkable that the same circumstance which convicts of sin, and proves us guilty, should also be the kindly voice of warning and a needful help of escape. So has the Creator filled the great chasms of nature with help, and admonition, and mercy. Woe be to him accordingly who striveth against his Maker." 
               "I admire your views on this subject. Let us study the Word of God for instruction, and how rich, and full, and permanent are the lessons which are conveyed to us. What truth there is in God, in nature, in Providence! There is no error-no falsehood. If we were to study the character of God, examining all His ways and acts, and His words spoken by Him for a thousand years, and then were to review what we had done, with all the light acquired by this investigation for another thousand years, and so on for millions of ages, we should never be able to detect one shade of error in Him, the least sin, or imperfection. Is not this a glorious conception of His being?" 
               "Truly magnificent; and as real as it is sublime." 
               "We can not exhaust His goodness, nor increase it. God is full, perfect, glorious in Himself." 
               "Yes, He is so; and I love to think that all our sorrows here are as the infinite goodness of God would have them." 
               So they pursued and finished their walk, and were met at the door of the family mansion by Abbie with a sweet smile and a pale brow. Castlereagh observed, he thought, that she was lame. Poor girl, art thou lame and afflicted! It were young for thee, so beautiful and lovely to be a sufferer. Perhaps it is not so to be. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               THE JOURNEY ENDS. 
               WANDERING from place to place, Castlereagh, on the Highlands of C--, found, at the going down of the the sun, one day, the grave of little JOSEPHINE. It was beneath the spreading branches of a tree in the public cemetery. One of the sweetest young hearts of New York city there reposed, having died in her grandmother's arms, and, ere she breathed her last, chosen her resting-place. "Let it be beneath the tree where the sweet little birds will come every day, and fold their wings, and sing to me as I sleep." And so they buried her there, and there the little birds sing above her as she sleeps. 
               After a few days, we find him far away among the Northern Highlands. 
               Here he received the following letters in two packages:

                           "I take my hands off from very pressing work to write you a few lines, and to express to you the great joy I feel in hearing from you. I have great reason of thankfulness that you are so good a correspondent, and never allow yourself to forget us at the parental home. We have good news from Sarah Matilda and the children. We shall all go there before, and return there after the wedding. Clifford seems overjoyed in anticipation of his approaching nuptials. Poor boy! May the blessing of health be given him as well as a wife. Has he not been a sufferer? I am very happy that you are able to write; but at the same time, I take the liberty kindly to suggest, that, in addition to your other writings, the articles that we notice with so much interest in the daily papers, must be altogether too great a tax on your strength. Will you consider this gentle hint, my dear son-in-law, as sent you out of the great basket of love we bear you, and refrain from over-taxing yourself when so favorably situated for relaxation and comfort. Need I express myself in stronger terms to you who know so well my custom and my opinions? I think not. I will trust you. In the mean time we are all well, and send you a variegated bouquet of compliments, salutations, and forget-me-nots.

                           "Your kind notes come daily to hand, and I perceive that as distant from us as you may be, we shall yet seem to be along with you. I did say, indeed, when you left, that you must leave us and your cares at home, but not in the sense of being forgotten, as I see there is no danger that we shall be. The children are daily readers of your epistles; and Johnnie, though too ill and feeble yet to run about, can walk the room, and take them from the desk. I am sorry to say that he does not seem to recover strength. Good Doctor --, who has been so attentive to him, advises me to send him to you, with sister Gertrude, and I shall do so, if he is thought strong enough for the journey. 
                           "You will receive a summons that will perhaps surprise you, and cause a temporary inconvenience in your plan of the journey. I refer to the approaching nuptials. Who should drive to our door the other evening, but Clifford and Olivia, in dashing style-the horse being the wildest, craziest thing that was ever fastened to a gig. They were en route to Boston, and stopped here over one train. They were in high spirits. Clifford sitting down at the piano, played and sung only one piece-the good old song by Russell- 
                                  
                                    "'On old Long Island's sea-girt shore 
                                    Many an hour I've whiled away.' 
                                 
                               This he performed so loud and wild that you would have thought him crazy, and Olivia closing her ears, entreated him to stop. They praised up the children, pulled their ears, praised up the supper, but ate little, and drove off. I shall hope for a line to-morrow. 
                           "P. S.-I am much pleased with your last plan for that grand house with verandas, yet I think that I have discovered faults.

               Castlereagh read his letters over twice, said his mother was angry at him for writing his "notes" for the papers, and he would not write another newspaper paragraph for a month. 
               The next day he packed up all his effects, and returned homeward. He arrived in season to join the nuptial tie for the youthful pair, who, with a thousand smiles and good wishes as their escort, soon commenced their distant bridal-tour. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XV. 
               MARSHALL-THE SEMINARY PATH. 
               A LONG summer vacation, and an agreeable ramble in the country had their perceptible influence on Castlereagh, who, returning a few days before the new term commenced, made every preparation in his power to begin it with clt. Fitz Maurice, though much disappointed at the advice of Castlereagh who proposed such a plan, concluded to study another year before entering college. He wandered around the premises a few days with a pale, discouraged look and an absent air, saying but little, and that generally in a discontented tone of voice. Castlereagh commiserated him, but had thought it best, on the whole, that he should go to college thoroughly prepared to enter on his studies. He knew that his course in college would be a successful one if well prepared to commence it, and to compete with his class-mates. Accordingly he allowed him time to think over his advice, and took but little apparent notice of his chagrin. It wore off by degrees, but he was not fully satisfied till deeply engaged in the studies of the term. 
                
               It was necessary that Castlereagh should spend time, exertion, and money over his school, in order to keep pace with the increasing luxuriousness and demands of the age. There were many other rival institutions about, and it would seem from the advertisements and editorial notices of schools, high schools, select schools, classical institutes, seminaries for boys, seminaries for girls, grammar schools, collegiate institutes, private family boarding-schools, self-supporting academies; the Barrytown, Hightown, Lowtown, Hulltown, Smalltown, Alltown, Scaretown, Dulltown high schools and graded seminaries; the Lombard school, Rev. Mr. Crane's school, Esquire Rush's private grammar school, the Messrs. Charles and Peter Grammerey's school, the Brothers Dawson school, Rev. H. Longacre's, D. D., school, the Misses Optimus's seminary, and Mrs. Smart's institute for old and young boys and girls-that all the world was schooling itself; a part, the great part, getting rich; a part, not a small part either, undertaking to learn. 
               It was necessary to procure new things every year. There must be the same attention to the old-fashioned studies of arithmetic, geography, grammar, spelling and writing; but these were only a part; in fact, they were not to be spoken about in company. If any body inquired "what branches are pursued at your seminary, sir?" the answer must be, "Geometry, conic sections, meteorology, esthetics, painting, music, German, Italian, Spanish, and modern history, communicated municated in twelve learned lectures, by Rev. Theophilus Melanethon, D. D., LL. D." An institution, numbering one hundred pupils, could not move without ten or fifteen highly accomplished graduates of college as teachers; and the school must be furnished with costly philosophical apparatus (seldom taken out of the cases!), extensive astronomical apparatus (often little understood, but making a fine glitter in the glass alcoves!), globes, maps, charts, cabinets zoological, mineralogical, geological chonchological (not frequently exhibited, studied, explained, comprehended, but highly useful to talk about in the newspapers, and to point at to parents and guardians' visitors). An extensive gymnasia also belongs to a modern school, large play-grounds, horses, carriages, servants, boats, guns, flags, drums, swords, tents, dancing-masters, and so forth and so on-price per annum, from three hundred to a thousand dollars per pupil. Somebody gets rich, somebody gets poor, somebody ought to know a good deal-Know-Nothings should be very scarce! 
               At Lindenvale, it was impossible, with Castlereagh's means, to do every thing on a scale so extensive and magnificent as this, and he was, of course, often obliged to part with some of his pupils who desired to keep up with the times. But he spent the whole of the income of the school, for the first two years, in adding to his apparatus and means of instruction, and the comfort of the pupils. And besides this, he found, at the commencement of the present term, that he was just one thousand dollars in arrears for these things and for family expenses. But no one, not even Sarah Matilda, observed that any serious weight was resting on his mind, as his spirit was sanguine and buoyant to a remarkable degree, and he was confident that the winter's terms would relieve him-so they did. 
               Every thing was pleasant, inviting, familiar-the sports healthful, the walks invigorating, the scenery attractive, connected with and around Lindenvale Institute. Castlereagh intended from the first, to make the school subserve the interests of sound learning and morals. So much hard study, so much order, so much amusement; and he sought to acquire the ascendant in the minds of his pupils by kindness, attention, and the reward of his confidence for correct deportment. A cheerful familiarity, never allowed to degenerate into rudeness, was always allowed in the family circle. He watched over his pupils with deep and constant solicitude, and rejoiced to see that, for the most part, their progress in education and in true politeness of manners, corresponded with his wishes. Still Castlereagh often sighed for means to enlarge his seminary more in accordance with many institutions, competitors with him for the public favor! So prone is man to feel the power of example.
                
               The time at length arrived for the return of the pupils and the commencement of the fall term. The morning bell of the seminary poured forth its loud and merry notes, and ere nine o'clock, the grounds were full of the boys and girls who came together here from various places, some, strangers entirely, others, old and very familiar faces. The boys who were acquainted ran and shook each other by the hand, and inquired how they had passed the vacation; the girls embraced and kissed each other, and exclaimed, "Oh! how glad I am that you have returned!" 
               All the morning Castlereagh was busy receiving calls from new scholars and their parents. His parlor was thronged with them. Introduction followed introduction, for besides himself, there was Sarah Matilda, Miss Henrietta Burkley, Mr. Worthington, Ide Marshall, and some others, teachers or assistants, all met to converse together for the first time, and to form some common plan of proceedings. As to the new pupils who called, as fast as possible every case was heard, and discussed, and decided. Then the party so relieved, gave way, and another came. On these occasions it was customary for every pupil to bring his books with him-consisting of seven or eight old volumes, already hard studied and still harder used, and most of them of a somewhat antiquated edition. These were hastily looked over and often rejected-"New books for new schools;" so others were recommended or enforced. By parents, generally, the pupil was said to be "very backward," and, "at first, would not do very well." Occasionally, one was said to be "wild," and would require "watching." (Smiles, "oh! dear's," nods, "not 
                  very's," "not much's," round the room.) Now and then one had finished all the chemistry branches, and would confine himself to languages; others to music and drawing. Inquiries from many common people, were about the price of tuition, and a little reduction was never mentioned to such but with evident satisfaction. Once in a while a boy came to the school with instructions from his father to study nothing but arithmetic, as the father never studied any thing else, and has got along well in life. These were among the annoying and whimsical things of the life that Castlereagh was pursuing. Yet he drew comfort from the thought, that in the end positive good would be made to appear. "What am I that I should be unwilling to meet trials of this nature, when I fully believe that one, only one of these children, who may be really benefited by my exertions, will, on earth and in eternity, be to me a measureless ocean of joy?" Thus Castlereagh philosophized and nerved himself to the work of doing good in his particular calling. He had made the discovery that it was indeed a vocation of earnest life. 
               After two days the Institute was arranged-a large school was classified as far as possible, and the lessons and regularities of the Seminary began to be enforced. Marshall displayed much coolness and judgment in his position as the principal teacher, although this was his first attempt at instructing a school. And no one ever took charge of the young ladies' department to whom the pupils became more fondly attached than to Miss Burkley. Eleanor. N-became an assistant in the school from the commencement of this term, and a boarder in the family. Clarissa did not return. Hyde and Stanton were away, also. But there were others in their places. About twelve boys and young misses were now received into the family, and Castlereagh found himself obliged to look daily after the comfort of a large household, and responsible for the instruction of about seventy-five pupils. There were incessant calls on him for family supplies, for books and stationery. An increase of pupils, attending to music, frequently made it necessary to purchase or rent another piano. New pupils, beyond a certain number, called for more furniture for their rooms, and new study-chairs and desks. New minds, with their own dispositions, tempers, wills, came to be developed, instructed, and governed aright. 
               Among a large number of pupils in such circumstances of daily association, there will often arise more or less ill-temper, and party lines will be formed, and clans modeled, and friendships and enmities run high. Castlereagh not unfrequently threw himself between his boy-combatants and sent one to his own room, another to his study, for disorderly behavior, and as frequently advised those who were too confiding and ardent in friendship to choose "the happy mean." But the feuds thus interrupted were not always quelled entirely by one interposition, nor were ardent friendships much less frequently contracted. Troubles would in a day or two break out afresh, and the heart of the Principal was often much grieved on account of these great sins. He prayed and labored to root out of the hearts of his pupils the pride which reigned in them, productive of these sinful ways, and although often generally successful in his government, he found occasionally one possessed of a willfulness and pride that cost him great troubles and sorrow. As pacificator of troubles, and umpire in cases where government was concerned, Castlereagh found something to do notwithstanding the customary freedom of his school from rebellious runaways and fractious ones. And this duty was the source of unfailing humiliation and tears. Nothing that ever came before his mind so thoroughly aroused in him feelings of anguish as that of juvenile impiety. When he witnessed the workings of pride, ambition, envy, jealousy, anger, malice, hypocrisy, revenge in the youthful heart, it smote him as with a rod of iron, and wounded him as an arrow sent to quiver in his life-blood. He could uniformly trace it to parental oversight, neglect, or indulgence. He could see that the child had not been taken in his early boyhood or very infancy, and faithfully, lovingly, and firmly educated and influenced. Nor had he been conversed with perhaps even once, as an accountable being! No! for he was deemed too young. Is the child too young at six years of age to know the difference between right and wrong, and to see himself as guilty in the sight of God? Is he also too young at the going down of the last sun of his eighth year, and he now standing near the circle of a new period of time, his ninth year? Too young when eight years old to be addressed earnestly on the subject of his sins, and his duty to God? Too young when ten years old! when eleven! twelve!! Alas! when then is he old enough; for long before they are even eight years of age do many children strive in their own little souls to resist temptation and find peace with God. So Johnnie told his mother one Sunday evening when she held with him a long, close, faithful, serious talk, and tried to teach him his great sinfulness, and positive need of God's help in order to a saving repentance of sin and a good hope of salvation. Castlereagh had not been six months at the head of this seminary before the perceived that the common sin of the parents of his pupils was the neglect of personal faithfulness in respect to their spiritual instruction. The children had not been, as a general thing, talked with and prayed with as if they were old enough to appreciate any such matter-when alas! they were already in the toils of Satan. Fellow-teacher of the young, knowest THOU not that these things are so? Verily I am persuaded already of thy answer-"YEA, YEA." 
               In the course of the first week, Marshall discovered clearly who were his good and trusty pupils, and who were bad or uncertain. He acccordingly went to Castlereagh with the names all drawn off in two lines, and proposed to re-seat the school on this basis. Castlereagh reagh sat down with him to read the paper, and was surprised at the conformity of their views respecting the character of the pupils. 
               "I agree with you for the most part," said he; "but I am amazed at your penetration in discovering so accurately the different habits and characteristics of the lads." 
               "Oh! it is simple," he replied. "Give a good, stringent lesson to a class, and you will soon see who know the whole of it, who know a part of it, and have a general idea of the whole, and who know little or nothing of it. Take all this latter class, and put them into work of another sort. Give them little to do, and watch them. By and by you will detect one asleep, another snapping his knife, a third pulling hair, a few making a little study. At the proper time call up the class for a recitation. The poorest ones know no more of this than they did of the previous lesson. A few show some mind and application. Put these into as high a class as you can consistently, and try them. The loafers begin with de novo, and keep them pretty near you. I knew in three days where they all stood; perhaps they will eventually some of them change places, but there they now are." 
               "It is true," replied Castlereagh. "We will make the arrangements you have proposed. If you have any trouble, speak to me." 
               "Thank you, sir. I think not of meeting with any opposition, and the movement will arrest some of their minds to reflection." 
                
               "It may. Please to see that Hogarth and Underhill, those two new boys who came yesterday into the family, are furnished with arithmetics and reading books; and be sure to have them attend faithfully to the seven o'clock study hour this evening." 
               "Yes, sir; I will not overlook them." 
               "I am willing all the boys should retire, if they choose, at eight o'clock. After nine I do not allow them to sit up, you know, unless there is some special occasion for it." 
               "True. They have shown but little opposition to the rule. And they rise generally with the first bell for prayers. This morning, Harry Otis, Hayden and underhill, with myself, rose before the bell, and climbed the rock of the bluff to see the sun rise." 
               "Ah! a rich and extensive prospect you had." 
               "Oh, yes; and it is by no means the first time, sir. I used repeatedly to walk here when in college, and climb to the same summit. I admire the sea view from this bluff. I have an extraordinary fondness for water scenes-and should rather die on the water than on the land." 
               "Have you notices, some time in your life, when you may have been there, perhaps, with a fine telescope in your hand, a distant range of hills laying far in the north, beyond the whole range that bounds the valley immediately lying in this basin?" 
               "I do not recollect to have seen the mountains you refer to, although, I suppose, they have been seen by others." 
               "I can not say that they have. But I was recently on mount Holyoke, eighty miles north of this, and could see far away in the south two elevations. One of them, the guide at the Mountain House there assured me, was the identical hill that rises immediately over our Seminary, visited by you this morning, and the other lies here, in the north-east, about three miles off." 
               "It may be so, sir. I have indeed heard that Professor-is of that opinion, and some others; but I have never been on Mount Holyoke. What do you think?" 
               "It is, perhaps, somewhat difficult to arrive at a conclusive opinion. The outline of the two peaks, as seen from Holyoke, is such as to remind one of these bluffs. But they seem to you, although you look on their rear, as they appear to an observer in front. I was struck with this circumstance instantly, and consider it an objection to the common opinion. Moreover, they are not remarkably high hills, and there are ridges and bold peaks further north in the same line of view, that may lay some claim to what is asserted of these. Yet I do not totally differ in opinion from others about them. The objection to other peaks, that they are too nigh Holyoke, it is difficult to refute." 
               Friday afternoon, just as the school was about to close, Castlereagh invited the boys to assemble next day at nine o'clock, and to accompany him to the foot of Bluff Rock, provided with shovels, axes, and hoes, in order to continue their labors on a new path they were making under his direction to the summit. This gave them great pleasure. The morning was very fair, the autumnal air bracing, and the occupation one that boys love. So when the hour arrives, Castlereagh numbered over twenty lads, who had come prepared for the sport. 
               "Well, boys, this looks well for our cause. Glad to see you. Now, will it not be best to choose our engineers, guides, pruners, and miners; and thus divide up the work, so that we may all labor to the best advantage?" 
               To this proposal all assented, and unanimously said that Castlereagh should be General Conductor of the enterprise, and Marshall should be Captain of the operatives. Harry Otis was chosen as the guide, Hayden chief sapper and miner, Fitz Maurice pruner, Edgar, Amos Sunderland and Lawrence Dwights, engineers. These arrangements being highly satisfactory, soon the word was given, and away they went, a merry, merry company, to complete the path to the mountain top, which Castlereagh had alone commenced, and which the boys had occasionally assisted him about. Arrived near the base of the huge perpendicular rock, they struck off under the direction of their guide, through the forest of young trees and bushes, winding around the perpendicular face of the rock to the western ern slope of it, where, amid jagged and fragmentary portions lying on a steep declivity, overgrown in part with cedars, shrub oak, and stunted pines, the engineers were to lay out the line of direction. At present they walked in a broad, well rutted, cart path. Presently the conductor says "Halt! The guide tells me that here we diverge from the path we are in, and strike immediately on to the hill. Pruner!" 
               "Here am I, sir!" answers Fitz Maurice. 
               "You must cut down the branches of this cedar that hang to the earth." 
               In a moment's time this was done, and the party saw a newly path leading them in a gentle curve around the base of a little hillock. They now arrived directly at the foot of the mountain, and rapidly began to ascend along its side by a curving narrow path, that had been easily made with a hoe in the crumbling, red sandstone. The guide led the way to a small tableland, with levers, hoes, shovels, and picks, to remove a large rock in the path. Having brought it up out of its bed, they rolled it to the brow, and sent it whirling into the valley with a great crash. 
               Then they all shouted, "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" 
               Underneath the perpendicular columns of the rock, and near all the steepest portions of it, there is an immense amount of fallen fragments that have been accumulating for ages, and have partially decomposed under the combined action of the sun and rain, as they have lain exposed there; and roots, and leaves, and earth, and moss, have enfolded and covered them. These must be passed over, and then you come to the base line of the solid mountain rock itself, and you begin to climb its age-worn sides. Castlereagh has partially laid out his path over this rubbish rock, and half-way up the hill; but he now submitted the whole to a review of the engineers. After carefully surveying the route, they decided to follow in the main, the direction which Castlereagh had already indicated by clippings from the bark of the trees that grew up here and there through the whole of this debris, diverging a little to the right in one place to avoid an immovable rock, and to the left in another to make the grade less. 
               And now all hands were put to work. It was impossible to remove the whole of the loose fragments; this would require the labor of many men and a great many days, for the rocks lay piled loosely one above the other from three feet to six feet deep. Accordingly they endeavored to level down the rough and uneven stones, fill up the open places, and wherever it was practicable, to make steps. Over wide chasms they placed long stone slabs side by side, and up steep places diverged a little to one side and then to the other, making narrower steps than where the way was more level. Lengthwise of this path, on both sides of it, they placed long heavy stones, which would answer the double purpose of protection and a guide. They worked very hard at this, choosing the largest loose pieces they could manage, and then with levers and with bare hands lifting and rolling until they perspired very freely and the excitement was very high. 
               When this most laborious part of the whole undertaking was over, the conductor called all hands to sit down and partake of some refreshments. The guide and engineers, together with the miner. having gone further up the mountain to lay out more work, were summoned down by the trumpeter, who blew the signal with his horn. You never saw happier faces, hardly ever redder ones, than all our young laborers wore at this moment. And they all chatted like so many birds in the air, and hopped about like squirrels on the trees. 
               The young commissary, with his assistants, having produced basket after basket of provisions, the contents were spread under the shade of the trees on the rocks, and glasses were filled from the water trickling down the ledges. A cold turkey was served on the occasion, two loaves of bread, and sandwiches, pies, cakes, beautiful, pippins, and pound sweets. Two large demijohns, filled to the cork with "milk from the brindled cow," were despoiled of their precious contents amid universal uproar, wit, sentiment, and song, the general conductor filling goblet after goblet as the thirsty young enthusiasts presented them. 
               the repast being nearly over, Marshall was called on for either a song or a story. Now, as for singing, he did not know one note from another, and a choice not being left him, he consented to tell a story, which was about himself; and as it was literally true, and particularly adapted to his auditory, some of whom were intending to pursue a college course of study, we will narrate it. 
               "When I was sixteen years of age," said he, "I had prepared myself to enter college. My father and mother were dead, and I resided with an elder brother. His house was situated near the shore of Long Island Sound, and not far off there was an extensive beach, where the sea in high gales and tempests washed away the banks and caused considerable damage. The government was obliged to defend it from time to time by a heavy break-water, i. e., a large thick stone wall laid in mortar, and at considerable expense. My brother had taken one contract of several thousand dollars, two or three years previous, and he now took another of sixteen thousand dollars. This was on his hands during the summer that I was sixteen and preparing to enter college in the fall. As he was willing to assist me, he offered me a share in the business, if I was disposed to take hold of the work with him, I consented to do so. We had fifteen or twenty men in our employ constantly, and it happened that my brother was taken ill-very ill indeed. He lay six weeks confined to his bed, and young as I was, the entire oversight of the work fell to me. Profiting by his advice, and encouraged by his confidence, for he could most of the time speak to me and understand the state of the work, I went forward, and did the heaviest part of the job before he recovered. When the break-water was completed, the men all paid off, and the bills were settled, my brother paid me for my profits of the work a thousand dollars, and with that I paid my way through college." 
               "Hurrah, hurrah! Good, good!" was ejaculated on all sides. 
               "We thought you were very expert in choosing and laying stones," said one. 
               "Yes," said another, "and we ought to profit by such a distinguished stone layer, en employe of the United States Government." 
               Marshall had become a lion. 
               "My lads," said Castlereagh, "this story of Mr. Marshall's, shows you that if you earnestly put your heads, hearts, and hands to work, you will often succeed even far beyond your expectations and plans; and it proves to us that God himself will bless those who put their trust in Him and go forward. We may suppose, moreover, that He designed in this manner to prepare the way for a long life of usefulness on the part of our new friend. Never be discouraged therefore. If any of you need help, you will be very sure of it if you go forward and contend with difficulties in the spirit of Christian confidence and virtue." 
               The word was now given for further progress in the work. They first named this place where they had dines, "Half-way Lunch," and then, with their hands and tools, soon erected some rough steps by which they scaled the first, and only perpendicular cliff in their route. Then, preceded by their engineers, they dug their way along the brow of this cliff, making very little ascent for some distance. Presently they came to the surface of a rock, on the side of which it was necessary to wind around where there was very little foot hold. The sappers, drilles, miners were now called into requisition, and after a while, they succeeded in loosening here and there a portion of the rock, and in finding decomposed portions, where it was easy to work out a place for the feet. This spot they called the "Grand Mulets," an Alpine term, and cautioned each other against a mis-step, by which they might easily be thrown down fifty or sixty feet upon the rude fragments below. Then they made a zig-zag, up-hill course, stopping for breath under the shade of an oak. Now the whole troop worked lustily to undermine and roll from its bed in their way a huge rock, and soon they came to a very narrow path close under a large overhanging ledge, and then to a cramped pass-way between trees and rocks, which they called "Thermopyl." Then they wound around this cliff, and scaled that, making as many devious courses as possible to add to the picturesqueness of the path, and to relieve the steepness of the ascent. At last the severity of the hill began to be overcome, the sudden and steep cliffs and projections were all surmounted, and but little now remained, save to indicate the course by removing decayed branches, leaves, and loose boulderes. This was soon done; and having reached a huge pine-tree overhanging the rocks, around which they had wrought so diligently in their upward which they had wrought so diligently in their upward ascent, the pruner was loudly called for, to find a tall young sapling, cut and trim it, while others prepared a heavy cluster of evergreen branches. Lashing these to the end of the stick, they ascended the tree, and pushed it far above the branches, and so securely fastened it to the trunk of the tree with nails and cords, as to defy the winds to looses it, even those terrible tempests that often swept over Bluff Rock. It could be seen far off in the valley, especially from the Institute, and indicated the exact point on the brow of the hill, where the new path reached the summit. 
               Having gained the brow, and worked their path to where it intersected with the main route to the "Cave," they nailed to the trees a board which they had brought with them, on which Castlereagh had rudely painted the words, "Seminary Path," and drawn a large hand, which a finger pointing in the direction to it. Then they marked the trees, and endeavored to make the path plain where it joined the other. It needed not the word of command from the conductor to lay aside the tools. Every one was tired, and fully satisfied with the labor performed. Some cast themselves on the dry leaves, and rolled about; others sat down, wiped away the perspiration, and fanned themselves with their caps; and others still leaned against the trees and panted. 
                
               After a few moment's rest, they all prepared to run forward to the peak or bare summit of Bluff Rock, where the view of the valley, city and ocean is magnificent and uninterrupted, when they were arrested by the approach of voices-merry, laughing, shouting voices of ladies. Presently a very large party of young ladies, the pupils of Miss D's school in G-- street, who had come out form the city accompanied by their teachers, for a Saturday's romp, emerged from the cover of the thickly-growing cedars that overspread the path to the "Cave," and were gayly chatting and hopping along, when suddenly beholding our party of young scholars and workers all clustered around Castlereagh, and in a state of high excitement, such as we have described, the foremost of the advancing party halted and recoiled on the next, and so they all finally came together into a thick cluster, looking less alarmed than surprised. Castlereagh and his party were equally astonished at such an interview. For a moment only the two parties stood thus surveying each other; then Castlereagh perceived that the strangers were the pupils of the school mentioned above, and that a teacher accompanied them with whom he was somewhat acquainted. Without any further delay he approached the party, and accosting the lady, the whole company forthwith became quite ar ease, as they notices their mutual acquaintance. Castlereagh motioned to his lads to fall back, and conducted the young ladies and their teacher a little way into the new path they had made. They looked over the cliff from the signal pine, and traced here and there the winding course of the path far down toward the valley. 
               "When we return, Miss H--, may we not descend this way?" inquired one of the young lady-pupils. 
               "Perhaps so, Miss Janette; unless it should lead us too far from our carriages, and cause us more fatigue." 
               "It will be very little further for you," said Castlereagh; "and I will wait for you to conduct you down, if you like." 
               "Oh! thank you, sir, we shall need no assistance, and would prefer the excitement of finding our way alone." 
               "At least, allow me to send one of my young pupils as a guide to the 'Cave'!" 
               "You are very kind indeed, sir, but pray excuse me if I decline it. We know the way to it, having frequently been there, and there are no dangers now on these heights, even from the 'king's commandment. 
               "If there was danger, we should certainly insist on your acceptance of a guard from our brave young band. As it is, we shall content ourselves with the offer, and your polite declinative." 
               During the whole of the conversation Marshall stood leaning against a tree with his hat somewhat drawn over his face, neither saying a word nor moving from his position. 
               the party of ladies at length passed on, tripping away as gayly as at the first; and now, bounding and shouting, our lads rushed along the path by which the others came to the summit rock. 
               "Did you know any of those ladies, Marshall?" inquired Castlereagh, as they walked along together. 
               "Know them! yes, indeed. I know half of them." 
               "Why did n't you speak to them, eh?" 
               "Oh! I had n't any thing to say, and I was curious to see if they would recognize me, especially my old acquaintance, Janette Patterson, from the same town as myself and an old schoolmate." 
               "Indeed!" 
               "Yes, sir. She did not recognize me. And there was another pretty young lady among them, who threw my room-mate a beautiful bouquet at commencement-oh-hum-well. they didn't seem to know me." 
               "My good fellow, you don't know. You can't always at such times whether you are discerned or not. If you will believe me, I heard that same young lady; Miss Janette Patterson, whisper your name to her teachers, Miss H--, when we stood together by the pine-tree." 
               Marshall started. "Now," said he; "is that true? Is it possible? I declare it is too bad, I would have made her my best bow had I known this. so I fooled myself, after all!" But there was no remedy; so Marshall walked on. 
               At last the party returned and began their descent. And now the lads, with the agility and sure-footedness of goats, ran and pursued one another, bounding from point to point in the path, and leaving Castlereagh and Marshall, heavily burdened with tools, far in the rear. In a few moments a great shouting from below reached their ears, and they hurried along to know what it could mean. Presently, up the wild path-way, comes Johnnie, running along, and creeping after him, Hobbie! 
               "Oh! oh! my little mountain-goats!" cried the happy father. 
               "Ah! ha! father," shouted the lads; "and mamma is here, and all the folks," cried Hobbie. Sure enough, at "Half-way Lunch," there were all the ladies of the family, Sarah Matilda, Henrietta, Eleanor, Gertrude, Stella, Isable, and Roxanna come out to meet the party. Some of them proceeded up the path quite to the signal pine, but, returning, they rejoined the main company at the bridge leading into the village, and all were soon once more at home. 
               In this manner did Castlereagh often gratify his pupils, and by an open common familiarity, he acquired a very great influence over them. In this manner he paid attention to their health, and seldom saw any occasion to call a physician to administer to them a nauseating medicines. Thus the confinement and constrained strained position of the school-room were broken up; and bodily vigor in the place of weakness; grace, instead of awkwardness, were acquired. After a day's exercise and recreation, like this, how sweet and firm was the sleep which sealed the eyes of all when evening's rest-hour came, and Slumber's arms enfolded them. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               THE ASSOCIATION MEETS-ITS BUSINESS-ITS DINNER-ITS REMONSTRANCE. 
                
                  
                      
                        To give the news, 
                        To give reviews, 
                        To give the dues to Brown and HUGHES, 
                        And so away with all the blues. 
                     
                   
                
               IT was nine o'clock Sabbath morning, and two clergyman sat by the way-side, in the shade of a grove, familiarly conversing with each other. They were out walking, each to the other's parish, to fulfill an exchange arrangement, and had met together at this point. One of them was more robust and heavier than the other, although not in all respects wearing a healthier expression of countenance. He was one of the cheerful-consistently cheerful ministers of the vicinity, a good, devoted, holy man, who had labored hard for his Saviour, and successfully so-whose reward was on high. Between him and Castlereagh, who now sat beside him, there had been a close and pleasing acquaintance from the hour when as young men, Freshmen designati, they sat together for the first time in the gallery of the chapel, and were directed by Professor K-- to decline "hic, hc, hoc," and to render a line of English prose into Latin; by Professor W--, to translate, '                ; by Professor S--, to give the geography of the German states-always a rather difficult matter-and to name the principal tributaries of the Mississippi on the west; by Tutor St. J--, to translate in Cicero's oration for the poet Archias, "Quam multos scriptores rerum suarum magnus ille Alexander secum habusie dicitur! Atque is tamen cum in Sigeo ad Achillis tumulum ad stitisset. O fortunate" inquit "adolescens, qui tu virtutis Homerum prconem inveneris!" by Professor O--, to divide in vulgar fraction 15 of 2/7/7/9 of 7/ of 7/10/3 by 45/9/7 of 3/4 of /3 of 2/4/7."-Ans. Given "3x-2+24=31 to find x"-and so forth and so on, in those days hard work-in these, O, fallacious memory! harder. They were now, some years having intervened, in neighboring parishes, preachers of the Word of Life, and teachers, too, of the young. Mr. W-- having erected a large, imposing edifice on the summit of an oak and chestnut-crowned hillock, "beautiful for situation," rising out of the plain, and neighboring upon a thickly crowned cedar-ridge in the rear, where the muses had an arbor, and Cupid hung his quiver. A chosen spot, and fitly shapen by its owner, for the proper education and accommodation of twenty-five or thirty young misses, who were all resident in his family and cultured under his eye. He was, we have said, a good and faithful man. Yes, and beloved, too, and honored. To his family, how much endeared. Among his young pupil protgs, how much venerated and esteemed; in his parish, idolized; in the association, listened to with great respect. At the age of nineteen he left the blacksmith's forge and became one of the scholastici. And now they meet thus. It is the Sabbath. Their parishes are separated three miles, and as the distance allows it, they usually walk thus to and fro. As they sit together by the way side, it is pleasant to speak to one another of the past and of the present, especially of that good Providence by which their way in life has been directed, and His smile fallen on them and their families. 
                
                  W. 
                  I feel invigorated by the walk this morning, and fresh for my work. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  It is a delightful morning, but I am rather stiff with some extra exertion of yesterday. 
                
                
                  W. 
                  Yes! Well, I hope you will find such a good day in the sanctuary that you will forget yourself, and at last realize that you have by one day's work cured another's. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  That is Dr. B--'s process, "keeping up the excitement." 
                
                
                  W. 
                  A very good one it is, too. But, in spite of me, Castlereagh, I am sad to-day. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  No. And wherefore sad? 
                
                
                  W. 
                  I have just parted with Mr. N--, one of my excellent deacons. Yesterday we laid him down in his grave, there to sleep till Jesus calls him. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Is it so? Is Deacon N-- no more? He whom I knew so well, and whom I met, as it seems, but yesterday in the city? 
                
                
                  W. 
                  He is gone, sir. His sickness was short, but sufficient. I mourn his absence, although well assured he has gone to the better land. I saw him often during his illness, and he died in the hope of a blessed immortality. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Then, let not his death distress you. God will raise up in his place some other friend and helper for you, and you will be enabled to say "It is well; let Him do as seemeth to Him best." 
                
                
                  W. 
                  I doubt it not. And yet how mysterious are the ways of God. Deacon N-- was in the prime of life, with a family looking to him for support, enjoying the confidence of the church, and extremely well qualified to serve in his office there. But still, he is cut down, and all the people, and I among them, mourn. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Saddening, and even discouraging as is such an event at any time, in every place, yet, oh! how much better that one should die mourned over as a child of God, than bemoaned as a grievous sinner and stumbling-block, hopeless and unforgiven. 
                
                
                  W. 
                  I grant it-I rejoice in it. I am resigned to the will of God, and yet ever since I parted from him, my mind has been oppressed. It will wear off by and by. And now, brother, you will attend the Convention at A--, I suppose? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I hope to do so. 
                
                
                  W. 
                  It is my intention, if possible. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You will be at the Association next Wednesday? 
                
                
                  W. 
                  Oh. of course!-Good-by. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Farewell; a good time to you. 
                
               That day evening found both the pastors at their own homes, having enjoyed another opportunity so grateful to the heart of the ministers of Christ, of preaching the Gospel of the Lord Jesus to attentive, if not awakened congregations of hearers. 
               The Association met on Wednesday at the usual morning hour. It was assembled in the study of Rev. --, and there were present twelve clergymen; Castlereagh was present-W-- was not present. When Castlereagh entered the room, accompanied by Rev. Mr. --, several were already in, chatting in the most easy, earnest, and familiar manner, the hour not having quite arrived at which the business of the Association commenced. Immediately friendly greetings went round the circle, and the new-comers were soon installed in their places in the group, and lent their voices to the common hum. Presently others are announced the greetings are renewed, nods, and smiles, and shaking of hands, introductions of strangers; the hour has come also. Much business awaits the association, and the Annual Moderator calls to order. 
                
               "Brethren! shall the Association be opened with prayer?" 
               Immediately every knee is bent in devotion. The prayer is an impressive one. It is a confession of unworthiness, but expresses the joy of every pious heart that God has "counted him faithful, putting him into the ministry" of the Lord Jesus. It is full of reverence. It breaks forth into thanksgiving; it implores the divine blessing on all the labors of Christ's embassadors, the descent of the Holy Spirit on all the churches, the revival of the pure work of grace and salvation to be sent forth unto all the ends of the earth. Then follows the Greek lesson, a critical reading, and study, and a very animated and free conversation over it, of a portion of the Acts of the Apostles from the Greek Testament, each member reading two verses in his turn. The time consumed in this exegetical study is about an hour and a half; and so deeply interested are all the members, that the time expires long before they are perceptibly wearied. It is a happy feature in their programme, and awakens often much enthusiasm, warm discussion, interminable varieties of exegesis, great research of Gesenius, Calmet, Robinson, Kitto, Henry, Doddridge, Barnes, Stuart, Hackett; opinions bold, opinions cautious, opinions strenuous, opinions timid, opinions novel, opinions obsolete, opinions shading into one another, opinions strikingly dissimilar, are advanced on almost every verse that is read. And how many subjects for sermons are in this study of the Acts presented sented to every mind! What a rich portion of the New Testament is this same Acts! Do all men so regard it? Certainly they would, were they carefully and candidly to peruse it. 
               Now the books are closed, and half an hour is passed in strict religious devotion, in prayer, exhortation, praise. Truly my soul wait thou on God. It is good to be there, to hear the pastors speak, and pray, and sing as do other men, deploring their own unworthiness, but ascribing praise to God for the blessings of his grace and salvation. They seek direction, they ask for wisdom; they can not be denied a father's blessing. 
               And then the business matter of the Association proceeds again. There is a call for the Dissertation. This is a carefully prepared document on a subject given out at a previous gathering. Its reading is followed by discussion, not on the merits of the article presented, but on the question itself. The subjects chosen are sometimes exegetical on a Scriptural reading, or theological on some point of doctrine, dogma, or principle; or they are on practical duty, religious biography, etc., etc. Now we have the Scriptural significance of baptism in the Church; anon, the argument in favor of Christ's divinity; at another time, an inquiry into the power of Edwards as a preacher. And again: "How may the lay element in the Church be the most profitably employed?" Every member is questioned: "What have you to say on this subject?" This is also a pleasing and an instructive season. Hardly is it ended ere the dinner-hour arrives, for the members all dine to-gether at the house where meets the Association. 
               A minister's admiration of a good dinner has been sometimes his reproach. Why he should not now and then enjoy a sumptuous feast as well as do other men, we can not see. That he loves it, is but saying that in this he resembles mankind in general. To forbid it him, especially when met in a circle of his own brethren, for the purpose of recreation and repose from study, is a petty tyranny. A man who rises from a groaning table, where he has partaken of every delicacy that could be procured, and even drowned the feast afterward with wine, can with very little taste or justice, say: "Give a clergyman porridge; it is good enough for him." That's depravity's judgment. Judgments may hereafter, in a comparison of one man with another, be reversed. Who knows? 
               While the members wait the summons in the parlors, they read the papers, the Tribune, the Times, etc., etc. They gather in small circles of three or four; they examine the engravings on the wall; it is rather an idle five minutes or ten-a yawning, stretching time. Presently the doors are thrown open, and the repast is duly announced. 
               The dinner is highly convivial. Business is laid aside. The carvers, the gravy-waiters, the condiment helpers, the lookers-on, all play their part. The carvers are cleaving rich cuts transversely from an enormous beef-roast. Fat turkey boiled, fatter roasted, are carved-scientifically carved, every secret joint severed, and the white and dark meat awaits your choice. The dissevered portions lie piled and savory around the dish. Many are the compliments to the carvers, many to the host by the dissectors, for the true metal of the blades. 
               "Any thing but a dull carver; thanks, Brother -- for this keen blade. Now gentlemen, what will you have?" 
               And then the well-cloven cold ham is delicately shaven down. And lest some epicurean expectancy may not be gratified without it, mine host has also provided a chicken pie in a large yellow dish, boiled chickens, oyster pies, of course, and a halibut steak. Every dish has its own gravy, beef, boiled and roasted turkey, chickens, halibut. Oyster soup is lavished on the well-fattened turkeys and chickens. There are potatoes mashed and browned in butter, common uncommon, and sweet. There are turnips in choice varieties, beets, onions, pickles, and cranberry sauce. These are a part of the convivial feast! 
               "What will you have, sir?" 
               Ah! ha! a difficult question to settle if you have all, a difficult selection if a part, utterly impossible to take a little. But all are satisfactorily supplied at last, and every member is very busy and very facetious and happy. It taken a long time to tell over the events of a month, to give and take what comes to hand, to give the news, to gives reviews, to give the dues to Brown and Hughes, and so away with all the blues. But is the dinner now over? By no means. This course is removed, every dish is taken away, the crumbs brushed off, the table made ready for further enjoyment. There is one very happy feature in the removal. It is this. The little daughters of the host often, with nimble fingers and on light-stepping feet, busy themselves with the "help" and "mercury" offficials in this department, and in replacing dishes for the second course. The little grand-daughter of Mr. N--, a highly respected and wealthy gentleman of the city, father of clergyman G--, is not ashamed to perform this service, and while her smiling parents approve, their guests lavish on her their sincere compliments. And the delicate little ones of the departed grandsire, the devoted and distinguished Mr. T--, refined and beautiful children as they are the idols of their youthful parents, go smiling and hopping around the well-loaded tables in the same active, not inappropriate, duty. But to the dinner-alias, the dessert. Mine host and hostess, one at each end of the table, dip out most highly-flavored custard-pine, or custardquince, while others lend a knife and cut eagerly into the several varieties of pies that are unstintedly ranged along on either side, for the tables are richly set out again, tempting you with pies, pudding, custards, delicious jellies, fragrant sweetmeats; apples, raisins, grapes, nuts, follow, and where is the end? An hour goes by-shall I say sometimes nearly two?-ere the great dispatch is off, the generous host and hostess satisfied, the richly fed guests satisfied, the wants of nature equipoised, and members have all thrice told their well-remembered tales. They wind their way back to the session-rooms. And while a member reads the sermon, his critics and reviewers, some of them walk the room with a light tread, others occasionally nodding, get distant and uncertain views of things, of text, subject, division, argument and close. And some lounge on their neighbor's chair-backs, and others gaping through watery eyes, gaze on the reader puffing through his heavy task. The hour wearily rolls off. The members wake up. They have all heard the sermon! Some have taken notes! They like and they dislike. They commend this, and they censure that. The talk goes briskly round. They are all themselves again. The dinner is a past reminiscence! Then we come to a very busy, entertaining, and instructive scene, an hour where the sands drop fast. It is the account by every member of his month's reading. Some confess that they, by reason of absence, the hurry and the worry of life, have done little during the past thirty days that they care to mention, and slide as easily as possible into the outer circle where they can listen. Others have read the Tribune, the Times, the Express, the Independent, the Post, the Evangelist, the Sun, the New-Englander, the Bibliotheca, the Foreign Quarterlies, the Eclectic-
                
                
               "No, no," says the Moderator; "we are all supposed to have read the papers." 
               "No very easy task, sir, though," retorts the victim. 
               "Any standard works, or miscellaneous writings, sir?" inquires the Moderator. 
               "Ah! beg your pardon, sir. I have been wading through Neander." 
               "Was it muddy, sir, or deep water?" 
               "Ha! indeed sir, I find Neander is neither muddy nor deep, for 'deep' supposes bottom; unfathomable." 
               "Then you have touched neither bottom nor shore in Neander?" 
               "I made the shore of many of his ideas, I am happy to say, sir; but have been often floundered. Further, I think Neander highly suggestive and profitable. 'He who reads him for solid instruction will find himself abundantly rewarded.'
                     PUTNAM, p. 448. Good article, April, 1855.
                   Like my young neighbor J--, I am almost determined to learn the German, to read him in his own tongue." 
               "Well, sir, that would be folly. Any thing further, sir?" 
               "Yes, sir. I have read Arnold's Sermons. I have reperused Morell. I am passionately fond of these writers, and think them among the best we have. 
               "Rev. Mr. -- has read Roget's Thesaurus of English words, and highly commends it, also the UNCLE TOM literature, and the 'SIDE' Miscellanies. Another has perused rused with great interest John Foster's life and correspondence. A large month's reading is detailed, going over the recent valuable publications of all sorts of writers-an account not confined to recent authors, but having extensive reference also to standard works long highly venerated and esteemed. 
               "Brethren," says the Moderator, "we will now hear about the sermons preached the past month." 
               The members produce their sermons, and when called on, give the text and subject of each discourse, and when it was preached. Some have written four, others five, six, seven, or eight sermons since they last met together. This is an interesting part of the business. Fifty to eighty sermons have been prepared, and are now presented. They show that the writers have been occupied with an intense desire to preach "the kingdom of God" among men-to proclaim the great truths of Gospel repentance, faith, and salvation-to arouse the slumbering consciences of sinners-to convince them of their entire depravity, and need of the Holy Spirit-to begin, to carry on, and to perfect in them the righteousness of God their Saviour. 
               After this, "Questions for Advice, and Plans for Doing Good?" is the formal inquiry of the programme. Some have trouble, have had, or expect to, and being heard, are counseled. Many are the plans for doing good: one has a Tuesday evening Bible class for young men; another is lecturing upon the Bible; still another labors in the Sabbath-school at noon; and another other has started a five o'clock meeting in a grove, two or three miles distant from the church, among a class of men who neglect the Sabbath. One proposes that greater efforts be made in behalf of temperance; another pleads in behalf of the monthly concert of prayer. All are united in their desire that more of a spirit of prayer for the blessing of God should abound in the Church. 
               After the place and time of the next meeting have been agreed on, and all the appointments made, the Association is adjourned with prayer. 
               On the morrow these pastors are found in their respective parishes, laboring in their studies with renewed pleasure and zeal, or among their people, going from house to house, visiting the sick, conversing with the impenitent and worldly, and on every side of them exciting an influence of the kind New England has felt for two hundred years! Is it surprising, therefore, that a body of such men-3,050 strong-should have a moral power in their REMONSTRANCE against a public wrong, exceeding that of commen men, and yet it should be only a remonstrance?
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               DIARY-ARGUMENT AT DINNER AGAINST MARSHALL AND HIS DEMOCRACY. 
               DIARY. Oct.--Hurrying down to take the cars for Albany, whom should I encounter but my good friend, Deacon D--, an intelligent man, delegate from the church in N-- to the Convention. We sat together nearly the whole trip through. On the same train was the Reverend H. W. B--, who, being in a hurry to get through, rode forward on the cow-catcher! "Saints, sinners, and the Beecher family!" Met Clifford and his mother there. Clifford is now the highly respected pastor of the rich parish of L--, and in his new sphere of labor, finds but little leisure for rambling abroad. Found him in the last seat of the last car in the train, which was of great length, looking out on the magnificent scenery of the Highlands. "This," said he, "provided you have any desire to see the country, is the only good seat in the cars." Thought I, "Odd men show their oddities in very odd sort of ways." We arrived safely. I was disappointed that W--, who was slightly unwell at the meeting of the Association, and so detained from it, was not present at the Convention, which passed off very happily. It was voted to raise $50,000 in the churches, by a simultaneous collection, on the first Sabbath of January, as a fund to go toward the erection of church edifices at the West. A noble object-in the eye of faith, resplendently glorious to the land and the world. Many a stirring speech was made on this occasion-many brothers shook hands then for the first and the last time. It was a great drift of fine scholars, many of them eminent divines, and many notable lay brethren in the Church. 
               
                  Oct. 15.-Went to-day into the school and heard the Latin classes throughout, recitation being in Virgil, Cicero, Viri Rom, and Reader. My boys seem to be improving, on the whole, but their rendering was, in some cases, awkward. In the afternoon, declamation by Amos-good; ditto by Harry Otis and Fitz Maurice; compositions by girls, very creditable. A fine school paper, edited by Miranda, Gertrude, and Eleanor, was read by the latter, and included a very rich sonnet, contributed by herself. The school was not altogether quiet. One of the boys was called to the platform and made to stand there for his disposition to inquietude. There were present a few ladies and gentlemen as visitors. 
               
                  Oct. 20.-To-day, in the city, heard alarming intelligence of W--. Suddenly he has begun to droop. The physician says he does not "rally" at all. The people are bewildered and shocked by the news. Have made arrangements to go and see him to-morrow. Knock! "Come in." 
                
                  Mina. 
                  Sir, Deacon N-- is below, and would be glad to see you. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Very well. I will go down directly. 
                
               Deacon N-- came to tell me that he had heard of Mr. W--'s illness, and to offer me his horse if I wished to go and see him. So telling him my plans, he left. Mr. S-- called with an order on the treasurer for an hundred dollars of the salary, for which I felt truly grateful. My two notes on the bank come due in three days, and I have now the prospect of meeting them without much further trouble. He had hardly left, when ALICE called, en route for Richmond, and protesting she had not a moment to stay, pressed her children, Hayden and Stella, to her heart and darted away to her carriage. Forgetting, however one errand with Sarah Matilda, back she came, and having made known her object in the mean time laid off her hat, and bidding Hayden see that the horse was secured, declared she would not leave till after tea. 
               At this the girls and boys all gathered around her, and as usual, when she tarries with us, there were lively times for an hour. She rallied Marshall on looking sober, and Marshall, to prove that he was not sober broke into an immoderate fit of laughter. This produced a very great excitement in Miss Henrietta's mind, who declared the scene was perfectly dramatic. At the tea-board, the highest good-humor prevailed, and little Hobbie laughed once so crazily that he caught the hiccoughs. Once he upset his glass of water, and once his knife fell on to the floor. Mortified at his ill-luck, he then burst into tears, exclaiming, "It is too, too bad, fader" (he trips on "father" even yet), "there is nothing but ackidents." Hobbie is forgiven amid a burst of merriment, in which the little fellow recovers his equanimity, and laughs too. And now Alice says "she will go, and nothing shall stop her," not even Mina's excellent third-proffered cup. We all rise, all flutter round her, all say good-by a dozen times-when lo! here comes Hayden from the post-office with a long-expected letter. "But what does this mean?" says she wildly, as she breaks the envelop and reads. "Why here is a fifty dollar note only, and I ought to have three hundred and fifty dollars!-'check?' There is no check-I have not received any of late-again, then I am robbed! Castlereagh, what shall I do? I have lost one hundred dollars before, and now where are my checks sent in letters previous to this." The long and short of the matter was, that she felt it her duty to turn her carriage and ride back to the city, accompanied by Hayden, in order thoroughly, in person, to investigate the difficulty. "Here then I go," said she, muffling herself up as she took her carriage; "having nothing to do, as Mrs. R-- tells me, 'but to ride round and take my comfort!'" This, which was said with the most facetious expression in the midst of great outward discomfort, and in great perturbation of mind, produced an universal clapping, and away she rode, burying her face in her shawl, and weeping-yes, convulsively and sadly weeping-yet remembering the consolatory Scripture, "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in is holy habitation." 
               
                  Oct. 23.-My own birthday-and the release-day of the beloved W--, from earth! Who would have predicted such an event four weeks ago, when every thing around him was fair and promising? What human eye could have looked along into his future, and espied the flight of his arrow? I have passed three days and nights with his family, and endeavored to render them assistance. W--, has been in a wild and painful state for three days, not knowing any one, and with but one brief and lucid interval, so has died. 
               
                  Oct. 25.-To-day the grave has received the remains of this dear brother. There were present at his funeral a large and weeping company of his bereaved people. They appeared like seep who have been bereaved of their shepherd, and feel their lonely and exposed condition. Yesterday, I left my own pulpit with another, and preached to them. His afflicted wife, sending off her family to church, sat and watched the Sabbath hours away over the still form of her departed husband, communing with her own heart, and gathering strength from God for her last parting Never have I passed such another Sabbath-day in the congregations of God's people. Adapting my discourses to the state of things among them, their hearts and my own became deeply affected, and there was a very general weeping through the whole house. To-day the funeral services have been a prayer at the house, by the Rev.-, his own former pastor, and public services in the old church, just ready to be torn down, as the people have erected, by the side of it, a new, and very tasteful modern church edifice. W-- indulged himself in the pleasing anticipation of worshiping with is people in it; but no-he has fallen asleep. From the walls of the old edifice, where the fathers of ancient memory have led the devotions of God's people, he has been taken to his grave. Many of the neighboring clergymen were present; clergymen are the pall-bearers; clergymen lower the coffin into its narrow bed; clergymen speak, and weep at his grave. And by and by the tide of human life that has flowed together around his sepulcher begins again to ebb. The great swell is broken, and rolls away. Here and there a few go among the graves, or one lingers as the sexton toils on to end his task; but most had gone, and W-- is alone, cold, forsaken, to be forgotten by living men until the   
                  (rising-up) of the last day. Can any friend that knew him doubt that his resurrection will be unto Life Eternal?
                     Rev. EDWARD WRIGHT.
                   How many families of ministers in this vicinity have been called to similar afflictions. I now recall to mind the following, and there may be others; Rev. Mr. B-- has lost an affectionate son and daughter; Rev. Mr. C--, his beloved son; Rev. Mr. T--, wife; Rev. Mr. B--, son; Rev. Mr. W--, son; Rev. Mr. P--, child; Rev. Mr. B--, wife; Rev. Mr. D-- was himself taken away when far from home; Rev. Mr. A--. wife. I have but to run the record a little further back, and it brings in the whole! Such then is human life. It is short at best, and always liable to an immediate interruption. On every grave-stone there is written, as it were, the startling language, "Be ye also ready, for in such an hour, as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh." 
               
                  Nov. 10.-the fever which carried off brother W-- has prevailed extensively in his family. The pupils have taken it; the school has been temporarily disbanded. One or two of the pupils have died. I, indeed, felt ill myself for a few days, but have now recovered. 
               
                  Nov. 15.-To-day, Marshall said to me, "Mr. C., you have, I think, a very great tenacity of life." 
               "Why so?" I inquired. 
               "Because," said he, "you do a great amount of business of one kind and another, without giving out, and yet have by no means a robust, healthy expression. When you left my room last summer, after engaging me to come here, I said, 'There goes a dead man in the course of six weeks.'" 
                
               "Indeed!" exclaimed I, with a sudden start. 
               "Yes," he continued; "you had a sickly, cadaverous expression that I could but notice; and it remained long on my mind." 
               "And how do I appear to you to-day?" inquired I. 
               "Oh, for that matter," said he, "'neither better not worse,' as a certain boy once said of his grandfather, 'but a little on the gain,'" 
               
                  Dec. 1.-To-day three of the boys were kept after school in consequence of coming in late from the ice. Henrietta also was obliged to reprimand two of the young ladies for continued thoughtlessness and giddiness of manner. On the whole, the school is doing well. This term closes at Christmas. 
               
                  Dec. 2.-Two gentlemen called to-day to engage places for their sons next term. 
               
                  Dec. 3.-Marriage took place this morning in the church between two of my young friends, Mr. -- and Miss --. The church was crowded with observers. 
               
                  Dec. 4.-Hayden is determined to skate, and unless he can have liberty to do as he likes about it, prepares a very poor lesson. Some of the other boys appear equally bad. Marshall is troubled by it. I must see to it. 
               
                  Dec. 5.-General rule in school to-day, that the bell of the Institute shall be rung for the accommodation of the skaters at noon, fifteen minutes before school. 
               
                  Dec. 8.-Great scampering of the boys to be in school to-day in season, George Haliday having unfortunately been suspended a day or two for breaking over the rule. Every thing goes right again. I gently pulled Harry Otis's ear to-day, and notified Amos that he was careless. 
               
                  Dec. 10.-Some of the boys are rather too fond of the young ladies. They would, apparently, take the very highest pleasure in their society half the time-nay, the whole of it! But the rules of the Institute are positive on this point, and the interchange of sly looks when the great doors are open, and covert notes, forwarded on occasions when we can not detect them and use preventive measures, constitute the principal offenses as yet detected. Recently I found the following delicate morceau in the rubbish papers: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "MY DEAR FLOWER,-
                            
                           Do not suppose that I forgot you last evening. I hoped that I could go to the Psychological Lecture for the purpose of a little glance, to say the least, at you. But, oh! dear, my lesson-my lessons. The neversatisfied teachers say they are of the utmost consequence. So does the priest, himself. How do they know any thing about sentiment? But, farewell. I hope not too long. Adieu-adieu
                            
                           
                              "From your own 
                              "ROSE-BUSH."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               I could but laugh. I was vexed; and at the same time I knew that it was wholly out of my power to do any thing to alter this absurdity. A few days since I observed to the school, that any attempt to crowd open the folding doors during recess, and any gazing through the forced opening of the doors, or any rapping on the doors or window-blinds, to call attention, would be followed by an immediate public exposure and expulsion. The young ladies all seemed frightened, and not to know what I could mean; the young gentlemen looked entirely innocent and wondering. Poor things! do I not know more of them than they imagine? 
               
                  Dec. 12.-Marshall is indefatigable in teaching and training my pupils. He will not overlook one important lesson or rule; and though so strictly disciplinary, he is also companionable. The boys, at the breakfast and dinner-table, sometimes argue with him, and run tilt against his democracy. His replies not unfrequently unhorse them, and flounder them in the mud. In general, the discussion is in very good part and respectful, though frequently very highly spiced. I admire the principles that he avows, and really maintains. He will vote for good men of his own party, if they are nominated to fill public offices; but if not, will vote for good men of the opposite party. This exposes him to some sharp shots from his antagonists, all of whom are young whigs. 
               "Then you have n't any good men among your democrats?" 
                
                  Marshall. 
                  We don't always bring forward what we have got. 
                
                
               "Very likely; you are afraid of exhausting the supply, perhaps?" 
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Ha! ha! Not exactly; we reserve something to give away to the whigs. 
                
               "Oh, your are extremely generous," said Eleanor, who has quite a love of politics, and reads the "Daily" with great interest to keep up with the times. She also seems to tke expecial delight in helping the boys against him;-"you are generous," said she; "a generosity, however, that leads you to give away to one that you may take away the more from another. Is it not, sir?" 
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Ah! ha! "it 's you, is it?" as Mina says, that we must reply to? Well, the democracy can afford to be generous where consistency to party law requires it sometimes to be severaly just. 
                
                
                  Eleanor. 
                  Ah! then it was justice that led the new Administration to turn out the clerks and auditors at Washington, and the postmasters at New York, Bostton and Baltimore. 
                
                
                  Marshall. 
                  A sort of justice, to be sure-none the worse for being christened 'arbitrary.' 
                
                
                  Boys. 
                  Then it is not vindictive justice? 
                
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Ha! ha! Oh, no. 
                
                
                  Harry O. 
                  It is retaliatory, I suppose? 
                
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Why! the whigs have never deserved any retaliation, I hope? 
                
                
                  Sarah Matilda. 
                  If they have, might not an Administration, strong in its constituency, abundant in its resources, and popular in its dogmas, rule out the retaliatory principle, and be lenient-merciful? 
                
               "Good! good! good!" exclaimed the boys and girls, while Castlereagh looked up from his dinner askance at Marshall, determined on helping him, if he was in trouble. But he was shaking with merriment, and strong in his argument, so Castlereagh did not interfere. 
                
                  Henirietta. 
                  You are fairly floored now, Mr. Marshall. I don't see one single chance for you to recover yourself. 
                
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Well, it looks rather dark, to be sure. But we must not forget that the truth is with us somewhere; if so, we should not despair of finding it. 
                
                
                  Henrietta. 
                  You may well do so, I think now. What can you say beyond mercy? If your Administration is unmerciful, of course it is unjust. 
                
               This highly amused and interested the boys and girls. Castlereagh looked a little uneasy, but Marshall did not seem to mind it. 
                
                  Marshall. 
                  Mrs. Castlereagh? 
                
                
                  Mrs. C. 
                  Well, sir. 
                
               Castereagh laughed, and so did all. 
               "Now," said Marshall, "mercy and justice, we know, sweetly harmonize in perfect system of government. There can not be one without the other. You want that we should separate them, and, by showing mercy, prove ourselves unjust, eh?" 
               "Oh! No, no, no!" exclaimed all. "That is a mere dodge-it is not the sentiment. That is too bad, any how," and so forth, and so forth. 
               Castlereagh calmed them down a little, and Sarah Matilda quickly replied. 
               "The Administration does not need the show of mercy to make its injustice visible and glaring." 
               There was a great tumult at these words, and even Castlereagh could not refrain from uniting in it. Marshall exclaimed, 
               "Oh! my poor, down-trodden democracy, what shall I do? I wish I had a few ladies on my side to help defend it." 
               Shella, Isabel, and Gertrude replied, "You shall have, Mr. Marshall; we will help you." 
               "You!" said Hayden. 
               "Yes we," said Stella. "I wonder if the poor man does not need help?" 
               At this there was another round of merriment. 
               "We should never despise the day of small things." said Marshall; and the laugh rolled over rather heavily against Stella. 
               "You had better not despise it," said she, "for you would then, I fear, despise the chief glory of your Administration." 
               This, which was said archly and suddenly in retaliation, cut as keenly as any repartee that had preceded it, and the boys were excessively proud of their young companion. Marshall said the day was fairly gone, and begged for a little drop of mercy. They all told him it would prove them "unjust," and so compelled him to fight it out, which he did very manfully till the bell called them all away to school. Among other defenses that he adopted, were these. He said, 
               "If there are forty thousand whigs to be turned out of office, it is not so much from want from of mercy to them, as to show political justice to others." "It is a poor party that can not provide for its own." "The whigs after fighting against us, and being even now opposed to our Administration, would demean themselves to beg for office under us, or even to accept it; we accordingly do them a real favor when we compel them to show their manhood and go out.' "Out Adminstration came into power by the votes of its friends. These now claim its favors-who can show a better right to them? To whom can they, according to any proper rate of distribution, be given if not to them?" "When you come into office, eat your own venison." 
               On the whole, the argument was not very decisive on either side, and, a usual in politics, it was left open for further discussion. But the boys and girls thought Marshall a little harder pressed than he had sometimes been. Marshall cared little for it, and went whistling to his room. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               IDLENESS AND IGNORIUS. 
               AND how does it fare with the sermons in these days? Castlereagh is not forgetful of his duty in respect to them. He uniformly prepares one, often two sermons each week, and preaches them on the following Sabbath. He often labors in the night to do this, and rises early. Sometimes he is weary, frequently he draws long sighs, occasionally presses his hand against his head, and wears a look of care. Still the work goes on. He visits the sick, conversing and praying with them. When any of his people are removed, he prepares himself, and attends to all the duty of the funeral service. He receives, as well as makes calls and visits. His item is occupied. His strength is tasked to the utmost, as it would seem, and yet he rather adds each day to his cares than lessens the number and burden of them. Some interesting cases of seriousness in his society and in the school awaken his solicitude, and lead to renewed exertions and to much watchfulness and prayer. And withal he frequently prepares an article for the religious press, and is found here and there at ordinations, meetings of association, and at temperance gatherings. His reading can not be dispensed with, although it is often extremely hurried. Sarah Matilda reads to him if he retires a little carly, till sleep closes his eyes. In this manner he obtains his missionary news, much of it, and selects interesting portions of the Herald and Home Missionary for his monthly concert of prayer. She reads to him selections from the Quarterlies. She reads him asleep over Butler's Analogy, and marks with a pencil certain suggestive paragraphs to talk over when he shall be awake. He finds his Latin growing rusty, and reads over Cicero, and Virgil. His Greek is slipping from his memory, and he reviews the Iliad. His Hebrew, with or without points, is in danger of becoming an unknown tongue, and he daily reads one of its unmouthable, back-track chapters, having large use for Gesenius. He resolves that he will never let a day pass without reading more or less in the classics, and in the Sacred text; for why should he bestow so large a bounty on poor Idleness and Ignorius, as all the knowledge he has of languages, that cost him years to acquire among his young class-mates, and that fitted him for usefulness, and placed him as a scholar and a thinker among men of this cast? A good deal of this sort of largess is, however, being ever contributed, even by our young divines and scholars in other professions and trades. It is given away for the newspapers and Quarterlies; for the long, heavy sermons, which some men never quite understand; for Blackstone, Coke, and Chitty; for the practice of the Materia Medica and surgery; for the chemical analysis of soils. There are some "John Quinzys," some Josiahs, some Everetts, alive in these decades of the Republic, who forget not their studies in political life; few Burrits, Frosts, Mezzofantis. There are many ignoriuses and scholastic drifters. And yet, we may well ask, why should young men know so much, when their knowledge is rated less than clerk-hire or factory-wages? Certainly not for the consideration of dollars and cents. No, for striking a deep mark into the great century column that rises in the pathway of their life. Dwight, Everett, Adams, Alexander, Napoleon, and Washington, began their career of letters and of arms early. The stiff millioniare in Wall street made his first fifty dollars in a "nect or nothing" speculation before he was sixteen. His first five thousand when he was twenty-one. His first hundred thousand before he was twenty-eight. If he had not been worth money at thirty-five, he never would have been. Certainly Alexander had not then conquered the world. Up early, then, young men, if you are ever up. Climb the ladder before the dawn, and you will first see the sunbeams. 
               Castlereagh instilled these principles into the minds of his pupils, and found a thorough assistant in Marshall, who was ever busy and progressive in all departments of study, and prompt to meet every duty and exigency. The young gentlemen of Lindenvale were highly pleased with him for his ardent co-operation with them in their Lyceum and public debates-Castlereagh and his church for his help as a Christian. 
               "Marshall," said Castlereagh, "you will hardly go out to the Lyceum this evening." 
               "Not?" 
               "Will you-it snows, I see." 
               "Well, sir, I can't prevent it snowing; and I don't intend the snow shall prevent me, going." 
               By the church, and especially those who attended the evening prayer-mettings, he was highly esteemed, because he was always an attendant himself, and willing, if so desired, to perform his share of the duty of the meetings. 
               "You will doubtless study for the ministry," said Castlereagh to him in one of their interviews. 
               "Oh, no, sir; I do not intend to do that." 
               "Is it possible, Marshall? why, I have rather set my heart on it! I have taken great pleasure in your exhortations and other exercises in our social meetings, and I know the feeling and expectation of all our brethren lean that way." 
               "I have for a long time had my profession decided on, and think it altogether likely that I shall pursue the course of study that I have marked out for myself-not that I sat all undervalue the ministry, but that my wishes incline me in another direction; and there I can, I think, see a wide field of usefulness." 
                
               "The ministry is not the only profession in which one can be useful," said Castlereagh, "and yet it is probably the one of first important to all young men who are pious, and having become educated, are looking abroad to find the place they can most conscientiously labour in during life, and so fulfill their duty to Christ. I think it has a far higher claim than that of the profession of the law, exceedingly attractive as that may be." 
               "I do not undervalue it, I repeat the remark. But it may be the positive duty of some to engage in other professions, and so, by their life and whole example, preach Christ among a class of men where the clergyman is not heard but with more or less of prejudice, or where religion has far too few admirers anf advocates." 
               "There are, however, many distinguished lawyers in our country, who grace their profession with piety; and I am of the opinion, that Christian lawyers accomplish a very great amount of good. But it is, after all, a serious question for one to decide, whether he shall give up the great and heaven-appointed office of an embassador of Christ, for any of the professions and occupations that relate more particularly to the affairs of time and the world." 
               "We read of Luke, 'the beloved physician.' I have for many a year been decided in my purpose to be a physician. But I have also the firm purpose of taking into my profession, and applying it in my daily practice, the very religion that led Luke to be esteemed and called the beloved." 
               "Well, my dear friend, you have my hearty sympathy and prayers for your success. I think your decision can not fail to lead you into a field where practical religion may develop all her graces, and where you can not but honor the Saviour and be a blessing to the souls of men. A truly pious physician is one certainly whom all men regard with favor and confidence. He is wanted; so is the devotedly pious lawyer. There are too many in all the professions who 'drift' with the current into the great waters of life, where their piety becomes absorbed and so diluted as to be truly nauseating. What is wanted then, is, I am persuaded, the firm, faithful man." 
               "Allow me to say," said Marshall, "that as far as my observation has gone, there are fewer men, in comparison with their numbers, in the different professions who are unfaithful, idle, shrinking, time-serving men, than in the other states of society and phases of life. And if this is so, it is a high testimony certainly in favor of their education." 
               "Education is, I think, favorable to religion," said Castlereagh. "I can not perceive the soundness of any argument against it. An education fits one the more readily to understand the whole world of matter, the entire kingdom of nature, and the provinces of art and science, and to appropriate to himself their concealed advantages. It gives him independece; it gratifies his nature; it makes his companionable; it prepares him for public office and station of the highest responsibility. Indeed, sir, I should prefer that my children, at the age of twenty-one, were both highly educated, rather than possessed of twenty thousand dollars each without an education." 
               "Perhaps I should agree with you, sir, although you are aware that there are multitudes of very good men who would not." 
               "Yes, I know it; money is the great thing now-a-days, and always was, yea, always will be, when men look merely or most intently on the worldly side of things. The 'MONEY-KING' is the great stock-jobber of all ages and places. He rules the mind-market as well as as the stock and sales market, and inquires exultingly, 'What is the use of learning when men can become rich without it?' A great many ministers of the gospel are, I imagine, heavy dealers, with tho money-king jobber. I have met a large number who seemed absolutely posioned with the idea of making money in their profession. They will descent on the subject of salary beyond all its just proportions, and make you half sick with their calculations and estimates." 
               "It is undoubtedly the folly of many of us to be too eager for the 'pay' of our professions." 
               "We shall all be paid, Marshall, if we are faithful, even in the least, at the great universal reward-day. Having a Master in whom we can trust, we can well afford to wait, and, as Baxter said, 'Give away much and need little, living frugally on a little.'" 
               Here the conversation, for the time, was dropped. Marshall went into the school, as the bell was ringing, and Castlereagh sought his study. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               LETTER OF CASTLEREAGH TO REVEREND HENRY WALLAGE-HIS REPLY. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "DEAR FRIEND-
                            
                           "In your last kind letter, you observe that of late the subject of opening a large and richly-furnished institution at Madison, where boys and girls may receive an education of the highest order, has occupied much of your thought. I am happy that one so well calculated, as I deem yourself, to carry out a design of this nature when once undertaken, has the subject under advisement, for the cause of education, in our time, is one of paramount importance and embarrassment, which minds of the highest culture, and men of great firmness and excellent judgment alone can meet and rescue from its difficulties. You ask my opinion as to the desirableness of connecting the two departments in one, or whether it may not be best to give your attention to one sex only? And you also inquire if the care of the school is any very material addition to my other duties? To these question, turning only a passing glance or two, I answer the first of them as follows. If your plan is to furnish a common school for the good of the families of the town of Madison, by all means make it an institution for both sexes. If it is more particularly for your own benefit, and ideal, and has reference to a boarding plan almost, if not entirely, then I would have it for one sex alone. You will need more expensive and enlarged premises, peculiarly constructed, where it is otherwise, and more than double sets of hands. The respect for the school may also be easily lost under this last arrangement, and one's own careless ease and comfort must be greatly endangered. He can not but have a great anxiety of mind for his two classes of pupils brought hourly into so familiar relations. I should point you to the excellent female school at Hadley, commonly known as the Mount Holyoke Seminary, in confirmation of the idea that one sex is better arranged thus by itself, than in company, where a certain course of study is desirable; and so to our colleges and high-schools generally, where boys and young men are educated. But you are familiar with these, and I have leave the subject. 
                           "As to the other question, my answer may be found when I have sone. I begin by saying, in general, the care of my school does add materially to my other duties, by a great confinement to it, and aborption in it of my mind. I came hither from the good old rural town of Richmond, partly to do good, and partly to find relief from exhausting labors. I also anticipated some pecuniary advantage to myself and family from the Institute. I have found my time as much occupied here as it was there. Indeed, my labors, although of a different nature, ar manifold more than ever, while my anxiety respecting the welfare of the school, mentally, morally, physically, and pecuniarily, increases hourly. In the beleif that much time would necessarily be called for by my connection with the school, it was agreed, at my settlement, on the part of the Society, that I might employ myself about the Institution as much as its interests might seem to require. But I little deemed how much this would, in the end, cover-how many hour it would sever me from my people-how greatly it would affect my ministry-how absorbing, in a word, it would become. 
                           "You must look at things as they are, and not as you might wish them, if you are thinking of an enterprise similar to mine. I feel deeply interested in the subject-in my own work-and gratified with many of its issues already raeached, but I am more fully than at first acquainted with its cost. 
                           "Your time will be in a great measure absorbed by the school. It does seem to be as easy a matter now-a-days for a clergyman to teach, and also fulfill the duties of his parish as it once was. You know very well that the Rev. Dr. Bellamy, and the Rev. Dr. Smith, and Rev. Dr. Porter, as well as scores besides them, gave instruction to theological students and others. Dr. Porter, however, so says his biographer,'suffered greatly in health from superadding the labor of giving instruction to youth, and afterward to theological students.' But the education of the youth around them has always seemed to be a prime object, and a common practice among clergymen, who formerly performed the duty with much less apparent trial and distraction of mind, than the same may now be performed. This is chiefly explained, I think, by the simplicity of manners in past times. They neither gave nor expected to receive then, as much attention to mere physical comfort and convenience as they now do, and consequently there was more time, not otherwise wasted and frittered away, to be devoted to the simple object of study. But now we have no longer the plain simple red school-house, or gambrel-roofed parsonage. You must construct a large boarding-house three or four stories high, forty feet square, or mayhap fifity by seventy, with a karge wing having basement rooms throughout for various convenience of the establishment, for etc., etc., You must warm the entire edifice with furnaces, every room must be comfortable. You must have a large gymnasia and other convenient ranges of buildings. You can not lay out too much expense on your grounds, nor exhibit too much taste in your arrangements. All these require a great amount of help, and much oversight. In your school-rooms, the utmost attention must be paid to classifying the scholars, attending to their manners and progress. You must provide every accomodation, patent seats and desks. If seats are cushioned and the floors carpeted, the parents will not utter a word of complaint. Your teachers and assistants must comprise a selection of the most talented of every nation and college in the country. You must provide all the text-books, all stationary, keep an account with every pupil from three cents upward, furnishing him just as little as you can, and just as much as he wants. I have to-day been interrupted in all my studies by applications of this sort. A rap at the door of the study- 
                           "Come in! Well, Amos, what now? 
                           
                              "Amos. A note, sir, from the teacher. 
                           "Cast. (Reads). Please send by Amos a bottle of black ink, a box of pens, and a half-dozen writing-books. W. I. M." 
                           "Again the door id opened, and two little girls come to inquire if I will let each of them have three sheets of my pretty note-paper. Presently a boy comes to buy a lead-pencil, and another to get a new inkstand. Another to borrow my Porter's Rhetorical Reader. Then comes a young miss from her teacher with a large pile of recent compositions, inquiring if I will take the trouble to select from them some that may be proper to preserve and read at examination. And besides these there are the serious disturbing causes of discipline and offense to your boarding department, you must provide incessantly, large and still increasingly large quantities of provision. It must be prepared in good order and time. Deal it out most generously. Economize if you can, but never cut any one short. Purchase no poor beef, pork, or butter. Submit to much waste, improvidence every where, and endeavour to figure up the cost in a round bill at the close. To make out your bills you need a fortnight's close attention. Put your sermons and parish all aside and go about them. Look over your teacher's items of charges. Transfer them to hour regular day-book. Put every item down. Run from your study often to inquire of the teachers about this and that inconsistency that appears in the account. Get every down, absences and agreed discounts, sundries, etc. Then post up your books. Draw off all the bills. Write letters to all the parents and guardians. Pay the postage and send them off. By and by you will receive cheeks, and notes of thanks, and kind regards, etc., Pay off your teachers. Pay up your bills. Donate your servants liberally. Fill your wife's purse. Buy you a new beaver, and if there is any thing l eft, take the first car or steam-boat and spend it in a journey to recruit yourself. 
                           "Thus it is, sir, believe me. 'Fine living,' you say. 'Very, 'I reply. If you go into it, you will do so with my experience thus far written out. I say not this to deter you. Go on, if you like it. Every man must learn for him self-experience is most highly esteemed; but from what I have hastily written, you may be able to form some opinion on the question that you proposed to me, viz., 'Is the care of the school any material addition to your other duties?" 
                           
                              In all respects, your friend, 
                              "E. CASTLEREAGH."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               In a few weeks the following answer came to hand: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              DEAR CASTLEREAGH-
                            
                           "Many, many thanks for your long epistle, in reply to mine. But for its timely arrival and instruction, I much fear that I should have involved myself in an enterprise which, in my present nervous debility and general physical prostration, would have been my ruin. The people of my parish, and of this community generally, urged me to undertake a work here similar to your own, and offered me every desirable assistance. But after reading over your letter, I at once saw the peril of the undertaking. I realized as just before me a perfect loss of all quiet in my study, and a great secular absorption of my mind, and estrangement from my parish. All the good I might hope to accomplish would be met by some corresponding civil, and indeed, another person might better accomplish the good, without the evil. So I resolutely threw away the temptation, and informed my society what the reasons were that influenced me. Most of them appreciated my motives; and now, with two hundred dollars added to my salary, I am contented to devote my whole time to the good of my affectionate and beloved people. Our citizens have now subscribed ten thousand dollars for the purpose of erecting a fine edifice for a graded school, with all the desirable modern improvements, and have secured an accomplished scholar as its Principal. After your kind letter to me, that opened my eyes on the harassing nature of the service I proposed to enter on, I shall be thankful enough if my connection with the school may diminish down to an occasional visitor, or, at most, that of a standing official, yclept, or trustee. 
                           
                              "Very truly yours, ad ternatatem,

               CHAPTER XX. 
               ABBLE, CASTLEREAGH, ANN ELIZA-A VIRGINIAN-MISS MERRICK-A LAST SKETCH. 
               WHEN the short Christmas and New Year's vacation expired, Henrietta returned, bringing her youthful and only sister with her, to pass the winder and study music, a remarkable fondness for which she had always exhibited, and as a young lady singer, was greatly admired among all her acquaintances. She was accomplished in all the branches of study common in her times, and possessed a mind singularly tranquil and well-balanced. She was not free from an ideal of life that required of her, vigorous and consecutive exertion and devotion; but the stranger would not have noticed through her pale features, so remarkably in repose, any indication of passionate enthusiasm for even her favorite study of music, much less for any other mental pursuit. Yet Abbie had nothing of languor or dullness in her nature, and in her daily attention to every duty, evinced the high qualities of industry, and perseverance, in close affinity to a correct taste, and an uncommon appreciation of every privilege. Being introduced into the family of Castlereagh, she immediately commanded the highest esteem and attachment. Herself some what retiring, she derived assistance from the easy freedom of Henrietta and her longer acquaintance at the Institute. She entered upon her musical course without any unnecessary delay, and, as regularly as the day came, devoted six hours to her practice. This was all she attempted in the way of close study. About two or three hours she devoted to reading and an occasional pencil sketch; the remainder of the day was given to exercise, conversation, and amusement. Before many weeks passed away, it was generally acknowledged that her progress in music such as to destroy all hope of rivalry; and the prize, before hand, was adjudged to her by her companions. Between her and Eleanor there sprang up a very intimate companionship; and she not unfrequently contributed an anonymous article to the "Casket," which the latter and two other young ladies, assisted by Fitz Maurice, Edger, Eaton, a fine Latin scholar among the day-pupils, and Harry Otis prepared once in two weeks for the seminary. Every one admired her graceful person and easy carriage. Castlereagh studied her pale, intellectual fore head with ever-increasing interest, and formed for her high anticipations as a scholar. He was proud of his young cousin, and especially gratified to observe in her serious and decided regard for religious and more principle. 
               It was now-mid-winter. The bleak snow storms frequently raged, and high winds whirled the snow into mountain-ridges along the road-sides and fences. But this only gave the boys of the school the keener enjoyment. They leaped from the fences, accomplishing a complete somerset in the air, into the deep snow; they laid them down with outstretched arms upon it; they rolled over; they stood on their heads; they crept into it; they made them houses and forts. They fought, conquered, plundered-were then in their turn routed, and led away to prison. They coasted down long and steep hills; they harnessed themselves to sleds, and drew each other, especially rattling away at great speed with little Hobbie or Johnnie on the sled. With glowing cheeks and panting lungs, and sportive eyes, they then came rushing through showers of snow-balls to the school-room, when the ever-thoughtful bell cried out them: 
                      
                        "Run! run! run! 
                        Mr. Idem has come; 
                        That compund of fun, 
                        Worthy Worthington. 
                        How blithe he can tongue- 
                        
                           'Eorundem! Eorundem! Earundem!' 
                        Well done, well done; 
                        Now!-Run, r-u-n! r-u-n!! r-u-n!!!" 
                     
                  
                
               Who is Mr. Idem?-who but out friend, Worthington, Ide-M-arshall? The winter term brings along with it much sport in the snow, and much inconvenience, many a cough. Snow and wet in the halls, ice on the windows, and doors, deep mud along the streets and walks as the snow dissolves and the rains fall, cold rooms, shivering limbs, stampting feet, blue lips, and chattering teeth. 
               By and by the last days of February come. And then March. The days and nights are equal; spring is near, and yet winter often lingers into April, coming back suddenly with a foot of snow upon the newly spaded garden, and otherwhelming the sweet spring robins with his fierce storms. 
               Many are the sleigh-rides, as winter yet lingers, that the bright moon witnesses. And many are the carriage drives by "Express" and other notable steeds that Marshall projects and accomplishes, now with this lady of the family, and now with that, when the snow is dissolved from the streets. Castlereagh's own younger sister, Ann Eliza, passes the winter at the seminary in the capacity of an assistant in music. She is of a jovial temper, witty, wary, playful; and Marshall rambles away often with her a long distance on foot, or they ride together merrily chatting out the evening hours, or they almost devour each other with hostile political assults. Castlereagh hardly knows what view to take of such definitive attentions. He is at length persuaded that it may be wise to take no view of them but friendship's. Yet he would advise Ann Eliza jost less-to make less mirth over a matter so important as a real gentlemen's attentions. In fact, Castlereagh has a great regard for Mr. Idem, and himself would not object to calling him brother. He fancies, however, that sister Ann Eliza has never thought his thought, and keeps wondering at it. By and by he imagines that Henrietta herself has thrown over him the silken cord, and that the bird is hers. Anon, that the gentle Abbie has shot the love's arrow to his heart, and wounded him to death! Stranger still, that she who always vexes him in his politics, and compels him to wait on her when he can not well spare the time or money, the studious Eleanor, has won his idolatry. Be these as they may. One evening, unexpectedly dark, she accompanied Marshall in a carriage to the city, to hear the celebrated Mr. -- deliver a lecture in the public hall. Returning home at a moderate rate, in the very great gloom that prevailed, suddenly the wheels of the carriage interlocked with another driving in the opposite direction, and, immediately, horses, wheels, and shafts, were broken or released, and our two friends, and the persons with the other vehicle, came near being hurled to the ground. This was an unexpected and woeful dilemma to be in; but, at length, the party were able to reach home by another conveyance. Many a good jest this furnished the young ladies at Marshall's expense, who never failed to attribute their escape from a more serious accident to the excellent qualities of the horse, "who," he said "moved at a slow and wary step through the darksome street." Castlereagh was not taken into the secret at all, Marshall affirming that it was a very slight affair, unworthy to be added to his burdens of care and vaxation. He at length made the discovery of the secret, and Marshall did not hear the last of it, certainly till spring. "Bless my stars!" said Ann Eliza; "what an awful occurrence. How ought I to be glad that I was not there!" 
               "Sure enough!" responded Henritta-"What should I have done?" 
               "Our stars were indeed favorable," said Abbie; "we can not be too grateful." 
               No, nor was Eleanor; for the occurrence led her to see, in the real alarm for her safety, and anxiety that he displayed on her account, the true feelings of his heart toward her. She did not say so, but, in reality, "blessed her stars" that she was there to feel, beating for her, a heart she had long known as the home of every generous and noble sentiment, and to enjoy the after-memory of the condidence his words awoke in her own heart, when he spoke calmly to her, saying, "You need not fear, no one seems to be injured in either carriage, and we shall be able soon to resume our ride." 
               One day, when at dinner, Castlereagh was called into the parlor to see a gentlemen who had at that moment made his appearence. Entering the room, the gentlemen, who appeared about thirty-five years of age, of medium size, rather slightly made, with a somewhat languid expression, rose to meet and salute him. He was neither very graceful nor awkward, but quite self-assured, and immediately began a conversation, which ran as follows:- 
                
                  Stranger. 
                  You have a school here? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I have, sir. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  You take pupils into your family? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Yes, sir; we have a few boarding-pupils. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  So I suppose. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Yes? 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Can you accommodate another? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  We might, perhaps, although our rooms are nearly, or quite occupied. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  I am from Virginia, sir; and have come to the North on this matter. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Quite a distance from home to place a child, my dear sir. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  It is indeed. I never was so far from home before, my self. What are your conditions? 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  The price of admission? 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Yes. I suppose so. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Two hundred dollars a year, without extra studies. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  I don't want any extras, as I know of; but plain learning. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Is your child a son or a daughter? 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  
                     (Who looked up rather wild and disconcerted.) You mistake, sir, perhaps. It is I who wish to come to your school. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  
                     (Who now was disconcerted in his turn.) Ah! excuse me, sir; I thought-ah, very well, sir; rather larger than most of my pupils-and, excuse me, I was certainly impressed with the idea that you were older than you probably are. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  No consequence, sir. I am eighteen." 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Eighteen! good sir! excuse me; you Southern gentlemen sometimes have an older look than really belongs to you. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Well, I have, I s'pose got browned up some, tending the nigurs. The old gentleman has kept me at it for these four or five years, and now says I must go and learn something else, though nigur-tending is enough for a man if he has a little learning. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Then you have not been much at school of late, sir? 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Never went at all. I have helped the old man take care of the plantation and nigurs, and, like other boys around us, have learned what I know from hearing folks converse; and from my mother, who is now dead some four years. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  I take it you have a tolerable knowledge of reading, arithmetic, geography, and so forth. 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Well, I have a little, though. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  You can read? 
                
                
                  Stranger. 
                  Oh, yes-slowly. 
                
               Castlereagh looked at the young man with feelings he had never before experienced. Here was the son of a rich Southern planter, who, after the death of a good mother, had been, till he was eighteen or twenty years of age, employed in the care of negroes, to the utter neglect of his education-one who, if he could even read and write, hardly knew enough of either to affirm it, and now, alone, had come among strangers to repair this ruin of his nature, by a course of study which at the first must place him, though a man grown, in the A B C itself of the Seminary. Castlereagh asked him if he had letters of introduction. He answered, "Yes, he believed so, in his trunks, but he cared little for them, as he had the cash, and supposed that would be better than any letters he could bring." 
               Castlereagh declined receiving him as a boarder, but procured him an excellent place in another family, where he could study with less interruption than among his own boarding-scholars, who were all far in advance of him, and he was received into the Seminary. On the second day, however, he came with a rueful countenance to Castlereagh, saying that he did n't like the confinement of a school-room, and believed he should return to Virginia. He left, accordingly, and Castlereagh never saw him afterward. 
               Distant from Lindendale a long, weary travel, is the beautiful town of S--. There, in a darkened room, where, with careful tread, as with muffled feet, parents, brothers and sisters move, and hardly breathe, and speak by signs and in softest voices, a pale, emaciated, yet calm and hopeful Christian sufferer goes to her rest. The sunny morning of her life has hardly passed, yet is she called away. A father, whose gray hairs give him a venerable aspect-whose fond and confiding child she is-bows over her pillow, and takes it hard that she must be removed forever from his sight, and the endearing love that he has cherished for her; that so much goodness, mildness, gentleness and affection must needs be obscured, just when the brightness thereof began, with its sweet and lovely radiance, to illumine home, and to fill every heart with love. But she has words-few, faint, and hard to utter-which she speaks for his comfort. And she says to him, "Father, weep not. I am going before you but a short time. We will meet again. I wait for you in the bright world of glory. I shall be there; thou and these, here. We are not far off the one from the other. No, no, no-nor can be. I am sad to leave you weeping. But there is no real choice left me. My heart is all with Christ. If I had a thousand hearts, I could but give them to my Saviour. Father, mother, sisters, brothers, farewell-farewell-farewell!". Then fainting, it was long ere they succeeded in reviving her. She slept a little, and awoke. Still she was near her end. 
               "Mother-Rosetta," said she, "you hold me in your hands and arms. Let me die close to your hearts, that you may always think of me-that I may think of you, the last earthly friends I wish to forget, when I cast off this mortal and perishable mold. Sister?" 
               "What, my dear?" inquired she. 
                
               "You know my love for the dear Castlereaghs, especially for Mrs. Castlereagh, that I loved and prized her dearly-next even to yourself and mother, dear. Take then the fragment of a letter, which I began to writ to her in January last, and have never finished. Send it, with my dearest love-my last, long, eternal love to her. Will you, dear?" 
               "I will. Oh, sister, yes, yes-every thing. But would that you need not leave us. How can we live alone-without you?" 
               "Dear sister, I shall not be far away. I hope to be near you till we all get over the dark river. I love you-even in my death hour; and thus I throw my arms in one more affectionate embrace around you." And the sisters wept. 
               When the evening came, she died. This was the early death of the reader's friend and old acqauintance, Miss Merrick. Not a purer heart ever beat in humankind than hers. She was gentle and calm, yet firm; she was judicious, yet sympathetic; she was affectionate without being simple or weak. He principles were studied out of the example and gospel of Christ, her commonest pursuits being a constant preparation for her departure hence; so that for her to live was Christ, to die was gain. 
               When the news came to Lindendale, the shole family were convulsed with grief. Castlereagh wrung his hands in anguish of mind, packing his room, and exclaiming, "Would that the kind angel had but sent one precious lock, or word of personal remembrance to me! She could not have known how deeply in my heart I prized her-how it has been ever my highest wish to serve her. And now she has pined away-and died, and I have known it not-I, who would have gone to her bedside to have kneeled down and blessed her, and hear her voice, and pray for her gentle release;-gone, gone, gone is she, and we shall meet no more below." 
               Castlereagh and Sarah Matilda mourned over her departure long and sadly. for she was endeared to them even as a sister. When Castlereagh mentioned the circumstances on the following morning to the school, many an eye was filled with tears, and some of her old pupils buried their faces in their handkerchiefs, and sobbed aloud. They believed, every one of them, however. that she had fone to an eternal rest, to be forever with the Saviour, whom she loved. and whom, when on earth, she honored by her consistent, blameless conversation and example. 
               Who should come out from the city the very next day but Gustavus? He came to take tea, and walk back to his room after dark. The sad news of the previous day, when communicated to him, deeply saddened his mind. He recalled their common duties in the school when residing at the Institute, the many agreeable walks they had taken together, her confidence, her goodness, her truth, and mourned over her with sincere grief. "And yet," said he, "it is a glorious and a thrice-desirable release. I would not offer, were it in my power, a bribe to Death, to restore her to us. She is far too happy in heaven to incite even a wish in us that she might again become an inhabitant of earth, sin-stricken and perishable as it is. My grief is all allayed as I think of her unspeakable reward in the kingdom of God above." 
               These remarks, so appropriately offered by Gustavus, had their immediate and desirable effect even on the mind of Castlereagh himself, who from this moment took the consolatory Christian view of this unexpected event, and found if capable of diffusing an unspeakable calmness and resignation over his entire being, although it was in his heart long time to mourn the early death of Miss Ellen Irving Merrick.
                     MARY JOSEPHINE MASON, called "Miss Merrick" in these pages, was a native of Southbridge, Mass., a pupil of the celebrated and now sainted Mary Lyon, niece to the Hon. L-- C--s of Lowell, and her character has not been too highly sketched here.
                  
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               EXCURSION UP THE MOUNTAIN-THE CAVE. 
               HENRIETTA Ann Eliza, Gertrude, Abbie, Eleanor, accompanied by Castlereagh, Marshall, and two or three of the younger boys, including Johnnie and Hobbie, availed themselves of a bright Wednesday afternoon early in April, the snow having disappeared, and the school being over for the day, to climb the Rock. They ascended by the Seminary path. Finding itgreatly obstructed here and there by large broken rocks and fallen branches of trees, Castlereagh's first thought was that the winter's storm had broken down the trees, and the combined frost and heat had loosened the rock. 
               "What in the world does this all mean?" he at length inquired. "It is almost impossible for our ladies to climb up here. Why, Marshall, I had no idea of finding our excellent path in such a condition after the winter." 
               "Well, sir, I think that I can explain it," her replied; "although until now I did not know it had received so much injury. The plight in which you find it is owing to a misdemeanor of mine, I fear." 
               "Ah! How so?" 
                
               "Well, one day Erastus and myself having provided ourselves with some very stout levers, clambered up the steep sides of the mountain, and where we found a huge boulder that we could move, or a loosned fragment of a columnar projection, we threw it over, and sent it bounding, roaring, and crashing into the wilds below. And I remember that somewhere in this very neighborhood we found several large rocks that we had no great difficulty in removing, and the high excitement we enjoyed in seeing them roll down like great elephants, bounding from cliff to cliff, till they made the final plunge, and then sending up a roar that echoed like the thunders all around the base of the mountain. And we saw them frequently in their descent strike a tree of considerable size, and crush it down before them as if it had been made of clay. I think this bad state of things is really owing to our folly." 
               "That explains it," said Castlereagh. 
               "But don't remove the obstacles!" said Eleanor. 
               "No one!" said Gertrude. 
               "How shall we get up this steep place?" inquired Henrietta. "Poor Abbie, you never can climb this ridge; it is impossible!" 
               "Oh, fie! 'Retta," she replied; "I an not an invalid. I am very little lame; you shall see me go where you can." 
               "But I can't get over this great trunk of a tree. See it lies directly across an up-hill and rocky path." 
                
               "Well, there go the boys full of glee. The gentlemen will help us over somehow. There goes Gertrude laughing and shouting. Now Eleanor is borne up over the steepest place, and with a bound she is safe. Shall I try it, Mr. Castlereagh?" 
               "If you please; there-steady-spring! Away you go; and so goes Miss Henrietta-one, two, three, and away; and where, Where is Ann ELiza?" 
               "Here I am, brother!" shouted she, in a merry voice, far up the mountain, where like a bird, she had flown without path, or help, or guide. 
               Immediately Marshall scaled the rocks, and stood by her side. "Why Miss Castlereagh," said he, "how could you reach this dangerous point in safety-the least mis-step might have precipitated you down among these ragged points fifty or a hundred feet." 
               "Oh, fie, Mr. Marshall, I care not for danger, nor think of it. I have always run among the mountains and wild hills of my native town, and can climb them in perfect safety. Look here from this wild point into the valley at our feet. Is not that winding stream sweetly picturesque and delightful? See, it rushes over the rocks, and courses along at the base of the mountain, along by the dwellings and workshops, here and there expanding into glassy ponds or lakes, and then gracefully falling into a wide sheet over the dam that restrains it, winding around a rocky point, disappearing for a moment behind a clump of thick cedars, then again coming to view and shooting rapidly over its rocky channel into another deep and dark pond, to be again cast over another dam, or turned aside through a canal to whirl the machinery of a mill. Thus it flows on till escapes into the far spreading lowlands that stretch away to the Sea. I love intensely a scene so beautiful and vareigatd as the one before us; the stream, the village with its houses, and spires, and streets, and driven vehicles, and murmuring voices." 
               "It is lovely," said he; "there is nothing better unless the sea-shore, and the rolling and roaring of the waves." 
               "Oh! that is something horrible," said she. "I fancy I hear in it the wailings of doomed and drowning beings." 
               "Oh! the sea is magnificent, Miss Castlereagh! I have no fears of it, no more than of your little creeks and rivers that hurt nobody. I love the roaring of the sea-waves, and the swell of the ocean toward the shore. I would rather still round Cape Horn in a gale than in a Calm. I am never afraid of the sea or water in any shape-it is my element." 
               "I dare say you were never born to be hanged," said she, laughing. "You are the most inverterate lover of the sea that I ever knew." 
               "You love the rocks, and the picturesque in nature, because you were reared among the glorious hills of the North: I, who was born within sight of the crested sea-waves, and played with the tide-waters in my childhood's years, caught there an inspiration seawise wise that I find myself still cherishing wherever I am and whatever I may do." 
               "I think you have given for your preference and admiration a very appropriate and convincing explanation," said she; "and I have great love for the smooth sea, and for voyages to Europe and elsewhere, that are even accomplished with an approximation to danger, and the whirl of storms, but they must not be truly alarming to any body, although full of incidents." 
               "Romance, romance-fiction!" said he. "The sea is rough by nature, and his way is dark, sublime, and earnest. The very sunshine of ocean life is magnificent-you can hardly call it beautiful. The play-days on the sea are great anniversaries of the rude elements, the storm-days are the primeval brotherhood of chaos and old night-an approximation backward to the 'BEGINNING,' when the heavens and the earth were made, and Light first cast his sheen upon nature." 
               "You are eloquent, Mr. Marshall, but you really terrify me. Why, I shall never dare to sail on the ocean, even to meet with one of its bright, smiling, sunny calms, much less to encounter one of its ugly storms. No, no; I have no relish for returning any where into the neighborhood of old 'Chaos and Ancient Night.'" 
               Before Marshall could reply, a loud shout from the party far above them turned their attention, and they heard the rumbling and crashing of a rock that, in ignorance of the situation of those below, had thoughtlessly lessly been loosened and sent on its whirling and crazy mission down the mountain. Although two hundred feet above them, it would reach the point where they were in a few seconds. Marshall knew, from the course it appeared to be taking, they were in great danger. At the same instant Ann Eliza comprehended the peril they were in, and sent up a shriek that, being heard above the crashing of the falling rock, called, for the first time, the attention of Castlereagh and the whole of his party, to the danger in which they had unintentionally involved them. A wild cry of alarm from every one around him followed this discovery, and in the track of the descending ruin, reckless of his own danger, he rushed to their rescue. But Castlereagh's flight was far outran by the impetuous descent of the huge fragment, and had it not been for the presence of mind of our two friends, he had come but to see their mutilated and quivering limbs thrown far down into the rocky bed below. The shriek of Ann Eliza was followed by a spring from the point she occupied to a more elevated projection, slightly withdrawn from the pathway natural to the rushing rock, and having a sharp spur of its own at right angles with the line in which the bolt was coming. She was safe the moment she reached this projection, and grasping firmly on an overhanging branch, swung herself quite to its highest point, ten or fifteen feet higher than the table-rock which, a moment previous, she had been, as she supposed, safely occupying. Marshall, at the first, had turned to seize her in his arms and bear her from the danger, but her sudden movement prevented him, and as he hesitated for a moment, while he watched the success of her effort, the rock came so near him that he had barely time to throw himself off the ledge and alight under its shelving cover, six or eight feet below, before the huge fragment, with a bound of twenty feet, struck on the very place he had left, with a terrific crash, and in severed, angry, smoking pieces, by various routes, passed safely by him into the great basin of fallen rocks beneath. In another moment Marshall had sprung again to his feet, and climbing to where Ann Eliza had escaped, he found her pale and quivering with terror, and speechless with that intense feeling of gratitude which a surprising deliverance from great peril is well known to produce. 
               "Courage, courage!" cried he. "We are safe." 
               The next moment, and Castlereagh, wild with terror, flung himself fromt the rocks above, and caught her in his arms. 
               "We are all safe, sir-safe, wholly so," cried Marshall, observing how intense was the excitement of his friend. 
               "Tell me, sir-speak, Eliza; are you unhurt?" 
               She rolled her eyes on him with deep affection, and whispered, "Safe." 
               "Thank God!" said he. "What inconsideration in us to roll down that block of trap-rock directly upon you. Where did you stand, sir?" 
               "Right on yonder narrow shelf, where the wild beast struck his fore-feet in springing for his prey, but too late, as you see, and you can now hear his echoes rolling round the mountain, as he dies in the valley from his wounds." 
               The whole party were now gathered together, and Ann Eliza, recovered in a great measure from the shock, refused to give up the ramble or to let one of the party return home with her. 
               "I am always meeting with incidents in my life," said she, "and am prepared for them." 
               Eleanor was unusually pale and excited. Marshall offered her his arm and hand to help her along where the way was difficult. 
               "Where were you?" she inquired of him "when the rock went by. You were not on the same point with Miss Castlereagh?" 
               "No," said he; "when I saw that she was safe, I leaped on to a projection below, and crept under a shelving rock, just in time to hear it say 'WHANG, O!' directly above my head, and see it leap frantic and in vain, after me into the empty air." Eleanor grasped him more firmly by the arm: 
               "Why!" exclaimed she, "how very near!" 
               "Oh, not very; certainly not within six feet, and I positively safe." 
               "Let this be a warning to us all," said Castlereagh, when they were fairly up the mountain. "Let us be very careful hereafter never to roll stones down the rock when any one is below us; nor in any place where we can not see from the summit to the bottom, and so be sure that no one is near, and in danger of being hurt. A little thoughtless pleasure on our part, undertaking without regard to others, has come near making us all more or less miserable for life. Thus far extend, not unfrequently, actions that in themselves appear but very trifling." 
               The party now hurried on, and soon reached the very remarkable "CAVE," in a huge, riven boulder, to which early in our narrative, Fitz Maurice had conducted Sarah Matilda. 
               The reader should peruse the veritable history of this cave, by a departed worthy of a renowned college of our land, entitled "STILES'S JUDGES," if he would become impressed with its importance in the annals of the past. He will learn that at least two renowned men, judges of a foreign king who was brought to the block, once men of valor in the army of the great PROTECTOR, were sheltered in it from the storms of the heavens and the search-warrants of the Restoration. This cave, situated on the very summit of a mountain range, solitary and dreary, distant from the city-not in the pathway of ordinary life-has been visited by Scholastics of Europe and America. Students, youthful scholastici of many a class and college in the land, have paid their duty to the remarkable pile! They have climbed up its dangerous, slippery sides, and leaped its yawning vortici. Their names, with iron chisels, they have scarred deep into its unyielding sides, and on its crest, names that will long defy the power of the elements-long initialize them after they have themselves perished. Young men and maidens make the distant boulder-cave of the regicides the end of their long ramble; nor satisfied are they till, with tangled, torn, and draggled garments, they have sat down on the crazy summit. 
               Castlereagh led his young partly homeward by a north-easterly route, going down on the eastern slope of the mountain to an old forsaken stone house, with a very dreary, dilapidated look; the grounds around it overgrown with wild mountain shrubs and bushes, and looking extremely desolate and forlorn. The party were almost afraid to stop, and look into its desolate rooms, old as it was, and open to the winds and storms of heaven. It seemed more like a shelter for the mountain flocks, and a wild refuge for owls and bats than for any thing human-any being of reason, learning, name, and refinement. "And yet," said Castlereagh, as they expressed their surprise that any one ever should have occupied it, "here, in this very house, and on those very grounds at one time, a family second to almost none in this State, for pride, character, and position, had its home! Here, a learned president of yonder college, paid his addresses to the damsel who became his wife; this is the very mansion once occupied by the proud family of the HUBBARDS.
                     General John Hubbard, of Connecticut, resided in this indentical edifice, which is, at the present moment, little else than a lonely ruin, most of the walls having lately fallen.
                   Here, Stiles, the gifted President of Yale College, the learned author, the great scholar, roved among grounds, cultivated with care, where the sweetest roses bloomed, and wandered side by side, with the bright being of his heart's idolatry. Here many a gay scene has been transacted, the hospitable mansion illumined till midnight for the enjoyment of the numerous guests. Here, men on gayly caparisoned steeds, have galloped to the headquarters of their chief. Here, ladies and gentlemen have met, and dined, and danced; and distinguished savans have here assembled together, and made this very place, so mournful now, so green, and crumbled and forsaken, black with age, and rust, and moth, one of the central houses of music, poetry, and eloquence. So fades the glory of the world." 
               The party sauntered along homeward by the side of a sweet creek, on the east side of the mountain, Hobbie declaring he was not tired a bit; and by and by, reaching the village, they called at the post-office for letters, and soon reached their home. The first stars of the evening were just appearing as they crossed the threshold, and the bell was directly rung for tea. 
               Sarah Matilda pressed her two boys to her heart, and said, "I know you are very tired, children." 
               "No, mother," said Hobbie; "only a little bit." 
               "I am sort of tired, mother," said Johnnie. 
               "I know you are by your looks, my son. But perhaps a good supper will restore you." 
               "Oh! Mrs. Castlereagh," siad Henrietta, "I am very sorry that you were not with us-we have had a most interesting and delightful ramble." 
               "I am sorry that I could not go; but I have had company half the afternoon, and been very much occupied the other half. Well, young ladies, tea waits for you." 
               "Oh! can't you excuse me, Mrs. Castlereagh?" said Abbie, sinking into a chair. "It seems to me I never was so much fatigued in my life." 
               The poor girl was really suffering from exhaustion, and Henrietta expressed her fears that the walk had been too much for her. In a little time, however, the whole company were seated at the table, and the supper hour was enlivened by a recapitulation of the ramble, the events and scenes of the afternoon. Every one congratulated Ann Eliza and Marshall on their Providential escape. 
               "It was a thrilling affair," said Castlereagh to his wife. 
               "It must have been an almost fatal one," she replied. 
               "It won''t happen again in a hundred years," said Marshall. 
               "Now that it is all past," said Ann Eliza, "I certainly do wonder how I escaped. I am sure I could not a second time." 
               "If I might be allowed to use such an expression," said Marshall, "it was really very much like dodging a thunder-bolt." 
               "Yes," said Castlereagh; "it was a providential escape. Let us be thankful." 
                
               "Fader," said Hobbie, "I am a glad there ain't any more hills and mountains there is, to kill folks." 
               "It is a very good remark, my son," said he, as the table was inclined to be merry over Hobbs's smart speech. 
               "Father," says Johnnie, inquiringly; "do you think any body was ever quite killed in this way?" 
               "Well, I don't know, Johnnie, what to say. It looks rather that in some such way persons may have been struck down and killed." 
               "I know it looks 'reasonable,'" said he; "but I don't remember as I ever heard of any body-" 
               "Come putty near it to-day, any how, did n't they, fader?" says Hobbie. 
               "Very, my son-very near, indeed." 
               After prayer, an hour was spent in music. The boys and girls played a few pieces. Gertrude and Ann Eliza also played; Johnnie played a duett with his mother, who then gave the company some good songs, making her husband sing with her "The Mountain Bugle:"
                     Hewitt.

               IN two weeks the term would close. The principal examination of the year was connected with the end of this term, and the scholars were required to go over their studies carefully, and prepare themselves for the great trial. It was to continue two days; and Monday evening was also included for declamation, compositions and music, when the whole village of Lindenvale would turn out to see and hear. 
               Accordingly, the French pupils reviewed, the Latin scholars, the mathematical classes, from the highest to the lowest, the classes in astronomy, philosophy, physiology, geography, grammar, history, reading, writing, spelling-all reviewed. The pupils in drawing retouched, or hurried up their pieces; the music scholars gave more time to their practice, and prepared themselves to sing and play, with unusual effect, their favorite waltzes, schottisches, quadrilles and songs. 
                
               In the mean time, the attention of all the teachers was called for by the great amount of preparation making; and Castlereagh himself was incessantly active. In addition to his other duties, the last fortnight was especially devoted to making out the tution-bills, the careful examination of which, and transcribing to his account-book, and posting his ledger, made a fortnight's very close confinement, along with his other regular affairs. Necessarily, his sermons were laid over at this period, and he either exchanged with a brother minister, or preached an old discourse. 
               Every bill contained a stationary account, as well as the regular tuition charges. And this account, as kept by each of the teachers, often varied from a partial account kept by himself, and especially from that kept by the pupil. Not unfrequently, after a bill had been carefully made out and filed, the alterations were so many that he, as the least of two evils, tore up the original and made out a new one. His printed bills had their blank spaces completely filled, and often he was obliged to write a long list of "Sundries," independently of the regular order and spaces reserved. After going carefully over the charges as kept by the teachers and by himself, and arranging the account satisfactorily to himself, as a final thing he went round with bills, paper and pencil among all the scholars, inquiring if they had received any other books, paper, pencils, pens, and so forth, were charged. The first answer invariably was, "None, sir," but very often, a sober, second thought brought to remembrance something not in the bill. 
                
                  Pupil. 
                  Sir, I believe you have not charged me with my "Physiology." 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  No! There's a dollar. 
                
                
                  2nd Pupil. 
                  You have made a mistake in my bill, I think, sir. Did I not pay you for my "Day's Algebra?" 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Indeed! did you? 
                
                
                  2nd Pupil. 
                  I am sure I did. Father gave me the money. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Well, then, it's a mistake. I'll deduct it from the books. 
                
                
                  3d Pupil. 
                  I owe you, I believe, for my "Geography of the Heavens." 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Do, eh? 
                
                
                  3d Pupil. 
                  Yes, sir. Father had n't the money then, nor has he it to-day. 
                
                
                  Cast. 
                  Well, there's a dollar and twenty-five cents. I'll put it in the bill. 
                
               Thus erasing and adding items to the bills, on the whole securing a few dollars to the relief of the sinking fund for the department of books and stationery, Castlereagh went to every pupil, and making assurance doubly sure, put the final touch to his bills, and said, "All done." Still, it not unfrequently happened, that a "conclusion" and a "finally" were added to these supposed endings. In the course of his "experience" in the business of teaching, he adopted several different methods of avoiding, or at least lightening, this labor. At one time he required the pupils to furnish their own books; but they were always dilatory about it, and procured different editions of the same authors, and different authors of the same studies, to a confusion always worse confounded. Then he loaned them books, charging so much a term; but the books were generally torn up, or soon lost, and complaints made against the high charges that necessarily followed this great waste. Again he furnished the books at a slight per cent advance, but this run him into debt. Anon he required all books should be paid on delivery; but, in practice, found it was very much like a cash store, with abundant credit, after all. 
               The bills were at length made out, and forwarded in sealed envelops-some going to a great distance, by mail; others by the hands of the pupils to their respective homes. The last two days of the term were generally paying days. Castlereagh had his wallet and portmonnaie stuffed and wadded with bank-bills, and a generous handful of silver and copper loose in his pocket. He never felt richer than then, nor more despised "hard times" and bad fortune. Never felt more generous-never thought so little of the scarcity of money-was willing to deduct any amount from any one's bill-make any generous donation asked of him-fee the boys for this, and fee them for that. These pay-days were flush days with him, and the only care he seemed to have was for a larger wallet! And when the "flush days" were over, came the pay-out days, which never failed to reduce the wallet somewhere to its original dimensions, and so the old pocket-books were retained. The hard-worked teachers now had their flush days-so had the grocers, the butchers, the booksellers, the dry-goods sellers, the "help," the bakers, et id omne genus. And the old debts being paid up, Castlereagh began to see the slippery and evanescent nature of "riches." 
               Saturday previous to the examination was entirely devoted by all the teachers, and by the majority of the school-boys and girls to ornamenting with evergreens the school-rooms. The boys separated into clans, and roving through the woods, gathered cedars, running pine, hemlock boughs, and ivy, which they brought in large quantities to the rooms. The girls and young ladies with never ceasing industry, wound it together, and with the assistance of the young gentleman wreathed the windows, and the columns that supported the ceiling, and hung it in graceful arches from point to point around and across the two large rooms of the seminary, the great doors of which swung wide apart for the public examination. 
               Never was there a better examination than that of the Institute on the following Monday, day and evening, and Tuesday; Castlereagh and all his teachers were proud of their pupils. It gratified them to see collected a large number of the parents, who came in some instances from the neighboring towns to witness the close of the term, and with their own eyes notice the imporvement of their children. 
               The house was on Monday evening literally crammed. There was hardly room for the readers, declaimers, and musicians. But finally all made their appearance, and with very few exceptions the parts assigned were sustained in the most admirable manner. 
               When Fitz Maurice spoke his original Latin oration, though few understood the language, yet every body seemed pleased, and many protested that it was "good," "very fine," "capital," and as plain to them as "English." There were some, however, who did not seem exactly to understand it, nor whether they were expected to weep or laugh. Hayden in the coolest manner conceivable, with very fine effect upon his audience, spoke an exceedingly comical piece, and Harry Otis an English oration that every body listened to with perfect admiration. Edger Eaton's oration was highly applauded, and so was a dialogue that followed, spoken by Carlos and Wayne. The compositions were some of them very beautiful, and much to the credit of the writers, most of whom were the young ladies. The young music pupils followed and played, some of them, tolerably well, others showed a good deal of taste and a fine execution. The last of these who was called and now came forward was Abbie; she looked pale and deeply anxious, Castlereagh studied her countenance as she came forward, and a fearful presentiment shot through his heart respecting her. She was evidently in poor health, and it was with difficulty that she now walked erect and firm without betraying a lameness that was rapidly increasing upon her. She, however, sat down to the instrument, and sweeping her hands over the keys, every ear was opened, every breath almost suspended as she sung the touching, yet simple song, 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "TAKE ME HOME TO DIE.
                                 Woodbury.
                              
                            
                            
                              "This land is very bright, mother, 
                              The flowers are very fair, 
                              There's magic in the orange groves, 
                              And fragrance in the air; 
                              But take me to my dear old home, 
                              Where the brook goes babbling by, 
                              Let us go back again, mother! 
                              Oh! take me home to die. 
                            
                            
                              Let my father's hand but rest, mother, 
                              In blessings on my head; 
                              Let my brothers and my sister dear, 
                              But throng around my bed; 
                              Oh! let me feel that loved ones near 
                              Receive my parting breath, 
                              When I bid you all good night, mother, 
                              And sleep the sleep of death" 
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               There was a subdued, gentle, truthful earnestness in her manner, which more than the song even enlisted the attention of the audience. She finished it, and immediately rising, left the piano, while, whether in good taste or otherwise, the gratified assemblage, now breathing freely, showered on her the most rapturous favor. But Castlereagh wept. His heart was bleeding at every pore. He gazed after her, and thought as she glided away, that an ominous shadow encircled her fair form, and enviously vailed it from his sight forever. Long-long-after it he would say, "Poor, poor Abbie! 'Take me home to die.'" 
               A few rich songs from Sarah Matilda, a schottisch, a waltz, from Ann Eliza and Gertrude, a speech from the Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling, and a few closing remarks by Castlereagh, closed the gala affair. For ten or fifteen minutes the cheerful wild-ringing bell of the Institute sent its rapidly whirling vibrations along the bright circling atmospheric line of this rare night at Lindenvale, as away in every conceivable form of ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and we know not what, the people, young and old, went chatting and humming to their homes. 
               It was near morning ere the excited Castlereagh became calm and slept. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               CASTLEREAGH, JADED, WORKS ON-THE PORTORICO LAD. 
               A VACATION of three weeks is at best soon gone, as every teacher will bear us witness. It was short, and if sweet at Castlereagh's, often a bitter-sweet. There was work to be done in the Institute, painting, re-arranging seats and desks, white-washing, menidng carpets, cleansing rooms, a general overturning of the paraphernalia of the dormitories, stove and furnace cleaning, scrubbing. The grounds must be newly brushed, raked, and dressed, the fences repaired, and ornamental. Then the neglected parish-calls press on your attention. You call on Mr. and Mrs. A; you pass rapidly through a visit to the B's and B's; apologize to the D's; drop in at the E's; inquire particularly at the F's; chat an hour with the G's; sympathize with the H's; congratulate the I's; take tea with the J's; dine at K's; ride out with the L's; blunder into company at the M's; get reproved at the N's; hold meetings at the O's; give advice to the P's; write against Q's; take a long walk for the R's; have a nice time with the S's; write in Albums at the T's; funeral at the U's; bad news for the V's; warmly received at the W's; prayer at the X's; concerned for the Y's; and write an epitaph at the Z's. 
               The work of a quarter is attempted in three weeks, besides the forestalling of work to come during the next three months; and the pastor's time is all parceled out, morning, noon, evening, night, and used up several times over. Sermons must, of course, be written during the lazy time of vacation. He receives more calls then, as well as makes them, for he is, of course, at leisure!! Poor, jaded Castlereagh! 
               Castlereagh is sick. 
               Castlereagh is nervous. 
               Castlereagh is worn out. 
               Castlereagh has a cough. 
               "Castlereagh, Castlereagh! You are sick." 
               "I am." 
               He suffered a cold to fasten on him during the spring, that became a serious affair before he saw the last effects of it. 
               But the term begins again, and lively boys and girls, and pressing duties force him to be active, though weary, faint, and indisposed to any exertion. The enervating spring annoys him, the cough depresses him, and yet you see him refusing to yield, and attempting all that he has ever before done-and even more. He plans a wider system for his school. He will build larger, improve his grounds, enlarge his corps of teachers, append the Normal element, introduce the Dunton penmanship, and raise the standard of education as far as possible in each department of study. 
               ABBLE did not return. The other young ladies came back. Gay and mirthful Isabel, the loving Stella, the placid Roxana, Eleanor, Ann Eliza, Miss Henrietta. The latter came back with a sigh, for her sweet sister, Abbie, was evidently drooping and paler growing, and suffering daily. 
               There were some new boys from the city and elsewhere in the school as day scholars or in the family, especially there came a lovely boy from Porto-Rico, in charge of his New York friends. His parents were native-born Americans, but the lad was Spanish born, and more or less familiar with the language. He had, however, been two years in the United States when he came to Lindenvale, and had forgotten most of the words, or, if not forgotten, he would never speak the language. S-- was one of the sweetest lads in the universe. Castlereagh loved him intensely, and at the table his seat was immediately at his right-not the best seat to be waited on first, but an honorable one, and familiar. He was a small lad, and but ten years of age, with flaxen curls and hazel eyes, and cuban expression. A sweet smile expressed the joyous innocence of his nature; a simple truthful language, his love of virtue; a free bestowment of his choice presents ents from the Islands, his generous heart; constancy and progress in his studies, his native mental endowment; and his activity and love of sports, his excellent physical constituation. He was a child to be loved for his amiable and attractive nature; whom to love was neither idolatry nor wastefulness, for he deserved and repaid it all. 
               Between Castlereagh and his father, D-- H--, Esq., there grew up in a short time a very pleasing correspondence. Sarah Matilda and Mrs. H-- also wrote to one another; the subject-matter of their correspondence being, on the one part, the expression of a mother's love for her darling, absent son, and on the other, in the most earnest and friendly manner, recounting the story of his daily life, and assuring the far-distant mother that he had found hearts tender and true in their love toward her darling one. 
               S-- one day received a letter from his friends in New York, inclosing another from his father, informing him that a vessel from the island had arrived in that port, and would soon reach her harbor near Lindenvale, having on board for him several packages of fruits and choice things, such as absent sons and school-boys love. S-- betrayed no great excitement or emotion at these tidings, having all his life had oranges growing in his sight, and within his reach in his father's grounds, and being perfectly familiar with the taste and abundance of good things that the soil and climate of Cuba produce. But to the other boys and girls, reared in the north, to whom these fruits and delicacies of a tropical clime were special, dear-bought luxuries, the announcement of such an arrival to the care and disposal of one so generous as S--, produced a flutter of excitement, and a nervous lookingfor of the well-laden trucks, that quite indisposed some of them to hard study or common enjoyments. At length the truckman came, his stout and noble horse sweating and snorting under his heavy draught. It happened that the arrival took place just at twelve, noon, when the boys were flocking from school, and they gathered in wild and expectant groups around the discharging cargo. S-- was the only one of them who did not bound with delight. He calmly whittled a pine stick, and seemed particularly pleased to see the other scholars in their excitement, and to listen to their facetious jokes. Never had a boy, under any circumstances, more friends than he now had. You coulds see this one and that one slyly courting his favor, and doing little kindnesses for him. 
               "S-- knows me," says Harry Otis. "He and I are al'ays gude friends, ye know, sonie. Eh?" 
               "Did n't I," say little Hartwell Briggs, "find your ball, hey?" 
               "Did ye, though?" says Hayden. "And what was that to the flogging I gave that fellow, the other day, for stealing his penknife? Recollect it, don't ye, S-r?" 
               "To be sure," says the lion-boy of the occasion. 
                
               "Well," says Johnnie, "S-- and I sit together, don't we, S--? 
               "I tell you what it is," says Fitz Maurice. "S-- shall ring the bell to-day just as much as he wants to, and nobody shall prevent him-eh, S--?" 
               "Good! good!" says S--; for the ringing of the bell was often solicited. 
               "Well," says Amos; "I tell you what S--, you shall ride on my back all round the seminary to-morrow; and I'll climb the old liberty-pole with you on my shoulders; and we'll eat the oranges, won't we, up at the cross-tree?" 
               "Ha! ha! ha! ha!!" shouted the boys. 
               "S-- shall sit with us," cried Stella and Roxana, from the veranda, "this whole evening in the parlor, and we'll tell him the finest stories he ever did hear." 
               Of course, his confiding and affectionate COUSIN Isabel felt perfectly sure of her share of the spoils. 
               "I'll pin his collars on for him, 'good,'" says Gertrude, from the window. 
               "And S-- knows who gets his hard sums out for him;" says Eleanor. 
               Poor S-- kept on whittling and smiling, and the truckman unloading. There was one large tierce of oranges; one barrel of beautiful syrup; one large package of pine-apples; a large parcel of sugar-cane, bananas, pumpkins, casks of yams and sweet potatoes. A very fine present, enough for all, and S--'s letters told him to be sure and share his good things with his schoolmates. 
               Every boy in school was now given up to the work of eating sugar-cane, pine-apples, bananas, and oranges. Each one carried an orange in his hand, which he was fast reducing in size, and another, as large as could be safely ensconced there, in his pocket. The favorite and pretty girls were loaded with presents. Orange peel, whittlings and crunchings of cane, rejected bananas, were cast in all directions over the grounds; and a happy carnival had the school. S-- was every body's boy, and the generous nature of the lad had full scope for its widest exercise. Yet he used some discrimination and firmness in parceling out his tropical treasures. He had his intimate friends and his mere acquaintances. Half a dozen oranges were none too many for a beloved cheek-by-jowl companion; while another, less intimate and agreeable, received but one or two. The little girl that stole smiles from him had the largest orange you ever saw tossed into her two hands-and that not once-nor twice. Mr. Castlereagh was presented with a large fruit-basket overflowing with the good things, and all the teachers were generously remembered. As for the barrel of syrup it was rolled into the cellar, and was served up on hot cakes at breakfast.
                     D. H. Esq.-Dear Sir: I am still using that cask of syrup! It seems exhaustless as the widow's cruse of oil, yet we suppose it must fail by the by. Yours, C.--, 1855-6.
                  
                
                
               The kind and interesting letters that accompanied the presents were not the least agreeable part of the freight. And Castlereagh received with his a most valuable parcel in the shape of a specimen of a choice plant, that is found but in one place in the whole island, and is rare the world over, called the doradilla plant, of the family of ferns. Mr. H-- assured him that one part of the parcel sent on had been preserved three years, and the remainder for a considerable period; and that it possessed, although apparently wholly decayed and dead, the property of reviving its life by inserting the slips in water for a few hours. Castlereagh was delighted to find his experiments successful in this particular. A green life-like fern-stalk greeted his eye in the morning, shooting up out of the glass where he had placed a dried, and, apparently, dead slip of the doradilla the evening previous. Mr. H-- was of opinion that there was the same recuperative energy in the root of the plant; an experiment which Castlereagh intended, sooner or later, to try for his own gratification. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               JOURNAL, IN WHICH LIFE'S DRAMA THICKENS-THE SMOKERS-NORWALK. 
               JOURNAL. May 1.-I have issued a new circular. It is printed on one page of a letter-sheet, and two pages are reserved for correspondence. It cost me considerable thought to arrange the form. As it is, the caption reads-"LINDENVALE INSTITUTE-FOR BOTH SEXES." Then, in a single paragraph, there is a statement of the situation and privileges of the Seminary. The teachers are named in both departments. The studies, the tuition, books and stationery, rules and terms of study, have their separate paragraphs. Then the names of the patrons of the school are paraded, being picked up here and there over the whole continent. Then follows a printed notice of the pupil's progress, which is forwarded to parents or guardians from time to time, the blanks being filled out- 
               "All communications should be addressed to Reverend Elbert Castlereagh, Pastor of the church in Lindenvale," etc., etc. This seems to look very business-like. What a great privilege it is to quote among your patrons, the great men of the country? I think that those poor teachers who have no such opportunity must meet with many embarrassments and much discouragement in their labor! But it really seems that very few do find themselves in such a dilemma, for I have noticed this very day, in one of my newspapers, some four or five advertisements of schools, all of them "taking the liberty to refer" to distinguished scholastics, and honorable men in colleges and elsewhere throughout the land. And one thing more-I have felt some concern of mind for those venerable men who are so often mentioned as the sponsors and god-parents of these baby-institutions, and who, the public are assured, will give the necessary "characters," satisfactory to the most fastidious guardians of children-lest, in fulfilling their guranties, they should finally run themselves out of complimentary terms, or get confused in the use of them so as to underrate one and overrate another, when the most serious consequences might be supposed, sooner or later, to arise. A very great responsibility, surely, connects with such an elevation in the public eye, as that of a learned man, a wise and judicious man, who knows all about the character, and fitness for his work, of Mr. A. B., and of Miss C. D. for hers, and of every body else, over the unreasonable limits of all the North American continent, and who gives his very distinguished name to recommend institutions, inside of which he never entered, a circular of which he never saw, and the course of which he knows little or nothing. So much for theory ory. But the credit system is fashionable, and it is therefore hard to break up. 
               
                  May 2.-I am sorry to hear the discouraging news that Cousin ABBIE is quite ill; that, after she reached home from school, she went abroad but once ere her lameness so increased upon her as to confine her within doors, and that the attack does not yield to the remedies employed. Instead of the rheumatism, the family are apprehensive of that terrible and often fatal disorder, called the "hip complaint." Henrietta is anxious, I notice; and every letter seems to discover still more her apprehensions. She is unwilling to leave me if she can remain through the term, but I know that her heart is with her mother and precious, only sister. 
               
                  May 3.-Somewhat unwell, I have just finished a beautiful ground-plan of a cottage; it is a gem-perfectly exquisite! Have been at work in my garden. I must make a rule against the boys leaping the garden-fence after foot-ball. They bound over it into my raspberry and currant-bushes, head first, like openmouthed hounds in chase of game. Already my pieplants have been trodden down and crushed so as very nearly to destroy them. My asparagus-bed has been trampled down, and a young and thrify Catawba grape wholly ruined. 
               "Boys! BOYS!! what are you doing there-leaping upon my vines and bushes so carelessly? You will ruin every thing. Go through the gate, go through the gate." 
                
               But it is hardly supposable that forty or fifty lads, with blood up for a game at foot-ball, can be induced to forego the excitement, and risk the chance of defeat in their sport, long enough to swing open a gate! I must do something about this. There comes the India-rubber foot-ball again. Dyke Silliman has hit it, and it is twenty or thirty feet in the air. It flies over the fence-it alights-crash! It has broken through the glass into my hotbed. 
               "Boys! boys! BOYS! this will not do." 
               "Beg your pardon, sir. It was a great mistake. We will do so no more." 
               "Ah, boys! you are good to promise, and are very frank, and very hopeful-I only fear your temptations." 
               Little Hobbie sometimes gets off a good thing: 
               "How many promises dere are and not do; ain't dere, fader?" 
               "How so?" 
               "Why, the boys promise, and promise, and promise, ever so many times, you know, dey will certain do so as you say, and den dey go right away and not do." 
               Hobbie sees where the bad is, evidently. But, after all-it's no mitigation, though-boys do but follow out the example of men. Mr. A. promises that your house shall be built by the first of September, and completes it the last of November. Mr. B. promises to vote for a stringent temperance law in the Assembly, but goes with his party against it. Mr. C. will write you letters of introduction to some friend of his on business of importance to you, but forgets it. Mrs. D. will be most happy to call on you, with her refined and polished daughters, but fails of keeping her promise. "How many promises dere are and NOT DO," says Hobbie. After all, one of the best promise-keepers we have is the Locomotive. Governed by a positive rule, it heads away against wind, tempest, and darkness, smashing up his fellow-locomotive rather than losing his promise, and dashing into snow-banks with the fury of a white bear, never giving up until an uncompromising necessity obliges it, and then struggling to the last. 
               
                  May 5.-Received the following characteristic letter to-day from my old friend Artaxerxes Sunderland.

               This man Artaxerxes, under a very rough exterior, has one of the warmest and best natures in the world. I have never been sorry that I took charge of Amos, for he is really a very intelligent boy, and would take a high stand in college were he to enter it. Still, I do not think it best to send all our smart boys to college. 
               
                  May 5.-Alice writes me that she is going to New York to attend the Anniversaries. I have thought of going down myself. To-day, I was much overcome by hearing from Marshall that some of my best boys in the Institute were covertly acquiring the monstrously evil habit of smoking cigars and chewing tobacco. After reflecting sadly on this intelligence for a few moments ments, and imploring the Divine assistance, I walked into the seminary, and called to me the offenders-Harry Otis, Hayden, and Williams. 
               We were quite by ourselves and without any interruption. Hardly knowing in what manner to address them, yet fully convinced of my duty to do so for their own sakes, and their parents', and my own, and the good of the school-I inquired of them the truth of the report. They admitted it, with apparent confusion, and some hesitation, and with explanatory and mitigating circumstances. "But, my dear boys," said I, "it will hardly admit of these mitigating explanations; the evils of smoking and chewing are too great and too well known to be so lightly palliated; and you know how offensive the habit is to your parents and to myself. You know it is contrary to all the rules of the school, and that it would furnish me with just cause to complain of your conduct to your friends at home; nay, to suspend you from the Institute." 
               They acknowledged that the habit was a vicious one, and they did not intend to follow it, although they confessed that they could, even then, smoke the whole of a cigar, and even chew tobacco, without experiencing any nauseating effect. I inquired of them: "Where did you obtain your cigars? for you know it is against my rules that you should visit the stores to purchaes any thing without my permissions." 
               They were rather troubled to answer this, but at length said they had sometimes bought them at the toll gate, a mile or two distant, when they were rambling on the mountain. "Yes," said I, "when I have trusted to your honor, and put the utmost confidence in your requests to go and amuse yourselves with a walk, you have abused it in a manner positively surprising and wicked. Who taught you to smoke? Harry Otis and Hayden said that Williams was accustomed to it when he came to school, and they had learned it of him. I further asked them if they ever purchased cigars any where else. This troubled their young consciences somewhat; but they at last confessed that they had once or twice bought them at the hotel. 
               "Truly, boys," said I, with great astonishment, "you have been engaged in a most mean and criminal course of behavior. You see now where this habit leads you. It combines to destroy both soul and body. you have concealed from me your conduct, have betrayed my confidence, have been cutivating a vile and destructive habit in secret, have not consulted in this your own good, nor your parent's happiness; you have disregarded you example over other, and put in jeopardy the good name of the school; for where is the parent with proper and serious views of life, who wishes his little boys to acquire this habit, especially in a school where he has placed him in the confidence that his habits would be all guarded according to his highest wishes, and formed on the most correct models? You have been guilty of visiting a hotel, where the fumes of rum and tobacco mingle with shoutings and blasphemies-where you become familiar with habits of dissipation, and yourselves take the first steps in the downward road to infamy and ruin. It is not so?" 
               They assented to the truth of all I said. "Is this right?" They confessed their error. Seeing that they were humbled and ashamed, I could not refrain from weeping before them. Harry Otis and Hayden shed tears over their wayward and shameful course. I grasped their hands, and exhorted them by all they prized in the world, and all they feared in the next, to abandon, totally and forever, this ruinous course of life, the first steps in which they had already learned. They, still trembling with emotion, promised me they would do so, and hoped that I would forgive them. Williams, being older, and more assustomed to such a habit, betrayed less emotion than the others, but thoughtfully and seriously attended to all that I advanced, and declared it, as his firm determination, never again, during his connection with the Seminary, to indulge the habit, or, by his example, in any way to foster it in others. I was happy to be informed that neither Fitz Maurice, nor Amos, nor yet S--, had been guilty of this offense. 
               I have blamed Sarah Matilda a little about this, for it seems she discovered some tobacco, two or three weeks ago, in the jacket-pocket of Harry Otis, when mending it, and, again, in a drawer of his bureau. But hoping that he was above this indulgence, and intending ing herself to speak to him before disturbing my mind about it, she had let the matter slide by unnoticed, and the boys meantime were rapidly acquiring, even under our very eyes, an injurious and disgusting habit for life. How I tremble for these boys! They have long been with me, and give promise of most true and noble character. But what temptations lie in their path-and how easily they may yield to them and fall! I shall not soon forget this scene with them, nor cease to pray for their salvation. 
               Sarah Matilda is troubled almost to death with the heedlessness and the absence of a true ear on the part of many of her music pupils. Herself familiar with every note and key in music, it is annoying, when in her room, over the practice-room of the pupil, or any where else within hearing, to notice a scholar going through a piece she has long practiced, a whole octave below the proper pitch, or, what is still worse, a note or two below, sometimes commencing on a wrong key, and so playing a discordant jumble of intervals as seriously as though all were right, at which one might indulge himself in a hearty laugh if the matter were not so distressingly vexatious and discouraging, leaving out also flats and sharps and perceiving no difference, playing right with one hand and wrong with the other, discords grating on the ear like the filing of a saw. So in time. It distresses her that some of them have no time, but play slow and uncertain when the execution is difficult, and hurried and ever accelarating when it chances to be easy. She says it takes away full half the pleasure of instructing to find such inattention, and such an absence of the true appreciation of music in her pupils. But I reply to this, "'We must have the bitter with the sweet.' If they murder it now, they will repent, and do better by and by. They are learners-learners. What is awkward to-day will become more and more easy and agreeble as they proceed. They are young scholastics, and by and by they will 'drift' aright." 
               "They never will 'drift aright' in the world!" she replies. 
               "What! not by patient instruction?" 
               "NEVER." 
               She has made up her mind on this point, and when she says "NEVER," I always drop the discussion, let the point be where and what it may. As I am not very well, it has been determined that I shall go to New York this week, and so avoid the necessity of preaching on the Sabbath. I will go and call on Brother Clifford in my way, passing the Sabbath at his house. 
               
                  May 6. Truly horrible news is now pervading the city, spreading from its center to every one of its lanes and concealed abodes, as well as penetrating to the most distant parts of its suburbs. There is a general paleness and solicitude on the countenances of the people, as they run here and there-and anxiety, that will hardly be satisfied at any answer given to the inquiries put forth, be the same good or evil. At first all is rumor! Dreadful-supposable-possible-vague-flying-startling-idle-"It is, after, all"-so says the new rumor-"but an affair of the locomotive and the baggage-cars. Indeed, let us shake off the gloomy feeling and say, 'We are glad of it-the Company will be more careful next time,'" But there is another rumor; it places the matter in a different aspect, and men run hither and thither in wilder excitement than at the first. Now the deranged wires begin to speak. And-and, hark! Surely the whistle and rumbling of the delayed cars are heard. We shall all have definite reports at length, and may carry to our homes sad and bleeding heart, or feelings of gratitude above the ordinary rise of our emotions. (So abruptly ends the Journal of the 6th.) 
               Thus was the city of N-- H-- excited during the afternoon of Friday, May 6, 185-, when the train of cars due there at eleven A. M. failed to arrive, and the report was variously circulated in the course of a few hours that it had run into the open DRAW-BRIDGE at NORWALK! At first it was said that many lives were sacrificed, but this was followed by less painful news, and by and by, either from a strong wish that it might be so, or from some information obtained more or less reliable, it was circulated, and tended greatly to relieve the public suspense, that nobody was injured, although the locomotive and baggage-cars were in the draw. Brief and false reprieve. The first rumor was the truest, "MANY LIVES LOST." A medical convention tion in New York had assembled there a portion of the best talent and influence to be found in this profession throughout the country. And it happened that on this very train were a large number of the delegates returning North. Quite a proportion of the eminent physicians of the city of N-- H-- were absent attending the Convention, and it was feared they might be, as well as many other business men who return home on Saturday, on this ill-starred train. Fortunately the business men of N-- H-- return from the metropolis in one of the evening trains, and not in the morning ones. But persons going further north and east do usually take the eight o'clock express from New York, and accordingly in the Norwalk tragedy there were a great many families at the north who were made to suffer. 
               At a late hour in the afternoon, the cars came through from the scene of the disaster, bringing to anxious friends in N-- H-- much personal relief in the restoration to them unhurt of all their absent ones, although there were quite a good number on the train, and some of them were in great danger at the time of the disaster. This sad and painful accident occurred as follows: The express train that leaves New York for New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, Worcester and Boston, at eight o'clock every day but the Sabbath, was making its regular trip on Friday the 6th of May, and arrived in good time near the South Norwalk Station, forty-five miles or thereabouts from New York. From the South Norwalk Station there is a beautiful curve in the track, eastward to a long bridge which has a draw on its western extremity to let through small vessels and a steamboat. Such is the extent of the curve that from the station the bridge is not seen at all, and when past its central point, if under full headway, the train is too near the draw to be arrested, even if there is the greatest danger to be avoided. Accordingly there is a signal-globe at the draw, which being elevated on a tall staff, it is seen above the dwellings and other objects situated between, by the engineer of the train before he reaches the station and begins to traverse the curve-for this express train does not in going to the north and east, stop at Norwalk unless there is a necessity. On the present occasion, it happens that the "draw" was open to let through a steamboat for New York, and she had just cleared her length from the bridge when the accident took place. The signal-ball on the staff was "lowered" according to the rule in all cases of this kind; but the engineer, owing to some inexplicable deception of his vision, or neglect of duty, did not perceive its absence from its usual elevation, and of course held on at the same high rate of thirty miles the hour under which he had steamed up from the city. There is, we know, a motive as we drive into a city or village, or before the eye of a large company of persons, to make the team we are guiding appear to the best advantage. And to an engineer of conductor of a train of cars, which is the admiration of every body, there can hardly be supposed wanting this common motive in the action of the mighty "Iron Horse," snorting and chafing under his rein. It is thought, therefore, that the train swept by the station and toward the bridge, which was less than an hundred roads distant from the station, with a velocity equal to what had been made during the rest of the morning. The engineer, conductor, fireman and breakmen, were proud of their train, and perfectly easy and jovial. Express agents and some few of the passengers were lounging, puffing, and laughing over good stories in the smoking car. The passengers, to the number of four or five hundred, read the papers, joked with each other, clustered in little clans, looked at their watches, caught a glimpse here and there of the Sound, and believed themselves all safe. Unsound and treacherous human confidence! Fatal celerity! Once round the curve, and the danger became evident. The engineer preceived just before him the yawning chasm toward which he had so rapidly been driving his train with all his imminent, unavoidable danger. He instantly gave the alarmwhistle to the breakmen, reversed the engine, and with his fireman leaped from the devoted train. The fireman escaped without serious injury, but he was dangerously wounded. Instantly the imperceptibly checked locomotive and train of cars rushed to the plunge. The locomotive, impelled as well by the momentum of the train as by its own power, made a graceful curve to the water from the track, and sinking rapidly from view, buried itself in the deep water and slime hard up against the timbers of the pier on the other side of the draw, a distance of sixty feet; immediately in the rear of it, in a straight line, lay the two baggage-cars; above them the smoking car and first passenger car formed another tier, while the second and part of the third passenger-cars formed another. It was the work of an instant. Fifty human beings were instantly plunged into this vortex, confined in the cars, unaware of danger, and perished before they had, at least many of them, the first idea of any catastrophe. A few escaped by great exertions and singular providence from the smoking and baggage cars; but in the first and second passenger-car nearly every one was killed outright or drowned. Twenty or thirty persons were more or less wounded who escaped with life, some of whom afterward died, others entirely recovered. In the rear cars none were injured. By this dreadful calamity, the result, as it would see, of carelessness and inattention to existing rules and signals on the road, husbands, wives, parents and children were torn from each other, and communities far and near were made to suffer. The pride of many a circle of friends in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Hartford, Bridgeport, Springfield, and in many other cities and villages was taken away by this deplorable event. Fifty human beings recovered in a short time from the ruins, stretched side by side, pale, cold and dead on the shore, the wailings of relatives and friends filling the air, the groanings of the wounded and the lamentations of the people rendered the scene one that entirely baffles all description. The coldest heart was moved to pity, and eyes that seldom grew moist or warm with tears, filled and burst with grief. 
               Castlereagh was shocked to notice among the list of the wounded, the names of General H. and his lady, of New York, uncle and aunt to Sarah Matilda. He was not surprised that he was on the train, for his business led him every few days over the road. He now hurried his arrangements, and in the morning train went down to Norwalk. He found thousands of persons there before him, many assembled from excitement and curiosity, others earnestly seeking for an absent and lost friend. He followed the crowd into the various rooms and places of deposit, where the dead had been decently laid out, coffined, and numbered. It shocked and overcame him. Every face he looked on was that of a stranger; but his heart was deeply, powerfully agitated, for the stranger had his friends somewhere far or near, who would mourn for him, and a home that would now be desolate. Those "dead rooms!" 
               "Ah!" said he, "may I never never, never, see the like again; those dark, rigid faces; those cold frames; those bruised limbs and scarred features; the dead mother and child. Oh! what shudderings and oppressive emotions I experienced there; what risings of will against Providence; what sensations of terror mingling with pity induced me to hasten and flee away from the awful locality of such scenes, and endeavor to forget what had impressed itself indelibly on the heart for life." 
               It was too harrowing. Castlereagh sought the dwelling to which his friends had been removed, and was glad to learn that General H. was not much injured. They met at the threshold of the door. Their voices trembled as they grasped each other by the hand, and uttered an earnest "God be thanked." General H-- was scarred in several places, but not dangerously wounded. His wife lay on a couch, severely, and as it proved, fatally injured. She recognized Castlereagh and extended her hand to greet him as he approached her. She spoke to him and to her friends perfectly coherently, and though she was a great sufferer, her face being much bruised and swollen, she smiled on them all, and betrayed no lack of interest in their welfare. Yet the sight was a painful one to witness-the excitement of it almost too great for endurance. That she might be kept as quietly as possible, few saw her, or remained long in the room, and Castlereagh pressing her hand warmly between his, and commending her to God, left her in charge of her own affectionate children, who had already arrived from the city. In the house nearly opposite was the family of Dr. G-- of New York, whose idolized daughter, pronounced and believed to be dead, had been providentially tially restored to consciousness, through the long-continued and hopeful exertions of Mr. B-. Others of the wounded and suffering were disposed here and there among the families of the kind people of South Norwalk, and were receiving every needed attention. 
               Castlereagh with a mind overwhelmed and saddened by what he had seen, went to New York. On the following Wednesday Mrs. H-- died. She was taken back to the city, and buried at Greenwood, sincerely mourned. Her husband, General H--, recovered from his wounds, but never from the internal effects of the shock, and was suddenly removed from life within two years after the event. He now sleeps by the side of her, who with him, was a sufferer in the great and thrilling catastrophe termed 
                     "THE NORWALK TRAGEDY."
                  
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               PUNISHMENT COMMUTED-MARBLES-CASTLEREAGH IS RESTLESS-THE SWEET LITTLE SCHOLASTICA. 
               "I HAVE had a rather singular commuting of discipline to-day," said Marshall to Castlereagh, one evening in June. 
               "And pray, what was it?" 
               "Why, there is Wilder Henderson, black-eyed, curly-haired, and playful as he is, not over-fond of study, but capable of it, has been of late too neglectful. I have talked with him, and coaxed him, and threatened him, but all to no purpose. For two afternoons now, I have kept him after school, once more than an hour. This is a great punishment, you know, with him." 
               "Oh, yes, certainly," 
               Well, while thus shut up with me, his friend and companion, Henry Kingsley, waits for him, and when released they walk home a mile and a half together." 
               "Yes, I know-well?" 
               "Well, to-day, finding that he must stay after school as a punishment for poor lessons, he came to me and proposed that, as he and Henry wanted to get home as soon as possible to-night, I should give him a feruling in place of imprisonment. I took the matter into consideration therefore, and calling him aside, we soon agreed on the main points. He agreed to bear it in good-humor and not cry. I agreed to strike him on the hand three times, and that, if he persisted in the same way, by which punishment became necessary, I should increase the blows one each day. So we got ready, and I feruled him." 
               "Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed Castlereagh. 
               "Yes, sir; I put it right on." 
               "And how did he bear it?" 
               "Oh! very well, indeed. The last blow he cringed under a little, but said, 'I did it all fairly.'" 
               "Ha! ha!" 
               "After it was over, I asked Wilder how he liked it. 
               "'Oh!' said he, 'it hurt some at the time, but it is all over now; and I am glad of it, for I have saved a whole hour by it!'" 
               "Well, you did 'commute,' indeed-a singular boy Wilder, and has his peculiar ideas of improving and saving time, it seems." 
               "Decidedly, sir, and promises to make a scholar." 
               "Yes; and do you think he will have many more inflictions of this sort without coming under?" 
               "I think he will give up after one or two more. The novelty wears off, you know, after a time." 
               "True; well try him once or twice more, and see if it produces any effect." 
                
               The next day Wilder went through the same exercise, there being four instead of three blows. He could with difficulty refrain from tears, but did not betray himself. Inwardly, however, he resolved that he could not stand five, much less six similar shocks of the tender nerves of the hand, and that on the whole, it would be best to let play alone, and attend to his lessons. 
               Marshall informed Castlereagh that the feruling ended there, and Wilder was ever after one of his prompt boys. 
               Marbles are beautiful play-things. How prettily do little boys look in pictures, huddled together, and kneeling with lively and pleasant countenances over their game. Their eyes follow it with wide-awake interest, and you say: "One of the sweetest plays in the world!" So when you see boys the green, and along the side-walk playing marbles, you long to be a boy yourself, and play with them. You actually buy your pocket-full of marbles to give away. They are so smooth, so variegated in color, and so different in size, with such an intelligent nomenclature, "annies," "alies," "boulders," and "agates." And the games are so many, and so pretty, and so innocent, and yet intricate to the mere looker-on, while the boys all understand them; and "taw"
                     Webster spells it "taw," the boys pronounce it "toy," or "toi."
                   here, and "pink up" there, and "hill, "and "fire," and "span," as the game may be "Cincinnati," "Ring," or "Role-hole." 
               Yes, marbles are pretty play-things. But now, who has ever passed along the walk, and gone near where the boys were hot at marbles, without seeing and hearing things that sadly lessened his interest in this juvenile and common recreation? Have you never seen Tom and Bill in a miniature fight, on account of some alleged unfairness in the game? Have you never heard Sam and George using the most violent language to one another-"You did!"-"You did n't!"-I'll be --! if I did!"-"You don't play fair."-"You lie?" 
               Have you never heard used all the rough oaths and Billingsgate of veteran sinners and criminals by these boys at the beautiful game of marbles? Why, I DARE not even write the words that I have heard along the street, bandied from one boy to another in a ring of marble-playing, oaths, blasphemies, imprecations! So I deem it likely that marbles, though a beautiful sport, has in it some of the common fruit of the Fall. I love children and their plays. But there is forced on my mind a conviction both saddening and mortifying, when seeing and hearing the evils that I find may exist even in so simple and childlike a game as marbles, that we are in danger of sinning when we indulge ourselves in objects and pursuits that, though in themselves innocent or without any moral character, are yet extremely fascinating, and promise us the greatest innocent excitement! Castlereagh made it a rule that his pupils, though allowed to play at marbles, should never gamble with them. He said to them: "I do not keep a gaming school. I can not give you any permission to play marbles to win them one from another, and so early to cheat and injure your fellow men. You may play with marbles, but must not game." Yet, occasionally, even then, words would run high: criminations and recriminations would issue forth from their young hearts and mouths. He did not fail to call them to order for these offenses, nor to show them the evils that easily grow up from those innocent amusements we all allow ourselves. In this manner he hoped to impress on their minds a vivid sense of the subtlety of sin, and lead them to watch against temptation. Yet, he soon found that little Johnnie and Hobbie could not only play every game at marbles, but could scold, fret, and quarrel over them. Ah! marbles may be indeed a beautiful sport. But, Christian man, did you ever sell a boy marbles to play and gamble with, without becoming accessory to his after life of sin and crime? Did you ever hear boys at marbles make use of oaths-ever see them angry? And, Christian brother, did you ever send your beautiful boy into a group of children at marbles, without exposing him to temptation, and to hear bad words and witness a fight? Yet, oh, sweet marbles! How beautiful are marbles! How pretty is the game! So was Eden fair. Positively, I do not know a game that children play which is productive of so much ill-nature, and that abounds with so many high words and fierce contentions as marbles; kite-sailing, coasting on sleds, ball, quoits, "I spy," "Poison," "ring-round," "leap-frog," "haley over," house and parlor games-no one of them is productive of so much evil language and violent behavior as marbles. It is strange; I only mention the fact, for marbles is certainly a beautiful game. 
               Early in June, Henrietta came to Castlereagh with a letter, just received from home, that made it her duty to leave the school. Abbie was suffering from her complaint to a very great degree, and called earnestly for the presence of her only sister. She left the next day, and Castlereagh supplied her place with other teachers. Miss Y--, an intelligent young lady of the vicinity, succeeded Henrietta for a week or two, after which Miss N--, a thorough and interesting teacher, took care of the female department to the close of the term. Eleanor having a generous proposal to go to the South as a teacher, left Lindenvale Institute about this time. All were much grieved at her departure. Marshall, for three days, seemed entirely tongue-tied and destitute of all means of happiness. This subjecting him to some slight raillery from the young ladies, he assumed a carless, bold, jaunty air, which seemed to imply his indifference to the subject-almost his ignorance of the absence of any of the family, but which made the case neither more nor less personally painful. 
               We can not mention the "thousand and one" trials, and anxieties, and mingled cares of the life that Castlereagh was leading. There never arose a day, how bright soever it might be, that brought not with it some pressing conviction of duty, some necessity of watchfulness, reproof, or apprehension. Even when all things went well, there would rest on his mind the weight of responsibility, often sufficient to sink him to the ground. He could not throw off the care upon another. He could not assume the guardian's position, and have around him from fifty to a hundred youth, in the most interesting, because the forming period of their life, without an intense feeling of personal responsibility, and often, therefore, when all was going well, when mirth and joy prevailed, when there was great attention to studies, and respect shown to teachers, and some true sense of life's privileges entertained, he, in the retirement of his study, composing his weekly discourses, found himself intensely occupied with the great care of their souls, and impelled to earnest, tearful prayer for wisdom to guide them in the right paths. To him there was little rest. And while the Institute thus pressed on him its various and weighty burdens, he was also striving to perform his ministerial and pastoral duty, watching over the sheep of his flock, guarding the tender lambs of the fold, and seeking for those who yet were gone astray and knew not the voice of the Chief Shepherd. He was also to be seen wending his way to the bedside of the aged, the sick, and the dying, snatching time from one care or duty that he might employ it elsewhere, attending to secular things and spiritual; to church, congregation, school, and family; to closet, study, and the sick chamber; to reading and manuscript; to business with men of the world, and business with men of piety and faith, laboring to serve one interest and another, to keep bright and glowing the coals of life, in order that the "irons might be ever hot." Yet who is he that escapes without burning his fingers badly from fires like these? Castlereagh, while all was increasingly prosperous in outward respects-society, school, and family-was breaking down under a burden such as consigned W-- to an early grave, that sapped the vigor of B--'s manhood, that drove G--, the talented and eloquent, to the verge of madness. A man may be a minister, a teacher, a lawyer, a merchant, a mechanic, an editor, a doctor, a farmer, and succeed, but make him all these and he will have in the same fire some few too many irons. Withoug knowing it fully, Castlereagh was carrying on his mind too many heavy loads, and his strength was tasked to the highest when others thought he might be at rest. There was for him no rest. Every moment not claimed by his society was claimed by the school, and what was not employed there, was sure to be in the family. Driven on by these great divisions of the army of Duty, happiness, health, and even life itself were imperiled. Before fully aware of it, his nervous system became improperly and dangerously excited, a cold was followed by a cough. The warm suns of June did not, neither did they of July, relieve it. Castlereagh, who had scarcely known a sick day in his life, began to feel unwell, and to apprehend that he had gone too far. Yet who can immediately stop in a career of life, involving all one's capital, all one's plans, all one's relations to the community around him? Nay, who but hopes yet to overcome his present embarrassments and again go forward to the attainment of complete success? So, between hope and distrust, one still struggles, and his bark, strained and quivering from mast-head to keel, is at last  
                     
                         
                           ----cast out on desert shore, 
                           there left to rot 
                           And molder in the winds and rains of heaven. 
                        
                      
                     POLLOCK. 
                  
                
               If he felt his danger, and the need of rest, Castlereagh hoped that a constitution, buoyant and unbroken, would carry him safely through the troubled seas; and if he looked forward to an ultimate change, he still kept on as before, and, apparently, only planned the deeper, and assumed the heavier burden. 
               So the summer went rolling by. Marshall had formed his plan of professional study, and, as it involved a connection with the medical school in Philadelphia, in the fall, Castlereagh, though very unwilling to lose his efficient services, was obliged to look for another teacher for the following year. This he did in good season, and, supposing he had engaged one about to graduate with his class in college, and highly recommended, made himself very easy on that point. The school drew toward its close. Henrietta was bending over the couch of her suffering and beloved sister. Eleanor was far away. Marshall, Miss N--, and Ann Eliza, with other assistants, attended to the interests of the seminary. In the midst of his customary labor at making out the tuition-bills of the pupils, Castlereagh received the following note. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "-- COLLEGE, July 12, 185- 
                              "REV. AND DEAR SIR:-
                            
                           "It gives me unfeigned sorrow to be obliged to write you that, in consequence of the previous partial engagement I was under at the time of our last interview, and of which I did, at the time, inform you, I am, contrary to what I expected after so great an interval of silence, under the necessity of informing you that the gentleman, with whom I had a quasi contract, writes to me that he expects me to fulfill it, his arrangements being already made in the confidence of my doing so. I must, therefore, beg you to release me, as I stipulated for at the time we last met, although, then, I believed that I was in little danger of being called away. 
                           
                              Sincerely yours, 
                              "C-- T--."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               There was no help for this. Castlereagh resigned him, however, with a sigh. The term closed; and commencement came and passed without his having been able to engage another teacher. He wrote letters ters, therefore, to three different colleges, but no satisfactory answers were received. "Let it go," said Castlereagh to Sarah Matilda. "When I take my trip to Saratoga I will hunt up somebody. We are almost sure, now, of Henrietta's return; for, at last, it is decided that Abbie is relieved, and slightly gaining." 
               On the nineteenth day of July, 185-, the summer term closed, and, with it, Marshall's engagement and connection. 
               "I shall ever remember you with deepest interest and pleasure;" said Castlereagh. 
               "My dear sir," he replied; "this has been the happiest year of my life! I shall never forget your sermons; your Wednesday evening prayer-meetings; your family morning and evening devotions; your Institute; the pupils; the wild rambles on these hills-your whole family circle. Remember me in your prayers, and especially pray that I may not forget, in my attention to worldly things, that the Son of Man cometh as a thief in the night." 
               "I shall long pray for you, sir, as one of our well-remembered circle; may your life be a long one, a happy, a useful one." 
               There was the usual hurrying to and fro on the day the school closed. Early in the morning Fitz Maurice climbed the liberty-pole, and flung to the breeze the star-spangled banner which belonged to the Institute, and was always raised at the beginning and close of the term. 
                
               There were some affecting scenes witnessed at this time, as there always is, and will be, when schoolmates separate. Fitz Maurice, after three years of study, furnished with recommendatory letters from Castlereagh and Marshall, would now leave for college. Amos closed his connection with the Institute; Marshall his; Ann Eliza and Miss N--, theirs. And, besides these, there were fifteen or twenty of the dayscholars who, as they came from a distance, would not all return-perhaps few of them. The exercises of the day were gratifying to the teachers and visitors, honorable to the pupils; and, with much earnest feeling, Castlereagh, at the close, invoked on them the blessing of God. Then came the parting scene, when hands were wrung for the last time, and "farewells" were uttered that were never recalled. 
               The sun went down, and darkness came, and stillness, and all but loneliness. The wild ringing of the bell was hushed, the shout of wild enthusiastic boys was over, the quick opening and slamming of doors had passed. A few lingered till the morning, and early sought their night-rest; but most had gone to their homes, and there was the usual quiet that follows the storm-time of a school-term. 
               Before the midnight hour there was born unto Castlereagh a sweet little SCHOLASTICA, a smiling, beautiful daughter, and Johnnie and Hobbie had a sister! Welcome! welcome! sweet little FILLE! The cup of mercy and goodness is running over. How dear is the little smiling daughter in the family of noisy brothers. She comes the tranquilizer, the humanizer, the idol-pet. She is the added link that makes life's chain complete, and the wonder is that you ever lived without her. How the little garons came to love the little fille, to kiss her velvet cheek, to smooth her soft hair, to take her little hand, to watch for her first smiles, and to long till she should creep and walk. How they danced and shouted, and threw themselves on the floor, and bounded on the bed, and rolled over in their glee at every one of her new little ways. And how they begged to carry her in their arms, and declared they were big enough and careful. How, as she grew older, they capsized carriage and all upon the grass, and cried with her, and said it was "too bad; a badie, badie, old carriage, and they would never do so again." How they stopped their ears when she scolded and screamed, and wondered if all babies cried so! Poor things, they had forgotten their own babyhood! 
               "Father," says Johnnie; "don't she grow handsome?" 
               "Tolerable-yes-very." 
               "I think she has pretty eyes," says Hobbie. 
               "And what a sweet mouth," says the mother. 
               "But, oh, mother!" says Johnnie; "do see her pretty nose." 
               "See what a pretty foot she has," says Hobbs. 
               "And what a dear little hand," says Gertrude. 
                
               "Was there ever such a baby before?" says the mother. 
               "Yes, Sarah, ONE-and every mother has it," says the father. 
               "See! see mother, she smiles!" says Johnnie. 
               "Oh! baby," says impulsive Hobbs;" when will you run alone, hey?" 
               "Take care, take care, little boy. You may hurt your tender sister;" says the mother. 
               "Fader," says Hobbie; "I wish we had a lot of brothers." 
               "Ha! ha! good, my son-why so?" 
               "Oh! because then we could play puss in the corner." 
               "How many is a 'lot,' I should like to know?" inquires Johnnie. 
               "Well, five can play it," says Hobbie. 
               "Why, we should have a houseful of noisy boys, indeed," says the father. "One in every corner." 
               At this the boys laugh and the baby smiles, and all conclude that they should have a merry time of it indeed, if there were five boys in the house instead of two. And says Sarah Matilda, "How nice to live in our own new house after our own plan!" 
               Castlereagh looks askance at her, and both smile at that idea. Alas! how many plans, and few frames. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               SARATOGA-BREAKFAST WITH MR. JAMES. 
               THE health of poor Castlereagh must now be looked to. Evidently he is suffering. The cough seems very obstinate, the expectoration profuse, medicine fails to relieve him. He determined to visit Saratoga, and to take with him, as far as the hills of Vermont, his beloved Johnnie, who was pining under the burning suns of July and August, and perhaps extend his own trip to Quebec. We find him at Saratoga. The following letter, termed "My Green Mountain Excursion," will inform the reader how he reached that place.
                     See this letter in the New York Evangelist, Sept. 1853.
                  
                
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "SARATOGA, August 25, 185-. 
                              "DEAR B--:
                            
                           "It is wonderful in my esteem that there should be so wild and magnificent scenery as the Green Mountains present untouched almost by the woodman's ax or the miner's drill, so very near to the great metropolis itself. It is but a short ride to them from your office. Pray go and see them, and take a guide for the trout brooks and lakes-it will do you good. 
                            
                           "The ride from New York, by way of New Haven, Hartford, and Springfield, to Mount Holyoke, at Northampton, is very rapid, through a delightful region of country, but singularly unvarying in its scenery. The view of Long Island Sound, its bays, rivers, and islands, is beautiful. The villages and towns you pass are enchanting and home-like. The wide meadows teem with ripening fruits and corn; but you grow weary by and by of so much taste and fullness, and order and beauty. When your eye therefore catches a good view of a bold mountain ridge, and you see other hills rising in wild grandeur beyond it, and the blue hills and mountains go broken, and rugged, and towering, leaning one upon the other toward the clouds, you first experience a change from the monotonously beautiful to the sublime. Yawning is now over, and you begin to wonder how the cars will get through, and whether there will not be a grand 'slide' or two for your accommodation as you thunder on. The traveler observes at New Haven the bold and rugged bluffs of East and West Rocks, that have braved and routed the dragoons of the tempest clouds in so many pitched encounters, for, we know not the thousandth year! He looks with awakened interest on the ranges of Meriden, the peerless Holyoke. As you sweep up from the sea and along the river, and enter among the mountain gorges, one tall summit after another rises into view, stretching incredibly far away, till you fancy there is nothing but hills and towering Alps in your path. And yet the river, the rail car, and the stage, fine a way rather between than over them. 
                           "We cross the State line of Massachusetts and Vermont. The mountains are now near you, the valleys are narrower, the hills bolder, rugged, covered with an ancient forest. At Brattleboro', where are the much-frequented Hydropathic Hotels, Weselhoeft's and the Lawrence House, we tarried a few days, and clambered up the Chesterfield mountain, nearly one mile to the summit, where there is a rude tower in a dilapidated condition, from whence there is a far-off scene of mountain range that inspires the wildest enthusiasm, and turns the soul's meditations on the POWER that created them-that built the world. Below you, the Connecticut flows winding through the opening gates of the mountains far downward to the sea. The busy, thriving enchanting village is on its very bank, and rising gradually, studded with cottages and farm-houses here and there, which ever decrease in size and number as the eye stretches onward; is the upland in the background that leads your eye at length to rest on the tall, dark, and heaven-piercing summit of the Green Mountain range. We rushed down into the valley by a winding stone staircase, by a curving path, by a steep headlong slide, anon by a well-beaten road, and weary enough, and ravenously hungry, bathed and dined at noon. As we could not now visit the White Mountains, I determined to reach this place by way of the 
                              Green. To do this, one must leave the railroad and take the stage. Bennington lies at the foot of the mountains on the west side, Brattleboro' on the east, forty miles apart-the whole distance by stage. We left the latter village in the afternoon. 
                           "The four and six-horse coaches of the olden time are now 'no more' on this formerly great stage thoroughfare. Two horses, attached to a covered Jersey-like vehicle that will seat six passengers comfortably, draw you. Once in ten or twelve miles, fresh horses relieve the wearied span. The first nine miles of this drive, though agreeable and often wild, and not wanting in variety, is not peculiarly impressive or inviting. Immediately after this, you find yourself creeping up the hills by 'slow coaches' around long curves-up, up to high, and still higher points of the hills. Then you reach the summit or a certain ridge, turn abruptly a corner, and dash down into the valley on the other side. The stream is below, the rude bridge over it. The stage bounds across. You reach another ascending piece of the way. The panting steeds again drag you up, and you strain your eyes away off on the sublime mountains of the east, far, far beyond the village you have left. Just before we arrived at Wilmington, the stage crossed at sundown, the highest range it passes in twenty miles. There we saw, apparently, the whole of the State of Connecticut and the greater part of Massachusetts. Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke seemed but a short jumping distance off. Monadnock, in New Hampshire, forty miles distant, gave us his whole outline from the broad base to the pinnacle. Ascutney, fifty miles off, shot up head and shoulders above his compeers immediately near; and in the foggy, distant, cloud-like drapery beyond, we deemed that we could see the outline of the White Mountains. The village of Wilmington is in the mountains, situated on Deerfield river (or a branch of it), having several hundred inhabitants, four churches, with spires, a large and flourishing seminary, stores and shops, a large hotel, and a large number of very neat and commodious dwellings. It is well supplied with clergymen-one of whom, I learned, lay at the time of my visit on a sick-bed-physicians and lawyers. It is the only flourishing village that occurs in this drive of forty miles, and I could but fancy it grown dingy, somewhat, since the railroad had drawn off its coaches and teams, heavily laden with passengers and freight. In the morning I rose at an early hour, and would have seen the sun flashing his beams over the eastern hills upon this beautiful valley of the Deerfield, and gilding the mountain sides. But, no; clouds had gathered during the night, not only obscuring the comet, but the moon and the stars. It was also cold; fires were glowing in the stores, overcoats were needed for the journey, and-hark! there is the tolling bell. At the sunrisehour a low, mournful sound from the church tower echoed and re-echoed among the hills, and carried up the serpentine way of the streams, tells you-speaks to all the listening ears of the dwellers in the vale and on the sides of the mountains, that the little sick and suffering child is dead! The great King of Terrors is also in the mountain! Have I rode so near to him? Is he not busy in the Southern cities, on the distant prairie, in the hot and thronged metropolis? Yes; but he is also HERE! He is every where, stopping life's current, and changing laughter into wailing. 
                           "My traveling companion this morning was a spare, sun-brown, wasted figure of a woman sixty years of age. This was her first ride in a stage! Sixty years of hard toil she had passed on these hill-sides, reared her family, married off her children, save a boy of twenty-two, whom she now proposes, from maternal anxiety, to visit, buried her husband, heard awful thunder-tones, and the swelled torrent's roaring, and the tempest's uproar, but she has never been within either stage or car! A godly, pious, Bible-reading, praying mother-a Baptist. She goes to see her son; and he longs for the ocean. He has heard of the "BOUNDING BILLOW." Ah! William, William: thy mother and thee think differently of the world's tossings and temptations. 
                           "But what a magnificent ride we have through the mountain gorges, and over their range. What heights ascend, wht summits bare, and rocky and fearful, anon densely-wooded, and beautiful and far away, gaze on and paint on memory's canvas. And the storm, too, yes, the cold heavy rain comes on, and we button closely our overcoats, tie up the neck and fold firmly the arms. The driver slouches his Kossuth, buttons to his chin his 'fear naught,' and now, with two additional passengers, a pretty school-mistress-who will leave us at some rude bridge and seek her charge in the RED SCHOOL-HOUSE nigh to it-and a young gentleman from Boston-having gained the highest point of land in his route, and crossed the table-land, pitches boldly over the summit, and down along the windings of as mad a streamlet as the mountains boast, urges his high-mettled steeds. You look along the steep descent thirty or forty rods, having gentle windings and numerous ridges or crossings over which you are carried, sometimes with a violence that throws you forward almost into the front seat, and the reaction casts you back into a fearful proximity with the rear walls of the coach; then you lose your umbrella bracings and cling to a post. Anon your feet lose the quality of friction, and slide you nearly to their level, the coach's bottom. But you regain as oft as you lose it, your equilibrium, and smiling and chatting, brave the rapid, tossing and jolting descent. The road is lost to the eye now. It makes a sudden curve. There it is again, twenty, thirty rods before you; the ridges awful to cros, the road steep and stony, the wild creek roaring along its rocky channel, the road walled away from it-a dangerous proximity. Away go to the Morgan bloods! Down, down, DOWN! Another curve. The road seems lost. A little level is gained. We look up. The mountains are frowning over our heads. We are going down into as wild a gorge as panthers ever found, as the skulking savage ever loved. Again we are on the verge of another descent. It is long, fearful, steep, worn by the rains, close by the walls of the stream! Down go the bays, their ears erect, their step light and careless, but see, how sure! Noble HORSE! not a trip, not a falter, not a slide, not a misstep. If he were not-but he is sure! If the harness were weak-but it is not. Is the driver afraid? He is not afraid. Is he skillful? He is. Is he judicious? See, he lifts his whip. The blow falls on his stoutest, best, wildest horse-it smarts a second time and a third. We shall be hurled off the precipice! Not at all. The horse must be trained to do his whole duty. We are in more peril now than ever; the road rough, the descent sudden, and the blood of the noble steed quickened to his very nostrils. We shall go down in safety. Curving thus, and bounding thus, and hoping long for the end, after a three, or four, or five-mile drive down the mountain, we reach the stony level of Bennington, and dine leisurely (our nerves unstrung by their excitement, the feeble widow vainly applying her handkerchief to absorb her tears, either of suffering or of joy and gratitude) alone at the hotel. Courage, good woman, you will soon find your son. Your first stage-ride will, I fancy, not soon be forgotten-but the next may be, if not so full of nature's wild and rough outside-so grand and uplifting to the soul- more gentle and soothing, such as thy shady side of earth's pilgrimage would seem to be thy due! Assisting her to an easy top-buggy with a driver, I saw her depart to Pittstown, over a smooth road, fifteen miles away, to meet her son. 
                           "A good hard grip of J's hand at Bennington, a hurried dinner with him, and I reached the cars again, lame, fatigued, and jammed in every bone of the body, but completely happy! In the morning of the previous day I had gone with Hll and Cr to the summit of the Chesterfield range, and now had crossed the Green Mountains. I had seen more of nature in her solitude, and beauty, and sublimity, in these few hours, than I had hoped to see in weeks or months. Here, at our very doors almost, is a world of wild green forest, and towering hills and roaring streams, that may all be seen and appropriated to one's enjoyment and improvement, and yet the traveler knows it not, or hurries away, loth to delay his journey or to change its mode. But I will not soon forget the sweet sleep I had in thy highlands Green Mountains! Nor thy sublime scenery, nor the perils (as it seemed), and positively dashing drive down thy western slope and gorges! Nor thy voices of truth, assuring me there are IMMORTAL hills! 
                           "At eight o'clock the same evening, I reached this place in the cars, by way of Troy. But of course, after what had been seen in the wild headlands of nature, every scene from the cars was tameness itself, so I dozed away the ride of sixty or seventy miles, to the great watering rendezvous of the New World, where Fashion holds her Carnival, nominally seeking health and length of days. 
                           
                              "Yours, 
                              "E--."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               At Saratoga, if a man has any sort of respect for mineral beverages, the first thing every morning, before breakfast, is a walk from the hotel to the Congress, Iodine, or Empire Springs. When there he must not be too much in a hurry. It does not look well to crowd, nor is it conductive to a calm imbibing of the sparkling waters. One must stand and chat with his friends a few minutes, edging a little nearer the fountain the mean time, and sharpening his thirst by looking how fast the goblets are being filled and emptied. He must observe how carelessly the people quaff off two, four, and six glasses, and how ceremoniously they smack their lips, and try to wipe the tears from their eyes. Above all, he must feel in his purse for a few coppers for the waiters, and not be a sneak in this respect. It aids much in making way with five and six glasses to have an idea that the waiters are not tired of dipping up for you. He must, by all means, put on an easy, cheerful, healthy look, for nobody at Saratoga wishes to be considered an invalid. Let him rub his cheeks into a glow, bite the pale out of his lips, puff out his cheeks, flourish his cane in the air, walk erect, look perfectly complacent, never cough out loud, nor talk about ill health, unless it be of ennui and dyspepsia. Call and fee Doctors A., B., and C., because it is fashionable to take a blue pill, and pretend to be prodigiously rigorous with yourself about health. Still this must be all assumed. It must be assumed by those who see your gay and easy carriage, that you are one of the most thoroughly observant dietetics, pilltakers, and water-drinkers at Saratoga. This will atone for all seeming dissipation and inconsistencies. Saratoga is a capital place to study character, yet the last place in the world to learn it. Character there is generally put on, or seen the other side out. And yet it is a clever set of anomalies, do and say what you will about it. He had better be at home digging clams, boot deep in the mud, his current employment, who can't play well a ten thousand-dollar part at the Springs. 
               Castlereagh drank the waters, and walked in the groves, and rode in the cars, and listened to the music, and visited the Indian encampment, the Lakes, the Battle-ground-the Waterloo of America-the racegrounds, the beautiful country, read the newspapers, visited the Post-office three times a day, became familiar with the lions of the place, and was after all-exceedingly lonesome, nervous, debilitated, not very well. He really went to Saratoga in pursuit of health, hoping for quiet, and a retired, agreeable sojourn there. But every day he heard more noise, grew more discontented, and thought of leaving. Hardly, however, would he form this intention than a waiter, with a card from some friend, would be at his door, and a ride or a walk would postpone all action of that sort to another day. Letters from home kept him cheerful, and after a time he really began to think himself curing up. 
               One morning he observed at the breakfast-table, immediately opposite to him, a young man with spectacles, very dark hair and features, with mustache, well dressed, though negligently, and a determined eater, especially fond of strong coffee. His self-possessed and easy manners interested Castlereagh, and the relish of his coffee imparted a little of its aroma to his own cup. As he lingered after most had left the table, and cried out, "Waiter! coffee," Castlereagh did the same, and as they stirred in milk and sugar, they began to eye one another, and, says the stranger, 
               "I see you like coffee, sir." 
               Castlereagh was obliged to say "Yes," although he thought the stranger used two words for himself. 
               "Well," said the other, "I always drink coffee at the Springs. It's a happy offset to blue pills and Congress-water." 
               "Then you are not an invalid, nor a careful dietist?" 
               "I am, sir, both-a great scrofula-invalid, and remarkably thorough in my diet, always excepting, sir, you know, at the Springs!" 
               "Ha, ha! I supposed it might come to that." 
                
               "Yes. You see the waters don't do any body good while here, but after you get home. I am laying a foundation here to build on when I once get away-do you perceive?" 
               "Oh! yes; I perceive a great many inconsistencies." 
               "Just so-'inconsistency'-that's the word. Inconsistency at Saratoga is the very order and science of health at home. A man gets used up at the Springs, and goes home to diet and recruit." 
               "A very ingenious and useful method of spending money and time," said Castlereagh. 
               "Extremely so, sir," said the other with a smile; "Waiter!-coffee." 
               Castlereagh was amused, and stirred and sipped gently. 
               "Now, friend," said the other, "just take a fresh hot cup, and it will set you up for all day; depend on it now-'my word for it,' as we say at WILLIAMS'." 
               "Thank you, thank you," he replied; "I more fear it would put me down." 
               "Not at all, not at all. Why, sir, strong coffee well made is a decided stimulative, and will relieve the system instead of packing it and deadening. Now, sir, I almost killed myself on weak coffee-" 
               "Oh, that is bad, I know," interrupted Castlereagh. 
               "Yes, sir. You see this scrofula development; well, sir, it made its appearance under the diluted-coffee 
                  regim. But strong coffee is fast using it up, you see, hey?" 
               Castlereagh did not know how it was. 
               "Oh! yes," says the other, "it is very plain. Why, sir, I weigh more, sleep better, eat heartier by ten per cent. than a fortnight ago." 
               "Possible?" 
               "True, sir. And I go back in a year to Williams' a new man." 
               "Hope you may, sir. Then you are not through at Williams'?" 
               "Through! oh, no, sir. Another year, a whole year, sir. And I am glad of it, for I love college, sir, and would stay there ten years if it were possible." 
               "It is hard to break away from college." 
               "Yes, dreadful, dreadful. But I am going to try it now for one year." 
               "Why so?" 
               "Because, rather run ashore for funds and a little in bad health. Why, sir, you won't credit it me, perhaps, but it is a fact that I am now looking for a place to earn money for a year to go back at the expiration of the time and finish out at college. This I do with the consent of my good old father, heaven bless him." 
               "And who, if I may be so bold as to inquire, is your father?" 
               "My father, sir, is the Rev. R. James, of B--, Vermont, and I am his oldest son, Horace--" 
               Castlereagh leaped out of his chair, and stretched his arm across the table. "Why, my dear young friend!" said he, "your father was my early preceptor, and fitted me for college." 
               "I knew it," said young James, "I knew you the first time you sat at this table a fortnight ago. (Waiter! COFFEE!!) Why, my dear sir, do you suppose I have lived from infancy in B-and have heard you preach every year on your annual visit to your native town, without recognizing Elbert Castlereagh?" 
               "Well, but why have you not spoken to me?" 
               "Because you never before gave me an opportunity." 
               "Extraordinary! Why, I remember you now very well. Your mother I recollect. Your father I revere as I do no other man on the face of the earth. I hope we shall see each other often while here." 
               "It will be very gratifying to me, sir," said Horace. 
               "And you are looking up a place for business out of college for the ensuing year?" 
               "I am." 
               "It is to be regretted that you can not go immediately on." 
               "Yes; but seriously, I am ashore for funds and in need of relaxation." 
               "What business do you desire?" 
               "I have no great choice, provided it pays well." 
               Castlereagh invited him to his room. There they conversed together for an hour, and when James left it, it was as an engaged tutor in the Lindenvale Institute for the coming year. 
                
               Castlereagh wrote a short line to the Rev. Mr James on the subject, and the following note to Sarah Matilda.

               On the following week, Castlereagh returned again to the eastward by a northerly circuit, and became decidedly more unwell. Letters received caused him hastily to pack up and go home. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               IN WHICH SOME SIGNS APPEAR AGAINST THE DREAM. 
                
                  
                      
                        The tide drifts on-drifts out to sea- 
                        Scholastici-Scholastic. 
                     
                   
                
               CASTLEREAGH arrived just in season to attend the funeral of AUGUSTUS, a very dear friend of his in Lindenvale, who, after a long sickness, during which he gave himself away to the Redeemer, died in the good hope of one of his own dear children, weeping over his sins, and looking up into the face of Jesus with the assurance of immortal life. 
               "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 
               A cold, funerals, preaching, the excitement and labor of term commencing, poor health to work with-these prostrated Castlereagh, as he had never been before; and his people began to say of him, in whispers at the first, which grew louder by and by: "He has not long to stay with us!" 
               Who has looked on the grim countenance of death, from scenes of activity, prosperity, happiness, and usefulness, without a shudder-without manifold shrinkings of heart and throbbings of his nature? Who has not turned this way and that for shelter? who has not prayed, and wept, and wrung his hands, and sighed, and cast an imploring eye on his wife and children, and on all his house, and on every familiar object, and by the multiplicity of life's home-scenes brought an argument against death's cold presence that, he would fain persuade himself, should foil him? And yet, the footsteps of the grave king, come they nearer still? Do the lineaments of his countenance become more indicative of failing strength? does discouragement accompany labored breathings, heavy eye-lids, paling cheeks, and trembling nerves? Does he near you still, from whose cold touch the warm nature shrinks? And where is the refuge-where the Rock inassailable to which you may fly and feel secure, from whence you may exclaim: "Rejoice not over me, oh, mine enemy! neither make thy boast over me, as over the slain?" Is there such a hiding-place and tower, where the winged arrow can not fly? where the fallen nature shall fail of the death-wound? Nay, there is none such. But there IS a weapon of victory over even death. There is relief from the fear of his coming. There is that overcometh this gret enemy of our life. AUGUSTUS, LUCY, MARY JOSEPHINE, found it. In FAITH they were more than conquerors, and could exclaim: "Oh, grave! where is thy victory. Oh, death! where is thy sting? Thanks be to God, who giveth us US the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ." 
               Castlereagh was forced to contemplate the dark and fearful side of life now, and to ask himself the solemn question: "Can I bid the world farewell?" After a long and intense struggle, he was enabled entirely to rest his spirit in the hands of Christ, and calmly endure the breaking over him of affliction's waves and billows. They came. 
               Notwithstanding the manifestation of ill-health, and the desire of his heart for rest from care, he never had more business to occupy him than now. The time arrived for the commencement of the school, and as he must go on, or stop, there being no half-way course, he determined to proceed. His school was extensively advertised-thoroughly known in the community, and he had more applications than usual for admisssion into the family. His rooms were all full, and the school-desks were uncomfortably crowded. 
               Punctual to his engagement, Mr. James arrived the evening before the term commenced. He was looking brown from exposure in his travels, was robust, and in good spirits. He was kindly and warmly welcomed, and forthwith made himself at home. Castlereagh, after introducing him to his family, conducted him to the room prepared for his accommodation in the south-east corner of the Institute. Here he could have an immediate care of the pupils lodged around him, and also attend to their evening pursuits in the large STUDIO adjoining. This was a long ante-room, looking out on the south, with a large stove, and tables in the center, desks, seats, and benches along the sides, with reflectors ors here and there to make it light, and the walls embellished with highly-wrought maps, paintings, lithographs and heads. Nine doors opened from it with as many dormitories, that looked out on the east, north, and west sides of the Institute, embracing together a most unrivaled scene of beauty and grandeur. 
               It was a delightful hour from seven o'clock to eight in the evening, which those pupils passed in the studio together, each one seated at his desk or table, Mr. James overseeing their studies, and Castlereagh, or some other member of the family occasionally dropping in. It never failed to interest Castlereagh as he made one in their group, and witnessed their industry, contentment, and progress. "Here," he would say, "if it can be found on earth, is happinesss. And here is the promise of good-will to man and peace on earth. Here is the 'DREAM' fulfilled. It was not in vain that I commenced this effort, although 'I am expiating' some of my errors in the management of affairs. Was it not an 'heavenly impulse,' notwithstanding so much of disappointment, trial, vexation, and suffering?" 
               To the great joy of all, and rather unexpectedly, Miss Henrietta Buckley returned and resumed her position in the school, her sister being apparently convalescent. Fitz Maurice, Edgar, Eaton, Erastus, Underhill, William, Eleanor, Ann Eliza, and many others, formerly in the school and family, had left. But new pupils came in their places. Harry Otis and Hayden returned, but S-- did not. James Hallock, William Roberts, and John Crosby were received. 
               Ann Eliza Castlereagh left her brother to visit relatives at the West, and Sarah Matilda urged her own sister, Blanche Haywood, to pass the year with her as an assistant in music. The invitation, greatly to her relief, was accepted, and the pupils in music were placed under her immediate care and instruction. The family, with the boarding-pupils and teachers, now numbered from twenty-five to thirty persons. This was as large a number as Castlereagh could accommodate, without considerable expense and labor in altering his house, a matter, which although often designed, his ill-health, prostrating his strength and checking his ambition and prosperity, compelled him to abandon. He had already ascertained that the "DREAM" was not all true. He had found many occasions of severe discipline, and many scenes had risen before him that showed him the indiscretion of youth, and how unreliable they were even in respect to his most practicable plans and most cherished theories. He had come to see and feel the "wear and tear" of the Scholastic-to experience the realities of the school-room and the burdens of the practical school-teacher. Here was a class of fiery, headlong fellows. There a set of dull, phlegmatic boys, and another group were surly discontents. Here and there were found faithful ones and zealous students. But by far the greater part were thankless of their opportunities and a long way off from the Millennium lennium. It was hard work to get out of them good lessons, and harder still to get them into any enthusiasm, hardest work of all to inspire them with a religious ambition and a life-purpose of duty. He came to know that there were fine scholars and pure hearts, and also to see how delightful was the work to educate a certain portion of them; but he found that they were a decided minority, and that life's labor was with the great, dull Democracy. He found some comfort as he reflected on the future of these same pupils, in this, that they would be the better for his exertions-although not very high up, even then. Poor Castlereagh! about to reason himself repaid, although far down the hill of his ambition. The romance of the dream vanished. What remained was all the commonest hard work of life, the natural consequences of the curse in the Fall. He found that his theories went into practicalities with very indirect movements, and that although education is eminently desirable, and religion indispensable to happiness and true greatness, yet neither the one nor the other can be had cheap. There must be brain-work and heart-work to accomplish results so truly desirable. In this he was not so much disappointed as in the discouraging influence on himself of these labors, and constant familiar intercourse with a work of such incessant exertion. He was in five years worn to a shadow, and his energy of character lay all shriveled and torn, like the faded banner that in the sleet-storm of December froze to the Seminary flag-staff, snapped all night in a fierce gale, and was at last lowered a mournful-looking memento of its former beauty. Still Castlereagh, as he thought on his busy life of late, dared not say it had been better not to have been. He dared not wish it other than it was, except that it might, with the same exertion, have been riper in results. And at last he saw that men may plan, and dream, and work, but it is God alone who giveth the increase, and God alone to whom is the glory, and that in the weakness of the creature shines out the power of the Creator. 
               Castlereagh was pained to see the impress of anxiety and care wrought on the countenance of Henrietta Buckley. She had evidently passed a tearful series of weeks in the presence of her suffering, uncomplaining, drooping sister, Abbie. But there came now some new hopes in her heart (and in the sick one's), and in the hearts of brothers and of parents, that the loved one would be restored to them-nay, they believed it. With one voice they bade Henrietta leave home and its consequent confinement, and seek relief in those agreeable circles at the Institute from which she had voluntarily banished herself so long. 
               Entering warmly into one another's ideas of classification, the teachers, with a little help from Castlereagh, who now walked about with a staff, brought the Seminary, at present overflowing with scholars, into a very happy and promising arrangement of classes. After the morning's devotions, four of the pupils attended tended to their music practice or lessons. In an hour, they were succeeded by as many more, and so through the morning and a part of the afternoon. The advanced class in Latin, and the advanced class in Greek, were first heard by Mr. James, the reading classes by Miss Henrietta. Then alternating, she attended to a large class of beginners in Latin, while he gave instruction to the higher classes in reading, and the power of letters and words. These exercises were followed by recitations in geometry, algebra, surveying, and arithmetic. These came in four divisions. To them succeeded geography and grammar. The branches more deservedly entitled ornamental and light, were made the order of the afternoon. Also M. Dupont came every afternoon from the city, and taught a class of twenty pupils in French. 
               There were, besides Castlereagh, Mrs. Castlereagh, and Blanche, and those instructors and teachers already named, four assistant pupils, one of whom had in charge a class of juveniles of good families; and thus the work went daily on. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               INVOCATION. 
               THE school progressed happily. Castlereagh was compelled to give it up almost entirely into the hands of others, although seldom so unwell as to be confined to his room. Occasionally he would seem to rally and be himself again. He often met and conversed with his pupils, as formerly. But his evenings were frequently spent in the retirement of his study or chamber. 
               On one occasion he was disturbed by learning that the boys disagreed among themselves, and, that for some days, two of them refused to speak to each other. Again Hallock complained that Hayden had poured water from his window, in the partition, on to his head when he was asleep. Hayden said "he only sprinkled him a little because he wouldn't rise at prayer-bell." But Hallock, affirming that he poured a stream on him, Hayden replied, "That whether it was little or much, it was in retaliation for his filling his boots with water, and drowning in it his stockings, 'to boot.'" One day Roberts came trembling and crying, and said "that all the boys had pitched against his door, broke it, crowding off the lock; and then fell upon him and beat him. He did not know what he had done to deserve it. On inquiry, he found that Roberts had armed himself with a club and a pistol, and then, calling the boys cowards, dared them to attack him, which they did, and, routing him, he fled to his room and barricaded the door. But unfortunately, one of the boys, in his zeal, pushed against the panel too hard, cracking, and injuring it considerably." But the informant was told, as in all such cases Castlereagh made it a point to inform the party complaining, that he could not affix punishment to one party alone when it was made to appear that both were guilty. 
               Every thing of the kind excited Castlereagh, and greatly injured him. It retarded his improvement, or it accelerated his decline. And "the year was bound," he said, "to be unfortunate." Hardly had the term half expired ere it became imperatively necessary that Henrietta should return home to recommence the sisterly care of the now re-drooping Abbie. One of his bright lads was taken by his father to the distant West. Another, coming out early one Monday morning from the city, was knocked down in the street by a furiously-driven span of horses, and taken up insensible. It was several weeks before he left his room. Another it was thought advisable to dismiss, and still another, on account of sickness, left; and the Institute, notwithstanding every attention on the part of Mr. James, who found his hands and time wholly occupied, seemed to lose its former prestige, and, like its proprietor, droop. Yet never was there a more cheerful winter passed in the family than this. They were nearly all musicians. They were, many of them, friends of long-standing, and felt at home with each other. They commiserated Castlereagh, and sought to lighten his burden of care. They spent many a pleasant evening together, and were happy also in the society of many young and interesting persons of the village. The cheerful scenes at the Institute home, left no room for a desire to rove abroad in quest of evening amusements. Seldom did either the young gentlemen or ladies ask permission to spend an idle hour away, although, not unfrequently, there were evenings when the whole family of boarders had invitations out. 
               During the winter Castlereagh seldom officiated in his pulpit. Many and many a "bright, holy Sabbath day" he passed at home; often walking his study, stopping for a moment at the window, from which he looked forth on his house of worship, and, sighing in spirit at his seclusion from its hallowed services, and then resuming his trembling tread across the apartment. Now ruminating on the ways of Providence, and noting how various are the methods by which he administers the reproof we have incurred by sinning; anon, perusing the Word of God, seeking, by prayer, his support, and acquiring ever some clearer insight of his heart. These Sabbath days whiled away at home, though days of rest to his physical nature, were often drooping days to his soul, for they were the "iron that entered" it, the thorn that pained him. Why must he be denied to tread "thy hallowed courts, thou city of my God?" By degrees, it became something of a habit with him to suffer this suspension of his privileges, to look out of his windows on the passing, cheerful group, strong, young, and healthy, wending their way to the house of prayer. He acknowledged the justice of the correction, and felt that he could offer up with his heart the utterances of his lips, "Thy will, oh God, be done." Under circumstances of this nature, so trying to a pastor's heart, dwelling on the blessings, and the necessity, and the grace of the Sabbath; his thoughts would sometimes find expression thus:- 
                      
                        Oh! holy, holy Sabbath day! 
                        Earth's resting from her cares and tears; 
                        Jehovah's smile on fallen man- 
                        Memorial ages are thy years! 
                     
                      
                        Oh, holy, heavenly token, 
                        A joyful signal, glory-given 
                        To every straying, mourning soul, 
                        That earth confines on heaven. 
                     
                      
                        Sweet, holy Sabbath! Holy day, 
                        Thou day of tranquil, spirit-rest; 
                        I spring across thy threshold fair, 
                        And hail thee-fold thee to my breast! 
                     
                     
                      
                        Oh, radiant morn of Sabbath day! 
                        Kind, heavenly comforter on earth; 
                        Let me in all my sorrows, joy 
                        To speak the story of thy birth. 
                     
                      
                        Earth had, at first, no Sabbath day; 
                        Creation's work was incomplete, 
                        Though Earth and sky-and MAN were formed, 
                        And trees that yielded fruit for meat. 
                     
                      
                        Creation's Sabbath day was given, 
                        When erst the six days work was done; 
                        A holy, hallowed type of heaven, 
                        Great highway of the soul's return.- 
                     
                      
                        For oh! what avenue of hope, 
                        In vista, long and fair, appeared; 
                        Where wanderers from their father's love 
                        Might press their way-divinely cheered? 
                     
                      
                        Then rested He, creation's Lord, 
                        From all the labors he had wrought; 
                        And o'er the new-made world was poured 
                        A smile baptismal, by her God! 
                     
                      
                        His REST he named the Sabbath-day, 
                        Sweet ante-type of that above; 
                        In the far azure-vaulted sky, 
                        Where saints and angels dwell, and love. 
                     
                      
                        And at thy birth the morning stars, 
                        The heavenly anthems piled in song; 
                        While sons of God all shouted forth 
                        The strains that saints on earth prolong. 
                     
                      
                        Then holy, reverend Sabbath-day- 
                        The respite day from earthly care; 
                        Here, worn and weary with my sins, 
                        May I not joy in thee with prayer? 
                     
                     
                      
                        Come holy, blessed, Sabbath-day, 
                        Distill thy fragrant odors here; 
                        I feel a joy, a calm, divine, 
                        While faith and love forbid my fear. 
                     
                      
                        I lean me on thy wings, oh day! 
                        Thou soul-inspiring day of rest. 
                        Then bear me to those regions fair, 
                        Perpectual, peaceful, holy, blest. 
                     
                  
                
               The nature of his illness forbidding him much exercise or exposure during the winter and spring, it occurred to him that as he could neither preach nor go abroad, he might occupy himself in the work of preparing a manuscript for the press. Writing did not seem to weary him, and as his expenses were considerably increased by his indisposition, it being, in addition to other charges, often necessary for him to hire preachers for the Sabbath, he thought himself at liberty to employ his pen in that way. When he came fully to entertain the idea, he seized his pen and sat down to write. The first dash of the ink showed him that he must have something definite to write about. He must decide the character if his work-whether it should be a dictionary, a spelling-book, a history-what kind of history? a biography-whose? a tale of whom-and where? a scientific work-of what science? a religious work, a poem, an autobiography, a compilation, a book of psalmody, a book of sermons, a book of prayers and homilies? Finally he concluded that he would write a book that should contain some interesting reflections on all subjects, based on a compilation of unquestionable facts, to be called "The Modern Factotum Omnium Gatherum." Pushing his pen along quite vigorously, he, at the end of twenty-five pages, found himself against a stump, and concluded the subject too general! Throwing the pen aside, he ruminated two or three days upon the matter, and concluded to write a work of a practical, miscellaneous nature, for common reading. He wrote ninety pages, and tore them up! For a week he seriously contemplated writing a new school-book, on the ground that this was a department of literature not fully occupied! but gave it up. By this time he had begun to feel a real ambition in the enterprize, had bethought him of a new, proper, and simple method of procedure, had decided on the kind of book he wanted, its title and object, and sitting down anew, in six weeks he ended his manuscript. Taking it to an excellent publishing house in New York city, it was published anonymously, went, in a few months, through several editions, and yielded him the snug sum of six hundred dollars. This was a relief to him, for as the spring term drew near its close, Castlereagh was distressed to find that he was, to some extent, embarrassed. The very great expenses of the year, united to his own indisposition, had thrown the balance of accounts against him. He was therefore gratified for the relief which so unexpectedly came to him, by which his notes due in April and May, at the bank, were met without any difficulty, and some small, uncomfortable bills discharged. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               THE PARLOR EXAMINATION. 
               THE last day of the term arrived, the last half-day, and last half of that. There were assembled in the large parlor of the parsonage the whole group of pupils belonging to the Seminary, to receive their presents. The musical examination and the closing address of their teachers were also to come off. The music was performed with much good taste and spirit, some little misses playing admirably; and among the young gentlemen, Harry Otis and Hayden excelling. 
               The young ladies were seated in front of the piano and immediately around it, while the lady visitors, their parents, and friends, occupied chairs near the walls. The boys sat further back, and behind and around them were the gentlemen present. The music ended, a large table, that occupied the center of the room was uncovered, exposing to view the beautiful and varied presents-medals, fancy baskets, elegant books, rich and highly-polished knives, beautiful portemonnaies, and many an article exceedingly delicate and pretty of less cost and pretensions. Castlereagh, pale and feeble, though not yielding to his complaint, nor murmuring at its dispensation, found himself once more among his beloved young pupils, about to reward them for their perseverance and success in their studies and varied branches of mental culture, and to bestow, beside the prizes, some little testimonial on every one of the good and happy number before him. He was also reminded of his physical decay, of the shortness of time, and that this might be the last of those interesting scenes in which, for five busy years almost run, he had so often had a prominent and interesting part to perform. Johnnie, carefully dressed for the occasion, stood near his father, and as the names of the prize-holders were mentioned, the prize assigned was handed to the little fellow, and by him taken and presented to the fortunate pupil. Thus were distributed first and second prizes for scholarship in general; first and second prizes for behavior; prizes in original composition and declamation, in penmanship, in drawing, and for music. 
               There is always danger, as prizes are usually conferred on pupils for superior talent or success, that much ill-will may be engendered in the hearts of those who are disappointed; that bitter feelings and caustic remarks may be indulged toward the teachers, and the evil of discontent arise, and the malignant poisons of jealousy and envy circulate, to the neutralizing of all the good that was sought by the bestowment of rewards, and to the hinderance of a proper, healthful action of many minds ever afterward. Castlereagh had seen this, and he had adopted the course of presenting, at the close of the school, a testimonial of regard to every one of the scholars, not always equally costly, and prizes, at the same time, to those who had fairly won them. The effect was eminently happy. He observed that the mind of the pupil was painfully convulsed when, failing of a prize that had been labored for, he came to the last hour of the term, and was made to see his rival crowned and made a hero, and THE scholar, while himself, though but a single half dozen marks below him, was wholly ignored! He observed that the fact of the disappointed pupil not obtaining any notice, other than in a complimentary, extempore remark general to the school, was very oppressive and mortifying. He accordingly determined that while the prize system should not be abolished, he would ingraft with it the testimonial reward system, which should be a personal token from himself to each one of the pupils. It is true this would require some expense, occupy time, and add to his labor. But it would gratify and encourage the pupils. Castlereagh went repeatedly to New York and elsewhere to make selections of articles appropriate to be distributed among them. Once he purchased, at no very great expense, a large invoice of English illustrated books, which he carefully assigned among his scholars, according to merit, greatly to their pleasure. He had the satisfaction to notice that a present given to every pupil, in the same public manner as the prizes, although called a present, and not a prize, had the effect to soothe down the irritation of the school often consequent on the presentation to certain ones of special marks of favoritism, and the rewards for successful rivalry in the diplomacy of class recitations, while it did not essentially alter the JUST value and position of the prize. 
               When the prizes and gifts had been all presented, and every face was beaming with intensest pleasure and gratification, Castlereagh addressed them a few moments in a calm and cheerful way, assuring them of his interest in them all, and saying that he did not despair yet of regaining in a good degree his health, that he might continue to instruct them; but whether he should long survive or be quite laid aside, he rejoiced in their youth, their health, their talents, their happiness. He then invited them to accompany him in their thoughts while he opened his mouth in prayer to God. They were all in a moment hushed to perfect order, and listened most attentively; and many a one wept and bethought him of the seriousness of life, the great, only theater of, and preparation for, death. Castlereagh then bidding them all a kind "good-by," they soon went pouring forth from the house, uttering their farewells, shaking each other warmly by the hand, weeping, embracing, saluting. Oh, blessed days of school remembrances, how ye come up, thronging visions of by-gone happiness and joy! Oh! how ye hold out the tantalizing cup of other days-those school days gone, never more coming back to gladden us, and bid us drink its joy-bidding, but withdrawing it from our too eager lips. 
               An open and familiar correspondence between Castlereagh and the excellent and truly friendly father of Harry Otis, in relation to his son's future course, led them both to the conclusion that it would be well for the young man to enter another institution more immediately calculated to prepare him for the business into which he would finally enter. Castlereagh knew it was best that Harry Otis should leave him, but there were many tender chords that must break as they parted-many hot tears gush forth-many a trembling word be spoken. 
               The parting, however, came in the morning. All the evening and early morning, the boys and girls were very busy "packing." Mrs. Castlereagh, and Blanche, and Gertrude assisting here and there, especially the younger girls, some of whom were to return no more. Alas! how can be spared the gentle, loving Isabel, whose tractable, affectionate disposition and winning ways have earned her the frequent caress, the ever-approving smile, the tender love of the whole circle. Go, dear child, lavish thy full heart's treasures upon the happy group of re-united sisters, bless with thy sunny presence thy fond father's cheerful home. Trunks and carpet-bags disposed of, Stella accompanies Isabel on her farewell ramble over the Seminary grounds. Each sheltered study-nook, each rabbit-coop and chicken-fold, each see-saw and swing is visited. A formal good-by bestowed upon the school-room, and the circuit finished, the warm-hearted creature threw herself into Blanche's embrace, and weeping, wished almost she need not go. 
               But at length the omnibus and stages arrived, and then there was loading, bustle, hurry, confusion, shaking hands, and warm, affectionate adieux. Castlereagh leaned upon his staff, and bade them one after another a cordial adieu, and kissed them. He said but little to Harry Otis, but followed him with his eye, and kept near him with his heart. At length, all were nearly arranged and seated in their places, nearly all had said their farewells, nearly all had taken last embraces. It was Harry Otis's turn to leap into the stage. It waited for him, but he stood immovable. He could not move till he had taken once more, it might be the last time, his beloved preceptor by the hand, and begged of him an interest in his prayers and a place in his warmest recollections. Castlereagh seemed instinctively to read his thoughts, and as Harry Otis turned toward him, he dropped his staff, and casting both his arms around him, held him to his heart. 
               "Yes, yes; I know what you would say, my son. I shall never forget you. Go, and may the Almighty bless you and prepare you for his heavenly kingdom." 
                
               "Sister," said a weak, pale, emaciated sufferer, "I am near now to my last, long night. This night you must abide with me, and sleep by me, and help prepare me for that." 
               Human language can not depict the suffering that Miss Abbie Buckley experienced during the long twelve-month wherein many a time it would have been sweetness itself to die. Oh, no, she could not enjoy then so great a mercy, but she must linger on, and abide the will of her Heavenly Father and Saviour. Hopes and wishes had induced many a one to say that she would eventually recover. But the word had gone forth to the angel, and he had been drawing down around her the folding of his wings in their mighty compression, reducing the life-principle to a mere dependency on their opening or folding up. A little space the breathing in her yet occupied; but that little was too small to assure her of life-far too small to answer the great end of life, and she felt that she must be gathered to her fathers. For her there was a silent, painless grave, a sure rest, and beyond the grave a peaceful and glorious home. 
               So Henrietta staid all that night with her. She folded her in her arms, she fanned her, she calmed her, she spake to her of Jesus, the sinner's friend and sacrifice. She prayed with her, wept over her, fondly, oh, how fondly! loved her. Yes, for she was a darling sister-the only one. They had lived and loved together. How many days, how many nights they had passed together! How many visits made together! How many letters written and received! How many little sisterly confidences enjoyed! How many tears in secret dropped over their youthful sorrows! How they had grown together to mature youth, and were looking forward on the bright coming future of life! Alas, alas! was it in vain? Must the angel of death hover on his wing so near! The lights in her apartment give a faint glimmering. The steps that move now and then across it, are as soft as a child's. The breathings of the young angel-bound spirit are gentle puffings of life's-breeze going down to a perfect calm. The youthful bosom is fast waning its virgin life. The life-love of the eye is burning fainter. The maiden ringlets fair, are comfortless. The lip-smile begins to perish. The voice-melody, to sink in diminuendoes out beyond the human organism, and to symphonize with the ethereal instincts and celestial divinities of song. The senses palsy. The vermilion pencilings of material nature fade into a lustreless pallor. The brow is marble, the cheek alabaster, the lip inflexible as ivory. It no longer reddens and changes, and expressed mirth, and song, and love. Too truly in the fainting maiden is it seen and sung, 
                     "TAKE ME HOME TO DIE."
                  
                
               At the early dawn she passed from life like a beautiful bird of passage, who first sings his departing song, and then on noiseless wings flies away on his joyful, distant, aerial journey to other climes. The younger sister yielded sweetly her life to Him who gave it, and her days on the earth were ended. Ended the sweet voices of her songs. Ended the lovely notes of her harp. Ended her sufferings-earth exchanged for heaven-prayer for praise. 
               During her weary confinement to the sick-room, she frequently sent to Sarah Matilda and Castlereagh kind messages of affectionate remembrance, which they laid up as treasures in their hearts. Human beings seldom suffer more in one brief year than she suffered. So far, it was to every friend she had on earth a cause of thanksgiving and of tear-drops of gratitude, that death came to end the scene, yet mourned they the necessity of such a joy. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               THE GOOD AND THE EVIL INTERTWINE. 
               WHEN the summer term commenced, Henrietta could not return, and Mr. James having but few scholars, thought that with Gertrude's assistance, he might attend to the recitations. Blanche Hayward still rendered assistance with music. The school had fallen away from eighty pupils, many of them large, talented young gentlemen and ladies, to thirty or forty, far younger and less advanced in studies. The long-continued indisposition of Castlereagh brought a blight upon his school that no energy or devotion in others could withstand or relieve. All saw it, all felt it; but there was no other way than to submit to the inevitable fate. Mr. James exerted himself faithfully to secure the remnant of the institution to Castlereagh as a means of solace in his afflictions, and endeavored to buoy him up with the hope of brighter scenes by and by. But the latter knew that he could do no more, and that the vitality of his proud "dream" enterprise was irrecoverably gone. The organic remains were yet visible, but the sarcophagus was ordered, the sepulcher begun. See him. He lately dreamed such a glorious dream of life! Now, having sought at every sacrifice to realize it, lo! the result. He is emaciated, feeble, prematurely old, with awkward and unsteady movement, exciting pity; cadaverous, hollow-cheeked, hollow-eyed, and cane-supported. The boys and girls in their play move cautiously from his path, lest they should stir the breeze too rashly against him, and throw him down. He rests upon a staff, and repays them with a smile. He leans against the flag-staff, and anon climbs the fence, and sits upon it, eyeing the sportive groups around him, or gazing on the inaccessible mountains. By dreams decoyed, by dreams bespoiled, this, this is Castlereagh. But yet he clings to life, or life to him, and something seems to whisper, "fear not." He would again, to-morrow, engage as thoughtlessly as at the first, were this calamity overpast!-No, not with quite the same confidence, but with alacrity and zeal. It would carry him off, to live idly; and if a little better in health, he would regard it as a prohibition to rest. Yet there are teachings in sickness. He who has never been ill, and long ill, dangerously, painfully so, has not enjoyed, in all his good life, the benefits of those teachings which come from our Father on his children, whom he loves! Writhe under them though we may and must, yet are they the heavenly lessons for our good! He who has never been ill, knows little of the tender compassion of friends and neighbors-knows little of his own love of life-little of his great dependence on the Author of his being for every mercy, even the commonest he enjoys. 
                
               Castlereagh was indeed an invalid, faint and weary, but not utterly cast down. 
               It is tiresome to live so; yet thus he lived. The summer was one of interest, activity, and enthusiasm in the family, notwithstanding the sad decline of Castlereagh. Every evening came some one of his beloved people to call on him, yet every evening was he a sufferer, every night bolstered up in a chair, or on his couch, vainly seeking for rest and sleep. How many weary hours of those summer nights he passed, while others softly and soundly slept! Every evening the parlors were filled with the gay and cheerful spirits who, either in the departments of the school and family were associated together, or were intimate friends and acquaintances in Lindenvale. Mr. James took much interest in these circles. Frequently there were present Mr. S. A--, Mr. G--, Mr. O. H--, Mr. R. R. P--, Mr. Z. M--, Misses R. A. --, T. I--, S. M. H--. L. R. -- Hortensia M--, etc., etc., and these with Sarah Matilda frequently among them; Gertrude, Blanche, and her sister Agnes, and Effie; and subsequently Gertrude's young cousin, Miss Catharine Rutherford, her assistant in the school, whose admirable execution of the most intricate and surpassingly beautiful music, charmed every hearer. These were often met together, and Hayden, Wallace, Robert, Jairus, Stella, Cornelia, Johnnie and Hobbie filling in, with a not infrequent call from Castlereagh himself, the company at the parsonage was extremely cheerful, and songs, music from flute and piano, conversation, reading and games, with walks by the moonlight, on the mountain's brow, and along the streams, and fishing parties on the ponds and lakes at twilight and in the evening hours, and merry see-saw sportings on the grounds of the seminary, and rolling of the foot-ball, and swinging in the stout, high swing-these, merry all, constituted a summer scene of happiness and active pleasure seldom surpassed, and one on which the memory fondly lingers. And in these hours thus rolling by, and scenes no more to return, there were often felt the higher emotions and love to God. Even their mirth had in it much of thoughtfulness and reverence; and it led to sacred songs and cheerful friendly intimacies, never degenerating into rudeness causing trouble and sorrowful remembrance. 
               At the opening of the summer term, Gertrude, as we have said, assisted in the female department. The number of pupils was limited. The boarders few. 
               One evening Castlereagh said to Gertrude, "You are looking very pale and weary. You are excessively fatigued or unwell-perhaps both." 
               "I am not very unwell, brother, but I am fatigued. The care of the school-room is new to me, and I have been very much annoyed to-day by two circumstances." 
               "Pray tell me what they were." 
               "The first was the careless spilling of ink by one of the young ladies, which greatly disfigured one of the outline maps, and worse than that was her apparent indifference about it." 
               "Never mind the map, sister. Perhaps you were mistaken about her feelings." 
               "If I could think so it would greatly tend to relieve mine;" and Gertrude with difficulty restrained her tears. 
               "Never mind, never mind, sister; this is a queer world-a-I had almost said a bad world. There is always something in it pushing aside your hopeful dreams, and spoiling many a happy plan. But these trials work off after a time, and do us good. Never mind, never mind, child. What did she do?" 
               "Oh! she said the ink was always spilling, and the map always in the way. She did not even seem to care whether the ink was removed from the desk, or the map cleansed and restored to its place." 
               "What did you say to her?" 
               "I told her that an accident of that kind was half atoned for by consistent behavior and sorrow, and required her to show something of each before I should again grant her any indulgences." 
               "Very well; I can trust you. Now please mention the other trouble?" 
               "The other-was-my own impatience under trials and little annoyances, such as whispering, loud studying, unnecessary shuffling of feet, repeated inquiries for assistance, and leave to do this, and to do that. It seemed to me there never was so much of it before, and that a very small increase of it would drive me crazy." 
               "The annoyances of the school-room are, I well know, constant and grievous; they are very great trials; insurmountable, however, only as we lose the grace of patience." 
               "I think so, myself. But patience is sometimes attacked unawares, and where she had placed greatest confidence, as Hobbie's experiment of melting ice in the tumbler confirms." 
               "How was that?" 
               "You remember how he placed a tumbler, with water frozen in it, on the hot stove in the parlor in order to melt the ice. Directly, however, the glass cracked and fell apart, the water and ice escaped on to the stove, and hissed and steamed away like an engine. His cries brought you and all into the room, you remember, and he threw himself into your arms, wildly, exclaiming, 'Oh! fader, fader! I did n't know it was explosive!'" 
               "Ha! ha! Oh! yes. Little Hobbs, little Hobbs. Well?" 
               "So our patience is sometimes suddenly, unexpectedly surprised." 
               "True. We need great wisdom and care in all that we do. You will, I think, have no difficulty in the management, and you will acquire more fortitude to meet these trials as you longer meet them. And you know that your cousin, Katie Rutherford, will be here to assist you in two or three days." 
                
               "Oh! yes; and every time I think of it, it seems to me I must fly to meet her, and hurry her along." 
               When Miss Rutherford arrived, the young cousins made a division of the time and labor, which very greatly relieved Gertrude, and Castlereagh was delighted at the cheerfulness with which the duties of the school-room were performed by them. 
               Castlereagh having a furlough of six months' release from the cares of his parish, attempted a little work in his garden, short visits to friends, and journeys. 
               Accompanied by Sarah Matilda, he paid a visit to CLIFFORD, in his parish of L--, where he passed a delightful, unforgotten fortnight in June. Too weak for long walks or rambles, he could climb the hillocks and forest-crowned eminences that rose on every side immediately in the vicinity of the beautiful town, taking care to go up without haste. He could fish along the bubbling rivulets for trout. He could pull up the weeds that threatened destruction to the young plants of the garden, and hoe the young potatoes and corn. He also laid out a winding path to the summit of Grove Hill, behind the parsonage, and worked it with his own hands so that even he could climb it without any uneasiness or sinking of his frame. Here he indulged himself freely in quaffing, every day, a large quantity of the pure, soft, spring-water from the hill-side, and in frequent bathings in the same. This fortnight at L-- greatly renovated him, and his flagging spirits revived. The brothers and sisters held a sweet season together, daily communing as only brothers and sisters, long separated, can best appreciate. 
               But there was a painful trial awaiting him. Castlereagh daily resorted to one of the public stores of the place to read the morning paper from the city. One day it happened that as his eye glanced along the columns of the paper, it was arrested by a short, soul oppressing notice. It was to this effect: "DROWNED while bathing, near York, Pennsylvania, where he was engaged as an assistant teacher in Mr. B 's school, Mr. WORTHINGTON IDE MARSHALL, aged twenty-three, a graduate of Yale College, of the class of 1852." Castlereagh at first did not seem to know what he was reading, and re-read the paragraph. He then was conscious of a sort of painful compression of the heart, and began as he read it over and over, to think the name appeared like some one with whom he had been acquainted. By little and little did the whole mystery unfold itself in plain fearful fact, and nearly sinking to the floor, gasping for breath, he moaned, "Gone! also. MARSHALL, the good, the pious, the strong-one whom my soul loved!" Castlereagh, pale with the intenseness of his grief, passed hastily homeward, thinking of that sad mourning sorrow of David, the King of Israel, which led him to exclaim "Oh! Absalom! Absalom! my son! my son!" 
               It was with sorrow inexpressible that the news was announced by him on reaching the parsonage. The surprise and grief of all when it was told them caused a suspension of other conversation and led every one to indulge himself in repeated exclamations of lament at the disaster, and of warm encomium of the departed. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXI. 
               THE WAILING. 
                
                  
                      
                        The drifting tides do wail on the sea 
                        Though they knew he must perish-the strong and the free; 
                        Their white-created billows are a sad signal-token- 
                        Each refluent wave is a dirge of the ocean. 
                     
                   
                
               WHEN Marshall left Lindenvale, he betook himself in the fall to Philadelphia, and entered his name as a student in the celebrated medical university of that city. In the spring he was led to undertake the situation of a teacher in one of the departments of Mr. B 's Sherwood School, at York, Pennsylvania. Here he intended to reside for a few months during the season when there is a suspension of the medical lectures. 
               The labors of the school being over for the day, it was proposed by him and another teacher to accompany the lads of the school to the river to bathe. Desiring Mrs. B. to delay tea for half an hour beyond the usual time, away they all went and proceeded to enjoy their bath. Marshall and his companion were strong and expert swimmers. There is a dam across the river where they were bathing, and they, leaping from it, swam down the stream for a long distance and returned sportively toward the point from whence they had started. 
               "I love the water," shouted Marshall. 
               "Oh! it is magnificent sport," replied the other. 
               "Yes! I used to tell CASTLEREAGH that I was a water-fowl. Ha! ha! Born on the water! ha! ha! Love the sound and smell of it!" 
               "It's royal!" cried the other. 
               "I told him," said Marshall, "I loved to breast the sea-waves, and was at home in the whirpool! ha! ha! ha!" 
               "Look out!" shouted a hoarse voice from the shore. But Marshall heard it not. 
               "There's a strong current here," cried he. 
               "Strike off this way!" replied his companion. 
               "There's an 'under-tow' here!" cried Marshall, breasting the tide that he felt bearing him away. His friend turned to look upon him, and just at the instant saw him struggling; his arms were thrown wildly in the air, his great strength revealing itself for a moment as his form, convulsed with a desperate effort, rose half out of the dark fierce whirlpool into the center of which he had been incautiously and ignorantly drawn. The next moment he disappeared, and one of nature's young braves, one of her noble sons, one of the faithful and promising earth fund a watery death. From that dark whirlpool where MARSHALL died, no one, if by chance engulfed there, ever returned alive. Not long previous to his death, it had drawn in a large boat containing a man and a boy, both of whom perished, and within a short period comparatively, five persons had been lost there. Yet poor Marshall, a stranger, in his ignorance went too near its vortex and perished also, though "born on the wave," fond of the foaming cataract, and the combing sea, the water being his element.
                     See Chap. xii., p.165, and Chap. xxi., p.271.
                   In vain the supper-party tarried his return the desired half-hour; the deep and angry whirlpool claimed his body, and played with it in its dark and treacherous caverns. In three quarters of an hour the lifeless form was cast forth out of them, and anxious, weeping, afflicted friends seizing it from its strange and awful baptism, bore it in murmuring wailings to their home. 
               "Wailing!" Well may they wail. There is wailing in the air, wailing in the deep itself where he perished. The waters wail for their child. There is wailing afar off. wailing in the distant homes, wailing in the MAIDEN'S bosom, wailing in Castlereagh's heart-in Lindenvale; in Yale, at the festival of surviving classmates; in the chambers of the sick; among the good who meet for prayer; among those who roam the forest and climb to the mountains brow. Wailing for those who called him teacher-yonung men and maidens. There is wailing that one such spirit has so meagerly perished. That death should steal upon him so! Yes, there is wailing, bitter, yet unavailing grief. Marshall died in a moment-died in the element he loved, and thought he could control-died he in the fullness of his strength, and the bright opening of his manhood! Let the hearts all wail for him that loved him. He has gone quickly to his last, his cold, his wakeless slumber-and yet! He will awaken at last! 
               Eleanor had returned from the South, where she had been employed as a governess in a family of children; and, having been called to bury her father, was engaged as teacher of an interesting school of young ladies in a neighboring town when this calamity befell her. Sad, drooping, sack--clothed MAIDEN. Go, cast thy sorrow on the Lord, He only can whisper to thee peace. She retired to her home, the true type of sorrow; and, when Castlereagh, long after, saw her, the traceries of a soul-sadness were still on her young features; the sighing of her virgin heart had not been quelled. 
               So it is ever in this waning world. Who is it that has not lost a friend?  
                     
                         
                           "The glories of our mortal state 
                           Are shadows, not substantial things; 
                           There is no armor against fate- 
                           Death lays his icy hands on kings." 
                        
                      
                     SHELLEY. 
                  
                
               Marshall sleeps in the cemetery of his native town, and there, occasionally, wanders the step of a classmate, who visits his grave to lean over it and weep.
                     DAVID OGDEN MOREHOUSE, whom I have here called MARSHALL, was a native of Fairfield, Ct. His life and death, as here detailed in all their important items, are reliable facts.-Author.
                  
                
                
               "Yes," said Castlereagh to his school; "although he died young, suddenly, died where there could be offered him no help, we may conclude the pangs of death were soon over; and that he was prepared, even under the awful manner of his exit to leave this transitory state and appear before God. He died a Christian-a young CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR; and, in eternity, he will be employed in the ceaseless activities of serving, and knowing, and praising God, his Redeemer and Sanctifier." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               ALL SCHOOLDOM AWAKE. 
               RETURNING home to the old scenes with this additional shock to is nerves, Castlereagh was no better. The gentle air he had breathe, and the quiet life he had led, at Clifford's, were now but pleasant memories. He breathed again with an oppressed chest. His fever rose high daily; he cough-oh! that maddening cough!-returned on him; the catarrh annoyed him. Entering his garden the next morning he was sorry to observe that, in his absence, the cow had found her way into the grounds, and had eaten up his young peas and corn, besides trampling down his strawberry-beds. One of his most thrifty young peach-trees had been broken by the boys in their rude play around it. His grape-vine was partly blown down by the wind, and the arbor needed his attention. The weeds were sadly in the ascendant every where. One of the first objects that met his eye was a rude iron knife bent in the form of a scraper, which was hanging in a young plum-tree, just as it had been left there, a long time before, by Marshall. It was an instrument he had fashioned with which to wee out the strawberry-beds. 
                
               The last time he had used it he placed it in the true, where through the storms of winter it had rested, and now rested, undisturbed. This little memorial agitated him sadly, the other circumstances distressed him. Every little trial vexed him. The weather was too hot; the children too mirthful; the school a burden; expenses were enormous; debts were accumulating. His fine, intelligent, numerous school, of from eighty to a hundred pupils, was reduced to thirty. Mr. James, with the assistance of Gertrude and Catherine, had no difficulty in hearing every lesson an class in the school. The old staff of teachers had been swept away by the force of circumstances, oppressing and fatally crippling the proprietor. Mr. James was too friendly and too philosophical to complain. He would have preferred a full seminary of scholars, and those more advanced, but saw the necessity of making, for Castlereagh's sake, the most he could out of the school, and appearing interested. Castlereagh, wandering around his premises, became painfully aware of the change that had taken place, and the great failure that would occur if the effort was continued. Assembling his teachers in his study on Friday evening, he laid before them his intention to close up the seminary as soon as the term should end. There were many tears shed over the unhappy necessity, but all acknowledged that this was the only feasible course open before him. 
               "My life," said Castlereagh, "is in danger." 
                
               "It may be saved," said Mr. James, "if you divest your mind of these cares." 
               "A good ship, in danger of sinking, is sometimes saved by casting overboard the cargo," said Blanche. 
               "A very good idea!" exclaimed all. 
               "It must be immediately done," said Castlereagh. 
               "But how shall we dispose of the Seminary Property?" 
               "Never fear for that," said Sarah Matilda. "How many persons will immediately apply for it when once it is advertised for sale!" 
               With this opinion all seemed to agree, and it was Castlereagh's intention forthwith to divest himself of the great care of his Institution, which now was no longer a pleasing solace in his hours of trial, or a comfort in seasons of self-denial and active labors to do good, but a burden of intolerable weight-an everrecurring theme of anxiety and disquietude. The tides of prosperity were gone. Henceforth the dull subsiding waters of his life's stream would but bear him down. The twilight DREAM had proved itself a dream, and DUTY alone was real. 
               It was announced in the papers, on the same day that the term closed, that the Institution was for sale, in consequence of Mr. Castlereagh's ill heath. 
               We will not describe the closing of the school. Rather let the sympathizing and meditative consider how sadly the soul of Castlereagh was stirred by seeing before him the last remnant of his popular Institute, and, for the last time, undertaking to reward them, and to utter his farewell speech and earnest blessing. Let them imagine, vividly, the great change that must have taken place in him, in the school, in his emotions, and warmest aspirations, and most confident belief at the Dedication of the Institute. Let them dwell on the necessity that compelled him to his present course, and enter into his feelings. They can not otherwise than feel a sorrow in his anguish, and wish to draw over the scene the tender vailing of compassion. 
               So ended the Lindenvale Institute as a seat of high students, the pleasure-seat of literature under the young and enterprising pastor of Lindenvale. Like the sea-tide, it had its rise, its flow, its ebb. Castlereagh could not contend with his own fate. Overborne by a protracted, prolonged, and obstinate sickness, the grand IDEAL of his life passed away from his grasp for ever. The midnight gloom followed the sunlight of his Dream, and Castlereagh felt the iron had entered his soul! PEACE! Let him weep! 
               The key was turned, the massive doors of the Institute were closed, and in a few days, where there had been daily, for several years, clouds of boys and girls passing quickly over the smooth grounds of the school, and where were heard always the gay shoutings of the merry ones-all was hushed-all was still, save the sighing breezes, save the chirping sparrows. And there, wandering alone, leaning on his staff, sadly, mourning, murmuring, leaning against the flag-staff, picking up relics, gazing on the clouds, and weary of the hours of every day, there was the drooping and disappointed Castlereagh. 
               The autumn passed away and winter, yet was not the property transferred to other hands. Castlereagh advertised it extensively, and received immediately letters of inquiry in reference to it. There were made him many personal applications. Not a few letters came to him from distant States, making the most minute inquires on the subject. To each of these letters he gave long and precise answers, and frequently took pains to draw a ground-plan of the buildings and a sketch of the premises. He kept no account of the number of these applications, but they could not have fallen far short of fifty. The most intense disappointment often succeeded to the most confident expectation of a sale, and he became at last truly weary of letters and calls on the subjects. He made excursions, varying in distance from ten miles to an hundred and twenty-five, to fulfill engagements with different persons who proposed to buy of him. But not one of these succeeded. Not a letter of dozens received resulted favorably. Occasionally it happened that a gentleman and his lady came from a distance, and tarried one or two days, conversing about the purchase, with whom Castlereagh found sweet intercourse, and in whose hands he would most cheerfully have confided the interests of his school. Such was the case when his friend T-- and his accomplished lady, of M--, Ohio, came, and were charmed with the place, and prevented from purchasing it only by pecuniary difficulties then pressing at home. But generally these interviews resulted in little pleasure and in less pecuniary profit. 
               There were various objections urged by the applicants: "The sum asked is too great"-"the security is too stringent"-"the buildings are not in the right shape"-"there is too much room"-"it will cost $2000 to put the Institution in order." Some had supposed it distinctly a school-house, and not a residence, and vice vers. Some wanted it for a boarding-school; others for a day-school. Some for boys, and others for girls. A certain class would pay a large rent for the premises, and hire them for a term of years; and various plans and propositions were made sufficient to prove, beyond all controversy, that the real old genuine schoolmaster was abroad. By far the greater part of the persons so making application were too poor to purchase; and giving a long, last, lingering, wishful look at the prize they coveted, turned away, and were heard of no more. Men and women of all ages, fortune, and talents, were aroused and put afloat by the advertisement of Castlereagh Institute for sale. It was generally believed that the proprietor had made himself rich by his enterprise, and that if one could step into his shoes, he would also obtain wealth. But they were careful how they bid on the premises; of the risk they might incur of paying Castlereagh for his work of years and expenses, by which, through advertisements in the papers far and near, by circulars, catalogues, and extensive correspondence, necessary repairs and improvements, he had brought up the Institution from nothing into an immediately-paying one-the would at least insure any scientific and industrious teacher a positive good living income. Yes; they cheapened down the good-will of the Institute to nothing. That they could attend to! You will find there is not a great deal of liberality of feeling toward you, if you have property of this description to work off. And I fancy it is so generally. But all schooldom seemed to shake itself and awaken, to look at this opportunity of investing funds and starting in a new enterprise. The omnibus did a fair business-the post-office paid well-railroad stock advanced-pen, ink and paper were in demand-Hon. and Rev. titles were flush, and also Esqrs., Drs., Capts. Still, the property hung on, and still the advertisements in the larger papers went their weekly round over the whole extent of the United States. Do not flatter yourself that you can dispose that because the schoolmaster is abroad, with his silver-headed cane, he will buy you out the first time he meets you. He earned his money by the square rule, and he will cipher it all out in arithmetical numbers, prove it algebraically, and demonstrate it by the toughest logarithms before he will decide on any risk. Castlereagh had plunged headlong into his enterprise; it involved him mercilessly; and yet it was poor health that cast the deepest shaft in his wounding. He proved to this own satisfaction that is entered on under favorable circumstances as to location, with sufficient funds and good management the boarding-school is no dangerous enterprise. Ordinarily it will pay well. The day-school is less remunerative, far less agreeable. And the boarding-school, to result well in every respect, must be established on an expensive well-furnished plan throughout. It had better cost twenty thousand dollars than five thousand. But, it the country a showy, well-regulated and extensive school may be established at a cost of ten thousand dollars. To many this may seem extravagant. It will not appear so to any one who tried it-to none but tyros. It will be necessary to economize in your expenses to make the ten thousand go as far as you wish it may. This sum, large as it may seem to a certain class of persons, will be refunded in the gross almost immediately; and the net profit is considerable in every case where the Principal and his own family can perform a good share of the instruction. There are few good schools on such a basis as this, where the charges are less then two hundred and fifty dollars for an academic year of forty or forty-four weeks for every pupil. Of course, four of these amount to a thousand dollars; and ten times four are ten times as much, or ten thousand dollars. 
               There is very little difficulty in obtaining scholars, if you have an inviting, extensive, and well-organized school. Failures more frequently arise where, with a thousand or two thousand dollars, and every department crippled correspondingly, one undertakes to engage in the business. He can neither charge conscientiously a generous price for this terms, nor announce boldly to the public his accommodations. Nor can he ordinarily secure other than third or fourth-rate pupils; at least, he can't expect the first class, i. e., intelligent, gentlemanly, well-paying pupils. He therefore, who borrows and pays interest on two thousand dollars, to engage in the matter of a boarding-schools, will frequently still owe the money, when the borrower of ten thousand dollars in a similar enterprise, will have paid it, and become somewhat independent. Still, there must be careful management, and as much of the teaching as possible done in the family of Principal. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXIII 
               THE FOX-HUNT-THE AUCTION, AND OTHER ADVENTURES-LUCY. 
               ACCOMPANIED By Gertrude and Catharine, Castlereagh commenced his annual journey to the North in August. The month was excessively warm and dry. The asthma sorely afflicted, and at times prostrated him to the earth. If he attempted to climb over a wall, or to ascend a small hillock, or a flight of stairs, the effort would often deprive him of all strength, and almost wholly interrupt his power to breathe. The cough would greatly aggravate it, and the expectoration continually weaken and annoy him. Moreover, August is said to be the asthmatic's hardest month. Three hours every night Castlereagh was subject to its tender-mercies, and oft during the hours of the day when others ate, drank, and were merry, he with convulsive effort drew every breath, and leaning on his staff wearily, if from home, sought to gain the hospitable threshold, and apply such remedial agents as could be obtained. Yet what great tenacity we have of life! Although during these paroxysms, he suffered so much that Gertrude and all her friends were very anxious, fearing even the final sundering of the cords of life, and the departure of the spirit itself, no sooner were they past and the convulsive breathing quieted, than he rose up, walked his apartment, entered cheerfully into conversation, and except at times when more than usually weak, was able to ride off over the hills, or wander away with gun in hand long distances in search of adventures. 
               Young Henry one day coming in told Castlereagh, who was then stopping at the BRICK COTTAGE of his brother H--, situated on his retired, rural farm, high up among the clear hills, above the fogs, and jauntingly inclining its green sides to the east and north, the abode of health, happiness and piety-that he had that very morning encountered a fox in the swale while out after the pony. This aroused in Castlereagh the hunter's ambition, and the next morning, with loaded gun, he was on the way to the fox-ground long before sunrise. Stealthily he made his way over the wall. His heart fluttered as he crossed the glen. His eye roved from object to object as he climbed the sods, passed round this bog, leaped upon that, and emerged on harder soil; then threaded the swale. His breathing became hot and sharp as he thought he saw his victim, and waited, stooping behind a log, or gently resting over the edge of a moss-covered boulder till he knew he had been deceived. He examined his "fire-lock;" all was right, and he slowly advanced under cover of every object which the nature of the ground allowed him, till he had gained a position that enabled him to sweep the whole field with his eye without moving away. Here, with a huntsman's heart, a throbbing anxious heart, he watched for sly Reynard, till his whole patience wearied, and he became aware of the danger he incurred of losing his breakfast if he tarried much longer. He accordingly rose up from his crouching posture, took a long bold look through the swale, and then slowly, with trailing careless weapon, gat him along homeward over the sunny side of a smooth hillock where in the winter a fox and her young had been caught by the hunters in her hole. As he passed over the sharp brow of the hill, his eye rested on the very object of his morning's search reposing on the sand about ten or fifteen feet off! Yes, there was Reynard himself! Sly, sleek, waggish Reynard! But he was not caught napping. Oh! no. His eye and Castlereagh's met at the self-same instant, and both made a simultaneous spring. Castlereagh sank instantly to the earth and brought his death-dealing blunderbuss into position. The fox leaped at once six feet from his lair. and swept down the hill with inexpressible activity. In fifteen seconds the parties were no longer in juxtaposition favorable for death or victory, but the advantage lay with Reynard. In the mean time Castlereagh with unsteady eye traversed the barrel of his weapon and pulled at the lock. Why! oh genius of the field! Why! oh envious fortune! Why! oh ye shades of gunnerdom and bog-boots!-why was not that game bagged? Castlereagh pulled valiantly at the trigger of the lock, and wondered why it refused to play. But there it was. In vain the sportsman kept his eye along the gun-barrel on the bounding and cowardly retreating fox. In vain he wished to see the flash, and hear the report, and see the victim fall. Alas! the lock is but half-sprung, and can't go. Was there ever such luck, such another lock, such a painful case? Quick as possible under the circumstances, he brought the lock up to its place, and then followed the flash, the loud report, and-Reynard-was-safe. Himself aware of it, he halted now, turned round, raised one foot in the air approximating to the side of his nose, wagged his tail, smiled a cheerful good-morning, and before the piece was again loaded, was off, and half way to Knowtown, a parish that borders upon Blamstown! 
               After this adventure, Castlereagh declared he would hunt nothing but foxes. He was wont to call the escaped Reynard his fox, and many a morning after that left his couch early to waylay and murder him. But the fox, probably wisely, never showed himself in the swale or glen as long as Castlereagh visited it with powder and gun, greedy for his blood. The disappointed, hunter, in his letters to his friends about this time alluded to the escape of the game in terms far from commendatory of the gun or the animal. He was of the opinion that if the gun had gone off at first he should have secured the fox; and if the fox had been less agitated at his presence, and more disposed to remain where he was, even the slight circumstance of the gun being at half-fire, might have been rectified in season to have made an end of the chase. As for himself, why to have played such an intimate part in this grand fox-hunt was always glory enough, ignoring all his blunders, and the final escape of Reynard. Castlereagh was further wont to say that foxes did not expect to be killed now-a-days, mauger the improvement in fire-arms, because it was an igenious age-an age reflecting as happily on brutes as on rational beings. Formerly one rifle ball would kill any man, now-a-days a whole six-barreled revolver is fired off on one poor victim, and even then he escapes or dies hard. "A man," said Castlereagh, "does not expect to be killed now-a-days under any circumstances. If a train is smashed up, he expects to live through it, although he may get bruised. If a stage, with the Governor of Rhode Island
                     Governor Hoppin
                   and his family inside, in crossing the Alleghanies, is thrown over a precipice, and rolls over and over a hundred feet or more to the bottom of a crazy hill, nobody is killed, not all wounded. Were one to fall from the summit of Bunker Hill Monument, supposing it shaken down by an earthquake, he would expect to survive the fall, receiving here and there a bruise-at most, the fracture of some unimportant limb. And yet, how true is it, that men die every where-die daily-die hourly-and so is it true, that how much soever some foxes (?) may pride themselves on escaping their great destiny, other foxes, not unfrequently are cut off!" 
               Rambling among the hills, sketching the distant landscape, riding here and there, and with his friend C--,
                     J. B. C.--, Esq.
                   perambulating the streets and paths and rural scenes and places of the town, visiting the public baths, library, and places of general interest, as his strength would permit, Castlereagh passed away a few weeks. On his return-way home, he spent a few days with a relation at the delightful town of G--. One day, said M-- to him, "You shall go with me-I have an easy vehicle, the day is peculiarly mild-on a drive out of town, about five miles, where my business as an auctioneer calls me-eh-go?" 
               "Yes," said Castlereagh, "I will attempt it. But what is the auction?" 
               "Oh," he replied, "my old friend, the Rev. S. D--, jun., the talented historian and divine of E--, has been dismissed, and his goods and real estate are to be sold, preparatory to his departure to the West." 
               "Well, that is a piece of news, I confess," replied Castlereagh. "I am truly glad to bear you company. You know I was once acquainted personally with Mr. D--." 
               "To be sure. Well, immediately after we have dined, we will set off." 
                
               "I will be ready." 
               They arrived on the ground in good season, ere many of the "bidders" came after a rapid and most charming ride. Part of the way the road was through a plain, then it ran along a wild embowered stream in a glen, anon wound up the mountain, and over the high-rolling tumuli far up in the clear untainted atmosphere of the green sunny hillocks, and refreshing juxtaposition to the clouds. 
               Perched on the apex of a sharp hill, where the mornings sunlight first seemed to fall, and his last evenings beams to linger, where in the distant south, through a long, peculiar vista of sloping hills and converging forests, one looked down on the meadows bosom of the far-distant, silvery, dazzling river, and surveyed the countless ranges and piles of mountains in the great basin area, and on the east beheld a glorious distant horizon, and on the west grand ranges of everlasting hills, and on the north the same-there stood the venerable old parsonage, erect, aristocratic, parallelogramatic, with its square front, its antique portico, its faded white, its dimmed green on the blinds, its partially-racked gate-way, and fence of rounded and sharpened pickets. Here were the old hospitable parlors, dining-rooms, and kitchen, where for forty or fifty years, the father first, and after him the son, had held the home of a parish priest among the people of these rural glens and hills. And they were true SCHOLASTICS, drifting never on the lee-shore of underdone mind, nor floundering on the quicksands of superficiality and flatulence. All around the house is there the good, old-fashioned, untrameled green lawn, wide for carriage turns, and for the colts and calves, and herd to rove along safe from hateful hoof or horn. And sheds of various size, and hue, and occupancy, ran along from the house to the old brown barn, that held a northern shield against the bleak breezes and tempests. 
               The old home was now to be resigned, the property, in-doors and out, to pass under the hammer of the modern auctioneer, and ere the old line conservatist scholastic lay in his silent house, Young America would plant himself on the rich prairie soils of the West, and serve his generation more according to the age! 
               On the ample grounds around the square old mansion, perched on the hill-top, as we have said, there were spread out the collected utensils of household life, indices of many generations of struggle against an accumulation of domestic luggage! from oldest pattern, raw, unpolished andirons to modern, brazen-top, do.; from cradles antique, and chairs beyond the memory of man, to those in modern vogue; cupboards, wheels, tin-ware, rockers, stoves, desks, shelves, pots and kettles, timeless clocks, and germless seeds; redundant moldy paraphernalia of cellar, garret, closet, and ash-hole, by-place alley, and shelf-loft, brushed with dainty varnish for the occasion, came out into the sunlight on this pleasant day once more, and changed owners once again, gaining new storage for a time.-Poor old TIME-ever thus sadly borne down with past things as well as present! Hard work to the auctioneer made they. Carriages, sleighs, and harnesses, of long gone-by utility, shining in their oily dressing-gowns for the occasion, went off to the very highest bidder-not very tall at that; so went the fine, fat, sleek mooly cow and calf; so the old mare and colt; so went the hay. So the well dried and packed wood; so the corn and fruits growing in the field; so every thing; so the old weather-beaten HOMESTEAD itself-to the highest bidder all. The highest bidder is king at auction! 
               "Gentlemen," said the auctioneer, "we now offer you the house, sheds, barn, and six acres of good land immediately adjoining. They must all be sold. Please make a bid."-The men looked at each other, walked around, sat down, drew out their knives, whittled, smiled, chatted-"How much? What shall I have?-Who bids?"-The people did not seem disposed to hurry.-"Must be sold, gentlemen; now is your time; house, sheds, barn, and six acres of land; what am I offered?"-Bidders rare, profound silence.-"Howmuch, gentlemen!! Don't keep a man talking till night-you know the worth of this good old mansion-now-now;am I offered a bid?" It was hard work. The auctioneer took off his hat, and wiped and rewiped his brow.-"How much!-how much? gentlemen, give us a bid!" 
                
               "Four hundred dollars!" said a short, eary-loking Yankee. 
               "Gentlemen, consider this, will you? I have offered me 'four hundred dollars' for this valuable property. Why, gentlemen, are you beside yourselves? it is worth more money to tear down and move it to Boston! Four hundred dollars!-How much, gentlemen?" 
               "Four hundred twenty!" said a second. 
               "Four hundred twenty! ha! ha! ha! Oh, gentlemen, you have a curious way of running down the price of auction goods out here; never mind-all fair, I 'spose. Four hundred twenty dollars-are you all done? Four-" 
               "Four hundred twenty-five, "said the first bidder. 
               "Thank you, sir; four hundred twenty-five-just the cost of the cellar and foundation-ha! ha! In these days-ha! ha! ha!-Railroad days-how exceedingly low! Four hundred twenty-five dollars-property never in better order. A town here second to none in physical elevation and rural advantages,-" 
               "Four hundred-thank YOU, sir." 
               "Forty!" 
               "Four hundred and forty meager dollars for this delightful 'vale of Avoca,' and hill-top of science and theology." 
               But the hammer came down irrecoverably at four hundred and fifty dollars to the first bidder. No one would go a mill beyond. So the ministerial mansion of both father and son, and six acres of excellent land, found an able purchaser for four hundred and fifty American dollars! After this, were sold a few acres of pasture-land at a spirited price, and the great sale was over. The delicate, intelligent, bright-eyed mother, with a baby in her arms, came to the door. Her husband and rosy-cheeked boys stood beside her. Here was the parting scene with many an old familiar object, a long farewell. Castlereagh rode up to the door, and was introduced. 
               "Here," said he, "are many of your household idols, madam," pointing to the auctioned goods around them. 
               "After all, Mr. Castlereagh," she pleasantly replied, "they are not my real idols. They have neither intelligent nor accountable natures. These are my true idols," said she, embracing her children. "As long as I have these in my care, I can not much grieve for those." 
               "Castlereagh admired her fortitude and faith, and felt for her unmingled respect. Yes, here was the Christian, American mother, of high bred-character, of true, firm principle, of correct learning, intelligence, and refinement, who had been the bright light of this home for many years, who was now parting with its hallowed relics in obedience to the calls of duty that summoned away the pastor from this field of twenty year's labor, to new, distant, and untried scenes; and she could feel that she carried HOME with her, though house and goods were sold, because husband and children, with their love and bright smiles, accompanied her. 
                
               The day's sale must have come a little short of a thousand dollars, and the sacrifice from first cost a thousand. But let them who labor in the Lord, and die in the Lord, take joyfully "the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that in heaven they have a better and an enduring substance." Farewell to the parsonage in E--, farewell to its old ministerial gatherings of fifty years now past and gone. Farewell to the home of good old T--, Pd, D. D.,
                     His light has since gone out on earth.
                   and the younger divine and historian T-- P--, jr. Farewell to the home of all the young Americas in the house-hold; it is henceforth the home ground of bidder No. one at the great auction, and all its new paint, and furniture, and improvements without and around will be dizzen it for a smarter sale by and by, and make good to the buyer the original transaction; as A No.1-fifty per cent stocks, Joint Association, $100,000, capital, "all paid in and secured!" 
               The weather was beyond all precedent hot, dry, and uncomfortable. In a day or two Castlereagh found himself nearing his own home in the Boston Express train. To every body's delight the heavens were overspread with clouds, thunders rumbled loud and long, and a heavy, delicious rain fell on the parched fields and soft, dusty roads. Castlereagh was exceedingly comforted buy this dashing shower and cool moisture, but being dressed only in thin garments, he found directly that he had insensibly contracted a slight cold. 
                
               Sarah Matilda, and Johnnie, and Hobbie, and baby, and Mina, were in raptures at this return with Gertrude, but in the evening Sarah Matilda discovered that he was suffering from the new attack of cold. 
               Perhaps Castlereagh never walked so near the grave as during the subsequent fortnight. The first week of September, through which he now passed, was the most "distressingly warm" and suffocating of the summer. There was no rain, no breeze no frost, no dew, but night and day the heat burned on. Castlereagh lay on his couch, partly sustained by the arms of Sarah Matilda, partly by his pillows, fanned by Gertrude, his temples bathed in camphor, his feet washed by Mina, his children hushed, his friends anxious, and the doctor ever present with his prescriptions, directing the utmost attention and quit. 
               "Oh, what intolerable pain! what insupportable weakness! what a drooping, dying nerveless sensation! can there be any help? Must this be the end? And now am I about to leave you? DREAMS and DUTY, end they here?-end they thus? And all life's REALITIES!" have they their period now? Am I so near the last shore of time that verges on eternity?" 
               Thus trembled the sufferer on his couch, faint, weary, gasping-near the GOAL! But it happened, by the good providence of God, that in a few days the severity of the attack subsided, and Castlereagh was enabled to sit up-by and by to walk his room. And one night there came a sound of rain along the roof, and the rush of wind! Castlereagh rose hastily, threw up the window, high, high! thrust out his face, neck, and arms into it, and inhaling the delicious, cool, moist air, thanked God for the mercy, and wept forth the grateful incense of his soul, inhaling as he wept, and conceiving a new and joyous hope of recovery. So was in that same hour with hundreds and thousands of invalids and sufferers in the land. That blessed rain! That cooling wind! 
               That first whole week in September, 185,-Castlereagh will long hold unforgotten, both on account of his own sufferings during its direful sirocco, and on account of what it wrought for others. It laid his friend Zelotes, in the grave; it cast down the bosom companion of his boyhood-the tall, manly, noble-souled WOOD, and left one of the most beautiful wives a widow, and a most cheerful and intelligent group of children, fatherless. Yes-while Castlereagh lay on his suffering couch, and seemed to be restored by the great goodness of the Lord, his friend was suffering from a raging fever in the city of New York, whither he had gone with his wife for a short visit, and was taken back to Utica-a child of death. "One shall be taken and another left!" Oh! how it chills life's hottest hopes and blocks her ways, to see so many die!-to part with the those you knew once, when all was young and fair-about whom you have hovered and clung through many a year, with only love's warmest emotion-whose hearts can never be replaced! Castlereagh reagh groaned in the bitterness of true grief, when told that his facetious, story-telling, reminiscence-gathering, cheerful, confiding, pious, PRAYING friend, WOOD, had fallen down to rise no more, and was struck with the coincidence of their sickness, at the same period of time, though far apart, and quite unaware of each other's situation. 
               A pleasant memory hovers around the grave of his friend. He was a jovial spirit, a good man, a generous citizen, a believing Christian, and his dying hours were peaceful in the Lord. 
               In due course of time Castlereagh regained his usual strength, and he observed that with the subsidence of the attack, the asthma, which had almost killed him, was gone. A cold, will, it is said, often cure the asthma. His other complaints were not insupportable, but they greatly interfered with the proper attention to his pulpit and to his parochial duties. 
               As soon as he found himself again comfortably well, Castlereagh went to New York, partly that he might consult a physician about his health, and received, in a day or two, the following letter: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           SARAH MATILDA TO HER HUSBAND. 
                           
                              "LINDENVALE, Oct. 10, 185-. 
                              "DEAR ELBERT:
                            
                           "Last evening Mr. James came out and took tea with us. Just as twilight arrived we went through quite a romantic scene at home. I will give you the outlines of the whole story. I was hushing the baby to sleep in the bedroom that leads out of the diningroom, and moving, as I always do, with the utmost caution, lest she should awaken, when suddenly the door swung open, and a woman rushed in exclaiming wildly, 'Save me! save me!' and she threw herself right upon the floor, at my side, the very picture of misery and terror. I perceived also that she was breathing quickly, as though she had been running. I was of course startled, for I concluded she was a crazy woman. Her person was untidy; her hair flying loosely about her, and her whole appearance indicated suffering and poverty. Anxious about the baby, I contrived to lead her out, assuring her that I would befriend her. 'But,' said she; 'they are after me!' 'Who are after you?' I inquired. 'Those dreadful monsters who have claimed my husband and led him away.' I was much agitated as I listened to her and beheld her excitement, and her youthful though miserable appearance. Assuring her of my protection, I led her round into a more retired and dark room, where she immediately concealed herself as well as she could. But how alarmed Mina and Gertrude were, and Matilda, her friend, who happened to be with us, I can not begin to describe. They thought she would murder me, and yet, seeing two men approaching the house rapidly, they barred and locked the door! Coming from the room where the fugitive had concealed herself, I attempted to calm them, but they were beyond measure excited. The men by this time came to the door and rapped loudly for admittance. Sending Mr. James out to consult with them, I informed the girls that the woman was evidently deranged, or excessively frightened, and that I thought she would not harm any one. Mr. James came back now, and informed us that the servant of an official from the Alms House was sent by his superior to obtain possession of the woman as an escaped inmate, and lead her back. That she and her husband had been out of confinement a week, lodging in chambers in the village, and that he was idle, intemperate, and thieving; that he had been complained of again, and the officers had taken him, but that his wife, leaving her two children behind her, had fled from the house, after grappling with the man and nearly strangling him; and, without bonnet or shawl, had fled here. The girls now became greatly interested in her. They stole off to see her, and to speak encouraging words to her As for myself, after learning that the men who were at the door were not the proper officers to demand the fugitive; and, as she had fled to me, and claimed my protection, I told Mr. James that I should not give her up to any one but the proper authority. He, accordingly, went back, and I also went out and spoke to them. The man who claimed her for the overseer said, 'You had better let her go, she's a runaway. I can take her right along, I have, a great many times-fact is, I always gets 'um when I go after 'um.' Thinks I, 'my good sir, we'll see if you do this time.' So I told him the woman had claimed my protection, and nobody should remove her from under my roof except the proper officer! He was terribly excited, and sent the other after the overseer. In the mean time I returned into the house. The woman had come from the bedroom into the dark parlor, and was wringing her hands and weeping bitterly, and exclaiming, 'Alas! alas! my poor babes, my poor babes, my wretched, forlorn husband!' The girls trembled and tried to comfort her. I found, on inquiry, that her husband had been taken to the Alms House in irons, for fear that he would escape, and that, determined, never to return there, she desperately clutched the servant by the throat, and then fled from the house, leaving her children uncared-for behind her. 'And now, there they are, my poor babes, I must go back to them-and then, oh! it is horrible-I must again go within those ugly walls. I who am-alas! what, and who am I?' Mr. James continued to parley with the servant. I found he was convinced that the woman had better be given up. I stoutly refused to listen to it. In about two hours, all which time the smart official at the door kept guard, the principal of the Alms House made his appearance. He spoke to me about the woman, and said 'that she would be taken good care of, and that her husband and children needed her assistance.' Overhearing his voice at the door, and finding there was no further hope of avoiding her fate she gave up the effort, and sulkily followed, down the walk, the men who vented their disturbed feelings in sundry chidings and scoldings; and so she was conveyed once gain to that abode ever detested by its inmates, though it loom up ever so grandly and palace-like before the admiring citizens, more fortunately outside! 
                           "I hear sad news of our poor Josephine Leland Sickles! We knew before that her fine anticipations were far from being realized-but little did I dream of ever seeing her in a condition so painful and revolting. I am going immediately to her friends to inquire about her, and will do every thing in my power to comfort her. 
                           "10 o'clock-I have seen the Summers's, and they, for the fifth time, have listened to their nephew's promises of amendment, and, having obtained permission, have received the family again under their roof! How strange are the developments of Providence around us. Oh, what dreadful havoc of human happiness and thrift has been caused by the fatal cup of intoxication. May the day come, and soon come, when the great sin of intemperance shall be no more. 
                           "Our dear little L-- improves every day of her life. She is now beginning to walk a good deal, and climb into dangerous places, as on the bck of rocking-chairs, and up the washstand. I fear she will yet receive a fall, but we watch her closely, and shall save her if we can. All send you their best love. 
                           
                              "Truly yours, 
                              S. M. C--."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
                
               From September to January Castlereagh almost wholly abandoned his customary duties in his parish, but resumed them in January, and preached nearly every Sabbath-day till the middle of March. During this latter period he was called to attend several dying scenes and funerals. The very aged and beloved Mr. Y--, after a long sickness, was called away, and the old homestead lost one who, for ninety years, had gone out and in across its threshold. 
               Then the fair and delicate mother, Mrs. R--, went to her grave. Castlereagh called to see her the evening of her departure. "How is the sick woman this evening?" he inquired of a good neighbor, a plain man, standing at the gate. 
               "Very low, sir." 
               "Ah!" 
               "Yes, sir; she'll see a change at the tide.
                     Dickens has a fine passage on this popular opinion, in "David Copperfield," in the death-scene of Barkis. The highly dramatic character he has given to the scene is, doubtless, original with him; but it is a very common opinion among out tidesmen and coastwisers, that dying person "go out" with the tide; and the author has here given an actual occurrence of the kind, where the sufferer actually died at twelve, midnight, at low water!
                  
                
               "What o'clock's the tide?" 
               "Ebbs an hour hence." 
               "Why, sir! I hope you don't think she will die then-so soon!" 
               "Not, exactly; but she'll begin then-" 
               "And will die in the morning?" 
                
               "Before new tide, you see, she'll leave us." 
               Castlereagh passed into the house. The dying woman was coughing. She sent word to call in the morning, when she would see him. But she died at midnight, at low tide! 
               The next day-it was winter now-the snow was deep. Castlereagh, on leaving the house of mourning, whither he had gone to converse with the afflicted ones, encountered the joyous, round and red and fair-cheeked boy of the deceased. Too young to know the loss of a mother, he was playing in the banks of snow in high glee! 
               "Is your mother dead?" inquired of him a little, fat, demure, sympathetic child of nature, a girl a little his elder, dressed in a red frock, and carrying a tin pail. "Is your mother dead?" slowly and demurely said she, standing a little out of the path in the snow, over shoes some, and gazing very pitifully on the orphaned boy. "Is your mother dead?" 
               "Yes! she's dead!!" promptly and blithely replied our young urchin, five or six years old, with red cheeks and wide-awake eyes. 
               "When-did-she-die?" slowly and mournfully inquired his interlocutor, standing over shoes in the snow, the picture of sobriety and deep concern. 
               "Died last night!!" cried the boy, as he leaped into a snow bank, and rolled over in delightful fellowship with the free and flaky element, kicking the snow into the air with his heels, and humming a sort of General Green's March to keep time by. 
               Alas! alas! alas! Poor frolicsome lad. Your MOTHER'S dead! She is dead! Did you know that? Poor child. He laughs now; by and by he will weep. His MOTHER'S dead. 
               And hardly had their graves been covered ere there was buried another. The grave was opened to receive the fair young Christian maiden, who, though snatched from life by a complaint that knows no mercy, was supported to life's last curving shore by the presence of the Blessed Comforter and Saviour. Her soul was uncommonly tranquil and confiding. She often repeated the lines of a sweet writer, as expressive of her trust in Jesus:  
                     
                         
                           "Deeper, deeper grow the shadows- 
                           Paler is the glowing West; 
                           Swift the night of death advances- 
                           Will it be the night of rest? 
                           Tarry by me, oh, my Saviour; 
                           Lay my head upon Thy breast. 
                        
                         
                           Feeble, trembling, fainting, dying, 
                           Lord, I put my trust in Thee! 
                           Tarry by me, through the darkness, 
                           While I sleep. Still watch by me 
                           Till the morning-then awake me, 
                           Dearest Lord! to dwell with Thee." 
                        
                      
                     -EVAN. 
                  
                
               Her sleep was the night of rest. Her name, LUCY.

               DISCOURAGEMENT-A SALE-A MARRIAGE AND ITS FINALE. 
               IT was during this winter that Castlereagh experienced the discouragement always more or less connected with a perception of one's low fortune. He found that two years of sickness with all its expenses, and the inability to prosecute any successful business, had thrown him into debt. He aroused himself to meet it as he best could, and vigorously brought his daily expenses into the smallest possible area. But with all his care such were high prices of food, such the expenses of his pulpit, such the necessary cost of fuel, such the accumulations of interest, that he was more distressed in mind than in body, feeble as was his physical state. 
               About this time the windows of kind heaven seemed to be opened just above him, and there came in almost daily, from the hands of his good and generous PEOPLE, heaven's almoners, every needed article, as it seemed, for his family's use. He was no less gratified than surprised at this unlooked-for relief. May a thousand times ten thousand thanks rest on their generous souls! Not satisfied with this, they clothed him and his family a new with appropriate, and even rich, tasteful apparel. They then made him a parish visit with a donation the most generous ever bestowed on him, and continued throughout the whole of the cold dreary winter of 185-, to remember their suffering pastor. When the great day shall come, this that they did for him as the embassador of Christ among them, we doubt not, will be remembered of them. May they all hear the Saviour's voice saying unto them, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." 
               JOURNAL. March 1, 185-. A happy record. A gentleman of piety and character has bought of me the Institute! I have fully completed the trade, and he has taken possession. The interest is no longer accumulating, and eating me up; but is thrown the other way! Yes, interest-money is now in my favor! We are again to hear the ringing of the Institute bell, and to see the happy groups of boys and girls on the grounds so long deserted. 
               What a long, discouraging, dismal, expensive, wearisome time of it I have had, endeavoring to dispose of the Institution! Who could have prophesied it. Well, now we will throw off its perplexing anxiety and see if there be any relief, the burden no longer weighing us down. Lord, help us. Put underneath us thy strength, and we shall be holden up that we fall not. 
                
               
                  March 12.-A marriage! Yes, a cheerful happy bridal in the parlow this very morning. The party consisted of a young and beautiful lady, in the sweet spring-time of her seventeenth or eighteenth year-trustful and calm in her bearing above her years, and shedding a delicious fragrance of smiles on her young and happy lover-bridegroom. Her dress was not particularly costly now showy, but it became her delicate young frame, and she appeared a bright fair bird alighted on earth from the shining skies. The happy bridegroom was a small, delicate-framed youth, very slender, very dark-haired, very heavily-shaded lineaments, a keen, intelligent eye, and a winning, pleasant smile. His dress was perfectly neat, and his deportment easy and frank. They alighted from a handsome carriage drawn by two grays, and were accompanied by a fine-looking, cheerful, full-cheeked young man as groomsman, and a handsome young lady-friend as bridesmaid. 
               Sarah Matilda, with Johnnie and the baby-child happened to be absent at the time making a visit home. There were at the bridal, therefore, besides the parties mentioned, Castlereagh, Gertrude, Mina, and Hobbs. The morning was a little damp, a slight snow lay on the ground. The bridal party being ushered in, were accosted by Castlereagh, (who having seen the genetlemen the evening previous, was prepared for the arrival,) and were asked if the ceremony should immediately proceed. Receiving their assent, the marriage riage rites were about to commence, when the groomsman observed to the bridegroom that he was standing on the wrong side of the bride. He smiled at this, and said it made "no difference." The groomsman smiled too, but insisted that it was "our of order." 
               "Never mind, never mind," said the bridegroom. 
               "But you shall change," he answered. So he playfully but firmly took hold of him, and placed him on the right of the lady, who along with her companion, smiled at the gentlemen's passage with each other on the point of order. 
               They were soon bound together by the firm cord of matrimony-"What God hath joined let no man put asunder." 
               Before leaving, the bridegroom requested of Castlereagh, that for the present, the marriage should not be made public. 
               "You would not have me write a notice of it for the papers?" 
               "No! sir-no! sir, if you please," he quickly replied. Castlereagh bowed, and said, 
               "As you please, sir." 
               The party directly left, sauntering easily down the walk to their carriage, and drove back to the city. Happy, happy youthful lovers! may you have a long and tender life of married joy!
                     Six weeks expired, and this happy bridegroom was shot in his own parlor, in the presence of his youthful bride, by a former suitor of the lady, and fell mortally wounded. Three days of agony passed away, and he expired. Thus end of times our youthful "DREAMS."
                  
                   
                  
                      
                        "Domestic happiness, thou only bliss 
                        Of Paradise that has survived the Fall! 
                        thou art the nurse of virtue." 
                     
                  
                
               
                  March 15.-Johnnie is engaged in the study of Railroad Guides. Also the routes, names and places of railroads on the great map. He would study till ten and eleven o'clock every evening, if we would allow of it. He seems to have acquired the whole of this science. He knows every railroad, I fancy, in the United States, every principal stopping-place, how long it takes to reach Buffalo, Cleaveland, FREMONT, where his uncles, aunts, and cousins live, Toledo, Chicago, Rock Island, Cincinnati, etc., etc., in those directions; COLUMBIA, S. C., in that; Boston, Portland, in that; Burlington and Montreal, in that. He bids fair to be a railroad man, I think. He and Hobbs are much pleased with the little fat DUTCHMAN, who smokes his pipe, and attends so faithfully to the switching off and on fifty or eighty locomotives daily, at the foot of the Harlem Tunnel, New York. 
               Hobbs in learning to read. It is rather hard work; but he gains upon it. He will run like a deer. He is also a railroad man, and expects to be an engineer. Not long since, he was sick a day or two, and took medicine. 
               "Father!" says he, "do you like to be sick?" 
               Having had a two years' trial of it, I answered without any hesitation, in the negative. The boy was reposing in a convalescent state, on his mother's bed- 
                
               "No, Hobbie; I can't say I love to be sick." 
               "I do, father, I like to be sick for three reasons." 
               "You do! Well, let's have them." 
               "Because I can have RHUBARB, EGGS, and TEA!" 
               "Ha! ha! ha! Hobbie, you have made out quite a case." 
               The boy has always had a passion for tincture of rhubarb with paregoric, and a great desire for tea and eggs; and as odd as the compound may seem, I really imagine he would, at any time, make a delicious breakfast of it! 
               One of our good neighbors, Mr. P--, visited England in November to see his father and friends. He returned in January. We were speaking of his return Saturday evening. The next morning I was late getting away to church, and the bell was tolling. I hurried out, shut the door after me, and was making off-when the earnest voice of Hobbie, "Father! father!" called me back. 
               "Well!-speak out-what, my son?" 
               "Only this, father; did Mr. P-- go to Africa?" 
               "Whe-w-w-! Shut, shut the door: Africa?-" Poor Hobbs! Little idea has he of the relative positions of the islands and continents of the globe. He has heard of Africa, America, Europe; but where they are-how near-how distant-there's the rub. 
               Johnnie and Hobbie have been very busy of late with their scissors clipping pictures from Gleason's
                   
                  Pictorial, and from other papers that I have given them; and they have pasted them with their small brushes into their scrap-books. I explained to Hobbs the picture in Gleason, that represents SIMS taken by the police to the wharf to be shipped off. 
               "Father," says he, "I think they must have a pretty much police in Boston; don't you?" 
               Having found in the Pictorial a sketch representing the dashing equestrian performances of Madame L-- from Paris, at Niblo's, he requested me to read to him what was said of it; I complied. He then called the attention of his mother to it, who after examining the sketch for a moment, cast it away, saying: 
               "Fie! I would not be there, and do as she does, if I could. I should prefer to do and be something more useful." 
               But Hobbie exclaimed- 
               "Oh! father, ain't it funny that she came clear over here just to do that!" 
               I have often noticed that children have correct ideas on many matters that seem beyond their comprehension, and without the circle of their direct observation or experience. What could be more to the point than Hobbie's phrase, "JUST TO DO THAT!" 
               We once sent John and Hobbs to the hill, where they had been sliding, to find the latter's handkerchief. 
               "Did you find it, Johnnie?" 
               "No, sir; we looked all round, and could not see it." 
               "Well, I am very sorry, indeed," said their mother. 
                
               "Father," said Hobbie, "I e'en a'most found it." 
               "'E'en a'most found it,' how so?" 
               "Why, I was looking, and I saw a red sort of a thing by a stick, and run to it, thinking it was it-but it wasn't! I e'en a'most found it, though, did n't I? and wouldn't you be glad, father, if I had!! Yes, sir, I guess you would!" 
               
                  April.-We are still making plans for our new house! Sarah Matilda drew a very desirable one the other evening. It combines taste with convenience and abundant room for all our family. It is, if any thing, rather too large, especially too expensive. What a world of pleasure this has given us, although as yet, it is, literally speaking, building houses in the air. 
               Mina is always encouraging me. The other day, when I was complaining that medicine seemed to do me no good whatever, she answered, "You must not expect to receive good from medicine while taking it, but just after you quit it." 
               "Ha! ha! Mina, is that the case?" 
               "True, an it is, sir. Many's the one who thinks his medicine must do him good right off, when he takes it. No, no, that's not the way-but just after he quits it." 
               "Ha! ha! ha! a fine comment on drugs, surely. Then, if I keep on in this way a year or two, and stop, I shall begin immediately to feel the benefit!" 
               "Yes, sir; to be sure-just after you quit it." 
               This is a new idea; it may be a true one.

               CASTLEREAGH TO ALICE. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "LINDENVALE, April, 185-. 
                              "DEAR MADAM-
                            
                           "In your letter of the 10th inst.-for which, I trust, I am as ever duly registered in your books as 'the grateful E. Castlereagh,' you say, 'All that I wish to visit England for, is to see Ireland and Wales.' At first, I thought the remark one of your extremely facetious sayings, and I tried to lay it by. Still, it would rise every half hour to my recollection with fresh interest, and I came at last to regard the idea as a reasonable and comprehensive conception of a trans-Atlantic excursion. We have now weekly news from London, Liverpool, Birmingham, etc. We have read 'Guide' after 'Guide' to all the environs of the great city of its lions. We feel, i. e., I feel acquainted with London and with much of its surrounding country; but of Wales and of Ireland I know just enough to throw around them, their mountains, rivers, lakes, cities, towns, counties, parishes, bogs, fields and meadows-their noblemen, their common people, their customs, their castles, cottages and hedges, an indescribable charm like that of the best story of romance. 
                           "Of Wales I know less than of Ireland. Her written history, however, is to a certain degree accessible; and her people have a name in it, and in the world, for piety, nobility, valor, poetry and eloquence. 
                           "Look at Ireland. What multitudes of her children have come over the seas to America! Would God They were all truly Evangelized, Bible-taught men and women! May they yet become truly Americanized-lovers, if not of their own country less, of our country more. 
                           "I have already spoken for a bright little cottage under the shade of the baronial castle of my friends, the N--s, in one of the thousand pleasant retired estates of England, whenever, by the Court of Chancery, they shall be put in possession of their lawful rights. And then I will take many a trip over the channel, into the Emerald Isle, to learn more than I now can of its strange, eccentric, and thrilling history. To these strangers, dwelling among us, I am indebted for many an interesting story of Ireland's people in their exodus to America, and for about all of my familiar, local ideas of their home and country. Almost every one of them has something new and racy to say of himself in particular, and of Ireland in general. Mina has lived with us more than six years, and it is but a little more than this she has been in the country. She reached America in the goodly packet-ship --, from Liverpool to New York, in the spicy time of ten weeks! How many times, through her, have I not heard of Lord FORBES (pronounced by her, Forbus); gallant Lord Forbes! rich Lord Forbes! dashing Lord Forbes!-of the 'domain' of Lord Forbes-and of Lord Forbes' young and noble son, the gallant Earl GLENARD, just come into his inheritance that had been, during his minority, encumbered with his father's debts? How extensive in his domain. How fond is he of the chase. See him, and those dashing blades his companions, coursing through the park! And there in Mr. O'Mootey's estate of Brientown, that comes up to Lord Forbes' domain; and the people say they ought to make a reunion in the families, and bring them into one estate. Lord Forbes and Mr. O'Mootey had each a brother killed at Waterloo-General Hayson Forbes, and Captain O'Mootey. And did not O'Mootey tell her grandfather that he was longer a resident in the country than the Forbes'? The O'Mooteys came out in the last part of Elizabeth's reign, and the Forbes' in the reign of James. Is not that a good spice of history to give relish to my Irish visit across the Channel? And do you not see the Forbes and O'Mootey domains bordering each other, where the rich proprietors have held sway so long, and in whose lordly castles hang the portraits of a line of noble ancestors? And here flows, by the cottage of her mother, the noble river of Ireland, the SHANNON, with its lakes, and coves, and armlets; its green meadows and flowery bogs spreading out before the eye, a most captivating and varying lanscape. Do I not know the whereabouts of ROSSCOMMON county, and its post-office, RUSKY? Of LONGFORD, the county town of Longford county? And there is Father O'Brien, whom all the faithful love; and Rector Crawford, the Episcopal clergyman who married the noble Forbes and his lady. And what a rich and splendid mansion is that of Mr. Verse Koyle Crawford, facing Lord Forbes' domain. See him weeping when the Lord Forbes dies! 
                           "Ah! how many letters have Sarah Matilda and I directed to those who have been left behind, containing one, two, and three pounds, in bills of exchange, to help 'the dear heart, alive;' there-to help them over to America-or to help them stay where they now are? And these letters, have they not gone to 'Rusky Post-office?' Have we not many an acquaintance and friend in those parts on account of those things?-Were we to visit Ireland to-morrow-we who never saw one of their faces, should we not find there many a home and friend-many a one, by whom, for Mina's sake, we should be cheered with Ireland's own earnest greeting, 'WELCOME HOME?' 
                           "It was but yesterday she received a long letter from her only remaining sister in that country-a married sister who knows all about Mr. Castlereagh; his business, his family. She now inquires after his health, and sends over several valuable recipes to cure him of his maladies, such as flax-seed tea and mustard-plasters. Here follows a portion of her letter on the subject. 'I am very sorry to hear of your good master that he is in bad health. May the Lord restore him again to his health, if it be the will of the Lord. You said they would remove for the good of his health. I know it pains you to the heart to part with so good a family. Since I heard of it, I make the little children pray for him. I know that this gentleman has medical aid, but if he would try some flax-seed tea, by putting the flax-seed in a tea-pot and pouring boiling water on it, and drinking it, and put a plaster of dragon's blood (!) on his chest, and between his shoulders, it would do him good, with the help of the Lord; for Christy had like to die almost, twelve months ago-he had the worst cough that ever I heard, and that is what done him good, after trying all the doctors.' 
                           "Now this is true kindness and sympathy. Think too of her little family of Irish children, away over there in the shadow of Forbes Castle, praying for the health of Castlereagh!
                            
                           "See the beautiful GROUSE, feathered down to the feet, glossy, rich, fluttering over, and making their nests in the heather, with its beauteous little pink-blossoms; and the heather grows every where, on the moors and bogs. 
                           "Oh, that you would take your pen and write the
                               story of this great exodus! What a thrilling story it? Who can write it-the breaking of their homes, the parting of kindred, the long, long weary tempestuous voyages; the arrival in a strange land-the shifting each one for himself-the finding of, and the loss of friends-the disappointment, the hardships endured-the sickness, destitution, suffering and death experienced. Who, I say, can write it? and yet it is a veritable story of our own day in this age of the Christian era. And still they come-still are vessels daily floating to their docks, in the New World, with fresh importations of this great, this wonderful emigration. 
                           "Pardon me this long episode. Your own remark must be charged with it. When you go abroad, fail not to visit Newtown Forbes, nor to see the O'Mooteys' and Forbes' domains; nor to inquire for letters at 'Rusky Post-Office, county of Roscommon.' Go see the Shannon, and find the little children who daily pray that life and health may be to us the boon of heaven. 
                           
                              Yours, in haste,

                              "LINDENVALE, May, 185-. 
                              "N. P. W., Esq.
                            
                           "DEAR SIR:-My eyes have eagerly searched for every thing from your pen since I read your letters to invalids last autumn. And I have in common with many others, regarded you as one of the file leaders in the great Forlorn Hope of Consumptives. It gave me great concern of mind last winter to read of you as becoming weaker, and despairing of recovery, and a great and happy reaction, more recently, to read of your positive improvement. Do, sir, permit me to congratulate you on this hopeful condition of your health-and not only for yourself, but for all that oppressed multitude who look at you with the most intense solicitude, it being certain to them that, if with all your energy, activity, and faithful effort, the fatal tendency is not checked and overcome, then they must yield to an agonizing necessity and despair of recovery. May your success save them from this if possible. 
                           "My own case has in it nothing very distinctive from most other invalids of this sort. I have been two years a sufferer, having lost my health under the pressure of circumstances detailed in these 'Dreams and Realities.' I am now busily at work to repair it, but the improvement is very slow. Yet at times I seem to spring up a little, and to gather hope. I was very imprudent with myself both when health was good, and when it began to fail. In resorting to remedial agents, perhaps more imprudent still. 
                           "I have amused myself in looking over the long list of medicines that I have run up by little and little, as the tapster exhausts his beer! 'Amused?' yes; and vexed-ashamed. I have uniformly said to every one who inquired of me, 'I take very little medicine, sir.' But I will give you a list which is perfect only as far as it goes, how much further it might be extended, I do not pretend to say. Of this I am satisfied, that so long as quackery usurps the place of intelligent medical practice, so long will consumption frightfully prevail. Consider this alarming fact in the following connections. First: the patent nostrums and panaceas are unblushingly sold AS positive cures of consumption. Secondly; it is boldly declared that the best medical treatment in the world can do nothing to relieve this disease. Thirdly; it is a fact that the community have lost much confidence in the regular practice of physicians in such cases, and as a consequence, have fled to quackery! The invalid buys his panacea and sips it, neglecting to make his case known to a physician, until on his dying couch, when alarmed, disappointed, and ruined, he sends for one who arrives in time only to dress him appropriately for the grave! My own opinion is that the regular physician is now, and ever has been, more worthy of confidence than the quack! In this saying, I include EVERY ORDER of intelligent practice among the profession, and I can but embrace the conviction that were the invalid seasonably to return from his eager chase of universal panaceas to the kind, consistent, and intelligent care of a discriminating physician, and his helper, the faithful nurse, it would be well for him. The error may have been, in respect to the regular practice, that it was too much relied on. Now, I am sure it is in this, that it is too little trusted. And again, I think that less medicine, and a bolder effort at physical hardihood, hydropathy in due proportions portions, and a plain, though generous diet, with much exposure to the external atmosphere, will invigorate and restore when a careful following of medicinal practice may have no good effect. We rejoice to learn that you have derived so much benefit from your system of earnest exertion. May your life yet throw forth a lengthened and a goodly shadow. 
                           "The 'little' medicine I have taken, and manner of practice pursued may be gathered from what follows: I tell the story partly for the sake of those pale, feeble-limbed, fleshless folk, component parts of the great distinguished corps of invalids, whose disease, if it be a fatal one, is honorable to physical nature in that it is concentrated at and around the truly vital and organic regions of the air and blood in the human subject. I tell the tale partly for their benefit, for they may idly enough be dreaming that they also take but 'little medicine!' 
                           "In the belief that my complaint was not a serious and permanent one, I first supplied myself with liquorice in two kinds, and with medicated candies and confectionary. I purchased all the cough-candies that came up, and carried something of the kind in my vest pockets daily. But the disease did not yield at all. I then procured me a box of vegetable pills, and tried their effect; subsequently I purchased Lees's pills; after this made use of anti-dyspeptic pills, tonic pills, vegetable pills, hygeian pills, numbers 1 and 2, cough pills, cathartic pills, etc. I made use of stimulants, tonics, and narcotics. One good physician gave me a bottle of Malaga wine and bark; another advised Port wine and iron; small beer, ale, and porter another believed would help me; cider, for the carbon was recommended, alcohol to bathe in, brandy, at nine dollars a gallon, it was thought would be good. Then I was told to use wine, native grape, Catawba and Isabella, currant wine, and elderberry wine, and the best wines of commerce! 
                           "I know not how many decoctions of everlasting, rue, birch, cherry-bark, pine and winter-green, and sassafras, combined with due proportions of true saccharine, and brandy or wine as pleasant beverages, I have for more than two years been receiving at the hands of my lady-parishioners-good souls, Heaven's own blessing on them!-who sent it to me in bottles and large tin pails. They were determined I should get well. 
                           "I have made a free use of tincture of rhubarb, elixir paregoric, elixir asthmatic, Seidlitz powders, Dover's powders, More's powders, castor-oil, lemon and onion as a syrup. At one time I fancied the ONION was about to cure me. I made a free use of it in various forms of preparation-as food, as a syrup, as a poultice. I still think it benefited me. To relieve my cough I have resorted to vinegar, thickened with sugar and honey, seasoned with lemon, and have used a wash for the head, of mint and alcohol, to check the catarrh. I have made a tea of the root of the delicate waterbugle bugle, and have brought out an extensive and smarting eruption on the chest with croton-oil. The mustang, pulmonary, and volatile liniments have been applied externally to my throat, and caustics internally, and gargles of nitrate of silver, catechu, and a decoction of white oak bark. Bread and mustard poultices, hot toasted bread, and even hot flat-irons and smart frictions by rubbing with flannel, anon cold-water bandages, liniment, camphor, pain-killer, etc., etc., have been the treatment of the chest, externally, when oppressed with pain. The inhaling tube, the inhaling fluid, the gymnasia of the arms, and various methods of inflating the lungs and relieving them by expanding-the treatment more appropriately belonging to the chest, internally. 
                           "But the complaint not yet being wholly routed, I must needs purchase Blackman's Genuine Healing Balsam and Salve, alias a sticking-plaster, against which I have always had a just spite, since in my honey-moon itself! my wife advised me, for a pain in my side, to put on, at night, a poor man's plaster, which I did, supposing it would slide off as easily as a glove in the morning. But that plaster clung to me for a month, and when, by our united skill and strength, it was finally removed, with it went about all my power to endure suffering. I could have wept at every step of the progress we made in the case. So I have always preferred to die rather than use a plaster-a regular sticking-plaster. The balsam was not very injurious- two to four drops being called a dose! One of my young friends declared, however, that with perfect impunity he had taken two spoonfuls of it at a time. This you will hardly believe. I also purchased a bottle of cherry pulmonic, a bottle of nervine, and a bottle of pulmonary balsam. With these I made use of balsam copaiva! and an alterative mixture, wine, and tonics. 
                           "To cod-liver oil I am an utter stranger, though it has been often recommended and even urged upon me. Not so with LOBELIA. I have found that the tincture or syrup of lobelia would relieve the pressure from the lungs, by clearing away the mucus and heavy secretions from the throat. Better than this are the buds of the plant, as found in the field. One or two of these will often entirely check my cough and nauseating, set me into a quiet sleep. So I have taken, and still take, a few drops of 'No. 3,' in water, and never fail of relief from it. I think the lobelia, therefore, does really act favorably in throat diseases. I think the same of Ayres's Cherry Pectoral, etc. 
                           "Madame Porter's medicines, Doctor True's celebrated German Cough Syrup, Davis's 'Pain-Killer,' Beers's Cherry Mead, iodide potass, etc., tincture bloodroot, gold thread, motherwort, thoroughwort, alias bone-setter, ginger-tea, cinnamon and clove-tea, sage-tea. These have contributed of their inherent, excellent qualities to the service of other medicines in the work attempted. 
                            
                           "I have tried a 'little' the 'tar' cure, as you have seen already. Besides what I have mentioned, let me not overlook a gummy and really wholesome preparation of this sort by a plain man, and a good personal friend, who, having all faith in it, made me repeated presentations of the compound, never accepting a penny for his trouble, and who, I verily believe-for such is his goodness of heart-would make it every week for me, ten consecutive years, if it would do me any sort of good. I have, when troubled with difficult respiration, made use of brown pack-paper, i. e., tarred rope paper, saturated highly in saltpeter-water, and smoked it, when dry, like a cigar. 
                           "I have had the delicate, sweet little pills, i. e., pellets and powders of Homeopathy, and her tiny phials of phosphorus. I have enjoyed the cold and warm, fresh and salt bathings of Hydropathy. Have eaten Grahambread, and beveraged on water-gruel. Have worn shoulder-braces, thickly-wadded stomachers, and spring-supporters-and the wonder is, perhaps, that I am still alive! 
                           "What say you? Is this natural? Is this hopeful? Is this congenial to human life, and freedom, and happiness? I have given up all business, excepting ever this great, stupendous matter of taking 'a little' medicine for my health! What say you of my chance for it? 
                           "I have noticed that persons with consumptive diseases are ashamed of them. I have hardly met with an exception. A consumption is called 'a cough,' 'a cold,' 'a throat disease,' 'a bronchial difficulty,' 'a catarrhal disorder,' 'a pulmonary tendency,' 'a pain in the chest,' 'a weakness of the lungs,' 'a tendency to secretion,' 'profuse expectoration,' 'an attack of asthma,' 'a weakness and loss of strength.'" 
                           "The victim of consumption carries around with him into society for a long time, often, his pale, wan, or unnaturally flushed face, and holds out his card of health to every body. He suspiciously conjectures that every one who meets him, notices his peculiar disorder in his features, and makes remarks at his leisure, the general aim of which is to show that 'he is dying of the consumption!' Now, a man with a disordered, unhealthy system, whose heart, blood, liver, stomach, are diseased, whose nerves are disordered, in whom a preparation is going on for a fever, or paralysis that will crush him in a week, goes cheerily forth, imbibes his ale, smokes his cigar, guides with a strong hand his fiery bays, toiletes for the gay parlor, or dance, and every one says of him, 'what a fine specimen of health and long life!' Alas! the poor, pale, unstrung, coughing pulmonaryist may outlive him years; but shame on his disease, he can not hide it! 
                           "These are men, my dear sir, who have hard work to live. I know of none who work harder than they for this object. And they rejoice that you who have roamed by sea and land, above ground and under ground, and sought the aid of different climes, and of various medical treatment, and of much personal labor, exposure, and exercise, have so much reason to believe the 'pulmonary tendency' is in your case, turned aside. God only knows how heartily I join with them, and sympathize with you, though a stranger, in your joy of health. For myself, I ask no greater earthly boon than this; but the coming of it lingers. It was a happy saying of Mina's, I believe, that one must not look for any good in medicine 'while taking it, but just after he quits it.' Were I to become a true convert to this opinion, what might not be anticipated as the result of abandoning even the 'little' medicines that I have hitherto employed? 
                           
                              "Yours, etc., etc., 
                              "E. CASTLEREAGH."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               With this letter, Castlereagh brought his writings to an end. He had dreamed, and toiled, and suffered. But none could know his sufferings. They were his own experience, and through them he gazed back on the past, now noting here, and anon there, some duty undertaken that cost him dear, but over which he could not sigh, for he had been blessed even in his trials. 
               The DREAM of that twilight hour, remembered still, long, long ago had been demonstrated, but a dream. And yet, his life of DUTY, Castlereagh ascribed to its potent charm. And where is he who has not builded on dreams, or airy castles, many a stern plan of life, and pushed it forward, often even in the paths of cruel trials and hardships? But it is over our life of suffering we bend with truest approbation. And Castlereagh, when he left his home and native land for health, bade Sarah Matilda, if she wept him dead, weep that he had done so little well, and improved no better the angel visits of sorrow! 
             
            THE END.
