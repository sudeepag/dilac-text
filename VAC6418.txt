               CHAPTER I. 
               "THERE is the baby again-always sure to awake just as I am in the greatest hurry-how provoking!" 
               "Patience, patience, wife," exclaimed Mr. Langley, who had entered just in time to hear this burst of motherly eloquence escape his wife's lips. "See here," he continued; "I have brought you a nice little hand-maiden, who is to serve you in the capacity of nurse, cook, or waiting-maid, just as your fancy chooses." 
               "Yes, and I dare say she will be a greater plague than profit," sharply responded the irritated wife, as she lifted the baby from its low cradle, and strove to quiet its screams by the natural process usually resorted to in such emergencies. Baby's screams were soon stifled, and Mrs. Langely deigned to look upon the little orphan girl, whom her husband had just introduced. What were her cogitations while scrutinizing the pale, diminutive object before her, we will not attempt to decypher. It might be that she was calculating the profit to be derived from her twelve years of service, after deducting the amount of plague to be endured; or, that she was deliberating ating whether it was, indeed, a living, breathing, human being, which stood before her, or only a marble statue. 
               "Well, Rebecca, what do you think of her, on the whole?" inquired Mr. Langley, bursting into a great laugh, for he had been closely watching the play of his wife's countenance while regarding the child, and had seen expressed therein almost every emotion that the human soul is susceptible of feeling; nor is it surprising, for the poor child did present a strangely anomalous figure. Her face was pale and emaciated-wearing that unearthly hue which usually characterizes the victims of agues and fevers. A stupid wildness glared in her large, dark eyes, while her form was so much distorted by what is commonly termed an ague-cake, that she bore no resemblance to anything within the imagination of man, unless it be to some of those attractive fancy sketches which adorn the flaunting train of Harper. 
               "Better ask what I think of you," tartly responded the wife. 
               "Well, then, what is your august opinion of me, or of us both, compounded?" 
               "That you have lost your wits, if, indeed, you ever had any. I am sure I have quite enough trouble with this cross baby, without having other people's children to nurse." 
               "Never mind, wife, I guess she will soon be able to help you take care of the baby; Mrs. Dennis says she has now missed the ague three days." 
               "Help take care of the baby! are you crazy, to think I would trust my Lizzie with that child? Why the sight of her would frighten her into fits. I think you had better make up your mind to take care of her." 
                
               "Well, well, if she is a little trouble at first, I feel pretty confident of getting paid in the end." 
               "I should like to know where the pay is to come from, unless you intend to set her up for a scare-crow; and I think that is the best disposition you can make of her. And I'll warrant that that poor, sickly, helpless thing is to have a finer setting-out when she becomes of age, than I had when I commenced house-keeping." 
               "Never you mind, I know my own business a little better than you do. You seem to have forgotten that that poor, sickly, shapeless thing, as you call her, is sole heir to a very snug estate and that I am her guardian," rejoined Mr. Langley somewhat sharply, evidently nettled at his wife's persistency. 
               "Some new speculation, I'll warrant," soliloquized the wife, in a half audible tone; but then came the thought that her husband's speculations, from his first investment in old iron, to the present time, had been remarkably successful, and so she was silent and submissive to his will, naturally concluding that a lawyer ought to know much better than she did. Yet she would rather have had the profit without the plague, for her acquisitiveness greatly overbalanced her benevolent organization. 
               "Do you think you can tend the baby?" said Mrs. Langley, suddenly fixing her sharp, penetrating eyes upon the child, who sat stupidly gazing at the different objects in the room, without manifesting any particular interest or delight in her silent observations. In fact, she had suffered till mind and body had become nearly paralyzed; and perhaps it were better for the poor orphan, that she had been introduced into her home in this weak and morbid state of mind, else this sudden transition from the warm, genial atmosphere of love and sympathy, to the icy regions of grasping, sordid, calculating, money-worshipers, would have been a severer trial to her young and sensitive heart. 
               The child raised her dreamy eyes to the questioner, but made no reply, evidently not comprehending the meaning of her words. 
               "Why don't you speak; have you lost your tongue?" 
               "Don't know," was faintly ejaculated by the breathing statue. 
               "Don't know what-whether you have lost your tongue or can tend the baby?" and the lady's hard visage was overwhelmed with a rude apology for a sarcastic smile. 
               "Better let the child have a few days to recover her strength before setting her to work," interposed Mr. Langley, "for Mrs. Dennis says she has been very sick-so low that she had been obliged to watch over her night and day for a long time, and at times thought she could not possibly recover; and the old lady cautioned me repeatedly, to be careful not to let her take cold. She seemed much attached to her, and was loth to give her up." 
               "I'd like to know what that old woman wanted with her, she can't take care of herself, for it's only a few days since she was here to get some meal; she said the child thought she could eat some mush, but I guess she has fed beggars till she has nothing to eat herself." 
               "Did you let her have it?" 
                
               "No, I won't encourage borrowers, nor beggars, either." 
               "It was rather hard to refuse her in such a case." 
               "Let her use her charity at home then, there is no need for her to be running about town, hunting up the sick to take care of better take care of Number One first." 
               "That is a very amiable quality, you must admit." 
               "And well qualified to keep her poor." 
               "That is true; but she seems to enjoy it, for she always looks happy and contented." 
               "Yes, I suppose she would be happy if she had only a crust and a bone; some folks never think about laying up any thing for old age. I wonder who she expects will take care of her!" 
               "Somebody will have it to do, no doubt." 
               "Well, it won't be me," said the lady, giving the cradle a vigorous jerk toward her, as emphatic of what she said; and depositing the infant in its bed, she ordered the little orphan to rock it, and take good care not to let it waken. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER II. 
               THE events narrated in the preceding chapter, took place some thirty-five or forty years ago, in the youthful, but thriving city of Cincinnati. A city whose name has now become familiar throughout the civilized world, and which has been crowned the Queen of the West. The domicil of the Langleys was a small frame building situated in the upper part of the city, having no pretensions to taste or elegance. 
               Mr. Langley commenced life "among the lowly," a shoe-maker by trade; but, having a larger amount of brains than could be profitably invested in that business, he naturally became restless and ambitious, and finally abandoned it altogether, adopting the legal profession as much better suited to his genius and money-loving propensities. He was a stout built, muscular man, nearly approaching the meridian of life. His sharp grey eyes peered restlessly out from beneath his dark shaggy brows, which almost screened them from view. His features were strongly marked, expressing an energy and determination capable of overcoming the most adverse circumstances, but one could not contemplate them without feeling a repulsive shudder creep through his frame. Already he had made considerable progress in ascending the hill to fortune; but acquisition only stimulated the desire for more, and increased his ambition to out-strip all competition in the accumulation of wealth. He could clearly discern the bright golden ball, tempting and irresistible, in its dazzling splendor, and he was determined to grasp it at all hazards. 
               Louisa Williams was left an orphan, in a strange hand-without kindred or friends, if we except Mrs. Dennis, the kind-hearted old lady, who had taken care of her through a long and severe acclimating fever. A few months previous to her introduction to the reader; death had deprived her of her parents, and left her to the mercy of a cold and heartless world, to fight the battle of life single-handed and alone. She was then scarcely more than six years of age-rather small, yet possessing, by nature, a good constitution. Ere sickness had prostrated her, she was sprightly and intelligent, though not impulsive. She was generous and sympathising in her disposition, and had rather strongly marked features for one of her age. She had been left sole heir to a small patrimony, which was rapidly increasing in value. This drew the arguseye of the law upon her, and, in her helpless condition, she was left to its mercy. So the law very gravely and wisely disposed of her to its entire satisfaction, just as it has done with hundreds of others. Laws may be always lawful, but they are, frequently, both unwise and unjust, as many a widow and orphan can testify. Mrs. Dennis could not refrain from tears as she imprinted a motherly kiss upon the marble cheek of the poor child, and saw her led forth into the world by one whom she had good reason to believe was cold-hearted, grasping and selfish. But she had no power to reverse the decree, and she could only pray God to be a father to the fatherless, and to temper his winds to the shorn lamb. 
               Time flew on, and with his potent wand brought health and laughter which blessed her infantile days, were supplanted by a silent and subdued expression. There was no kind, winning smile to penetrate the sad feeling of loneliness which surrounded her-no gentle voice whispered words of cheer to sooth the deep yearnings of her heart, or to instill into her young susceptible nature lessons of love, patience and virtue. All round her were stern, cold and forbidding; even nature, to her, wore a sad, dreary aspect, which harmonized with her own gloomy thoughts. What a life, what a lesson for a child! The only rays of sunshine which ever penetrated to the poor orphan's heart, were radiated from the benevolent, smiling visage of old Mrs. Dennis, who frequently called to see how she was getting on, and to encourage her with a kind word, although her visits were rather coolly received by the other members of the family. 
               "I do wish that old Mrs. Dennis would stay away, and not keep coming here to make that child more hateful that she naturally is. A fit of the sulks, or a fit of bawling is sure to follow her visits," said Mrs. Langley as she entered the sitting-room where her husband was deeply ruminating in a thick fog of tobacco-smoke. 
               "Why, what's the matter now? been having a pretty stiff breeze, I should judge from the racket I heard in the kitchen just now;" and Mr. Langley knocked the ashes from his pipe, preparatory to hearing his wife relate the story of her wrongs and vexations. 
               "O, Mrs. Dennis has been here again, hindering Louisa from her work, as usual. I had as good a mind to tell her to go about her business, as I ever had to do any thing." 
               "Why did you spoil it then?" 
                
               "Because Madam Dubois was in just at the time. She had called to see you about that lot, and she had only left a moment before you entered. I do wonder what that old woman has been putting into the child's head, for when I went into the kitchen, just now, she was crying like a great booby." 
               "She has, doubtless, been telling her now she is going away into a foreign country; that she never expects to see her darling pet again; that she must be a good girl and say her prayers; never say naughty words or think naughty thoughts; that her old granny will remember her and pray for her; and-and-but I have forgotten the rest of the old woman's sarmon. But, seriously, wife, I am glad she is going to leave, for she might put more into that girl's noddle than I should care for her to know," said Mr. Langley, with staring eyes, and compressed lips. 
               "She has been talking so long about going back to Philadelphia, that I pay no regard to what she says about it," replied the wife. 
               "But you may regard the thing now as certain." 
               "Certain?" 
               "Yes, a fixed fact, providing she lives to reach that place." 
               "What makes you so positive." 
               "What? why, I have willed it, and it must surely come to pass, that's all;" replied Mr. Langley, his countenance wearing one of those peculiar expressions which his wife well understood to mean more than he was ready to explain. 
               "Did Madam Dubois leave any message?" he inquired, after a few moments of silent reflection. 
                
               "Yes, that she would call again, to-morrow." 
               "Very well, I shall be able to give her a definite answer by that time. And there is one thing which I wish you to be careful to remember: if Mrs. Dennis comes here any more, be sure not to let her be alone with Louisa; there are some things which I wish that child not to know." And Mr. Langley departed for his place of business, leaving his wife in a rather foggy state of mind. 
               But, as her husband willed, so it happened, and a few weeks thereafter Mrs. Dennis was on her way to the home of her youth, from which she had long been absent. 
               Her departure, though a happy event for the Langleys, was a sad one to the poor orphan. She felt this bereavement more keenly than even the death of her parents, for she was then too young to realize her loss, or to comprehend her lonely and isolated condition. Mrs. Dennis had been her only earthly friend during the years of bondage through which she had passed; and, though she was seldom permitted to see her alone, yet a few words of gentle sympathy had occasionally fallen upon the orphan's heart, and all the more precious were they for being few. It is not surprising, then, that the poor child was almost inconsolable on parting with this, her only kind friend; for dark and cheerless indeed was the way in which she must now tread alone. She might well envy the African, in his bondage, for her's seemed even a more dark and cruel fate. Mrs. Langley had never permitted her to associate with other children; she had no moments of relaxation from the hard tasks imposed upon her; and iron hand wielded over her the rod of a most rigorous discipline, and her heart must have lost every incentive to battle with her hard and almost hopeless fate, had it not been for the natural buoyancy and firmness of her character. 
               But time moved onward, swiftly to some, but to the poor orphan bound girl, his steps seemed slow and laggard. Oh, how interminable were the days, weeks and months, as she counted and re-counted them-stretching their long line far out, before her eager, yearning gaze. Often did she wish that she could lie down in forgetfulness till all those slow, weary years had passed, which were to hold her in bondage-that she might then awake to the new life of joy and gladness, which her prophetic eye could faintly discern in the far distant future. 
               Two more years have left their weight of sorrow upon the poor orphan's heart; but now a ray of light shines in upon its darkened chambers-a faint, flickering ray at first, but destined to become broader and brighter, increasing, as the oil of sympathy and affection, which feeds the altar-fires of the heart, gathers into a deeper and broader current, in its onward course. 
               But we anticipate. 
               Two dark, very dark, years have passed since Louisa bade adieu to her kind friend, Mrs. Dennis, and an interesting event added one more to the family circle, introducing to the poor bound girl a new friend, in the person of Mrs. White, whom Mrs. Langley had employed as a nurse. The protracted illness which followed Mrs. Langley's confinement, gave time for the planting and germinating of that seed of friendship which was destined to spring up and bear rich and pleasant fruit. 
                
               Mrs. White possessed one of those warm, genial, sympathizing natures, which throws a flood of blessed sunlight upon all that comes within its influence; gentle, kind and loving, especially to the sad and unfortunate, she seemed truly an angel of mercy, sent to bind up the broken-hearted and comfort the sorrowing ones who are fated to tread the wine-press of affliction. What a thrill of undefined joy leaped through the orphan child's heart as she felt herself suddenly raised from the depths of darkness into this bright, dazzling light of sympathy and affection. Her heart, chilled and frozen by the cold winds of adversity, which had beaten so long upon it, felt its icy fetters loosened under the genial influence, and its deep fountains began slowly to pour forth those bright streams of joy and affection which had lain stagnant since, in her helpless orphanage, she was doomed to go forth to battle in the conflicts of life. 
               We will not now pause to point the reader to all the rocks, shoals and quicksands against which Louisa's frail barque was driven, on the tempest-tossed ocean of human existence, as she drifted up to womanhood. But she was now blessed with one earthly friend, good and true, who never deserted her amid sunshine or storm, many of whose kind works and noble, generous deeds must remain unrecorded in this brief and superficial history of the orphan bound girl. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER III. 
               WE will now pass over five years in the history of those we have already introduced to the reader, and present them with new scenery, and a new act in life's drama. In those few brief years, there have been many, and great changes, which might well astonish on unacquainted with the phases of life, in a new and rapidly-growing country, where fortunes are often accumulated as if by magic, leaving the uninitiated beholder utterly unable to comprehend the workings of the machinery by which it has been accomplished. 
               The mansion to which we will now introduce the reader is one wearing rather an imposing and aristocratic appearance, and is situated upon a gently sloping hill-side, upon the eastern outskirts of the now rapidly-growing Queen City, looking defiance, as it were, at the few straggling cottages that ventured to raise their humble roof-trees in the vicinity. The eye has seldom rested upon a spot of such magnificent beauty. The green sloping lawn and nicely graveled walks, bordered with rows of the most luxuriant forest-trees, nodding their richly crowned heads, and sporting in playful dalliance with the gentle breeze, as it shook the sparkling dew-drops from their boughs down upon the nicely shaven sward beneath, where it reflected the morning sun from unnumbered starry-like eyes. Clusters of shrubbery and rare flowers dotted the lawn-flowers from every clime-pleasing in their variety and brilliancy of color, and rich in delicate perfume. Thickly dotting the green carpet, were also sweet, modest wild flowers, peeping up from their mossy beds with bright smiling faces to welcome old Sol's earliest embrace, nodding gaily to their proud and lofty sisters, who slightly bent their dignified heads in return. But the little flowers cared not for the cold greeting of their foreign-born sisters; unlike frail humanity, they wore neither envy nor malice on their sweet, blushing faces, but smiled and nodded away as though they were the only blossoms of earth; dancing as lightly to the music-breathing zephyrs, as if they had never been trampled upon by rude and careless feet. Art and nature had combined to make the landscape one of surpassing beauty and grandeur. At the foot of the lawn, moving on in majestic state, was the calm, clear Ohio, bearing on its proud bosom the thriving commerce of the great and growing West, winding its way between the high, craggy hills and smooth, glassy vales; alternately changing its scenery from the grand and sublime precipices to the tame but not less beautiful lowland, where the pioneer cottages had already domesticated many of those wild and lovely gardens of nature. 
               On the right of the lawn was a small stream, which came leaping on, hemmed in by two high bluffs, that closely guarded their chafing prisoner till they saw it leap into the bosom of the Ohio and disappear. 
               On the left towered a high hill, crowned with a variety of luxuriant forest-trees. Hundreds of feet have scaled its rugged sides to enjoy the magnificent prospect seen from its summit-hundreds of eyes have turned upon it their admiring and thankful gaze, after a day's imprisonment within the dreary walls of brick and mortar-many a thrill of pleasure has been felt as the eye drank in that glowing scenery, just as the sun had paused to kiss the green hill-top, and robe it in a golden mantle ere it departed to its nightly slumbers. What a blessed respite from the turmoil and cares of business, which none more keenly enjoy than those who have been pent up all day in the workshop or counting-room, wearied and worn with anxiety and toil, and stunned with the din and tumult on every hand, till the lagging energies cry out for rest and quiet 
               We have gazed with admiration on the delightful surroundings of that elegant and antique mansion, and now, it you please, we will take a peep through the key-hole; or, if you choose to be less sly in you curiosity, we will frankly walk into breakfast-parlor. Seated at the breakfast-table, behold that lady and gentleman-such at least in all their out-ward adornments. 
               The lady is tall and commanding; her features are regular, but somewhat stern, and might make considerable pretension to beauty were they less masculine. The expression of her countenance shows firmness and a sort of rude hauteur, often in the uncultivated aristocracy, who take their position in society from their abundance of wealth, and manner of display. We should judge her age to be about thirty-five, although there are some juvenile appendages to her head-gear that might make us waver a little in our judgment. 
               The gentleman may be readily identified as the one already introduced to the reader as Mr. Langley. But now his hair is slightly frosted and his brow more deeply furrowed with lines of intense thought and perplexing cares. His mind seems wholly absorbed with the subject which now engages it, for the lady has spoken once or twice, but received no reply, and has now finished her last half-cup of coffee and is looking over the news which he has forgotten. Abruptly raising his head from his hand, where it has been uneasily propped for the last fifteen minutes, his eyes seek those of his companion, which have glanced at the paper and at the gentleman alternately, with a vexed, wondering expression for some moments past, and he inquires- 
               "Rebecca, who is that young man that seems to be paying such close attention to Louisa of late?" 
               "How should I know? I have never troubled myself about him," said the wife-for such was the relationship she bore to her companion. There is pique and curiosity mingled in her words and manner; perhaps she is slightly offended at the stubborn silence, so long and resolutely maintained by her husband, and wishes to awaken him to a sense of his ungraciousness. 
               Mr. Langley-for such we shall name him-seems not to notice the tart reply of his wife; his mind is too deeply interested with something of more importance, for after another brief silence, in which his thoughts are active, he remarks- 
               "He must be a stranger in the city, for I never saw him till quite recently; and, to speak plainly, I do not like his looks;" and Mr. Langley's scowling brows and clenched teeth bore witness to the truth of his last remark. 
               "Well, really, I have not thought enough about him to observe him very closely," said Mrs. Langley, her voice and manner somewhat modified by the earnestness of her husband. 
                
               "I have, and I repeat it again, I don't like the looks of the fellow, and shall have an eye to his proceedings." 
               "I do not see what there is about him that should have excited your attention so much; for my part I have scarcely noticed him at all, as he is very careful to make short calls, and them mostly at the kitchen-door. What do you think he is hanging about here so much for." 
               "Why, for that girl; what else could he be after?" 
               "He needn't be after her, for one year at least; and I shall let her know she is not to have beaus about my house," and Mrs. Langley looked indignation all over 
               "She has got a beau already," replied Mr. Langley, while a wretched attempt at a sardonic smile glared upon his face. 
               "What makes you think so?" inquired Mrs. Langely, Evidently taking a deeper interest in the subject. 
               Well, I can tell you, It seems that you have given Louisa liberty to go out pretty often of late; and twice I have seen her on the street conversing quite familiarly with that fellow, and I have observed them close, the gentleman in particular, and have come to the conclusion that he will bear watching at least. 
               "Is there any thing so very peculiar about him?" 
               "There is, and if he is not a gentleman in rags, why, there never was one, that's my belief; but what troubles me is, the rags are assumed." 
               "What on earth can be his intention? I am sure I can not see!" 
               "I can." 
                
               "Do you think he intends to deceive Louisa?" 
               "In some respects, yes! in some, no!" 
               "Well, really, I do not understand you;" and Mrs. Langley did look a little puzzled; not that she had less penetration than her husband, but she had never had more than a glimpse of the young man, and that only on two or three occasions. Still she saw nothing like an intimacy between him and Louisa, and as long as he took care not to hinder her from her work, she paid little attention to him. She had no idea that they had ever met out of her kitchen or she would not have given her liberty to go out, as she had done several times on Sunday evenings, when there was nothing to do, "But," continued the lady, after a moment's consideration, "I'll see to it, that she does not go out again soon, the hussy!" 
               "It will be well to keep an eye on her at home likewise, suggested Mr. Langley. 
               "I shall do that most certainly; but do enlighten me as to your conjecture concerning the young fellow's, or rather gentleman's motive. If he is a gentleman what can he want with a poor, ignorant, bound-girl, but to fool her? 
               "Louisa is handsome, that you must confess; but there may possibly be a stronger attraction than her beauty. I do not know why it is, but I have been strongly impressed of late that something was going wrong, and this fellow may get in my way more than would be agreeable," said Mr. Langley, compressing his lips and casting a meaning look at his wife which expressed far more than his words. 
               Mrs. Langley began to see, we suppose, for she opened wide her eyes as she read the expression of her husband's features. 
                
               "It can not be possible," she exclaimed, bending forward and clenching the tea-tray before her as a drowning person clutches a straw. 
               "There is scarcely any thing impossible in these days," observed the husband, cooling down as his wife warmed up, "but mind ye, and pay a little closer attention to that girl and the young gentleman, too. Examine Louisa as soon as possible, and find out who the fellow is, where from and what business brings him here. There is one thing that must be done, that's certain"-and the last sentence was more deeply impressed upon the understanding of the lady by the determined and emphatic gestures of Mr. Langley's head. 
               "What have you concluded to do?" eagerly inquired his wife, as she bent still further forward, her keen eyes fixed like a spell on her husband's face as though she would read his answer ere he had time to give it utterance. 
               "If Louisa marries, she must have a husband of my own choosing, and perhaps the quicker she has such a one the better." And Mr. Langley rose nervously from the table and left the house; but not till he had again requested Mrs Langley to lose no time in the investigation of the matter; cautioning her to be very careful in her proceedings; the last injunction, however, was entirely superfluous, as Mrs. Langley was not less shrewd and cunning than her husband; and, to use a vulgar phrase, could see quite as far into a mill-stone. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IV. 
               AFTER Mr. Langley had gone, Mrs. Langley sat silent for some moments, turning the matter over in her mind, considering in what manner it would be best to broach the subject to Louisa; at length she arose hastily and rang the bell. Immediately the door opened, and a young girl, apparently about seventeen years of age, made her appearance. Her form was perfect in every outline; her face, at first sight, might have been classed with the good-looking, but on closer examination it would have been called pretty, and by some even beautiful, for it was the expression that made it more lovely. Her large dark eyes mirrored a soul gentle, yet resolute. Her hair was put plainly back and twisted in a knot, which was firmly spiked to the back of her head with a faded horn-comb. This was not an arrangement altogether to Louisa's taste, but it was worn so at the command of her mistress. Her coarse frock of bark colored domestic, fit her but poorly; in fact there was no pretense to a fit; the only art displayed in the cutting, was to get it into some shape with the least possible labor. The tight sleeves reached only to the elbow-another piece of economy-and her arms, otherwise faultless, were browned from exposure to the sun and weather; her bare feet and ankles were small and well formed, although they had seldom felt the restraint of shoe or stocking-only when she was permitted to go out, and then some of Mrs. Langley's cast-away ones had to answer her purpose. Her step was light and easy when not in the presence of her mistress tress. Her voice was naturally soft and clear, but hesitating and confused when speaking to Mrs. Langley or her husband; her handsome features were sometimes marred by the sullen and dissatisfied expression they wore much of the time; but at the moment of her entering the room where she had been summoned as usual to clear away the breakfast things, her face wore its natural expression of sweetness. She was probably thinking of her last interview with the young man who had given Mr. Langley so much uneasiness. It had been one of particular interest, and awakened thoughts and feelings in her bosom, before unknown, and now only partially under-stood. In an instant the sweet expression passed from her features, and one half sad, half defiant, overshadowed them as her eye met the vapory visage of her stately mistress. 
               "Louisa," said Mrs. Langley, as the former commenced removing the breakfast dishes, "Who is that young man that calls on you so often?" Louisa east a timid, troubled glance at her mistress, as if to read her motive for asking the question; but she saw so much determination expressed in the stern gaze riveted upon her, she felt that nothing short of an unequivocal answer would suffice. Summoning her courage she firmly replied, "his name is Henry Wilson." 
               "Where is he from? and how came you to get acquainted with him?" 
               "I believe he was formerly from Philadelphia; I was introduced to him at Mrs. White's, where he boards." 
               "What business does he follow?" 
               "Indeed I can not tell, for I never heard any one say." 
               "How long has he been in the city?" 
               "Only a few weeks I believe." 
                
               "Then it would seem his business is hunting a wife," said Mrs. Langley, as she fixed her penetrating eye full on Louisa; who, notwithstanding her assumed firmness, quailed beneath the annihilating gaze as though she had encountered an evil spirit. Hastily gathering up a salver of dishes, she was about leaving the room to avoid further questioning, when Mrs. Langley very emphatically ordered her to stop. 
               "I presume," said she, "he had told you this muen of his business, at least." 
               "He has not," Faltered Louisa, in a sullen tone. 
               "Strange that he has not told you, in one of these street excursions you have been indulging in lately," said Mrs. Langley, in a sareastic tone; "I don't see what those private interviews are for, if not for love-making." 
               A slight blush tinged Louisa's cheek at the last remark of her mistress, which almost instantly receded and left her face pale as death. Her eyes that had been stealing occasional glances at Mrs. Langley's fear-inspiring face, suddenly sought the carpet; her heart throbbed with a stifling sensation, and her slender frame trembled with mingled emotions of surprise and fear. How came Mrs. Langley to know that she had been out walking with Henry Wilson? somebody had been making themselves busy. But what if she had met him secretly, she was sure there was no harm in that! he had been kind and polite, and had seemed to take a warm interest in her welfare. To be sure, she had never asked Mrs. Langley's consent to walk with him, for she knew she would oppose it, out of sheer contrariness, if nothing else, for such was the disposition she had always manifested toward her. She had never spoken kindly to her, nor manifested the least interest in her welfare; she had only been oppressive and cruel-a severe task-mistress, making her perform all the drudgery of the household. She had been taught neither to read nor write; there had never since her remembrance been a ray of sunshine on her pathway till the few bright gleams that had been thrown across it, in her becoming acquainted with Henry Wilson. Both Mr. and Mrs. Langley had ever shown a sort of persecuting hatred toward her; she had often thought that they wished her out of their way; but why it was so, was more than she could guess, having always striven to please them, even though she had never seemed to do so. It is not surprising than that she kept her own counsel, as she could hope for nothing from her guardians. 
               "You are caught at last, miss," Continued Mrs. Langley, after a few moment's of fiendish enjoyment of Louisa's perturbation; "and when you get liberty to go out again, you'll know it, I guess." 
               Louisa, again attempted to make her escape from the room, but ere she had reached the door she was brought to a stand-still, by the words, "Stop miss, I have notg ot through the catechism yet;;" but just at this moment the door-bell rang, and the entrance of a visitor put an end to further questioning. 
               It may well be imagined that Louisa did not spend a very comfortable day after her morning's adventure, though there was nothing more said to her on the subject. Perhaps Mrs. Langely had concluded to confer with her husband before, proceeding further? She felt a presentiment that the worst had not yet come, and was satisfied that there was a hidden meaning in what she had seen, something beyond her ability to fathom. She had noticed, in their morning interview, something different in the expression of Mrs. Langley's face from any thing she had ever seen there before. Why should she care if she did meet Henry Wilson and walk with him; there was nothing so very criminal in it; others did the same thing, and it was thought quite proper, so far as she had any knowledge on the subject; and she was quite sure Mrs. White would not encourage her to do wrong, for she was a good, kind-hearted woman, and had always shown an interest, in her welfare. She had been her only sympathizing friend till her recent acquiantance with Henry; and it was through her that their meeting and further acquaintance had been brought about. True, it had been done by the Henry's request, but Mrs. White was so well pleased with the young man's behavior, that she encouraged their intimacy. We will not say that Louisa was in love, but a friendly and sympathizing chord had been touched in her bosom, that must sooner or later bring about that state of affairs, if nothing happened to mar the harmony of her feelings. 
               Henry had been the first young man that had sought her acquaintance, and it must be confessed that she had been a little puzzled, as well as her friend, Mrs. White, at the preference shown by one so much superior in education and refinement, if not in dress. But Louisa was handsome, and had a natural grace and dignity in her manner, that Mrs. Langley had not been able to eradicate, although she had striven hard to do so. 
               Mr. Langley had been called away from the city on business, and did not therefore return home till tea. After finishing his repast, he again recurred to their morning's subject by asking is wife if she had found out any thing about Louisa's beau. 
                
               "Very little," said Mrs. L., and then went on and repeated in substance their morning's colloquy. 
               "A stranger, and from Philadelphia; I suspected as much!" reiterated Mr. Langley, after hearing his wife through; "this may prove a serious matter yet," continued he, leaning back in his chair, staring at the wall, his teeth so firmly clenched that his under lip protruded considerably beyond the upper, while a dark frown contracted his brow, rendering him any thing but a pleasant object for contemplation. 
               "You may be all wrong in your conjectures," suggested Mrs. Langley, after scanning her husband's troubled face for some moments. 
               "I may be, that's true, but I have good reason to doubt it." 
               'What are your reasons?" 
               "Well, I will tell you; a day or two ago, I happened to call at Lawyer Allen's office, and there was this Henry Wilson, as you call him, in earnest conversation with the lawyer. They were a little startled on seeing me enter, but soon recovered themselves. I am satisfied from their manner that their conversation referred to myself. You know that Allen has a grudge at me ever since I made him pay five hundred dollars for not fulfilling the contract of payment on that lot I sold him. He is a shrewd fellow and will make a dangerous enemy if he should get a clue to some things that are past; and if I mistake not, this Wilson is of the same stripe. I scanned him closely as he was leaving Allen's office, though he tried to conceal it. There is something in his look and manner which convinces me that he is not what his coarse garb would indicate. 
                
               "Can it be possible that old Mrs. Dennis has become sane and still lives? I thought she must have died years ago," inquiringly remarked Mrs. Langley, as her husband concluded; "I wish, now, that we had made matters a little safer in that quarter." 
               "I wish so, too," replied the husband, "but it can not be altered now." 
               "What course do you intend to pursue?" 
               "I shall be governed by circumstances of course; we must endeavor to find out more about this Henry Wilson; it may require some nice maneuvering, and we must proceed very cautiously, lest we fall into our own pit. I think it will be better to change our manner of treatment to Louisa; a little flattery and encouragement would serve to throw her off her guard, and give me a better chance to make Wilson's acquaintance, which I must do as speedily as possible." 
               "Your idea is a good one, and I shall not fail to act upon it," said Mrs. Langley, as she arose and summonsed Louisa to remove the tea-things. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER V. 
               "HERE is a present for you Louisa!" blandly spoke Mrs. Langley, as she handed the former a half-worn, but very tasty collar. Louisa stood speechless with amazement, staring at the donor with a comical, bewildered look. So paralyzed with wonder and surprise was she, that she did not extend her hand to receive the gift till the lady added smilingly, "Will you not accept it?" 
               Louisa took the proffered collar with a scarce audible "thank you," and after examining it very minutely, though she had seen it many times before, put it carefully aside and resumed her morning work; but her thoughts were busy with the strange phenomena she had just witnessed. She had seen some wonderful things in the brief period of her existence, but nothing like this. Mrs. Langley had never smiled so kindly upon her before, nor given her so nice a present. It is true she had fallen heir to much of that lady's cast-off-clothing, but it had only been the coarser sort, and then it had been handed over to her with a reluctant frown, instead of a smile; and to receive such kind treatment at the very time that she expected the full measure of her anger was about to be poured out upon her, increased her astonishment. In fact she had prepared herself to encounter a full-grown tornado, from what had transpired the day previous, but the reverse was like a dazzling glean of sunlight bursting forth from the tempest-threatening horizon, ere the storm-king had marshaled all his forces to the combat,. She was completely puzzled, and the more she tried to solve the mystery the more mystified she became; but hoping that a brighter day was about to dawn upon her dark destiny, she went on with her labors more cheerfully than was her wont. Yes, thou lone and neglected toiler on life's rugged and thorny way! there is a brighter day dawning on thy sad and aching heart; but alas! that bright dawn must be heralded by darkness, deeper. denser, than that which has already fallen on thy lonely, persecuted orphanage. Thy young and bruised spirit must pass through the fiery furnace, and may the Lord bring thee forth pure and beautiful and give thee to drink of the sweet waters of affection. 
               When Mr. Langley came home to dinner he deposited a bundle on the sideboard, which proved to be a pair of new shoes for Louisa; finer ones than she had ever before worn, which, as may well be supposed, increased her astonishment; but when a new calico dress and Mrs. Langley's last year's hat was added to her suddenly accumulating wardrobe, she almost ceased to wonder at any thing. Kind words, too, began to sound quite familar and much useless labor was dispensed with. She was kindly requested to perform some duty, when before she had been harshly commanded to do it. 
               Sunday afternoon came, and notwithstanding Mrs. Langley's previous threat, Louisa was granted leave of absence even earlier than usual. She had promised to meet Henry Wilson that day at Mrs. White's, and thither now we must follow her. 
               "The Lord have mercy on us!" exclaimed her astonished friend, as Louisa entered, clad in her new habiliments. "Why I scarcely knew you; where on earth did you get all them new things? And Mrs. White's wonder-speaking eyes wandered from bonnet to dress, and from dress to shoes, and from shoes back to the bonnet again, as she stood with one hand, feeling about the ample border of her muslin-cap in search of the truant 'specs that she might examine more closely the pretty collar that now drew her attention. "Well really, you do look quite lady-like," she continued, as she removed Louisa's fine bonnet, and took another survey of her new rigging. "I wonder what is going to happen?" and Mrs. White sat down by her friend, breathlessly awaiting an explanation. 
               "Why do you not wonder what has happened?" remarked Louisa, looking half sad, half pleased into her kind friend's perplexed face. 
               "Well, well, them Langley's must be getting ashamed of their meanness. I think it's quite time for folks are beginning to talk." 
               "About what?" said a manly voice, as Henry Wilson entered, just in time to hear the closing remark of Mrs. White. 
               "O, it's you, is it?" said the old lady, rising to set a chair for the new-comer. "Shall I introduce you to Miss. Williams?" gaily added she, as Henry stood regarding the transformed girl in mute surprise. "Didn't I tell you that she would be as handsome and lady-like as need be, if she could only have nice clothes?" And Mrs. White regarded the twain with a look of pride and satisfaction, as she saw Henry's admiring gaze riveted upon Louisa's blushing face. 
               Henry Wilson was a true type of nature's noblemen. His broad expansive brow, bore evidence of a high order of intellect lect and generosity, but a mass of much neglected, dark brown hair, now nearly concealed it from view; an aquiline nose and large hazel eyes, combined energy and gentleness; his mouth was rather large, but finely formed and well calculated to utter the free and noble sentiments of the heart. His dress was coarse and carelessly worn, and showed unmistakable marks of repairs. We must admit there was a sort of incongruity in his look and manner, taken all together, that would puzzle the close observer; but the less scrutinizing, saw not those marks of cultivation and true greatness which his furless slouched hat so well concealed. Mr. Langley's eye was too keen and penetrating, he had studied human nature too closely to be easily deceived; and what more particularly aroused him was Henry Wilson's appearance when he met him at Allen's office; his tangled locks were put back from his forehead till the whole massive structure of intellect met his astonished gaze. But there was something still more suspicious, in the fact of his being acquainted with Allen and Louisa; the two persons of all others he had the most reason to fear and dread. After all, his suspicious might have been awakened more by a guilty conscience than any thing he really saw. His greatest anxiety now was to meet and converse with the stranger, and then he could determine what course it was best to pursue. It was to accomplish this that Louisa was metamorphosed and sent out as a decoy, thinking that Henry might be thrown off his guard and visit her at home, and thus give Mr. L. a better chance to study him and watch his movements. 
               Under different auspices, it is not likely that Louisa would have gone to Mrs. White's to meet Henry: neither would he have requested it; but under existing circumstances it was the best arrangement they could hit upon. He had made a few brief calls on Louisa, it is true, but they had been more designed for "taking notes" than for any other purpose. 
               After some common-place conversation, in which the three friends joined, Henry asked Louisa if she would like to take a walk; on receiving an answer in the affirmative, he donned his slouched hat, while Mrs. White went to fetch the secondhand twenty dollar bonnet, which had carefully been put away from the flies, and, placing it on the head of the smiling orphan girl, she could not help exclaiming, "how pretty she looks!" Louisa did look pretty, if not really beautiful; there was now no tempest to ruffle her naturally mild and sweet disposition; all were smiling around her, and an answering smile wreathed itself with the rose and lily that bloomed on her fair face. Her hair was nt as it used to be, for under the new dispensation, she had ventured to arrange it after her own taste, and more in keeping with the fashion of the times. Louisa would have been truly happy had it not been for a vague and undefinable apprehension of something dark and fearful gathering about her like the black, molten-edged clouds that foretell the coming hurricane. Her heart was sad in spite of all her efforts to dispel its gloom with hope's kindling beams of happier days to come. Few words were spoken by either, as they walked on toward the open country, meeting hundreds of pedestrians on their Sunday excursion. They knew not that an evil eye was upon them, watching their every step; but so it was. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VI. 
               JUST beyond the northern limits of the city, there was at the time of which I write, a grove of forest-trees, crowning an eminence which towered high above the basin of bottom-land, in which the first settlers laid the foundation of that fair city which has become the acknowledged Queen of the West, and which has now spread out over hill and valley, converting all of those once green hill-sides into streets, where busy trade and commerce keep up their never-ceasing din and tumult. It was to this grove that Henry Wilson and his companion bent their steps. It was a favorite resort to those who loved nature in its original grandeur, and the pure, fresh air, free from dust and smoke. Groups of loiterers were to be seen in every direction, going and coming, and others reclining in the cool shade of some giant oak that stood sentinel on the edge of the forest. 
               "Here is a nice seat where we can have a delightful view of the city and the river beyond," said Henry, as he led Louisa to the trunk of a fallen tree just within the edge of the wood. "The hill seems alive with people to-day, and it's no wonder, with such a beautiful prospect all around; but it is only the young and healthy who are able to climb this steep hill-side; and they seem to enjoy it with a keen relish," he continued, as the merry hum of juvenile voices greeted them on every hand. 
               "You must be very much fatigued, for it is a long hill and rather a hard one to climb," remarked Henry, as he looked upon her flushed face and moist brow. 
               "Oh, no, I ma used to exercise." 
               "But not exactly of this sort, I think." 
               "No, I have not been used to long walks since Mr. Langley got Dick to run of errands." 
               "That makes it easier for you, I suppose." 
               "Not much, for I have to do the more work, and besides it was a relief to get out of sight and hearing of home sometimes, for Mrs. Langley was forever scolding." 
               "But there has been quite a change of late, it seems?" 
               "Yes." 
               "Do you know what has happened to make them so liberal, and even extravagant, in your wardrobe?" and Henry's eye rested upon the gay bonnet, with a sarcastic smile mingled with contempt. 
               "I can not guess," replied Louisa, "but I am sure there is some mystery about it, from what I have been and heard." 
               "Do you hear much of their conversation?" 
               "Not much." 
               "Do they ever say any thing about me?" 
               "Mrs. Langley has," said Louisa, dropping her voice almost to a whisper, while her eye sought the ground where Henry was tossing up the dry leaves with a rude walking-stick which he held in his hand. 
               "What did she say?" 
               Louisa hesitated. She knew not what to do; should she tell him all that had transpired within the last eventful week, or evade the question. She had little confidence in her own judgment in such matters; but Henry read her perplexed look and decided the question in her mind by assuring her that she need have no fears in telling him; that it were better for both that he should know every thing that had been said. 
               Louisa then went on and related all that had transpired at Mr. Langley's since she last saw him, not omitting the severe catechising that Mrs. Langley had selected her to, and the displeasure she had manifested on the occasion. Could she have read all the changes of expression that passed over Henry Wilson's face, while listening to the narrative, she would have been more puzzled than ever; but her intuitiveness had been but little cultivated. She had learned to read her mistress's physiognomy, till within the last few days; but that was an easy lesson, for it always told nearly one thing, and told it plain. But she felt a strange fluttering at her heart, and a choking sensation in her throat several times while reciting her adventures, as Henry would put back the dark locks from his noble brow, and fix his full hazel eye, beaming with the thoughts that struggled in his breast, tenderly upon her; and she knew not why it was so. 
               "And you are certain that you heard Mr. Langley use my name while in conversation with his wife?" 
               "Yes." 
               "Did you hear any other name mentioned?" 
               "I thought I heard the name of Dennis" 
               Henry started, but for some moments remained silent and thoughtful. He had been fearful that their suspicions had been aroused ever since he encountered Mr. Langley at Allen's office; for he marked the scrutinizing gaze that followed him on that occasion as he withdrew. "I wish I could tell her all," thought he, as he met Louisa's inquiring and perplexed look; but he did not believe it prudent to do so now; she might be led to betray the secret, for he well knew that her guardians would keep a constant watch over her, and note every word and act; for suspicion is doubly vigilant when self-interest is involved, and a full knowledge of his plans, at this time, might give him much trouble, if not entirely upset his present prospects. Wealth is frequently more powerful and effective than law, however just the latter. 
               A slight rustling among the bushes near by drew their attention, but on looking around they saw nothing, an d concluded that it was some of the idle loiterers passing that way. As the sun was now fast nearing the western hill-tops, they arose and took up their homeward line of march. 
               "It may be necessary for me to see you again to-morrow evening;" said Henry, as they entered the thronged streets, where groups of noisy children blockaded the narrow side-walks, making it difficult for the returning tide of afternoon strollers to pick their way in safety to themselves and the heedless ones that stood with eyes fixed on the charmed circles, in the center of which was placed large white marbles; "but as you can not leave home without increasing the suspicion of your guardians, I will see you there. You can keep a look out from your window, and as soon as I am sure that the family have retired, I will approach and give you a signal, when you can join me in the summer-house on the left of the walk. It is so thickly covered with vines that I think we shall be quite safe from observation there, you have nothing to fear from me, be assured," he continued, after noticing Louisa's serious look and hesitating acquiesence to his proposal, but everything to hope and gain. 
               "But what if Mr. Langley should discover us?" 
               "Only be cautious and prudent, and there is no fear of that, but you must be on your guard-keep everything a profound secret from them; be not deceived with smiles nor soft words, for smiles and words are not always what they appear. You have old and cunning heads to deal with, and let me charge you again, to keep your own council." 
               Louisa promised to follow his injunctions to the letter, but her woman's curiosity was at a fever heat, although she questioned him not, for she saw so much earnestness and truth mirrored in his face that she entertained no doubts as to his sincerity and good intentions. They had now approached as near to Mr. Langley's as it was deemed prudent for Henry to go, and after a repeated caution, and an assurance that he would not disappoint her, they separated, he to seek his friend Allen, and Louisa to return home, with a thousand strange, wild phantoms in her agitated mind, which bewildered her brain, and brought on that well-known disease called absent-mind-ed-ness. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
               "WELL, I have got at the secret at last, said Mr. Langley to his wife, as he sat his hat upon the center-table, and ran his fingers nervously through his bristly hair, giving it a ferocious look, as it stood straight out in all directions, rigid and stern as he who wore it. "It is just as I expected; this Wilson is here under false colors, and thinks to make a fine haul; but he may find himself mistaken for once in his life." 
               "Did you see them?" 
               "Yes, and heard them, too." 
               "Where?" 
               "Out on the hill." 
               "Did they not see you?" 
               "No, but they came very near it, as I was creeping to a clump of bnshes close by where they were sitting." 
               "Did you hear all they said?" 
               "No, not all, but I have heard enough to confirm my suspicions, and decide me in the course to be pursued with that girl." 
               "And what is that?" eagerly inquired the wife, in a low tone, as she drew closer to her husband, that their voices might not reach other ears, perhaps not less interested. 
               "Louisa must not see that fellow again; you are not to let her leave home on any consideration; and even here we must keep a strict watch over her until she is married." 
                
               "Married!" ejaculated Mrs. Langley; and, after another move, she sat bolt upright, with her wonder-speaking eye riveted upon her husband's mystifying face, where a malicious grin half closed the nether eye, and wrought strange contortions generally. 
               "Yes, married!" 
               "To whom?" 
               "To whoever I choose; I think David Grant will make her a very good husband; at least he will answer my purpose," said Mr. Langley, looking both wise and wicked in his exultation of having hit upon such an excellent plan to accomplish his purpose. 
               Hard-hearted and selfish as Mrs. Langley was, she was evidently horrified with the idea of Louisa being forced into a union with David Grant. 
               "Believe me, she will never consent," said Mrs. Langley, after a few moments' consideration of the subject. 
               "But she shall." This was spoken so decidedly that Mrs. Langley remained silent. She knew that if her husband willed it, and the decree had gone forth, nothing short of the interposition of Providence could prevent it. 
               "To-morrow morning I shall inform her of my wish, and if that Wilson has not communicated his secret, which I think he has not, I may hold out such inducements as will make her accept the proposition without resorting to force; but she must not see him again or I may be compelled to resort to some more desperate means, which may not be quite so pleasant for either of us." 
               "I hope you will succeed," said the wife in a despairing tone. She knew too well that Louisa's feeling would revolt at the idea of marrying one scarce a grade above an idiot. But their only hope was in marrying her to one over whose actions they could hold entire control, and such an one she knew David Grant to be; therefore she thought it best to carry the plan into execution if possible; and doubtful as the case appeared, she determined to bring all her energies to the accomplishment of their plan. 
               "I know we shall have some sharp corners to turn, but when I undertake a job I never give up until it is finished, and that to my liking." And Mr. Langley shut his teeth firmly together and looked all the determination his words has expressed. "We will see, to-morrow," said Mrs. Langley, as she arose and led the way to their chamber, where, it is not likely that the sweet god, Morpheus, was in a hurry to visit them; for he has little sympathy for either the wretched or unhappy, and seems to delight in adding to their discomfort. 
                
               On the following morning as soon as Mr. and Mrs. Langley had finished their toast and coffee, which we must confess was partaken of rather sparingly, as they seem to have but little appetite for breakfast, a sudden jerk of the bell warned Louisa that her presence was required in the breakfast parlor; but she was a little startled on entering the room, to see that gentleman and lady still sitting at the table-a thing quite unusual. There was, also, something peculiar in their look and manner, which made her heart beat quicker and her step less firm than when she left the kitchen. 
                
               Well, Louisa, I have good news for you," said her guardian, not pretending to notice her trepidation, as she stood regarding the twain in silent wonder. "Do you wish to hear it?" he added graciously, as the girl seemed quite too bewildered to ask the question, and hardly conscious of what she did, dropped into the first seat that offered support to her tottering limbs. It was not so much what she saw and heard that caused her this agitation, as what she felt. Her mind had been seized with some fearful misgiving at the moment she appeared before that family tribunal; but she did not even suspect the nature of the case now to be tried. Mr. Langley had very prudently adopted the plan of persuasion first, and force afterward; accordingly he had assumed one of his blandest smiles to begin with. "Calm yourself, my child," said he, to the trembling victim before him, "and listen to what I have to tell you; but first I must enquire if Henry Wilson has made you a proposition of marriage? 
               "He has not," faintly articulated the orphan girl. 
               "Has he given you reason to believe that he intends to do so?" 
               "No." 
               "Believe me, child, he has no intention of doing so. I know from his very look that he is an unprincipled libertine, a villain and I feel it my duty as your guardian, to put a stop to his further imposition, by requesting you to have nothing more to say to him. And to guard you against similar deceptions I think it best that you should marry. I have a husband picked out for you who can not fail to make you happy. And for a wedding present I will give you that beautiful tiful little cottage on Ludlow street, and furnish it to your taste. It will be a perfect paradise." 
               "And I will order a set of silver for you, to be got up in the most elegant style," added Mrs. Langley. 
               "You shall have the handsomest dress that the city can produce to be married in, and whatever else you choose. What say you to the proposal?" and Mr. Langley fixed his penetrating gaze full upon Louisa's face, as if to read her every thought and emotion, as she sat speechless, striving in vain to collect her scattered senses; but they would not come together so as to give her any definite idea of what had been said to her. 
               "You are silent, Louisa? Perhaps the name of the person I have chosen to be your future husband will bring back your speech. It is David Grant, Esq.," said Mr. Langley, with a smile slightly tinctured with the satanic. "He has been deeply in love with you for a long time, and last week he asked my consent to address you, which I gave, of course, and like-wise promised my assistance by breaking the subject to you, and I am confident that your good sense will approve of what I have done; and likewise consent to my very modest request." 
               "You may think yourself very fortunate in getting so nice a husband, and thank us for giving you your freedom a year before you are of age," Mrs. Langley added, while she tried to assume a very benevolent and disinterested expression; but her fear-excited nerves drove off, and left her staring at Louisa with the wildest impatience, while the poor girl looked from one to the other; but a thick vapor obscured all objects from her sight, and but for a table which gave her support, she would have fallen to the floor. 
               "Do you wish time to consider the matter?" said her guardian, seeing she still hesitated, "Why do you not speak?" he added impatiently, after a few moments' profound silence. 
               Louisa timidly raised her eyes to her guardian's face, where they seemed transfixed for some moments, but the piercing and slightly ferocious gaze she encountered, aroused her to the full sense of her situation, and wrought a reaction both mental and physical. In a moment, as it were, she had metamorphosed from a subdued, trembling, slave girl to an independent woman. Her courage and self-possession came back doubly strengthened, and fixing her fearless and determined gaze on her unprincipled guardian with such haughty indignation he was brought to quail before her, and was forced to change his position ere he could proceed. 
               "Have you determined yet?" he asked after pacing up and down the room for a few minutes. But his voice was changed now, and a slight tremor might have been detected in his modulated, yet slightly authoritative tone. 
               "In regard to what?" inquired Louisa, in so clear and firm a voice that Mr. and Mrs. Langley instinctively exchanged glances before the former could reply. 
               "In accepting the husband, the house, and the furniture." 
               "I have no objection to the house and furniture, but the husband I must beg leave to decline. 
               "But you must take all or none." 
               "Then I shall refuse all." This was uttered in such a positive tive and decided tone that it brought Mr. Langley to a sudden stand-still, facing his opponent. 
               "Not so fast girl," he hissed; "remember it is in my power to make you accept all; but I will give you twenty-four hours to consider the matter, but on your peril do not attempt to leave the house or communicate with any one without our leave, and let me warn you to beware of your decision." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               Louisa knew not what to do. Her cup of adversity seemed filled to overflowing; her mind was distracted with doubts and fears in regard to Henry Wilson-the heartless insinuation her guardian had thrown out, rang like a death knell of hope and happiness; and the thought of being forced into a connection with one who could only excite pity-one who she had scarcely deemed as belonging to the human species-aroused a degree of pride and energy in her bosom which had never before been fathomed, and which she knew not that she possessed. "Marry an idiot! No! she would suffer death before her feelings should thus be outraged. What could be Mr. Langley's motives for wishing he to marry David Grant. There was something provokingly mysterious about the matter. She did not suppose that David really knew what the word matrimony meant; and surely she had never spoken to him a dozen times in her life." The whole thing was so supremely ridiculous that she was forced to laugh in spite of her wretchedness. No wonder that she salted the tea instead of the steak, let the toast burn, and met with more accidents generally, on that day, than she had ever met with in a whole year before. "She could forget Henry Wilson, but never would she marry David Grant." 
               Such were her thoughts during that day, the longest she had ever lived; at least it seemed so to her, and such were the thoughts she carried at night to her rude chamber over the kitchen. She had promised Henry to meet him in the summer-house that night, and she had been forbidden to leave the house or to communicate with any one. What was she to do? Perhaps it was best that she should disappoint Henry, it was quite possible that she was deceived in him. There was something so mysterious in all that had lately happened, that she felt her own judgment inadequate for her guide in the dilemma. 
               She sat some time with her head resting upon the window-sill, yet unable to come to any definite conclusion in regard to meeting Henry, when her ear caught the sound of approaching footsteps, and aroused her from her waking dream. Her first thought was to close the window and thereby break off all further intercourse with her visitor-lover she was not authorized in calling him, but the next moment she thought of David Grant, and a feeling akin to despair, took possession of her bosom. She would see Henry once more, In defiance of her guardian. There was nothing as terrible to her as the thought of marrying David Grant. 
               "Yes, I will redeem my promise and meet him as he requested." She looked out and saw Henry waving a white handkerchief, and almost unconsciously she answered the signal. She arose and cautiously left her chamber, and stole down stairs to the back door, but what was her chagrin to find it looked and the key removed; she tried another door and found it as the first; she then crept to the front door, hoping to find egress by that; but alas, this too had been made impassable to her. This was a new difficulty, which she had not thought of, and for a few moments she felt like giving up in despair; but the form of the idiot rose up before her and stimulated her to renewed exertions. She crawled back to the Kitchen and examined the Window; that, too, was fast, and she was afraid, if she attempted to open it by force, she would arouse her guardian; but the thought that she might escape through the cellar flashed; upon her mind, and the next moment she was feeling her way cautiously to the stair-door. The cellar had an outer hatch-and the trap-door fastened on the inner side with a slide, or bolt. Groping her way slowly through the deep darkness, among barrels and boxes, she at length reached the hatch-way, and found, to her joy, that they had forgotten to make that fast; or else, they thought she would not attempt to leave the house by so difficult a route. After carefully pushing back the bolt, she emerged into the open air, and in a moment more, stood before Henry Wilson, who had almost given up seeing her. 
               "You have come at last," said he. "I began to think you were going to disappoint me." 
               "I thought at one time that I should be compelled to do so," replied Louisa, as they walked lightly toward the summer-house; "Mr. Langley had fastened all the doors and taken away the keys, and I had to come out through the cellar, which had been forgotten." 
               "Is Mrs. Langley in the habit of thus securing the doors?" 
               "No; I never knew them to take away the keys before." 
               "Has any thing new happened?" 
               Louisa hesitated. Should she tell him all-would he care to befriend her, and thus bring down the vengeance of her guardian upon himself. 
                
               "Have they forbidden you seeing me?" he inquired, as they sat down on a bench within their vine-covered retreat. Something suggested the thought at the moment; perhaps it was the appearance of Langley, whom he had accidentally come in contact with, only a few hours before. 
               "Do not be afraid to tell me all," he continued, noticing Louisa's embarrassment, "your secret will be safe with me, and as I told you, yesterday, it is better that I should know all." 
               "They have," said she, in a voice almost suffocated with emotion and fear. "Speak very low, or we may be heard; for they will be on the watch, and I don't know what they would do to me, if they find out that I have disobeyed them." 
               "Fear not, I will be your friend, if you will only trust me; but do you know why they have forbidden you to see me?" 
               "No; but there is something very singular in their actions." 
               "What is it?" Will you not trust me?" he continued. Seeing Louisa again hesitated. 
               Oh, I hardly know what to do. Mr. Langley would kill me, if he knew I told you"-and sob after sob prevented her from answering Henry's eager questionings, until she had given vent to her feelings in a flood of bitter tears. 
               "Tell me all, I implore you," said Henry, taking her trembling hand, which was icy cold, in his warm grasp. "I pledge you my word and honor as a gentleman-yes, as a gentleman, that your confidence shall not be abused, and that I will be your friend and protector in every emergency." 
               "You will not deceive me, then?" timidly inquired the orphan girl, as she became somewhat composed. 
                
               "No, surely not; what makes you suspect me?" 
               "Mr. Langley says you are only imposing upon me." 
               "Did he give you his reasons for saying so." 
               "No; only he didn't like your looks." 
               "Perhaps not, but do you think I look like an imposter?" 
               "I don't know. I have had but little experience," she replied, in a trembling, hesitating voice. 
               "Have I ever done or said any thing to make you doubt my word or honor?" 
               "Never." 
               "Then be assured I never shall. Listen, Louisa! I came here at the earnest and dying request of a friend and relative, to do every thing in my power to assist a poor orphan girl in securing her rights; and I trust I shall succeed in my undertaking; but to do so, I must have your entire confidence. There are a great many quibbles in law which you would not understand, but which have to be carefully considered and cautiously managed, and it is highly necessary to keep everything a profound secret from your guardian until your indentures expire, and then we can proceed more openly. Mr. Langley has, unfortunately for us, become suspicious of my business, but we must try and throw him off the track. But before I go further, I should like to know all he has said, if you think you can trust me." 
               "He says I must marry David Grant," faltered Louisa, half bewildered with what she had just heard. 
               "And who is this David Grant?" anxiously inquired her companion. 
                
               "O, he is a poor simpleton, who sometimes saws wood, and does chores for people who are acquainted with him." 
               "Can not you consent to do so?" 
               "Never! I will die first," replied Louisa, with so much energy and decision, that Henry was a little startled, for he had feared that her guardian had unlimited power and control over her-that she was simple-minded and broken-spirited-that she would submit to whatever they commanded; but he was glad to know that she had a woman's will, and something of her energy. 
               "Louisa, you must leave Mr. Langley's immediately," said he, after she had given him all the particulars of her interview with her guardian that morning. 
               "But it is nearly a year before I am free." 
               "He seems quite willing to give you up sooner, and besides, he has forfeited all claims on you, by his unlawful conduct." 
               "Where shall I go? I have not a relative in the world that I know of, and no friend able to protect me against the persecutions of that bad man." 
               "I have offered you that protection; will you not accept it?" 
               "But are you not risking too much for me?" 
               "There is no risk so great but I would willingly incur it to save you; but be assured there is no danger if you will trust implicit confidence in me and be guarded by my judgment." 
               The tone and manner in which this was said, affected Louisa deeply, and strengthened her confidence and trust in Henry's purity of motive, to a degree that she had never before felt; and with it came renewed energy, and a resolution to place herself under his protection, and trust in Providence for the result. "We have no time to lose," continued Henry, after giving his companion a few moments for reflection, "You must decide at once." 
               "Henry, I have full confidence in you, and shall be guided by your judgment; but where do you propose to take me?" 
               "To Philadelphia, where you will be safe from your guardian, and be kindly cared for; but it will be necessary for him to be entirely ignorant of your manner of escape, or where you have gone. You say he has given you till morning to make up your mind to marry David Grant; you can still hesitate in your decision, and ask another day, which he will be likely to grant, if your lead him to hope that you will give your consent. By to-morrow I can have every thing ready for your escape. I think it will be best that you remain concealed in the city a few days, that my presence here will lead them to believe that I have no knowledge of the matter. Go to your chamber as usual, but he prepared to leave it about midnight. If the doors are again secured, I can assist you to escape from your window. 
               "It shall be as you request; death itself would be preferable to a longer residence under that roof; but I had better return now for I tremble lest we may be discovered." 
               "Go, then; but be prepared to-morrow night. Let nothing daunt or swerve you from your purpose, and rest assured that I shall be watching over you," said Henry, pressing her hand warmly at parting. 
                
               Louisa was up the next morning earlier than usual. Sleep had not visited her eyes, nor given a moment's rest to her distracted mind. She looked weary and care-worn; but her thoughts were of so strange a mixture, that an attempt to unravel them would be useless; we shall therefore leave them to the reader's own imagination. She had not been long at her post when Mr. Langley made his appearance with the truant key. He was evidently chagrined at finding Louisa up before him, for he did not intend that she should discover her imprisonment, but he passed out without saying any thing; yet Louisa noticed a dark frown on his brow, and that he shut his teeth very closely together. She went about her work as unconcerned as though nothing had occurred out of the usual course of things. Her mind was so much occupied with the mystery in which she was shrouded from her own mental eye, and the contemplated escape from her oppressive and cruel guardians, that she had almost forgotten that the time was rapidly approaching in which her decision in regard to David Grant's suit must be given, till she was startled by the summons to appear before that dreadful tribunal, whose judge was a wicked, money-worshiping tyrant. She assumed as much carelessness and unconcern as possible in her present state of mind; but imagine her surprise and dismay, on entering the drawing-room, to behold sitting bolt upright, in the center of a splendid sofa, the living, breathing, grinning suitor for her heart and hand. Yes, there sat David Grant, large as life, rigged out in a bran new suit of blue broad-cloth, with gilt buttons, which mirrored every object in the room. His head was confined to the center of gravity by a well stiffened cravat, and his bell-crowned beaver and sharp-toed boots seemed to vie with each other in style and polish; the former he held in his hands regarding it with childish admiration, as Louisa entered and arrested his attention; when his mind seemed vaguely to comprehend the case on the docket; for the grin of admiration with which he had been regarding his new hat, deepened and widened to a fearful extent, till his large mouth, like Pharaoh's fat kine, seemed to have swallowed all its surroundings; he awkwardly arose and extended his hand to her, as she stood gazing in silent amazement on the scene before her. David Grant's appearance was a part of the drama which she had not anticipated, and was therefore, totally unprepared to meet; and as she stood before that dumpy form, with extending hand and annihilating grin, she was hardly conscious of the look of utter contempt with which she met his uncouth greeting. 
               Mr. Langley saw the contemptuous manner in which David's advances were met, and the demon was at work in his breast. But, something his resentment, he said in a calm bland tone-"Mr. Grant has called this morning to learn your decision to the proposal he made through me." 
               Here David's mouth widened another inch, and his awkward form wriggled about in a most painful manner, reminding one of a half-tamed bear, exhibited for the first time, with an empty stomach. And he remained quite as dumb, with his meaningless eyes rolling from one to another, as if he expected a move somewhere. 
               Louisa felt every drop of blood curdle in her veins; her indignation was wrought up to its highest pitch, but she stood speechless as the blue form rose before her. 
                
               "May we know your decision?" demanded her guardian, in a voice of impatience. 
               "Not to-day!" pleaded Louisa, with a voice darkened with fear and dismay. "Not to-day. I have not considered the matter sufficiently." 
               "Yes, to-day, and now!" firmly and savagely responded her guardian. 
               "Give me one day more," begged the despairing girl, as she recoiled before the fierce gaze that seemed to pierce her very soul with the sting of death. 
               "Not another hour!" and as he said this, he smote the table with such force that every one present started as if a young earthquake was about to swallow them; and David had actually reached the hall door in his precipitous flight, ere he discovered his mistake. 
               "Speak, girl," said her guardian, as he hastily arose and advanced to where Louisa stood, trembling and speechless. "Speak, and let us know your decision." 
               "Another day," she replied, "only one day more;" and the half-frantic girl shook so violently that she was only kept from falling by clinging to the door-post. 
               "Silence! did I not require your answer now?" and he seized her by the arm so violently that she uttered a piercing shriek, which made David clear the hall at one bound and take to his heels as if life and death depended on his speed. 
               "Will you marry David Grant, or will you not?" again demanded Mr. Langley, in a voice so awful, with meditated revenge, that it made even his wife shudder. 
               "I will not," replied Louisa in a firm tone, nerved by despair pair, while she returned her guardian's gaze with such a look of defiance that it almost staggered him in his resolution. 
               "Girl, do you know what may be the consequence of your rashness?" he roared, his face almost black with rage. "Think you that I am to be foiled thus by your stubbornness? No, by all the powers above I will accomplish my purpose, and you shall marry David Grant or die! Yes, die! and that, too, by all the misery of starvation. Do your still persist?" 
               "I do." 
               "Follow me, then," and with the grasp of a demon he dragged the half-senseless girl up two flights of stairs, and thrust her into a dimly-lighted attic, without sun or air, save from a small sky-light far above her reach. "Now girl, hear your doom," he fiercely exclaimed, as Louisa stood before him, with a look which made even him quail beneath her fixed and determined gaze. "You are to remain in this room, on a small allowance of bread and water, until you consent to wed David Grant." 
               "Be assured I shall never do that," replied Louisa, with her eyes still riveted on her guardian. 
               "Then you die! what say you to the sentence?" 
               "I say it is as inhuman as its inventor, and will profit you nothing." 
               "Silence! insolent hussy! or I will smite you to the floor at once," and he was only deterred from carrying his threat into execution by the fearless gaze Louisa bent upon him. Furiously slamming the door in her face, he bolted it strongly, and left the horror-stricken orphan to pour forth her sorrow in solitary confinement. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IX. 
               Mr. Langley had now taken a step which could not well be retraced, and saw little hope, save in the death of his victim. The affair had taken a turn quite different from what he expected, and plunged him into a difficulty for which he was entirely unprepared. He had not counted the cost, or considered the finale of such a proceeding; but he had time and food for reflection now, and soon regretted the step he had taken; not so much that his heart softened towards the poor girl; but whether she lived or died, he feared an exposure and its attendant consequences, which might prove rather serious; although for the present he felt quite safe, as he did not suppose that Louisa had seen Henry Wilson since their excursion the previous Sabbath, and that he could have no intimation of what had since transpired. If any one inquired for her, he could say she had gone into the country for a few weeks; in the meantime he could make up his mind as to the best course to be pursued. That she would consent to marry David Grant, he did not now hope; and if she did, it would not exactly answer his purpose, unless she could be removed to some distant part of the country, where, if she informed against him, it would not be likely to endanger his interest. If ever he needed the shrewd foresight and counsel of woman, it was in his present perplexity; and long and earnest was the parley held with his wife after returning to the drawing room, where we will leave them for a time to their wicked plottings and accusing consciences. 
               After the first emotion of horror and indignation had subsided, Louisa wept long and bitterly over her hard and cruel fate; but the assurance that she had one friend who would interest himself in her welfare was a great source of consolation in this trying hour of adversity. She thought, too, that her guardian would soon relent and undo her prison bars. Alas! she did not fully comprehend the secret spring to his motive, or she would not have cherished a hope of deliverance from that quarter. Gold! yes, an inordinate love of the sordid ore was his ruling passion, the god before which he bowed and offered up his virtue, honor and all that makes man good and noble. A passion, which left undisciplined, eradicates every just and honorable sentiment from the heart, and leaves man an object of hatred and disgust, who, in spite of untold wealth, leaves the earth which he has desecrated and cursed, without one to regret his departure, or shed a friendly tear over his grave. 
               The hour was fast arriving in which Louisa was to make her escape; but how was she to let Henry know of her imprisonment, or how could he rescue her without making the whole affair public? In vain she tried to hit on some plan to make known her situation. There was no window except a sky-light, and that was beyond her reach; and there was nothing in the room which would assist her to climb up to it. She tried her strength on the door, but she could not force it open, and she at length gave up in despair and lay down on the hard floor to rest and await the cheering light of day, in hope that morning would bring deliverance in some form. 
                
               Henry, true to his promise, had completed his preparations, and at the appointed hour was anxiously watching for Louisa to make her appearance. He kept his eyes constantly fixed upon her chamber window, but could detect no object there; no sign of any one moving about the house; everything was as hushed and still as the deep midnight which surrounded him. Hour after hour passed, and yet she came not, nor did he quit his post till the morning star looked out over the eastern hill-top, and warned him of the approach of day. A thousand conjectures presented themselves to his mind as the cause of his disappointment, but he knew not which, if any, was the true one; perhaps she had been detected the previous night, and confined more securely than before. She might have changed her mind and concluded not to leave her guardian till she was of age; but is so, it was very strange she did not apprise him of it; and he felt confident that she would if it were possible for her to do so; and he inclined to the belief that she was a prisoner in some way, and determined to use every effort to ascertain the truth, consequently he kept constant watch all that day to see if he could discover her about the premises. A thicket of underbrush on the side-hill effectually screened him from observation; but the long weary day passed and left the mystery still deeper than before, as it was evident that she was not employed as usual, for he could see every one about the kitchen-it was strange that Mrs. Langley should be performing the labor that the orphan girl had done for years. He could not account for it unless she had been sent away from home, which now seemed most likely. But he left not his hiding-place till darkness hid the mansion from view, and then it was only to approach nearer where he could see her window and take good note of all that passed. Midnight came, and brought no solution to the mysterious disappearance of Louisa. Sadly Henry left the spot where he had kept his fruitless watches and returned to Mrs. White's to snatch a few hours' rest, and to enlist that good woman into still further service. But he sought his pillow in vain; sleep, he could not, while the fate of the orphan girl was shrouded in such fearful mystery. No sooner did he hear a commotion among the pans and skillets below, than he was up and in the presence of his landlady, to whom he lost no time in communicating his suspicions in regard to Louisa's sudden disappearance, and earnestly besought her assistance in prying into the secret. It was finally decided that she should invent some excuse for calling at Mrs. Langley's and inquire for Louisa, which she prepared to do as soon as she had finished her morning's work. 
                
               "Fire! fire!! fire!!!" was shouted from street to street and from alley to alley as each one sent forth a stream of humanity to swell the great tide which was flowing into Sixth-street. Gingle, gingle, gingle, rattle, rattle, rattle, whoop whora, were the sounds which fully aroused Mrs. White from her thoughtful reverie, as the foremost engine swept past, drawn by a long team of men and boys who seemed determined to out-do all competition in the race, and be the first at the fire. On looking up she saw the street thronged with men, women and children, all gazing in the same direction; but an occasional shout from some excited urchin was the only audible sound coming from the multitude of anxious spectators. In dumb dismay, they stood gazing upon the burning building, as a dense cloud of black smoke was forced upward by the hot seething breath of the fire-king, whose red-forked tongue was seen issuing from the roof. The deathly silence is broken and a murmur runs through the crowd, as the form of a woman is seen rushing from the house bearing in her arms what seemed a heavy bundle rolled in a blanket. Few eyes are now looking on the fire, for nearly all are searching among the crowd for the woman with the bundle. There was a sensible swaying in one direction, and Mrs. White moving with the tide, soon found herself pressed into the ring which surrounded the object of their solicitude. A thrill of horror ran through her frame as she beheld the woman sitting upon the ground, her livid face, once beautiful, soiled and blackened with smoke, her garments nearly burnt from her body, gazing wildly upon the charred and horribly disfigured form of a small child which she held in her arms. No sound escaped her lips, no tears softened the burning brilliancy of her eyes, she seemed unconscious of the crowd around her, and heedless of the falling roof which had caused her so many days of toil and privations to rear. If, indeed, she was sensible at all, it was only of the loss of the idol of her heart, for which she had risked her own life, but had failed to save. We feel that it would be a desecration of the feelings of that mother to attempt to portray her agony of mind in the hour of her trial, for such torture must be felt before it can be even faintly understood. 
               "Another woman to be begging for more time to pay her debts; but thank God I have an agent now to attend to such matters," said a hoarse voice as its owner was pushing his way out from among the crowd which had gathered around Madam Dubois, for it is upon her that this sad and fearful misfortune has fallen, Mrs. White looked up and was shocked on beholding the hard features of Mr. Langley, whose lips had just uttered the unfeeling words which had grated upon her ear, and whose face was the only one present which betrayed no signs of sympathy for the unfortunate one. She saw him pause a moment to look upon the smoldering ruins of the poor bereaved widow, and then walk hurriedly away, with his eyes bent upon the ground and his lips firmly pressed together, as if his determination had become fixed and immovable. 
               "The villain is plotting to rob the poor woman of the little she has left," thought Mrs. White, as she slowly pursued her way toward the residence of Mr. Langley, her thoughts now divided between the widow and the orphan whose cruel destiny it was to be thus thrown upon the mercy of this hard-hearted mammon-worshipper. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER X. 
               "WELL, have you found out any thing concerning Louisa?" eagerly inquired Henry, as Mrs. White entered her own door, panting with the heat of a noon-day sun and her long walk. 
               "Nothing!" and the ominous shake of the lady's head told plainly how she, too, had become fearfully mystified. 
               "Did you inquire for her?" "Yes." 
               "Of whom?" "Of Mrs. Langley herself." 
               "What did she say?" 
               "She said that she had gone into the country." 
               "Just as I expected; but did you see Mr. Langley?" 
               "Yes, I saw him at the fire on Sixth-street." 
               "There was a fire then; I heard the alarm, but thought likely it might be a false one, so did not go out. Was there much damage done?" 
               "A poor woman had her house burned, and every thing she had in it, but what was most distressing, her youngest child was burnt to death before she could rescue it. It was a terrible sight," said the lady, with a deep sigh, proceeding slowly to put away her things; then seating herself by an open window gave her companion a full account of the horrible scene she had witnessed, not omitting the words uttered by Mr. Langley. 
               "The unfeeling wretch!" exclaimed Henry, starting to his feet, and hurriedly pacing up and down the room in the manner of one deeply excited. "Mrs. White," he continued, pausing suddenly, and fixing his burning, penetrating eyes upon the lady, "there is a punishment awaiting that man which he little dreams of, and if there be justice in heaven, it will not be the only one." 
               "It must be a severe one to equal his sins," replied Mrs. W., fanning herself energetically with her pocket-handkerchief. 
               "But you have not given me a full account of your morning's adventure," prompted Henry, drawing a chair close to his companion, so that they might converse in a low tone. 
               "Well, as I have told you, Mrs. Langley said that Louisa had gone into the country; but I don't believe it, for she said it in a hesitating and confused manner, as if she was fabricating a falsehood, and seemed very much excited although she strove to appear calm. Depend upon it, there is something wrong." 
               "Did you inquire where she had gone?" 
               "Yes, but she evaded a reply by making some excuse to leave the room just at that moment, so I was left as much in the dark as before." 
               "And you did not see her again?" 
               "No, not to speak with her, for she seemed very much engaged about her domestic affairs." 
               "Then she has no servant now?" 
               "I think not, for Mrs. McCarty was there washing." 
               "Did you make any inquiries of her?" 
               "No, I was afraid of exciting suspicion if I did." 
               "Do you think that she would be likely to know any thing about it?" 
               "Well, really I can not tell, but I rather think not. I met the boy Dick, as I was coming home, and inquired of him, and all I learned was, that last Tuesday morning he was sent two miles into the country on an errand, and when he returned Louisa was gone, but he did not know where." 
               For some minutes Henry sat silent and thoughtful, consulting in his own mind as to the best course to adopt, in this unlooked-for emergency; the more he thought of it, the more certain he felt that Louisa had not left the city; and that it was quite probable she was still in the house. 
               "Are you acquainted with this Mrs. McCarty?" said he, at length, starting up, as if about testing some new idea. 
               "Not much, I have seen her but two or three times, where she was engaged washing, as that is the business she follows." 
               "I must see her as soon as possible." 
               "But you will not go there to see her?" 
               "No, but I must find out where she lives." 
               "I believe she resides on Columbia-street, but I do not know where. I am completely puzzled what to make of them Langleys anyhow. One day Louisa appears dressed up in more fine things than she ever had in all her life before, and the next she is gone, and no one knows where; but I expect they thought she was going to get married, and they didn't want to give her up yet," and Mrs. White cast a quizzing glance at Henry, as much as to say, "don't you think so too?" but he was too much engaged with his own thoughts to notice the remark, and the good woman left him to his reverie, and went to put away her things and prepare for dinner. 
               Henry Wilson was on the look-out long before Mrs. McCarthy had finished her day's work. At length he had the pleasure of seeing the last piece hung upon the line and the washerwoman woman depart for home. He was soon on her track, nor did he lose sight of her for a moment till she disappeared through her own gate. In a few moments he was at her door, knocking for admittance. He was invited to step in by a little girl, seven or eight years of age, of whom he inquired for her mother. While he was speaking, a middle-aged woman entered from a back apartment, whom he recognized at once as the one he had so closely followed. 
               Henry bowed politely as she entered, and felt reassured by her prepossessing appearance and pleasant salutation of "good evening, sir." She kindly requested him to be seated, in her rich Irish accent, and handed him a chair, making some remarks about the weather, which Henry answered quite contradictory, as his mind ws too intent upon other matters to understand exactly what the remarks were. 
               "I believe you were washing at Mr. Langley's to-day?" said he, as soon as propriety would allow him to put the question. 
               "Yes, Mrs. Langley sent for me to be there yesterday, but I was engaged, and so couldn't go till this morning." 
               "Excuse me, madam, but I wish to know if you can tell me where the girl has gone that has been living there; she is a bound girl, I believe." 
               "Is it Louisa Williams, that ye mane?" 
               "The same." 
               "Sure then, an' if that's what ye'd be afther knowing, ye'll not be likely to find out, for I'm as ignorant as yourself. The lad told me she had gone to the counthry." 
               "Pardon my anxiety, madam, but I have reason to believe that she is now either in that house, or secreted somewhere in the city; the former conclusion I think the most likely." 
                
               "Troth, man, an' surely ye can't be in airnest." 
               "I am," replied Henry, "and as I said before, I have good grounds for such a belief." 
               "Indade! and why should the girl be concealed? shure an' none can spake a harmful word of her, poor crather." 
               "And I believe her to be confined against her will," said Henry, who now felt sure he might be more explicit." 
               "Holy mother, and ye don't mane to be saying that Louisa is shut up like a criminal?" exclaimed the woman, who now began to comprehend something of Henry's meaning." 
               "That is my firm conviction." 
               "Is it so? and what has the poor thing done that she should be trated so shamefully?" 
               "She has done nothing to merit such treatment, believe me, madam; but I have been told that her guardian is very unkind to her, even cruel." 
               "Faith man, an' ye'er right now; I have been acquainted with the girl iver since she was no bigger than my Mary there," pointing to the little girl who had admitted Henry, "and a sorry time she has had of it, poor thing, its little beside hard work, and hard knocks that she's iver known, sure. I don't know what the world is coming to, for it seems to be getting wickeder and wickeder, ivry day, it does." 
               "That may be, because the inhabitants are daily increasing," remarked Henry, with a smile, "but there were always bad people in the world, and it is quite probable there always will be." 
               "Ye spake the truth when ye says that; but it is a shame that the poor girl should be trated so, and it's you that should be afther finding her, the darlint." 
                
               "That is what I intend to do, my good woman, but I may require your assistance, to accomplish that desirable end." 
               "Troth, man, and ye shall not be asking it long, thin, for its Margaret McCarty that'll not be backward in linding a hand to help a friend. But ye'll give your reasons for believing her shut up, surely." 
               "As to that, I can only guess," replied Henry, slightly coloring, "but I fear that I may have been in some way connected with it." 
               "Hoot, man, I see it all now," said the good woman, giving Henry a knowing look, "it's you that would be getting Louisa for a wife; and a blessed on she would make too, ye may be sure; and it's me that would be glad to see her nicely settled; so jist tell me how I can sarve ye, and I'll not be long waiting." 
               "Are you engaged to wash there again?" 
               "Yes, they bade me come the next Tuesday." 
               "And this is Thursday. It seems a long time to wait, but I see no other alternative," sadly rejoined Henry, "but in the meantime I shall not be idle, there may something turn up to explain the mystery of her disappearance sooner, and I trust there will, for this suspense seems almost unendurable." 
               "Surely you have laws in America to punish such injustice." 
               "We have laws in abundance, but it requires an overwhelming amount of evidence to convict the wealthy, particularly when the poor are plaintiffs." 
               "Indade, ye may well say that, for didn't the Langleys rob me of my last penny, or Margaret McCarty would never have been obliged to go out washing to earn bread for the childers," said the poor woman, as she wiped away a tear with the corner of her apron. 
               "Is it possible that you too have felt their merciless grasp?" 
               "Faith then, an' its the truth I will tell ye. My poor husband, Heaven bless his soul, laid by a little from his hard earnings and thought to provide a home for me and the childers; and so he would, too, but for that hard-hearted man that he is. For ye sees he bought a lot of Mr. Langley and paid half the price down, and it was a nice bit of a house he built, for he was a hard worker to be sure, and ye may well say that I was happy then, for I thought there would be no more paying rent; but just before the last payment was due, my poor man took sick and died, and what with paying the doctor's and funeral expenses-for I would have him dacently buried, as he had always been kind to me, and done all he could to make me comfortable-there was not enough left to meet the demand. I thought Mr. Langley would be indulgent to a poor lone woman and rested quite aisy, thinking I could soon earn enough to pay him myself. But troth, ye's may believe me, the very day my poor man's last note was due, I was told to pay every dollar or give up the property. For ye see, the unfeeling wretch, that he is, had bound my poor Jemmy to pay on a certain day, or forfeit the lot and the improvements. I begged him to wait a few weeks and not turn me and the childers into the street: but he was deaf to my pleadings, and I was turned out of doors, and it's only by hard work that I have kept them from starving." 
               "And the poor widow who met with such a terrible calamity this morning, must, in all probability, suffer likewise," thought Henry, as the scene which Mrs. White had witnessed came vividly before him; and he thought of the heartless words she had heard Mr. Langley utter, for he knew that Madam Dubois had also purchased her lot of him, and it was quite certain from what he had said, that he had her as firmly within his power; and he felt a stronger desire then ever to give him a lesson in a like school. "So you do not go there again till next Tuesday," said he, after a few moments of silent reflection, reverting to the business more important to him just then. "I would that the day was not so far off, but we must hide our time, I suppose, and meanwhile I must beg of you to keep the whole matter a profound secret-trust no one, not even your nearest and dearest friend, but follow my injunctions to the letter, or all may yet be lost. Now listen, and I will tell you what I wish you to do. You must note every movement about the house, and hear all that is said. Make every inquiry you can without exciting suspicion, but you must be very cautious and guarded in every thing. If possible, look into Louisa's bed-room, and if an opportunity offers, examine the other rooms, and take particular notice if any of her clothes are there; question the boy as closely as you can, but be very careful and not let them suspect your motive." 
               Mrs. McCarty promised to fulfill his injunctions to the letter, and, after some further arrangements, Henry took his leave, promising to be there on Tuesday evening, and sooner, if he got any new evidence in the case. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XI. 
               SAD and slowly passed the long, wearisome days, as one by one they disappeared on the revolving wheel of time; borne backward as it were, by the great weight of human sorrows and blighted hopes, which had been bequeathed to them by the eager multitude, who were pressing onward in the fruitless race for pleasure and happiness. Those illusive phantoms, which seem almost within our grasp, yet when we reach forth our hands to snatch them, they disappear from sight, for seldom are they possessed; yet the race goes on, exciting and hopeful to the end; lagging not, save when suspense adds its leaden weight to the yearning and overburthened heart. 
               But the welcome day came at length, and the sun, peeping out from behind the screen of forest trees, saw the washer-woman already at her post of duty; and Henry on the lookout from the brow of the hill, impatiently watching the tedious process of washing day. At length it was finished, and his heart throbbed wildly with unintelligible emotions, as he saw Mrs. McCarty depart for home. 
               Scarcely had the washer-woman deposited her sun-bonnet in its accustomed place, ere Henry stood before her, gazing at her flushed face as earnestly as if reading there his book of fate. The case required no preamble, and after requesting him to be seated, Mrs. McCarty proceeded to narrate her day's adventure and discoveries. 
                
               "Troth, man," said she, "I think ye be right in supposing poor Louisa shut up there by them murdering wretches, who call themselves her guardians. Old Maggy had ears and eyes all about her the blessed day, and right sharp was the watch they kept, ye's may well believe." 
               "Did you find out where Louisa is?" impatiently asked Henry, as his friend stopped to see that there were no pictures about that had ears. 
               "Not exactly that, but its sure I am that I discovered her cell, for where a door is bolted on the outside, sure and there's something beyond that they don't mane shall come out. But wait a bit and ye shall hear the whole story. Ye sees, after breakfast I tould the lady that, seeing I had plenty of time, I would just put the things away for her, and save her the trouble, as she must have a deal to do in Louisa's absence, and seeing she was not used to it, it might go hard wid her to get along. So I went about clearing away the dishes, and presently I saw Mrs. Langley pick up some bits of bread and take a cup of cold water in her hand and leave the room; and sure I was listening till I heard her go up the two stairs and unbolt a door, and if I didn't hear somebody speaking wid her, thin my name is not Margaret McCarty." 
               "Could you hear what they said?" 
               "No; the door was closed immediately, and I didn't care to be seen standing there, so I went about my work again. I was only a bit till the lady came below, but she had no cup in her hand now, and she looked pale and worried like. Troth, and I could hardly keep meself from going right up the stairs that instant, and bring the poor crather away wid me, if she be there; but I remembered what ye's told me, and waited a bit till the two were eating their dinner, and sure I put off me ould shoes, and went softly up the two stairs, and as ye be a living man, I saw the bolted door, wid me two eyes; faith and it was hard to keep me hands from tearing it down entirely." 
               "Did you hear any noise within?" 
               "Didn't I hear steps as if some one was walking about the room then, and had a mind to knock at the door, but was afraid they would hear below, and besides, you told me to let you open her prison door your own way, so I didn't stop long till I went down again, and surely none but us be the wiser for it." 
               "You done perfectly right," said Henry, "and I see I have a long account against them, which I must begin to square off immediately: but when do you go there again?" 
               "It's long that I thought ye would not like to be waiting with the poor girl shut up there, so I told them as how I had not much to do, I would jist go there a bit next Thursday,-that's day after to-morrow-and help wid the ironing. Now if old Margaret can assist ye in any way, ye's only to say the word." 
               "I am confident that Louisa is a prisoner in that house, and it seems a long time to have her in captivity, but I see no other alternative, and shall need time for the arrangement of my plans." 
               "But ye may surely go and demand the girl at once," said the washer-woman, becoming impatient with delay, "troth, and its me that'll be wid ye." 
               "The demand would not be complied with, and we have no means of immediately enforcing it. And before we could get the proper authorities to stir in the matter, she might be removed beyond our reach, and thus prolong her captivity and suffering," replied Henry, "and besides, I have reasons for not wishing to be known as taking any interest in the affair. It is better that they should remain ignorant for a time of the manner of Louisa's escape, and likewise of her future residence." 
               "Faith, an' ye's have the best right to know, seeing I'm but a poor, lone woman; but it's no rest, day nor night, I shall have, till the poor body is released," said the good woman, becoming somewhat resigned to the unwelcome procrastination. 
               "When we have a critical job to perform, it is always best to be on the safe side. And as you have had some experience with the customer we have to deal with, you can excuse, what to some, might appear unnecessary cautiousness." 
               "You are right when you say that; though it's impatient I am, to see the blessed darlint again." 
               "I fully appreciate your anxiety," replied Henry, "for you may rest assured that I am not less impatient than yourself; but experience has taught me to guard impetuosity with prudence and judgment; and in this case it is doubly necessary, as we have both cunning and wealth to circumvent. But we will now arrange our mode of operation, as I have much business to attend to between this and Thursday night, and that must be the time to execute our plans, the success of which will greatly depend on your sagacity and forethought, for I shall need your kind service to help me safely through this unexpected difficulty in my mission here. But in good time you shall receive your reward, if success crowns our efforts." 
               "Is it mercenary that ye think old Margaret is, that ye be offering the filthy lucre to pay her for doing her duty to the poor crather that is worse off than meself! Faith and I've half a mind to quarrel wid ye for the impudence ye have," said the washer-woman in a half playful, half offended tone. 
               "Excuse me, my good woman, I did not mean to insinuate any such thing, for I see you have a heart ample enough to hold the interest of a friend, but the time will come when you can better understand me." 
               "Keep your own counsel man, I'm in no want of your secret, only tell me what ye would have me do, and trust me wid my duty, and ye's will see it done, and no thanks to yer bribes." 
               "Well, in the first instance, do you know of any place about the house where I could secrete myself until the family are asleep?" 
               Let me see," said the washer-woman, musingly, "yes, now I have it, there is a bit of a closet under the stairs jist; but troth, it would be but a sad place for one to squeeze thimselves into, if there would be room wid all the rubbish that is there." 
               "We will dispense with comforts, at least, until Louisa is removed from her prison. Now the next thing is can I by any possible means get into that closet undiscovered?" 
               "Sure an' I can think of but one way," replied the good woman, after a few moments consideration. 
               "Let's hear your plan then, for I doubt not but your ingenuity will equal the emergency, by what you have already achieved." 
               "Away wid yer compliments then, and wait a bit, and ye shall see that old Maggy is no fool, though she may not boast of as much wisdom as yourself, for ye s not the man that should wear the coarse duds, a body may well see," said the washer-woman, as she scanned her visitor's dress with a knowing look. 
               "Never mind, but give me the benefit of your woman's sagacity, for I am all impatient to hear your plan." 
               "List then, I will not be there till the afthernoon, and them I'll not hurry with the work, for ye sees I would not lave till quite dark. You can just keep yourself among the bushes, and have an eye to the kitchen window; but mind you must not move until ye sees the light passed three times across it, then meet me at the north-east corner of the house, and I'll be after managing the rest. Ye must never speak a word, but follow me widout making a bit of noise; do ye hear?" 
               "I understand you, and will follow your directions to the letter, but how am I to reach the room with the bolted door?" 
               "Sure and ye can do that same, by climbing the two stairs and then turn to the left. But its softly ye must step, for ye must pass the door to Mr. Langley's bed-chamber." 
               "Trust me. I shall be very cautious," said Henry, rising to depart. "I have much to attend to, and bid you good evening, but I will see you again to-morrow." 
               Henry had barely time to complete his arrangements, and prepare suitable clothing for Louisa; and in this, too, he found his new friend of inestimable service. It was decided that she should be concealed in Mrs. McCarty's house till her removal from the city could be accomplished in safety as to the knowledge of her guardian, and it was necessary for Henry to remain for a time in the neighborhood, to watch the current of affairs. 
                
               Thursday was not so slow in coming as the two friends had anticipated, or a press of business drives old Time at a quicker speed than the indolent hand of leisure. 
               Mrs. McCarty was punctual to her promise, and took her place at the ironing table, with as much zeal as though her every thought and desire centered there, but unlike most persons of her profession, she took remarkable pains to do her work well, regardless of time, for she was in no hurry, notwithstanding, that she did cast an occasional glance at the sun, and then at the basket of unironed clothes, as though she was calculating just how much time it would take to finish her task. Slowly deepened the twilight-so slow that Henry found he had performed a very long and unnecessary journey in passing up and down streets, through alleys, and across vacant shook the last deep fold from her curtain, and shut all objects from view. One by one the clouds came floating up from the West as if nature would favor him in his holy mission to snatch the poor orphan from her cruel oppressor; but Henry sees them not, for his eye is intently fixed on one spot, where he sees a glimmering light. Suddenly he springs from his hiding place, and almost forgets his former caution in his haste, for the welcome signal has been given, and eager for the adventure he stands beside his friend, ready to obey her commands. 
               "It's in luck ye are, for they have company in the parlor," whispered the washer-woman, as she led the way through the back entry to the hall, where, throwing open a small door, she motioned Henry to enter-which he was only able to do in a stooping posture. 
                
               After effecting an entrance, he proceeded quietly as possible, and by degrees, to stow himself away among old shoes, boots, hats, and a variety of cast-off clothing, which people of miserly habits take more pleasure in hauling over occasionally than in passing them over to the poor and needy. The miser never expects to be rich, though surrounded by bags of gold-he only contemplates poverty, and is always making preparation to meet it. The haggard monster stands between him and his useless wealth, and he does not see it. Want stares him in the face-and he anticipates her in his wretchedness. But such are unselfish or insane misers; there are others thoroughly selfish, who provide luxuries for themselves, but take good care not to share them with others, and who will take their only lamb from the poor, rather than one from his own numerous flock. Of this class belonged Mr. Langely; the more his wealth increased, the more covetous and selfish he became. 
               The hope of soon freeing Louisa from her miserable situation, reconciled Henry to his uncomfortable quarters. He could distinctly hear the old-fashioned clock repeat the hours, as, one by one, they slowly departed never more to return. At length the hour of twelve ushered in a new day-a day of joys and sorrows, as each one receives his daily portion from the dispensing hand of Time. To some it was dark and gloomy, to others bright and cheerful. Save the rats, which held their nightly revels, all was hushed and quiet. 
               Each member of the family was lulled to unconsciousness in the arms of Morpheus-if, indeed, the blessing of calm, peaceful sleep is vouchsafed to the cruel, selfish intriguer. Cautiously pushing open the door of his hiding place, and listening intently for a moment, to make sure that all was right, Henry crawled from his concealment, and stealthily groped his way up the stairs. He tried in vain to stifle the beating of his heart, which seriously threatened to arouse, the sleepers, so violent was its throbbing, as his excitement and anxiety increased on nearing the room which would explain the mystery, and expel the doubts and fears that had well-nigh distracted his mind. Safely he reached the bolted door, which his dark lantern enabled him to open without difficulty, and in a moment more he stood within the prison of the orphan girl. 
               He paused, and taking the light from the lantern, held it up to survey the room, which was gloomy enough for the cell of a hardened criminal. But we will not attempt to portray his emotion of mingled joy and indignation, as he beheld the object of his deep solicitude, reclining upon a miserable pallet in the corner of the room. Noiselessly, he approached and bent over her sleeping form; but oh! how changed since he last saw her. That face, then so beautiful, was now pale and emaciated; the bright, beaming eyes were deeply sunken in their sockets, and looked as though they had long been past weeping. 
               His heart grew sick, and his eye dim, as he stood silently contemplating the object before him. Could it be that such human fiends existed? he had read of such, but never before had he witnessed their hellish work. But here, what he had deemed as fiction, was a stubborn fact. Here was an innocent, helpless orphan, being sacrificed to the god of mammon, in the most cruel manner. But his reverie was broken by a, moan, so heart-piercing, that he felt the blood curdle in every vein. He could wait no longer, and kneeling down, he placed his lips close to her ear, and laying his hand upon hers, he softly whispered her name. She partially awoke, and withdrawing drawing her hand, exclaimed in a strangely altered voice: 
               "I will never consent; starve me! kill me! if you will, but never, never, will I marry David Grant." 
               "Merciful Heavens!" mentally ejaculated Henry, "and is this the dark, damnable deed they are committing? Surely Providence has sent, me here to snatch the poor victim from her cold and cruel-hearted murderers, and I shall succeed. They have perjured their souls, and they shall surely have their reward." 
               Shaking her slightly, again he bent down and softly repeated her name. 
               "Who calls?" she said, as she sprung up and gazed wildly around. 
               "Hush! do not speak or they will hear you." 
               "Is it you, Henry, or am I dreaming?" 
               "You are not dreaming now," whispered Henry, as he threw a cloak about her trembling form, and placed a cap upon her head. "Quick now, let us be gone." 
               Placing one arm around her waist, he assisted her to descend the stairs, and in a moment more they might have been seen gliding through the shrubbery toward the open street. 
               Louisa had become so enfeebled by the treatment she had received, that Henry found it necessary to support her whole weight, and to stop frequently, that she might rest and calm her agitation. But the pure, balmy air lent an invigorating influence, and imparted a new energy to her weak and emaciated frame, and her step became more firm as they proceeded on their way towards the home of the washer-woman, who was becoming troubled and impatient at Henry's long absence-fearful lest he had failed in the enterprise. 
                
               But when she saw them approaching, she sprang forward and caught Louisa in her arms, exclaiming, "Heaven bless the darlint! faith, and I was just thinking that I should niver see your blessed face agin, its so long ye were in coming. Sit down, child, while I take off your cloak and cap. Holy mother! and is it sick ye have been? How miserable you look, honey! poor crather they must have starved ye, the wretches!" 
               Louisa wept convulsively; but they were tears of joy, not of sorrow. She had given up all hopes of release, and consigned herself to her fate; spurning her guardian's offers and defying his threats. For a time she had been buoyed up with a belief that Henry would soon come to her assistance, though in what from she had no very definite idea. But as time wore on, and each new day brought only hope deferred, her faith became weaker and weaker, till the last glimmer of hope had well-nigh vanished. But the awful gloom was past and it was all bright now, and she was quite overcome with her emotions and gratitude towards her deliverer. 
               Henry placed a glass of cordial to her lips, and requested her to taste of it, while Mrs. McCarty went about preparing some light food, which she gave her sparingly, and then advised her to try and sleep, while she would sit by and give her a little nourishment, as often as he awoke. 
               The first tint of morning was visible on the Eastern horizon, ere Henry took leave of his two friends, and hastened home to snatch a few moments' rest, after a night of anxiety and watching; but he promised to return early in the evening to see how Louisa was getting on. 
               The poor girl was divested of her soiled garments, and dressed in a clean suit by the kind-hearted washer-woman, who spared no pains to make her comfortable. By evening she had so far recovered her strength as to give Henry a full account of all that had transpired since she last saw him. He was almost stupefied with horror at the recital of her guardian's cruelty, and of her sufferings; and Mrs. McCarty wept like a child, while her indignation would occasionally find vent in invoking the vengeance of Heaven upon her merciless persecutors. 
               "Thank God, ye's be safe now!" she ejaculated after Louisa had finished her narrative; "and if there is law in the land that will punish the murthering wretches, I trust ye's will make them feel its full vengeance, without stint or mercy," continued the indignant washer-woman, turning to Henry. 
               "Leave them to me, I will settle their account one of these days," replied Henry, "but should this affair become known out of the family, you must feign perfect ignorance, as a true knowledge of the facts, if known to Mr. Langely, might prove very injurious to our cause. You had better go there as usual, as your neglect to do so, might create suspicion, and besides, you might hear something that would be to our advantage." 
               "Hoot man, and think ye that old Maggy has not cut her wisdom teeth, nor kissed the blarney-stone?" said the washer-woman with a hasty laugh, as she left the room to attend to her domestic affairs. 
               "Henry, do you think we are safe here?" inquired Louisa of her companion. 
               "Perfectly so, as far as your re-capture is concerned," he replied, "and I have just learned that Mr. Langley has left the city in great haste. Perhaps he was afraid it might become too hot for his comfort." 
               "How long do you think of remaining here?" 
               "A few days only; so soon as you are able to travel, I must remove you to Philadelphia, where you will be properly cared for, and beyond the reach of your guardian." 
               "Is Philadelphia a long way off?" inquired Louisa, in a serious, thoughtful tone. 
               "Yes, a long way, and a wearisome one too; so you will see the necessity of saving all your strength for the journey. But what makes you look so sad? one would think that you were about going to prison, instead of having just escaped from one. 
                      
                        Are you weary of freedom so soon- 
                        Do'st thou sigh for thy fetters again? 
                        Or think thou, the coveted boon 
                        Scarce worth so much labor and pain? 
                     
                   said Henry, in a tone of playful raillery, as he saw the cloud upon Louisa's brow, and the mist gathering in her eyes. 
               "I hope you do not think me so ungrateful," she replied, striving to assume a more cheerful look. "No, I do not sigh for my broken fetters, neither would I be sad, but when I contemplate the unknown future, my heart grows sad in spite of the bright visions before me. And I know not how I can ever repay you fro all your trouble, and the kindness you have shown me, but so soon as I am able to work, I will, at least, relieve you of your unprofitable burthen." 
               "Louisa!" said her companion, pushing back the dark hair from his massive brow, and gazing with tender earnestness into her moistened eyes, "I have a story to tell you, which will, not doubt, surprise you; but not now; wait till you are stronger, and you shall hear all; so cheer up, there is better days coming-days in which the labor of love only will be required of those hands, which I see the hardest drudgery has not quite spoiled. But I must go now," he continued, rising and shaking the hand which he held, "for I have much to do before leaving this city, so you will excuse the briefness of my visit. Good-night." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XII. 
               WHEN Louisa felt herself alone, the pressure of the stillness which gathered about her, forced a sigh from her heavy ladened heart, the audible beating of which seemed to hold her restive thoughts in check, for her past life, like a panorama, seemed unrolled to her view. But her mind dwelt more particularly upon that conversation which she had just held with Henry Wilson, especially upon that portion of it so deeply shrouded in mystery-the story he had promised to tell her!-what could be its import? How came he by it, and why should he take so much interest in her affairs? Surely he must have an object in view. Was it good or bad? What if she should turn out to be some great heiress, or something of that sort; and Henry Wilson a lord or noble in disguise, who, of course, would marry her and make her a great lady, perhaps a queen? Mrs. White had read of such strange things in books, so he had told her. But lords and queens could not be conjured up in this country, particularly in the democratic West; so she would have to be something else. But the story might be only a hoax after all; a sort of will-'o-the-wisp, to entice her feet astray. And thus her thoughts pressed onward like a turbulent stream, whose waters are dashed into spray, or repeatedly turned aside into other channels by the numerous rocks and impediments through which they must make their way. 
                
               But the more she tried to fathom the mystery, the deeper it became, and she turned her thoughts away from the present, and began slowly to unravel the mystic thread of her past life, dwelling carefully upon those parts which seemed more directly pointing to the present. But what causes her to start so suddenly and gaze so long and earnestly into the darkest corner of her little room? Whence comes the fire which lights up that penetrating gaze, and the power which infuses such unwonted animation into her face? Surely we can behold nothing there, save a pair of slippers lying upon the floor and an old black cloke hanging against the wall. 
               Ah, yes, we see the slippers and the cloke, though dimly, for the shadows of a huge chest of drawers and an old brown cupboard, intervening, keep back the light; but Louisa sees them not, though she has gazed full five minutes as if spell-bound, into that same dim corner. What sees she then? and why thus enchanted? I will tell you. As her thoughts wandered back toward the scenes of her childhood, searching diligently for a guiding light, they became suddenly arrested by the image of old Mrs. Dennis, and instantly a new light seemed to break in upon her darkened mind. Nor sufficiently strong, however, to enable to her to read the past and future with certainty; but she was sure that she had found the casket from which was to be drawn the great secret of her life, and hope's bright star shone in upon her soul and suffused her countenance with its fair golden beams. So she was happy. Nor so happy as she would, be, when the secret should be revealed; but she had found an archive of sufficient magnitude and importance to contain the mysterious record, and she felt a pleasant satisfaction that it really existed. It is true, she had not the key to unlock it; but there was one, she was satisfied, that had, and that one was Henry Wilson. Yet had he been present at that moment, and had offered to read her the enigma, I am not sure but that she would have said, "Nay, let me read it for myself;" so delightful is to it indulge in the bright imaginings of a new-born hope. 
               But, perhaps the reader, too, is becoming mystified concerning this new and strange apparition, which so firmly rivets Louisa's attention, and wonders what there is about it that should cause this sudden change to come over the spirit if her dream. Smile, if you choose, dear reader, when we tell you that it is only a playful fancy catching at the bright golden beams of hope, after all. 
               She remembers how very kind old Mrs. Dennis was. How, one day, not long before she went to Philadelphia, she came to see her; how she followed her into the kitchen and said she had something very important to tell her before she went away, and that she-Louisa-must be sure to come and see her. Then she remembered how Mrs. Langely came in and scolded her for being idle, and would not leave her and Mrs. Dennis alone; and how she was beaten when afterward she asked leave to go and see her dear old friend only for half an hour; how the old lady was almost spirited away, her departure was so sudden. Yes, and did not she go to Philadelphia, and was not that the place whence Henry came from, and was going to take her. It might be that she would see her dear friend again; was it likely that he knew her? Yes. She was positive he did; for she remembered the surprise he manifested once when she related to him the fact, of hearing her guardian mention that lady's name, in the private interview with his wife, concerning him. 
               Strange that she had not thought of these things before; and that words, which seemed of no importance when uttered, should seem fraught with such wonderful import now. But we can not tell of all the strange, wild fancies, borne that day, in Louisa's excited imagination; nor pause to read the many little incidents, which she perceived dimly engraved upon her memory, and which delighted her to trace out. Neither have we the ability to describe the many curious air-castles which she reared and demolished, or abandoned ere half finished, for the weakness of their foundations, or ugliness of form. For surely those waking dreams, produced by an over-excited mind, are no less unintelligible and incomprehensible than are those which come to us in our troubled slumbers and which set every known law of reason and philosophy at defiance. 
               "Fetch the gentleman a chair," said Mrs. McCarty to her little daughter, as Henry entered her humble dwelling, the evening after the events just narrated. 
               I was passing here, and thought I would just step in and see how our charge is getting on," said her visitor, as he took the proffered seat. 
               "O, thin, she is doing finely, under old Margaret's care!" replied the kind-hearted washerwoman, "and will be herself again in a few days." 
               "Indeed, I am glad to hear it, and must ask your permission to have a little private conversation with her, on business affairs, if you think her strong enough to bear it." 
               "Ye's may just walk in, and judge for yourself, thin, but ye'll pledge me that your business shall be agreeable to the poor child," said Mrs. McCarty, with a very knowing twinkle of her blue eye. 
               "O, certainly, said Henry, bowing and closing the door after him. 
               Louisa was seated in an old-fashioned rocking chair, one elbow resting upon the high arm, her head slightly raised from the hand on which it had been reposing, was bent forward in a listening attitude, for her ear had caught the sound of Henry's voice, while a faint crimson glow was lighting up her pale, thoughtful features, causing her to appear more beautiful than the had ever before seen her. 
               "I am happy to find you looking so well," said Henry, as he took a seat near her; "but I had hoped to find you looking more cheerful. I hope you do not desire to return to your old servitude," continued he, gazing earnestly into her sad face. 
               "I certainly do not," replied Louisa, assuming a more cheerful look, "but I can not help feeling sad and lonely, after all; perhaps it is these shadows of uncertainty which cause this gloom to fall upon me, in spite of all my efforts to cast it aside." 
               "Very likely, and it is to dispel these same shadows that I have now called upon you. Doubts and uncertanties are very unpleasant companions, at least such they have been to me, and I feel much happier now that I am rid of them; but do you think yourself strong enough to take charge of the secret that I am about to reveal?" 
               "I can bear anything better than this painful suspense," replied the orphan girl, "and am sure that I shall feel better to know the truth, be it good or evil." 
               "Listen then, and be calm," said Henry, drawing his seat close to Louisa, that his words might not reach other ears, "you are the rightful and lawful owner of the greater portion of your guardian's immense wealth." 
               "You can not be in earnest!" said Louiza, bending forward, with her astonished and eager gaze riveted upon the sincere face of her companion. 
               I speak truly." 
               "Henry, tell me positively, are you not jesting?" 
               "My mission here is not to deceive you, and I trust that I have never done so in any one instance," replied Henry, with an earnest, dignified look. 
               "Never to my knowledge," said Louiza, "but your words are beyond my feeble comprehension, and I cannot fully understand them." 
               "Let me explain them, for I see that you still persist in doubting my words, by the uncertainty expressed in your face, and I trust that I shall succeed in convincing you," said Henry, smiling. 
               "Have you no knowledge of your father once owning a farm near this city." 
               "None." 
               "Such was the fact, and at his death, (your mother having died a short time previous,) you were the sole heir; Cincinnati was only a thriving village then, and the property lying in what at that time was considered a very unpromising locality, it was not thought of much value; but time has brought great changes, and that little hillside farm in now a part of this great city." 
               "But how did Mr. Langley acquire possession of it?" 
               "By a tax, title, and by being your guardian." 
               "Pardon my curiosity, but I am anxious to know from whom you ascertained these facts," said Louiza, gazing into her companion's face. 
               "I got them from various sources, but principally from a lady by the name of Dennis, perhaps you may remember her?" 
               "I remember her very well," said Louiza, "and this, then, is the secret she wished to tell me," she continued musingly. 
               "Yes, she told me she had sought many opportunities to inform you of it, but that she was thwarted in all her attempts, by your watchful guardian, and his equally vigilant wife." 
               "Is Mrs. Dennis still living?" 
               "No; she has been dead now about six months. It was only a few days previous to her death that she sent for me, and gave me such facts in your history as has led to the discovery of the rest, and she exacted a promise from me that I would come to this city to look after you and your interests, for she was firmly impressed with the idea that your guardian intended to rob you; which promise I have kept, and you are aware how far I have succeeded in the business." 
               "Why did she keep the secret so long from you?" 
               "Alas! she too was in the power of that black-hearted man, who has caused you so much suffering," replied Henry. "She was hurried away from this city in the charge of a man who bore the title of Dr. Furgerson, but whether that was his real name or not she never knew. He was to take her to her brother, who was residing in Philadelphia; but what was her surprise and dismay when she found herself incarcerated in a private lunatic asylum, you can but faintly comprehend. She used every effort to escape, but all in vain, till a few weeks before her death; when by the merest accident her brother, whom I learn is now dead, became aware of the facts and procured her release." 
               "What a web of villainy," exclaimed Louisa, as she wiped the moisture from her eye, "truly that man's sins are as the sands of the sea." 
               "And a fearful penalty awaits him, for God has declared that the will punish according to the transgression of men, and none shall escape it," replied Henry, but his time has not yet fully come." 
               "But are you sure that the property can be recovered?' inquired Louiza. 
               "I have examined the case pretty thoroughly, with the assistance of Mr. Allen, and think that with proper management the greater part of it may, but nothing can be done safely till you are of age." 
               "And you think it best that I should go to Philadelphia?" 
               "I do, and hope you will acquiesce in my judgment." 
               "I should be ungrateful not to do so, after all the trouble you have experienced in my behalf," said Louiza, slightly coloring, "and who else can I look to for advice and counsel." 
               "Louisa-excuse me-Miss Williams, I suppose I must now call you, as you are no longer a poor bound-girl, but an heiress, rest assured that whatever confidence you may see fit to place in me, will be religiously respected." 
               "Since you were worthy of my friend's confidence, you are surely entitled to mine, and I shall be guided by your superior judgment in all things." 
               "Certainly you flatter me," said Henry, taking Louisa's hands between his own, "and I hope that you will not think me entirely mercenary, when I confess to you that I feel a deep interest in your welfare-something more than mere friendship. Yet I should not now have mentioned it, but I have not been so blind as not see that I have touched a responsive chord in your own bosom. But time may bring changes, and we will leave the subject for further reflection, and I wish to leave you free from all engagements; as with a change of circumstances may come a change of feelings. And for one year at least, I would have your mind unoccupied with other thoughts than that of study; as it is my intention to place you at a boarding school, and I trust you will have no objections to the arrangement." 
               "But remember my wealth is only in the prospective, it is still beyond my reach, and how am I to meet the expenses that I shall be subjected to?" 
               You shall not want for means; so make yourself easy about that." 
               "Is it right that I should be a burthen to others?" 
               "I believe you just promised to be guided by my judgment, and you question it already," said Henry, assuming a very serious look. 
               "Excuse me, I did not intend to do so, the insult was quite unpremeditated I assure you," rejoined his companion, in a half-playful, half-serious tone. 
               "I will pardon you this time," said Henry, smiling, "and trust that you will not re-commit the same offence, when I tell you, you had better retire, for you have already had too much excitement. So good-by, and pleasant dreams to you." 
               Louisa sought her pillow and tried to sleep, but in vain, for the strange revelation she had heard, haunted her, in spite of all her efforts to drive it away. Sometimes she fancied she had been dreaming; then, she would call to mind each part of the conversation to assure herself it was no cheat of the fancy; but as the reader can better imagine her thoughts and feelings than I can describe them, I will leave him or her to do it after their own liking. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               WHEN Henry left Louisa he hastened to the office of his friend and counsellor, Mr. Allen, who assured him that he had found every thing to their satisfaction, and all that was now necessary was to keep Mr. Langley ignorant of their movements, and quiet his fears, lest he might be induced to cover up his property and force them into a tedious law-suit with persons entirely innocent of wrong, and who believed the titles to the property purchased of Mr. Langley to be correct. Allen was to keep a close watch over Langley's actions, and keep Henry fully advised thereof. 
               Every thing was now arranged for his departure so soon as Louisa should become strong enough to perform the journey; and that would require a great deal of strength and endurance-for a journey over the mountains, in those days of stage coaches and execrable roads, was a very different thing from a journey now, when we are whirled along by the magic of steam so swiftly and smoothly that we are hardly cognizant that mountains lay in our way. 
               Louisa recovered rapidly, now that doubts and fears no longer weighed upon heart, and cheerfulness-that great promoter of health-enlivened her bosom. 
               Mrs. White and Mrs. McCarty lent their assistance in preparing her wardrobe and such other comforts as her journey would require, and a few days thereafter she was on her winding way to other and far more pleasant scenes. 
               Reader, we will now pass over one year, and again introduce you to the orphan; but now no longer the poor bound-girl, for she has just entered her nineteenth year. Behold her fair, clear brow, with glossy ringlets, veiling her snowy neck and glowing cheeks; while her dark eyes beam with the intelligence of a noble and elevated womanhood. Every feature has received the softening and beautifying influence of sympathy and refinement; the hard, rough lines, chiseled by the hand of neglect and abuse, have been smoothed out by kindness. There may be a slight shade of sadness detected on her features, but it has no mingling of frowning discontent, as she sits by the open casement, her head resting upon a hand no longer browned and hardened with toil and exposure, but of the most delicate texture and finish. The room is neat and tastily furnished, and from the window where she sits, a beautiful prospect is spread out before her. The village of C-- with its tall spires towering Heaven-ward; its snow-white cottages nestled away among the rich blooming shrubbery and creeping vines, overshadowed with the more stately forest trees, waving their bright green foliage to the playful breeze, like guardians of a fairy land. Just on the outskirts of the village rises the graceful outlines of the thriving institution where Louisa has diligently pursued her studies since she left her native city. It is now vacation. The halls of the seminary are silent and still. The pupils have repaired to their homes to enliven the maternal mansion with their merry voices. But Louisa remains; she has no relative to meet her at the threshold and welcome her home. 
                
               It is no wonder that in hours of reflection she feels sad and solitary; for the heart ever yearns for congenial companionship and sympathy, for some near and dear friend to share its joys and its sorrows. Oh! it is sad to go out all alone in this "wide, wide world," and engage in the great battle of life, with none to cheer us with a kindred smile. No, it is no wonder that Louisa felt sad when she thought of her lonely and isolated life. She is musing upon it now, and a tear glistens in her eye, though she may be unconscious that it is there. At her feet lies a guitar, on which she has been discoursing sweet music, and which has awoke in her mind a train of deep meditation, till every scene of her past eventful life comes crowding through her brain; each thrilling a responsive chord, until a tear, a sigh, has consecrated its memory. All these distorted visages passed hastily before her mind's eye, and she shrinks from beholding them, and hurries on to contemplate brighter scenes. Brighter, but alas! they are not without a shadowing of doubts and fears. Her whole soul seems absorbed in this waking dream. "It is strange!" she mentally exclaimed, "strange, that in all the letters he has written me, there has been no word, no sentence uttered to shed light on this darkness of doubt which preys like a vulture on my sad heart. Friendship, warm and unchanging, is wafted to me with each kind missive, yet it chills my heart like the cold breath of winter. Once, only, have I beheld him since first my eyes rested on yon glowing landscape. Then, as now, the setting sun cast a bright mantle over the beautiful scenery till it seemed lit with the golden lamps of Paradise. Yet it seems less lovely now. Perhaps it was his glowing eloquence that then imparted to each gorgeous hue, a double brilliancy for my enraptured gaze. Now the shadows from my own sad heart seem to envelop all in a misty gloom of uncertainty. Yet I cannot believe him changed, and he once spoke words that sent a thrill of rapture through every vein. Perhaps he thinks the rich heiress has not the same affection that kindled in the bosom of the poor orphan; yet how gladly would I again be the poor friendless bound-girl if that alone could secure his sympathy-his love. But he comes to-night, and my brow must not be clouded. And that song he sent me, let me run over it once more, for he said I must sing it to him." She bent forward, and taking up her guitar, struck a sweet and melancholy air, while her rich voice poured forth the following simple yet touching words. They were addressed to herself: 
                      
                        I have come to thy bower of love, 
                        While the moon-beams so softly are glancing; 
                        As the smiles from the angles above, 
                        And the stars on the wavelets are dancing 
                        All lovely and bright, 
                        On this calm Summer night, 
                        As thy dark eye so sweetly entrancing. 
                     
                      
                        At thy feet let me kneel and adore 
                        The image that lives in my breast; 
                        And gaze on thy face evermore, 
                        O, then will this heart be at rest, 
                        From thy presence of love 
                        No more I would rove, 
                        No more with sad doubts be oppressed. 
                     
                      
                        Then lightly and softly we'll glide 
                        O'er the bosom of life's flowing river; 
                        Rocked gently to rest by the tide, 
                        With no shipwrecks our fortunes to sever, 
                        Till our spirits shall soar 
                        To eternity's shore, 
                        To join in sweet anthems forever. 
                     
                  
                
                
               "Beautiful! you could not have sung it better," exclaimed a rich, manly voice, as the last tone melted away, with the gentle sigh that went out from the bosom of the orphan to accompany it on its hold mission of love. 
               "Henry-Mr. Wilson!" was the startled ejaculation of Louisia, as she arose and extended her hand to welcome her visitor. 
               "Dearest Louisa! for so I must address you, you know not how happy you have made me," said Henry, clasping her proffered hand in both of his own, and pressing it fervently to his lips, "I was fearful the song would be forgotten; but your voice improved it wonderfully." 
               "You surely could not deem me so regardless of your wishes as to neglect your request, nor myself so heedless of my promise as to forget it," said Louisa, blushing. 
               "Changes of fortune and of times, bring changes of favor." 
               "That will not apply to me," said Louisa, in a voice which betrayed the secret of her heart. 
               "You are mine then, mine forever" exclaimed Henry, clasping to his bosom the trembling orphan, and the tears that moistened his eyes were the gushing forth of that fountain of deep affection which had long been gathering strength in his heart. 
               The misty shadows floated away from Louisa's mental atmosphere, and the golden rays of hope shone in upon her heart with all the brightness and beauty of a perfect love, thrilling it with that intensity of happiness known only to the virtuous and good. 
               We will not tell of the future now, for to them the present is too beautiful-too holy to be desecrated by wordly cares, a period of happiness for which a life time might be sacrificed. So we will leave them to partake of love's blissful draught alone. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               IT was a chill, murky day in November; dark gray clouds, like an army of crusaders, moved, sullen and grim, through the heavens, on their pilgrimage to the east; their thick banners shutting away the warm sunshine from the poor unfortunate ones who were shivering 'neath the cold blasts of poverty and want, and causing deeper sadness to fall upon the hearts of the sorrowing. Mrs. Langley sat alone in the deep solitude of her chamber, communing with her own soul. Darker and denser than those without, were shadows which lay upon her heart, for a few days previous she had lain the last of her offspring in the silent tomb. Fierce and terrible as the withering blast from the icy north, had been the last coming of the death-angel, and with one sudden stroke left her only the crushed and mangled form of her child; he had been killed by the running away of a frightened team; and thus from her heart's altar had been torn its last human idol, for her affections reached not out beyond the borders of self, and conjugal love had found only a cold lodgment in her heart. It is true that her wedded life had not been marked with those fierce jarings and bitter discords which sometimes covert the heaven of home; into a pandemonia of hell, but a cold, stern, calculating atmosphere had congealed the wellsprings of sympathy, and blasted the germs of friendship. So there was found no kind, consoling voice to smooth down the rough edges of her sorrow, no gentle influence breathed peace to her troubled soul; for she sought no sympathy, neither human nor divine, but her thoughts went down into the darkness, and solitude of her own soul to find congenial companionship in its chilling desolation. 
               At length she arose, and stealing noiselessly across the room, unlocks a drawer, and after looking cautiously around to make sure that no eye saw her, she took therefrom a heavy box, and glided ghost-like back to her seat. Unlocking it, she commenced eagerly counting the bright golden pieces it contained. As her eyes gloated over the hoarded wealth, a gleam of joy for the first time lit up her cold, stern face. That box contained her only idol now. Yes, enshrined amid the cold shadows of her heart, stands the golden calf on its icy pedestal; the creature of her worship-the center of her hopes, and the balance power of her mind. 
               It is painful to contemplate the wreck of a human soul, amid icebergs of selfishness, and we turn away with a mingled feeling of pity and disgust. 
               The sharp tinkling of the silver tea-bell startled Mrs. Langley from her pleasing occupation, and carefully putting away her treasure under its double lock, she descended to the supper room. A cold formal not was the only greeting which passed between Mr. Langley and his wife as they took their seats at the tea-table. The repast was but lightly partaken of, for neither the gentleman nor lady seemed to have any relish for food. At length Mr. Langley pushed aside his plate, and resting his elbows upon the table, sat with his face burried in his hands as if in deep meditation. Mrs. Langley, with folded arms resting upon the tea-tray, sat silently regarding him with an expression of subdued curiosity. At length a sound which seemed to combine an oath and a groan, escaped as if unguardedly from his lips, and startled him from his thoughtful posture. The eyes of the two met, but nothing of sympathy was telegraphed in their keen glances. On the contrary, those of the lady seemed to flash forth a gleam of satisfied misery with congenial companionship, while those of the gentleman darted back vexation and defiance. Mr. Langly arose from the table and walked hurriedly up and down the room for a few minutes, as if striving to rid himself of the thoughts which were haunting him. Then throwing himself into a chair he exclaimed, half musingly: "The hag, I wish I had never seen her!" 
               "Ah! what is the trouble now?" enquired his wife, fixing her sharp, grey eyes upon her husband's face. 
               "O, that crack-brained madam Dubois; I wish the devil had her." 
               "Why, what has she been doing now; pointing you out with her long, bony finger to a group of angry imps, as she did in your dream the other night?" queried the lady, becoming a little excited about the edges of her curiosity. 
               "Worse than that even! She actually got after me, and chased me through several streets, pointing at me, what I thought at first to be a pistol, but which afterwards proved to be a prayer book and a wooden cross, that she usually carries." 
               "To frighten away the devils, I presume," remarked the wife in a significant tone, "But is the woman really crazy?" 
               "You would have thought so, I guess, had you seen her today, rigged out in her fancy costume; her great crimson hat decorated with ribbons and feathers of the most gaudy colors; her sky-blue dress, spangled with stars, and a bright yellow sash, which streamed out behind; altogether giving her the appearance of a fiery comet with two tails, as she darted after me. The bevy of boys which were following her through the streets, joined in the race like a pack of curs; all yelping and screaming to the top of their lungs, catch him! catch him!! which ever way I turned to escape them. I encountered an army of people running to see what the matter; for I verily believe that half of the people in the city happened just then to be in the neighborhood, all gaping and grinning as if it had been some great show." 
               "I should judge it was, and exhibited gratis," remarked Mrs. Langley. 
               "After running the gauntlet until I was nearly out of breath," continued Mr. Langley, "I succeeded, by means of the crowd, to escape the vigilance of the mob at my heels, by slipping into a back yard and hiding in an empty sugar hogshead." 
               "Is there no law to restrain such creatures?" inquired Mrs. Langley, now beginning to imbibe a little of her husband's spirit of indignation. 
               "Yes, when the people vote them disturbers of the public peace." 
               "Well, was not the public peace disturbed to-day. 
               "Not painfully so, but mine was, and if she ever attempts to repeat the act; I shall make a law of myself, said Mr. Langley, giving his closing remark a peculiar emphasis, and then compressing his lips into thoughtful silence. 
               The lady relapsed into a moody spirit also; for the remark of her husband seemed likewise to have given her food for cogitation, and it is not unlikely that their minds were busy with the same train of thoughts. 
                
               "How strange it is that we have never yet been able to learn anything concerning Louisa Williams, nor how she escaped from us," said Mr. Langley, after he had sat a long time communing with his thoughts. 
               "It is indeed mysterious," remarked the wife, in a slightly trembling voice, as if the demons of fear and remorse were being aroused in her bosom at the mention of that name. 
               "There was something too, so singular in the conduct of that Henry Wilson, I never could account for it." 
               "Neither could I, and I wonder what became of him?" 
               "Why, he is in Philadelphia." 
               "How did you hear that?" 
               "I saw and conversed with a gentleman from that city, a few days ago, who knows him, and reports him to be a lawyer of the first class, and highly esteemed." 
               "But you never mentioned it before." 
               "No." 
               "Did you ever inquire if Wilson was married?" 
               "Yes, but he told me he was not." 
               "Strange! I have ever been under the impression that he was in some way connected with Louisa's escape." 
               "So have I, and expected to hear from her when she became of age; but it is nearly six month since she was eighteen." 
               "It does seem mysterious!" and Mrs. Langley drew a long breath, for the uncertainty was becoming quite insupportable. 
               "One thing is certain," remarked Mr. Langley, "Wilson had some secret object in view, or he would not have come here in disguise, and paid his addresses to that girl. He wanted money more than he wanted a wife, you may be sure; but I presume he found her affairs too desperately tangled even for a "Philadelphia lawyer." What surprises me most is, that if he, or any one else, were knowing to the particulars of the girl's imprisonment, that there has never been any stir about it." 
               "That is the most singular of all, and I am inclined to believe still, that Louisia made her escape entirely unaided, though in what manner seems truly unaccountable." 
               "And in all probability we shall never know." And Mr. Langley pushed his bushy locks back from his forehead and temples, while a faint smile told that he had come to a very satisfactory conclusion, for "ignorance might to bliss" in their case; and taking his hat he strolled out upon the lawn, to enjoy the dreamy solitude of an Autumn eve, and to soothe the conflicting elements that were struggling in his bosom. Mrs. Langley did not feel quite satisfied about the matter, though she strove to be hopeful, but some how her thoughts would cling to the subject, notwithstanding she tried to drive it from her mind by examining the cactuses and a beautiful monthly rose that stood by an open window, and looked proudly out, with its bright blossoms tinged with the glow of a radiant twilight. But the beauty and sweetness of the rare blossoms could not dispel that vague impression that haunted her-that something unpleasant was about to happen. Reader, you may smile at what you may please to call "an old woman's whim," yet there are few persons but what have at times felt a presentiment of evil, that made them feel sad and restless in spite of their repeated assurance that it was nothing. I have often thought that, from these silent whisperings to the mind, first came the belief of guardian angels hovering and watching over us, to guide us in our duty, and warn us of impending evil; for such warnings do come in sleeping and waking visions, and fix themselves upon the imagination so firmly, that no reasoning can entirely shake them off. But Mrs. Langley did succeed in reasoning herself into something like a satisfactory belief, that they had now nothing to fear from a reappearance of Louisa, though hope may have been the strongest part of the argument. But alas, for her and her husband too! They were doomed to a fearful disappointment, for while they were holding their little family tete-a-tete, the arrival of Mr. Wilson and lady, was being registered at the Dennison House, No.-, Main street. 
               On the following morning, just as Mr. Langley had finished his last cup of coffee, and was glancing over the news paragraphs of the morning paper, a note was handed him by a servant-and as he hastily ran over its contents, his face became livid, his eye wild with ferocious timidity, and his whole frame convulsed with the workings of an intense excitement. 
               "Mercy of me! what is it; what can be the matter?" almost shrieked Mrs. Langley, and unable to endure the dreadful suspense longer, she sprang forward and leaned over her husband's shoulder, while her eyes vainly sought to read the crooked and detached characters before her. 
               "It is all out, the mystery is solved!" groaned Mr. Langley, and he tore the unwelcome billet into fragments and scattered them about the room. 
               "Good Heavens! what is to be done?" and Mrs. Langley looked like the statue of despair; her features rigid as marble, with her hands tightly clenched; her colorless lips pressed firmly together, and her eyes staring at vacancy, or rather the ghost of her imagination, which looked fearful enough as it glanced from the high position where she stood, down to the awful chasm of ruin and disgrace. 
               "What it to be done?" repeated Mr. Langley, "why that note demands the immediate payment of One Hundred Thousand Dollars, to Henry Wilson, now the husband of Louisa Williams; and in case the demand is not immediately complied with, a prosecution is threatened, and a full disclosure of all the facts made public." And Mr. Langley strode up and down the room in a paroxysm of rage and mortification, bordering upon insanity. 
               "We are ruined, then!" exclaimed the terrified woman, as infamy and disgrace seemed staring them in the face; "is there no help? Can he compel you to pay it?" 
               "There is but the one alternative, the money must be paid," replied Mr. Langley, in a voice calm only through despair. 
               "Are you sure that he can recover it?" 
               "I am; and resistance would only cause a shameful exposure. I wish now that I had made a sure job it, and not left even one to tell the tale," said Mr. Langley, while the fearful expression that rested on his countenance, made even his wife shudder. 
               "Should the money be paid as requested, would the whole transaction be kept a secret?" inquired Mrs. Langley, after a few moments of reflection. 
               "Wilson pledge his word and honor that such shall be the case." 
               "How are you to meet the demand, it will ruin us?" 
               "I shall be obliged to sell off property at a great sacrifice, but it must be done." 
               After making many great sacrifices, and running the guantlet let of the money market, Mr. Langley succeeded in raising the amount demanded by Henry Wilson. But the hand of the avenger was upon him, and, although for a time he seemed to recover from the shock, yet one by one, his ill-gotten possessions were wrenched from him, till broken in spirits, as in fortune, he sought the wine-cup, in hopes to drown the accusing demon in his breast. Vain hope! for he may still be seen wandering through the streets, haggard and care-worn; often pausing to look around him, as if fearful of being pursued by some goblin of his brain, or peering with his bloodshot eyes, into dark alleys and recesses, looking for the bony finger which he expected to see pointed at him; then shrinking into himself, as it were, he crawls away to his lair alone and unnoticed, save by the finger of pitying scorn, which points him out as a warning to those who do evil in making haste to be rich. 
               But what of his companion in wickedness? Alas! the balance to her mind having been struck away, reason tottered and fell, and she is now the sole occupant of a low, dismal chamber, in a dilapidated tenement which yet remains to them. Her eyes, lit with madness, are still gloating over her treasure; for the most of her time is spent in counting slowly, one by one, a quantity of pebbles, which, with her shrivelled fingers, she puts carefully into a box. 
               Would you like to know more of Henry Wilson and the Orphan Bound-Girl? Go to Philadelphia, and there, among the wealthiest, the most respected and loved, you will find them, blessed of Heaven, and honored by all who know them. Happy in doing their duty to the world, and to their fellow-creatures. And a yearly stipend, which allows her many luxuries of life, tells that the washer-woman was not neglected in their prosperity. 
               Mrs. White has been prosperous in a second union, and her husband is not only numbered amongst the wealthiest of the city, but among the most honored and respected also; and she is now reaping the reward of a good life, in a happy old age. 
               As for David Grant, poor fellow, the terrible fright which he got, proved a death blow to all future anticipations of matrimony, and he lived content with the meager comforts of a bachelor's life; and a few years since was peacefully gathered to his fathers.
