"Lightly thou say'st that woman's love is false, The thought is falser far- For some of them are true as martyrs' legends, As full of suffering faith, of burning love, Of high devotion-worthier of heaven than earth, O, I do know a tale!"--Maturin's Bertram. T was a glorious winter's night; from a sky of deepest blue, where golden stars were shining, and soft, fleecy-like clouds floated dreamily along, the beautiful moon looked down upon hill and valley, field and meadow, dressed in robes of purest white, which glistened in her pale rays; on ice-bound rivers, on forests waving their leafless branches in the wind, and on the silent streets of the little town of Chilford, one of our pretty western villages situ- ate upon the banks of a clear and rapid stream, that after pursuing its winding way through a portion of two of our States, at length loses itself in the waters of Lake Michigan. The town-clock was striking the midnight hour, as a merry sleighing party entered the principal street, the lively jingle of the sleigh-bells mingling with the more musical notes of soft girlish voices, and the deeper tones of those of the stronger sex; all blending harmoniously in the chorus of one of the popular songs of the day. In the family sitting-room of a dwell-   ing whose exterior and surroundings seemed to bespeak its occupant one of the wealthier class, a lamp was burning brightly, the rays of light stealing through the half:closed shutters and falling upon the snow-covered piazza and the lawn beyond. In front of this house, one of the sleighs presently drew up, and several gentlemen springing to the ground, assisted three young ladies to alight, and accompanied them to the door, which opened just as the foremost couple set foot upon the piazza; seeing which the gallant escort bade good- night and withdrew, while the girls tripped into the hall, and the door closed upon them. It was a fine-looking woman, in the prime of life, andunmistakably a lady, who had admitted them, and who, as she turned to secure the fastenings of the door, asked in kind, motherly tones, "Well, my dears, had you a pleasant time?" "Oh, very!" "Perfectly delightful!" "Very pleasant, indeed!" answered the three, all speaking at once, the eldest adding, "But we're so sorry to have kept you up so late, Aunt Maria." "Always so thoughtful for others, Lilian," returned Mrs. Lambert, with an affectionate look and smile, as she, led the way into the cosy, comfortable sitting-room; "but I have really quite 3     enjoyed having a quiet hour or two to s myself; I've written several longletters a which have been troubling my, con- ' science for months."        I "Then somebody will have reason to e be glad that we' did keep you up, a mother, and so we'll not fret about it," e remarked the youngest of the party, a l slight, fairy-like damsel of eighteen. } "You can make it up by an after- 1 dinner nap to-morrow, can't you?"  c "If I feel the need of it. But, Meta, child, don't pull off your wraps' yet; a you'll be much less likely to take cold : if you keep them on for a few minutes." ' "I'm not the least bit cold; but shall 1 do as I'm bid, like the good child that I always am," returned the lively girl, I drawing more closely about her slender form the heavy shawl she had, half thrown off. "Well, I confess to being somewhat chilled; sufficiently so at least to find your warm room very comfortable, aunt; and your bright, blazing fire something to be thankful for," said Lilian, seating herself before it as she spoke. Lilian Duncome was not beautiful, but there was something very attractive in her face. It was full of sweetness and intelligence, and lighted up by a pair of remarkably fine grey eyes, so dark, and so shaded by their heavy silken fringes as to be not unfrequently mistaken for black. She had a- fair  complexion, abundance of soft brown hair, a neat, trim figure, and looked to be about twenty. "I am glad you appreciate them," said her aunt. "You must all get well warmed before you go to your rooms." "Thank you, aunt, we will; but don't let us keep you up any longer." "'Hush, Lil, let mother stay; she doesn't look a bit tired or sleepy, and   shan't be sent off to bed in that fashion, and made to wait till to-morrow to hear all about our grand frolic," said Meta, playfully pushing her parent into an easy-chaii'. Then throwing off her hood and shawl; asserting that she was warm enough now to do so with perfect im- punity, she placed herself on a stool at, her mother's feet, and laid her pretty head, with its abundant wealth of flaxen curls, on her knee. "You are not tired, mother mine, are you? and don't wish to resign yourself to the arms of Morpheus yet, do you?" she added, in the coaxing tones of a petted child, and looking up with such a beautiful smile on her rosy lips, and in her merry blue eyes, as few mothers could have resisted. Mrs. Lambert passed her hand lightly over the rosy cheek and sunny hair of her darling, and bending down pressed a fond kiss on the pure white brow. "Lilian is very kind and thoughtful," she said, " but I am not sensible at tliis moment of either fatigue or drowsiness; and shall stay to hear the story I see you and Florence are burning to tell I me." And she glanced smilingly at her youngn, niece, a gay, handsome bru- nette, who had thrown herself into a large, softly cushioned chair on the rother side of the fire&, and was lounging rback in it, resting a pair of remarkably r prettily shaped and neatly booted feet t on the top of the fender. )  Florence \Vas quite conscious of the beauty of her foot, and seldom missed ' an opportunity to display it. t  "May we tell, Lil?" she asked, with r a mischievous look at her sister. "What is there to tell, Flo?" re- t turned the other, while a soft blush mantled her fair cheek. e  "Oh, a good deal,' cried Meta, d, clapping her hands with a merry, ring-   ing laugh. "Mother, Lil has certainly ( made a conquest, and I am already 3 looking forwaLrd to long delightful visits to Chicago, and to a beautiful country-seat on the lake shore." "And  I  too," said Florence. "Wouldn't it be splendid if I should become the belle of Chicago? I hope you have no thought of disappointing us, Lil." "O girls, what nonsense!" answered Lilian, with some vexation in her tone. "Come, let us go to our beds, it is after one," she added, glancing up at the clock on the mantelpiece. "Not yet; we are not half warmed," said Meta. "Mother, don't you think Mr. Dana would be an excellent match 'for Lil? and that she ought to accept him? Who could think of refusing? And I'm sure he'll offer before long, so atten- tive as he was to-night." "O Meta, how absurd to imagine for a moment that he can have any such intentions. Why, he is old enough to be my father-wa:s my father's friend, and knew me as a little school- girl when he had a wife and child." "That might weigh with you as a reason for rejecting an offer from him, Lilian," said her aunt, smiling, "but \ w6uld hardly prevent him from making it; for do you not know, my dear, that the older a man is, the younger he usually wants his wife tobe?" "To be sure he does," said Florence, laughing; "and then, Lil, how much better to be an old man's -darling, than a young man's slave." "I should rather be neither," said Lilian, rising and lighting a candle; "and don't think I shall ever be com- pelled to take either horn of the di- lemma. However, I. am 'not going to reject the man until :he offers himself, which I hope and believe he never will.   Good-night, and pleasant dreams to you all." "How pretty and sweet she is!" said Meta, as the door closed upon her' cousin. "I don't wonder that the beaux lose their hearts." "Nor that Mr. Dana thinks-as I am sure he does, let her say what she will-that she would grace the head of his establishment. And wouldn't she? Now, I should like to see her there!" exclaimed Florence, with a proud smile. "I hope that is not all he thinks of in seeking her,". said Mrs. Lambert. "Our Lilian has a gentle, sensitive, clinging nature that can never be happy without love." "I think she has inspired it at first sight, in one breast at least," remarked Meta.  "Did you notice, Flo, how that handsome young stranger kept his eyes on her? Nobody need tell me he went home heart whole to-night." "Pshaw!!" cried Florence, pettishly, "I hope Lil will never look at him. Why, he's as poor as a church mouse. Harry Griswold told me all about him." "You don't believe in love in a cot- tage, or any such nonsense, do you, Flo?" laughed Meta. "Who, and what is he?" asked Mrs. Lambert. "His name is Aubrey Falconer; he has lately been admitted to the bar, and has come here to begin the prac- tice of law," replied Florence, coldly; "he has educated himself, and is now starting in the world with nothing but his wits to depend upon; at least so Harry told me." "His brains rather," said Meta; " he looks as if they were not wanting." "Poor young fellow!" sighed kind- hearted Mrs. Lambert; " he deserves a great deal of credit for his exertions,     and I hope he will succeed in getting into practice. But we can't let him have Lilian until he is able to keep her comfortably-supposing you are right in thinking he lhas fallen in love with her," she added, with a little laugh. They lingered another half hour chatting by the fireside, then separated for the night. Florence Duncome-trod lightly, and closed the door gently behind her, as slhe entered the room which she and Lilian had shared ever since their Uncle and Aunt Lambert had opened their hearts and home to them-their newly-orphaned nieces. Eight years the -young girls had now lived there, loved and cherished with almost the same affection as, that bestowed so lavishly upon Meta, the only daughter of the house. Lilian was already in bed, and her soft regular breathing told her sister that she slept. 'Dear me, how can she sleep so! I'm sure I shall lie awake for hours, thinking of it all," murmured Florence, setting the light wherie it left the bed in shadow, and hastening her prepara. tions to take her place by Lilian's side. The next morning the sun shone brightly in a cloudless winter sky; but the" young revellers slept late,', and Lilian was the only one who made her appearance at the breakfast table. & She dame 'down looking fresh and sweet as a flower, in a neat morning wrapper, edged with tiny white ruffles at the neck and wrists. Her uncle welcomed. her with' a pleased smile, and a compliment on her bright looks and the becomingness of her dress, then asked for her sister and cousin. "They were up late last night, and we have let them lie a little longer/   than usual this- morning," remarked his wife, as she handed him his cup of coffee. "All right," he said; " let them take their rest, and have a good breakfast when they are ready for it. -But I hope I shall not often be deprived of the pleasure of seeing their bright faces at the table," Breakfast over, Lilian assisted her aunt with some household duties; then returned to her room, and sat down to her writing desk, to reply to a. letter received the day before. Florence had just risen, and was busied in arranging her hair before the dressing table, which stood between two windows that looked out upon the grounds in front of the house. "There, Lil!' she suddenly ex- claimed, "I told you so! Mr. Dana is coming in at the gate. Good! good! Now prepare yourself for a request for a private interview with Miss Dun- come, followed up by an offer of hand, heart, and fortune."' And she danced gleefully about the room, letting the comb slip from her fingers in her excitement, and dropping her hair pins over the floor. "What nonsense, Flo," answered her sister, quietly, scarce ceasing for an in- stant the motion of her pen. "It is nothing unusual for a gentleman to call the next day after being out in company with a lady; nothing more than common politeness for him to come and inquire how she is after her dissipation." "We shall see," said Florence, nod- -ding her head sagaciously,; as she gathered up anew, and wound about it the heavy, shining braids of hair she had let fall in her rapid movement. There was a ring at the door bell as she spoke, and a moment after a; colored servant girl appeared with a   card, which she handed to Lilian, saying, "The gentleman asked for you, miss." "Didn't he say the ladies, Lucinda?" "No, ma'am, he first inquired how the ladies was after their ride; and then he asked, could he see Miss Dun- come-Miss Lilian Duncome?" "Very well, tell him I will be there in a moment."   And as the door closed on Lucinda, Lilian rose Xvith a slight flush on her cheek, glanced at the mirror, to see that hair and dress were in perfect order, and was turning to leave the room when  Florence stopped her. Throwing an arm around her sister's waist: "Now, Lil," she said, with an arch smile, and in a low, coaxing tone, "do say Yes; there's a dear good girl. You don't know how I would like a chance to queen it in Chicago as the beautiful sister of the no less beautiful, fascinating, and  fashionable Mrs. Dana." "O Flo, how absurd!" And Lilian turned awy with a gesture of impa- tience, and hurrying from the' room, glided down the stairs, and the next moment was shaking hands' with Mr. Dana in the parlor. As she did so, a hasty glance about the apartment told her that they were alone. She perceived it with regret and annoyance; for, spite of her reso- lute refusal to believe her sister's pro- phecy, something in her visitor's man- ner set her heart to fluttering, and sent the rich blood mantling, for an instant, over cheek and brow. But calming herself by a determined effort of will, she sat down and began talking in a lively strain of the last night's entertainment and the home- ward ride., The gentleman seemed absent and somewhat ill at ease, answering only in   monosyllables, until at length his em- barrassment- communicated itself to her, and an awkward silence fell upon them both. She was vainly racking her brain for: some new topic .of discourse, when he suddenly turned to her, and taking her hand in his poured out such a tale of love and devotion as well nigh over- whelmed her withl surprise and con- fusion. He said he had not forgotten the disparity of their ages, but begged her to believe that advancing years, so far from cooling the ardor of youthful feeling, had with him but increased its intensity; so that though he had loved truly and well in his younger days, he now loved with much greater fervor, and if she could but return his affec- tion, even in some slight degree, if she would but give herself to him to be "his own, his darling, his wife "-she should be so tenderly cherished, so loved and cared for as never woman had been before. Lilian listened to this outpouring with mingled feelings, in which regret and dismay were uppermost; and for a moment after he paused for a reply, she seemed unable to utter a syllable. But at length shle stammered out an entreaty that he would give up all thoughts of her in that connection, and never mention the subject again. "I am so sorry, Mr. Dana, so very sorry that you have spoken thus to me," she said. "I have liked you so much as my father's friend and my own, and I shall always like, and re- spect, and admire you, and feel that you have done me a great honor this morning; and yet-and yet I know I can never look upon you in that light." He interrupted her. "Ah," he said, in a tone of deep mortification and re- gret, "' I see I have been too hasty, and     that I have :frightened you by my vehemence too; but I can wait-I can wait years if necessary; you are worth waiting for, Lilian"--and again he seized and passionately kissed the hand she had withdrawn fromn his grasp while speaking-" and I will teach you to love me. I can, I know I can, and I will, if you will only give me time, and'not crush my hopes'entirely." "O Mr. Dana, you pain mel" she murmured, turning away her face, now burning with blushes. "It is very painful to be compelled to treat with such seeming ingratitude one who has been so kind and faithful a friend to me and mine; and yet I know I can- not feel toward you as you wish. You would not want the hand without the heart, and- that it is not in my power to give." '"Has another already gained pos- session of it?" he asked, in a husky tone. "Pardon the question; I have no right to ask it, I know, but--O Lilian, sweetest, best, and dearest of women, how can I resign all hope of winning you? No, no, I cannot! But tell me that your heart and hand are still free." "They are," she said-and thought she spoke:truly; but even as the words left her lips, a pair of dark brown eyes seemed to look reproachfully into hers. She had seen them the evening be- fore for the first time, and yet, sleep- ing and waking, they had haunted her ever since. "But it would be wrong and cruel to deceive you," she continued. "Love will not be forced; it comes spontane- ously; iand much as I honor and re- spect. you, I could not give you a warmer affection than I might feel for my father or brother." "Give me but that " he cried,   hastily. " O Lilian, give me but that, and I will be content." Lilian .perceived with dismay that she had made a mistake, and given en- couragement where she meant to with- hold it entirely; 'but it was too late to retrieve her error, for at that instant the door opened and Mrs. Lambert came in, fresh from a walk, and quite unconscious that she was intruding upon a private interview. She seemed not to notice' the slight embarrassment her entrance caused in both her niece and the visitor, but seating herself, began talking of the weather and other commonplace topics. Then the door bell rang again, and Mrs. Beck, a gay young widow, who always smiled very sweetly upon the rich widower, came in, saluting all with her bland good morning;. upon which Mr. Dana beat a hastyretreat, holding Lilian's hand in a' fond, lin- gering pressure as he made his adieux. His eyes asked beseechingly for a word or glance of encouragement, but hers resolutely sought the floor, and he turned away,with a half-suppressed sigh. Mrs. Lambert was called out to at- tend to some domestic detail, and Lilian was compelled to sit for an hour listen- ing to praises of Mr. Dana and conjec- tures in regard to his intention of marrying again, and parrying ques- tions as to the relation in which she stood, or might yet stand to him. But it came to an end at last; the lady departed, and Lilian flew to her own room. She hoped to find it unoccupied; but both sister and cousin were there, impatiently awaiting her coming. They had received invitations to at- tend a party on the evening of the following day; and were both busied in the preparation of some new finery for   the occasion; yet by no means too much absorbed in their work for the indulgence of a large share of curiosity in regard to Lilian's love affairs. "Well?" exclaimed Florence, en- quiringly, as her sister entered. Lilian's only reply was 'a rather melancholy smile and shake of the lead, accompanied by a slight sigh, as she seated herself at her writing desk, and took up her pen to finish her letter. "Now, Lil, that's too bad!" cried AMeta, half eagerly, half laughingly. "Are you actually meaning to condemn us to the gnawings of unsatisfied curi- osity? Come, tell us all about it; do now, there's a dear, good girl!" "Do you think that would be quite fair to Mr. Dana-supposing there is anything to tell?" asked Lilian, bend- ing lower over her work, while a vivid blush suffused her cheek. "We are not lovers, or ever likely to be; and that, I think, is all I ought to tell you." "I suppose you're right, but it is very provoking," said Florence; " and you might just as well speak out about it, for I am perfectly certain he has offered, and that you've been silly enough to reject him-the best match in all this region of country; and I never was so vexed with you in all my life." "If I were to marry any one for his wealth and position, or for anything but the true, earnest love a woman  ought to feel for her husband, I think I should be a fool, indeed, Flo," an- swered Lilian, quietly. "I would have no right to expect a blessing on our union, or to look for happiness in it; it would be but a life of gilded misery, and sooner than accept such a life, I would toil like a slave for my own support."' "Well, I,- for one, have no fancy for   a life of toil," replied Florence, tossing her head disdainfully; "and I should think it a sin and a shame-a tempt-. ing of Providence, in fact--to throw. away such an offer." "Honest labor, of either hand or brain, is no disgrace," said Lilian. "The Bible bids us with quietness to work, and to eat our own bread." "I don't think that was meant to teach that young ladies are to start out in the world and make a living for themselves," said Florence; "and how you can be willing to undergo the drudgery of the school-room, when there's no necessity, I don't under- stand." "No. Wlly will you persist in that, Lilian," said Meta, "when you know father is quite able and willing to do everything for you, just as he does for Flo and me?" "Uncle is very, very kind," replied Lilian, turning toward her cousin with glistening eyes; "but I am not willing to be an idler, wasting the time, talents, and education God has given to be used in his service. I know he will require an account of them, and my labors in the schoolroom do not seem like drudgery to me, when I remember that in the faithful performance of them I am, pleasing him. Love light- ens labor wonderfully, and it is a blessed thing to be a ' follower of God as a dear child,"' she added, with a sweet and joyous smile. "Ah, Lilian, if I were but as good as you!" exclaimed Meta, with a slight sigh. "Good!" replied Lilian, in a low, half sad tone. "No, no, cousin, I am not that; or half so amiable by nature as you; and if there is any difference in my favor, it is. only that I have ac- cepted the offer--as freely made to you as to me--of a righteousness not my own."     "I never saw anything like the way Lil always manages to bring in reli- gion," exclaimed Florence, with an impatient shrug of her shoulders:; "begin where you will, she is sure to end there." "I am sorry if I have annoyed you, Flo. I will try to avoid a repetition of the offence in future," said Lilian, re- turning to her writing. The sisters had not many traits in common, though neither was faultless, and each had many good qualities. They were both very proud, each in 'her own way; but with Lilian it was 'the pride of independence, with Flor- ence the meaner, and perhaps more ordinary kind, that leads its possessor to look down upon the poor, and to re- gard labor, as a means of support, as iln itself degrading. The little property the two had- in- herited from their parents had been barely jsufficient to educate and to clothe them up to within a year or two; and Lilian, knowing such to be the case, had, immediately on leaving school, announced her intention to do something for her own support. In this she was violently opposed by her sister, and, in a more moderate way, by her aunt and uncle, who gener- ously offered to provide at their own expense all that was necessary for both their orphan nieces. Lilian expressed herself deeply grate- ful for this kind offer, and accepted it so far as to make her home with them; but opened a select school in the place, and was succeeding very well. Her aunt and uncle had soon become reconciled to her course; but Florence still continued to feel it a mortification that her sister was earning her own living. She was not indolent, or fond of a state of dependence; and but for the promptings of her foolish pride   would have been ready enough to fol-' low Lilian's example; but as it was, she contented herself with knitting and sewing for the members of her own family, and assisting her aunt in the lighter household duties. Of this Meta-who' was a spoiled child, and naturally of an easy, indlo- lent temperament-was very glad, as it relieved her from any feeling of obligation to take these cares and duties upon herself. CHAPTER II. R. DANA h ad taken a very strong fa/ncy to sweet Lilian' Duncome, was very much in love, and by no means to be utterly disheartened by one rejection of his suit. He went to tlhe young lady's uncle, told his tale, and earnestly begged the good man's influence in his favor. Mr. Lambert readily promised to exert it to the utmost; though not very sanguine of success; for he had long since discovered that his niece had a mind and will of her ownV; and that though always ready to listen with re- spect and deference to his opinions and arguments, shle was quite capable of afterward deciding for herself. He would have ,\been glad to see her accept Mr. Dana; as a marriage with him would at once give her wealth and high position; but he knew her well enough to feel certain that such con- siderations would have very little weight with her, and that the suitor's only chance of success would be in gaining her affections. And this he told him. "Well, do what you can for me, Mr. Lambert," was the reply. "I will not , hurry her into matrimony, if she ob- jects-I'm willing to wait, if it must   be so-but try, my dear sir to gain me an immediate acceptance; and if even that cannot be had, persuade her to give me time to win her heart, to teach her to love me. I'm sure -I can do it, if only she will give me a little flope. ' And tell your wife, Lambert, how matters stand between us; and ask her good offices for me." "I will, and I have no doubt she will be favorable to your suit; that is, if Lilian can give you her heart with her hand."            \ Lilian noticed a peculiar and some- what quizzical expression on her uncle's face as they met and exchanged glances at the dinner table, and gu'essing at the cause, she was not surprised when, at the conclusion of the meal, he asked for a little private. conversation with her. She silently acquiesced, and he led the, way to the library; a room but lit- tle frequented by any of the family ex- cept themselves. "I think we will not be likely to be interrupted here," he said, motioning lier to be seated in a large arm-chair 'by the fireside, while he took possession of its opposite neighbor. "I want to have a little chat with you; I presume you will be at no loss to conjecture on what subject. "Really, Lilian, this offer of Mr. Dana's is an excellent one for you; and I would be very glad if you could make up your mind to accept it. It seems to me lie is all a woman could reasonably ask--fine-looking, well edu- cated, intelligent, honorable in his business transactions, and therefore highly respected; of unblemished moral character, and nmore than that, I believe sincerely pious. He is of excellent family, too, and very wealthy. Indeed, I can't see any possible objection, ex- cept his age; and that is, after all, a   mere trifle when weighed against all. that can be urged in his favor. Why, he is only forty-five, and if he keeps his hlealth, will probably be an active business man for thirty years to come." He paused, as if for a reply; but Lilian made none. She was sitting with her cheek upon her hand, her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the car- pet. "I would not decide too hastily, Lilian," Mr. Lambert went on; "I would take time to consider the matter carefully, and see if I could not make up my mind to accept so eligible an offer." . "A month's, or a year's considera- tion of it could make' no difference in my feelings, and therefore none in my decision, uncle," she said, quietly, giv- ing him a calm, earnest look out of her large, expressive eyes. "I acknow- ledge the truth of all you have been saying; but-I do not love the man; and I feel certain that I never can." "And why? what have you to urge against him?" he asked. "Nothing, uncle; nothing whatever. I greatly respect and honor liim, like him very much as a firienld, but could never take him for anything nearer or dearer," she answered, firmly. "I can- not explain it; but we do not love by rule, and love will not be forced." "Well," he said, rising to go, "I have given you the best advice in my power, and you must do as you please about accepting, it; I cannot force you to take Mr. Dana, and would not if I could; but really, my dear child, I think you are a little bit silly, and per- haps I might add a trifle obstinate, too." But his tone was kinder than his words, and he drew her towards him, as he spoke, stroked her hair and kissed her cheek, for she too had risen and     was standing by his side;, then bidding her a hasty good-by, he hurried a'way to his place of business. The Christmas holidays had begun, and Lilian's time was at her own dis- posal. . Left thus alone, she sunk back among the cushions of the easy chair, and shading her eyes with her hand, thought long and deeply; going over all her uncle had said, and asking her- self, "Am I acting wisely and well? am I doing right?" But the longer she considered these questions, the more satisfied she felt that she was taking the only proper course. Her reverie was at length broken in upon by her aunt, who came softly into the room and seated herself by her side. "I believe I can guess the subject of your thoughts, my dear," she said, taking Liliat's hand affectionately in llers. "Your uncle has told me of Mr. Dana's offer; and I need not tell you lhow pleased we would all be, if you could like him well enough to accept it. It is a match that almost any girl might covet, Lilian. I think you may consider yourself really honored by his preference." "I do. But, aunt, he is old enough to be my father." "Well, what: matter if he is, my child? Think of his wealth and high standing in society; and remember that a young man could not offer you- the same advantages; he would have his wcay still to make in the world, and you would have to share his struggles, his cares and toils." "' That would be only a pleasure, if I loved him!" exclaimed Lilian. "But Mr,. Dana I do not love, and never can;' "nd I cannot marry houses and lands, money-bags, or bank-stock. I'm sure, aunt, you are too good and right- minded to counsel me to that." \   "I hope so, indeed, my dear; but don't you think now, you could learn to like him for himself, if you would only try?" "Like him? Yes, I do that already. I like him very much as a friend; but the man I marry must be more to me than all the world beside; and that I know Mr. Dana can never be." "Ah, I see it is quite useless," said Mrs. Lambert, smiling; "'a wilful woman will have her way.'" "Yes, aunt; and I hope you and my uncle-fully convinced of that fact- will waste no more of your valuable breath in combating my resolution," answered Lilian, returning the smile. They separated, and Lilian returned to her own room, hoping she was now done with arguments in favor of Mr. Dana's suit, and entreaties to accept it. But not so; Florence had set her heart on the match, and now quite cer- tain the offer had been made, she used all the eloquence she was mistress of, to persuade her sister to give her hand to the wealthy widower; and even grew quite angry and indignant when she .found her efforts vain, accused Lilian of having encouraged  Mr. Dana's attentions, and said that she thought her in honor bound to accept him. "I do not think so, Florence. I never meant to give him any undue encour- agement; never looked upon him in the light of a lover, or thought of his attentions as meaning anything but the kind feeling he would naturally entertain for the daughter of an old friend." "Nonsense!" exclaimed Florence, angrily; "any body could see with half an eye what he was after; and you are acting shamefully in rejecting him now. But I see you have no re- gard for either his feelings or my inter, \   ests. How much more to my advan- tage it would be, to have a sister at the head of society in' Chicago, than one teaching a village school here in Chil- ford? I think if you had any real love for me, that consideration would turn the scale in Mr. Dana's favor. But I cannot expect it, of course; for you are always too selfish to consider any one's interests but your own." \ Lilian was deeply wounded by this unkind reproach, which she felt to be wholly undeserved; for she had ever been a kind, affectionate sister, often giving up her own wishes to please Florence. "I don't think I have deserved this of you, Flo," she said, half angrily, half Bsadly. "I love you very much; but I cailnot consent to sacrifice- the happi- ness of my whole life for what might, after all, prove of no real advantage to you." "No, it would be a shame," said Meta, who was present. "You are ask- ing entirely too much of her, Flo; and as for Mr. Dana, there's no danger of his heart breaking; it must be quite too old and tough by this time." The tea bell put an end to the con- versation. , It was rather later than their usual hour; and as they rose from the table the servant girl announced that two young gentlemen were in the. parlor, waiting to, see the young ladies. They proved to be Harry Griswold, an admirer of Florence, and Aubrey Falconer, the young lawyer, of whom she had spoken so scornfully the even- ing before. She received him now with an air of hauglity disdain, which brought the hot blood. to his cheek, but rendered all the more agreeable Meta's cordial hospitality, and the grave, yet sweet and gentle dignity of Lilian's manner. He had loved Lilian at first sight,   and every moment spent in her society but increased his passion, while she was almost equally pleased with him. He drew a chair near the sofa on which she seated herself, and they presently fell into earnest conversation. Mr. Falconer had no talent for the small talk which some men seem to think is all a woman can understand, but possessed a cultivated mind and a good deal of general inforfimation, and could converse sensibly and well on all the ordinary topics of the day, and also on many subjectsl more closely connected with literature and the arts and sciences. He, however, made no parade of his acquirementsi but was remarkably modest and unassuming. He and Lilian were soon left to them- selves, the other three forming a little group on the opposite side of the room, and being so taken up with their own lively chit-chat as to ,pay no attention to them. But it was not long before this pleas- ant state of things was interrupted by the opening of the door, followed by the entrance of Mr. Dana. Bowing formally to the company, he regarded Aubrey with a slight scowl of mingled surprise and dislike; while Lilian rose to greet him and offer a seat, showing no sign of embarrassment save a slightly lieightened color. She was not glad to see him. She had hoped he had left the town, and that she should escape farther atteni- tion from him; and she felt thankful to Meta for coming instantly forward, taking possession of him, and keeping him at her side until the others rose to take leave. The moment they were gone, Lilian made her escape to her own room, where she remained for the rest of the evening. Mr. Dana went away at last, evi-     dently much chagrined. But he was slow to give up hope, and continued to persecute Lilian with his attentions, which she constantly declined when- ever it could be done without positive rudeness. He haunted the house, but she kept out of his way as much as possible. For some months previous to the opening of our story, Harry Griswold hiad paid rather marked attentions to Florence Duncome, and up to the time of Lilian's rejection of Mr. Dana's suit they had been very favorably received; but from that day her manner became colder and more distant, and his invita- tions to ride or walk, or to accompany him to the lectures and concerts occa- sionally given in the village, were not unfrequently declined; while at the same time she seized every opportunity to make herself agreeable to Mr. Dana; dressing to suit his taste, so far as she was acquainted with it, condoling with him on Lilian's cruelty, and exerting every talent to the utmost for his en- tertainment. Finding it useless to try to persuade Lilian to take him, she had determined to secure him -or rather his wealth and position-herself, if possible. She did not love Mar. Dana, and she knew she never could; .but she did love wealth and its attendant luxury and ease, and the importance it would give her in the eyes of the-world at- large; and although Harry Griswold had pos- sessed himself of what heart she had to give, she was firm in her secret re- solve that- the hand should, not follow while there was the slightest hope of one day becoming the mistress of the fine city residence, and elegant country- seat of,the elder gentleman. Mr. Griswold, it is true, was a rising young   lawyer, had  already made money enough to buy a good lot in   31 the town and begin building a neat cottage, and seemed likely soon to be able to support a wife very comfort- ably; but compared with the city beau, he was quite a poor man; and Flor- ence did not feel at all certain that Mrs. Griswold might not sometimes have to do at least a part of her own work. So Mrs. Griswold she would not be- come, if she might be Mrs. Dana; yet she would not cast Harry off entirely, lest she should lose both chances. And Lilian's rejected lover gradually fell into the snare so skilfully laid for him. Thle sympathy of Florence was soothing to his heart wounds, and her strong appreciation of the high honor le, ihad dlone her sister by the offer of his hand, healed those inflicted upon his pride. Then, he began to notice that she was more regularly and bril- liantly beautiful than Lilian, more hglily accomplished, and a more lively and entertaining companion. It was, however, many months ere this change in llis feelings had been fully wrought, and his affections quite transferred from the elder to the younger sister; and in the meanwhile love had' waged many a hard-fouglht battle with worldly pride. and ambition ill theiheart of Florellce. Lilian, watching her sister with the keen eye of tffection, guessed the truth, and tried, but vainly, to influence her to better things. She indignantly de- nied- that she cared for Harry, or had ever given him reason to think so, or that she was seeking to attract Mr. Dana. She was only, she asserted, try- ing to make him some little amends for all Lilian's unkind treatment. Lilian was the more sad for her sis- ter; because love-a deep, true, pure affection for a worthy object-love. given and returned, was making her   own life so bright and beautiful. She and Aubrey Falconer had seen much of each other in the evenings at her uncle's, where he was always made a welcome guest, in an occasional morn- ing or afternoon ramble, and at the so- cial gatherings of the young people of both sexes; and, though no vows had been exchanged, no word of love spo- ken, eyes had told to eyes the tale in language not to be misunderstood. Often had the words trembled on Aubrey's tongue, but an extremely modest estimate of his own merits, joined to the remembrance of his pov- erty, -kept him silent. And Lilian had not questioned her own heart; she only knew that his so- ciety was more agreeable to Iher than that of any other person; but did not trouble herself to consider why it was so. They were entirely congenial, and their slight differences of opinion only served to enliven their conversation, and thus give greater zest to the plea- sure -of their intercourse. Somewhat'reserved with most people, particularly in regard to such things as concerned himself personally, with Lilian, Aubrey was very frank and open; and thus she gradually learned much of his past history and of his fu- ture ptans and prospects. Like herself, he had been orphaned at a tender age, and had no near rela- tive but a sister, of whom and her two little children he spoke with a warmth of affection that increased Lilian's esti- mate of hIis nobleness of character and kindness of heart. Tlere was always a tone of sadness in his mention of his sister, as if she had known some great sorrow, some- thing far harder to endure than even poverty; and Ni-hen Lilian asked one day if this sister was a widow: "No, no, indeed! better for her, ten   thousand times better, if she were!" he exclaimed, with sudden and almost passionate vehemence. Lilian gave him a quiet glance of surprise, and he turned his head away and nmoved on in silence for a moment. It was a beautiful afternoon early in June, and they were searching the woods together for flowers, he having joined her as she left the school-room. He stooped to pluck a wild rose, and presenting it to her said, "I have sur- prised and shocked you by my outhurst of temper. ' Nay, do not try to excuse me. I should not hlave spoken as I did; but having done so, I must ex- plain. "My sister married early in life a man much older than herself; a mem- ber of thie churchll, and one who makes very loud professions too. If piety consists in the wearing of a solemn vis- age, giving a strict attention to the out- ward forms and ceremonies of religion, using a set of cant phrases about the depravity of humnan nature, etc., etc., and the making of long, tedious pray- ers, too dull and lifeless to be listelned to with patience, all this joined to a high estimnate of one's self, and a pro- portionably low one of others, then is my brother-in-law a very pious mall." "No, ah  no, Mr. Falconer," saidl Lilian, earnestly, as lie paused as if expecting a reply; "tliat is by no means a true description of the religion of Christ. A real Christian will bear more or less of the image of hls Master, who was mneek and lowly in heart, and full of tenderness and compassion to- ward others." "I believe you are-right; but to re- turn to my brother-in-law. His reli- gion answers to my description, not yours; and, to complete the picture, he is hard and close in his dealings, exact- ing the uttermost farthing, and giving     very grudgingly, even -to such objects as lie acknowledges to have the strong- est claim upon the benevolence of Christians. I have known him to get up in a church meeting, when 'the col- lection-box was about to be passed around, and exhort the brethren to give liberally, for the cause was a good one, then turn around and put in a penny himself. He keeps a country store, which brings him in a very tolerable income, and he owns, beside, one of the finest farms in that section; but he will not allow his wife to have any help, with either housework or sewing, except for a few weeks during harvest. He exacts a strict account of every penny he gives her, and they are so fewthat she is actually compelled to find ways of earning the greater part of her own and the children's clothing. She is just working herself to death. Bu't worse than that, he is so sour-tem- pered and so unsympathizitg, as well as so close-fisted, that he is fast crush- ing out all her spirit; and she has such a hopeless, weary look that it makes my heart ache to think of it." Lilian echoed the deep sigh with which he concluded.   , "Poor thing; hers is a- sad lot; but I am glad she has an affectionate bro- ther. . And her dear little children, they must be a source of comfort, too. And I hope," she added, softly, "she does not bear her burdens alone ; but knows the blessedness of being able to take them all to one wlio is both able and willing to bear them for her." "No; she is not a Christian, nor aml I. Does it strike you as strange, Miss Duncome, that 'this man has been a stumbling-block to us both? That we have said to ourselves, 'If this be Chris- : tianity, I wanit none of it?"' '"Alas, no! for such is the way of the world; ever to judge of the religion of           .   Jesus, not by the pure and holy life of its founder, but by the failings of his professed followers. Yet are they not most unwise and unreasonable in so doing? What, Mr. Falconer, would you think of the man who should pro- nounce worthless all the coin of the realm, and refuse to- accept it, because, forsooth, he had occasionally met with a spurious imitation? Would it not be the hleigllt of folly so to do? Does not the very fact that a thing is coun- terfeited prove it to be of value? Do men take the trouble to counterfeit that which is in itself worthless?" "No, they do not; that is quite true," he said, thoughtfully. "Your reasoning is sound; and I fear I have been foolish in allowing myself to be so influenced by the example of one false professor. I will think of what you have been saying," he added, bow- ing his adieu; for they had reached her uncle's gate. "Do; for it is a subject of'infinite importance to us all; and only the present moment can any of us call his own," she answered, earnestly. He bowed a silent assent, and turned away, just as Meta's voice summoned Lilian to come and admire some plants she had been setting out in the garden. Florence was with her cousin. "Where have you and 5Mr. Falconer been now?" she asked, with a touch of ill humor in her voice. "It seems to me you are together rather often." "We have been botanizing; we are both fond of the study," replied her sister, showing her floral treasures. "Really, Lilian, you ought not to. give him  so much encouragement," said Florence; scarcely deigning a glance at the flowers ip her sister's hand. "He is not your equal, and though no sensible person could sup- pose you intend to marry him, he may   be foolish enough to build false hopes on your seeming pleasure in his society." "Seeming!" said Lilian, flushing. "There is no seeming about it; I do take pleasure in his society; for he converses sensibly and well, and is always polite and agreeable in his manners. "And as to his not being my equal, Florence, I should like to know why lie is not. In talent and education he is my superior; in good looks also, I think; his manners 'are as good as mine, and if he is not rich neither ami I." "Then you do intend to marry him?" "He has not asked me, and I do not think it necessary to consider the ques- tion until he does." "Tllere, I knew  it!" exclaimed Florence, angrily. "I see just how it will be; you were foolish enough to re- ject the rich and highly respected Mr. Dana, and you will take this man whom nobody cares a pin for, and who is as poor as a church mouse." "O Florence, why will you talk so!" said Lilian, wearily. "I tell you I do not want to consider the subject at all. But why will you make wealth of sh much importance?  Do not ' riches certainly take to themselves wings and fly away?'" CHAPTER   III. MDUSINESS called Mr. Falconer out of town a day or two later in the week, and kept him away for nearly a fortnight. When he returned the weather had become extremely warm. He and Lilian passed each other in the street as she was on her way to the school-room, but had time for only a hasty good-morning. 2   As she entered her uncle's door in the afternoon of that day Meta met her with a pale, excited face. "O Lilian!" she exclaimed. "Is it not dreadful? But how unconcerned you look! Then you do not care for him after all; but, perhaps, you have not heard." "Heard what?" asked Lilian, hurri- edly, while her cheek blanched, anid her heart beat almost to suffocation, and she caught at the balustrade for support; for it was in the lower hall she had met her cousin. "Why, about poor Mr. Falconer; but don't look so frightened, or I shall not tell you another word." "You must! you must! O Meta, how you torture me,!" she gasped, clutching her cousin's arm, and look- ing wildly into her face. "I would not for the world," said Meta, in a sweetly compassionate tone. "And I am ashamed of myself for alarming you so. It is only that Mr. Falconer has been suddenly taken ill. He was coming from the river, where he had been bathing, and fell in the street and had to be carried home." Lilian looked beseechingly into her cousin's face, as if she would ask for further particulars; but Meta shook her head sorrowfully. "That is all we have heard," she said. Lilian moved as if about to ascend the stairs, then sank down upon the lowest step, trembling violently. Meta sat down beside her, and passed her arm about her waist. "It may be nothing dangerous," she whispered, soothingly. "I would not worry; do, dear Lil, try to be calm." "I will, I will," answered Lilian, in an almost inaudible tone; "but it was so sudden, so unexpected." She was silent for some moments,     and seemed to be struggling hard to conquer her emotion. "There, lean your poor head on my shoulder," said Meta, drawing it down to that resting place. "I shall never forgive myself for being so cruelly ab- rupt. I might have- known better; I might have guessed how it would affect you."  - "Meta, Meta," whispered Lilian, "do not betray me. For the honor of our sex keep my secret. We are not betrothed; he has never spoken of love; and I have no right to show more feeling for him than mere friend- ship would warrant." "I know, I understand, and not a word of this will I breathe to living soul. But to me, dear, you can 'tell your sorrows and anxieties.- And- there is a dearer Friend whose sympa- thy anid love will help you to bear your load," she added, half-hesitatingly. "Thank you, dear, that is comfort,'" said Lilian, returning the soft, loving pressure of Meta's hand. ' "And now I think I can go to myroom." "Come to mine," said MAeta, as they rose, while she still supported her cousin with her arm. "You will wish to be alone for a while, and you can be there; but Florence is in yours." Lilian gladly accepted the kind offer, feeling yet quite unequal to meeting her sister's searching glance. Meta led hereto the door, then left her to the comforts of solitude and prayer, while she went to her cousin's room, where Florence sat sewing. She looked up as Meta entered: "I wish Lilian would come," she said. "How do you think she will feel about this news? .do you suppose she really cares for him, and will take it much to heart?"    ^ "Really," said Meta, turning away her face, " how should I know? I   don't believe they're engaged; but yet I've a notion they are fond of each other." "And do you suppose 'she will be crazy enough to marry him if he's going to be subject to fits?" "I don't know, I hope he wont be; we don't know that this was a fit, Flo." "Well, I'd rather he'd die, than live and be my brother-in-law, if he's going to be fitty.", "O Florence, I am sure he is to be pitied-to be taken so ill here among strangers!" exclaimed Meta, in a tone of mingled sorrow and indignation. "Of course; and I am sorry for him; but I know he was courting Lil, and I hope this will stop it." "I can't see why you should dislike Mr. Falconer so, or object as you do to a match between him and Lilian, if they like one another."' "Because he's poor, and nobody knows anything about his family." "I've heard enough to be sure that his family is respectable; and as to his poverty, tlat's not likely to last if he keeps his health. Father says he has both talent and energy, and that with these qualities a young man is sure to rise in our country; and very likely to gain both wealth and honors." Florence made no reply, other than a slight toss of her head, and Meta taking up a book, they sat in silence for the next half hour, when Lilian joined them, looking much as usual. In that half hour of solitude and silent communion with her unseen Friend, she had grown calm and strong to meet and endure whatever might be before her. Florence was still in doubt whether Lilian had not heard, or did not care for the news of Mr. Falconer's illness; r and she was hesitating as to the pro- [ priety of speaking to her on the subject,   when Meta, who was looking from the window, rose quickly, and taking Lilian's hand, said, in a low, pitiful tone: "Harry Griswold is coming, and now we shall hear all the particulars; for he was with poor Aubrey when he was taken ill. Will you go down and see him?" Lilian put her hand to her heart for an instant, as if to still its wild throb- bing, then said low and faintly, "No, ,you go, please, and I will wait here." There was a quick, loud ring at the door bell, and Meta ran out to tlhe head of the stairs to hear who was in- quired for. Florence too had caught a glimpse of the visitor as he came in at the gate, and was now before the mirror, giving a few little finishing touches to her dress; for though ready to cast him overboard to secure a wealthier match, she still thought Harry Griswold's ad- miration worth winning; and occupied with her own appearance, she had not heard what passed between her sister and cousin. Harry's voice was heard asking for the ladies, and Meta ran down, Flor- ence following, while Lilian closed the door after them, and sank into a low chair by the bedside, hiding her face in the pillows; but only for a moment, for a murmur of voices coming to her from the room below, she raised it -again and strained her ear to catcli the words. But she could distinguish nothing beyond the tones of inquiry and reply, and she waited in almost feverish im- patience for her cousin's return. At length a light footstep sounded on the stairs and in the hall without, then the door opened softly, and Meta stole in, and kneeling before her cousin, passed an arm about her waist. "It is not so bad as it might be,   "ilian, dear," she said, in low, soothing tones, for Lilian had grown very pale and trembled visibly. "They have had nearly every doctor in town there, and they all say it is a very singular case, and that they cannot understand it, but that he is in no immediate danger, and they hope may ultimately recover." "Thank God!." murmured Lilian, while a tear rolled silently down her cheek. " O Meta, I feared he might be dead or dying, and that he was not ready to go. But tell me, is he suffer- ing much?" "No; not at all intensely, Harry says;, and he is perfectly sensible. His head does not seem to be affected in the least, but he is quite helpless; almost entirely paralyzed." "Paralyzed!" exclaimed Lilian, in a startled tone.       . "Yes. But don't be too much dis- tressed; they hope, he will get over it in time." Lilian leaned her head back against the wall, and closed her eyes with a groan. "Oh, it is terrible!"   she moaned. "Yes, if he were not going to get over it; but you see they think he is," said Meta, cheerfully. "I suppose that may probably de- pend in a great measure upon the ex- citing cause," said Lilian; "do they know or suspect what that is?" "They don't know; he was much heated by exercise and the weather, too, of course, and plunged into the river for a bath without waiting to cool off gradually; and he felt this stroke immediately after coming out of the water." "Ah, Meta, if I  might but go to him; if I had but the right to be his nurse and comforter now in his terrible affliction!" murmured Lilian, clasping     her hands over her eyes, and turning away her face to hide the tears that were slowly trickling down her cheeks. "I wish you had, for I know I should wait :to if I were in your place. But don't fret. I'm sure he will be well taken care of; the neighbors are always so kind to any one who is sick or in trouble." This was very 'true, as Lilian was aware, and it was a great relief to her anxiety; for nowhere are to be found kinder or more sympathizing hearts, or hands more ready to give help to those upon whom any calamity has fallen, than in our western towns and villages. The tea bell rang, and Lilian hastily removed the traces of her agitation and went down with her .cousin to the di- ning-room, where they found the other members of the family, and also Mr. Griswold, who had been invited by Mrs. Lambert to. stay and take his supper with them. Lilian met the battery of eyes bravely, and no one would have sus- pected from her manner or appearance that she felt more than the interest of anl ordinary friend in the,sad and pain- ful affliction that had overtaken Mr. Falconer, and which was the principal theme of conversation at the table, as was probably the case in every house in the vicinity; for the strange and sad occurrence had caused a great excite- ment over the whole town, and awa- !eaned much commiseration for the poor sufferer. "What relatives has the poor young fellow?" asked Mr. Lambert, address- ing his guest. "I suppose you know, as I understand you and he are quite intimate." "Very few; none, I fear, who will be able to render him any assistance."   "Do you know his circumstances? I fear he has little or nothing." "Yes, poor fellow, I doubt if he has five dollars ahead." "'Then we must help him!" cried Mr. Lambert, with energy and decision. "He must have money enough to pay. his board, his doctor's bill, too, and to hire a nurse. Let us start a subscription- paper at once while everybody is .feel- ing so much for him. There is nothing like striking while the iron is hot. I'll head the list with fifty dollars. I am sorry that much at least; how sorry are you, Griswold?" "I'll put down twenty-five now, and may be able to do more after a while," replied the young lawyer; " and I will carry the paper around." "Come, then, let us to work at once," said his, host, rising and Heading the way to the library. "And we women," said Mrs. Lam- bert, as the gentlemen disappeared, "( must do our part by seeing that -the poor young fellow is well taken care of, and provided with whatever he can eat in the way of jellies and other little delicacies. I shall go over myself to- morrow and see what he needs." Lilian now stole quietly from the room, passing out into the garden. Meta had been pitying her all the time from the very bottom of her heart; but was glad to see, as she glanced fur- tively at her now and then, that, though very pale, she was able to preserve a calm exterior through it all. "He and Lilian have been a good deal together of late," said Mrs. Lam-' bert, looking after the young girl as she disappeared among the shrubbery. "I wonder if they are attached, I hope not for her sake; but i-f she cares par- ticularly for him, it must have been hard for her to sit here and listen to all that has been said."   "I hope she doesn't care for hm," said Florence. A beggar was a thing almost un- known in Chilford; and there was scarcely one of the inhabitants poor enough to ask help of his neighbors, unless in case of some sudden loss by flood or fire;, almost every one had something to spare, and being a gener- ous people, and just now full of strong sympathy for this unfortunate young stranger, many gave very liberally in proportion to their means; and thus enough was raised. o place him above want for several. months. And this' was made known to him by his friend Griiswold in the most kind and delicate manner. Tears glistened in' the eyes of the poor sufferer as he listened; his lip quivered,and it was some moments ere he was able to reply. "O Griswold, if I could only grasp your hand," he said at length; "but, alas! I am helpless as a log of wood. But how kind you and all of them have been. It is humbling to my pride to have to receive help; yet this has been given in the most delicate and -feeling manner. I entrust to you, my dear friend, the task of returning to all the donors my most sincere and hearty thanks." "I'll do it with pleasure. And now you need have no anxiety; you have nothing to do lAt rest and get well as fast as you can." "'As fast as I can!" repeated Aubrey, with a heavy sigh, "Yes, but how soon will that be? They tell me par- alysis is always a slow thing-quick to come, but slow to leave; and I suppose I may as well make up my mind to lie here for weeks, or perhaps for months. O Griswold, it's a horrible thing-this utter inability to move hand or foot."  For to that helpless:state was he now   reduced, the paralysis having increased to that degree that he was no longer able to move anything but his head. "It must be, indeed, and you have my heartfelt sympathy," said his friend. "And now, is there anything I can do for you? any writing of letters, for in- stance? I suppose you may have business correspondents who cannot wait for your recovery; or friends whom you would like to apprize of your condition." Falconer replied that there were several business letters he would be very glad to have answered at his dic- tation, and also one to his sister. "I do not want her to know my actual condition," he said; "it would alarm and trouble her too much; for she loves me dearly-my poor Adah! But she will be looking for a letter from me about this time, and I must let her know that something is wrong, or she'll be imagining all sorts of possi- ble evils; perhaps, even," he added, with a faint laugh, " that I may have 'shuffled off this mortal coil.'" Harry had already taken out the writing materials, and was now, seated, pen in hand, waiting for his friend's dictation. The business letters were dispatched first; then one to the sister, written in a cheerful, almost lively strain, not likely to awaken in her mind any seri- ous apprehensions on her brother's ac- count. He, drew a bright picture of social enjoyments and business prospects; and to account for the chirography of the, epistle being other than his own, said that an accident had deprived him, temporarily of the use of his right hand, but he hoped to recover it ere long. "This seems deceitful," he said, as Griswold, haying read the letter over     to him, proceeded to fold, seal, and direct it. "Butwhy should I add to her burden by telling her my true con- dition, when a few weeks may make me all right again?" "I dare say you are acting for the best," said Harry. "And now I'll go and post these for you. I'll be in whenever I can. Keep up a stout heart, and don't worry about business or anything else." He hurried from the room, and with a weary, hopeless sigh the invalid closed his eyes, and turned his-head to escape the painful flood of light pour- ing in through the wide open window, which his friend had forgotten to close. Alas, he could not rise to shut it,' or even so much as raise his hand to shade his aching orbs. But the door opened softly, a quiet step crossed the room; the shutters were drawn together, 'and the blind lowered far enough to exclude the un- pleasant glare, and yet admit the breeze which was, coming in laden with the perfume of flowers from a neighboring garden. "How are you to-day, my poor young friend?" asked a pitying voice; and Aubrey looked up to see a ma- tronly figure standing beside his couch, and a kind motherly face bending over him. He recognized Mrs. Lambert, and a faint, half-sorrowful smile trembled on his lips, as he answered: "Thank you, not in great pain, but a close prisoner, as you see, bound hand and foot, and chafing sorely under it. I cannot shake hands with you, nor could I do anything to escape the really painful glare of light from whiih: your kindness has relieved me." "It must be a terrible trial, but we will hope it may not be long con- tinued."   She then inquired most kindly con- cerning his wants, and whether they were attended to as they should be. "Thank you, I believe I have all I need; my meals are brought me regu- larly, and one or another of the family comes up to feed me; for I have be- come dependent even to that degree," he :said, with a sad resignation in his tone that touched Mrs. Lambert's kind heart, and filled her eyes with tears. "Ah, poor boy," she thought, "bhow much he needs sympathy and love; how much he wants a mother or sister. Well, I'll do what I can to supply their place. ' But you need something more than the supply of your physical wants," she said, in a cheerful tone; "some- thing to occupy your thoughts, and keep you from brooding over your troubles. I have an hour to spare, and have brought a book to read to you, if you like. Shall I do so?" HHe assented with politely worded thanks, but a tone that seemed to say he had no hope of being interested. But she wlas not to be discouraged, and seat- ing herself by his side, she began at once. Knowing Mrs. Lambert to be a pious woman, he had expected a sermon; but it proved to be a volume of poems that she had selected; and as she had a pleasant voice, and read remarkably well, he soon found himself listening with interest, and almost forgetting for the moment the sore trouble that was upon him. And when at length she Closed the book, saying that she had already overstayed her time, he thanked her warmly, and begged that she would coine again. She promised to do so as often as her domestic cares and duties would allow, and- with a kind good-bye, she left him to his own thoughts. These were sad and troubled enough,   going back at once to himself and his now gloomy prospects. He liad just got a fair start in his profession, and had several cases coming on at the next court; from the suc- cessful management of which he had hoped to gain both money and' fame; but there seemed but little hope that he would be able to attend. to them. He ought to be busy now collecting evidence and examining points of law; and, oh, how hard it was to be com- pelled to lie there inactive. And besides there was a lurking fear-a fear which he would not ac- knowledge even to his own heart- that it might be always thus with him. Restlessly he tossed his head from side to side, groaning with impatience, and heaving deep, long-drawn sighs at the thought of the future that might be before him. And thus he lay day after day, until the days lengthened into weeks, and the weeks into months; and still there was no change. The sympathy of the community was deep and heartfelt; the neighbors were very kind and attentive; and none more so than Harry Griswold and Mr. and Mrs. Lambert. Mrs. Lambert had raised a subscrip- tion among the ladies of the town, to buy him an easy chair, and in this he now passed his days, being lifted into it every morning, and back on to- the bed at .night. He had no regular nurse; such be- ing scarce in the place, and his means hardly admitting of the employment of one; but it was so arranged that he was never left entirely alone for more than a few minutes at a time; either a neighbor, or one- of the family with whom he boarded, being nearly always within call. Mrs. Lambert's visits were almost *   daily, and her kind efforts to soothe and entertain the sufferer were duly appre- ciated by him. They had helped more than anything else, to relieve the tedium of his long confinement, and cheer his drooping spirits. And where was Lilian during all these'tedious weeks? Going faithfully and patiently through her daily round of duties at home and at school; offer- ing up hourly prayers for him she loved, sending kind messages and little gifts through her aunt-but only such as friendship might prompt-and hid- ing her secret from all but Meta. And Aubrey?    He looked and longed for her coming, and grew sick at heart with hungering for a sight of her sweet face, the touch of her hand, the sound of her voice; asked after her welfare, but sent no word of invitation or entreaty that she would come to him; for if he had felt himself un- worthy of her before--when in all the strength and pride of his manhood-- what was he now, shorn of that strength, and reduced to so pitiable a state of utter helplessness? CHAPTER IV. IT was a delicious October morning; a golden haze filled the atmosphere, a purple mist half veiled the distant hills; the river sparkled in the sun- light, and the forests were gorgeous in their autumn robes. Aubrey Falconer sat by the window of his little room, and looked out upon all this loveliness with a sinking heart. Nearly four months had already rolled their weary round since- disease had laid her heavy hand upon him; and day by day hope had grown fainter in his breast, till now her light had well nigh expired.     A familiar step sounded in the pas- sage without; the door opened, and the kindly voice of his physician greeted him. "Good morning, Falconer; how do you find yourself to-day?" "Just the same useless log I have been for what seems an eternity of misery," groaned the poor cripple. "O  doctor, is there no help-no hope? nothing farther that your art call do?" "Time, my dear sir, time is the great remedy ini cases of paralysis," replied the physician, drawing up a chair and taking a seat by the side of the invalid. "You must have patience and not allow yourself to become discouraged; time may yet do wonders for you." "Patience 1" repeated the sufferer, wearily; " yes, it is very easy to talk of, but very difficult to practise. This utter helplessness is worse than pain." "Perhaps it is, I can realize that it must be terrible indeed; and yet pain might be superradded; it often is an element of distress in these cases. The brain is often affected too; for paralysis is sometimes caused by apoplexy; but your intellect is clear. So, my poor friend, are there not some mercy drops mingled in your cup, bitter though it be?" "It may seem so to you," replied Aubrey, turning away his face--"i dare say it does; for it is wonderfully easy for some people to bear other peo- ple's troubles-but as for me, I can see nothing at present but the dark side of the picture; and very dark it is." Dr. Brick was a kind-hearted man, as is, I think, ordinarily the case with men of his profession, and deeply com- miserating the, sad case of tlis poor patient, came in as often, and sat as long as he could in Justice to others who needed his help; and knowing   Aubrey's poverty, he made no charge for his services. Aubrey had borne up bravely thus far, and as the doctor went on talking, 'he made a great effort to rally. his spirits, and at length succeeded so far as to be able to reply in a cheerful strain. But an expression of deep gloom again settled down upon his counte- nance as the door closed upon his visi- tor, and he was left as before to the companionship of his own sad thoughts. As the doctor crossed the threshold he met Mrs. Lambert coming in. They exchanged greetings, and then the lady inquired, "How do you find our poor young friend this morning, doc- tor?" "Just as usual," he said, with a slight sigh. "It seems very slow, doctor; when do you think he will regain the use of his limbs?"         :, "Never, I fear," he answered in an undertone. "I see scarcely a ray of hope that he will ever be different from what he is now; yet, as there is a bare possibility of a partial restoration at some far distant day, and as despair can only injure him, I think "it right to talk hopefully,to him; and I trust that you will do the same." "Certainly, as far as I can consist- ently with the truth. Poor, poor fel- low! his trial is a severe one, indeed." The doctor bowed a sad and silent assent, and went on his way, while the lady sought the room of the subject of their conversation, She startedwith dis- may at finding the door something more than ajar; for the doctor had care- lessly left it on the latch, and the wind had blown it;nearly half way open. Mrs. Lambert trembled with fear, lest their colloquy, low as it was, had reached Mr. Falconer's ear, the very   last they would have had to hear it, and the moment she caught sight of his face, she knew it was so. Such an expression of horror and despair" she had never before seen. on any counte- nance. His head was bowed upon his breast, the veins in his forehead were swollen almost to bursting, and great 4rops of agony stood on his brow. He uttered a deep groan as she drew / near; then lifting his head, turned upon her a look so wild, so beseeching in its bitter anguish, that she burst into tears, and with a sudden impulse leaned over him, and drawing his head tenderly to her bosom, stroked back the hair from his forehead, and kissed him as his mother might have done. He was speechless with agony, and for some moments emotion kept her silent also. An unutterable pity for this poor friendless stranger thus stricken down in his manhood's prime, and rendered as helpless and dependent as a new-born infant, filled her heart, and overflowed at her eyes; silently her tears fell on his face, while her bosom heaved with suppressed sobs. He was the first to speak. "Oh," he cried, with' another bitter heart- rending groan, "what have I done to deserve such a fate  Oh that I could follow the advice of Job's wife, 'curse God and dieV '" "Nay," she said, in a tender pitying tone, "rather think upon the words of' the patriarch himself: 'What shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil ' Be- cause he, in his infinite wisdom, has seen fit to take from you one of his great mercies, will you return him only ,iingratitude and rebellion for all the rest?" "What have I to be thankful for?" he asked, almost fiercely, lifting his head, and flashing a look of scorn and   defiance into her eyes. "What is life in my condition, but a burden and a curse? Oh, you know nothing about it," he continued, in a bitter, despair- ing tone, as his head again dropped upon his breast, "you who can move --have always been able to move your limbs and your whole body with an effort of will so slight that you are scarcely conscious of making it-you, I say, can have no conception of the torture of feeling your body but a helpless, heavy immovable log that will not obey even your strongest be- hest, the mightiest exertion of your will. Oh, it is like being chained to a corpse; or worse, being a corpse your- self, and yet alive to the consciousness that you are!" She saw he was in no mood to be reasoned with, and wisely forbore. But most tenderly she expressed her deep sympathy, and spoke to him of One who could enter into his sorrows as no mortal could. One who had power to remove, or to turn them into blessings; and who never refuses his sympathy or help to those who sieek them in the appointed way--through faith and repentance. But he listened coldly, his counte- nance expressing nothing save a deep settled gloom and despair; and finding she could give him neither comfort nor relief, she bade him good-bye, and re- turned to her own home. At the dinner-table she gave an ac- count of the scene. Lilian could scarce command her countenance, or keep her seat, and at length she made an excuse to escape to her own room. Meta soon followed, and found her weeping bitterly. "I would go to him, Lilian, I would not be kept away any longer," she said, putting her arms about her cousin.     "I will; let the gossips say what they like," sobbed Lilian. "Oh, poor, poor Aubrey I what a terrible fate it is!" "Yes. I don't wonder he feels as he does. I do not believe I should be a bit more patient or submissive. But you need not fear the village gossips now, Lilian; for who could imagine for an instant that you were courting. him? Who could be crazy enough to think of marrying a man so utterly helpless that, as he says himself, he is nothing but a living corpse?" "No, I think I am safe," sighed Lilian. "But I would brave all their tongues to speak one word of comfort to him." The duties of the school-room claimned her attention for the next three hours; but released at last from them, she turned lher steps toward the dwelling. of a Mrs. Hood, who kept a private boarding house in the village. It was here Aubrey Falconer lived. :She knew which was his room-a small front one on the second floor- and finding the outer door standing open, she walked in, went softly up the stairs, and knocked ,at-his, which was closed. She heard his voice say, "Come in," and lifting the latch shoe entered, closing the door gently and carefully before she ventured to look about her. There he sat in his chair by the window, the same immovable figure that had sat there all the day long, with no work to do, and nothing to amuse him or while away the tedious hours, but looking out upon the little village street, and the hills and woods beyond. Hiq dinner had been brought up to him, but sent away again untasted; not because his helpless hands refused to lift the food to his lips-for the boy         oy,   who had carried it up offered to do their work for' them-but because the death of hope had taken away his appe- tite so effectually, that he would have turned with. loathing from the most tempting viands culinary skill could have devised. The haggard face, with its dull, heavy eyes, turned towards the visitor, and a sudden flush of joy illumined it. "Ah,. Lilian, Miss Duncome, this is kind!"',' he exclaimed. "How I have longed for a sight of your face." Then recalled to a sense of his situa- tion, by the look of sorrowful sympa- thy in her teardimmed eyes, "I am much changed since last we met," he added, with a deep drawn sigh, "so that, alas, I cannot even so much as rise to give you a seat, or extend a hand to bid you welcome." And his voice trembled with emotion. "I will help myself to a seat, if you will permit me," she said, making a strong effort to speak cheerfully, as she took possession of the chair the doctor had occupied in the morning, and which still stood close at the poor patient's side. "Believe me, it has not been indifference to your sufferings that has kept me away so long," and her sweet gentle eyes looked pleadingly into his. "No, I have understood it," he said; "it was womanly delicacy; but since I am pronounced a helpless cripple-a mere log, in fact, for the rest of my life-that need keep you away no longer. Ah, well, as the doctor says, there are some mercy drops in my cup of woe." "I have never known a trial so terri- ble as yours," she /said, in a tone of deep, earnest sympathy. ' But I have had some that seemed to me very heavy at the time. Florence and I are or- phans, and would have been homeless   but for the kindness of our uncle and aunt; but in all my afflictions, I have found it very sweet and comforting to think of the Apostle's assurance, that 'All things work together for good to them that love God.'" "But it is very different with me," lie answered, in a gloomy tone. "I am not one of those that love God. There have been times in nmy past experience when I thought I did-or that at least I had no feeling of ill-will or hostility towards him-but now," he paused for an instant, then added through his clenched teeth, and in a tone of bitter- ness that thrilled his listener with hor- ror, "now I hate him-yes, I hate him! What have I -done that I should be condemned to this living death? I have wronged no man, but have always lived an honest, upright life; I am no worse than others who live at ease, and seem to have all that heart could wish." For a moment Lilian sat silent; too much shocked and pained to speak. Then she said: "Our Saviour's words to a questioning disciple were, ' What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.' Can you not trust him? can you not believe that this trial is sent in love, and that you will, one day see the needs-be?" He shook his head. "If I were a Christian, your reasoning might hold good," he said, gloomily; "but that I am not and never can be; I am a sin- ner, and as such God hates me." "God ,hates sin, Mr. Falconer, but it is a great mistake to say or to think that he hates the sinner. No, 'God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' And was it' not a world of sinners? And, 'God com- mendeth his love toward us, in that   while we were' yet sinners, Christ died for us.'" He was silent for, some moments, seemingly deep in thought, then turn- ing to her: "It is to me a new view of the subject," he said. "I must con- sider it carefully; and it may be I shall come to agree With you. Ah, Miss Duncome, what a day this has been to me! a day of such horror and despair, such fierce and impotent wrestling against fate, as I trust seldom falls to the lot of poor weak mortals." Tears of true heartfelt sympathy sprang to. her eyes, as she listened to these words, and noted the deep lines of suffering imprinted on his brow and cheek, lines that made him look many years older than when she had last seen him. Mental anguish it had been, far more than physical, for his disease was almost painless. "It is a great trial, Mr. Falconer," she said, "yet I believe that after the first shock of learning the hopelessness of your case is over, you will bear it bravely. I am sure you can if you seek sympathy and help where I have advised." "I fear," he said mournfully, "that I must seem to you intensely selfish in this; but it is not for myself alone that I grieve. I know it will be a terrible blow to my poor sister who is so fond and proud of her only brother. And I had hoped to lighten her burdens and cares; to help to clothe and edu- cate her children, as their station in life demands, but as I know their close- fisted father never will. But now- now alas, instead of the joy of assisting others, will be the eating of the bitter bread of dependence myself. Ah, it is a hard prospect for me! I have al- ways so scorned the thought of owing my support to anything but my own exertions."     "I have had no thought of selfish- ness in, connection with you, or the emotion this shock has caused you. I should have borne it no better myself; and the prospect of a life of forced in- activity must be worse,' far worse, to a man than to a woman." He seemed grateful for her kind words, and thanked her for them. She asked him if there was any lit- tle service she could render him before she left, and he replied that it would be a great favor if she would write, at his dictation, a letter to his sister. "I have been deceiving her," he said, with a sigh, " concealing the real state of the case, in hope of getting better; but she will have to learn the truth, and perhaps it may as well be at once; for it was evident from her last letter, that she was growing very uneasy." It was a sad task, and more than once Lilian had to lay down her pen to wipe away the blinding tears, for her heart ached'sorely at the thought of the poor sister's grief; and she ven- tured at the last to add a few words of comfort not dictated by the brother, but by her own kindly sympathizing spirit. Aubrey told her, as she bade him good-bye, that her visit had done him good, that his heart was much less heavy than before she came; and he begged her to come again. She was glad and thankful to learn that she had been of use to him, and from that day she managed to give him a half hour, or sometimes an hour or more, very frequently, reading or talking to him, or writing his letters. And no one' objected, or regarded her movements with suspicion; for the story of Doctor Brick's opinion had flown'on the wings of the wind, and who could suppose that a girl like Lilian, in the hey-day of youth and   beauty, would for a moment think of throwing herself away on a man in Aubrey Falconer's helpless condition? Least of all did he dream of such a thing. He loved her as his own soul, and day by day that love grew deepei and stronger; but knowing that she could never be his, unless by some miracle his lost health could --be re- stored, he resolutely turned his thoughts from the future, and lived only in the present. Lilian, too, drew a curtain over her own heart, and would not look into it;, enough for her that she was throwing a little sunlight on his darkened path- way, that she was comforting him in his -great sorrow, helping him to beai his heavy burden, and leading him to One who could sustain both it -and him: she would be content with this, and leave the future with her God. Gradually a ,great chailge had been wrought in Aubrey's feelings; fierce rebellion, gloom and despair giving place to submission and patient endu- rance. He had begun to see that even this dark cloud had a silver lining; that judgment was tempered with mercy even in his sad case, and that to him, as to many another sorely-tried soul, good might be brought out of evil; yea, that it already had been so; for he had learned to kiss the hand that smote him, and by means of this afflic- tion had become possessor of the Chris- tian's hope. Greatly did Lilian rejoice in this change, and fervent were the thanks- givings that went up from her full heart. CHAPTER V. NEARLY three months have rolled by since the day when the light of hope-hope of restoration to health,   and the free use of his limbs-was so suddenly quenched in Aubrey's breast; and still the same drooping, helpless, immovable figure, he sits in the same spot-by the window that looks out upon the village street, and the hills and woods beyond. Over these a change has passed; the forests have put off their royal autumn robes, and donned the livery of winter; they are dressed as for a bridal, in gar- ments of snowy whiteness, while each little twig and spray sparkles in the sunshine, as though studded with cost- liest gems; the hills, the fields the gardens, and the streets of the little town wear the same fine spotless robes, and here and there they have fallen upon the sleeping river also. The snow gives back a crackling sound under the feet of the passers-by, and the merry jingle of sleigh bells comes up clear and distinct through the frosty air. Yet. over the face Of nature has not passed'a greater change than has been wrought in that of the pale watcher, who looks out upon the gay scene. The tempest of passion, of horror and despair has swept by, and it wears a calm and peaceful expression now; a look of patient resignation and quiet submission to his sad fate. But his breast heaves with a heavy sigh as he thinks of the great alteration in his prospects since, one year ago, he came to Chilford full of life, energy, and hope; looking forward to a period when he should rise to eminence in his chosen profession, acquire wealth, and become a man of influence among his fellow citizens. All that is past now, and no wonder that he sighs when he thinks of it; yet anon a glad smile flits over his wan features as thought travels on and recalls that precious, new-born hope   of a better and more, enduring life be- yond the narrow verge of time. A light step sounded on the stairs there was a gentle rap at his door, and the next moment Lilian, fresh and blooming as a rose, stood smiling at his side. The Christmas holidays had released her from the school-room, and she had come earlier than her wont But she was none the less welcome, and though she had brought a bit of fancy work and stayed several hours, he was loath to see her go. "Ah, but I must," she said at length, rising and putting on her hood and shawl. "Flo will wonder what has become of me; for I promised to help her with some of her Christmas doings." She bade him good-bye, and tripped lightly from the room, but had hardly reached the foot of the stairs when she discovered that she had forgotten her work. She hurried back for it, and softly opened the door, thinking to give him a little surprise. But his head wag bowed upon his breast, and he did not perceive her entrance. A deep groan struck her ear, and then came the words--uttered with passionate vehemence, and in tones of anguish and despair that went to her very heart--"O   Lilian, my Lilianl so loved, so loved, but lost, lost to me forever!" She closed the door and glided to his side; and he looked up to see her standing there, regarding him with eyes full of tenderest pity, and deepest, truest love. Tears were trembling in them too; bright drops that rolled quickly down her cheek as she laid her hand on the-helpless ones before her, and leaning over him, softly whis- pered, "No, Aubrey, not lost, if so loved. What is there to come between     our hearts, to forbid the love that God himself has -implanted there?" Joy unutterable sparked in his fine dark eye as his glance met hers, and read there the fullest confirmation -of her-words; but it died out again on the instant, as a vain effort to stretch forth his arms and clasp her to his heart recalled the remembrance of his helpless state, Again his head fell upon his breast, and with a bitter groan, he cried out vehemently, "No, dearest, loveliest of women; such happiness is not for me I What! ask you to link your fate with mine?-a fate so terrible that heart and flesh are ofttimes ready to fail at the thought of it? Nay, I could not be so base--s utterly selfish and cruel as to thus take advantage of your generous love and devotion. Nay, my darling, rather let me bear my heavy burden alone, until it shall please the Lord to bid me lay it down forever; than that you should thus sacrifice yourself." "Ah, Aubrey," she said, "love- true love-deems nothing a sacrifice that is done or borne for the sake of the beloved one." "O Lilian," lie cried, raising his head and gazing tenderly into her face, "what a treasure you offer me in your priceless love! But what have I to give in return? A heart that adores you, it is true-a love that would fain shelter you in its arms, and suffer-not the winds of heaven to blow too roughly upon you; but, alas! a body that is more useless than a 'log of wood. I cannot be to. you a protector and pro- vider; never aught but a useless bur- den upon your hands. Helpless as an infant, .I can hardly call myself a man." 'CMind is the measure of the man," she answered, "and, thank, God, yours   is bright and clear as ever. And to me he lhas given health and strength; so that if you cannot be my protector and provider, I can be yours; and 'twere sweeter, Aubrey," she added, in low whispered words, and with a lovely blush, and shy drooping of the long silky lashes upon her glowing cheek--"'twere sweeter far to be as hands and feet to you, than the petted darling of another."  ' The low, sweet tones and sweeter words thrilled his heart with glad- ness inexpressible; while she--over- whelmed with confusion the moment she had uttered them-sank down upon her knees on the floor beside him, and hid her burning face against the arm of his chair. Neither spoke again for many min- utes. Joy unutterable swelled  in Aubrey's heart, yet neyer had his help- lessness been so torturing as now, when he had the riight, but not the. power,: to clasp her in his arms and call her all his own. "God bless you for those words, my darling," he murmured, at last; in tones quivering with emotion; "but I cannot see your face, O love, let me look at 'you!" She rose to her feet and turned to- wards him, showing a countenance radi- ant with blushes and smiles, and eyes, in which bright tears were glistening, and that drooped in maiden modesty betieath the ardor of his gaze. "Kiss me, love," he entreated. And their lips met for an instant, thus seal- ing their betrothal. She could refuse nothing to his helplessness; but turned away again blushing rosy red. But the sun kad set, the shadows of approaching night were stealing into the room, and they must part. Bidding him a hasty good-bye, she left him with a promise to come again to-morrow.   Lilian's heart was singing a song of joy and gratitude as she hastened homeward, almost running over the crisp white snow that covered the side- walks. There had not, been time yet for any calculation of ways and means, any thought of care for the future, or of aught in the wide world, but that she was loving and beloved. As she reached her uncle's house, and passed into the lighted hall, she was met face to face by Harry Gris- wold, who had evidently just stepped out of the half-open parlor door. She looked at him, and was struck with the expression of his face, which was that of a man who had just re- ceived a crushing blow. Lilian started back with an exclama- : tion of surprise and commiseration, but bowing a hasty good-evening he rushed past her, and was gone. "Florence!" murmured Lilian, half i aloud, " O poor Harry, why did you z care for her?" She slowly ascended the stairs, and i reaching her own room, found it empty i and dark; but Florence entered the next moment, bringing a light.   i "Is that you, Lil?" she said, in a ] careless tone. "How late you are, to- ( night; the tea bell will ring presently; x and it's cold here too, so you'd better take off your things and come down to E the sitting-room where there's a good I fire." "I'm not cold, and I want to have a f little private talk with you, Flo," re- I plied the elder sister. "What have G you been saying to Harry Gris- wold?"  "I  don't know that you have any a right to ask," said Florence, coolly; tl "but I don't mind telling you that he c] has asked me to be his wife, and I have told him that, being no believer in the . nonsense about love in a cottage, I I   f can't think of such a thing at present; i nor can I bind myself to wait until he e grows rich, as that is not likely to be - very soon."' t " O Florence I And Harry is such a , noble fellow, and I'm sure you like rhim well enough to be happy without t wealth, if you would only make up your mind not to care for it. And be- , sides, he has enough to make you very comfortable; and you have given him a good deal pf encouragement." "I'm not going to be a fool, if you are, Lilian," answered Florence, scorn- fully.  "Read this, will you?"  And she  placed a letter in her sister's hand. ' Lilian gave a slight start as, she recognized the chirography; then hold- ing it to the light, she glanced hastily over it. It was an offer of marriage from Mr. Dana, addressed to Florence, and he said that he would come for her reply in a fortnight.' "And do you mean to accept this?" Lilian asked, with a glance of surprise at her sister. "I told you I didn't mean to be a fool, as you were a year ago," replied Florence, with half averted face; "when wealth and position are offered me, I shall not reject them." "And so you will sdll yourself for gold!" groaned Lilian. " O Florence, Florence, what would our honorable Christian parents have said to this? for you know that you do-not love Mr. Dana; and that you -do love Harry Griswold." "I am not accountable to you for my actions," answered Florence, angrily; "and when two men offer themselves, I have a right to take my choice." The tea bell interrupted them, and Florence hastily left the room,.while Lilian lingered behind a moment, to     remove her bonnet and shawl, and f smooth her hair.  Her brain was in a whirl as she v  went down to the dining-room. Could it be that Florence would do this a thing-give her hand to a man she x did not love, taking him merely for his' wealth, and reject the honorable pro- c posals of one to whom she had given 1 every encouragement, and who had al- i ready won her heart? And then her own affairs. What i would Florence- what would her aunt ' and uncle think of the engagement X she had entered into that afternoon?  Would they not consider it the height, 1 pof madness and folly? She could not  hope it would appear to them in- any a other light, and yet -,and yet she must, she would cleave to him whose happi- ness she had, now a right to make her first earthly care. Still, she would put off the dreaded storm; she would not yet tell them of the great sacrifice her love would make. But her heart began to grow heavy with care. On her would devolve the burden that usually falls to the lot of the stronger sex; and how. was she to sustain it? Her little school scarcely supported herself; how was she to make it support her husband also? She carried this anxiety to the Lord, and, asked him to help her, making her way plain before her face, and pro-. viding the needed food and raiment for which he had commanded her to take no thought. Then resting on the promises, she slept the sweet, untrou- bled sleep of careless childhood. Her face was very bright as she en- tered Aubrey's room the next morning, but the look that met hers was touch- ipg in its sad resignation. "What is it, my friend?" she asked, coming to his side. "Ah, Lilian," he answered, mourn-         , .   fully, "what a selfish' wretch I have been i I slept scarcely a wink all night for thinking of it." "And how so?" she asked, with ail assumption of playfulness. "I have not discovered that you were selfish." "Ahl" he sighed, "what but that could have led" me to let you see my love, and engage yourself to me--to me, a useless cumberer of the ground?" "Aubrey," she replied, while a burn- ing blush suffused her whole face, "why will you compel me again and again to an unwomanly avowal of my love? Must, I assure you that it is to' the full- as deep and strong as your own, and that I can never be happy anywhere but at your side?" She turned away to hide her crim- son cheeks, but his face was radiant with happiness. An hour-two hours passed rapidly away, and Lilian bade him good-bye, and took her departure. At the foot of the stairs she was in- tercepted by the landlady, who begged her to come into her parlor for a moment, as she particularly wanted to speak to her.;. "What is it, Mrs. Hood?" asked Lilian, declining the offered seat. "Please be brief; for it is near our dinner hour, and I promised my aunt I would be there in season." "Yes," returned the landlady. "I just wanted to speak to you about that poor cripple up stairs." Lilian could not help wincing at the name applied to him who was so dear to her; yet, alas i it was too true - to be objected to. ,  "You see, Miss Duncome," continued Mrs. Hood, " my husband and me, we've got to look out for ourselves and , our children, ard can't afford to keep boarders that don't pay." " "I think Mr. Falconer's board has ,   been paid thus far," rather indignantly interrupted Lilian. "Well, yes; but then you see I know' his money's all gone, and he can't earn nothing now, seein' he's quite lost the use of himself, and never will be any better--so.. I hear the doctor says-and, as I was saying, we can't afford to board him free; and I'm not willin' to keep him on unless somebody that's got means, and can be relied on, will promise to see that it's paid.": "You would not turn him into the street, I suppose," said Lilian, coldly. "No; but there's a poor-house that's kept a purpose for folks that can't take care of themselves, and hain't got neither friends nor means." "He shall not go there," said Lilian, turning away to hide the tears of min- gled anger and   pain that suddenly started to her eyes at these unfeeling words. "I will undertake that some- thing shall be done; so you need not fear to keep him.  You have not lost V a cent by him yet, and you shall not." i She opened the door, and walked l out as she spoke. "Very well, then, it's all right," I said Mrs. Hood, following her to the t front door. "I see you're a friend o' o his'n, and I thought I'd just speak to you about it."           t A   few  scalding  tears fell from s Lilian's eyes as she walked quickly a down  the street; but she wiped them b away, and   began to consider what w could be done. She thought the best se plan would be to lay the case before her uncle; and she determined to do N! so at the earliest opportunity.   as "He has such a kind heart, and has sl felt deeply for poor Aubrey. I'm sure w he will manage to help him somehow," bt she said to herself.  "But it can only to be present relief, and I must find -a  pa 3   [y way to support him; for he is my charge now;" and her heart thrilled I with mingled pleasure and pain at the ie thought. is She met her uncle at the gate. He jr was just coming home to his dinner. e  "Well, Lil," was his smiling saluta. e tion, " you look as if you had the world d on your shoulders, child. What is the s trouble?" i  She replied by a brief account of her t interview with Mrs. Hood. "Ah, is that all? Then chase away e the clouds from your brow," he said, cheerfully. "Griswold spoke to me 3 about it some days ago, and we have t already raised sufficient to keep him t for two or three months longer; and in the meantime we must be contriving some plan for his permanent support. But, come, don't let us stand here in the cold," he added, opening the gate and motioning to her to pass in before him. "Thank you, uncle, how good you are," she said, looking up gratefully into his face as she stepped past him. "Am   I?" replied he, in as lightly sur- prised tone. "Possibly Aubrey might think so t but I don't see that I am obliging you in this." Her heart gave a   bound at the thought of his probable anger when he should learn why she looked upon it as a  favor done to herself; and burfing blushes dyed her cheek; but her face was turned from him,-and he did not see them. "An   invitation for you, Lil," said Meta, at the dinner-table; "we are asked to asleighing party to-night. 'I should have thought Harry Griswold would have come for Flo, of course, but it's Charlie Dale; and Fred Whar- ton requests the pleasure of your com- pany and mine. Shall you accept?"     "I don't know," replied Lilian, doubtfully; " perhaps I may." "There, that reminds me," said Mr. Lambert, " that' I've been thinking ,poor Falconer must be pining for a breath, of fresh air. I mean to take my sleigh round there this afternoon, and see if I can get him out for a little ride." Mrs. Lambert said," Do, my dear," while Lilian looked up at him with sparkling eyes; causing him again to wonder why she should be so grateful for kindness done to "that poor crip- ple;" It was a pleasant surprise to Aubrey, weary with his long confinement in- doors, when a cutter, with its prancing steed, and merrily jingling bells, drove up to the boarding-house door, and Mr. Lambert springing out, ran up to his room and invited him to take a ride. "Thank you a thousand times; I should,like nothing better," answered the invalid, with a smile and a sigh; "but, as I cannot move, hand or foot, how am I to take advantage of your kindness?" "Oh, we will manage that easily enough," said Mr. Lambert, cheerily, glancing about the room as be spoke; "you are light and thin, and I am strong. I will carry you down in my arms. But where shall I find your overcoat? Ah, I see! there it hangs behind the door. Let me slip it -on you, and then I will carry you down and wrap you up so in the buffalo robes, that you'll hardly be able to feel the cold." / He was taking down the coat and putting it upon the young man as he spoke. Then raising him gentlyAin his arams he bore him, with kind careful- ness, but with ierfect. ease, down the 'stairs, and in five minutes more they were gliding swiftly over the snow.   It was a, bright and ,not very cold day, and Aubrey enjoyed the fresh air, the pleasant motion, and the cheerful sights and sounds, as those only cab who have been long debarred from such pleasures. For awhile he thought of nothing. else; then a casual remark of Mr. Lambert's, in which Lilian's name was introduced, reminded him that here was one who had almost a parent's in- terest in, and authority over her, and who might very naturally feel a strong reluctance to seeing her unite her fate 'to that of a man so helpless as himself. He remembered, too, all the kindness shown him by both the uncle and aunt of his betrothed, and blushed with shame, as he thought that ,they might feel justly incensed against him, and ready to accuse him of ingratitude, in having won the affections of the young girl, and told her of his love. As these thoughts-pressed upon him, he grew silent and confused, and began questioning in his own mind, whether he ought not to make Mr. Lambert ac- quainted with the existing state of affairs between Lilian and himself. Mr. Lambert wondered at the sudden silence of his companion, and glancing at his face, noticed its troubled look. "Ah, poor fellow," he thought, "he is grieving over his helpless condition; and no wonder; it is terrible to think what a blight has fallen upon his pros- pects-so early in life too." Then he exerted himself anew for the entertainment of the invalid, but was not surprised at the ill success of his efforts. "I fear you are growing weary," he said, at length; "but here we are, al- most at Mrs. Hood's door again, and in five minutes we will have you rest- ing on your bed." "Thank you; I do begin to be a lit,   tie tired now; but it has been a very great treat, and I don't know how I shall ever thank you for this and your many other acts of kindness," mur- mured Aubrey, with half averted face. "Tut, nonsense! we wont talk about thanks for the trifling services I have been able to render you. If I could restore you to health now, it would be worth while." Theydrew up at Mrs. Hood's gate as Mr. Lambert spoke; he sprang out, fastened his horse, and taking Aubrey again in his arms, carried him up, and laid him on his bed. He was turning away with a hasty "Good afternoon, I hope you'll be none the worse, but rather the better for your ride," when the poor fellow exclaimed, with almost a gasp, "Stay one moment, Mr. Lambert-I have something to tell you." Mr. Lambert paused with a look of surprise and concern at the evident agitation and distress .of his young friend; but it changed to an expres- sion of mingled anger and scorn as he listened to the story which Aubrey I stammered out in a few broken sen- I tences. Turning away with a gesture 1 of impatience and contempt, he strode I up and down the room.        X "If you expect me to give my con- ] sent to this preposterous affair, you ^ will be very much disappointed," he v said, at length. "I'll never see. Lilian so completely thrown  away if I can c help it. And I  had a better opinion r of you, Aubrey Falconer, than to sup- h pose you could be guilty of so mean an s action as to attempt to appropriate to yourself a  girl like Lilian-one whose e beauty, talents, and sweetness of dis- a position entitle her to aspire to one of the best matches in the land.' Such a w girl to throw herself away on a man it who--however kind 'and amiable-- ,  :   y could never make her a living--never I be a husband to her in anything but r the name! What a sacrifice it would r- be!" and he lifted his hands in horror e. at the thought, adding, "If you have a t speck of generosity or manliness left, e you will release her from an engage- d ment which nothing but her womanly e pity for your forlorn condition could have led her to enter into." e  "I do,' I do," groaned poor Aubrey, , turning awaylhis face. "I have been r terribly selfish. It would be a fearful I sacrifice; though, God knows, no man could love her better than I do. But , tell her-tell her she is free," he gasped. "That is right," said Mr. Lambert, r in a softened tone. "I'm afraid I've spoken harshly; but a man of your rsense must see how absurd the whole thing  is-how  utterly impossible it would be for me to allow my niece thus to ruin her prospects for life." Aubrey gave a silent assent, still keeping his face turned away, that Mr. Lambert might not see how every fea- ture was convulsed with anguish. The last spark of light and hope seemed to have died out of his existence, leaving naught but an intense longing to lay his weary, useless body in the grave, and be at rest. He did not hear Mr. Lambert's adieu, or know when he went out and left him alone to wrestle with his mighty grief. Mrs. Lambert eWas the only occupant of the sitting-room;  seated in a low rocking chair by the window, she plied her needle with unwearied industry, softly humming to herself the while. The door opened, and her husband entered with an unusually hasty step, and an agitated air. "What is the matter, my dear? what has happened?" she asked, look- ing up at him in some surprise. "Almost the worst thing that could     have happened, I might say, I believe," ne replied, throwing himself into a chair on the other side of the fire., '0. Maria, what fools we have been- you and I!" "How so?" she asked, with a slight smile. "I had really been flattering myself that we were quite 'a sensible couple." He replied with a repetition of Aubrey's story. "Is it possible!" cried his wife, dropping her work to lift up her hands with a gesture of dismay. "Can she think of throwing herself away in that manner?. Oh, dear, dear! what is to be done?" "We ought never to have allowed her to go there. I shall never forgive myself." "But, my dear, who could have foreseen this.? and I doubt if we could have prevented her. Lilian is one that will have her own way in some things." "She shan't marry him I I'll never consent to itI," be exclaimed, rising and beginning to pace the floor in an excited way. "Then she'll do it without your con- sent; she's just the woman to pling to the man she loves, through everything; and I would not give a penny for her 'if she wasn't." "He's released her-told me to tell her she was free." "It wont make a bit of difference; only she'll pity him the more, and love him all the better. Take my advice, Ralph, and don't oppose her; it will only make her the more headstrong." But he did not take her advice. He summoned Lilian, and in very strong terms, told her what he thought of her engagement, and almost commanded her to give it up. "Uncle," she answered, With dignity, '       ,    "I am of age. I passed my twenty- first birthday some months ago; there- fore, I have a right to decide this matter for myself. "But I do not forget-I can never forget-how kind you have been to me in my orphanhood," she added, in a softened -tone, the tears filling her eyes. "And if my own happiness alone was at stake, I think I should yield to your wishes; but Aubrey"-her face flushed painfully, and she cast down her eyes, while her voice took a tender, pitying tone-" my poor Aubrey, stricken down by disease, helpless, friendless-has nothing left on earth but me. And," she added, looking up into her uncle's face again, and speaking with calm decision, "I cannot, will not, give him up?. '"Foolish girl! It was only for your own good I wished it," said Mr. Lam- bert, turning away with a disappointed sigh. "I know that much," said Lilian, warmly. "I am about to take up a heavy burden; and you would save me from it, even in spite of myself; but I think it is the one the Lord has appointed for me, and He will help me, and give me strength to bear it." "And why do you think that, Lil- ian?" asked her aunt. "Because He has formed our hearts for mutual love, and His providence has thrown us together," she answered, with glistening eyes. 'Ah, well,".' said her uncle, "a wil- fill womanwill have her own way, and I suppose you must have yours; but I am loath, loath to see the sacrifice. X Have you counted the cost, Lilian? ; He will never be able to do anything r for his own support, much less for I yours; neither of you have anything, and thus far you have hardly been , able to support ,yourself; hlow thlen do   you expect to be able to sustain a double burden?" "I have made no plaus, uncle; I cannot see my way yet, but I believe it will be made plain," she answered, with simple, childlike faith. CHAPTER VI., ALMOST an hour had passed since Mr. Lambert's departure had left Aubrey Falconer alone with his crush- ing anguish; and still he lay there vainly striving to put away the long- ing desire to lay down .his heavy bur- den forever. Oh the gloom, the'more than Egyptian darkness that seeemed to have suddenly descended upon his, pathway, no ray of light pierced it, and the cry of his heart was, "It is better for me to die, than to live I My soul would choose strangling and death rather than life!" A stumbling step was heard on the stairs, and in the passage without ;.the door opened, and a red-headed, freckled faced boy of ten or twelve appeared, bearing a small, tray with a plate of toast and a cup of tea upon it. "Here's your supper, Mr. Falconer," he said, " and I'm to stay and feed you. Can you eat it lying down that a way?" "I don't wish any, Max," replied the invalid, feebly; " you may take it down again." "Why, it's cream toast," said the  boy, setting the waiter down on a chair, sticking both hands in his pockets, and gazing, with stupid wonder at the pros- trate form before him--" it's cream toast, and mother she took lots o' trou- ble a fixin' it. Better try it. I reckon you'll filnd it mighty good." Aubrey shook his head, keeping his face turned quite away from the curi- ous eyes of the lad.   "Be you sick?" asked Max. "No, but I want nothing but soli- tude." "Solitude," muttered the boy, to him- self, " be switched if I know what that' is; 'taint nothin' we've got in the house, I reckon." "I only want you to go away and leave me alone," said Aubrey, over- hearing the soliloquy. "Take the waiter with you; I want nothing to- night." Max picked it up and stumbled out, slamming the door after him. He stood a moment in the passage. "Carry it down," he muttered, "guess I won't then; leastways not jest the same way as I fetched it up. Cream toast ain't to be got every day; and tea's not so bad neither." He stepped to the end of the passage, farthest from the stairs, and seating himself on the floor, fell to work with such good-will, that plate and cup were emptied in a marvellously short space of time. He rose, wiping his mouth, with a grin of satisfaction, and, waiter in hand, made his way down to the kitchen, where his mother was busy preparing supper for the rest of her boarders. "Well, Max," she said, looking up from her frying-pan, "how did the toast go?" "Right fast," he answered, demurely, setting his burden on the table. "He liked it, then, did he?" "Didn't say," said Max. "There! that's just the way," re- marked his mother, in a provoked tone, as she opened her oven-door and shut it again with a bang, "I may kill my- self slaving to make things good, and never get a word of thanks or praise for my trouble." "You get the money though; and that's better."     "Hold your tongue, or I'll box your ears," was the angry rejoinder. "Go right along, and call your father to supper." The sun was nearing the horizon, and flooding Aubrey's little room with gold and crimson light; but he shut his eyes and turned his face tothe wall. Sunlight, and joy, and gladness were not for him. No, the darkness and gloom of midnight would better accord with his feelings. But a soft cool hand was gently laid on his burning brow, and a voice sweeter than music whis- pered, "My poor friend, how- you have been suffering Would I could have prevented it." "Lilian, my Lilian!" he cried, look- ing up eagerly into the sweet, fair face bending over him, so full of tender pity and yearning affection. "Oh no, no, not mine; for you are free! How could I have been so terribly selfish?" he groaned, turning away his face. "Nay, Aubrey, do not turn from me," she said, half sorrowfully. "I will not accept my freedom; I will not give. back yours to you; for you are mine;. mine as long as God spares us to each other." "O Lilian, do not tempt me with your sweet woids and looks," he cried, vehemently. "I have not strength to resist; for I am very weak, and love and happiness are so dear. Leave me, my love, my life, my light; leave me, or selfishness will get the better of me again, and I shall not be able to cast from me this joy-this great joy of call- ing you mine own." She passed her arm about his neck, she laid her cheek close to his, and low and sweet came the words, "'Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from foll'bwing after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodg- est; I will lodge; thy people shall be   my people, and thy God my God. Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me."' Silence fell on them both, a delicious silence which neither cared to break; a deep hush was in the room, the sounds of busy life seeming far away. Gradually the rosy light faded out of the sky, and the bright and twinkling stars looked down upon the snow- covered streets, where men were hurry- ing home from their daily toil, or re- turning from their evening meal to the workshop or the store; shadows were stealing into the corners; the lovers could now scarcely discern the features of each others faces, and Lilian felt that she must go. She bent over him again, and as once before, their lips met. :"Ah," he murmured, "I 'cannot, cannot put this great happiness from me. God forgive me if I am doing wrong, in thus allowing you to sacrifice yourself." "I do not," she said. "I choose the lot I would prefer above all others. God himself has joined our hearts to- gether, and man shall not part us asunder." As soon as released from the inter- view with her aunt and uncle, Lilian had, stolen to her lover's side, rightly conjecturing how much her presence was needed there, to soothe and com- fort, and reassure him of her unaltera- ble love, and determination to be his. On her return she found the family already seated about the supper-table. One glance at Meta's wet eyes, and the flushed, angry, tear-swollen face of Florence, told her that her secret was one no longer. The meal passed almost in silence;   then, as they rose from the table, Flor- ence burst out in a storm of reproaches and entreaties, mingled with angry tears and sobs. "She could not, she would not see, her sister thus throw herself away. It would make her hate Aubrey Falconer, and wish he had died on that day when he fell in the street. How would Lilian love such a poor, worthless creature better than her own flesh and blood?" Then Meta stole to her cousin's side, and clinging round her neck, wept, and entreated her to give up all thoughts of such a union. It was an ordeal hard to endure; but the thought of the helpless one whose all she was, enabled Lilian to pass through it unmoved from her pur- pose; though not without many tears, and some angry rejoinders, for which her conscience smote her long after- wards. It was a bitter trial to Florence; and that not merely on her own ac- count; for with all her selfishness, she really loved her sister, and could not bear to see her ichoosing a lot that seemed to her so hard and dreary. Yet she was not willing to'listen to any advice or entreaty from Lilian in regard to her own choice. She liked Harry Griswold, and would have married him had no wealthier suitor appeared. She had given him great encouragement during the sum- mer and fall; for Mr. Dana's visits had at that time become so unfrequent that her hopes of winning him had nearly vanished. But she had met him again, a few weeks before, in a: neighboring town,'where she was pay- ing. a visit, had exerted her powers anew, and, as we have seen, with such success that an, offer of marriage from nim had reached her on the same day   that Harry Griswold had laid hisheart and modest fortune at her feet. The stormy scene in the dining-room was at length brought to a sudden conclusion by the sound of sleigh bells approaching the house; reminding the girls that they were engaged for a ride, and that the hour for it had. come. There was a hasty rushing up stairs, a rapid bathing of eyes, and donning of hoods and cloaks, and Florence and Meta descended to the parlor, where Mrs. Lambert sat, entertaining their escorts. Lilian had. excused herself from ap- pearing or going with the party, on the plea of a headache, which was quite true; and the others concealed the traces of their recent agitation by keeping their faces turned from the light, and half covered with their veils. Mrs. Lambert watched them as they drove off;' then, as the sound of the sleigh bells died away in the distance, 'she went back to the dining-room, where she found Lilian leaning against the mantelpiece in an attitude of deep dejection. "Never mind, my dear," she said, going up to her and laying her hand caressingly on her shoulder; "don't fret about it. I suppose you had learned to love him before this sad ill- ness; and if so, I don't blame you for clinging to him in spite of everything. If such a thing were to happen to your uncle, I'm sure I shouldn't love him any the less; but rather more.-I should pity him so." Lilian answered only with tears, and . her aunt went on. "I dare say it seems to you, we are all very unkind' to oppose you as we do; but you know, my dear, it is for your own sake." "Principally, I have no doubt; but I can see well enough that Florence thinks I'll be disgracing her."     Lilian's tone was very bitter. "But you must try not to mind that, if you feel that you are doing right," replied her aunt, soothingly. "If, as I very much fear, Florence intends to marry Mr. Dana merely for his wealth, while another has her heart, I think she is doing far worse." Lilian retired early that night, but lay awake a long time thinking and planning, and sending up many a prayer that some way might be opened by which she could support herself and the helpless one to whom she had plighted her troth. She fell asleep at length, resting upon the promises, and calmly confident that her request would be granted. Several days passed without any un- usual occurrence, and Lilian was still casting about in her mind what she should do; when her uncle came in one evening with a package in his hand, and a light in his eye that mnade his wife exclaim, "Well, Ralph, you bring good news. Pray, let us have it at once!" "Who told you that, Maria?" he asked, with a gleeful 'laugh, as he handed an open letter to Lilian, who glanced over it, and uttered an ex- clamation of joyful surprise. "What is it? Do tell us at once "  cried Mrs. Lambert, Florence, and Meta, in a breath. Lilian looked up with a face all smiles and tears, while her uncle pro- ceeded to explain that a distant rela- tion on their father's side, one for, whose loss they could feel no grief, as he was an entire stranger to them, had lately died, leaving a large fortune; to a portion of which--about ten thou- sand, dollars, to be equally divided be- twen them-Lilian and Florence had' fallen heirs. The delight of Florence knew no   bounds, while Lilian's joy, though quieter, was not less deep and heart- felt. Most fervent were her thanks- givings as she knelt in prayer that night; and, until sleep came to calm her excited! brain, it was busy with plans for disposing to the best advan- tage of her newly'acquired property. Quite a fortune it seemed to her; and, indeed, in those days-some twenty- five years ago-and in that part of the country, five thousand dollars was a sum by no means to be despised. Lilian waked at an early hpur, and instantly her thoughts reverted to the subject that had filled them on falling asleep. She had been unable then to settle upon anything that seemed feasi- ble; but now an idea Came to her like a flash, and by the time the breakfast' bell rang, she had a well-matured plan ready to lay before' her uncle for his ,approval. It was a settled point with her, that she and Aubrey must have a home of thleir own. She had heard her uncle mention in a casual way, a day or. two before, that a farm on the outskirts of the town was -offered for sale on very easy terms; the owner being an emi- grant from New England, and anxious to return thither, on account of the ex- cessive home-sickness of his wife. It was a very pretty place.; the land was excellent; some of it heavily tim. bered, but a number of Acres under cultivation; and there was a neat and comfortable dwelling upon it. Lilian had decided to buy this farm, if her uncle and Aubrey approved. It would take half her little fortune,' but she thought she could hardly make a better investment. A part of the re- maining half would furnish her house, and stock the farm; and what was left could be laid ,by in the savings bank for at rainy day; though a' portion   would have to be used to live upon until their fall crops should be gathered in and sold. She knew but little of farming, prac- tically, but she felt confident that by a diligent study of works on agriculture, she could soon qualify herself to over- see and direct laborers whom she could hire. And in the meantime she hoped to secure the services of one who would be, both able and willing to work for her with head and hands. This was a man named Ezra Ward, who had grown up on the farms of her grandfather and father; having been taken by the former when a very little child, an orphan and friendless, and left, at the old man's death, as a legacy to his son. . Mr. Duncome, the father of Lilian and Florence, had accepted the trust, given the boy such advantages for education as the country schools in the neighborhood could furnish, trained him into a good practical farmer, and paid him liberal wages, until he saw fit to marry and set up for himself. Ezra's choice was Deborah Jones, a girl who had been taught housework and cooking by Mrs. Duncome, and had lived as maid-of-all-woik in the family for a number of years. Lilian had lost sight of them upon the removal of hersielf and her sister to the west, shortly after their parents' death; but within a few weeks she had received a letter from Ezra, stating that he was not prospering, and that he and Deborah had both been seized with a desire to remove to the west; and particularly to get near the chil- dren bf their old employer, to whom they were greatly attached; and asking if she knew of any opening for them there. She had replied that she did not; but now, she thought, she could write   in a different strain, inviting them to share her home as they had done that of her parents in former days. She unfolded these plans to her un- cle, directly after breakfast. At the first mention of her wish to purchase the farm, he shook his head and smiled, as if he thought the scheme a very silly and childish one; but he quite came round to her views, when he had heard the whole. "With a slight alteration, I think it will do capitally," he said. "And what is that, uncle?" "That I furnish your house, buy the wedding trousseau, and help you to stock the farm." "Dear uncle, how good and kind you are!" she cried, throwing her arms round his neck and giving him a kiss. "Ah, Lilian," he sighed, patting her cheek, and looking at her with a kind  of sorrowful admiration, " if you wil throw yourself away, all I can do is to try to make you as comfortable under the sacrifice as possible." "I shall be happier with . Aubrey, helpless as he is, than I ever could be with any other man, my dear uncle," she answered, earnestly. "And now, will you be so kind as to attend to this business for me?" "I will. But do you wish to go out to Mr. Cook's, and look at the place first? perhaps it would be as well. I will take you there this afternoon, if you like." "I would like it very much. And let us ask aunt to go with us." "Very well, I will leave you to ex- plain it all to her," he said, looking smilingly at his wife, who had just come into the room; then taking up his hat, he hurri d away to his place of business. Lilian talked the matter all over with her aunt, receiving her unqualified     approval of the whole plan, then ran off to repeat the story to her sister and Meta. Florence heard it with a lowering brow, and an impatience that she made no attempt to conceal. "Now listen to me, Lilian," she said, at the first pause in her sister's narra- tive, "I do wish you would - hear rea- son and give up this foolish match. I'll warrant you'll repent of it when it's too late. You were far too good a match for him in the first place; and I'm sure you are now, when he's crip- pled for life, and you have become quite wealthy." "No, Florence, I shall not repent; my love is too deep and true for that; and I am very thankful that God has given me thie means to support him in his helplessness. So far from consider- ing this accession of fortune a reason for giving up my choice, I look, upon it as having made my way very plain." "Very well, I've warned you; you are fwaking your own bed, and you'll have to lie in it hard as you may find it; but when you grow weary of it, just call to mind that I, at least, did what' I could to save you; and that you have only your own obstinacy to blame for your troubles." "Rest assuredi I will never blame you, dear," replied' Lilian, putting her arm about her sister's waist, and look- ing into her face with loving eyes, in which the tears were trembling. "I am giving my hand where my heart has already gone; and, O Florence, let me persuade you to,do the same. You have not yet pledged yourself to Mr. Dana; and your present means, added to what Harry has, would make you both very comfortable; and, Flor- ence, I know you love him." Meta had been called from the room. a moment before, so, that they were-   alone; else Lilian would not have ventured to speak so plainly to her sister. "I would like to know what right {you have to, make that assertion," said Florence, coloring violently. "I have never told you or any one else that I, cared for Harry Griswold; and I tell you now, once for all, I've made up my mind to marry Mr. Dana; and it is not worth while for any one to ad- vise me to do differently. You will not take my advice; and can't expect me to take yours." Lilian turned away with a sigh. She felt that her sister was making, shipwreck of her happiness, while she was powerless to prevent it. But pleasanter thoughts quickly banished these useless regrets, and hurrying through her share of house- hold duties, she donned hood and shawl, and was soon bearing her glad tidings to one nlow become nearer and dearer than even her'only sister; and whose wishes she desired to consult before carrying out her plans. She knew that he was waiting and watching for her coming, listening for the sound of her light step upon the stair, and her gentle rap at his door; and the thought of that and of the joy her unexpected news would cause him, filled .her mind to the entire exclusion of all sad reflections as she sped gaily onward. Nor was she disappointed in the re- ception of either herself or her tidings: he was filled with joy and with deep thankfulness; to God first, and 'then to her whose love and devotion were shedding such light upon his gloomy pathway,  He entirely approved of her plans; and she set about carrying them through to completion with all speed.  Negotiations for the purchase of the   farm were at once entered into with Mr. Cook, and soon brought to a satis- factory conclusion. Lilian became the owner of the place, possession was to be given the first of March, and Ezra Ward, having been written to, replied that he and Deborah would be there at that time; ready to hear and attend to Lilian's directions concerning the management of her household affairs. They were " full of joy," he wrote, " at the prospect of such a home with one to whom they, were so strongly' at- tached." In the meantime Mr. Dana had come for the answer of Florence to his offer; and it had been announced that he was her accepted lover. Lilian's engagement, too, had been noised abroad, to the great astonish- ment of her'friends and acquaintances; many of whom ventured a remon- strance, telling her that she was much too young and pretty, and engaging thus to throw herself away; making the happiness of another ljy the sacri- fice of her own. But she smilingly replied that she was seeking her own happiness as well as his; and at length she was left to take her own way without let or hin- drance: the gossips contenting them- selves with. sighing over her, shaking their wise heads, and prophesying: that the time would come when she would repent of thus having rejected their advice. CHAPTER VII. M  R. DANA sued for an early mar- riage; but Florence insisted that she could not be ready before spring. "It would take all that time to make the necessary preparations," she said; "and besides, she wished to be married on the same day that Lilian was; and   she would not be ready before the first of June, as her house had to be re- paired, altered and furnished, and the grounds about it put in order; to say nothing of the preparation of her trousseau, which, to be sure, was to be very simple, as was suitable for the mistress of a little farm-house." And Florence had her own way. The first Wednesday in June was the day appointed for the celebration of the double nuptials. Meanwhile she employed herself in the preparation of an elaborate ward- robe, and quantities of table-linen and bedding; trying by incessant occupa- tion to keep out thought; while Lilian taught her little school-giving -every spare moment to Aubrey-until the term was finished, which was about the time that Ezra and his wife arrived. -After that, her attention was divided between the farm-where she was over- seeing the alterations and improve- ments--and her helpless lover; her aunt and Meta having kindly under. taken to do for her what Florence was doing for herself.  It was a beautiful evening in June. Lilian sat alone in her own room, by the window, looking out upon the garden, where Mr. Dana and Florence, arm in arm, were pacing slowly back and forth, their forms now lost in the shadow of the trees and shrubs, now distinctly visible as they emerged into the moonlight that lay in broad patches on the gravelled walks, and flooded the grass plats and flower beds with its silvery radiance. The air was filled with the mingled fragrance of roses, honeysuckle and mignonette, and the subdued sounds that come so softly to the ear on a still summer night in the country-- the slight rustle of the leaves on the trees, the chirping of the cricket, the     distant bay of a dog, and now and then, it may be, the murmur of human voices. All these came to Lilian as she sat there in dreamy silence, thinking of the past, the present, and the future. She felt calmly, serenely happy. All her arrangements had been made-the little home had grown very pretty and' attractive beneath the united exertions of her uncle and aunt, herself and her two willing and deeply interested as- sistants. It made no pretensions to grandeur, but an air of neatness, com- fort, and even elegance pervaded it. She looked forward with eager delight to the pleasure of introducing Aubrey to it; in especial, to the room which was to be particularly appropriated to his use; and on the furnishing and adornment of which she had expended much thought, and much labor; labor made -light and easy by the love that prompted it. Everything was ready, and in two days more she and Florence -were to leave their uncle's house for homes of their own. The old home had been a very happy one, and a slight sigh escaped Lilian as she thought of leaving it; yet not for one instant did she regret her choice, or feel a pang of the repentance Florenfice had prophesied. No, as she herself had skid, her affection for Aubrey was too deep, too strong and true for that; and joy thrilled through every vein as :hope whispered that she could make his life bright and happy with her love and care, in spite of the heavy affliction that Infinite Wisdom had seen fit to send him. But it was growing late; a deeper, stillness was settling down over the village; fewer lights gleamed out from the windows of the neighboring houses; she heard Mr. Dana's good-night to Florence, and the next moment here   sister's arms were clasped about her neck, and she was sobbing on her bosom.     \ "Why, Flo, darling, what is it?" she asked, caressing her tenderly. "Are you not happy now when so near the realization of your fondest wishes?" "No, no!" cried Florence, passion- ately. "Can gold and costly array fill an empty heart? O Lilian, you are all I have left to love, and we must part;" and she wept more bit- terly than before. "You forget him who will soon be your husband, and as such, far nearer and dearer than I," said Lilian, gently, stroking back the hair from her sister's forehead, and kissing her softly. "No, no, I do not, but I hate him, I detest him!" cried Florence, vehe- mently. "I liked him well enough as a friend, but I loathe him as a lover;- I cannot endure his caresses, and he is continually heaping them upon me. Why can't he be distant and polite? For then I might be able to bear it." "O Florence I and will you tie your- self for life to this man, feeling as you say you do?" exclaimed Lilian, with a shudder. / "I have gone too far now to retreat," she answered, with a heavy sigh, "and in fact, I don't wish to; if I were free this minute, I should choose again just as I have done; for wealth and high position have such charms for me that I must and will accept them, now that they are offered, in spite of everything. How you can en- dure the prospect of spending your days in that little farm-house, dividing your time between waiting on a help-' less invalid, overseeing your laborers, and assisting Debby with the house- work, I can't see." Lilian smiled. "Love makes this dull prospect look very bright to me.   But, O Florence, my sister, I fear you are preparing -for yourself a bed of thorns, which will pierce you with keenest pain. Do, I beseech you, draw back even at this eleventh hour." The storm of passion had spent it- self, and Florence was again quiet and collected; wearing the same calm, cold expression of fixed -resolve she had worn, when alone with Lilian, ever ; since the day she had announced her determination to marry Mr. Dana. "Would you have me break my promise?"' she asked, scornfully. "You who pretend to .hold yours as a thing so sacred?" "It would not be necessary; you have but to tell Mr. Dana the whole truth, and, I am sure, he will release ygou at once." "I have already told you that I do not wish to be released," said. Florence, in the same cold tone she had used before. "But if you do not care for yourself, Flo, yet think how you are wronging Mr. Dana," entreated Lilian, laying her hand on her sister's arm. "'Is it right-is it honorable to marry him, feeling as you do?" "I have told him that my preference does not amount to love." "But have you told him that you love another?" "No; nor will I," replied Florence, angrily; "nor has he any right to ask if it be so. Am I his first love? No; nor even the second; if he could have. obtained your hand, he would,never have sought mine." "But he loves you better now than he ever did me," said Lilian, sooth- ingly; for the tone in which Florence's last words were spoken was very bitter. '-It is -easy to see that he is very deeply in love with you now, Flo; and   how can you give so little where you receive so much?" "Love which is so readily trans- ferred from one object to another, I esteem of little worth. And now let us be done with this subject forever; for -as my mind is fully made up-it is exceedingly distasteful to me." How different they were-these two, though one mother bore them, and they had been dandled upon the same father's knee. Lilian said no more at that time; nor did she again allude to the matter; for she saw that it was utterly useless to attempt to dissuade Florence from thus sacrificing herself on the altar of worldly ambition. But many times during the hurry and bustle of pre- paration that filled the house for the next two days, did her heart ache for this dear, only sister, as she noticed her restlessness and the forced gayety of her manner, which could not hide from the keen eye of sisterly affection the wretchedness and despair it was meant to conceal; however much it might deceive Meta and the other merry, thoughtless young girls Flor- ence had selected to be her bridesmaids. She had chosen six: Lilian was to be first, and Meta second, in virtue of their near relationship; the others being merely intimate,friends. They were much with Florence at this time, and evidently looked upon her with something very nearly akin to envy-especially when she displayed to their admiring eyes a splendid; set of diamonds, the bridal gift of her be- trothed; while many were the glances of commiseration bestowed by their upon Lilian; many the pitying words whispered from one to another, as they discussed her future prospects. But they might have changed their minds could they have read the hearts     of the two-could they have seen the emotions swelling in each breast. The wedding morning rose clear and bright: never was a lovelier day; as was repeated again and again by one and another of these gay young crea- tures, as they flitted from room to room in Mr. Lambert's house, assisting in, or admiring the preparations for the coming ceremonial. The marriage of Florence and Mr. Dana was to be the grand affair of the occasion; quite throwing Lilian's into the shade; for though the same day was to witness the espousals of both sisters, they were to take placed at dif- ferent hours. Florence having declared that, though powerless to prevent her sister from throwing herself away on " that miser- able cripple," she could not, and would not see her do it, it had been arranged that she should be married in the morning, and have a grand reception and a wedding dinner; directly after which she, and Mr. Dana would start upon their bridal tour; while Lilian's was to be a quiet wedding later in the day. No one was expected to be pres- ent at the latter ceremony but the family, and a few very intimate friends; such an arrangement according best with Aubrey's wishes; for he shrank from being made a gazing stock to: strangers, or to those who had known him in better days-before this terrible i blight fell upon him. And Lilian, more modest in her de- sires than her sister, had contented f herself with the choice of one brides- I maid; Meta was to serve her also in i that capacity; while Harry Griswold ] had been selected by Aubrey as his j groomsman.             1 Very . fair and beautiful Florence 1 looked when atrayed in her bridal 1 robes; and so well did she conceal her e   e feelings, that none but Lilian guessed that she was other than the happiest I of brides. "'O   my darling, how lovely you a are I I did not know you were half so - beautiful," cried Lilian, clasping her i in her arms. , Florence smiled as proud, gratified, yet sorrowful smile ; and as their eyes met, Lilian's filled with tears. "Don't, Lil," whispered Florence, hurriedly disengaging herself from her sister's affectionate embrace. "Don't, if you love me; for it is too late now, and I must go through with it." Lilian turned away with a heavy sigh, and had much ado to keep down the emotion swelling at her hert. She had scarcely conquered it when the door opened to admit the groom and his attendants; and a moment later they were all on their way to the parlor. Florence felt that the eyes of the whole company were upon her, and exerting all her self-control, she pre- served a calm exterior, showing no sign of emotion throughout the cere- mony; except that at the words, "I pronounce you husband and wife ac- cording to the ordinance of God; what, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder," a deadly paleness overspread her countenance for an instant. But it vanished so quickly that few noticed it; and, she received the greet- ings and kind wishes of her friends with easy and careless grace, smiling, sweetly   and .looking  bewitchingly lovely; while the newly-made husband stood by her side the very picture of pride and delight, as he bowed his acknowledgments for the congratula- tions heaped upon   him, or glanced rapturously at his beautiful young. bride, little guessing the feelings she entertained toward himself.   Lilian felt like' one in a dream as she watched her sister, apparently so bright and happy, and at the same time recalled her wild words spoken only two nights before. "I have played my part well thus far, have I not, Lil?" whispered Flor- ence, as Lilian helped her change her bridal robes for the pretty travelling dress provided for the journey. "I think no one could have suspected that I was not to the full as happy as I ought to be; or as the groom. I wish I did care for him, Lil; for I believe, after all, you were quite right about his devotion to me." "' I am sure of it; and, O Flo, do try to give him the first place in your heart; for he is worthy of it; and you will consult both your duty and your interest in so doing!" said Lilian, earnestly, as she clasped her sister in a fond parting embrace. "Ah, if I could only be as good as you, Lil I But it is quite out of the question," said Florence, between a smile and a sigh, as she returned the caress, and hastily brushing away a' tear, tripped lightly down the stairs.. Friends clustered about her in the hall below, hasty adieux, more merry than gad, smiling good wishes for a prosperous journey and a happy after life, followed each other in quiet suc- cession, and were replied to in the same I light strain; she was handed -to the carriage, and as the groom took his i place by her side, its door closed upon them, and they drove off, leaving the ' gay and festive scene behind them.  The excitement of the wedding was all past, Florence found herself alone i with Mr. Dana, and her heart sank i like lead in her bosom at the thought - that now she was tied to, him for life. A   feeling of invincible repugnance i stole over her * and when he passed his i   arm around her waist, drawing her to his side with a fond whisper, "My wife, my darling!" she' averted her face and shrank from him in a way that spoke her dislike but too plainly He released her instantly; the glad light faded out of his face, and when again he addressed her, it was in a tone of freezing politeness. He did love her, and had painted to himself bright pictures of the happy life she should lead with him, surrounded by every pleasure and luxury that money could command; but, alas, too late he dis- covered the sad, the irretrievable mis- take he had made. Several hours passed by; the guests had withdrawn from Mr. Lambert's house; but a festive air still hung around it. In her own room Lilian sat alone, dressed as a bride, in simple white muslin, but looking most sweet and fair, with- the light of love and joy beaming in her lustrous eyes; yet a shade of sadness now and then swept across her features, as she thought of the helplessness of the arm that Should have been about her now. The door opened, and Meta came in, her fair face very like to an April day in its mingling of smiles and tears. "Darling Lilian!" she whispered, clasping her arms around her cousin. "What shall I do without you? I can hardly bear to think of it." She wiped away a tear; then, as a step was heard on the stairs, "It is Mr. Griswold," she said, hurriedly. '"Everything is ready: he has come, and the minister too." "And I am   ready also, dear," an- swered Lilian, softly, with a blush and a smile, as a knock was heard at the door. Meta opened it to find her father and Mr. Griswold standing there, and as they stepped in the latter offered     his arm; at the same time bowing to Lilian with a glance of undisguised admiration. "They are waiting for us," he said. "Shall we go down, Miss Lambert?  Your father will follow with Miss Duncome." Lilian looked up into the face of her uncle, who was already at her side. It was full of tender regret and sorrow- ful entreaty. "My dear: child," he murmured, as he bent to press a kiss on her fair brow, "are you sure, quite sure, you will not repent? It is not too late to draw back even now." There was not a shadow of regret in the sweet, calm, soulful eyes she lifted to his face, as she placed her hand in his arm and answered, half reproach- fully, "No, dear uncle, my heart goes with my hand; and I have no fear that I shall ever repent of the step I am taking to-day." "God grant you may not 1!" he said; and with a sigh he drew the little hand further into his arm, and led her down into the parlor where Florence lhad that morning spoken the vows against which her heart rebelled, even while they trembled-on her lips. A large easy chair now filled the place where Mr. Dana had then stood, and in it reclined a helpless, motion- less figure, supported on one side by Harry Griswold, on the other by Meta; while around them were grouped the, family, the minister, and the few invited guests. Aubrey's eyes were downcast, and the expression of his face seemed to say that he felt himself an unwelcome i intruder in that house. But Lilian glided to her place at his side, and laid her hand gently upon his, meeting his wistful glance with one so full of self- sacrificing love and tender pity, that I his countenance lighted up with joy. ]   "I cannot see it-I cannot!" mur- Imured Mrs. Lambert in her husband's ear. And she slipped out at the door near which she was standing, that the bride and groom might- not perceive the emotion she felt herself utterly unable to control. The ceremony began at once. There was no faltering in the soft, clear notes of Lilian's voice as she uttered the re- sponses; and a thrill of solemnn glad-. ness seemed to tremble in. Aubrey's full, deep tones. It was over; the deed was done, and they were man and wife. "Hardly a man," sighed Mr. Lam- bert to himself, and he could not speak for emotion as he clasped his niece to his heart, and imprinted a fatherly kiss upon her lips. He could not shake hands with Aubrey, but he gave him a kindly glance-for which the poor fellow felt very grateful-as he stepped aside to make way for other friends to offer their greetings and congratulations. It seemed to Lilian that each one looked into her face as if expecting to read in her eyes some token of regret for the irrevocable step she had taken. But if so, they were disappointed; for there was naught to be found there but love and joy,-a calm, serene, yet half- exultant happiness. Several carriages were in waiting at the door, and shortly after the cere- mony the whole bridal party entered them, and repaired to the home of the newly-married couple. Mr. Dana's wedding gift to Aubrey was a  softly cushioned arm-chair on wheels; so easily moved that Lilian could propel it from place to place, with but a slight exertion of strength. It stood now in the tastefully furnished little sitting-room of the new cottage home, awaiting the coming of its in-   tended- occupant, to whom it was meant 1 to be a pleasant surprise.     t It proved so indeed, as on the arrival ( of the party, he was borne into the house and seated in it. Glad tears shone in Lilian's eyes as I she saw the joy and thankfulness in i his-the gratitude for and delight in : this most welcome and altogether un- expected gift, and the comfort and beauty of the little home, which he found far more attractive than his imagination had painted it. -"You will no longer have to endure i the monotony of constant confinement to one room, Aubrey," remarked Mr. Lambert, showing him how very readily the chair yielded to the slightest effort to move it. "Come, you must now see the whole of this lower floor, and learn what a good and tasteful housewife you have secured in thee person of your bride." He wheeled the chair forward from room to room, Lilian keeping close by its side, and the guests following. All her arrangements were highly commended, and many a compliment paid' to her taste, and good manage- ment. But little she cared for their' admiration of her handiwork, their praises or congratulations. They fell almost unheeded on her ear, so eagerly and intently was she watching the expression of one face, so keenly enjoy- ing the- pleasure she read in it. This exhibition over, the wedding supper was partaken of, and shortly after their friends departed, leaving the two alone; for Deborah- was in the kitchen, and Ezra busied in the care of his cattle. Lilian bade adieu at the gate to her aunt, uncle and Meta, who had lin- gered behind the rest; then returned to the porch, where Aubrey sat looking out upon the little flower garden and 4   the river, separated from it only by the road, which wound along the bantik of the stream. The garden was filled with sweet- scented flowers: honeysuckle, roses, heliotrope, sweethrier and mignonette mingled their aromatic fragrance; the river shone like burnished gold in the rays of the setting sun; the fields and hills beyond were clothed in sunmmer's richest verdure; and over all, the angel of peace seemed brooding; no sound breaking the stillness but the soft ripple of the water, the gentle rustle of the breeze in the tree tops, and the distant bleating of sheep. There was an expression of joy and gladness, of deep, heartfelt gratitude and love, in the face of the still figure that looked out upon this quiet scene; and the eyes he lifted to Lilian's, as she glided to his side, spoke volumes to her heart. "My Lilian, my wife," he whispered, as she bent over him with a half-timid, blushing caress. "My husband," she murmured; "mine, till death do us part." And her arm was clasped about his neck, and her lips touched his cheek. "Ah, Lilian, my Lilian, God has been very gracious to me!" he said. "Truly ' the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage' in ,thee, my well be- loved, my light, my' life, my all of earthly treasurel" CHAPTER   VIII. rTHERE is not often to be met with a more attractive spot than Lakeside Villa and its surroundings, or a more cheerful apartment than its breakfast parlor-spacious,  handsomely  fur- nished, tasteful and elegant in its every     appointment; looking out upon a well- kept lawn and shrubbery, and beyond these to the restless waters of grand old Lake Michigan. Birds were twittering in, the tree tops, the wavelets sparkling in the bright. rays of the morning sun, and a sweet, cool, refreshing breeze, laden with the breath of flowers, came softly in through the open windows, as Mr. Dana entered and sat silently down to his solitary meal. A rich damask cloth of snowy white- ness covered the table; costly china, cut-glass and solid silver ware glittered upon it. A servant stood respectfully -waiting to obey his slightest behest- handed him his morning, paper, and his cup of smoking, fragrant coffee. His steak, omelet and muffins were done to a turn; every luxury was at his command; yet a sigh escaped him as he glanced .toward the empty seat opposite his own. He felt himself, spite of all his wealth and influence, a lonely and unloved man. Ah, what would he not have given for the truly loving, genial companionship: of his beautiful young wife? for even one glance of genuine affection from her bright eyes? Not one such had he received in the months that had passed since he could claim her as his own. Coldness, and an aversion she had scarcely attempted to conceal, had been his only reward for the most persistent and assiduous efforts to win her to contentment and happiness. He was growing hopeless of success, and beginning to yield himself, with a sort -of sad resignation,-to his hapless  fate.  He had been considered a youthful :'looking man for one of his years, but  the. grey hairs were now thickening on his temples, and the furrows   growing deeper day by day upon his brow. He tried to console himself with the news of the day, and by giving. his thoughts more exclusively to business. He finished the paper and his'meal togetheri and with a brief order to the servant to see that his gig was brought to the door within ten minutes, he left the room. Traversing the wide entrance hall of the. mansion, and ascending -the broad staircase, he passed into the suite of apartments appropriated to its mistress. These consisted of a boudoir, and dressing and sleeping rooms, all most luxuriously and elegantly furnished.  The communicating doors stood wide open to admit the air, and with light and cautious tread Mr. Dana passed from. room to room till he found him- self in the presence of his still sleeping wife. Florence was fond of luxury and ease, and nothing could have induced her to forego her morning nap, and share the early breakfast her husband found necessary to enable him to reach his place of business in season. He had never asked her to do so, but would have been' deeply gratified by such an evidence of a desire on her, part to give him pleasure; for, spite of all her coldness and aversion, he was still very fond of her, and his heart yearned. for some small token of' affection, yet hoping against hope that some day he should succeed in winning a place in her regard. He stood there, now, beside her couch, with folded arms, gazing on her with dewy eyes, while his breast heaved and his lip trembled with emotion. She was looking a little pale, and he sighed Ito himself that he feared late hours and the excitement of parties,   concerts, etc., were undermining his darling's health. Ah, if she could but learn to love him so well as to be con- tent with simple home pleasures shared with him! i One hand lay outside the coverlet, and he stooped and softly pressed his lips upon it ere he turned to go; then stole away as quietly as he had come. He had thought her sleeping; but from the instant that his entering foot crossed the threshold, it was but feigned slumber; she heard his sigh, and the touch of his lip upon her hand sent a strange thrill through her whole frame. Florence was not altogether heart- less, and there were times when con- science reproached her bitterly for the great wrong she had been guilty of toward this good, kind, true-hearted man. The boudoir door' closed ,softly be- hind him, and she started up in the bed, bending forward in a listening attitude till the sound of wheels on the gravelled carriage road, leading from the house to the highway, told her that he was gone. She, threw herself back upon her pillows. 'I wish he wouldn't!" she muttered. "Why will he persist in making such a fool of himself when he knows I don't care for him? It's a shame; for it makes me feel so mean. I'd rather, by half, he'd abuse me; for then I 'could treat him to coldness and disdain without any compunction. But, after all, why need H worry myself? I've heard even my excellent sister Lilian assert that love comes of itself, and wont be forced. So I'm not to blame for not loving him. I told him hon- estly I didn't, and if he was particular about it, why did he tempt me with his offer of wealth and position? I'm sure it's hard enough that I couldn't )    have them without giving up the man I did care for. But, pshaw! now I've paid such a price for them, I mean to enjoy them, and not trouble myself with foolish regrets, or-or pity for him. He can't say he got the worst of the bargain; my youth and beauty ought to be considered at least a fair equivalent for all I get from him. And I'm sure I grace the head of his establishment, and entertain his guests in a maniner to gratify his pride. So there! I think we're quits." She rose, threw on a wrapper, and rang for her maid. Florence had a very heavy suit of hair, long and thick, and in her girl-  hood's 'days used to complain very much of the trouble of arranging it for herself, and, laughingly to say, that she meant to marry a man who was rich enough to let her have a lady's- maid to perform that service for her. She had kept her word, and brought one with her from the East, on their return from their bridal tour. The girl answered the bell almost immediately, performed her task with celerity and skill, and asked for further orders. . "Go down and see that they have a nice hot breakfast for me," commanded Florence. "Let them serve it in the breakfast parlor. I shall be there in ten minutes." t"Yes, ma'am," and the maid van- ished. Florence completed her toilette-- simple, but very tasteful and becoming --sighed a little at the thought that there was no one but the servants to admire it, but came down radiant and handsome, ate a hearty breakfast, gave her orders for, the day, took a stroll about the grounds, visited the con- servatory, and gave some directions to the gardener.     Then an hour was spent at the piano, a grand toilette made, and rustling in rich silk, and sparkling with diamonds, she stepped into her handsome car- riage, and ordered her coachman to drive her into town. "To the dressmaker's first, Fenton," she said.' And leaning back upon the softly-cushioned seat, she smiled com- placently to herself at the thought of her luxurious surroundings; and the remembrance of the beautiful face and richly attired figure she had seen a moment before reflected in the tall pier-glass in her dressing-room. "Ah, they may talk as they please of love in a cottage," she murmured, "but the ease and enjoyments of wealth for me, say I. What is Lil doing just now, I wonder?. I wish I could show her my house, my servants, my carriage and handsome match horses (there's not such another pair in the city), and my jewel-case, with its diamonds, pearls, rubies, and. eme- ralds; and. my elegant laces and silks too. I don't see how she could help envying me, and regretting her folly in rejecting Mr. Dana and. marrying that --.   dear, just to think what a life she's settled down to I I'd kill myself if I had to endure it for a i month." Mr. and Mrs. Dana had received cards of invitation to a grand party, which was to come off on the next evening. Florence was going to great expense in her preparations for it, and expected to be the belle of the occasion. There had been a constant round of such entertainments ever since she had made her debut into Chicago society, and in each she had found herself un- mistakably the cynosure of all? eyes. She was greatly admired and courted, and enjoyed the consciousness of it intensely.   It mattered little to her that her husband could not always conceal his jealousy of younger men, or that- though by no' means close-he winced a little under the excessive extrava- gance of her preparations for these ex- hibitions of her personal charms. She spent money without stint upon silks, laces and jewelry, never appearing twice in precisely the same costume. Her mantua-maker was now at work upon a rich pearl-colored silk, to be worn under an overdress of point lace, looped up with diamonds. Florence found it nearly completed. The dress- maker was exceedingly obsequious to the rich and influential customer, re- galed her with much fulsome flattery, waited upon her to her carriage door, and Florence drove away more than ever in love with wealth and posi- tion. The rest of the morning was spent in paying ceremonial calls, and adding to her already great store 'of laces, ribbons, and artificial flowers. It was long past their usual dinner hour when at length the carriage turned into the well-kept, grounds of Lakeside Villa. Its master was on the watch for her coming, and came out to receive her. "My dear," he said, as he politely --handed her out, "dinner has been waiting for more than an hour, and I began to' grow really very uneasy lest you had met with some accident." "What absurd nonsense!" she said, pettishly. "The horses are perfectly safe with Fenton to drive them; and I am quite capable of taking care of myself, as well as- of deciding when I ought to return home." "Regularity in regard to meals is important to health." "That of old people, perhaps; but I am still young and vigorous enough to   feel no inconvenience from an occa- sional irregularity."  "It will tell upon you after a while, if continued; and I feel very uncom- fortable from waiting so long beyond my accustomed hour." "I have never asked you to wait for me, and would greatly prefer that you should not. You can always order your meals served when you choose." "Of course; but I choose to have my wife in her place at the head of the table." Florence swept past him, and as- cended the stairs. His wife! how the words grated on her ear; how in that moment she longed for the freedom of her careless girlhood. And how angry she was at that mild rebuke, that very slight assumption of marital authority. She took her place at the table with a most unbecoming frown on her face, and to all her husband's efforts at con- versation returned only cold mono- syllables, till at length he too relapsed into gloomy silence. With the dessert the servant brought in a note, which he handed to his master. Mr. Dana opened it with a lowering brow. "Yes, just as I thought, cards of invitation to another of those tire- some soirees. I think we have already -had enough to last a lifetime." "Our 'tastes differ most decidedly there. I could attend one or more every night." "I hoped you would be willing to send a regret at least this once. Why, we attended three last week, have averaged about that many ever since we came home, and are already en- gaged to Mrs. Barrington for to- morrow-Tuesday-night. These are for Wednesday." "Well, and what of all that? I can   assure you I have not the faintest idea of sending a regret. They're from Mrs. Lansing, aren't they?" "Yes; a woman I detest and de- spise,--one who will fawn upon and flatter you to your face, while she ridi- cules or slanders you behind your back." "Pooh! half the world does the same. And she gives splendid parties. All the elite of the city will be there. I wouldn't miss it for auything."i "Not even to please your husband, Florence?"' "You once told me that you knew no higher pleasure than my gratifica- tion. But it is easy to talk," sneered the young wife. And with a slight sigh, Mr. Dana resigned himself to his fate. They rose from the table; he took up his newspaper, and Florence retired to her own apartments to while away the remainder of the afternoon between a siesta and the last new novel. Mr. Dana's society was extremely distasteful to her-had grown more and more so ever since their marriage had given him the right to inflict it upon her when and where he would; but in her boudoir she felt compara- tively safe from him. Since the first week after bringing her home, he had not ventured to intrude upon her there. Her manner, when he had done so, having been so cold and repellant as to leave him in no doubt that his visits were unwelcome.  Indeed, he could scarcely shut his eyes to the fact that he was regarded as merely a necessary, and not too agreeable appendage to his wealth and position. Florence met him at tea in appa- rently a far more amiable mood than had possessed her at the dinner table. Her face beamed with smiles: she had dressed to suit his taste, and coming to his side, she laid her hand affection-     -ately on his arm, asking, "How do you ' like my appearance?"        c "You are charming," he answered, I venturing a caress, which she received s with unusual graciousness. Ignorance is sometimes bliss. He did not know, or suspect--what was really the fact-that the discovery that her. purse was nearly empty, and that: she wanted several new additions to her wardrobe in anticipation of Mrs. Lansing's party, had much to do with this sudden amiability. She was lively and chatty through the meal, and immediately after pro- posed a stroll about the grounds, during which, to his great delight, she hung confidingly on his arm, and listened with deep, apparent interest while he learnedly discoursed upon landscape 'gardening and architecture; two hob- bies of his which heretofore she had been wont to treat with supreme in- difference. He began to hope anew that he might yet find in her the sym- pathizing companion and friend--the helpmeet-a man needs to find in the wife of his bosom. He was fond of music, particularly of the piano; and in the days of their courtship had found great enjoyment in hearing Florence play and sing; for she was a highly accomplished musi- cian, and possessed a voice of unusual compass and sweetness. But since their marriage he had rarely heard her except in public. She was ready enough to exert herself and display her talents for the entertainment of the crowds of strangers, or mere ac- quaintances, at a party or soiree, but when alone with him had always some excuse at hand. \ This evening, however, finding her in so amiable a mood, he ventured to ask for a favorite song. His request was at. once complied with; she sat   down to the piano, and gave him not only that, but all his other favorites. It was the happiest evening he had spent since the one that preceded their nuptials.       ,  Florence had intended to prefer her request that night, but somehow could not find the courage. She determined upon first making another effort for his gratification. The next morning she surprised him with her company. at the breakfast table, showing him a bright face, neatly arranged hair, and a tasteful morning dress. His delight fully equalled her ex- pQctation, and on the strength of it she ventured to ask that her purse might be refilled. He- leas evidently both amazed and displeased. ' ( It i s hardly ten days since I gave you two hundred dollars, Florence," he said; "sand .I certainly expected it to last at least a month. You are growing very extravagant. I paid five hundred for you last month: and that in addition to over two thousand spent on your wardrobe, during our stay in New York." "Well, and what if you did? I presume I am worth that, and more too," she answered, with an indignant toss of her head. "If I'd supposed you were going to growl and grumble every time I asked for a little money, rI would never have married you." r A little, Florence? Do you call three thousand dollars, in as many months, a little?" "t  It's a mere trifle for as rich a man as you." "I am rich, it is true, but my ex. r penses are very heavy; money melts ) away wonderfully fast; and I have t not the purse of Fortunatus; there is a t limit to my means." !   "Well, am I to understand from all that tirade, that you refuse my very reasonable request?" They had finished their meal, and the servant had left the room before this talk began. Florence was leaning back in an easy chair, with her hands folded in her lap, and as she 'spoke the last words, she flashed a look of scorn and defiance at her husband, out of her great black eyes. He gave her a glance of grieved dis- pleasure ii return, took out his pocket- book, laid a roll of bank notes in her lap, and silently left the room. She took them up and counted them over. "Two hundred again. Well, he might have done worse; he's not so bad after all. I wish I hadn't looked quite so fierce at him. But there, I shan't worry! What's the use? And I'ml sure I was lovely to him all last evening; and 'twould be hard enough if I couldn't have all' I want that money will buy, after resigning poor, dear Harry for him. Heigh ho! it was a hard choice, I'm sure; but what's done can't be undone. Now, I'll drive into town and buy that love of a sash, and a dress for Mrs. Lansing's party. It' is nice to be rich-drive about in one's own carriage, and wear loads of fine things. But, dear me, I'd no idea how much a woman might spend, and yet not 'have all she'd like to." Mr. Dana's gig was driving along the road that, skirting the lake shore, led from his country-seat to the city. He was repairing 'to his place of busi- ness with a heavy heart. He under- stood now the secret motive that had prompted his wife's conciliatory and seemingly affectionate behavior of the night before, and her effort to give him pleasure that morning. "Not   love for me, but for the contents of my purse," he sighed, bitterly. "O Flor- ence! Ah, what an old fool I have been!" CHAPTER   IX. TILIAN sat by her husband's side diligently plying her needle, while he read aloud to her.. They were on the front porch, now converted into a perfect bower by the rapid growth, under her fostering care, of morning glories and mountain fringe. - The little garden was still gay with flowers, showing patches of white, pink, purple, scarlet, gold and blue; while the oaks and maples that shaded the road and the river bank, had been here and there just lightly brushed by the Frost king's pencil, and grown' gorgeous be- neath the6 touch. It was a bright, warm morning in the latter part of September, a golden haze filled the air, the river rippled gently by, now in the shadow of the trees, now sparkling in' the sunlight, while a cool, refreshing breeze came from it, gathering sweet- ness from the garden as it passed. "How you are working," said Aubrey, pausing in his reading, and turning a loving look upon his wife. "Your needle moves with wonderful celerity. What need of such' haste? Let me counsel more moderation. I fear you will tire yourself out." "I am expecting Ezra every mo- ment, and trying to get this garment done before he comes; that I may have full leisure to examine what I hope he may bring from the post office," she answered, looking up with a sunny smile. "I believe I am far more anxious and excited than you. I'm sewing on the .last button. There, it is done. And just in time; for yonder colleS Ezra."     Lilian sprang up, folded the com- pleted garment, laid it in her work basket, and ran down to the gate, at which Ezra Ward, at the same moment, brought their little farm wagon to a halt. "Quite a mail for you to-day, Mrs. Falconer," he' said, handing her several letters and newspapers, and a maga- zine; "so I guess you'll not scold me for bein' a leetle behind time. You see --" "Yes, yes, all right, Ezra. I accept your excuses without hearing them,' she answered, gayly, as she turned and xan back to the house, displaying her ,treasureS. "A letter from your sister, and one from mine, beside two others; but ,they'll keep for a little, while we ex- amine these. Yes, yes, here it is: 'We publish in this number "A Barrister's First Case;" a capital story by a new -contributor, from whom we hope to ,hear again,'" "My dear husband, I congratulate you onI your success." She dropped the magazine to throw her arm about his neck and kiss him, with tears of joy and wifely pride shining in her eyes. "A  success largely due to your loving sympathy and help, darling." "They could not supply the talent; and, all, dearest, it' is so sweet a privi- lege to be companion, friend, and help- meet to y6u. Now, let us see if your short article has met with as happy a fate," she added, taking up one of the newspapers, and glancing rapidly over it. "Yes, here it is in a conspicuous place on the first page. O Aubreyj I feel like jumping up and down, and clapping my hands as I used to do -when five or six years old, or there- abouts. But these letters. I dare say now they're from the editors. Will you hear them first?"   He assented, and she read them witlh increasing joy and exultation. They spoke in flattering terms of the contributed articles, asked for more, and hinted at thedesire for a perma- nent arrangement with the author, if his future efforts should be found to excel, or even to -equal these. The editor of the magazine also enclosed a check for fifty dollars, in payment for the accepted and published story. As Lilian held it up before his eyes, Aubrey was for a moment too much overcome to speak. "Ah," he murmured, at length, "I am then no longer utterly useless! Can it be possible that God--in his great and undeserved goodness to such a rebellious wretch as I have been-is going to permit me to be your pro- vider, my darling, if not the protector I long to be?" "He will ever be that to us both," she whispered, laying her head for an instant on his shoulder, while she looked lip into his face with glistening eyes. "And, ah, what gratitude we owe for your spared intellect I "But I am neglecting our sisters' letters shamefully. Here is Adah's. It is in answer to the one you wrote yourself, with your pen between your teeth. She appreciates the effort it cost you," she added, glancing over, and then beginning to read it aloud to him. "Poor dear I " he sighed, as she con- eluded. "It is very evident to me that, though she tries to write cheerfully, she still finds but little brightness in her life." "We will hope for better days for her, too," said Lilian. -"How she will rejoice in your success. I'm sure it cannot fail, to throw at least a gleam of sunshine on her pathway. How she thanks me for devoting myself to- you.   Ah, she does not seem to understand that I was seeking my own happiness as well as yours. I suppose because she finds so little to love in her hus- band. "Ah, my Aubrey, it is not so much the body, as the soul, the intellect, and the character, that make the man or woman; and it is these in you that I love so very dearly, while, as the casket that holds them, the body too is precious." His answering look spoke volumes of love land gratitude. "All you say makes my success seem doubly and trebly delightful. And now, are you not going to let me hear what Florence says?" "Yes, certainly; a pleasure un- shared with you would hardly be one." Florence's letter was dated the day after Mrs. Lansing's party, and written in a fit of anger at her husband. She called him "an. old tyrant," but de- clared her determination to "let him see that she was her own mistress, and not to be ruled by him." We will, however, try to give a more impartial version of the story than hers. We left Mr. Dana driving into town on Tuesday morning. Mrs. Barring- ton's party was to come off that even- ing, Mrs. Lansing's the next. Mr. Dana had a slight headache, which steadily increased during the day. At dinner he spoke of it to his wife, adding that he should be glad to stay at home, and retire early that night. Florence looked annoyed. "A nap this afternoon will probably relieve you," she said, coldly; "but even if it does not, I can't see that so trifling an ailment need keep you at homIne." "I should certainly be very sorry to deprive you of your anticipated pleas- ure,'" he said.   "Indeed!" she cried, indignantly, "you surely can't suppose that I am going to stay at home, if you do. What! miss the party after all the trouble and expense I've been at to get ready for it? I couldn't think of such a thing. My dress has just come home, and is the loveliest and most becoming that I ever had on." "It will keep for another occasion." "Indeed, I intend to wear it to- night." "Have you really so little affectioni for me, Florence, that you would-for the mere gratification of your own vanity and love of display-drag me inlto society when I am too ill to enjoy it?" "Ill? If I were a man, I'd be ashamed to make such a fuss about an ordinary attack of headache. But I have no desire to drag you out; I should quite as lief go without you. Being a married lady, I need no chape- rone, and if I desire company, our next neighbor, Mrs. Willis, will, no doubt, be glad to take a seat in llmy carriage, as they keep none of their own." "Mrs. Willis is welcome to ride with us; but if you go, Florence, I go with you," he answered, with dignity. "Then you may as well make up your mind to go; for I give you fair warning, -that stay at home I wont." Her tone was defiant, and he rose and-left the table in stern displeasure. Anger and excitement increased his indisposition, and rendered it utterly impossible to follow his wife's prescrip- tion. For an hour he walked his study floor, with bowed head and folded arms, his heart swelling with better thoughts, and unavailing regrets. But gradually tenderness, pity, and love took the place of anger and indig nation. He said to himself, "Ah, she     is so young, and has none of the wifely affection for her old husband that would make it easy and pleasant to submit to his control, or to deny her- self for his sake. I did wrong to urge her to take me, and ought to be very patient and forbearing with her now. The young dearly love excitement and pleasure, and it would doubtless be a real trial to her to miss this entertain- ment. So, for her sake, I will try to go. As to allowing her to go alone, I cannot think of it." Under the influence of these better feelings, his manner was very kindly when they met at tea. Florence had come down in a wilful mood, but it melted away beneath his genial words and tones. "You seem. very cheerful," she re- marked. "Your head is better,'I hope." "Not very much; but, as you say, a headache is, after all, a mere trifle. I shall go with you to the soiree." "Thank you. I shall not fail to be ready in good season." This was said very graciously, and meant to be a great concession. Mr. Dana was the soul of punctuality, and liked always to be among the early arrivals; while Florence much pre- ferred being fashionably late. She was not ready in good season to- night her maid was slow and awkward in arranging her hair, and the dress was found to need a slight alteration. Mr. Dana unfortunately grew impa- tient, and. twice sent to hurry her movements. In consequence she came down in a pet, and scarcely opened her lips to him during the ride to Mrs. Barrington's. Arrived there, however, her ill humor seemed to vanish as if by magic. She came to him from the dressing- room, looking radiantly lovely, and with her on his arm he made his way   into the crowded parlors, and to the side of the lady of the house, feeling proudly conscious that his wife was the most beautiful, as well as richly attired woman there. Florence dropped his arm and began a lively chat with a gentleman on her other side. Presently the latter led her to the piano, a crowd gathered around, and her husband's presence, nay his very existence was ignored for the rest of the evening. He was scarcely able to get near her. This displeased him; and he grew quite indignant when he saw a hand- some young gentleman, an entire stranger to him, conducting Florence to the supper table; for he was so old- fashioned in his notions as to be of the opinion that the properest person to wait upon any,lady was her own hus- band. A short colloquy he overheard at the same time was hardly calculated to pour oil upon the troubled waters of his mind. A gentleman asked of the lady on his arm, "Who is that dashing young belle?"  "Young belle?" laughed his com- panion. "She's a married woman." "You don't say so! And pray who is the fortunate man who has secured such a prize?" "Mr. Dana: the gentleman with whom she entered the room." "What, that old man? I thought he. was her father, of course." Mr. Dana left the festive scene in anything but a good humor with his wife. He read her a lecture, on the way home, which she did not take in good part. She would scarcely speak to him all the next day, and, partly by way of retaliation, went into town and ran up large bills at several of the dry goods and jewelry stores. o   Disturbance of mind, joined to his slight illness, had kept him awake the greater part of the night; he was more than ever disinclined for party going, and again proposed sending Mrs. Lan- sing a regret. But Florence would not hear of being kept at home; she declared that nothing would induce her to consent to miss that particular soiree, and finally he yielded to her Wish, and went. If he expected any gratitude for this concession, he was sorely disappointed. She behaved worse than ever, carrying on a decided flirtation with the-same gentleman who had paid her such marked attention the previous evening. Mr. Dana bottled up his wrath for that night, but it boiled over the next day when the merchants sent in their bills, and Florence met him at the dinner table with cards of invitation to still another soiree. Sharp and bitter words passed be- tween them. He foibade her to make any more purchases for which she did not pay the ready money, said he would not furnish her with another cent for a month, and told her she should not accept this new invitation; she "had already disgraced herself and him by her shameless flirtations, and should not very soon have an opportunity to repeat them." At these words Florence rose from the table almost white with passion. "Though so unfortunate as to have committed the mad folly of becoming your wedded wife, I'll show you that I'm not your slave, sir," she said, in a tone of concentrated fury; then flew up to her boudoir, locked herself in, shed a flood of angry tears, and finally poured out her indignation in a letter 'to her sister. In the first half of this epistle- which covered several sheets of large t.       I   sized note paper-she abused Mr. Dana roundly, and bewailed herself as the most unhappy woman in existence; in the second she gave a glowing descrip- tion of her home and its surroundings, of the extent of her wardrobe, the grandeur of her equipage, and all the delights that wealth had brought her; winding up with an urgent invitation to Lilian to pay her a visit. "Aubrey can surely spare you for a few days," she said; " and I want you to come soon, that you may visit us here, and see what a lovely spot this is. The woods will be in all their glory next month, and after that we shall be in town for the fall and winter." Lilian's bright face had grown sad and troubled while she read, and she sighed as she refolded the letter and returned it to its envelope. "Poor, dear Flo!" she said, softly. "Ah, I well knew that a union without love could never bring true happi- ness!" "She did not then love Mr. Dana?" Lilian shook her head. "She loved his wealth and position. But he is so truly good and noble, that I hope she will yet learn to love him for himself." "She seems in pressing need of a wise counsellor and friend. Don't you think it is your duty to accept her in- vitation, and go to her for a few days?" "Do you think you could spare me?" "It would be like sparing the sun out of my sky; like doing without the better half of myself, dearest; but- Florence has a sister's claim upon you." "And you a husband's; and tenfold stronger than that of ordinary men upon their wives. No, Aubrey, it must be a far more pressing call that shall take me for a single day from your side. It is here, here only, that I find     it my duty, my pleasure, my great, great joy to stay. So' entreat me not to leave thee,' my own beloved hus. band," she added, laying her head for an instant on his shoulder, her soft, white hand upon his helpless ones, and lifting her dewy eyes to his, with an expression of unutterable love and ten- derness. "I will write to Florence, and ask her to come for a little while to us, if Mr. Dana can spare her," she added, after a moment's silence. "Ah, yes, that will be better," he said, suppressing the sigh that rose to his lips at the thought of dispensing, for even that short period, with the exquisite enjoyment- of having his sweet wife all to himself. When Florence thought of her sister, it was always with an emotion of pity for her hard lot.  But Lilian. was much the happier of the two. Flor- ence lived 'for self; Lilian for others; and in especial for one far dearer than self. It was an unspeakable joy to her to know how necessary and how pre. cious she was to the husband of her choice; to hear him say that she was more to him than all he had lost; and that if perfect health and vigor might be purchased by the sacrifice of her dear companionship, and by that alone, he should consider the price far too great to pay. He had still times of sad depression, but they were growing less and less frequent. Perhaps the heaviest part of his burden had been the thought of his utter uselessness; but now that seemed to be passing away. They were prospering. Ezra was proving ,himself a good, practical farmer, yet willing to receive sugges- tions gleaned by Aubrey and Lilian, fromn agricultural works which they studied together. Deborah was quite as capable in her line, and very willing,   strong and healthy; she made nothing of the housework for so small a family; nor did she need any oversight; so that Lilian was left free to devote herself almost exclusively to her husband. His comfort and happiness were her constant care; it was her delight to wait upon him, and to feel that he looked to her for all his enjoyments; she attended to all his wants, fed him with her own hands, wheeled him about the house and garden, acted as his amanuensis, and did for him all that his helpless hands and feet refused to do. It was to her-to them   both-a source of never-ceasing joy and thank- fulness that his intellect was unim- paired. She read the newspapers to him  daily; they enjoyed books and periodicals together, and were never at a loss for subjects of thought and con- versation. She encouraged and as- sisted him in an attempt at authorship, in which, as we have seen, his prospects of success were already most flattering. --30 CHAPTER X. IT was a wild, blustery afternoon in March. All day long the wind had blown a gale from  the northeast, vessels were wrecked by it within sight of land, the waves sent foaming and raging hither and thither, and dashing high up on the shore; it swept the streets with a perfect avalanche of rain and sleet, roared in the chimneys, and howled round the corners. Never was a more dismal day, or one fraught with such intense suffering to' Florence Dana, or such mental distress and anxiety to her husband.  For many hours her life had been trem- bling in the balance. There-had been a consultation of the most eminent   practitioners of the city; they gave small hope of her life, and for the last hour the almost distracted husband had paced his study floor to and fro with agitated step, and a face full of remorse and anguish. He had meant to be kind  to the young creature, whose happiness he had taken into his keeping; he had endeavored to be so, but her wilfulness and perversity had sorely tried his patience. His conscience told him that hle had sometimes been harsh with her, memory tortured him with the remem- brance of many a bitter word of up- braiding he had addressed to her. Alas, should she die now, how could he ever forgive himself? Could he but keep her with him, how gentle, tender, and forbearing would he be. It was growing dark, and how dis- mal sounded the roar of the distant waves, the shrieking of the wind, and the dashing of the rain and sleet against the window pane, as he drew near and looked out,ppon the storm- sw ept and almost deserted streets. He turned away with a shiver and a groan, and continued his melancholy prome- nade. His fire was dying out, and dusky shadows filled the room; but he would not ring for lights or fresh fuel, lest he should disturb her. But there came a slight tap at his door, and he made haste to open it. He recognized the form of his family physician standing on the threshold, but it was too dark to see the expres- sion of his face. "Mr. Dana, sir, I come to tell you it is over at last; well over," he has- tened to add, as the terrified husband staggered back and caught at a chair for support. "Thank God! then she will live?" "She is not safe yet, but we have now strong hope of her. And-allow   me the pleasure of congratulating you on being the father of as fine a little fellow as I ever saw of his age. Hark I you may hear his voice above the war of the elements." "Yes, thank you, I am glad-very glad; but-I can hardly think of any- thing but her at this moment. Go back to her, I beg of you, doctor, and don't leave her till all danger is past. Only save her, and you may charge what you will for your time and trou- ble." The physician bowed and withdrew. An hour later he returned to report that his patient was sleeping quietly. "Might I see her?" asked Mr. Dana, tremulously. The doctor demurred at first, but finally gave consent. "If you will take but a peep at her," he said, "and come away again w(ith- out making the slightest noise. I would not have her roused for any- thing; it might cost her life." "I will make no more noise than a mouse; and shall not stay a moment." He stole in on tip-toe, took one glance at the still, white face on the pillow, and silently withdrew, almost overcome at the sight of its death-like pallor. "Doctor," he whispered, grasping the arm of the physician, in great agitation, "do you think she will live? I could not see that she breathed at all." "She's very much exhausted, but I do not despair of her by any means," answered the other, cheerfully. "But you must keep out of her room now, for a few days. She'll not be fit to talk, or be talked to; and mustn't have the least approach to excitement." "That's a hard mandate, doctor; but, of course, your orders must be obeyed."     "Well, sir, there is consolation for I you," remarked the doctor, pointing, r with a smile, to the little one lying on the lap of its nurse.  "It is a fine child," said the de-  lighted father, bending over it, then  taking it in his arms, and gently touch- ( ing his lips to its velvet cheek. "You are not new at -the business, I I see." And the doctor smiled again, ( and drawing near closely scrutinized I the tiny features.      - "No, I have seen the grave close 1 over three. God grant I may be more  fortunate with this! You don't see I anything amiss with it, doctor?"  "No, not at all; there is no deform- ity, and le looks plump and healthy. I hope he may live to make his parents  proud of him." "Thank you." Mr.-Dana's heart swelled with joy and gratitude as he held his uncon- scious treasure to his breast. Henceforth, while this child was spared to him, there was a well-spring of joy in his house; even though the mother of his boy should continue to turn coldly away from the love and tenderness he longed to lavish upon her. How much that thought helped him to endure his term of banishment from her presence, none knew but himself. Still it was very trying,- and he eagerly caught at the first intimation that the time had arrived when the interdict might safely be removed. He found her still with blanched cheeks, and almost colorless lips; but her babe lay on her arm, and she was gazing at it with an expression that made her more beautiful than ever in his eyes. She turned her head at the sound of'his approach, smiled, and said, low and feebly, "Isn't he a darling?" "Indeed he is-my boy--pur boy.   Ah,- Florence, my little wife, you were never so dear to me as at this moment!" He ventured to kiss her thin cheek, and was overjoyed that she did not re- pulse him; for she usually shrank in evident disgust from his slightest caress. "My dear, I have not been quite the husband I meant to be to you; I have often treated you with :positive unkind- ness; and I cannot tell you how pain- ful was -the thought of that-how torturing the remembrance of every harsh word you have heard from my lips, when--when I feared I was about to lose you." "Oh, hush!" she murmured, a crim- son flood dyeing her pale cheek for an instant. "You were an angel compared to me. I've been enough to try the patience of a saint.' The words sent a thrill of gladness to his heart. He had not expected such an acknowledgment from her, and thought it augured well for the future. "Then, darling," he whispered, re- peating his caress, "we will agree to forget the past, and to strive hencefor- ward to live in mutual love and peace. Think how important for the well- being and happiness of our child that we should." "Yes; poor little man! he doesn't know what a miserable sort of mother he has got," she said, between a smile and a sigh, as again her eyes rested upon the tiny face pith an expression of tender, yearning, maternal love. "But a good father will go far to make up the deficiencies of the other parent," she added, with a curious mixture of pleasure and sadness in her I tone, and in the look she turned upon her husband. "No, wife; no, my Florry. You are going to prove yourself one of the very   blst, I trust. But I must bid you good-bye now, or the doctor will scold; and, perhaps, shut me out from your presence for another week." "No, your visit has done me no harm. Indeed, quite the contrary, since I have freed my mind and con- science," she added, with a touch of the gayety of her healthful days. "I declare I feel very much like a child that has been kissed and forgiven after being for ever so long in disgrace." How pleased he was! More in love than when first he wooed and won his beautiful young bride. He could scarcely tear himself away; but when he did, he went to his office with a lighter heart than he had carried in his bosom for many a long and weary day. One bright June morning found Lilian Falconer in a flutter of joyous expectation. Aubrey watched her with loving eyes as she flitted hither and thither-now in parlor or sitting- room busied with broom or duster, now in the garden gathering fresh flowers for her vases, and anon arrang- ing them with tasteful, skilful fingers at the little table by his side. "You look very happy, my little wife," he said, smiling up at her. "And so I am," she answered, gayly. "Who has a better right? Am I not about to have a visit from Flo-my own and only darling, beautiful sister? from my unknown nephew too; and my good brother-in-law? I beg his pardon for putting the younger gentle- man first, but I really, couldn't help it. And, best of all, am I not the wife of one who is destined to stand foremost among American authors?  Ah, I expect, one of these days, to shine brightly by your reflected light, my honored spouse!" "I don't know; I'm very doubtful   about the success of that last article," he answered, with a dubious shake of the head. "What! after your critic has pro- nounced so favorably upon it? You astonish me, Mr. Falconer. I thought you had more confidence in her judg- ment." "Ah, I fear her partiality for the author can hardly leave her judgment unbiassed. Love is apt to see through rose-colored spectacles, you know." "Very well, sir, granting-just for argument's sake-that that may be so, and that the article in question may be so unfortunate as to meet with a re- jection; or, if published, to be torn to pieces, by the critics of the press, or- worse still-let alone severely, what- then? You have met with very con- siderable success in the past, and shall, I doubt not, with much greater in the future. I am perfectly certain that the book is destined to create a sensation, and make the author's fame world- wide, or nearly so." "If the world could be persuaded to see through your spectacles, little wife. You are always so hopeful; but as for me-I have my fits of despondency, when everything looks dark; when all that I have written disgusts me so thoroughly, that I am ready to bid you commit every scrap of it to the flames." "Don't," she said, with a look half- pitying, half-playful; "for I should certainly rise in rebellion against your marital authority." "Ah, but did you not promise to obey?" "True; and I will when your orders are those of a sane and reasonable man; but if you tell me to do so crazy a thing as that, I shall say to myself, "No, I shall not; for if I did, to- morrow he would grieve over his loss,     and tell me he wished I had not been so obedient.' "There, what do you think of my handiwork?" And she held up her newly-filled vases for his inspection. "They are very artistically arranged. You have a great deal of taste, my dear." "In literature, as well as in the blending of colors, please to take no- tice and remember,' she answered, in a lively tone, as she turned and tripped away to the parlor to adorn its mantle and centre table. She was at his side again in a mo- ment. She saw that he was suffering from excessive weariness of body and consequent great depression of spirits. At times the hopeless longing for the power of motion was well nigh unen- durable. She could have wept over him in her'intense love and pity; but instead she spoke cheerfully and even gayly. "You have not had your airing: in ,my unusual press of business, I have neglected you. But you shall have it now. A great many new roses and other flowers have 'broke out' this morning--as a servant girl at Uncle Lambert's used to say-and I want to show them to you." She wheeled his chair into the gar- den as she spoke. "But you have not completed your preparations for the reception of: your expected guests?" he said. "So nearly, that it will not matter if they should go no farther; And you are my first charge. See, is not that rose-bush worth looking at?" "It is, indeed. I never saw a hand- somer one: it is so full, and the shades , of color are so rich." "And their fragrance equals their beauty."   She gathered one, let him smell it, then fastened it in' his button-hole. She took him into every nook and corner of her garden, calling his atten-  tion to all that was new or beautiful, and striving with many a merry jest, many a look or word of tender, wifely affection, to win him from his sadness, and make him forget its cause: At length she was rewarded by see- ing the cloud lifted from his brow, while he talked and laughed with his wonted cheerfulness; for these fits of depression were only occasional. "Come, my dear," he said, at length. "you had better take me back to the porch. I think they will be here before 'long." "Yes, the train will be due at Chil- ford in a very few moments, I think; and Ezra has gone in to meet them. I presume Mr. Dana will hire a hack there-Florence would hardly deign to ride in our little wagon-but it will bring the trunks very nicely." "There is a carriage coming down the road now," he said, as she wheeled his chair into its accustomed place. - "Isn't it rather later than you sup- posed?" "Yes, yes, it must be, for it is our party, sure enough I Have you all you want, dear?" "Yes, wife; run to meet them." She obeyed in eager haste; for. the carriage was already at the gate. In another moment the sisters were locked in a loving embrace. They had not met since their bridal day. Mr. Dana next claimed Lilian's attention, grasping her hand with brotherly warmth, and even venturing to touch his lips to her blooming cheek. She did'not shrink from, or repulse him, but receiving the caress with a light laugh, turned eagerly to take the babe from its nurse.   "Go speak to Aubrey, wont you? and make yourselves perfectly at home," she said to her brother and sister, then ran' swiftly to the house with the little one in her arms. She could think of nothing else at that moment. She carried it to her room, and sit- ting down. clasped it to her bosom, alternately covering its face with kisses, and gazing on it with an expression of mingled love and sadness. She was passionately fond of children, and this one was nearer to her than any she had ever held in her arms before. "You darling, you precious petl" she murmured, and Florence, coming in, found her dropping tears over its face. "What! crying over my baby, Lil?" she said, half wonderingly, and with a touch of raillery in her tone. "I de- clare I believe you care more for him than for his mother." "Ah, Flo, how rich you are! How happy you ought to be!" sighed Lilian, with a yearning look at the sweet baby face, and again tenderly caressing the little creature. ," Ah, well, I'm glad that you've be- come sensible of it at last," laughed Florence, wilfully misunderstanding her. "But just wait till you've seen my diamonds and laces, silks, satins, and velvets; carriages, horses, and ser- vants; town-house and country-seat; and then,remember that you might have been in my place if you would; and that I did all I could to persuade you to take Mr. Dana. And really, Lil, I've often wished from the bottom of my heart that you had. You would have- been worthy of him, while he's far too good for me." "O iFlorry, how can you rattle on in that style? I envy you nothing but this darling, and I have never for one 5   moment repented of my choice; my husband is more, and dearer to me than all the world beside. But can it be possible that you have lived with yours all this time without learning to love him?" "I've tried, Lil, I really have," re- plied Florence, seating herself, and tossing her bonnet on to the bed. "So I'm sure I'm not to blame if I can't manage it; but the fact is, we're not the least bit congenial; there are no two subjects we think and feel alike upon, and if I should outlive him, ag, in the course of nature, I may hope -to do, I'm afraid I shall be a-not very disconsolate widow." Lilian looked, as she felt, positively shocked at her sister's. words. Florence laughed again. "What a face, Lill Do you sup- pose I liave any notion of drugging his tea, or even of worrying him to death, or trying for a divorce? Never a bit. I'm vastly too virtuous for any one of the three; but I'm also too honest and outspoken to conceal-from   you at least--the fact that we are wofully mismated." Lilian sighed. "Ah, Flo, Flo, how you are casting away your own happiness, as well as his. How I pity you both, when I think of the contrast between your lives and ours. Aubrey and I do so revel in our mutual love and sympa- thy." "It's a mystery I despair of ever being able to unravel; such a union would be a living death to me. What a delicious chair this is, Lil. But aren't you tired of that child? of hold- ing  him, I  mean? I'll call the nurse." "No, no, let me keep him a little longer, the darling! I must show him to Aubrey. But first let me conduct     you to your room. What a neglectful hostess I am." "Nonsense, Lil; don't make a stranger of me. Just tell me which it is, and I'll find it for myself," answered Mrs. Dana, picking up her bonnet and following her sister. "Very well then, you may if you choose. I've nothing to exhibit, as you went over the whole house and saw everything in it just before our marriage. You know'where the com- pany room is, and that's to be yours now, of course. I'll return little Lucian presently. I like the name, Florence." "Yes; it was my choice. Mr. Dana was good enough to let me have my own way about it." Lilian found Mr. Dana seated near Aubrey's easy chair, and carrying on an animated conversation with him. They paused as. she drew near. The older gentleman sprang up and gal- lantly placed a chair for her on Aubrey's other side. "Well, what do you think of the boy?" he asked, looking at the babe with a proud, fatherly smile. "Ah, he's charming.  Isn't he, Aubrey?" she cried, holding him up to her husband's view. "Such a dar- ling, such a pet I Did you ever see a sweeter, or prettier baby?" "Never," he answered, gazing upon it with a wistful, longing look. How glad he would have been to be able to take it, for a moment, into his arms. How difficult, nay impossible it was to put aside entirely a feeling of envy, as he watched the quick, active movements of hia brother-in-law, who standing by Lilian's side, now took the babe from her, fondled it and tossed it up and down till it laughed and :cooed in its sweet baby way. The Danas stayed but a few days, being on their way eastward to visit   his parents; intending afterward to spend some time at the sea-shore, and at differed watering places. While Florence stayed, the sisters were together almost constantly, and it pained Lilian to discover how far apart they had drifted in this one year of separation. As regarded the inner life they had little in common. Lil- ian's heart and mind had been expand- ing in the daily and hourly intercourse with good and instructive books, and with a man of highly-cultivated mind and keen intellect; while with Flor- ence incessant devotion to fashion and display, fostering vanity and selfish- ness, had had directly the opposite effect. In vain Lilian tried to influence her to better things. The birth of her child had seemed for a time to make her more thoughtful, more content with quiet home pleasures, and more considerate and affectionate toward her husband; but now she declared she was insufferably weary of the sameness of her existence, and longing to "get back into society." It was with a sad heart Lilian saw her go away; but for Aubrey's sake she quickly shook off her depression, and was again the gay, cheerful little wife, the indefatigable helper and com- forter, he had found her from the first. Years passed ere the sisters met again; for, though scarcely a day's journey apart, the one would not leave her helpless charge, and the other- engaged in Wconstant round of gaye- -ties, spending her winters in giving and attending grand parties, and ex- changing ceremonial calls, her sum- mers in the same sort of butterfly ex- istence at fashionable watering places, or in travelling for pleasure-deferred , from month to month, and from year ; to year, the somewhat distasteful task   of paying a visit to "that poor little farm-house where Lilian had chosen to bury herself." There was, however, a frequent ex- change of letters, and at length Flor- ence engaged to spend two or three weeks at the farm, on condition that Lilian would, immediately after, pay a visit of as many days to Lakeside. This was early in October, shortly after Mrs. Dana's return from her summer tour. She brought with her her two children-Lucian, now a fine boy of seven, and his sister Millicent, a sweet little girl of four-also a nurse- maid to dress and wait upon them; for she was much too fine a lady to think of doing anything of the kind herself. The children seemed charmed with their aunt from the first, but looked with a kind of wondering awe upon the still figure in the chair by her side. "What is that, Aunt Lily?" whis- pered the little girl, reaching up to put her arm round Lilian's neck, and her lips close to her ear. "Do it stay there all the time?" "Hush, hush, Milly;" said her brother, in a low, shocked tone; " it's Uncle Aubrey, poor Uncle Aubrey that mamma told us about; don't you remember?"     , "Yes, it's Uncle Aubrey," said he, with gentle sadness in look and voice. "'Wont you give him  a kiss, little maid? Let Aunt Lilian lift you up; for poor uncle can't lean down to you." The child shrank timidly back, but Lucian stepped forward, saying, "I will, uncle; I am so sorry for you, and I mean to love you very much." "Dear boy, you have won my heart already," answered Mr. Falconer, in a moved tone, as the little fellow gave the offered caress, then stood by his side,   with a hand laid lovingly on his shoulder. "Papa told me you were very good and kind," said Lucian, "and a great author too. I didn't know what that meant till papa explained that it was one who wrote books. Papa has read me one of your books, and I like it ever so much." Seeing her brother's familiarity with the strangely quiet man, Millicent took courage to approach him also. "Milly will kiss him, if he wants her to," she said to Lilian, and allowed herself to be lifted up to do so. They had arrived very early in the morning, before Aubrey had left his room; and coming down, after being washed and dressed, had found him and their aunt upon the porch. Their mamma now made her appear- ance in an elaborate morning costume; a decided contrast to Lilian's simple muslin dress and plain linen collar. "Ah, Aubrey, how are you?" she said, taking a seat by his side. "You don't alter much; and as for Lil, I can't see that she has changed at all, unless to grow younger and prettier." "I often think so, but did not know whether others would agree with me," he answered, with a loving glance at his wife. "To me she grows more beautiful every day." "That must be'cause she's good and kind, isn't it, Uncle Ailbrey?" asked Lucian. "Papa says the way to grow beautiful to folks we live with, is always to be kind and loving." "Lucian, be quiet; children should be seen and not heard," said Mrs. Dana. "Thatchild's forever quoting his father; he just wearies me to death with it I Yes, Aubrey, my sister certainly does look wonderfully young; but I'm afraid you can't say the same of me?" If in making. that speech she was     "fishing for a compliment," she must  have been sorely disappointed. "No," he said, giving her a glance of keen scrutiny, "to be quite honest with you, sister, I think late hours and high living are telling upon you. You are growing care-worn and old before your time." Florence flushed angrily. "Oh, my dear," said Lilian, "you forget that she is just off from a long and fatiguing journey. When she has rested she will probably look as much younger than I, as, she really is. Come, Flo, there is the breakfast bell. Aubrey has already had his; so we will leave him here to meditate while we eat. Come, little folks, I hope you are hungry enough to do justice to Debby's cooking." "What a wee little breakfast parlor, auntie," remarked Lucian, as they took their places at the table; "it isn't half so big as ours at Lakeside. And you've got such queer, plain kind of furniture. It's very old-fashioned, isn't it, mamma?" "Why, Lucian, how rude  I never can teach that child to be polite," said Florence, turning apologetically to her sister. "I hope you wont mind him." "Not in the least," answered Lilian, smiling. "Politeness is a good thing; but perfect openness and honesty are still better in my esteem." "I didn't mean to be rude, auntie, and I like you and your house ever so much," said the child; adding, " and I hink this is the best breakfast I ever ate." "That is probably because you are very hungry," answered the amused aunt. "How are they at Uncle Lam- bert's?" asked Mrs. Dana. "All quite well-healthy and happy, and, as far as I can see, as young as   they were eight years ago. But they have no foolish shame about being known as grand-parents, and are so proud and fond of Meta's children." "Ah, and Harry Griswold makes her a good husband?" "One of the very best. I don't know a more congenial or happier couple, unless it may be Aubrey and myself." "Well, then, he may thank me for rejecting him, and so ought she," re- marked Florence, with a slight laugh; "but it took him several years to get over his disappointment," Bhe added, with evident satisfaction. "They will all be out here to see you; probably this afternoon," said Lilian; "so I want you to try to get some rest this morning." . "Yes, I will, lest I should be again reminded of my increasing years," an- swered Mrs. Dana, in a piqued tone. "Your husband is not much of a courtier, Lil, but lie's growing quite famous as an author, isn't he? Don't you begin to be proud of him?" "I believe I am, and always was- for his intellectual and moral worth," said Mrs. Falconer, with a look that said more than her words. "Really, it was not quite so bad a match for you as I feared, Lil; you seem to be prospering; and he's making something handsome by his writings, isn't he?" pursued Florence. "His last book brought him ten thousand, and the one he is composing now is, I think, much better. He makes a good deal too on short arti- cles and magazine stories. But, best of all, we both think, is the fact that his writings are doing good-exerting a healthful influence upon society; the evidence of which comes to us in many ways." "Well," laughed Florence, "I have s .    J no hope of ever attaining to such saint- liness as that. I should consider money and fame the highest rewards for my labors, if I undertook to be an author. And Harry Griswold is making both, I hear. Mr. Dana went into rap- tures over that great speech of his in that murder case last spring." "Yes, it was both learned and elo- quent,. and, I assure you, made Meta very proud of her husband." "Yes, I dare say. It was well for her I didn't succeed in making that match for her in Chicago, the winter she paid me that long visit. A bril- liant match I then thought it would be, for Mr. Seymour was worth a very fine property and doing a splendid business; but he's run through it all, and is a perfect sot. I'll never try my hand at match-making again." "No, it's a dangerous business." "How your trees and shrubbery have grown, and how many improve- ments you have made," said Florence, glancing from the window. "It's a perfect little gem of a place now." "It is fair and lovely in our eyes- this little happy home of ours," an- sweied Lilian. The children had finished their breakfast, and were begging for per- mission to run out into the grounds. "Yes, go," said their mother, "'twill be a good riddance. Such little pests as you are-forever teasing about some- thing!" "They are' lovely children, Flor- ence," said her sister, looking after them. "If they were mine, I should love them too well, I'm afraid. I often think it must be very sweet to be a mother." "Well, I don't know that it adds materially to my happiness, Lil; chil- dren are well enough in their way, but one often finds them a great bore.   - There, don't look shocked. I'm fond of mine, of course, and now I've got s them, wouldn't lose them for anything; but as to devoting myself to their amusement and instruction, as Mr. Dana does, and as he's always preach- i ing to me that I ought to, I can't and I wont. I'm sure society has its claims upon me too; claims that I'm not L going to neglect or ignore. I enjoy going out, and entertaining my friends in my own house; and if I had to ; settle down to a dull, humdrum home life, such as Mr. Dana would like to prescribe, I know I should die of ennui in less than a year." "I think you would not find it half so bad as you imagine," said Lilian, smilingly, as they rose from the table, and left the room together. "I would be very loath to exchange. my quiet life forthe gayety and excitement of yours." "Yes, I dare say; but we are as un- like as possible-you and I. I never was meant for a domestic slave, and if I were foolish enough to attempt to wear the fetters, I should do so quite otherwise than gracefully. "And yet I flatter myself, I'm by no means a bad wife and mother. My house is always kept in good order, my table bountifully supplied with the best of everything in its season- thoroughly well cooked too, and served up in the best possible style. Besides, I see to it that my children have plenty of sleep, plenty of out-door exercise, and are kept clean, and handsomely dressed. Their dress, really costs me a great deal of thought, and the expendi- ture of loads of time, trouble, and money. But then I have the satisfac- tion of knowing that not one of my acquaintances can boast that hers are more tastefully attired, hardly one as richly; for I spare no expense, I assure you."      "Do you never fear that you may teach them to care too much for per- sonal adornment?" asked Lilian, as they stepped upon the porch where Aubrey still sat, and she drew forward, for her sister's use, the low rocking- chair usually occupied by herself. "There, if that doesn't sound for all the world just like Mr. Dana.!" ex- claimed Florence, as she accepted the seat. "I've had to fight many a battle with him about their dress; but I'm pretty sure to come off conqueror, ex- cept when he gets the doctor on his side. He did that when Lucian was a baby, and between them they made me cover up his pretty, plump neck and arms with long-sleeved, high-necked aprons and sacques. And last winter, when I'd set my heart on the High- land costume that was so pretty and fashionable, he set his face against it like a flint, and declared he wouldn't have the child going out in the cold with bare knees." "Surely he was right there," said Aubrey, smiling at her indignant tone. "Of course, you would think so; men always stand by each other in such things. And I suppose you would say he was right too in his notion that I ought to keep them constantly with me, let them pester me with questions to their hearts' content, and make my- self a sort of teacher, companion and play-fellow for them, all in one; as he does." "I think it would be the wisest course if you would win and keep their ardent affection, and train them up into such a man and woman as you wish them to be." "Yes, I suppose so; for they idolize their father, while they care compara- tively little for me," she answered, bitterly. Lilian wondered much at the feel-   ings and sentiments expressed by her sister in this conversation, and- all the  more as day by day the little ones crept closer and closer into her warm, loving heart. They grew very fond of her, and of their uncle too, who often entertained them with stories as they hung about his chair. Their childish pity was strongly excited by his helpless. condi- tion, and their active limbs were ever at his service; nothing pleased them better than to be allowed to do some little errand for "poor, dear Uncle Aubrey." "Ah, with such a pair as that to brighten it, our home would be almost a heaven upon earth," he said one day to Lilian, as together they watched the children at play in the garden. Lu- cian is a nolle little fellow, and Milly the sweetest little darling! Ah, dear- est, how much you sacrificed in uniting your fate to mine!" "No, that is altogether a mistake. My heart often 'yearns over those dar- lings, and I am half tempted to envy my sister her treasures; but, ah, my beloved husband, I would not exchange with her; you are better to me than ten sons," she answered, with a look that made his heart leap for joy. Mr. Dana came for his wife and children, and was with them the last few days of their visit. It was very evident that Florence had not exaggerated the fondness of father and children for each other; and quite as patent that the coldness and i indifference of his wife was the one l drop of gall that embittered all the pleasures of this man of wealth and standing in society. He watched with - wistful eyes the loving intercourse be- , tween Aubrey and Lilian, the perfect harmony and sympathy of taste and -- feeling, the deep tenderness of affection,   shown unobtrusively and almost un- consciously in a thousand little ways, and in his heart he envied the poor, helpless cripple as a richer and happier man than himself. This feeling found expression in words one day when the two, left alone together for a time, had insensibly fal- len into an unusually confidential chat,' in which Mr. Falconer was led on to speak' of the intense longing for the power of motion that would at times come over him. "I think you can have no conception of it," he said; "you who have never known what it is to. have your limbs refuse to obey even the slightest behests of your will." "No, my poor fellow, I suppose not; and I have often pitied you from the bottom of my heart," answered Mr. Dana; "and yet-and yet"-his voice grew low and tremulous-" there are moments when I think I could gladly exchange with you for the sake of the true, tender, devoted love so freely be- stowed upon you." "Ah, yes," said Aubrey, his eyes glistening with emotion, "that is the 'compensation Godin his great good- ness, has sent me. And it is compen- sation for even such a fearful loss as mine." "And your success as an author?" "Yes, that too is a great blessing, and very largely owing to her who is, and has been all along, my helper, sympathizer, and comforter; ever en- couraging me to hopefulness, and to determined, persevering effort, in spite of disappointments and depression." "Then your success has not been uniform?" "Oh, no. I presume few, if any, who wield the pen for the entertain- ment or instruction of the public can boast of that, especially in the earlier   part of their career. But when it does come one feels rewarded for all it has cost." CHAPTER XI. "YES, there goes father; off to the village again, leaving all; the chores for Aubrey to do." "Well, Linda, he's been, hard at work in the field all day; so, I s'pose,. we shouldn't blame him." "Aubrey's been all day in the field too, and father's enough stronger than a boy of thirteen." The first speaker was a dark-haired, dark-eyed, rosy-cheeked girl of sixteen or seventeen; the second her mother, a pale, careworn, weary woman, looking ten or fifteen years older than she really was. She had hardly completed her thir- ty-fifth year, yet every vestige of youth- ful bloom had fled; the lines on her fore- liead were many and deep, and her brown hair had grown very thin and grey. It was combed straight back from her face and done up in a little knot behind; there was not the slight- est attempt at ornament, or becoming- ness in its arrangement, or in her attire, which consisted of a cheap, dark calico and a check apron, both spotlessly clean. Linda's dress was of the same inex- pensive material, but more tastefully made, and she wore a linen collar, fas- tened with an old-fashioned brooch, and had placed a rose among the glossy braids of her dark hair, with which it made a very pretty contrast. They were on the' porch before the door of a New England farmhouse, the mother seated in a, low, rush-bottomed, straight-backed chair sewing up a rent in an old coat, already full of patches and darns; Linda standing riear and gazing down the road that led to the     village of Thornton, a quarter of a mile away. "Yes, it is hard on Aubrey, espe- cially when the sun's so hot as it has been to-day. But maybe your father's gone to see if he can't get some help to hire." "What's the use?" exclaimed the girl, in a tone full of scornful impa- tience; "who's going to work for 'close-fisted Dave Regan?" That's what they call him in Thornton and all round the country. And nobody can say he don't deserve it." Mrs. Regan answered only with a sigh, and the girl went on. "If he was the only sufferer I wouldn't care a mite; but it makes me mad to see Aubrey so overworked, and you, too. If I had my way, mother, you should never work another stroke, but just sit and knit, or sew, or read for the-rest of your days." "One would think I was an- old wo. man, to hear you talk, Linda." And the pale lips smiled sadly. "No, you're not old, but you're worn out." "More with trouble and sorrow than with work." "Yes, and that Was his work, too. Oscar would never have run away if he'd got decent treatment at home. He'd. have been here now, alive and well." The hot tears sprang to her eyes as she spoke, while two bitter drops rolled quickly down the mother's cheeks and fell -upon her work. "We can't be quite sure of that, Linda," she answered, in a voice of sup- pressed anguish. "But don't speak of him; it breaksjmy heart." "You know I don't like to hurt you, mother; but I must say that if you don't make father treat'Aubrey a little better you needn't be surprised if he's   off one o' these days too. I'm sure T'd never stand it if I was a boy." "I, Linda? Could I ever make him do anything?" "No, I don't believe you ever did; but if you just wouldn't be quite so meek-spirited, perhaps things might be a little different." "Yes; but I began wrong, and it's too late now. If I'd thought about how it would be with my children, I might, maybe, have plucked up courage to stand out against him at first; but I can't do it now; he's found out what a coward I am, and the more I say the worse it is." David Regan was a hard taskmaster to wife and children, especially so to his sons; and three years before, Oscar, their first-born-then a boy of sixteen -had left the paternal roof and fled to parts unknown. For two years they heard nothing of him, then news came of his sickness and death on shipboard, among strangers and in a foreign land. It nearly broke his mother's heart, and now she clung with excessive fond- ness to her only remaining son, Au- brey. She had lost several children in their infancy, and had now living but two others beside Linda and Aubrey, two little girls of five and three, a happy pair, at this moment engaged in playing "hide and seek" among the trees and shrubbery in the front yard, a shout of childish merriment, or a gleeful, ringing laugh coming now and then to the ears of the mother and older sister. "That's an awful long tear. I don't see how you have a bit of patience to put a needle into'it," remarked Linda, with a scornful glance at the garment on her mother's lap. "I'm sure fath- er's able to give up the old thing and get another, and you wouldn't catch me mendin' it up for him again."   "Well, I 'don't know, child.; he talks more than ever, of late, of hard times and the need there is to save every cent." "Pooh! that's all talk, and I've no patience with it. He could afford easily enough to let me dress like other girls; but, as you know, mother, I can hardly even \get so much as a pair of new shoes or gloves fit to wear to church, or a new neck-ribbon, and never have a better dress than a calico, or the cheapest sort of lawn." "I know; but I can't help it, child," replied the mother, with a deep sigh. "You'd dress as well as any of the rest, if I knew how to manage it for you. I remember how I used to feel when I was a girl. But it's likely you'll all have the more in the end; so take what comfort you can out of that." "Still hard at it, mother? I don't like to see you work so, day in and day out, and looking so tired too all the time." It was Aubrey's voice. He had just come round the corner of the house, and he threw himself on the grass at her feet as he spoke. She had risen from her chair, and seated herself on the porch step in the effort to catch the last of the rapidly waning daylight. "You'll ruin your eyes," he said. "Do put that away till to-morrow." "No, your father will be wanting it to wear; and I'm nearly done now. How warm you are!" "Yes, it's been an awful hot day." "Are all your chores done?" "Yes, ma'am, horses watered, pigs fed, cows taken to pasture, and wood enough split to keep your kitchen fire going all day to-morrow." "You must be' most tired to death,"' said Linda. "I am tired, that's a fact, and my   head aches some too. Mother, I'd like to go to the river and take a swim. Seems to me 'twould rest me a good bit." "Oh, no, no, my son! Not while you are so warm," she exclaimed, in a tone of horror and affright. "Think of your poor uncle, and how terribly he has suffered from doing that very thing." "Poor Uncle Aubreyl What an awful life it must be! I But do you think it could be really just the going into the water while overheated that caused it? Doesn't seem as though it could." "The doetors say so, and it's the only cause anybody's ever been able to find." "How long is it since you've seen him, mother?" "Twelve years, Aubrey: you were barely a year old when he went away. Dear me, how little we know what's before us He told me when he went, he'd be sure to be back again in two years, at the farthest. And now it don't seem likely we'll ever see one another again." "Yes, you shall, mother; I'll soon be a man, and the first hundred dollars I can make you shall have to pay your way out there and back." She dropped her work for an instant, to pass her hand caressingly over his damp hair. "It's just the way he used to talk," she said, in a tone of mingled sorrow and affection. "He was always plan- ning to help and comfort me; and he has too, dear, generous creatures that they both are!  With your father holding on tighter and tighter to his money every- year, I don't know how I'd have got any decent clothes to put on your backs, if it hadn't been for them."     "Aunt Lilian must be just the best  woman alive, next to you, mother."  "She's a noble woman. .I don't know another in this wide world that would be willing to devote herself to a  man in my poor brother's condition. And yet, dear knows, Aubrey, sick and helpless, is better worth having than' some men in sound health and strength." "A great deal better as it's turned out," remarked Linda.  "Anybody might be proud to be related to a great author liker uncle. I'm sure I alm. And Aunt Lilian must be sweet and good. I'm glad you named the baby for her, mother." "That reminds me that those chil- dren ought to be put to bed, Linda; they have to be up so early in the mornings, you know; for your father wont allow them. to lie abed, for fear they'll get into bad habits for the time when they're old enough to be of some use." "Yes, mother, I'll call 'em and put them to bed. You just sit still." The little ones came to say good- night, then Aubrey and his mother were left alone. It had grown too dark now for her to see to set another stitch. The old worn coat was thrown aside, her boy laid his head in her lap, and she softly passed her toil-hardened hand over his hair, now and then exchanging a word or two with him. They were both too weary for much conversation, but through all the years of her remaining life a sad but untold sweetness lingered about the, memories of that quiet interview. "You're very tired,"she said at length; "hadn't you better go to bed?" '4 Oh, not yet," he answered, coax- ingly; "'taint often I get my head on your lap now-a-days, since I've   grown so big and old, mother. It aches a little, and the soft way you're moving your hand over it seems to soothe away half the pain. Besides, I don't feel like moving, now I'm down -unless you want to go." "No, child, no; I feel like you do- as if I don't care to move when once I've set myself down." "It's cooler out-doors than in the house, too." "Yes, the house seems hot and close, and one hates to go in."' So they sat there till the sky was full of, stars, and the moon had risen above the tree tops. "There's your father, and he'll be cross enough to find us out here at this hour!"Mrs. Regan said, with 'a start, as they heard the gate swing to, and a heavy tread upon the gravel walk. The boy rose slowly and shook him- self. "What, you up yet, you young dog?" growled a harsh, unpleasant voice, as the father, a tall, strong, coarse-featured man, came striding to- ward them. "Don't let me hear any grumbling about getting up to-morrow morning, nor have to call you twice neither. Off to bed with you this in- stant!" "Yes, sir. Good-night, mother." And the boy disappeared within the doorway. Mrs. Regan followed, and her hus- band brought up the rear, grumbling, growling and scolding. The harsh sounds were in Aubrey's ears while he stripped off his clothes and threw himself upon the bed. But scarcely had his head found a resting- place upon the pillow when he fell into a heavy slumber. His father's voice roused him. "Get up this minute, sir; it's four o'clock, and we must be in the field by   five, or half-past, at the farthest. There's nobody to do the reaping but you and me, and all the stock's got to be 'tended to first. Mind now, don't let me have to call you again." "Dear me, I'm not half rested; don't seem as if I'd been on the bed an hour," sighed the boy, wearily, as he rose and stretched himself, then began to dress. That did not take many minutes, and he was soon bringing the cows up to the barnyard to be milked. "How's the head this morning, son?" his mother asked, as he came in to breakfast. "Oh, I'm all right enough," he an- swered, brightly, though sensible that the pain had slightly increased since the night before. But he loved his mother, and wished to relieve her from anxiety on his account. He had been exerting himself to the utmost, lest some of his chores should fall to her. He was always on the watch to save the pale, careworn wo- man from fatigue, and to cheer her with smiles and pleasant words. Is it to be wondered at that he was the very apple of her eye? "It's an awful hot day," remarked little Nellie, as they took their places at the table; " seems as if I can't hardly breathe, and that stone door-step's most hot enough to burn you a'ready. I know,'cause I was on it just now with my bare feet." "Well, you  needn't complain," growled the father; "you've got noth- ing to do but stay in the house and keep yourself cool." "It'll be hard on you and Aubrey, though," remarked Mrs. Regan. "I wish you could manage to hire some help with the harvesting, David. I don't see how you and he can ever get through with it alone." "What has to be done can be done,   Adah; so no more words about it. I tried to get help last night, but couldn't do it. So, young man (turning to his son), you may as well make up your mind not to try shirking; for the ; work's got to be done." "I mean to do my share, father," answered the boy. "And your share'll be to work steady along side o' me till the job's done. Mind that." It was scarcely half-past five when the two entered the harvest-field, yet even at that early hour the sun's rays were very powerful. The heat increased rapidly as he ascended higher in the heavens, and by noon it was scorching. For the last hour Aubrey had felt it almost beyond endurance, and found himself growing so faint and sick that he thought he should fall to the ground. Never was the sound of the dinner-horn more welcome, yet he scarcely ate a mouthful. His mother noticed it with concern. "You are not well, my son," she said; "you seem to have quite lost your appetite." "And his color, too, eh?" sneered the father, glancing at the flushed and sunburnt face. "No; but sick folks aren't always pale, David; you know that as well as I." "Father," said the boy, "I do feel real sick. I don't think I can work this afternoon." "What's the matter? Whereabouts are you sick?" "I don't know, sir; I can't tell; but I feel sick all over." "Nonsense 1 if you can't tell where you're sick, there aint much the mat- ter, I'll be bound; so I'll have no shirk- ing, as I said this morning." Aubrey rose from the table with a weary, despairing sigh.     "-David, that child's not fit to go to work again in this hot sun; can't you see that?" cried the wife and mother, roused, by maternal love and pity, out of her accustomed meek submission to her husband's will. "No, I can't, and what's more, I'll th not put up with any interference in my we affairs from you or anybody else. The work's got to be done, and you know as well as I do that I can't do it alone." "Then you ought to hire help." us "I told you I tried and couldn't. he They all made out they didn't know as they'd ever get their pay, and I don't know as they would either, for thes are mighty hard times." "But you can pay for help, and you ought to, rather than to drive that poor child out to work when he's sick," she answered, with unusual spirit. "Pay i 'em in advance, and you'll get 'em to e take hold fast enough." "Pay'em in advance! Is the woman gone stark, staring mad?. One, would suppose I was made of money. I tell you, I can't afford it. If you had your . way we'd all go to ruin directly. I tell you, we've all got to work, Aubrey as well as the rest." "He's not fit to go into the field un- der this broiling sun again to-day, and if you kill him now, you'll have nobody , to help you next year," she said, mak- ing one last effort for the child of her love. ( I'll risk it ", was the unfeeling re- joinder. "Come along, Aubrey." The mother followed to the door and watched them out of sight, then turned to her work again with an aching heart. Linda had looked on with rising in- dignation during the little scene. "Mother," she cried, " what on earth did you ever marry father for? I   wouldn't have had him if he'd been the last man in the world." "I don't know, child. I think I must have been crazy; and I wish they'd put me in the mad-house before they let me do it. But I was a young thing, scarce turned of fifteen, and we were orphans-Aubrey and me-and I wanted a good home for myself and him; and David Regan said he'd pro- vide it, and would always be good to us both, and he'd a nice farm and good ,house, and wasn't bad looking; so I took him.  But, Linda, child, take warning by your mother, and don't marry unless you love the man with all your heart, and are perfectly sure that he's good-tempered and kind- hearted and generous." "I'll do better than you did, or I'll live and die single," answered the girl, energetically. That was a. dreadful afternoon to Aubrey Regan; his weak and trem- 1 bling limbs almost refused to support him, the sickle almost fell from his nerveless hands, and the burning sun I beat pitilessly upon his aching head. It seemed unendurable; his brain be- gan to reel, he dropped his sickle, and cast himself down upon the ground in d the shade of a great oak that spread out its wide, sheltering arms near by. yr His father was at work in another part of the field, but keeping watch r over the boy by an occasional glance in his direction. Missing him, he e- strode forward to learn what had be- come of him. Id  Seeing him upon the ground, "Get 'd up from that, you lazy'dog!" he cried; "g C get up, I say, and go to your work again this instant." n-  "Father, I'm sick," moaned the boy. "I can't work; indeed I :can't. My th head's like to split; and the sun makes I it worse every minute."   "Hold your tongue! I don't believe a word of it! I say it's nothing but laziness, and if there's no other way, I'll flog it out of you. Get right up now; dip your handkerchief in 'the brook yonder and put it into the crown df your hat, and then go to work again with a will. And mind now, if I catch you lying down again I'll go for the horse-whip, and use it too." The poor child staggered to his feet and managed to obey, toiling on till the supper-horn summoned them to the house, then creeping homeward till he fell down upon the porch in a state of semi-unconsciousness. His mother saw him fall, and sprang forward with a low cry, "My son, O my son!" She took off his hat and laid her hand-on his forehead; it was burning hot. "He's in a raging fever," she moaned. "Linda, a basin- of cold water." The girl brought it instantly. Her eyes were full of tears of mingled sor- row and indignation as she stooped to bathe the fevered cheeks. "Mother, let us carry him to his bed; E we can do it together, and he's fit for nothing else; he'll not be able to leave ; it to-night, nor to-morrow. And, oh, I mother, shan't I go for the doctor?" ] Mrs. -Regan shook her head. "Your father wont allow  it; but s we'll take him in and do what we can E for him. Aubrey, son, can you help yourself at all?  Could you walk to i your room, leaning  on Linda and 1 me?" A  low moan and an incoherent mur- ^ mur were his only answer.     f "He   doesn't know a word you're b saying, mother," said Linda; "we'll b just have to carry him, or get father to when he comes in."         n "Why, what's all this?" asked the 1   e rough voice of Mr. Regan behind t them. He had stopped for a moment to ? speak with a neighbor at the gate, and 3 was now at the threshold of his dwell- ing. "The child's very sick, David; no mistake about it now. He's quite out of his head, and in a raging fever," answered the wife. "He's past help- ing himself, and will have to be taken to his room. Will you carry him in there?" "Of course I will, if necessary. Out o' the way, Linda. Aubrey, Aubrey, I say, Aubrey, can't you raise up and help yourself a little? Can't you walk as fur as the bed-room with the help o' my arm? Come, try now. I think you can," he said, stooping over the prostrate form. But the boy neither moved nor opened his eyes. "He doesn't hear you," said the mother, sadly; " his reason's gone; he's a very sick child." "Come now, Adah, what's the use of croaking? A good night's sleep 'll set him up again in all likelihood," re- returned the father, taking the uncon- scious boy in his arms and carrying him to his room, where he laid him on his bed. It was almost gently done; perhaps some feeling akin to pity or remorse stirred in his rough breast. "Linda," said Mrs. Regan, "pour the tea for your father, and wait on the little ones. My work is here." They went out and left her alone with him; and with a heart full of sad forebodings, she began her efforts for his relief. Alas, was she ever to see him rise again from that sick bed? "What's the matter with Aubrey? Why did father have to carry him? And what makes mother stay in there     with hiln?" asked the wondering chil- dren.         ,      s "He's sick," answered Mr. Regan, t shortly.              e "O father, is he very bad?"   h "No, I guess not very. Come to a your suppers, and stop asking ques- s a tions." "Father," said Linda, as she handed t him his second cup, " wont you go for Dr. Scott, or let me?"  "No, 'taint worth while; your mother's about as good as, a doctor, ] and a deal cheaper." "Yes, sir, when there's not much the matter; but-I'm afraid Aubrey's very E sick this time."  "NonsenseI A headache and some fever with it; that's all; and I'll war- rant he'll be up again in a day or two. I'm sure, I hope so; for I need his help powerful bad." "I wish you'd consent to have the doctor," persisted Linda, " if it's only to make sure that it's nothing worse than you think; so many dreadful kinds o' sickness' begin with headache and fever." "Girl, do you think I'm made o' money? I tell you you're vastly mis- taken, if you do. I can't begin to afford to call in a doctor every time one or another of you chooses to give up and play sick." "There's no play about it this time," cried Linda, indignantly. "Aubrey never gives up for a trifle, and his life's worth more than money; you'd better lose afew dollars than lose him." "Of course; but I calculate to hold on to both." Mr. Regan rose with an unpleasant, mocking laugh, pushed back his chair, took his hat, and went out to attend to the chores usually allotted to his son. Linda rose too, and began energeti- cally piling up the cups and plates. \'   "No more feeling than a beast l" she muttered. "Hardly as much, for they love their young; sometimes well enough to die defending 'em. How is he now?" she asked, turning quickly, as the door of Aubrey's room opened softly, and her mother came out. ," He seems to be sleeping: uneasily though, and moaning very often." "Poor fellow! Shall I sit by him while you eat your supper?" "No, I'm  not wanting anything. I'm after some colder water to bathe his head with. I wish we had some ice." "I'll run over to Mr. Price's for some; they've loads of it, and they're always kind in sickness." "Yes, do, if you're not too tired-- there'll be all the work to do up after you get back." "I know, mother, but I'd do a grefit deal more than that for Aubrey. I only wish I might go on to Dr. Scott's; but father wont hear of it." "No, I; knew he wouldn't," Mrs. Regan answered, with a sigh. "But, perhaps, my poor boy may be better by to-morrow. We will hope so at least." "Mother, do sit down and try to eat  a little," urged Linda; "you'll not s have strength to nurse him if you i don't. I'll get the water. I'll send the bucket down to the very bottom ' of the well, to have it as cold as pos- r sible." s  "You're a dear child, and I'll drink I a cup of tea, and try to eat a bite for ' your sake and his," said her mother, ] yielding her the pitchershe had brought from the sick room, and taking a seat t, at the table.        , r, "I don't see how we're to manage, o if this should prove a long sickness," she remarked, as Linda reappeared i- with the pitcher. "The neighbors are kind, but they all have their hands   full with harvesting just now; your father wouldn't consent to our hiring any help, and even if he would, I don't know where it's to be had." "Well, mother, don't worry; you know there's a saying that'the back is always fitted to the burden,' and I've heard folks tell that they'd found the truth of it come true in just such straits as this. So I believe I'll have strength for the work, and you for the nursing. Now, I'm off after the ice." She snatched her sun-bonnet from its nail, caught up a basket and tin pan, and sped away through the yard and across the fields. "She is walking much too fast for this hot weather," murmured the mother, looking after her; "she'll be making herself sick too, and what should I ever do without ,her-dear, thoughtful, helpful child!" And taking up her pitcher, she went back to the sick room. All night long Mrs. Regan sat by the bedside, fanning  her boy's flushed cheeks, bathing his hot head with cold water, and doing all that a mother's love and care could do for his relief.  But morning   found him with a 1 higher fever, uttering more frequent i and  deeper moans, and tossing, and i now and then crying out, in a wilder t delirium. Linda came at an early hour to ask E how he was.            r Her mother's answering look was v full of anguish. "Worse, oh, much worse!  I must, 1 I will have the doctor, and that with- i out delay. I've thought it all over, t and I'll find some way to pay for him. b My   brother would help me, I know; a he's always been very fond of his name- sake, and he'd do anything he could fi for me too. So you may run over for a Dr. Scott now, if you will. No matter w   tr if your father does scold about the g milking and the breakfast being late. 't It can't he helped." "But there's the doctor just riding a byl" cried Linda, glancing from the k  window, then rushing from the house i and calling out to him to stop. d  In another minute he was by the i bedside. "Things here have not been tidied e up yet, doctor, but you'll excuse it, I know," said Linda, as she brought l him in. "Certainly.   Good-morning, Mrs. IRegan.   This is a very sick child. When was he taken?" "He has complained a little for a , day or two past, but wasn't taken down X till last evening." "I should have been called at once; such delays are always dangerous," He did not ask, "Why was I not sent for?"  He knew the characters of David Regan and his wife well enough to conjecture the cause of the neglect, and to spare her the pain of acknowledging it. He pronounced the disease brain- fever, and to the father-when the mother was not present-lhe said that it had been brought on, and greatly aggravated by continued exposure to the burning heat of the sun. From the first he was silent with re- gard to' hope of recovery, and the mother knew that meant there was very little, if any. Yet she would not allow herself to look forward to the end, but whisper- ing to her sinking heart, "While there's life, there's hope," she watched beside him day and night, scarcely allowing herself any rest or sleep. Linda's toil was but little lighter, for upon her young shoulders now fell all the labor and care hitherto shared with her mother. As they had fore.     seen, no help was to be had, and she did the work, bore her father's growl- ing and scolding, and kept the little ones from disturbing the invalid with their noise. Thus two weeks had run their weary round, when one morning the boy opened his eyes and looked up into his mother's face. Her heart gave a wild throb as she noted their intelligent expression . "My son, my dear son!" she mur- mured, almost under her breath, as she leant over him, and laid her hand gently upon his. He clasped his wasted fingers feebly over it. "Mother, 'dear mother, am I too big? too old?" She barely caught the words--the voice was so low and faint. "Too big and old for what, my son?" "You know what He said-' Suffer the-little-children -- '" "No, my boy, oh, no, No I Nobody's ever too big or too old to go to Him. And He never turned any away that tried it; no, not one-not even the woman that was a sinner, nor the thief on the cross." A smile of unutterable sweetness and joy unspeakable passed over his features. His eyes had closed as he murmured the last broken words, but they opened again, and were once more lifted to hers with a look of intense love and gratitude. "' Dearest mother-Jesus -- " The lids fell, and thie fingers loosened their clasp on hers. He was gone: she knew it---knew that never more in this world should she hear the tones of his dear voice, feel the clasp of his hand,. or meet the loving glance of his sweet blue eye- ryet she neither moved nor shed a tear. The blow had fallen too crushingly:   she was stunned, bewildered by its terrible weight. A   heavy, though cautious tread crossed the floor, and she looked up to see her husband standing at the foot of the bed, gazing with awestruck countenance upon the still, white face of the silent sleeper there. And now -at sight of him-all the pent up anguish of her heart burst forth. "Yes, draw near and look upon your work; cruel, unnatural father that you are!" she said, in low, shud- dering tones. "Cruel, wicked man, you've robbed me of both my sons, and I could curse you for it." Her bitter words, afnd the strange, unnatural look on her face, startled and alarmed him. He turned about and hurried from the room. Linda was getting the breakfast. "Child," he said, "your brother's gone, and-and'I think your mother's lost her reason. Go to her." Linda uttered a cry, "O Aubrey, my brother." In a moment she was by the bedside. She found her mother on her knees, her eyes fixed in a stony gaze upon the face of the dead. She was moaning to herself in low, piteous tones. "He's gone, my Aubrey, my dear, beautiful boy  For a year he has been mine only son: always mine own and well beloved: always caring for his mother, always loving her best of all- promising to be the stay and staff of her old age. My son, my son, oh, my son i" "O mother, mother, don't grieve so! Don't have that dreadful, stony look on your dear face I It breaks my heart to see it!" cried Linda, falling on her knees by her parent's side, and putting an arm  lovingly about her neck. "Mother dear, if you could only cry. :Tears would, ease your poor, bursting ear wo   heart. Mother, he's happy and well now, and he'll never, never have to toi'l and suffer any more. And you haven't lost us-Nellie, and Lily, and me; and we love you dearly, dearly, and will-always, always. O mother, Wvill you-go and break your heart, and make us lose you too?" The simple, loving words had touched the right chord, and now the blessed tears came to the relief of the over- strained nerves, and the saving of the reason already tottering upon her' throne; they fell like rain as mother and daughter clasped each other in a closer and yet closer embrace. CHAPTER XII. BUT Mrs. Regan never recovered from the loss of this her second and only remaining son; from that e day she was a changed woman; quiet and careworn she had been for years, but from this time a mournful cadence ever lingered in the tones of her voice, and her words were few, and often sorrowful. In her husband also a change was quite perceptible. Whether grief for Aubrey's untimely death, or remorse for his share in bringing it about, was preying upon his mind, or Whether there was some other disturbing cause at work to embitter his feelings, not one of his family knew; but certain it was, that day by day he grew more morose, and more niggardly, and his voice was oftener heard in chiding, re- proach, or threatening, in grumbling and snarling; and his hand more fre- quently raised against his children and the dumb creatures subject to his sway. He -seemed to grudge every mouthful eaten at his table, and was constantly 6   prophesying that they would end their days in the poor-house. Linda's wrath waxed hot against him; for she saw that all this was slowly wearing her mother away. She told him so one day, in a burst of un- controllable indignation; adding that she began to think the sooner their fate overtook them, the better; as, per- haps, they might then hope for a little peace and quietness. It often struck Mrs. Regan as strange how much more her husband would take from Lindaj than from herself, ot any one else. He seemed astonished at this outhurst, but rose and left the house without a word of reply. "Peace and quietness," murmured his wife. ":I don't expect to find them anywhere but in ily grave." "Mother, don't!" cried Linda. "I must believe you'll have a little of them here, -some day, or my heart would break." November had come; the ground was frozen hard; a few flakes of snow and many heavy frosts had already fallen on Aubrey's grave; flowers no longer bloomed for loving hands to scatter upon it; and chilling winds swept,round the house, and moaned in the chimneys; yet Mr. Regan would allow but one fire, and sternly forbade the purchase of any new garments to shield wife or children from the win- -ter's cold. He turned his steps toward the vil- lage, and was gone for an hour or more. He came back pale, haggard, with bowed head and stooping shoul- ders. "What's the matter, David? Are you sick?" asked his wife, looking at him in surprise and some alarm.  No; hold your tongue, and mind your own business," he answered, in his sharpest tone; "I hope I'm capa-     ble of managing my own affairs with- out any of your making or meddling." "Nellie, bring mother a few sticks of wood from the wood-house," said Mrs. Regan. "And, Linda, put some into the stove." "No, don't you do any such thing, Linda!" thundered her father. "The fire's too hot already; you're burning me out of house and home; and I say, I wont have it!" "David, are you crazy?" said his wife. "The bread is in the oven, and the fire must be kept up to bake it." "Hush, woman I I say I'll not have another stick burnt to-night," he cried, furiously, as Nellie threw down her armful of wood on to the hearth. "Do you mean to freeze us? It isn't four o'clock, and that fire wont last half an hour without replenishing." "You can go to bed and keep your- selves warm." "Linda and I :can't, nor can you; there's too much to be done. Besides, as I said before, there's not fire enough; here to bake the bread." "Then, let it go unbaked." "And have to put it in the pig-slop, , and make some more. That would be tar worse waste than the other." "No, I'll not allow it to be thrown away, I assure you. I'll have it eaten;  every crumb of it."  "Then I'll see that it's sufficiently - baked to make wholesome food for my c children's eating,". she answered, with E a spirit she had seldom shown before. X "You've killed my sons, but you shall 1 not murder my daughters."     E She stooped, threw open the door of  the stove, and with her owu hands a filled it with wood as she spoke. r He rose and stood before her, white with passion,           a ' 'Woman, you're ruining me! I tell a you I'm little better than a beggar. v    -Every cent of my hard earnings-rthe 'fruits of years of pinching, and saving, and hard labor--has been swept away in a moment, and I stand before you here a ruined and despairing man. But go on with your extravagance, the game will soon be played out; 'twont be long before you'll come to the end of your string." He turned and went out of the house, walking with hasty strides to- ward the barn; perhaps with the in- tent to feed his cattle, though the hour was unusually early for that. Wife and children looked at each other in wonder and bewilderment. "He's certainly going crazy," said, the former. "Something's made him dreadfully angry," said Linda. "But do you think, mother, that he really has lost everything?" "No, child; a few hundred dollars, perhaps. Such losses are always very severe to him; worse than parting wit!h his children--a great deal." Thle last words were spoken very low and absently, as if she were hardly conscious of breathing them aloud. They went on quietly with theil work. Half an hour later Linda took her bucket and set off for the barnyard to milk her cows. Presently a wild shriek startled iMrs. Regan and the children, and rushing to the door, they saw Linda speeding across the fields toward the nearest neighbors, her bonnet off, her hair streaming in the wind, while she seemed almost to fly over the ground. "O mother, what's the   matter?" asked Nellie.  "What makes sister run so fast?" "I don't know, child. Stay here and keep Lily with you, while I go and see." .  Her face was deathly pale, and her   voice shook with a nameless terror. What she feared she knew not; but that something terrible had happened she could scarcely doubt. Leaving the children where they were, she hastened toward the barn. Linda's empty bucket lay on the ground. near to the door, which had bleen left unfaistened, and was slowly swinging in the wind. Mrs. Regan came panting up, and catching hold of it, pulled it wide open. What a sight met her eyes! The body of her husband suspended from a beam by a rope round 'the neck, with face swollen and purple, protruding tongue, and eyes starting from their sockets. She staggered back, covering her eyes with her hand to shut out the horrid spectacle; a deathly sickness almost overpowered her, and she was near falling to the ground. But perhaps life was not yet extinct. Tlhe thought roused her to exertion, and, still shuddering with fear and horror, she looked hurriedly about for a knife, With which to cut the rope. There was none to be found, and she was beginning a hasty ascent of the ladder that led to the hay-loft; when hearing the voices of her children ap- proaching, she sprang down again, and rushed out to meet and prevent them from entering. Should their whole future' lives be haunted by the dreadful memory of that most horrible spectacle?. No, never! She must save them from it. He was gone, and she could do nothing to bring him back to life and hope. Slie caught a hand of each in one of hers, and crying in low, husky tones, "O come away, come away," drew ,them back toward the house. "Mother, what's the matter? Why wont you let us go into the barn?"   they asked, looking up with awe and affright into her pale, terror-stricken face. "Never mind; don't -ask me," she said, shudderingly, pressing their hands tighter in hers, and hurrying them onward. They reached the house, she dropped into a chair, put an arm roulnd each, and drew them close to her, hiding her face on Nellie's shoulder., Again they asked, more wonderingly, more fearfully, what was the matter. But shudder after shudder, and long, sobbing sighs were the only answer. But soon swift footsteps and exci- ted voices were heard outside, and Linda came flying in and dropped down at her mother's feet, burying her face in her lap, and sobbing hysterically. "O Linda, Linda, what is the mat- ter?" cried Nellie. "Mother wont tell us, and she wouldn't let us go into the barn.  Why mustn't we go there? And what made you scream so loud and run off so fast to Mr. Price's?- And what are you crying so for now? Oh, I wish you'd speak and tell me; it scares me so to have you and mother act so queer." With a: violent effort the poor girl checked her sobs. "Mother," she said, low and tremu- lously, " come into the bed-room and lie down. They'll be here in a minute, and I'll have them carry him into the parlor and lay him on the settee. I'll attend to , everything. Children, if you'll stay quietly in the bed-room with mother I'll, give you each a big piece of gingerbread, and after a little you shall come out here again, and I'll tell you what's the matter."   / The little ones consented readily, and followed their mother, as Linda sup- ported her into the next room and     lielped'her to lie down on the bed that used to be Aubrey's. Mrs, Regan hid her face in the pil- lows. Linda brought a heavy shawl and threw it over her, tucking it in tenderly and carefully about her shoul- ders; then went out, and returned with the promised gingerbread and a warm cloak for each child. "There, put these on to keep you from taking cold in here away from the fire, and don't make a noise to dis- turb poor mother," she whispered, straining them to her full heart for an instant, and kissing them with a pas- sionate fervor of affection, while her warm tears fell on their cheeks. "What malke you ky so, Linny? I loves you," cooed the youngest, clinging abiout her neck. Another hug, another passionate kiss were the only answer, and Linda tore herself away, shutting the door softly behind her as she left the room. She heard heavy steps on the porch, and shuddering and trembling from head to foot, made haste to open the outer door. "Which way?" asked one of the men, in a voice that was full of kindly compassion. Linda silently pointed to the open door of the parlor, and they bore the body in and laid it gently down, thenl stood for. a moment, with uncovered heads and awe-struck faces, silently gazing upon the swollen and distorted features. A kindly-faced, motherly looking woman had followed them into the fa- mily room. As they came out again she had her arims about the sobbing Linda, stroking her hair, and patting her on the shoulder, softly murmuring, " Poor child, poor child, don't cry so, 'dear, don't!" while all the time weep- ing almost as bitterly herself.   "I can't help it. O Mtrs. Price,'if I'd always been a good daughter to him; but I haven't!" "Well, dear, I dare say you had your provocations; and this was his own doing, as we may say. But there, don't shudder so; -he must, have been a bit lunatic at the. time-of course he must-such a pillar as he always was in the church, never missing of a prayer- meetin' nor nothin', and a taking up of the collections; and all that." -Linda raised her head, withdrew her- self from the kindly embrace, and wi- ping away her tears, began trying to set the room to rights. "There, dear, don't trouble yourself."' said her visitor. "Just you go in to your mother and comfort her all you can, and I'll see to matters here." " Thank you. Oh, there are the cows to be milked! I was forlgetting all about them." "Never you mind, child; -we'll 'tend to that, too. I see Mrs. Curtis anld Mrs. Parsons a comin' up the hill; they'll take hold here, and my John- nie'll do the milkin' while he's awaitin' here for the crownqr to fetch his jury and come and set on the body." "The coroner! O Mrs. Ppice, does he have to come?" "Why, yes, child, that's accordin' to law; 'it's got to be done in such cases. But don't turn so white; you needn't be scared; it's only old Billy Richards from t'other side o' the, river-you know him, I guess, for he 'tends our meetin' mostly-and the jury'll just be a dozen o' the neighbors."    . Still Linda shuddered and trembled, and her cheek was pale as ashes as she asked, "Will I have to come before them?" "Yes, I s'pose you'll have to tell when you saw him last alive and well; and how you found him out there in   the barn;- and whether any strange man's been seen about; so's they'll be able to give a true verdick, you know. Now, dear, do go and sit with your mother, I'll clear up and get every- thing ready for the crowner; and if you think you or your mother could eat a bite, or take a cup o' tea, I'll fetch it in presently." "Oh, no, no; I couldn't touch a mouthful!" cried Linda, turning away, with the feeling that she should forever loathe the very sight of food. But the two neighbors Mrs. Price had seen approaching were tapping at the door; and, shrinking from the gaze of curious, even though kindly eyes, she hastily made her escape into the room where she had left her mother and the children. Mrs. Regan was still lying motion- less, with her face buried in the pil- lowss; and hoping she slept, Linda trod lightly, and closed the door with care to make no sound. The two little ones had finished their gingerbread, and were crouching in a corner, whispering together with wide-open eyes and pale, anxious faces. That something was wrong seemed very evident; but their poor little brains were sorely puzzled to conjecture what it might be. They started up at Linda's approach, and clinging to her skirts, begged, in an eager whisper, to be told what was the matter. "You know you promised to tell us, sister, if we'd be good," said Nellie, "and we have; we've been as quiet as mice." "Yes, you're dear, good children. I'll tell you," she answered, in the same low tone, sitting down and. gath- ering them both close to her bosom. "Father's dead." she added, with a   gush of tears. "You'll never see him again-never!" "But why can't wet? We saw Au- brey when he was dead." "Yes; but father did not die like Aubrey; he doesn't look at all like himself, and I would not have you see him for the world!" she said, shud- dering. "Well, then, we ,wont ask. But, Linda, you're not going to let mother die, too? We couldn't do without her." "No, no indeed! Oh, I hope she'll live till we're all old and greyl But don't you want some supper?" "Yes; may we have some more gin- gerbread?" "All you can eat. Go out there and Mrs. Price will give you whatever you want; and as soon as you're done eat- ing come right back here." "But it's cold here, Linda." "Well, then stay by the fire, if you want to, only--only don't go near the parlor; promise me that." "No, we'll stay in the sitting-room all the time." "And don't be frightened if a good many men come in, or women either; they're only our neighbors, and wont hurt you." "No; we'll not be a bit scared; if we are we'll run in here to you and mother." Left alone with her mother, Linda drew near the side of the bed and leaned over her, listening for the sound of her breathing. A sudden shiver told her that she was awake. "Mother, dearest mother," mur- mured the young girl, very low and tenderly. ' Mrs. Regani started up and caught her daughter's hand in a vice-like grasp. "Child!" she cried, hoarsely, "has the coroner come? Are they asking who did it? Go and tell them     'twas your mother; that she drove him to it with her dreadful words-telling him he'd killed her sons and wanted to murder her daughters. Go, g6 and tell them, and let them take me out and hang me to the nearest tree. Then I'll have it over, and be done-with this miserable life 1"  There was a wild glare in her eye that told of insanity as plainly as her words. The sun had long since set, but the full moon, shining in at the window by their side, gave Linda as clear and distinct a view of her coun- tenance as if it had been broad day- light. The girl's heart was like to break. "Mother, O  mother " she cried, clasping her tightly in her arms, " how can you talk so? Don't you remember that he told us he'd just lost all his money? His money that he always loved a great deal better than wife or children. It was that-only that-that made him do it. . He would have done it just the same if you had never said a word. And- your words were the truth, too, and nothing but the truth. Dear mother, don't fret; I know it was no fault of yours, and I hope you'll be happier without him  than ever you were with him." "And am I not to blame?" -' Not in the very least, mother, dear." She heaved a long, deep-drawn sigh of relief, and let her head fall upon her daughter's shoulder, her arms clinging about the slender, girlish form as her only remaining earthly support. Linda felt it to her heart's core- realized that she was now no longer to lean upon her mother, but hencefor- ward to be her stay, her staff, and her protector, as well as comforter and con-  soler; her provider also if, as she feared from her father's words, their all of worldly wealth was gone. And the little   L ones? Yes, they too must be provided for' by her slender strength. But her young spirit rose up bravely to meet the emer. gency-she resolved that they should never want while life and health were hers. There was a tap at the door, quickly followed by the entrance ofMrs. Price. "I'm dreadful sorry to have to dis- turb you," she said, coming softly to- ward them; " but the crowner and the rest's come, and the 'quest's holdin' and so -- "Yes, yes," interrupted Linda, turn- ing yery pale, and shuddering from head to foot. "I'll go. Am I wanted now if" "Right away, dear, and your mother too; but don't be seared: it's only friends and neighbors, you know, and all feelin' for you both as if you was their own folks." Linda whispered a word or two in her mother's ear, and putting an arm about her waist, assisted her to get upon  her feet.  Mrs. Regan moved totteringly, and would have fallen but for the support of that young arm. "She   looks dreadful ill," cried Mrs.. Price, in a shocked tone, catching sight of the ashen face and wildly gleaming eyes. "Wait a   bit, Linda, and I'll fetch her apglass of wine." "There is nones; father never allowed it in the house." "Yes, I  knowed that; and knowed 'twould likely be wanted too, and so I fetched some along when I come from home. Wait here till I get her a glass: she'll faint, sure as the world, without it." Linda drew her mother to a seat on I the side of the bed, while their kind neighbor .hurried out of the room. Mrs. Regan laid her head on her daughter's shoulder, and seemed to resign herself passively to her control.   Mrs. Price was gone scarcely more than a moment. Linda took the wine- glass from her hand, and held it to her mother's lips. "Drink it, dear mother," she said, low and tenderly.  "I hope it will do you good. I know you are feeling faint and weak," and Mrs. Regan swallowed it without a word. It seemed to revive her somewhat, and they led her to the parlor, where the coroner was holding his inquest. Wife and daughter gave their testi- mony-the one -merely answering questions in an absent, incoherent way that showed a wandering intellect- the other in a calm, straightforward, lucid manner; though with quivering lips, blanched cheeks, and eyes filled to overflowing. The men who had cut him down testified that they had found the body entirely cold, and the phllysiciins gave it as'their opinion that life must have been extinct for some time  before Linda discovered him. The verdict rendered was: "Death by suicide; probably in a temporary fit ofinsanity." It soon became evident to all who saw her, that Mrs. Regan was in no state to be applied to for directions concerning the arrangements for the funeral, or the management of any of her affaits I.  Linda, was, therefore, obliged to take the helm; but, young as she was, she performed her task nobly; showing herself fully capable of all that was required of her. - The neighbors did what they could to assist her, and Mr. James Regan-- a brother of her father's, living at the distance of a dlay's journey-was at  once sent for, and arrived in time to relieve her of a portion of her cares and responsibilities. He undertook the settlement of the   L estate., He was a prompt, energetic - business man, and was soon able to in- rform Linda that her father's losses were much lighter than he had repre- sented them.- Though often heard to utter strong ; condemnation of speculating in general, and of several persons in particular who had been ruined by it, David Regan had at length succumbed to the temptation to invest in oil-lands, and the sinking of oil-wells. Believing that there was every prospect of reap- ing a golden harvest, he had sold out his store, and invested in the venture every dollar he could raise without mortgaging his farm. Fortunately for his family, he had not been quite so infatuated as to do that; and, there- fore, though the vaunted oil-lands had proved nearly worthless, and the wells productive of nothing more valuable for commercial purposes than water, so that all the money put into them might as well have been   literally thrown away-yet the widow and or- phans were left by no means destitute. The farm, if rightly managed,.would yield them a comfortable support. Why then did the husband and father take his own life?  Because money was his idol, and he could not endure the loss of so large a sum-- could not realize, at the moment, that what was left was of any great value. It was a cowardly leaving of wife and children to bear a burden he found too great for himself. Linda's thankfulness that they were not, after all, called to endure the ills of actual poverty, was more than words could express. But the worst part of her trial-her mother's strange, un, natural state-still remained. Mrs. Regan went about, attending to her household duties as usual, but in a dull, 'mechanical way, seldom     speaking, and wearing such a sad, weary, hopeless look, as it almost broke her daughter's heart to see. It was impossible to rouse her out of her melancholy, or to excite in her the slightest interest in their plans. She seemed to turn a deaf ear to all her brother-in-law could say, seldom making any answer beyond yes and no; and the most Linda could get from her was a gentle "Do as you please, dear." Linda's plan--her ardent wish-was to stay in the old home, retaining the farm and cultivating it herself, with the help of hired laborers. IBut her uncle scouted the idea: "He was much too young," he said; " and even had she been older, farming was no business for a woman. He would ad- vise that the farm should be rented, or sold outright; they could then live upon the proceeds; she and the chil- dren might board in Thornton, or live in rented rooms, if she preferred it, and it might be a good thing for her to take a school, her- education fitted her for it; and their means were not so ample that a little addition would come amiss." "But, uncle, that would never do; because it'would take me so much away from  mother," replied Linda, decidedly. There was no one in the room but themselves, Mrs. Regan being just then engaged in putting the little ones to bed. Mr. Regan was silent for a moment, fidgeted in his chair, rose and walked twice across the room, then pausing in front of Linda, cleared his throat and began. "Ah, my dear, Hyou cannot have helped seeing-can't surely shut your ' ' eyes to-to the sad fact that my good sister-in-law, your mother, is-ah, a- a little wrong in her mind. I've con-   sulted Dr. Scott about her, and he agrees with me that-that it would be very advisable to-to send her away for a time to --" "To a lunatic asylumI " cried Linda, starting to her feet with flushed face, and eyes flashing with indignation. "Say it out plainly. I know what you mean; but let me tell you, sir, that never, never, no, never while I live to protect her, shall my dear mother be d ragged away to such a prison!" "But, child, prison is not the right name for it; and you don't- consider that it may be for her good." "For her good to be torn away from the children who are all that she has left to love, and whom she clings to with such fond affection? For her good to be deprived of her liberty, torn from her home, shut up in a prison cell, made to eat, drink and sleep in obedience to the orders of her jailors; forbidden to see, or hear from her loved ones, except by their permission? All this for her good indeed I I know it would kill her in a month, and I will never consent to it; never suffer her to be torn away from me. I shall watch over her, and do all that a daughter's tenderest love and care can do to make her comfortable and happy while we both live." She finished with a passionate burst of weeping. Mr. Regan was nettled. 'He was a man who could ill brook contradiction or anything like resistance to his will, where he thought he had the shadow of a right to rule. "Linda," he began again, in a rather stern tone, "I'r ashamed of you. I had no idea of the violence of your temper. You forget that you are not yet of age, and,therefore, still under" authority; and that I might insist --" She interrupted him almost fiercely.   "Of age, or not of age, Uncle James, I shall defend my mother from such a fate while I can raise a finger. Before I would let her be torn away from me, I'd shoot down the first man that dared lay a hand on her!" "Hoity, toity, miss! I begin to think you're pretty nearly ready for such an institution yourself. But con- sider that I, as your nearest living male relative --" "You're not a bit nearer to me than Uncle Aubrey; not half so near to mother. I'll appeal to him. I'll write to him before I close my eyes this night." "Your Ulncle Aubrey I What can he do for you, pray? A helpless, useless cripple, himself dependent on others, is he not?" "A cripple? Yes; but, not depen- dent in the sense you mean. Why, he's acknowledged to be a man of power- ful intellect, he has gained a wide repu- tation as an author, and is growing rich by his profession. As to his help- lessness, his wife is hands and feet to him, he says. I think you would find it a bad business for you to attempt to shut up his only sister in a lunatic asy- lum -without his knowledge or con- sent." "He don't seem to have. interested himself in you of late, anyhow. I haven't heard of any -letters from them." "No, they have not heard. Mother has not been able to write, and Hoh, I felt as if I couldn't write out that- that awful story I But I'll do it now;- I must, I will for her sake. They gave us the tenderest, most loving sympathy when Aubrey was taken away." Mrs. Regan's entrance put an- end to the conversation, but' Linda did not forget her promise, or fail in its per- formance. She Persuaded her' mother   to retire early, her uncle did the same, and thus left alone by the fireside, she took out her writing materials, and penned an epistle over which she dropped many a scaldingtear. It was eloquent of love and grief, and the next morning was speeding on its way to those who would not turn a deaf ear to its appeal. CHAPTER   XIII. W  HAT a pleasant room was that in which Mr. Falconer reclined in his easy chair! A wing had been ad- ded to the house, giving them another chamber: this room, which they called the library, and a small conservatory, opening out fromn it, and now filled with beautiful plants, flowers, and singing birds, Handsome furniture, a harmonious blending of colors in car- pet and curtains, books and pictures, added their attractions; while a deep bay window, in which his chair was placed, gave the invalid a view both up and down the road, and a lovely pros- pect of the river and the hills and forests on its farther side. Ezra had just driven up to the gate, and now Lilian came from the bedroom in bonnet and sacque, and with a thick, warm shawl thrown over her arm. "I'll not be gone very long, dear," she said, to her husband, " not over ail hour, I hope. What shall I do for you before I go?" "Nothing, thank you, wife. But come here for a moment, will you? See what a beautiful blending of light and shade on the hills yonder, and how the river sparkles just there where the rays fall on it." "Yes, it is charming. What a bless- ing is sight!" "Indeed it is. What cause for grati-     tude I have that mine has been spared me. And my hearing also. How sweetly your canary is singing; and how far sweeter to me is the sound of your dear voice, my Lilian." "A lover still, Aubrey, after ten years of married life!" There was more pleasure than mirth in the low, silvery laugh with which she stooped to touch her lips to his. "More in love with you every day, darling," he answered; "without you life would be to me a very dreary waste. Ah, dearest, it is my constant prayer that I Inay never know it by experience, never outlive you!" "And mine that we may be taken together. I don't know how I could endure to leave you, or to let you, leave me. But I must; hasten away, that I may get, back the sooner. Shall I give you a book? or paper and pencil?" "Neither, thank you, I am inclined to meditate--propose thinking out the next chapter of the book, and setting your pencil at Fork as soon as you return." "Oh, I shall be very glad. I, am so mnuch interested in your story, as you know. Well, I must leave you. Debby will be in now and then to know if you want anything." "You 'will go to the post-office?" "Oh yes, of course." "I hope there will be a letter from Adah or her daughter. We have not heard for so long that I am growing really uneasy." "Yes, I hope 'there will be; if not, I must write at once. Good-.bye." "Good-bye, wife. The wind sounds cold; put that shawl round you while you are riding." "Yes, I shall do so. Adieu, adieu!" She kissed her hand playfully to him as she turned to close the door behind. her.   He watched for her reappearance in the path leading to the gate, and fol- lowed her with loving eyes as she ran down it, and with the assistance of Ezra's hand, climbed to a place by his side. Lilian did her errands at the post- office and the stores, then made a call at her Tncle Lambert's. She found her aunt at home, and very glad to see her. "I was just thinking about you," she said, "and wanting a sight of your pleasant face so much, that I had half made up my mind to put on my bonnet and shawl and walk out to your house, inviting myself to dinner." "O, I wish you would. I'm going to walk back, and should be delighted to have such good company. I'm sorry I can't offer you a ride; but Ezra has gone on to the Bend, andl wont be back till towards night." "I would quite as lief walk; it's such a pleasant day, and the roads are good. But can't you take off your bonnet and stay. with me till Ezra comes back?" "Thank you, but you know, I don't often leave Aubrey so long; and I'm particularly in haste to get back to him to-day, because I have a letter, here for him, from his niece, Linda Regan. He was hoping there would be one, for he has not heard. from -his sister for several months, and is grow- ing very anxious about them." "Then we'll set off at once, if you are rested. I'll run up and put on my bonnet and shawl," As they drew near to the farmhouse, Mrs. Lambert said to Lilian, "Now, my dear, you will; of course, wish to read your husband's letters to him: and while you are doing so, the pre- sence of a third party will not be de- sirable, So I shall give Debby a call.   I want some receipts from her, and to learn exactly how she makes that beau- tiful soap of hers-it is always so much whiter and harder' than any we can succeed in making at ouli house." Lilian acquiesced with thanks, and they parted in the hall-the one going out to the nleat kitchen, where Debo- rah was getting dinner, the other into the library, where her husband anx- iously awaited her coming. "Yes, I have brought you the coveted prize," she said, holding Linda's letter up to his view. "I'll read it the first thing, shall I not?" "Yes, do, my dear. I hope it brings no ill news. Did you enjoy your walk? It has given you a fine color." "Very much, thank you. Aunt Maria clame with me, and will come in to see you presently." She was tearing open the envelope. "Why, what is this!" she cried, as she glanced down the page. "Oh, horrible, horrible!" and it fell from her trembling hands, while all the color faded out of her cheeks, and her eyes filled with tears. His cheek paled too, and his voice was tremulous with anxiety and dread as he asked, "O wife, what is it? What hew calamity has befallen? Try to calm yourself, and let me know the worst." "It might have been worse, love; yet it is very, very dreadful," she said, dropping on her knees by his side, and leaning her head against his shoulder, 'while she held the open sheet so that he could'read it with her. Linda told the story of her father's fearful end as briefly as, possible; but dwelt at some length on her mother's sad state, and her Uncle Regan's wishes in regard to her, earnestly entreating her Un'cle Aubrey to use all his influ-:   ence to prevent them from being car- ried out. "She is not insane, I am sure," wrote the loving daughter. "She is only, oh, so sad and weary! Worn out with her long years of toil and trial-most of all the continued dropping (of bitter words) that would wear away a stone; heart-broken by her repeated bereave- ments (she has never gotten over Au- brey's death, nor Oscar's either, I think), and horror-stricken by this last, sudden, and terrible act in the drama of her unfortunate married life. And she clings with the most devoted, ten- der affection to the three of us who are left. Could it do her good to be torn away from us and shut up in a prison. arnolg strangers? O  Uncle Aubrey, your love her, I'm sure you do, and you wont, oh, you wont, let them do it? I believe it would make her what they say she is, only far worse, and that she would die of grief in a very little while. Dear uncle, please write at once, and save her and us!" His face was very pale and stern as he finished this touching appeal. "My sister in a mad-house I Never, no, never! Oh, for the power to move like other men, that I might, go this instant to her rescue. My poor, weary, heart-broken Adah! Lilian, Lilian, my wife, what can be done for them?" "Let us bring them home at once." "Here? Bless you for the thoughtj love; but I fear it would add greatly to your cares and labors." "Possibly; but what of that, my husband? Was I put into the world to seek my own ease and comfort? No, I am sure not; and yet if I consulted only my own pleasure, I should still say, 'let them come to us.' I long to pour some oil into the wounds of that poor, weary one,'so dear to you, my heart's idol, and to take that dear, no,     ble Linda to my arms. And then the little ones I O Aubrey, how their pres- ence will brighten our home, bright and happy as it is already!" "We have room enough, I think." "Plenty; we may have to crowd them a little this winter, if other friends should come to visit us; but next sumi- mer we can add a wing to the other side of the house; it would improve its appearance, and make it abundantly roomy for us all." "Then, dear wife, write at once- there ought to be no delay-asking them to come to us immediately." "Yes, at your dictation," she an- swered, rising and opening her writing- desk, which stood on a little table near at hand; "and I will see that it gets to the office before the next mail goes out." "The thought was yours, dear, and so is the house; should not the invita- tion come principally from you?" She blushed deeply, and there was a pained look on her face, as she went to his side, and laying her hand on his shoulder, said, "I know you did not mean them so, my husband, yet I feel. your words like a reproach. Have I kept anything back from you? I am yours, and so is all that I have. I would not have it otherwise; we are one, and can have no separate interests -know no mine and thine. . Besides," she added, with a proud and loving smile, "so far from being a dependent upon his wife's bounty, my husband makes far more by his pen than I do with my farm-our farm." "Forgive  me, dearest," he said; "though I was very far from meaning to reproach you-as you have never given . me the slightest reason to do. You ,-have never by word or look reminded me that the house or anything in or about it was more yours than mine.   'We will make this a joint letter. I shall dictate a few lines, and then, if you please, you will add something more in your own name." She wrote rapidly, and when the let- ter was finished, read it aloud to him. Such, a warm, tender, loving letter as it was! It could not fail to carry great joy and consolation to the poor, trou- bled, anxious one to whom it was ad- dressed. "Come, come at once to us, dear child," wrote Lilian, " our hearts and home are open to receive you all, and we are longing to have you with us- you yourself, your dear suffering mo- ther, and the precious little ones. I hope we shall be able to make you all happy, and I think it will add to our, happiness to have you with us. How often your uncle and I have said to each other, that the sweet prattle and bright faces of little ones were, all that was lacking in our happy home; and oh how he has for years longed for the sight of his sister's loved face. Come, then; come home as soon as you possi- bly can.   The weather is- growing colder, and you ought to have your journey over before the winter sets in." Lilian now summoned her aunt, and the story was quickly repeated to her. She was deeply interested. "That child ought to have an escort," she said, "she is young to undertake such a journey with such a charge, and probably having had little or no expe- rience in travelling. Ah, something has just occurred to me! Your uncle, Lilian, has been rather out of sorts of late, and the doctor wants'him to take a trip. I think I can persuade him to OgO on for these poor children and their mother." / "The very thing," said Aubrey. "I don't know any one to whose care I would sooner entrust them.  And it   \woutld lay me under lasting obligations to hll." "Me, too," said Lilian. "Oh, if he only'will! And I know he will if he can, for no one has a kinder heart." "That is true," answered the wife. "I have not much doubt of gaining his consent, and if I do, shall let you know at once, and you can write to your niece to expect him." I Mrs. Lambert returned home shortly after an early dinner, and sent back word by Ezra that her husband would go for the Regans. "Relations o' yours, Mr. Falconer?" Ezra ,remarked, inquiringly, on deliv- ering his message.  "Yes; my sister and her three chil- dren." "A widow lady, sir?" "Yes. But, Ezra, do me the favor never to mention Mr. Regan to them, or in their presence. Mrs. Falconer will explain why at another time." "All right, sir. And they're com- ing to make their home with us? I'm right glad of that. It's always a plea- sure to me to have the young Danas around; young folks seem somehow to brighten up a place so. But I must go andS'tend to my cattle." He withdrew, and Mr. and Mrs. Fal- coner fell into a long talk about the past and the future of the Regans. "Your brother-in-law was never a favorite with you, I believe?" re- marked Lilian. "I liked him very well at the time of Adah's marriage, supposing him to be quite a clever fellow. But I soon discovered my mistake, and learned that a man has it in his power to make his wife very wretched-her life bitter with hard bondage--without ever so much as raising his hand against her. I don't think David Regan ever stooped to that, and yet so unhappy did he   make my sister, that I cannot restrain a feeling of joy at her release-shocked and horrified as I certainly am at the manner of his death." "Do you think he was in his right mind when he committed the crime?" "Crime?" he said, musingly. "Yes, that is the right word for it. i'Thou shalt not kill.' It is not added, 'your neighbor,' and we haye no more right to take away our own life than that of another. Think of the hardihood of the wretch who dares to rush unbidden into the immediate presence of his Maker-the King of kings-a crime punishable by death, when committed against the absolute monarchs of the East. "Yet," he added, in a tone tremu- lous with emotion, "I dare not judge too hardly those who have been guilty of it, as though I were proof against the temptation; for, dearest, there was a time when I, shrinking in weak cow- ardice from the heavy trial God had sent me, should have taken my own life, if I had had the power to do so." "O Aubrey, my husband!" she murmured, clinging to him with tears in her eyes, and a look of mingled ter- ror and tenderest love and pity on her face. "Thank God that you did not. I think I should have gone mad, or died of a broken heart." "It was my utter helplessness that saved me, for the time," he said, with deep humility; "and then, dearest, your precious love soon made life not only endurable, but sweet." Neither spoke again for some mo- ments. Then he said, "But I did not answer your question. Some one has advanced the opinion that suicide is never committed by a sane person, and is, therefore, of itself sufficient evidence of aberration of intellect. This may be a correct view of the sub-     ject, but I doubt it. I think I was as sane at the time I spoke of, as I am now. As for my brother-in-law, I do not know what other proof of insanity he may have shown." "I have sometimes questioned with myself whether -considering that in most cases there is no opportunity for repentance after the deed is done -sui- cide may not be the unpardonable sin." "That I cannot decide; but we know  there is no forgiveness for unrepented sin." " have heard suicide spoken of as a brave deed. I do not think it so." "Nor I; when a man takes his own life, he certainly chooses, what seems to ]him the lesser of two evils. Is there ally great courage in that?" "There's a  knock," said Lilian, starting up. "Debby is getting tea, so I will go to the'door." She went, and  returned  the -next  moment, ushering in ler Uncle Lam- bert. He had come, he said, to take tea with them, and to receive from Aubrey full instructions in regard to what he would have done for his sister and her children. "I purpose starting to-morrow," he said, " unless you see some reason why it would be advisable to delay a little s longer." "' No, oh no; the sooner the better, I o think, if it is .quite as convenient for s you." "Quite; so that matter is settled. w And now for your instructions."   6 Mr. Falconer gave them, and also a  check for an amount fully sufficient to u cover all the expenses of the removal. a, What a   pleasure -it was to him to be x able to do that!  ,          tl   IS , n     . CHAPTER XIV. So y LINDA walked into the village and posted her letter to her Uncle A-u- h .brey with her own hands. 'It was not n her way to trust an -errand of much r importance to other people, or to delay [- where prompt action seemed advisable. "There was an early morning mail, and v in order to catch it, she rose betimes 1 and took her walk before breakfast. "What, out walking before your s milking's done?" said Mr. IRegan, meeting her at the gate. "That's not wliat I call good management; your cows should always' be, attended to the first thing." "I had, an errand, and mother knew and approved: of my attending to it first," answered the young girl, some- what haughtily; for she thought it was a matter in which he had no call to in- terfere. "What was it, pray?" "To mail a letter I wrote last night." "To Mr. Falconer?" "Yes, sir." "And you complained of my plans in regard to your mother?" "I told the simple truth, sir." "Very well, miss; since you have seen fit to reject my advice, defy my authority, alnd appeal from it to tliat of another, I wash my hands of all re- sponsibility in regard to you and your affairs. I shall go home to-day, and we shall see how you will manage with- dut me." "Use your own pleasure about that, uncle; you are welcome to stay or to go, as you like; but my conscience acquits me of any wrong in what I have done," returned Linda; stepping past him into the house. He kept his word, and took his de- parture shortly after breakfast.   No one seemed to regret it, and Linda rejoiced in a new sense of freedom, spite of the load of care and responsi- bility that almost weighed her down. Her uncle had been gone scarcely an hour, when their neighbor, Mr. Price, called in. "Well, I hear Mr. Regan's cleared ouit a'ready," he remarked, taking off his hat and seating himself before the fire, "and I come over to see if there wasn't somethin' I could do for ye. 'Taint no ways handy for women folks to get along by themselves on a farm; and my old woman she says, if such an arrangement would be agreeable like to ye, she'll send one o' the boys over pight and mornin' to feed the stock; and he can take his pay in milk. You've got a fresh cow, you know, and ourn's pretty nigh all dried up." "Oh, thank you!  That will do nicely," said Linda. "I don't care to have so much milk to take care of. Don't you think it will be a good plan, mother?" ",What, child? Yes, I s'pose so," 'answered, Mrs. Regan, absently, look- ing up for an instant from the bread she was kneading. Mr. Price sat thinking for a moment, -with his eyes on the floor; then lifting them to Linda's face, said, abruptly, "Don't think I'm a tryin' fur to pry into your affaiirs, Lindy; -'taint that,  it's business I'm after. I jist want to know if you mean to sell the 'farm, or to rent it out, or what?" I've written to my uncle out West, Mr. Price, to know what he advises, and I can't make any arrangement till I hear from him." "H'm! Well, I don't know but I mout as well speak right out. I want it for my Johnnie. MHe's goin' to marry and settle down pretty soon, and -we'd like to keep him near us. Now, if   'twould suit, lie might take and work it on the shares, and you and your folks could stay and keep a part o' the house, or else go off somewheres else, if you chose. What d'ye say?" "That if we conclude to rent it, I should be very glad to secure so good a tenant. But, as I have just said, I must hear from my uncle before I can decide definitely upon anything." "All right; but in case you do con- elude to rent or to sell, you'll give us the first chance, wont ye?" "Yes; I can certainly promise that much to an old friend and neighbor like yourself, Mr. Price." "Thanks; and I am a friend to you, Lindy, that's a fact. And don't you be downhearted, child; you'll be took care of, all o' ye; not a doubt of it; the farm's a valuable one, and in prime order, and will fetch a good price, whether it goes for rent or for sale." This conversation and the good offi- ces of these kind neighbors helped to keep up Linda's strength and courage till the longed-for answer to her letter came. Another, tellifig of Mr. Lam- bert's kind intentions, and that she might look for him in a-day or two at farthest, had been mailed on the same evening with the first, and arrived at the same time. They brought great joy to the whole family; even Mrs. Regan being in a measure roused out of her melancholy at the ,thought of so soon seeing the brother she loved so dearly.  They lost not an hour in beginning their prepa- rations for the journey. "Don't wait to make up a large sup- ply of clothing," Lilian wrote; "your sewing can be done after you get here, and we can furnish all the help with it you may need." "How good she is," said Linda, "So, mother, it need not take us very     long to get ready; we have each a Sun- day dress that will do to put on when we get there, and a second one that will be plenty good enough- to travel in. Don't you think so?" "Yes; I'll leave it to you to decide all that, child; only let me get to my poor brother as soon as possible." - The next day brought Mr. Lambert. He and- Mr. Price soon came to a mlutual understanding in regard to the farm, etc. Mr. Price rented it for his son, and bought the stock and most of the furniture, just as it stood. That saved time and trouble, and the little party were soon on their way westward. They could not leave their old home and the grayes of loved onps, and bid farewell to kind friends and neighbors without many a pang of regret.- It was a dark, cheerless December day, too, on which they set forth upon their journey, and for a time sadness and gloom seemed to be the predominant feelings in the hearts of both mother and eldest daughter. But Mr. Lambert was the most genial and entertaining of travelling companions; the little ones were full -of eager curiosity and delight at every- thing they saw, and their cheerfulness soon proved quite contagious. "You may find your journey cold and fatiguing, ladies," observed their escort; "but I can assure you of a warm welcome, and a good resting time at the end." "And that will more than make amends," said Linda. "But, O Mr. ' Lambert, I don't feel like complaining of the journey with you to take care of us; it is so much better than I had any right to expect." It was late in the afternoon of the  second day that they reached Chilford. There Ezra awaited them with a large sleigh and plenty of buffalo robes to   protect them from the cold. And now a few moments of swift gliding over the snow, to the merry music of sleigh bells, brought them to the farm-house gate. Lilian met them at the door, took each in turn into a warm embrace, then led them to the library where the still form of her husband reclined in- his easy 'chair; outwardly calm and quiet, but inwardly burning with im- patience to meet and welcome his loved ones; and chafing sorely against the fetters that held him in their iron grasp, nor would suffer him to make one movement toward the dear sister from whom he had been so long sepa- rated. "Aubrey, O Aubrey, my dear, dear brother!" she cried, running to him, throwing herself upon his breast, and clinging, weeping about his neck. "Adah, my poor Adah, my darling sister!" he murmured. "Oh, if I could but put my arms about you, and clasp you to my heart for one moment!" "And you can't? Oh, my poor brother, how hard it must bel I never fully realized it before." And she wept anew. When she had taken her bonnet off and he caught a full view of her face, he was scarcely less'shocked at the alteration he perceived in her. She ,seemed but the ghost of the pale, care- worn woman he had left twelve years before; though even she was sadly changed from the blooming young creature David Regan had led to the altar. Lilian saw that he was deeply moved, and her heart yearned overthem both. She led her guests to their rooms; such pleasant, airy, cheerful apart- ments, so tastefully and neatly fur- nished; so well warmed and lighted,   and altogether so attractive that they spoke a welcome of themselves. "I will leave you here for a few moments, to make yourselves comfort- able," she said. "Ezra has brought up your trunks, I see. Debby will have a good hot supper ready for you in half an hour. Ah, here she is with a cup of tea for you now, sister. "Well, I will go down, leaving you all to follow whenever you are ready. Please remember that you are at home." "How sweet and kind she is," cried Linda, as the door closed on her aunt. "'She is that; and you'll find her always the same," returned  Debby, taking the empty cup   from  Mrs. Regan's hand, and acknowledging her thanks by a nod and smile. "If you don't find it pleasant here, 'twont be her fault, nor Mr. Falconer's neither. He's the patientest creetir-.poor, dear man! and so wonderful smart. Just to think offhim amakin' up books-to say nothin' o' newspapers and maga-  zines-and  all out o' his own head. X But I must hurry back to the kitchen, 1 for I've got cakes in the oven."  ] And she made a hasty exit.    T Lilian had gone back to the library, i and was standing beside her husband's a chair, looking down  pityingly at his v pained, troubled, anxious face. ,  * "I am so sorry for you, dearest; my i heart aches for you, and for her too," a she murmured, leaning over him, and r softly passing her hand over his hair, v in a way that was very soothing to him. i: "But remember that she is very weary d with her journey now. I trust she will look and feel much better to- J morrow." "Thanks, love; what a   comforter n you have ever been to me!" he an- n swered, lifting his eyes to her face b with a  sorrowful, but sweet and very o fond smile.            h 7   y   "Will you take your supper now?" she asked. v . "Yes; let her be spared, for to- t night at least, the pain of noticing my p utter helplessness at the table." "We will spare her all we can. But your patience and cheerfulness under ) your sore trial will go far toward help- ing her to bear it with resignation. iHer own too, perhaps; for--much as I  pity her-I cannot think her cross ' heavier than yours. , But you will Igive us your company while we eat?" "Oh, yes; and try to be cheerful too. I want to do my share toward making it pleasant for them here. But as for my patience and resignation, wife, I fear they are very small. I have felt to-night, and often, often before, as if I could not endure to be so bound; as if I must burst these fetters and be free. Ah, if I were but as submissive and gentle as you are!" "You are, to the full. You don't know how rebellious I  have often felt about it, and do still, at times; there will come over me such an inepressible longing to have you open your arms to me, and clasp me close to your breast: it seems so hard that you cannot," she answered, in a voice low and tremulous with emotion.  "I have sometimes said to myself, 'There is Florence who fairly loathes such demonstrations of affection from her husband, and yet might have them  lavishly bestowed upon her, if she would; while I, long- ing so intensely for them, must forever do without.'" "No, dearest, not forever; I shall be free in heaven." "Happy, happy thought!" she mur- mured, putting her arms about his neck, and laying, her head on his breast for a  moment, while two tears, of mingled joy and sorrow, rolled down her cheeks.     He pressed his lips to her forehead' again and again, murmuring words of deep tenderness. Then for' a little they were both silent and still; he resting his cheek upon her soft, brown hair, while her arms still clasped him in a close em- brace; and then she rose up, brought him his supper, and fed him with her own hand. A service of love she per- formed three times every day; never feeling it a task or a burden, but rather -a sweet privilege; so wonderfully does love lighten labor. , How different was the moral atmos- phere of this home from that of the one in which Linda Regan had grown up; never a loud, angry, or unkind word; no niggardliness, but a noble and generous hospitality equally as far removed from ostentation and display. It was almost like getting into an- other world; and the young girl would have been very happy could she but have forgotten the terrible tragedy of the month before, and seen her mother restored to health and strength of body and mind, -But that was not to be. The excite- ment of the journey, and the meeting with her brother had had some effect in rousing Mrs. Regan out of her melancholy; yet the improvement was but slight, and she was still far from being her old self. The weary, care- worn look of hopeless sorrow seldom left her face. Gentle and patient she always was, but usually sad and silent too; and with a far-off yearning ex- pression in her eyes that pained the hearts of those who 1oved her; though she never complained except that she would sometimes murmur to herself that she was "tired, oh, so tired, and v '. wanted rest." Yet it was not physical weariness- at least not after she had recovered   from the fatigue of her journey-for she would not content herself without constant employment with her needle, or some work about the house; though often assured that there was no neces- sity for such exertion, and tenderly entreated to refrain from making it. The little ones, too young for care or anxiety, and so but slightly trou- bled about the change in their mothel -seeing she still cared for and caressed them-and having with them all they loved on earth, were very gay and happy in this new home; where all petted and fondled them. All but poor, dear Uncle Aubrey, who lacked the power to do so, yet managed to make his affection evident enough, and to win a very large share of theirs. He had many pairs of hands and feet at his service now, and was never left alone, unless by his own request. Wife, sister, and nieces vied with each other in their attentions to him; yet there were some services that Lilian would never resign to any one-; nor was he willing that she should. She continued to be his principal amanu- ensis, though Linda occasionally wrote a letter for him. He had his hours for composing, when all but his wife were shut out of his room.. Then, if no household duty de- manded their attention, Mrs. Regan and Linda betook themselves to their own apartments, where they plied their needles, and thb latter acted as govern- ess to her little sisters. Mr. and Mrs. Falconer never re- gretted their deed of kindness in giving a home to the widow and fatherless, never felt that' they had reason to do so. ' The little ones were, like -all chil- dren, sometimes naughty and trouble- some, yet did add to the brightness and cheeriness of the house, and with their   warm, true, childish affection, more than made -amends. Also, it grieved Aubrey and Lilian to look, day by day, upon the sad face of their sister; but they were glad to have her with them, that they might speak words of comfort and consola- *tion, telling her of a rest for the weary and heavy laden; a present rest, to be found in One who so sweetly and ten- derly invites all such to come to Him; and that eternal rest fromn sin and sor- row and suffering, which He gives to His beloved in that better land beyond the tomb. She found Him at last--when she had been with them more than a year -then fell peacefully asleep, murmur- ing words of hope, and love, and joy. And they laid her to rest in the quiet village church-yard, where the tall grass waved, and flowers bloomed, and the little birds twittered and Warbled all througli the long, bright summer days. Linda sorrowed for her own and her sisters' loss, but at length grew comforted in the thought'that the dear mother was no longer weary, careworn, or sad, but revelling in light, and joy, an/d love; while in the uncle and aunt who had so generously opened to them their hearts and home, her children had found kind, wise, loving, and ten- der parents. CHAPTER' XV.      * T-W HY, Milly Dana, is that you? Up before the sun!" Yes, that's nothing new. I always. share papa's early breakfast, and we often take a long walk before it. I delight in seeing the sun come up out of the lake."   "But you can't see that here; so come back to bed. If you don't, you'll be half starved before breakfast." "Not I. You take it at six or half- past, don't you?" "On ordinary occasions; but to-day it's to be at eight to suit your mother. So you may safely indulge in another nap." "But I don't want it; and if I find myself in danger of starvation, I'll apply to Debby for relief. We're old friends, and she'll not refuse me. But Nellie, just come here and look at the wreaths of mist rising from the river and rolling up the hillsides; they look so pretty; Now, don't they?" "Yes, they do," answered Nellie, getting out of bed, and coming to the side of her friend, who, in her white night dress, and with unbound hair, straying in rich, glossy brown tresses over her shoulders, was on her knees before the open window. "It's going to be a lovely day, and I'm so glad." "So am I. Papa says he never saw a  lovelier than it was twenty years ago. Twenty years! just think of it. What a long, long while for people to have been married.  And Lucian was nineteen in the spring, and I'm in my seventeenth year. Mamma says she can't bear to have us growing up so- it makes her feel so old; but papa says he is very glad, because we are becom- ing quite companionable; and in two years more he will take Lucian into partnership in the business." "Aunt Lilian says it doesn't seem a long time to her since her wedding day-they have been such happy years -and Uncle Aubrey say-s the same. And the ten that we've been here have been very happy to us-except when mother 'died." "They've been as good as a father and mother to you?"     -"Yes, indeed, always-; to all three of us." "And what good times we've had together, here and at our house." "Splendid!" "There's the sun; let's dress and take a walk, if we can get out of the house without disturbing anybody." "I think we can by going down the back staircase. Ezra and Debby are pretty sure to be up now, and aunt and uncle will be too, before long." "And, there, I hear Linda and Lily talking, so mamma is probably the only one still asleep in the house." "Your father and brother, per- haps." "No, 'for there they go, down the road. How I wish we were with them."  "'Well, suppose we walk in the same direction, in 'time to meet them as they come back. But I must first run in and ask Linda if I'll be -needed. There's a good deal to be done to-day, you know." "What? Can't I help about soime- thing?" "  O Milly, you're a fine young lady, and not used to work," returned her friend with a good-humored laugh.& "But I'd like to learn; papa wants me to, and I'm going to coax Debby to give me some lessons in cake mak- ing, and so forth." "She'll be very willing; but Linda could do it just as'well, and I nearly. She and I were busy all morning yesterday making cake and pies, and they look delicious, if I dp say it my- self." She ran into the next room, but was back again in a minute. \"Linda says I can go for an hour. * I'll not be needed before breakfast for anything more than to put this room in order. After there'll be a-little   sweeping,- and then \the ice cream making." "Why, do you make it yourselves?" "Yes, we can't get it half so good in town; and for my part, I enjoy the fun.," "So should I. ;You must let me help."         ,     ; "Maybe." The Danas had come to spend the twentieth anniversary of their joint wedding day with the  Falconers. There was to be a family reunion; all  the relatives in Chilford coming out to the farm to take dinner and tea; and for several days past quite grand preparations: for the coming festival had been going on in Deborah's do- main. But Lilian, still devoting herself to her helpless charge, had taken small part in them, except in the way of giv- ing advice, and permission to the young people to do all that was in their hearts to celebrate the day. Aubrey was engaged in the comple- tion of a work which had cost him years of mental toil. His best book Lilian thought it; and she had given him great" assistance in making the necessary researches, as well as in the' performance of the manual part of the labor. For months it had filled the hearts and minds of both, and they had sat up late overit the night before; because Aubrey was in the mood for composing, and, they were both eager to reach the end. It had not been reached, however; there were still a few more pages to be written, and Lilian had fallen asleep consoling herself with the thought that the putting of the finishing touches to it would be a very appropriate celebra- tion of the anniversary of their nup- tials. She awoke a little later than usual,   to find her husband lying beside her and gazing into her face with eyes full of admiring, tenderest affection.  She smiled, and raising herself to give him a kiss: "Twenty years, love," she said; " twenty years to-day. What happy years they have been." "Yes, your love has made them so to me. And you have not repented?" "Never for one moment. ,I should be glad to live with you for twenty more. But you would hardly wish to live that long?" "No; and yet life, even in my help- less condition, is not so dreary that I should be greatly troubled at the know- ledge that I must endure it that much longer. Not, at least, while you are spared to me." "I think I shall be spared and given strength to wait upon you as long as you may need me," she said. "And. I think, too, that we shall not be long separated, or either of us live to very old age." For a year past she had noticed that his strength was gradually failing; and she knew (what she had carefully con- cealed from all who loved her-most of all from him) that she bore in her breast the seeds of a mortal disease that might end her life. at any moment. But she had asked that she might live till he no longer needed her loving care, and was calmly and serenely happy in the firm belief that her petition would be granted. "Ah, I must get up," she said; "the sun is peeping above the horizon, and I want you to take your morning tour of the garden while it is cool and plea- sant. I think I hear Nellie and Milli- cent moving about now.   How the young things enjoy being together." She went on talking while attending to the duties of her simple toilet. "Do you feel in the mood for finish-   ing the book? I hope so;' for I do so want to get it done to-day." "What; can't you allow yourself a holiday even on this great occasion? The twentieth anniversary will never come again.'" "No; but what of that? Could we celebrate it in a, better way?" "Perhaps not; but your sister will claim your attention to-day. She is your guest, you know, and you do not often see much of each other." "Florence has a novel on hand that will entertain her better for some hours than I could. I shall devote-the morn- ing to you. After that my guests shall share my attention with you." She gave him his breakfast and his airing, and as she wheeled his chair into its old position on the porch-his fa- vorite resort on pleasant summer days -they were joined by Mr. Dana, his son and daughter, and Nellie Regan. Then Linda and Lily came out, and all together they formed a merry, lively party till the breakfast-bell summoned them to their morning meal. Mrs. Dana joined them at the table She had changed very little in the last twelve years, except to grow older and more self-indulgent. Her manner to her husband was much the same, and his hope of winning her affection had grown very faint indeed. In fact, he -had almost resigned it; but he found great consolation in his children, whom, in his proud, fond, fatherly love, he es- teemed all that heart could wish, while they were as devoted to him now as they had been in the days of their childhood. Breakfast over, Mrs. Dana returned to her novel-begun the day before-- and Lilian to her husband, while Mr. Dana joined the young people, who were making very merry over the pre- paration of their ice cream and other     dainties, and the adornment of the par- lor and dining-room, which they were trimming with flowers and foliage. Everything was accomplished in due season, the guests arrived punctually, and the dinner went off' to the entire satisfaction' of all concerned. Although only a family party, they were quite a large one. Mr. and Mrs. Lamubert, now a hale, hearty old cou- ple, full of genial kindliness; Meta and her husband, a buxonl, happy-looking pair, in the prime of life, bringing ini their train half a dozen or more, of such children as parents have a right to be proud of; all these, added to the Dallnas, the Falconers, and the Regans. Mrs. Dana wore, a rich, light silk; Mrs. Falconer a simple, white muslin. Both seemed in good spirits, gay, and chatty, and their uncle complimented them by saying he thought they were looking nearly as well as on the day the anniversary of which they had met to celebrate. The Lamberts and Griswolds left shortly after an early tea; Mr. Dana took his wife and Linda for a drive; Lucian, his sister, and Nellie and Lily Regan strolled out upon the river bank; and Aubrey and his wife were left alone upon the porch. "Alone here, love, just as we were this same evening twenty years ago," she said, seating herself by his side, with her arm about his neck and her head resting on his shoulder. "Never alone when together, dear- est," he answered, kissing the white forehead, scarcely less smooth and fair than on the evening she spoke of. "What lovely, happy years they have been ; every care and sorrow lightened, every joy increased tenfold by our mu- tutal love and sympathy." "Yes, and in all these years you   * have never spoken one harsh' word to me." "You have never given me the i slightest excuse for doing so; and-what a brute I should have been could I have made such a return for all your love and care." "And you hasve been so patient under your heavy trial, Who could help lov- ing you?"  "You look weary, dearest." "I am, a little;' it has been rather an exciting day." "And I let you work too hard and long last night," he said, a little' re- morsefully. "Oh, no, it was my, own choice; and I am so glad the book is done at last. Now, you will take a rest before you go back to the other, will you not?" "Yes; I need not hurry about fin- ishing it, and I want you to rest and enjoy your sister's visit." A little longer they talked in quiet, subdued tones, then fell to silent mu- sing, while watching the glow of the sunset fading out of the sky. They still- sat there, Lilian's white dress fluttering slightly in the evening breeze, coming fresh and cool from the river, as Mr. Dana and hs party drove up to the gate. Florence and Linda came gaily up the path, chatting and laughing. "Why, how very quiet you two are, Lil," remarked thie former, as she stepped upon the porch and drew' near her sister. There was no answer, no movement. Lilian still sat with her arm about her husband's neck, her head on his shoul- der, while his cheek rested against her hair. A sudden, undefinable terror seized upon Florence. She drew nearer and touched her sister's hand, then recoiled, with a bitter cry, "Oh, she's dead! \   She's dead! Lilian, Lilian!" and fell sobbing on her knees, kissing the cold hand, and chafing it between her own. Linda rushed into the house for re- storatives, while Deborah came hurry- ing from the kitchen, bringing a light with her. It flashed upon two still, white faces, both wearing a sweet, calm, placid ex- pression that seemed to speak of love and joy and peace. "Gone, both of 'em! Gone together, as. I've heard 'em wish more'n once or twice that they might!" cried Debby, with a gush of tears. "Oh, I've been a fearin' it; for I see they was both a wearin' 'emselves with that there writin'." And she was not Inistaken. Their ardent wish had indeed been granted,. and they had passed away to the better land without the pain of separation. "Oh, not both! It can't' be possi- ble!" cried Linda, in a voice of agony.. "Oh, run for the doctor, somebodyI It can't be that they're gone!" Mr. Dana rushed from the house, turned his horses' heads, sprang into the carriage, and drove in hot haste to the village, returning at once with the family[ physician; the others mean- while. using every effort to restore animation; but without success. Dr. Brick's verdict crushed out the last spark of hope. "They are gone," he said, in a tone of quiet sadness; "and I am hardly surprised, except that they should go so immediately together. I knew Mrs: Falconer had .heart disease, and was liable to instant death at any time. And for him, I have long been expect- ing a second stroke of paralysis, and with little doubt that it would prove fatal; probably instantly so. It was, perhaps, hastened by excessive mental exertion and excitement; which, it is ,   very likely, had an equally bad effect upon her. Or it may be, that one was taken first, and the shock killed the other." "I think not," said Mr. Dana, with emotion; "both   look so sweetly, calmly happy." "Ah," said the weeping Linda, "I remember now that aunt has been looking pale of late, and would some- times catch her breath, as if with sud- den pain, and put her hand to her side; but she made very light of it, when any one questioned her about it. She never complained, and was always so cheerful no one could think she was ill. Did she know her disease and her danger, doctor?" "Yes, but wished it kept from her friends." And so Aubrey and Lilian Falconer rested front their labors, leaving be- hind them the' sweet savor of their lovely and pleasant lives. Their adopted children were sorely bereaved by th'e double loss;' yet while grieving for themselves, rejoiced for them--the loved ones gone. Linda was now old enough to take the care of her younger sisters, the property was nearly all left to them; Ezra and Deborah had no wish to leave, and so the home was not broken up. Florence Dana's grief for the loss of her only sister was deep and sincere. She had much time for reflection now, as during her year of mourning she was, of course, hut out from fashion- able society. She seemed ever to see before her those two calm, peaceful, happy faces, and recalling all she had known of them and their married life, she asked of her own heart why it was that Lilian had ever been so much happier, and more beloved than her- self; and slowly, but surely the con- viction came home to her, that it was     because Lilian had lived for others, she for self, and self alone. Then her thoughts turned upon her own husband, and ,as memory brought up before her all his patient love, kindness and forbearance, all her own wilfulness and coldness, her cheeks burned with shame. She first grew to pity, then to admire, and then to love him. She fell to watching him fur- tively, and wishing that he would renew the efforts, he had at length dip- continued, to win some token of affec- tion from her. One evening he sat alone in the library, reading in the twilight, near a window looking out upon the lawn, where their son and daughter were wandering about together. Florence came in and seated herself upon the farther side of the room; but he did not seem to notice her entrance. She watched him for some moments, studying the lines of his face, and won- dering that she had never noticed what a good and ihoble one it was. Not   young, growing rapidly old, yet with a better beauty than that of mere youth -the reflection of a kindly, noble, generous nature. And she had learned beyond a doubt that it was a true index to his heart; he was all that one might hope from his countenance. As she looked, and thought, and re. membered, her love grew apace; grew with wondrous rapidity; she could no longer refrain from letting it be known. Rising with a sudden impulse, she ran to him, and throwing her arms about his neck, "My husband, my dear, dear husband," she murmured, hiding her face on his shoulder, "I have learned to love you at last, to love you dearly, dearly I Is it-is it too late?" He threw downh his paper with a joyful cry, and clasped her to his breast., "Too late, my darling? No, no, oh, no, never too late for that! What have I done that such joy, such bliss should come to me!"
