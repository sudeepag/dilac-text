THE shadows hung deep and dark over "Our Home."  The Angel of Death had folded his funeral wings over the once happy family. The heavy night of his presence had no ray of light. Hearts were breaking. Suddenly the strongest ties of human life had been snapped asunder. Faith was eclipsed in rayless darkness. The enemy of souls was plying his most fearful machinations. All earthly hope was dashed and the " better hope" was not yet " brought in," so that the stricken hearts could " not draw nigh unto God," and, pulsing against his great Fatherly bosom, find strong conso- lation in this the agony of bereavement. THE BABY WAS DEAD. In the darkened room, so silent now, lay the little Herbert - sleeping; yes, sleeping,-but to wake no more, until the trump shall sound, and the dead come forth from earth's great charnel house; when " the corruptible having put on incorruption," and the mortal, immortality, and Death swal- lowed -up in victory;" the redeemed of the Lord shall return unto Zion with singing, and everlasting joy shall be upon  10       Evangel Wiseman. their heads." "They shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away." Oh, transcendent vision of the Seer! as leaping over the ages in which Death should reign, he beheld life and immortality brought to light by the Son of Man, and gazed upon the Apocalyptic of the Nlew Jerusalem " come down to earth out of heaven, from God, with its sapphire walls and pearly gates and streets of gold-its pure river of water, clear as crystal,-its tree of life with twelve manner of fruits, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations, while the glory of God and the Lamb is the light thereof." Would mortals weep, if but their eyes Could pierce the veil that lies between The lower and the upper skies, Where Christ the Lord is seen? But the stricken parents could see no light. Their bowed hearts could not lift their beatings heavenward. Their tear- dimmed eyes saw but their idol wrapped in the death-robe; and as he lay there, ohl so mysteriously, so wondrously beautiful, they beheld in him their every earthly light gone out, their fondest hopes forever dash ed. The tyrant hand of Death had seized their hearts, and ruthlessly torn from its beautiful temple-where so lovingly it had sat enshrined, and before whose burning altar the daily incense of affection- ate adoration had been offered-the image of their darling , boy. And they felt in wordless bitterness-that, hence- 'forth, driven from their beautiful Eden-they must wander hand in hand through the dark, bleak wastes of hopeless despair, until Death should bring them dread relief. Mother, have you felt this unspeakable agony? Father, have you been thus bereft, and left comfortless? If so, you know the depths of human woe. May the loving Saviour   Contrasts.  Death--Life.      " have tenderly whispered to you, "I am the resurrection and the Life." Oh, poor human hearts! Oh, speechless agony I With weight of woe the soul sits down; All joy, all hope forever flown; Man curses God, rebelling, Till, guided by Infinite love, He lifts his heart to heaven above, Its light all gloom dispelling. The glorious sun had kissed the earth. Responsive to the loving greeting, Earth quivered in her every fibre, and woke to joyous life. Teeming mortals trod her courts exultant in glad joy, and canticles of holy hymning went up to the Great Author of good, from unnumbered creatures of His handiwork. Nowhere in all the round of being could be found two more blissful souls than Evangel Vernon and Herbert Wise- man. One brief year had passed since they had plighted loving- troth. And now, amid the bursting joys of the beau- teous spring, they were to be united in that Edenic cycle, whose orbit should be studded with unfading joys. Should not earth sing them joyous epithalamium? The evening of marriage came. In her own happy home in Chester, amidst loving friends, whose smiles had bright- ened her childhood, Evangel and Herbert were joined in holy bonds by the rector of the Episcopal Church, Rev. John L. Cheney. It was an epoch with the Bishop, as well as with those whose'"destinies he had indissolubly united. Twenty years before this he had christened Evangel accord- ing to the rites of his church, and at the age of sixteen she had received the vows of confirmation at his hands. Now ing to the rites of his church, and at the age of sixteen she     12       .Evangel Wiseman. " he had given her to one who was not a believer either in christening, baptismal regeneration, nor confirmation, but who wholly repudiated every cherished dogma of the Estab- lished Church. Herbert Wiseman, horrid to tell, was a Baptist-in sentiment. Every endeavor had been used by her friends and the Bishop to dissuade Evangel from forming such a connection. Precepts and practices had been explained to her; custom and position urged upon her consideration; consequences held up threateningly before her vision; but none of these things moved her;-," she loved Herbert Wiseman and would marry him." "Not one cent of my fortune will I leave you, Evangel,"' said Aunt Delia, a maiden sister of her father, living in the family, " if you persist in marrying this-I was going to say -abominable heretic." "Well, Aunty, I am sorry to displease you, but I think our match must have been made in heaven, and heaven will take care of us," replied Evangel, half playfully, half sadly. "I regret, my daughter," said Mr. Vernon to her one evening, about six weeks previous to the marriage, I that you should have made such a choice. The union of church- men with other denominations is never productive of happi- ness." "But, papa," replied Evangel, as she seated herself beside him on the sofa, "Herbert is not a Baptist-only his parents and his brother William." "He may not be uinited in church relationship with them, but he fully indorses their doctrines and practices, and repu- diates ours. He is very decided, too." "Is this your only objection to him, papa?"  "Yes, my daughter-; in all things else I regard him wor- thy of you."   i.'J:         Contrasts. Life--Death.      13 I- i ? "Ah, well; then never mind that. I think I shall soon enlighten his mind, to ' see the error of his way."' And Evangel laughingly kissed her father, first on one cheek, and then the other, as if to chase away this frightful Euryale from his brain. The Bishop's power had been brought into the family press- ure against the union. He had ever been Evangel's dear friend and adviser, and next to her own honored parents, she loved and respected him. His influence over her had hitherto been unlimited; and whenever she had doubted as to her course, his opinion had always decided her action. But Evangel's love was not " the growth of human will," and could not be trained by human wisdom. Herbert knew the opposition, and chafed under it.. But he loved Evangel too sincerely to allow anything to deter him from making her his wife. She was young, pure, gentle, possessing a highly refined and sensitive nature, with a mind penetrative and compre- hensive, rather characterized by force and depth than brilliancy. She -had always been a favorite with her seniors in years. She was generous to all--one of those charitable dispositions which will not only bestow alms, but which also " thinketh no evil." Herbert was talented, highly educated and manly, and moreover possessed a most commanding personal appear- ance, so that wherever he nidght be, he was the observed. Having honorably graduated at the Law School in Louis- ville, Kentucky, he had settled himself in the thriving village of Chester, where he hoped in the course of time to make for himself a name and a fortune. Evangel llad means. She was the elder of two daughters, the only children of wealthy parents. Herbert was portion- less. Of a highly respectable family in Kentucky, ever     "       Evangel Wiseman. accustomed to mingling with the educated and refined, pos- sessing a noble nature with just perception of the good and beautiful, he was in himself "worthy the hand of the fairest lady of the land." Evangel had won his heart by her womanly nature, her  pure and lofty thoughts, her quick and ardent emotions, her lovely face and charming figure. He loved her for herself. He would have sunk into oblivion before he would have  bartered the true and lofty affections of his noble soul for  gold. AEsthetically he worshiped her, and with her as his wife he felt possessed of all the wealth and happiness this j world could bestow.  "Sister, I do wish my brother Herbert-that is to be-  was not a Baptist," said Lilly, the younger daughter, one  day as she stood by the bedside admiring the many beautiful  articles of the trousseau that had just been received from Madame Duffedand's; "I don't care a fig myself, for if I  were you, I would marry him if he were a Mahometan, he is so handsome and agreeable; but then Papa and Aunt  Delia are so distressed about it." "Not so distressed, Lilly, I hope. Only that they would prefer he were a member of the true church."  Well, I don't know, sis; but I heard them speaking of it last evening on the verandah, while you and Mr. Wiseman  were riding, and I assure you, they seemed to feel badly, both of them, but particularly aunty."  Evangel blushed deeply as she fastened the odorous tea-  rose in her jetty hair, but remained silent. She was thipnking. The wedding passed off as most occasions of the kind usually do. Bridesmaids, groomsmen, all recherchk; the Episcopal marriage ceremony; tears, congratulationsi elab-  orate supper; wit, repartee, promenading, music, dancing,  I-   Contrasts. Life-Death.       15 -a lulling in the gaiety, parting compliments with the happy pair, the host and hostess; departures-the silent house. Evangel's dowry from her father was a beautiful suburban residence, fitted up with perfect taste and elegance. It had been thoroughly furnished and made " comme il faut"' by the wedding-day. And when, a week following the mar- riage, they repaired to its beautiful shades, Evangel said, as she entered the gateway leaning on the arm of her husband, a sweet and trusting wife, "Herbert, this is our home. Here we shall live and love in peace and joy, and may no dark clouds ever shut out the sunshine of happiness." "' Our Home' then it shall be called, for our home it will be; and here, shut in from the world, we shall dwell as happy as in Eden bowers, and from us our friends shall learn that there is one spot on this blighted ball where the trail of the serpent has never been seen." The husband bent over the wife and kissed her, and the two wandered through the grounds beneath the shade of the fine old trees, and amid the laughing flowers; and then they took undisturbed possession of the home in their own name, and after chatting gaily awhile in the parlor, repaired to the dining-room to partake of the supper prepared for them by Bridget Mahoney, the Irish servant. Herbert and Evangel had chosen thus quietly to begin their new life, instead of having to endure all the round of company usual on such occasions. A year passed by. The Angel of Peace encamped round about that dwelling, ever scattering dewy blessings o'er the loving hearts within. Evangel grew each day more dear to Herbert. And to her adoring eyes there was nothing in all the world so pure so true, so noble as her own Herbert. He made her  orld, and she made his. Her music, her     ! '     16       Evangel Wiseman. birds, her flowers, were all for him. Her domestic cares, usually such drudgery to the young housekeeper, were gilded with a halo of glory, for, in all she did, all she plan- ned, she had an eye single to his taste and comfort. His every success in his profession had for its guiding-star the happiness of his own sweet wife. Mr. Wiseman was surely axl rapidly establishing himself in a most commanding and lucrative business. He won the hearts of all by his affable manner and intelligence. His genial nature, high self-respect, combined with his prudent deference for the opinions of others who might differ with him, his magnanimity and undeniable talent, secured the admiration and friendship of all classes in the community. The spring and summer passed. The autumn came and went. Then winter, with his icy breath and hoary locks remained awhile, and quick sped off to Nova Zembla. Again spring violets broke the rime, and crocuses and daffodils flecked with purple and yellow, earth's fresh green covering. Life was busy everywhere-in forest, dell, and shady nooks and on the sunny plains. Her active hands were selecting and combining from earth and air, elements and materials to bring forth " seed to the sower and bread to the eater." And beauty, too, sprung from this life to woo the soul of man from the prosaic to the poetic. What varied an$, inex- haustible provision God has made for the good and happi- ness of His creatures; and yet so obtuse is man by reason of sin, that he neither sees the hand that so lavishly scatters good athwart his pathway, nor hears the mighty voice pro- claiming the love of the Great I Am. "Our Home " was sweetly embowered in the bosom of the grand old trees, with lawn of velvet green and breath of fragrant flowers. The sun threw " golden spots of glory" o'er the varied landswape, and locust-bloom and honey-suckle filled the air with delicious breathings.  Contrasts.   Life-Death.      17 The love of the inmates strengthened and deepened with each waxin( and waning moon. Friends called it a Para- dise, and so it was, as nearly as earthly scenes become. Nor was the Giver of all this wondrous wealth of bliss for- gotten. Herbert Wiseman had been religiously educated-had from his youth been taught the glorious doctrines of the blessed Gospel of the Son of God. He knew that man by sin was lost-had no power to save himself--that the God- man had expiated sin by His death on Calvary, thereby bringing in a full and free salvation for all who would by faith lay hold of the promises through our Lord Jesus Christ. Hle believed iin the Personality of the Holy Spirit- His office-work to lead sinners to Christ-to comfort, en- lighten and guide those who have accepted the righteousness wrought out by Jesus. All this he knew-all this he believed-and yet he "would not come " that he might have eternal life. Endowed with large reverence and faith, entertaining the liigriest respect for religion, he had procrastinated-had put off the seeking that " pearl of great price." It was the daily habit of the two to read the Word of God and to pray before retiring. Herbert would read and explain, as best he could, a portion of the New Testament Scriptures, after which they would kneel and Evangel would read a prayer from the Collects. Thus they sought to do their duty and to step heavenward as sure as they could. But alas, they had not a light -to their feet, for the Sun of Righteousness had not yet illumed -their hearts. They groped in darkness; they struggled on in their weakness. And though they sought to do the will of God they had no peace nor joy "in believing." Like travelers in a dark forest groping their uncertain way without any guidance, I -     18       Evangel Wiseman. these two wandered on and knew not where they were nor whither going. And yet they were happy, very happy in each other's love. Look we for the reflex of heaven here on earth? Where shall we find it, if not in the home of con- tentment and love, where heart understandingly rests on heart, and eyes look the pleasure of the worshiping soul, and lips are attuned to the music of undying affection? It was a sweet, calm May morning when to "Our Home," From out the bowers of Paradise, There' came a being wondrous fair; The look of heaven was in his eyes, Its sunbeams in his hair. "The divine rapture of the first maternal glance," says Michelet so well, "the ecstacy of the young mother; her innocent surprise at having given birth to a soul; her relig- ious emotions in her marvelous dream, which is so real nevertheless-all this may be seen every day, and yet how impossible to paint it!" All this exquisite wonder, this divine emotion, this qut- pouring of soul in the very sublimation of joyous gratitude, were felt and experienced by Evangel,. when for the first time as a mother she gazed on her precious babe in all his strange and marvelous beauty. A halo of heavenly glory surrounded the tender, tiny form, and while she looked she wondered and wept. What fountains of love, what well- springs of joy, what oceans of sympathy, of hope, of expec- tation, burst up from the depths of her soul and overflowed her being I Ah! this mother-moment I What a momentous epoch in a woman's existence! The burst of a life as holy as that of the angels; as deep and intense as the very essence of emo- tion can render it--far-reaching as time itself. Triumphing over all pain, all suffering, it takes hold on the Invisible and   Contrast. Life-Death.       19 !, the Eternal, and stays itself there. In becoming a mother, woman enters upon a sublime life-the very perfection of life. By the pangs of maternity, she rises to an alliance with God. It was a beautiful trio-that father, and mother, and child I "Nature has bound up life within a triple and absolute tie, man, woman, and child. Separately they must perish. They are only saved, together." Great truth speaking through all the ages I Yet, unheeded or not understood by the masses; religiously abjured and set at naught in the name of the Great Author of marriage, by designing men who practice celibacy, claiming therefor the authority of the Gospel, and who make of no effect the express com- mands of divine revelation, substituting for "doctrines " the "traditions of men." The babe was called Herbert, for the father. No other name would satisfy the desire of the loving wife and mother. Each day he grew more dear. He was the very soul of joy, the light of "Our Home," the efflux of unalloyed happiness. The grand-parents smiled in placid contentment, their souls stirred to the deepest depths. Lilly Vernon and her bosom friend, Annie Chiles, declared "that it was just the sweetest thing that ever lived," and Lilly was never weary of looking at the little chubby, careless form tucked away in the cradle, watching its soft breathin'g, the dainty movements of its little hand, or quaint wonder- look of its soft, blue eyes, as unclosing dreamily they would peer out into inanity, as if he would not condescend to look at anything this side heaven and the angels. She made for it all kinds of pretty -things, and was always studying the becomingness of tints. Miss Vernon's maidenly heart was also wondrously stirred by the advent of the little stranger. There was still left     i   20       Evangel Wiseman. I away down in her bosom, sealed up, 'tis true, ever since Lilly stepped out of swaddling-bands, a hidden fountain of maternal love, which now burst forth and welled up until it overflowed in the softest tones, and tenderest looks, and gentlest handling imaginable, and she watched over mother and babe with that beautiful untiring care for which maiden aunts are everywhere proverbial. ' Oh, how I long for the time, Evangel, when this little fellow will be old enough to be baptized," she said to Mrs. Wiseman, as she sat on a low chair opposite the faintly burn- ing fire on the hearth, and toasted the little one's feet by the embers. The mother made no answer, but seemed lost in thought. "Of course you are going to have it done just as soon as possible," Miss Delia continued, with some warmth at the mother's indifference. "I was speaking to Dr. Cheney yes- terday as I came over from home, and he is all anxiety on the subject, He says he can well remember when he admin- istered to you this holy sacrament. Lilly and I have already planned the robe and cap, and brother and sister are looking forward to it with bright anticipation." The mother was silent as she toyed with the blue tassel of her robe-de-chambre. "Why, Evangel, what has come over you, prty; have you lost your hearing, child?" and Miss Delia fixed upon her a searching look as the dawning of the truth began to enlighten her churchly mind. "You are going to have the child baptized, of course you are." "Yes-I suppose so, aunty, but I cannot say positively." ' Suppose so! can't sayI well, who ever heard the like? A Vernon not baptized? It is perfectly preposterous!" and Miss Delia gave her left cuff a terrible twitch, and rubbed her-hands together with marked intensity.   4   Contrast. Life-Death.   21   "But aunty, dear, you know," replied Evangel with her sweetest smile, ' that the baby is not a Ver-non; he is a Wise-man." "He is a Vernon, every inch of him! See, he looks it from head to foot!" answered Miss Delia emphatically, failing entirely to see the facetiousness of Evangel's pun. Just then Bridget Mahoney burst into the room, with her face looking like one of the children's air balloons, her thin hair combed fiercely back and done up in the tightest little screw behind, confined by a solitary hair, pin, while her small blue eyes twinkled with delight as they rested on the" leetle maun," as she had dubbed the babe. Giv 'im me, Miss Daylah. Oh, ye fine maun, ye will soon be reddy for the praste, be shure; how swate an' nice ye'll look, be shure, to recave the holy sacrimint." And Bridget tossed him up and down in her enthusiasm, until Evangel startled from her chair. "Thare now, lay in ye leetle craydle, an' be a gude leetle maun till aunty comes back," she said, as she gently lowered the babe to his soft bed. "Come, Miss Daylah, lets go an' see about supper. He looks swate, be shure," and Bridget crossed herself and rushed to the door, followed by Miss Vernon. Evangel took her seat beside the cradle to think. Weeks passed on. The subject of baptism was frequently introduced by Miss Delia, but as the mother never appeared to favor it, she would not urge its immediate administration, but ever insisted that at no distant day it should be done, to, which Evangel silently consented. Each day the babe grew fairer and dearer. The soul within the pearly casement developed. What flood-tides of bliss swept over the mother's heart as she recognized the unfolding! How she laughed, and played, and sung, teach- ing it what she had first learned from it. And as the little    22       -Evangel Wiseman. one came to know the mother, and saw himself in the mater- nal eye, how instinctively his soul returned her looks of love! What a deathless bond had sprung up to unite the two! In intelligence as well as love the baby-boy was fast un-  folding. He cried at the father's leaving, ard joyed at his' return. He could read the smile-the firown--understand the intonations of his vojice-be amused at his comic entertainments--sob himself to sleep at his displeasure. And baby's antics were ever a source of delight to the loving parents, a Did mistrust and dark forebodings ever thrust their fear- ful shadows over these idolizing hearts? Or did the present fruition entirely fortify against the intrusion of doubt and fear? Did not reason sometimes ask, "Will not the Master have need of our jewel to shine in His crown? Will He not want our chlerub to' sing sweet anthems in the infant cho- ruses of heaven, before the discord of the world shall-mar the pure -tones of his soul's adoration?" Happy in the priceless gift that God had bestowed-unac- quainted with death-how could they realize that little feet, straying away from Paradise, long to return?--that flowers from the Eden above bloom but a little while on earth? Its air is too bleak for them. They fade--they perish! !   ^  I            Under the Rod.         23 CHAPTER II. UNDER THE ROD. VANGEL stood on the steps of the verandah one ( sweet summer's evening awaiting the return of her husband from his daily engagements. She had been practicing Herbert in walking, in which science he was becoming daily more proficient. On the verandah, toddling on in one of his virgin attempts to walk alone, was the little fellow, now fourteen months old, greatly interesting his mother by his manly efforts to reach the end of the portico where the canary bird hung, embowered in the profusion of roses around it. Her eyes, full of tender love and admiration, were earnestly fixed on the little swaying form as it bravely pursued unsteady way to the bird. "Papa comes papa 'comes!" exclaimed the mother, as the click of the' front gate fell on her ear. "Papa comes, Herbert." At this moment the form of Mr. Wiseman appeared from behind the bushes, and the little fellow catch- ing a glimpse of it, left off his pursuit of the bird and turning to reach his mother, fell. Evangel caught him up, and smothering him with kisses tossed him into the out- spread arms of the father. And then, oh my! such a rollicking play as succeeded! You would have thought that ten juveniles of the male gender had just escaped from the restraints of the nursery. The fun and frolic continued until tea-time. When Bridget Mahoney announced supper, the little fellow ca- pered with joy.' Mr. Wiseman seizing him, tossed him up in the air all the way through the hall to the dining-room, and seated him in his high-armed chair, the beautiful gift t ,     -24       Evangel Wiseman. of Aunt Delia when he was a year old. Herbert was run- ning over with delight. He talked his baby talk,-and laughed his broad, free baby-laugh, and clapped- and kicked, and threw the spoons about, and caught at the fly-bush in Bridget's hand, like a veritable mad-cap. "Oh, yee saucy leetle maun," said Bridget, as .,she gently slapped his white, chubby hand as he'd put. it up to reach the bush. "Betther to ate ye supper out o' the bootiful plate Miss Lilly giv ye." "Baby is in high spirits," said Mr. Wiseman, as the little fellow kept up the kicking and clattering, and dashing around. "I don't think I have ever seen him quite so fer- mentative." "He is so happy to see papa," replied the smiling wife, looking so sweet and glad in her pure white muslin, with simple rose-buds for ornaments. "Herbert is glad to see papa," she said, nodding to the baby. With this he bounced up and down more violently, sent the silver knife and fork banging on the floor, upset the cup of milk, and laughed and chatted most furiously. Just at this moment Lilly Vernon and Annie Chiles, who had been taking an evening walk, came bounding into the room. "Oh, you little sprite!" exclaimed Lilly, seizing him and kissing him all over. "Annie, isn't he the ' charming- est child in all the universe?' as Miss Nancy Goodleaf says." "He is sweet. Here, Herbert, give Annie, a kiss, won't you?"' The little fellow put up his dainty mouth, and Annie kissed the cherry lips over and over. "I have just called in, sister, to tell you that Dr. Cheney will be home next Sunday, and--now brother, don't you listen; play with Herbert-several children are to be bap- tized. And ma and pa and aunty say, by all means, you   Under the Rod.         25 must have Herbert ready. It has been postponed too long now. Aunty and Annie and I are going up town to-mor- row to get all that is necessary for the occasion, so you need give yourself no thought about it. We will be over again and make all arrangements." The color flashed to Evangel's face, vieing in hue with the rose in her hair,-her eyes sought those of her husband. He smiled quaintly, but she made no reply. "'You are willing, of course, brother? and Lilly turned from her sister to Mr. Wiseman. He repeated his queer little smile. "Why, what do you mean?" and Lilly stood with a look of surprised disappointment on her face. "Are you not going to have the babe baptized? Next Sunday will be such ,a fitting time! There will be half a dozen others at least, and Herbert is now more than a year old.?' it      Mr. Wiseman kept up the little puzzling smile. "Say, brother," exclaimed Lilly, quite discomfited, "are you not going to have the babe baptized on Sunday?" "I did not-propose to do so," he replied, quietly, the smile still lingering. "Well, won't you let him be, if we will take the matter into our own hands, and not give you any trouble about itP " "I have not so determined. If I conceived it my duty, I should not shrink from any attendant trouble, Lilly.". "Well, well, brother, we will have it all right.. Aunty is coming over to-morrow, and she will see all about it." The little company chatted away gaily, first on one theme and then another, during the tea-hour, after which the girls threw on their hats to hasten home. The babe's bedtime came. "Feel Herbert, dear; don't you think he has some fever? and see how dull he seems." The mother's tones were very Ad     "anxious.     26       Evangel Wiseman. "No, darling, I think not," said the father, passing its hand gently over the hlttle one's forehead and resting his soft hand in his. "He is excited and weary from his romp. Don't you think so?"- "I trust it may be nothing more." The mother looked thoughtful. Instinctively she felt there was something more than fatigue. Soon the babe fell into a deep sleep. Gently, with a mother's magic touch, she removed the little white dress, pink slippers, coral necklace and bracelets, birthday gifts from loving friends. Ever and anon the little sleeper started. The mother's soft, low lullaby soothed him to quiet. The two bent over and kissed him, oh, so fondly! while anxious hearts breathed a silent prayer. He was laid to sleep in his downy cradle bed. For awhile eyes full of tender solicitude kept watch. The babe slept, sweetly.                 v ' Only a little nervous fatigue, darling." The mother tucked the cover about the placid form and retired. At midnight a groan was heard. Springing from her couch, Evangel lighted the lamp and, looked upon her boy. His face wore a strange look. She kissed his forehead. It was parched with fever! felt, his hands-the pulse leaped wildly! "Oh, Herbert! Herbert I my husband; our darling is so sick! Do dress yourself and run for Dr. Rives. I am so alarmed; he seems to be so ill! There's not a moment to be lost!" The father bent over the bed. Just at that moment the little hands twitched convulsively--the features became con- torted, a moan escaped the fevered lips. ' Quickly, my husband; quickly-run, runI Herbert has   Under the Rod.         27 dI    a spasm! Oh! do hasten, else it may be too late I I fear he 1:    is dying now I " Mr. Wiseman threw on his clothing, and rushing into the street ran to the office of the physician. The mother was left alone with her unconscious babe. J Who shall speak the fearful agony of that dark hour? Oh, Father, let Thy ministering angels be near each mother in such crises! She sat with the little sufferer on her lap, W; atching its unnatural movements and listening to its hur- ried breathing. Stunned with dread apprehension, she could not think. She felt something should be done, but what was best she could not tell. She dares not jeopardize the child's life by unskillful measures, and yet she realized that some effort should be speedily made. The little sleeper moaned on-the convulsive movements grew more decided. Evangel's heart stood still. Alone- alone with her dying child! With superhuman effort at self-control, she sat gazing on the fevered form and pain-marked features. Once she endeavored to arouse him. Bending low, she kissed the burning lips, and whispered in tones of sweetest tenderness, "Herbert, my darling, my precious one, look at mamma  Does Herbert know mamma? It's mamma, Herbert. Look at mamma, darling." A convulsive movement took place in the little sufferer's countenance, and something like a faint smile was for a moment seen. But quickly it died out and left the same sad look, which but too truly spoke his fearful condition. "Oh, God! my Father, spare my child. Take him not from me. Oh, spare him, spare him, I pray Thee, Thou Merciful One. I cannot give him up. He must not go--he cannot go. Let him live-Oh, let him live!" Bursting mother-heart! Who shall still the fierce surg-     28       Evangel Wiseman. ings of thy anguished bosom?- Only the Sufferer on Cal- vary can. Through the breaking soul wildly swept a current of feeling hitherto unknown. A few moments and Evangel had passed a new stage of existence, whose memories should forever haunt her imagination with visions of woe and suf- fering. How often do we in one brief hour live unnumbered years of joy or sorrow! Reader, hast thou ever passed under the rod? Hast thou drank of this bitter cup of woe? If so, then thou dost understand the motherts agony. If not, no words of mine could make you comprehend it. All along this life-path our feet must tread, arise these new and momentous experiences. They take possession of our very being. 'They transform our very nature. Endur- ing mile-stones are they, on which are engraved, in inefface- able characters, heart-records to be forgotten only when the heart is still. To-day we sail in the very empyrean of bliss--to-morrow we plunge into the deepest abysses of misery. And thus the poor soul tempted and tossed, striving to escape these dire calamities. alike abhorrent to its nature and its tastes, plunges on-on-on in the unequal struggle, beating vainly against the prison-bars of its destiny, to find, ere it sinks in the darkness of despair, that there is no hope but in the Eternal God!--no rest but child-like trust in Jesus, who having tasted the bitter cup-yea, drained it to its very dregs-is able to succor all who are tried and tempted, for He bore the curse for every man. As soon as it was possible to obtain him, Mr. Wiseman returned with the physician. Dr. Rives examined the babe closely. He found the symptoms very alarming. A man of kind heart and fine \   As              Under the Rod.         29 judgment, not wishing to add to the deep distress of the - anguished parents, he spoke hopefully, but knew full well that unless a favorable change should soon take place, the dread ravages of disease must quickly terminate in death. Having passed through a similar trial only a few months previously, the remembrances of the deep sorrow so fresh in his mind, he knew full well how to sympathize with his friends. He acted with prompt decision-used the most efficacious remedies-and in the course of an hour the little one was sleeping, unconscious of pain. Yet the breathing continued quick and irregular-the pulse was ardent and fast. With sealed lips and tearless eyes the stricken parents bent over that little bed until day-dawn. The moaning babe slept on. The breathing was hard-the flesh hot. Dr. Rives returned at an early hour. His face grew gravely solemn as he watched the child. The parents dared not ask a word. They could not hear at his lips what they felt must be the truth. Using all remedies he deemed proper at that stage of the disease, and advising extreme quiet, the physi- cian left with timid step and sober mien. Friends came in with words and offices of sympathy. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon took the place of the bowed watchers by the little bedside. Miss Delia was untiring in her acts of love and devotion. One sad thought preyed on her mind. Whlat if Herbert should die without baptism? I)r. Cheney was absent, having gone to a neighboring city to visit the bedside of a dying friend. There was no other clergyman in the place. Miss Daylah," whispered Bridget, in bated breath, as she met her on the stairway descending from the sick room, "the dear leetle maun is mity sick. Oughtn't you to have yer praste?"     30       Evangel Wiseman.       i Dr. Cheney is from the city, Bridget, and there is no other minister of our church." "Send for my praste, then. The dear leetle sowl ought not to die widout the holy sacriment. Shall I go now? I can jest run over to-Father Kelley's, and be back in a jiffy I " "Not now, Bridget. Herbert is very ill, but he may recover, and I do not think Mr. Wiseman would allow your priest to baptize his child. You know he does not believe I in infant baptism at all, but surely he would not object to Evangel's having it done." Bridget crossed herself reverently, muttering a prayer to the Holy Virgin, to which she added, What orful herrytics to let the leetle darlint's sowl be lost so!" Lilly's heart was bowed with grief. The babe had learned to call her "Nan Illy," and they had so often rollicked and played together that he had become to her a sweet companion. To see him thus suffering was more than her womanly heart could bear, and she wept inconsolably. It was a sad and tfearful day at Our Home, that 6th day of  June, 1868. The life of the idolized child was fast ebbing away. And yet hope lingered fitfully in the hearts of the parents and friends. But the Death Angel commissioned from  on high had come to claim the unstained spirit, and inexorably he folded his dark wing over the dwelling until the demand should be honored. All that love and skill could suggest and execute was done to relieve the little sufferer, and stay if possible the hand of death. Unequal contest! Unavailing were all the offices of love and skill to stay the strides of the relentless foe. Shall mortal man contend with the Almighty?  His arm is too short, his wisdom foolishness with Him. The evening sun threw lengthened shadows; as his last soft beams stole out from the chamber where the child lay,   r Under the Rod.        31 the ransomed spirit borne up on the wings of angels entered into the presence of Jesus. Blissful abiding-place evermore. A sad wail filled each apartment of the darkened home. The little one was so dear to all. How solemn, how fearful the moment when the last faint breath dies out, and with it the last -flickering ray of hope I Speechless agony Rayless gloom! How fierce the combat of love with death I How the soul realizes the eternity of sorrow I Sorrow eternalized in memory-the imperishable permanence of the adored one who is part of us and must exist with us and in Us as long as being endures. In our- hopeless sorrow we sit down with blinded vision. Could we but see with eye of faith that era of renewed life -when manumitted and glorified in form, even as the Son of God--" the prisoners of hope" shall come forth to the joyous waking of that eternal morn, when unending hallelu- jahs of complete and glorious victory shall ascend from myriads " which" no man can number, would we not even here catch up the refrain of those eternal symphonies, and even here in this vale of tears sound notes of triumphant music with the angels? But alas, the "things of time and sense " dull and deaden all our spiritual faculties, and we cannot rise above them. Herbert was dead! This was the only truth of time and eternity that the parents realized. The blow had fallen like the blasting lightning from heaven, and their souls were withered by the stroke. They staggered and sank beneath its power., Bewildered, they sat down in mute agony. They could not look upward. They dared not look above. The pall of death enshrouded the universe. What inexpressible woe the poor soul endures in such a moment  The light of heaven, so suddenly eclipsed; every note of sweetest music hushed into deep silence;    i vanget wzseman. every harp-string snapt never again to be united-every rising joy quenched in darkest night. How utterly hope- less and helpless humanity is, under such trialsl How powerless is Reason with all her vaunted majesty I All her ,offerings are veritable mockery-repulsive to the soul. She cannot bind up one wound, cannot pour the mollifying ointment into one laceration, cannot throw one ray of light over the Cimmerian darkness, nor plant one flower over the deep, cold grave. Nor can it look beyond that grave, but must forever sit beside it and gaze into its yawning chasm and wonder why. it had to be dug. Revelation does not supplement reason. It furnishes the facts-facts without which reason would be powerless. "Man by searching cannot find out God." . It was absolutely necessary that Jehovah should reveal Him- self to His creatures. The words of kindest sympathy fell on unheeding ears.  The stricken ones were deaf as blind. How unavailing is human effort in such an hour! It cannot dam the on- sweeping current of woe. No, no, like a waif on the bosom of the foaming cataract, it is borne away unnoticed. Oft-times we ask ourselves, "Why has man been thus created?"Endowed with limitless capacity for love, ob- jects are given him on which to concentrate and lavish this love. Then, in a moment, when we least look for it, they are suddenly swept from us and forever hidden from our sight. In thus questioning the fiat of the Almighty, man looks only at himself in a probationary state. His view is narrow when he thus reasons, because it is limited by the seen. He takes not into account his own immortality, nor that of those he loves. By FAITH the offering must be made, if we realize "that these light afflictions which are but for a moment, are working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."         '  *         '    '.)   Under the Rod.         33 It is absolutely necessary for our soul's good that our Fgther's hand thus hedge us in;-otherwise we would hope- lessly stray from IIim. It is thus our faith must be discip- lined-our carnal tastes subdued-our eyes fixed on the prize -our souls girded for the conflict. It was necessary that Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, be made perfect through sufferings. (Heb. 2: 10.) Sublime truth Let us, amid our trials, lay it to heart; and in so doing, sym- pathize with the God-Man, knowing that the Great High Priest of our profession " is touched with the feeling of our infirmities." Affliction severs man from his fellow-man. It is an isola- tion-a development of personality. "A stranger cannot meddle with his grief." Alone he must bow in the pres- ence of the dread Infinite. If he has no faith-nlo knowledge -no love-he can only bow-and fear. The babe had not been baptized! This added to the weight of woe that pressed down the breaking hearts to the earth. Only Mr. Wiseman was free from its fearful tor- ment. He had been reared by Baptist parents, who had taught him the Scriptures from his youth. He knew that in order to do the will of God, that will must first be known and understood. And realizing the literality of that blessed promise-that God giveth wisdom liberally to all who ask- so that the way-faring man, though a fool, shall not err in the matter of the soul's salvation-they had ever insisted that each one of their household should study the Word oi God for himself. In this way Herbert, at an early age, had become very familiar not only v'ith the historic facts of the Old and New Testaments, but also understood the doctrines as far as an unregenerate mind could. And when, evening after evening, he and Evangel had     34       Evangel Wisenzana. read and discussed the distinguishing features of their respective denominations, he had in almost every case suc- ceeded in convincing her that his views were correct, because Scriptural. The night wore on in sleepless sorrow-the day came up clear and bright-but its glorious beauty brought no glad- ness. Tear-filled eyes could see no joy in the brilliant mock- ery of the gorgeous world. Arrangements must be made for the funeral. Dread neces, sity! The precious form must be hidden out of sight. No love could set aside the inexorable decree of " dust to dust." Who should officiate at the funeral was a question with Evangel's friends. Dr. Cheney had not returned. Miss Delia, who superintended, had not even thought of Dr. Eaton, the Baptist minister. It was a momentous question: one that could, not be decided. "I will speak to Evangel," said Miss Delia, after a con- sultation with several of her Episcopal friends. "My husband must decide," she replied. Mr. Wiseman selected Dr. Eaton. Evangel coincided in his desires. Often had she heard, in company with her husband, this man of God explaining the way of life through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. To deep piety and thorough acquaintance with the Scriptures, were added the advantages of a clas- sical education, earnest manner and commanding appear- ance, so that in all Chester there was not a more deeply beloved nor highly respected minister than Dr. Eaton. It was a noted event in the family of Mr. Vernon-that of a Baptist minister performing the funeral offices for one of their dead. But there was no alternative; so they must submit. Moreover, they entertained the greatest respect for their son, and the unimpeachable character and fine standing of Dr. Eaton in the community caused them to regard this r *               o      o t\   Under the Rod.          35 ,innovation of a time-honored custom as at least to be toler- ated. And they made all necessary arrangements for the burial without a word of dissent. A funeral, always solemnly impressive. was particularly so on this occasion. The beauty of the idol-child-his sudden death--the mute yet fearful grief of the father, as in the sud- denness of this mysterious bereavement he groped in deep darkness-the utter prostration of the mother, who felt she could not resign her babe to the tomb-the sorrow, still, yet deep, of the doting grandparents, for this their first ogand- child,-the grief, apparently as excessive as that of the mother, of the maiden "Aunt Delia," who added to her dread affliction the fearful conviction that the child was not saved. It had not been baptized. How, then, could it be?"Ahl had she but known that he would die, she would bave per- formed the rite herself,- How shamefully neglectful she had been  How could she forgive herself?" Thus she solilo- quized, as she sat beside the casket and gazed with sorrlow- ful heart on the little Herbert sleeping there. "Unbaptized 1 unbaptized!" she repeated, shaking her head slowly, and wringing her hands, while the hot tears fell thick and fast. Lilian was inconsolable. It was the first time in hIer young, glad-life that the death shadow/ had fallen across her path. It was so strange-so marvelously strange-rshe was bewildered-prostrated. She would kneel beside the open casket, gaze imploringly into the sweet, still face as if to call back the dear form, and then wander away, but to return and kneel again to weep. Loving hands had so tenderly and oeautifully prepared, the little Herbert for his marriage to the grave. As he lay I      there shrouded in his snowy robes-the dimpled hands rest- i    ing so daintily over the heaveless bosom-with look or ruddy health overspreading form and feature, the short, X.}     36       Evangel Wiseman. curly hair brushed back from the vein-marked temple, and that smile of perfect peace which only the dead can wear, he seemed a cherub who had stolen to earth from- the upper spheres, and, weary with his journey, had laid himself to sleep amid a bower of virgin flowers. Oh, Death, thou art beautiful! Thou stiller of all earthly sorrows Thou quieter of all its pains! Thou soothing friend that lullest to sleep all heart-aches-all bitterness-all strife. We dread thee because thou art so mysterious--so incomprehensible I We call thee "Destroyer," but thou art not. No atom which thou dost claim shall ever be lost. Thou art simply the Sower of earth's great harvest-field, and the corruptible seed which thou art ever hiding from our sight shall, in the great day of resurrection, arise in glorious beauty and power, and wave forever a victorious immortality in the presence of Hinm whose servant thou art. We call thee "Dread Monarch!" "King of Terrors! but thou art not. Thou art but the commissioned agent of the Most High, doinrg His will and performing for His sons and daughters an office work necessary for their eternal good and glory. Reap on, sow on. God Himself will garner in His own appointed time. We dread thee because we do not love God. And we disparage thee because we understand not His purposes. In thronging groups sympathizing friends came to the house of death. In the darkened parlor, once so cheery because of the presence of the beauteous babe, now so drear and repulsive because its light was gone, gathered the mourners around the little bier. The man of God came too, with words of wisdom and heavenly consolation. How fully and comfortingly did he show that children are not saved by anything man can do for them, but through the blood of Jesus. His words, so full of sympathetic love, were also replete with heavenly *   Under the Rod.          37 truth: "The little one that God had just taken to Himself had never sinned after the similitude of Adam;s transgres- sion; and now having paid all the debt required of it by the law of divine justice--namely, the death of the body-had assuredly gone to dwell in heaven, having been redeemed by the precious blood of atonement. No condemnation resting on ]lis infant spirit-' for this is the condemnlation--that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light?-it was borne by attendant angels to the presence of its Redeemer.' How soothingly these words of gospel truth fell on the tried heart of the mother I The Tempter was busy with her fears. a' My babe was not baptized," she had said over and over again' to herself; "Can it be that it is not saved?" And Satan, ever ready to torture the souls of men, would whisper, "You knew your duty and you did it not." He took hler religious education with all its prejudices; the prac- tices of the church and of so many religious people; her love for her babe, which was idolatrous, and using first one and then the other of these reasons, he was driving her mad with apprehension, lest she, through willful neglect, had suf- fered her child to go down to eternal death. Always busy, going to and fro seeking his prey, Satan is two-fold more active when men are in trouble. How assidu- ously he then plies his wily sophistries! "Command thou these stones to be made bread."2 "Cast thyself down." "All these will I give thee, only fall down and worship me," were his presumptous words to Jesus in the wilderness, Where shall the tried soul, tempted by such hellish machina- tions, find strength to resist? Only in this-"It is written" -the word of God is firm as the everlasting mountains; all the assaults of the Deceiver can never shake it one jot or tittle; God is its author;- He will triumph over every oppo- 1     ser ; let not His people fear I I      38       Evangel Wi'seman. The last look had been taken; the last kiss of love given. Let us not dare to speak of the agony of these breaking hearts. The casket-lid is sealed; the precious form shut in from sight, forever. Slowly the weeping train followed the little white hearse to Elmwood.. Around the gaping chasm, so horrid in its dull, cold outlines, parents and friends stood mute. No eye was lifted to heaven.- Did no heart go thitherward in prayer? A pause, oh, so fearful-and the little coffin was lowered into the grave. A pause-then on the still evening air floated out in notes of wondrous beauty these grand words of victory: ' I am the Resurrection and the Life." What a ring of power have these words of the Risen One I Where is the sting of death-the triumph of the grave- 'when Jesus stands beside it and proclaims, "He that believ- eth on me, though he be dead, yet shall he live again "? Pleadingly went up the simple prayer; then the earth rattled on the coffin-lid. Ah, the shuddering of the stilled heart, the agony of the bursting soul I DUST TO DUST-ASHES TO ASHES. Dark, fearful trial-moment-the universe clothed in sack- cloth-the anguish of the pit reveling through the being. Father, by thy grace, stay the stricken ones now! The grave was filled; the wreaths of jasmine and white honeysuckle placed on the bed of the little sleeper. The parents took a longing look through tear-dimmed eyes at that little hillock--which was now to them all of earth that possessed value-and turned away. Think you the precious dust was left alone? Nay verily I All unseen, ministering angels came and took loving watch over that little sepulchre. And guard it well they will until the waking notes of the Resurrection morn shall break upon the still air.- Then shall the little sleeper come forth to immortal glory.

Dr. Cheney retprned the day following the funeral. Miss Delia hastened to him with her troubles. His heart was full ,of kindly sympathy; for, when the little Herbert was laid -away to sleep, the grave closed over the remains of his eld- est son. "Let us hope for the best," was his tremulous response to the question, 4'if the child could be saved without baptism?" This dubious reply did not at all satisfy the anxious fears of Miss Delia's mind, but she forbore to interrogate further until the Bishop should be more composed. Since Herbert's death she had studied her prayer-book most faithfully to see its teachings on the subject. She found baptismal regenera- tion unequivocally laid down. In sorrow she had turned from it to the Bible, but she knew not where to find instruc- tion in its pages, and she was left to fill up her days and \      nights with fear and self-reproach. ] Feeling too deeply for Evangel's Wroe, she dared not men- tion her'doubts to her. She knew from Mr. Wiseman she i!l                             l     40       Evangel Wiseman. would receive no consolation, as he utterly discarded infant baptism, and she did not regard him as at all competent to instruct her, as he had not been brought up in the Church, nor would he receive any of her teachings. It was a subject of conversation between her and Lilly, but their fearful ques- tionings could not be hushed nor- answered. They must wait until such time as Dr. Cheney could explain the subject to them. Sanctified by the Holy Spirit, the sad chastening was to become to the bereaved ones the Hand that should lead them out of the dark valley of the shadow of death into the full sunlight of that glorious life whose pulsings, coming from -the heart of the Great Eternal, should beat on--on-increas- ing in fruition and power and glory unspeakable as long as. God Himself shall exist. Led by a way they knew not, they were following the loving voice of the Gentle Shepherd, who, having taken their lamb unto His bosom, was saying to them, in most endear- ing accents-"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Come unto me and I will give you rest." Oh, how eagerly' they heard these inviting notes now! Through years- of long-suffering and tender forbearance Jesus had stood with loving heart and outstretched arms, calling all the day long -and when the night-shades came down, the refrain of hiss sorrowful lamentation was, "YE WILL NOT." And so He must needs speak to them through the little lamb of their earthly fold-their only little one-so tender and so loved. And now, though dead, it was calling to them to come into the fold of thevLord, where they should ever find " green pastures " and " still waters." Evangel had so longed to speak to her husband about their baby's salvation, but she knew not how to begin. She was filly aware of his sentiments, but she felt she might be mis-   Life fronm the -Dead.       41'      taken. The words of Dr. Eaton had been comforting to her at the time' but their force had yielded to her constant ques- tionings. She was growing fearfully disturbed on this point, and felt she must unbosom her fears to some one who could gtuide her aright. Herbert witnessed her deep sorrow, and strove in every way possible to alleviate it. The two now gave themselves, with renewed earnestness, to the study of God's Word and to prayer. And it pleased the. Holy Spirit to take of the things that belong to Christ and show unto them. Salvation through faith in Jesus they now saw plainly was the gospel that the God-man had com- manded to be preached as a testimony, and-they gladly accepted it. The scales of education and prejudice fell from the eyes of Evangel on this point, and henceforth she could see clearly the way in which she should walk homeward to the New Jerusalem. It was a wondrous revelation to her. She beheld all creeds, all forms,- all ceremonies, all ecclesiastical teachings, all time-honored customs, swallowed up in the great ocean of love, and heard the voice of the Master proclaim, ONLY BELIEVE. It was enough for her. It met the anxious yearnings of her soul. And yet there lingered in her mind a fearful inquiry, which she resolutely endeavored to banish, as not consonant with the Word of God, but which ever and anon would clamor for consideration. , Daily she visited the little grave to weep, and plant fragrant flowers. And as she would sit above the little mound, she would ask herself, "Where now is the spirit of my babe? Does it dwell with God, or is it. shut out from His joyous presence?"And as the thought rose that, after all, there might be some virtue in the ordinance which she had neglected to have administered, and through that neglect his eternal destiny was fixed in misery, her reason staggered, her faith became unsteady, and despair . *     42       Evangel Wisenma4. seized her very soul. "If there was no efficacy in baptism, why had it been practiced by good men in all ages-men of undoubted honesty and marked piety-and why did the Church insist so strenuously on its observance?"Would Christian ministers be so arrogant as to baptize in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, if there was no com- mand or necessity for it? Thus for hours she would sit by the grave or the empty cradle, and yield her mind to this fearful subject. Several times she had essayed to speak to her husband. But when- ever the prompting came, the words died on her lips. How strange it is, that with the plain and unmistakable will of God concerning us, so clearly laid down in the Gospel of Christ-with the requirements of all relations, spiritual and temporal, expressly made known-men will leave the commands of God, making them of none effect either as a matter of faith or rule of action, but will follow with the blindest zeal and the most complete self-abnegation the traditions of the elders! will boldly neglect the weightier matters of the law-truth, justice and judgment-that they may scrupulously attend to the mint, anise and cummin! When we come as reasonable creatures to sum up and see how much of our religious faith is the offspring of religious education-how much the result -of prejudice founded on early training-how much is the offshoot of vague belief in what we suppose the honest opinions of others-and then compare this deduction with what we believe, because God Himself has revealed it to us, we must, as honest men, fear that, after all our professions, all our zeal, all our boasted knowledge, we shall at last find ourselves cast away. And now a new era comes to the bereaved ones. Having found that peace which passeth knowledge, by trust in the Lord Jesus Christ-having by faith laid hold on   Life from the Dead.       43 she promises of eternal life-Herbert Wiseman felt it his imperative duty to Him whose atoning blood had purchased and sealed to him a right to the "better inheritance" and the "incorruptible crown," to come out and acknowledge the Master before the world. Honest in his convictions- steadfast in his integrity-unwavering in his purposes-he saw but one way to do this. The requirements of the Gospel for church membership were unmistakably clear to his mind. And he felt, without conferring with flesh and blood, he must follow Christ whithersoever He led. And yet to do this with his own loved Evangel-now doubly dear because of their common suffering and their common faith in the blessed Redeemer--left a communicant in a body altogether removed in faith and practice from the one with which he must unite, was to him a deep trial. He prayed much over this momentous point. He believed with unwavering faith that all things are possible with God. And he trusted that now, as his wife was the subject of the enlightenment and guidance of the Holy Spirit, she would eventually be led into all truth. He well realized the fearful difficulties she would have to surmount to become a member of the Baptist Church,-the painfulness of rending family ties-the dread of taking a step which, he knew and felt, nust subject her to unjust censure and unkind remark, and sever bonds which all the years of her past life had been spent in strengthening. All this he was apprised of, and fully appreciated. But he had hope in her high resolve-her firm, conscientious belief-her lofty views of Christian obligation--and above and far beyond all these, her love for Christ, through whom she now beheld a way opened for her to the Celestial City, where all was peace and joy; where she faintly hoped that, though unbaptized, her little Herbert dwelt with the angels.     "       Evangel Wiseman. About three months ,after the death o0f Herbert, the Rev. Mr. Eaton, by especial invitation of the family, called to tea at "u Our Home." Mr. Wiseman had told his wife of his blessed hope in Christ, and the joy of this assurance. lHe had also communicated to her his conviction of duty. The Lord having done so much for him, he would gladly attest His goodness in the presence of the great congregation. The minister had -been- requested to visit them, that these religious considerations might be calmly weighed, and decided upon. Tea being over, Dr. Eaton asked for the Bible, and read- ing a portion of the fifteenth chapter of John's gospel, the three sang that beautiful hymn, the great favorite of the distinguished Dr. Carson, when, feeling himself called upon to renounce his former tenets, and leaving friends, and sev- ering church relations for the truth's sake, he united himself with the humble band of Christ's followers, who, in fhe face of persecutions, imprisonments and fines, bore glad testi- mony to the revealed truth as taught in God's Word. As the soft, sweet voice of Evangel, subdued by sorrow to a plaintive tone, sang: "And must I part with all I have, My dearest Lord, for thee? It is but right since thou hast done Much more than this for me. Yes, let it go-one smile from thee Can more than make amends For all the losses I sustain, Of honor, riches, friends"- Herbert thought how beautifully applicable to the case of his own dear wife. As these words of heroic triumph fell tremulously from the lips of Evangel, (for oh! she remembered too well the agony of that parting,) her soul was filled with wondrous   Life from the Dead.        45 faith; she saw that she must leave all-relinquish all-that she had heretofore held dear, that she might honor Him who had ransomed her. What power even to the faint and timid soul can the Spirit of the living God impart! The song sung, the three bowed in prayer. How earn- estly did the supplicant beseech the Giver of all wisdom to direct these believers in the right way, and to vouchsafe to *them a clear perception of duty, and strength to perform it in every requirement! Sacred scene! the three, with Christ in the midst dis- pensing light and blessing I The remainder of the evening was passed in explaining those points of faith and practice that had not hitherto been fully understood. And when Dr. Eaton took leave, Herbert and Evangel felt greatly built up in the most holy faith.   "       Evangel TWiseman. CHAPTER IV. WALKING IN THE LIGHT. THEY "OBEY THE FORM OF THE DOCTRINE." "The entrance of Thy words giveth light; It giveth understanding unto the simple." (Ps. 119:180.) (-JVANGEL still questioned as to baptism. With all her a  prejudices and tastes cultivated to the highest degree of opposition to the II vulgar ordinance" of immer- sion, as she had frequently heard it denominated-not under- standing its significance as a type of the "fulfillment of all righteousness " by Jesus, when He should expiate the sins of the world on Calvary, be buried, and rise again-she could not yet feel the necessity for her to be immersed, as she had already been sprinkled " in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost." "Would not this suffice?" was the question she propounded to herself whenever the thought of uniting  with Dr. Eaton's church presented itself to her mind. True, she remembered quite distinctly when Dr. Cheney had repaired to the Baptist meeting house to immerse Mrs. Rogers, who desired to unite with his congregation, but, believing that immersion alone is baptism, would submit to nothing else; and he, in order to secure her, had to adminis- ter the " vulgar ordinance "' in presence of many witnesses. Aunt Delia had said on the occasion, that "Mrs. Rogers was very prverse--that having been raised a bigoted Baptist, she  did not know anything more decent than to go down into the water and be dipped, and then come up looking just  a perfect fright. . For her part she wouldn't have gone to witness such a ludicrous spectacle, but Dr. Cheney had insisted on it." /.    Walking in the Light.       47 Some of Miss Delia's friends thought perhaps curiosity was partly the cause of her attendance on the ".ludicrous spectacle." A"But then," said Evangel to herself, "Mrs Rogers having been raised a Baptist, had never been sprinkled. But I have been, and now why be immersed?" About the subject of close communion, which is such a bug-bear with Pedo-Baptist denominations, she knew noth:- ing at all. It was a point that had not been brought to her consideration. Strictly an Episcopalian-never communing with any other than her own people, nor seeing others com- mune with them-never having been taught by her church the erroneous, belief, that the Lord's Supper is a test of christian fellowship, a view wholly unwarranted by the Word of God-she did not once look into that mooted mattel . Faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ as the-doctrine of salvation for both soul and body, Evangel Wiseman now fully understood. Her mind was fully disa- bused with regard to reliance for the safety of her soul on anything but the finished work of Jesus. The Holy Spirit had clearly revealed to her this sublime truth, and had enabled her to lay hold upon it-to know it for herself, and not another for her. She discarded all human rites, all reli- ance on ordinances, all thoughts of penance and good works; now she saw Jesus, and Jesus only-the Friend of sinners, the Saviour of the soul. "Dr. Eaton, the Baptist preacher, took tea at Evangel's day before yesterday evening," said Miss Delia to Mrs. Vernon, as she paused on the portico for a conversation with that lady before going up stairs to lay aside her bonnet and parasol. She had just returned from Mr. Wiseman's. having spent the night with Evangel, with whom she deeply  48        Evangel Wiseman. sympathized in her loneliness. "Yes, he not only took tea, -but he spent the whole evening, and read and explained the Bible, Evangel- told me; and I do believe from all I could gather that she had a strong notion of joining his church. Just think of it-a Vernon a Baptist!"? And Miss Delia's face assumed an expression of utter contempt. What is that, aunty?" asked Lilly,. appearing in the hall door, attired for a walk. "I was just saying to sister that I do believe Evangel is going to join that Baptist church of Dr. Eaton's." "Oh no, aunty, you must be mistaken. What does Evangel want to join two churches for? Is n't she already a member of the church; why should she join another?" "Oh, it is Herbert's ilfuence entirely. He had that Bap- -tist preacher there Wednesday evening to tea, and I know it was for the sole purpose of talking Evangel into their way of thinking. You know she believes everything her hus band does is exactly right; and notwithstanding she knows -theseSBaptists are ignorant and bigoted, and will insist on everybody being dipped like poor Mrs. Rogers, she'll be as certain to go with them as she lives, and all just to please that husband of her's! Thank goodness, everybody lias n't got a husband to please " "Oh,.aunty, sister's not going to join the Baptists. Don't give yourself any trouble' about that. You know brother himself is not a member of the church, and do you think she is going to leave the only church to unite with a people she knows nothing about? Do you think she will, lamma?" "I think not, dear,j' replied Mrs. Vernon, thoughtfully. - 4 I can see no reason why she should. If your brother were a member it would be different. But he is not, and I do not know that he contemplates uniting with them at all. -He is opposed to infant baptism because he has been taught              .    Walking in the Light.       49 from his infancy that it is not necessary; but really I do not know that he holds the views of the Baptists, for I have heard him say very little about it. And you know he has attended our church quite frequently since he married Evangel." "Well, if that Baptist preacher's visit doesn't mean some- thing I'm mistaken," interfered Miss Delia significantly. "And then Evangel acts and talks so strangely-so different from what she used to." Mrs. Vernon smiled quietly. Lilly ran down the steps for her walk. "Where are you going this morning, Lilly * to see your sister?" "Not just now; I am going first to Dr. Cheney's. Fanny Cheney, Annie Chiles and I havean engagement to call upon Miss Mordaunt,- at Mrs. Falkland's, that beautiful heiress from New Orleans." "And is she a Baptist, too, like Mrs. Falkland? If so, I do n't see any need of cultivating her acquaintance." "Oh no, aunty, she is a Catholic, so Nellie Nesbitt told me. So you see you need have no fears of ' evil communi- cations corrupting good manners.' Nellie pronounces her splendid! ' "Well, I don't like the Catholics much either; but they are not half as bad as those Baptists. But wait, I believe I will go with you to the Doctor's. I wish to have a good talk with him." And Miss Delia, hoisting her parasol, set out with Lilly for the Bishop's. Miss Vernon did not pause at the hall door, but proceeded immediately to the Doctor's study. She found the reverend clergyman sitting in dressing-gown and slippers, reading the morning papers. "Pardon my intrusion, Doctor," said Miss Delia, as she 3 50       -Evangel Wiseman. folded her parasol, laid it on the green divan, took out her fan, and seated herself. "I have matters of grave impor- tance to talk to you about, this morning; " and Miss Delia fan in hand, gave her left cuff a little twitch. The Doctor laid aside his newspaper, and arawing his study chair around and nearer that lady, asked with manner quite interested, "What is it, Miss Vernon; I hope nothing serious?" "Have you been to see Evangel since the baby's death?" "Only once, and then for a few minutes. I found her engaged with company, and I sat but a short time." f' You have never, then, had an opportunity of speaking to her on the subject of her neglect of her baby's baptism? Do you know, Doctor, that I think her views are greatly softened down on that point? I really do believe she is so blinded as not to think this holy sacrament necessary." "Well, perhaps it is better she should not, as her child died without it. You can see it would drive her to despair if she regarded it necessary to the salvation of its soul." "Well now, Doctor, what do you think on this subject? You know I asked you about it immediately after the child died, but you had not time to answer. Do you believe a child can be saved without baptism?" "Oh, you know, Kiss Delia, there is a great difference of opinion on that point! And-" "But what is your opinion, Doctor?" "Oh, I trust children may be saved who are not baptized." "Well, why do it, then? And does n't the Catechism say ' wherein,' that is, in baptism, ' I was made a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven'? What is the meaning of this, if it isn't that children are saved by baptism?" "This is the meaning, undoubtedly, Miss Delia, but I   iWalking in -the Light.       51 have sometimes thought that God will save those children whose parents neglect, through ignorance or indifference, to have it done." "Well, for my part, I cannot see how this is. If baptism is necessary to salvation, then the child that dies without it cannot be saved. And if it is not necessary, I do not see any use in practicing it at all. For my part, I believe just what the ' Prayer-book ' says. And I think all children should be baptized just as soon as possible. It seems to me, if we deny the teachings of the Catechism, we had just as well do away with the ordinance entirely. I do wish, Doctor, you would enlighten me on this point." "Oh, Miss Delia, our divines are divided on this very point! Melville says,-with the Prayer-book in his hand, he is obliged to believe in baptismal regeneration." "Just so I say!" and Miss Delia gave her cuff another twitch. "But others think that unbaptized children are saved, or at least may be saved, and contend for the rite because the Church has always practiced it, and it is taught in the Bible." "But what is the object the Church has had in the ordi- nance, and why does the Bible enjoin it?" "Well, on this, as about baptismal regeneration, there is a great variety of opinion, some inclining to one view, and others to another. For my part I find it a practice of the Church, and enjoined in her teachings, and so I administer it in accordance with her prescribed formula., "You don't mean to say, Doctor., that it is not in the Bible?" and Miss Delia twitched that left cuff violently. "Certainly not! certainly not! Oh, it is in the Bible I and it has always been a practice of the Church, and should be administered to every child of every communicant." "Oh, there is another question, Doctor, I wish to ask you   52       Evangel Wiseman. before I come to the subject of my visit. Mr. Wiseman once said that our Church began with Henry the Eighth of England. Is this so, Doctor? I denied it, and told him I knew he was wrong; that the Episcopal Church had existed time out of mind, and could be traced back to the very times of Christ. And he said if this was so, we would have to go through the Catholic Church. Just think of it! Did you ever hear of such ignorance? I told him nobody but a Baptist-raised man would dare assert such a thing. He laughed and said it was a matter of history. But I knew it was only his prejudice and want of information. Wasn't I right, Doctor??" "Oh, I think all such questions are of no moment, Miss Delia," replied the Doctor, evasively. "The Church is old enough to have authority, and that is sufficient. But tell me, what is this important question that you came to ask? and the Doctor looked earnestly into her face. He wished to distract her attention, for such inquiries were not by any means pleasing. "Oh, it's no question I have to ask! It is a piece of sad information I have to communicate. True, I am not so sure I am right, but anyhow it is well to take the thing ill time, else the mischief may be done before we know it. My belief is that Evangel has not only given up infant baptism, but is thinking of joining the Baptists I " The Doctor started from his chair. "You don't think this possible, Miss Delia! What reason have you to believe it?" The expression of surprise lingered on the Doctor's face as he drew his chair closer to Miss Delia, and leaned fbr- ward to catch her every word. "Well, you know, in the first place, Doctor, owing to your absence, Mr. Eaton had to be called to attend the v   i0iil         Walking in the Light.       53 funeral. He talked a great deal about the provision that Christ made for infants when He died--how they were saved through His atoning blood and had no need of any- thing man could do for them to secure their soul's salvation. Now you know he just did this to please Evangel, for some- body told him you were absent and Herbert had never been baptized. And of course Evangel was very much consoled by it, for it saved her child if it is true, even though she did so fearfully neglect her duty. And I think it was just that talk that has caused her to feel infant baptism is not neces- sary. This is one point, Doctor. Then, this Doctor Eaton must be invited to tea. Herbert had this done, I know- and he read the Bible and prayed and explained the Scrip- tures. Now just think of itl A Baptist explaining the Scriptures to a Churchman! Herbert had all this done! I know he did, for he will never be content until his wife believes as he does! I was over there last evening-spent the night with them-and Evangel talked very strangely a great deal about regeneration, as she called it, and faith in Christ alone, etc., etc.,--much that I did not understand, and I don't believe she understood it herself. She had heard her husband and his preacher going over it, and whatever Mr. Wiseman says Evangel believes without any questioning. She seems to think he is wiser in matters of religion than the clergymen themselves. I never saw a woman so infatuated. Now everybody knows that Herbert is a splendid lawyer-none better in all the city; but what can he know about Church matters, raised a Baptist, as he was? You know, Doctor, very well, that all they cling to is their-dipping. Put a man under the water and he is all right; but if lie does not go under it is impossible for him to be saved." "So they believe in baptismal regeneration, do they?"   54       Evangel Wiseman. "Oh, they don't know, I imagine, what they believe, nor do Honly they must baptize by dipping." "But what of Mrs. Wiseman's views?" "Yes, yes, I was going to tell you, that she spoke in terms of the highest praise of Dr. Eaton-of his intelligence -his piety-his agreeable manner-and whatever view Mr. Wiseman advanced she immediately coincided with. And she said, during our conversation, that now she was firmly convinced that no human institutions nor ordinances of man could save the soul, and she no longer attached importance to them. Now I think, Doctor, this means a great deal. I do wish you would call to see her very soon; some time when her husband is not in; for if he is there you can make no impression upon her. You can find out just how she feels and what she intends to do. It would be a terrible blow, a deep mortification to us all, if she should join the Baptists, but I tell you I am fearful, exceedingly fearful that she will, if she is not closely attended to; and nobody can do it but you, Doctor." Dr. Cheney looked puzzled. He could not shape his thoughts. He had sometimes feared that Evangel might be influenced by her husband. But then she had kept up pretty regular attendance on church services. Mr. Wise- man was not a Baptist by profession; he always promptly paid pew-rent-came frequently with Mrs. Wiseman. Some- times he had hoped he might be won. But the fact that the babe was not baptized had always given him considerable qualms. Now he felt his fears were but too well grounded, and he was in a dreadful quandary. "If I could but have an opportunity, Miss Delia, of find- ing out just how Mrs. Wiseman feels and what her views are, I should' know just how to approach and proceed, so as to convince her. But I am, under present contingencies, wholly unarmed."   Walking in the Light.       55 "Well, the best way for you, Doctor, is to visit her at some time when you can see her alone; and by general remarks on the subject of infant baptism and church ordi- nances, you can so manage as to lead her to speak of her views. And then you can find some opening that will give you a chance to sound her thoroughly. She must not be lost to our church, Doctor; I tell you it will never do. It - would be like cutting her off from the family to have hel join those Baptists." "Are Mr. and Mrs. Vernon aware of what you suspect?" "Oh, I don't know about that. It's hard for parents to see these things in their own children. I told sister of it blis morning, but I don't believe she realized it. When can you call, Doctor? Can't you this afternoon, sometime after dinner? I think you will find her alone at that time. Maybe I'll just run over; but if I do, I'll not come to the parlor." And Miss Delia shut up her fan, which she had kept in active motion throughout the conversation, gathered up her parasol, and bidding the Bishop good morn- ing, left for home. "Delicate matter," said the Doctor to himself, half aloud, as he drew his chair up to the libtary table, and toyed with a little green and black specked pen wiper which Evangel had made him when a child. "If it were not for that husband I could do very well. But I want to win him without his knowing what I am about. Oh, if I had only been at home when the child died! Surely then his prejudices, however strong, would have yielded to a sense of duty." [Perhaps Mr. Wiseman regarded duty in a different sense from the Doctor?] "But I must abide by the truth of the old adage, and manage' the case as best I can. It will never do to have it said that one of my most influential members, one whom I baptized in infancy, laid the hands of confirmation upon,     56       Evangel Wisemnan. and then married, has left to join the Bajtists. No, no,  this will never do. If there is such a plan it must be circum- vented! But how to do it-that's the thing. It will never do to enter into an argument if tlis can be prevented, for, doubtless, Mr. Wiseman is fully well acquainted with his side pf the question, and as a lawyer would be very skillful in the management of it. I ntust proceed cautiously. 'Twill never do to make a direct attack. I'll make a recon- noissance this afternoon, see how matters are, and then bring my forces to bear as best I can. This is all I can do." And the Doctor resumed his paper to re-read the statements respecting the Pan-Anglican Council. "What's the matter to-day, Doctor?" asked Mrs. Cheney of her husband, as they sat at dinner that day. "You seem to be quite abstracted. Fannie and James are very quietly  waiting to be helped to beef. We have all a good appetite, s dinner is unusually late." ' "Oh, notling particularly interesting. I am sometimes 4q+ie neglectful, you know. Pardon me. Daughter, pass your plate and be helped." It was very evident to all assembled, that the Doctor was thinking of something, which, if not particularly inter- esting, quite absorbed his mind, for, after waiting on Fannie and James, he neglected Mrs. Cheney and the three smaller children, and, without waiting for dessert, left quite uncere- moniously. Following Miss Delia's instructions, he took up his hat and cane and set out for Mr. Wiseman's about three o'clock. Reaching there, he rang the bell, which was answered by : Miss Vernon, who had seen him coming up the walk through the front window of Evangel's room. "Just in time, Doctor," said Miss Vernon to him in a low tone; "Evangel has been speaking of walking down to the   Walking in the Light.       57 office. I would not tell her you were coming, fearing lest it might spoil our whole plan, if she should discover it. Don't mention her going; it's by no means important." It was the Doctor's third call since the death of Herbert. Evangel was happy to see him, for she had ever loved him dearly, and reposed in him the greatest confidence. Respecting him as a learned and good man, she had always received everything of a religious character from his lips without questioning, until after her marriage, when she had been led to investigate the word of God for herself. Now under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, she found that good men and great men can be led far astray from the truth whenever they renounce the teachings of the Bible and turn to men's creeds and catechisms. Dr. Cheney spent two hours in the parlor of Mrs. Wiseman. We will not here give the conversation, but may infer how satisfac- tory it was to him, when sitting in his study after hi* return, he was heard to say to himself: "Too late, too late! The deed is done!"What anxiety of mind $is decision occasioned him, may be inferred from the fact that, as the town clock struck twelve, he was still in his study pacing to and fro. Miss Delia must be at home to tea. Lilly's friends, Annie and Fannie, were to spend the night with her, and as Miss Delia in a great measure superintended household matters, she felt that her presence was indispensable to the arrangement of the table and parlor. So, as soon as Dr. Cheney left, she took her bonnet and set out for home. Reaching the gate, she paused, undetermined whether she would proceed directly to -Mr. Vernon's, or run by Doctor Cheney's to learn the result of the inter- view, for she had not dared to say one word about it to Evangel, lest she should suspect their purpose.     58       Evangel Wiseman. "Dr. Eaton will take tea with us this evening, Evangel, if agreeable to you," remarked Mr. Wiseman to his wife pleasantly, as he entered her room about half an hour after Dr. Cheney's departure. "I feared you were not fully satisfied respecting baptism; so, meeting him to-day, I insisted that he should spend an hour or two with us and explain it more fully to you." "And I am indebted to this for your early return;, she responded lovingly, leading him to a seat and handing him a fan, adding, I am glad, dearest, that you have done this, for I am not altogether able to see why one baptism is not as good as another." "There is but one baptism taught in the Scriptures, Evangel," replied Mr. Wiseman, quietly. "One Lord, one faith, one baptism," says the apostle Paul, by divine inspiration. Evangel busied herself in making some added preparation for the entertainment of her expected guest. She felt won- derfully attracted towards Dr. Eaton. His beautiful and consoling words on the occasion of Herbert's burial, the evi- dent piety and intelligence manifested in his conversation, his thorough acquaintance with the truths of the Gospel, his firmness in the maintenance of them, and his kind forbear- ance towards others who differed with him, all served to fill her soul with profound love and admiration; so that on anticipating his coming, it was the looking for a friend, not a stranger. After the pleasant repast, the three repaired to the parlor, which Evangel had made more than usually beautiful by the vases of sweet flowers ornamenting mantle and stands. On the center-table was placed the family Bible and Cru- den's Concordance, that such texts as might not be readily remembered might be easily found.  i *   Walking in the Light.       59 Dr. Eaton knew his topic. Mr. Wiseman had informed him of his wish, to explain as nearly as he could the object of the ordinance, and also to give such passages as bore upon it, wisely concluding that this once done satisfactorily, there would be no need of a plea for immersion. Before any explanation was undertaken, Dr. Eaton re- quested his friends to bow with him in prayer, that the Holy Spirit would accompany their investigation by His enlighten- thing and sanctifying presence and influence, so that all might be done to the honor and glory of God, and their guidance into the truth as it is in Christ Jesus; and then, in a few pointed words, explained to her that baptism by immersion (and there is certainly no other) is that form or type which clearly sets forth the doctrine to which all regenerate souls cling--this doctrine being the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus-the only hope for the salvation of sinners-the form of that doctrine being burial with Christ in baptism. As he proceeded, Evangel saw clearly that neither pour- ing nor sprinkling could possibly represent this doctrine, on which every believer must rest for hope of eternal life. Dr. Eaton read to her the testimony of several Pedo-bap- tists on this point. She was particularly struck with the witness of those two great lights of Episcopacy, Conybeare and Howson, who, with regard to Romans 6: 4, Buried with him by baptism unto death, and Col. 2:12, Buried with him in baptism, say, "these passages can only be understood by it being remembered by the reader that the apostolic mode of baptism was by immersion." But Evangel felt, owing to her early instructions, that the "' mode" was not essential; as if there could be modes of a specific act. Baptism is the burial in water and raising therefrom of the body of the believer in Christ, in the name     60       Evangel Wiseman. of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and can never admit of "various modes." It witnesses of Jesus-not of the Spirit- testifies of His death, burial and resurrection; this can only be done by immersion, which Christ Himself submitted to and enjoined on all believers. Dr. Eaton explained to her the duty of a believer. In the words of the Lord and Master Himself, he told her, "Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I have commanded you;" and enjoined upon her the great truth, that obedience to Christ's commands is necessary to disciple- ship, and is far better than sacrifice. When the spirit, in adoring humility, can say, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? the Saviour is more honored than by " all incense and burnt offerings." Christ will not be pleased with our works of supererogation. In His own wisdom He decided while here on earth, the ordinance best adapted to represent the doctrine of His full atonement. He Himself, to typify how He " would fulfill all righteousness," submitted to this ordinance, and bids us follow His example. We dare not take unwarranted license in matters where He has spoken, for His command is imperative; we dare not look to other authority-dare not heed any innovation, should it be made even by an angel. The mind of Evangel was convinced, satisfied-and, as great as the trial might prove, she would take up her cross and follow Jesus. Oh I how she had hourly to pray, "Lord, strengthen Thou me." Two weeks passed. Her convictions became fixed, her determination steadfast. She would go with her husband into the Church of his choice, because she desired to follow Christ. 4' If you love me, keep my commandments," whispered the Holy Spirit into her heart; and that heart, aglow with love 4' to Him who had loved her and called her and washed her in His own blood," responded: Lord, I will follow thee whitherseever thou goest.   Walking in the Light.       61 It was a trial for Evangel to make known her intentions to her parents and Aunt Delia-a trial such as none can realize save those called upon to sever long-standing rela- tions, cemented not only by time, but also by the strongest prejudices, and pursue a course hitherto deemed not only derogatory, but impossible. It was a day of deep sadness tj  with Mr. and Mrs. Vernon. They had feared such result, ?J ityet hoped against fear; and with that dread of looking ?I/  squarely in the face a portending evil event, they had shut out from their minds the contemplation of it as far as pos- sible. So that, while not wholly unexpected, yet it was a fearful shock. XA IMiss Delia added to her regret a high degree of resent- ment, which she expressed in terms neither measured nor elegant. "Too bad! too bad it's entirely too bad!" she ejacuia- ted, as she walked up and down the portico on which were sitting Mr. and Mrs. Vernon, Lilly, Annie Chiles and Fannie Cheney. "Might very well have known how the matter would end when Evangel married that Baptist For my part," she continued, her voice every moment growing louder and her manner more emphatic; "for my part, I don't see why such things are allowed. My conscience is clear about the whole affair. Every one knows I opposed it, might and main. Not but what I like Mr. Wiseman as well as I could anybody in the world-if he were not a Baptist. But I suppose it's all over now, and Evangel will have to be dipped. Well, I for one will not see it. Poor little Her- bert," she said half to herself; " poor little darling, never baptized, and all because of these ignorant Baptists. But I must go and see Dr. Cheney. What will he say to this? Oh! that we had attended to our duty sooner! Fanny, you remain here with Annie and Lilly. I'll be back '1  w      62       Evangel Wiseman. to tea." And Miss Delia, running up stairs, quickly threw on her bonnet, and descending, bade good evening, and set out on her visit of information and condolence. The day came, on which Herbert TWiseman and his wife were to unite with the Baptist church, and be baptized. Evangel's "defection," as Dr. Cheney denominated it in speaking to his members, had created a decided excitement throughout a large portion of the Chester community. Her family, so well known and so highly respected, wielded an extensive influence, and she herself had been known and loved from her childhood, by all classes. The Episcopalians were chagrined as well as excited; the Baptists were rejoiced that truth had proved victorious in the stronghold of error. It would be useless to endeavor to repeat one tithe of the various comments. Each one spoke as he chose. Of course everybody had an opinion, and nerve enough to express it. It was a lovely Lord's Day morning, sweet and calm, as if heavenly airs had afresh visited the earth and breathed into her bosom a spirit of joyful adoration. The Baptist meeting- house was filled at an early hour. Many were present who had never before been within the walls. Some of these were quite surprised 1' to see how respectable-looking the place and people were. Each member of Evangel's family, save aunt Delia, was present; also Fannie Cheney and  Annie Chiles, besides several other members of Dr. Cheney's church. She " could not witness such a  terrible thing," t'would C"break her heart." Aunt Delia loved Evangel much, but she loved her own views more. Of her it might well be said, " stat pro ratione voluntas." She made her own  belief a matter of conscience, and " would not countenance what she knew to be a most dreadful error." Of course she had never given herself any effort whatever   TMalking in the Light.       63 to ascertain whether these bigoted Baptists had any Scrip- tural authority for their doctrines and practice. She only knew that her church did not recognize them. This to her was all-sufficient; so she remained at home to weep over her darling Evangel's apostacy. It was a most interesting occasion, when those two sad, yet rejoicing believers put on Christ in baptism. As in the morning, the house was crowded with attentive observers; and the testimony that was that night borne to the truth by those two believers, who, trusting alone in the blood or atonement for salvation, witnessed their faith and hope by a illing submission to 1' the form of the doctrine,' told, as the ordinance ever must on unprejudiced observers, of the glorious truth of the soul's salvation through Him who died and rose again.  Of some of its results we shall hereafter speak. "I never saw a Baptist baptism before in all my life," re- marked Willie Nesbitt to Annie Chiles as the two passed down the steps. "It was really very impressive." "Beautiful, I thought," replied the young lady. "I had always heard it was so ludicrous, and so unbecoming; but to me it was as solemn as death itself; I could not refrain from weeping ." "And you were not the only one, Miss Annie. It did seem to me that almost everybody in the house wept. I shall never laugh at the Baptists again for their baptism." What did you think of the baptism, Fannie? Didn't sister look beautiful as Dr. Eaton led her down into the water? I had such a terror of it before I went; aunty always told me it was so vulgar. But really, it was the prettiest sight I ever witnessed, and so solemn; didn't you think so?" "I did indeed, I had just your ideas. How mistaken we sometimes are, Lilly; I am so often made to feel that before I pass judgment, I must know for myself."     "       Evangel Wiseman. CHAPTER V. FEARFUL QUESTIONINGS. HE seasons came and wentI and spring, "blessed mother of the flowers," again visited the earth. To "OUR HOME " came, one soft, dewy eve, a fledgling, beautiful and bright. 'Twas heaven's sweet gift, and the parents wept with joy as they pressed it to their bosoms. And as they gazed on its pulsing form and recalled their little one gone, they whispered tremulously, one to another, "Alas! he too is mortal, and must die." Their hearts stilled!-their tears- flowed!-A silent prayer went up before Jehovah. They called the babe "Vernon." The birth of a child!

The genealogical horoscope always shows a favorable posi- tion of the stars when there comes to our hearthstone the dainty little stranger. How everything connected with the whole household converges to that one focal point- the new baby! It is as if the Shekinah had come to earth again and taken up his abode in our tabernacle; and whether we journey through the wilderness, or pitch our tent in the desert, it is a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. A French writer has so truthfully said, "If the child born were not a god, if the relation of the mother to it were not a worship, it could not live.

What! should sudden eclipse come to all their springing glory? What! should the angels, traversing the spheres, look upon their little cherub, and in love. with him, wing him away to their homes!

As the little Vernon lay beside Evangel, her very being F bound up in his, every thought, every tender emotion cen- tering in him, distracting questions began to arise in her mind--questionings somewhat vague, somewhat tangible, fearfully perplexing. Oftentimes since the death of Herbert she had asked her- self, with quivering heart, " would it not-might it not have been better had she had him baptized?"Could he, without -any rite of the Church, get to Heaven? Was not this God's instituted means whereby children were made par- takers of eternal life? Surely, as the,practice was so general and could be traced so far back, it must have some Scripture authority. Herbert had not even been publicly dedicated to the Lord. She and her husband had never together performed any special act of consecration whatever. They had prayed for him alone; alone they had implored the blessings of God upon him, but they had not OFFICIALLY given him to the Lord. "Had they not grievously sinned in tlis omission, and was not the eternal destiny of their child affected by this neglect?" What fearful inquiries for the bleeding, breaking heart of Evangel! And yet, torture as it was, she would ask them over and over. Mother, weeping the loved one lost, have you ever asked yourself these distracting questions? As you have sat in your loneliness, and dwelt on the destiny of that immortal spirit which, but a few days before, looked up into your face through eyes forever sealed--clung so trustingly to you by little hands now so motionless-talked to you in childish     68       Evangel Wiseman. love and innocence, with prattle so sweet, but now forever mute-lived with you in every pulsation of your being, but lives now where? oh! where? If you have not thus thought and wept, then you cannot at all sympathize with the sorrowing, doubting heart of Evangel. But if, like her, you have died with your babe and yet lived on to suffer, the-you know, by an experience more bitter than death, what it is to ask of heaven and earth-yea, of the Word of God itself-this momentous question, and find nowhere in all the universe a direct answer. Oh I how the soul needs, in this fearful exigency, to cling by faith to Christ, and to say, with the tried Patriarch of Uz, "Though He slay me, yet I will trust in Him n"Nothing but a fixed faith-a being kept by the eternal power of God-can stay the soul passing through these deep waters. Before Herbert's death, Evangel had entirely discarded the doctrine of baptismal regeneration; had come to regard infant sprinkling as a rite wholly unnecessary, and wondered why it was that so many pious and intelligent men had been led to embrace a tenet so antagonistic to the teachings of Scripture. But with him gone, the Tempter came subtilely as to the first mother in Eden, and whispered to her perplexed mind and riven heart, "Did you not omit to do for your Oo child, that which was essential to his salvation? Is he not now sent into darkness because you willfully failed to accept the provision made and taught by the Church?"With these suggestions would come up old impressions; old prejudices were revived, and her soul was tormented-miserable- under the various and goading questionings that presented themselves from time to time. With these doubtings and fears buried deep down in her stricken bosom, she had gone into the Baptist Church because she felt it her duty to do so; and as the eternal destiny of her   Fearful Questionings.      69 child was forever sealed, she would not allow her perplex- ities to prevent her doing what she regarded as her impera- tive duty under existing circumstances. She had never mentioned this terrible conflict to her hus- band. Her condition of mind was such that she dared not speak of it to any one. Only He who made her knew the fierce struggle, the ever-plied assaults of the Deceiver. And she could only strive to look up and ask that God would help her, and lead her in the right way. How she longed from day to day to have the matter settled! She would weep and pray, and search God's Word. And then the consoling words of Dr. Eaton would rise up before her; but when the tendrils of hope would feebly reach forth to clasp them for support, the Adversary would come in like a flood and sweep away every refuge, and all around would be wreck and ruin. Oh, that I but knew the truth!" she would exclaim, again and again. "What is God's will in this matter? Does He require of us to do anything, we poor helpless, sinful mortals-that our children may have eternal life, or does it all rest on the finished work of Jesus? If so, why did the Church and why had Christians taught in all ages that bap- tism was essential to salvation?" Day by day, hour by hour, these queries thronged her mind, but no answer came and she was driven almost to des- peration. The way so dark became each day more fearful; cloud on cloud o'erspread the sky-the thunders roared loud, and flinty rocks pierced the bleeding feet,until o'erwhelmed she was made to cry: "Lord, why is this. Wilt thou pur- sue thy worm to death?" Will not the Father take her hand and lead her on? Ah! the gentle Shepherd of Israel was lovingly leading her, but she knew it not; "His eye was not dim that it did not see e knew 'i't     70   -Evangel Wiseman. His poor child; nor His ear dull that it could not hear her piteous cry; neither was His arm shortened that it could not save." He was to her " like a refiner's fire," and He was sitting " as a refiner and purifier of silver," until He should see His image shine forth bright and clear, so that He shall be all and in all--forms and ceremonies, and men's traditions all swept away, never more to be regarded. By a way she knew not, she was journeying onward. The Lord was holding her hand, and keeping all her steps that she should not slide. 'Twas in this way "He answered praver for grace and faith." Be still, tried heart! The Lord will come and will not tarry. Was not Joseph sold into Egypt by wicked brethren? But "God did send him before them to preserve life." "Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and will ye take away Benjamin also?" "All these things are against me/"Not so, afflicted patriarch; they are all working out for your earthly good, and the "far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." The edict has gone forth, and now the multitudes dare not ask petition " of any god save the King only." But the exile Hebrew kneels three times a day before his open window, with his face towards Jerusalem, and gives thanks to his God as he did aforetime. Sublime faith, that could trust in God and do right in the face of death! that could dare do right although every other man in the kingdom did wrong! And the God whom Daniel served "continually" in the deep darkness as well as the light-under the dread prohi- bition as calmly as before it had gone forth, did send His Angel-the Jehovah Angel-the Son of God Himself-who shut the lions' mouths so that they could not hurt him.   Fearful Questionings.       71 Seeing, then, that " we are compassed about with such a cloud of witnesses," shall we fear to do right, though all the world were against us? Let us " not go with the multitude to do evil," though we stand alone to perish for the truth of the Gospel. Evangel argued, in her loneliness and groping, that surely so many good and wise men could not be mistaken, and would not practice what they knew to be unscriptural. They must have found in God's Word authority for what had been the custom of the Church for ages, although she had never been able to do so. All Protestant* denominations sprinkled children in infancy. And the Roman Catholic Church, claiming to be the oldest church organization--(and she could not disprove this claim)-regarded it, as well as the Episcopal Church, essential to salvation. "No child can see the face of God in peace zvithout baptism." Could it be possible all these various sects were mistaken? Would Catholics, Episco- palians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Methodists, etc., preach and practice-yea, urge as a command of Christ and as essential to salvation, an act -for which no authority nor precedent could be found in the Scriptures? This seemed to her an impossible thing. She could not think it true. How many thousands in each generation- use this very same argument, forgetting that the human heart is always better pleased with the teachings of men than with the simple yet sublime truths of the Gospel of the Son of God. Like the Ruler of the Jews, they cannot comprehend the essential truth, " ye must be born again " of the Spirit. So Evangel would always conclude, as thousands of others have done, that there must be some obligation recognized somewhere *Baptists are not Protestants.     72       Evangel Wiseman. in the Bible-something that she had not been able to find or understand-that enjoined the baptism of infants. She would so often call -to mind what she had heard in confirmation in reference to baptism: "Wherein I was made a member of Christ, a child of God and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." What fearful language to her  soul, as she repeated it over and over I If children were " made members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven," in baptism, then surely they are not so without baptism. Her precious child had never been baptized. How, then, could he inherit the kingdom of heaven? HE COULD NOT, if this were true. If not true, why should the Church teach it? ' It must, it must be so." And Herbert was-she could never finish this sentence. Her soul died within her as the fearful decision was reached.  And she was culpable for this fearful neglect. She felt that her husband would not have opposed her, had she insisted on having the babe thus dedicatedl. She had also read, in a book given her by Aunt Delia soon after the death of Herbert, these significant words: 'By baptism we are regenerated in Christ; such is the admirable efficacy of this covenant, as to remit original sin and actual guilt, however enormous, and to replenish our souls with divine grace, by which we are made heirs to the inheritance of eternal life." That "THE LAW OF BAPTISM AS ESTABLISHED BY OUR LORD, EXTENDS TO ALL; INASMUCH THAT UNLESS THEY ARE REGENE- RATED THROUGH THE GRACE OF BAPTISM, BE THEIR PARENTS CHRISTIANS OR INTFIDELS, THEY ARE BORN TO ETERNAL MSERY AND EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION.?* She had also read " that baptism once administered in * Decree of Council of Trent, published 1566.   Fearful Questionings.       73 water in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we believe to be both for adults and for little ones a perfect remedy unto salvation." And the blessed Saviour Himself had said-she knew this was in the Bible, for she had repeatedly read it--"Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven." It is true her husband had explained to her that these words of Jesus could not be so construed as even to imply baptism; and at the time she had thought that his arguments were conclusive. When he had so faithfully shown their meaning, she had not been able to see even the shadow of a foundation for infant baptism in these tender words of the loving Jesus, but she felt now that he might have been mistaken. ' For surely children might -ought to come to the Saviour in some way, and how could they do this so well as in baptism?" And as this deduction--amounting at times to a convic- tion -of the duty of parents to have their children sprinkled- would present itself to her mind, her self-reWseach would become fearful, and she would be driven to despair. She could neither eat nor sleep. She would visit Herbert's grave and sit weeping over it in the deepest gloom; and then, unable to bear the torturing anguish longer, would turn away from the little child-bed and walk the grounds, almost frenzied. Several times, when in these agonized frames of mind, she proposed to herself to send for her minister, Dr. Eaton, and ask him candidly, if he could, to remove her doubts and show her the truth. But she would be deterred from-this step by the reflection that, as regarded her child, the case was forever settled. His destiny-whatever it might be-was fixed, and no amount of repentance nor sorrow on her part could change it. And then, too, she would say, "I have not always felt thus. Before Herbert     74       Evangel Wiseman. died, my views were decided on this subject. Then, I entirely repudiated the doctrine of infant baptism, as unscriptural and unnecessary." But, then, she had not been made fully to see how infants are saved. It had not been demonstrated to her mind that children are saved " alone through the atonement of Christ," without belief in the Gospel, or submission to its require- ments. Unable to know anything of the Gospel plan of redemption, they can believe nothing, can reject nothing; consequently can not be judged by its demands. In, the absence of this great fundamental truth, her mind was in the condition of that of the man from whom the unclean spirit having gone out, the heart was " empty, swept and gar- : nished." So with her; and when these questionings came as to the salvation of her babe, they were seven-fold strong, anid her state of mind was indescribably worse than before ,.  her repudiation of the doctrine of infant regeneration. Then she had something to cling to; now, she was without anything. And thus the days passed on, filled with doubts and fears, these questions ever arising in her mind: "Is my child saved? If saved, how could it be done without' baptism?" And now, another immortal soul had been intrusted to her caret What was her duty towards it? As the tender, unconscious babe lay beside her, fully did she realize that, as a Christian mother, peculiar responsibilities rested upon her! How should she meet, how discharge, those fearfu. obligations?  Hour after hour she would ponder this subject, and strive to fathom the great problem*! What- ever was right; whatever the word of God taught,-that' she would do, even though it might expose her to the charge of inconsistency; might bring upon her public ridi- cule and scorn.   7 Fearful Questionings.      75 So she determined within herself to investigate the ques- . tion; to pursue it until her mind was fully at rest, and, whatever her convictions might be, after a thorough exam- ination and decision, she would act them out regardless of opinions or consequences. Tlmere was too much at stake to admit of any neglect or indifference. She very readily perceived the position in which she would place herself, her husband, and pastor, by requiring baptism for her child. She realized, too, what the world would say; but for this she cared little. But to oppose her husband's firm, and oft-expressed views-to mortify, as she felt it must necessarily do, -the feelings of her kind, good pastor and the beloved deacons of her church-this would be a trial unspeakable. She shrank from the necessity with true womanly feeling. And yet, if after a thorough investiga- tion, she should be convinced that duty to her child required it at her hands-that the eternal good of the precious immortal that God had committed to her charge demanded it, she would forego and undergo all, to comply with the requirements of the blessed Saviour. Thus she reasoned. Thus she decided. "       ^     76       EJvangel Wiseman. e CHAPTER VI. THE BABY-ARGUMENTS PRO AND CON. "E little Vernon was a L"perfect beauty." So the whole household declared, from grandpapa, who was usually very reticent about such " small fry," as he laughingly called the little folks-to Bridget Mahoney, the Irish cook, who, whenever she had a spare moment, would rush up stairs into Mrs. Wiseman's room, and there, bend- ing as gracefully as she could over the little crib, would indulge in all the compliments to the baby that her fertile Irish wit could suggest, vowing "it was, be shure, the very swatest, and purtiest, and darest little chreayture in al the wide, wide world." Bridget Mahoney was a character. She had come with Evangel that beautiful spring evening when she- came to take possession of her new home, and had remained with her faithfully ever since. Why she had staid so long no one could divine. She always appeared content, and as she did her work well and promptly, Evangel had no occasion to desire change. Indeed she had grown to feel a deep interest in her. Bridget was, it is true, quite free and easy. Wholly unconscious was she of the etiquette -that required quiet demeanor in the presence of her supe- riors. She said just what she felt, for she never troubled herself particularly to think. Impulsive and, for Irish blood, pretty amiable, with good health and good resolution, she was a magnificent "help." She never scolded-a capital trait. Nor did she sulk. When annoyed, as sometimes she was, she would   The Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.

Bridget was a character, as we have said, and Bridget was a true Roman Catholic. "Now fir the church an' the blessid sacrimint of baptism be shure, Miss Wiseman, for this leetle maun," she said to the mother, when the child was about three weeks old. "Oh, how me shoold like to see Father Kelly baptize him  Your praste don't belave in baptism, Miss Wiseman " "Oh, yes, Dr. Eaton does, Bridget, but not in sprinkling; neither for children nor their parents. You know, we Baptists go down under the water, Bridget. We think this alone is baptism." "Yas, yas, so I have heerd. It seems so funny to me be shure, Miss Wiseman. I should fear me I would dhrown meself. Wal, wal, this leetle maun can no go under the wather, so he'll have to be sprinkled.

"Oh, Miss Wiseman, I cannot tell you how bad I have felt meself be shure, about that leetle darlintl You know, Miss Wiseman, what the church sais about them babies that were not baptizedl" and Bridget again crossed herself and muttered a prayer. Evangel sighed deeply, but made no answer. A tear fell on the face of the sleeping babe, as it lay in her lap. Bridget saw the mother's emotion, and quietly turned the subject by asking some trivial question relative to dinner. "I didn't know be shure," she said to herself, as she descended the stairway to the dining-room, "I didn't know be shure that the poor dare craythur would a took     78       .Evangel Wiseman. it so hard.

An' for shure if nobody will see to it I'll do it meself, an' I will. I kin any time step round to Fayther Kelly, an' have it all over anll' nobody know it at all, be shure." Not a day had passed since the little Vernon had -become the household deity, without frequent visits being made to ' Our Home," by the various members of Mr. Vernon's family. Beautiful presents were showered upon him, and tiny bouquets arranged in honor of himn. Aunt Delia manifested the greatest love and tenderest,solicitude for the babe. She seemed to feel it was all her own, and day and night she watched over it with a devotion beautiful to behold. Aunt Delia was very skillful in the handling of infants, and quite well versed in the juvenile materia medica of hot teas, lotions and cosmetics. It was marvelous to behold how many things Aunt Delia found necessary to the baby's well-being. And scarcely a day passed that pencil and tablet were not called into requisition to make mem- oranda for him; for Miss Delia soon found that whatever were Mr. Wiseman's gifts, he did not possess that of remembering the " notions," as -he classed everything that the ladies fancied desirable for Vernon's comfort and deve- lopment. "Now, Herbert, don't forget that list of things for Vernon! He really stands in need of every one of them!" Miss Delia would say after the father, from Ithe head of the steps, in a tone sometimes of the most pathetic entreaty, at others, if the things had been forgotten the day before, of most imperative command.   The Baby-wArguments Pro and Con.      79 "Herbert must be broken in," she would often say to Evangel. "What will he do as father of a family, forgetting everything that is absolutely needed I " In one particular, Miss Delia was remarkably sensible for one usually so fastidious. She would have the baby enjoy the fresh air, and never a day passed from the time it was a week old, that she did not give it a promenade on the gallery. This indispensable accessory to health she had learned from old Mrs. Queenlea, Lilly's English nurse. And then she would have him to sleep as much as he pleased. Every visitor to the house was not allowed to rush into the room to declare the babe " a paragon of perfection," "-the finest child in the world,"--" most beauti- ful eyes," " such fine, soft hair," and then "what dainty hands and feet," " and so like the father about the nose," "and just like the mother about the mouth," and " pre- cisely the father's chin and the mother's brow," as if the Master Workman had been driven to copying first father, then mother alternately, until the baby was fashioned. "No indeed; Aunt Delia would have none of this intrusion. She had read somewhere, in her rather promiscuous course, that some old physician had said, "plenty of milk, plenty of sleep, and plenty of flannel, and my word for it you will have a good child." Aunt Delia believed it. It was always her proemial in introducing a lecture on the proper method of nursing children. She had carefully read ' Combe on the Constitution of Man," his 'CManagement of Children," various essays on teething; had attentively perused "Hall's Journal of Health," had stowed away in her memory the various suggestions to be met with in the multifarious magazines of the day regarding the rearing of children; and from them all, she had elected a system of her own, which she believed to be perfect, and with which she -      80       Evangel Wiseman. allowed no one to interfere where she had control. Already she was gaining a famous reputation. Lilly modestly acted as nurse under Aunt Delia's careful supervision. She never wearied in admiring the ever-mul- -tiplying and developing beauties of this most wonderful babe, now doubly dear, because it was fully realized that he was mortal. The dimples, smiles, careless stretches, the wondrous look of the deep blue eyes, the nascent but unmistakable indications of extraordinary intelligence, which prognosticated a fame that should reach the bounds of the civilized world, and be commensurate with time itself,-all this Lilly's loving eyes saw, and a thousand other charms, which every day heightened and multiplied. The question of baptizing Vernon had repeatedly been discussed in his grandfather's family, and, as might be supposed, all favored it. Each one felt it should be done- it must be done; and each felt an individual responsibility connected with having it done. But, then, how could this be effected? It was believed Mr. [Wiseman would be uncompromisingly opposed to it. Mrs. Wiseman, it was supposed, would not particularly favor the step, now that she was a member of the Baptist church. Indeed it was questioned by all whether public baptism would be admin- istered to the child of Baptist parents by an Episcopal minister, even should the consent of the parents be obtained. Aunt Delia very readily took upon herself the manage- ment of the whole affair, provided the parents would agree that it might be done. If Dr. Cheney would not perform the rite, she would pledge herself to find some clergyman who would. 'JAnd in event none could be obtained, she would do it herself rather than the babe should die without it. "She would take it to a Catholic priest, or anywhere else, rather than it should die, as Herbert had done, without   The Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.      81 baptism." Her mind, she declared, was made up on this point, and, moreover, if the parents would not consent, she believed it to be her imperative duty to have it done without their knowledge. Why, brother ." she added, as she sprang from her seat and confronted Mr. Vernon, who had suggested that perhaps this course would be too extreme, don't you see, if baptism is a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby they that rightly receive it are grafted into the Church, and if a child, coming to the holy baptism, receives remission of sin by spiritual regeneration-if he is made a member of Christ and a child of God by baptism-and we know that he is, for the Church tells us so-and there is no other way for him to get to heaven-is it not our duty to see that this dear little helpless one is made safe for eternity, even if his parents do oppose it? Oh, what an awful judgment it will be upon us who know what is right, if we fail to do it I I could not live if Vernon should die as Herbert did I Mr. Vernon was sorely perplexed. He knew not how to reply to his sister's argument. He had either to repudi- ate the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, or admit her conclusion. The first he could not do. He was a high churchman, and had too long subscribed to them. The latter he was unwilling to do, because it decided the hopeless destiny of the little Herbert, and made it impera- tive on them, as Miss Delia had suggested, to have Vernon baptized as soon as possible. Mr. Vernon saw and appreciated, for the first time in his life, the force of the fearful teachings of his church on this point, and it caused him to think in a manner he had never before done. Miss Delia awaited a reply; but none was made. Mrs. 5 oz       fivanget - zseman. Vernon did not at all favor the idea of usurping authority in religious matters, and she felt the parents would never consent. She had never for a moment suspected that her daughter had any thought that the babe should be sprinkled, and she knew that Mr. Wiseman's deeply seated opposition could not be overcome. Lilly fully coincided with Aunt Delia, and urged, in view of Herbert's sad fate, that Vernon should be baptized with- out delay. "You are right, Aunty; our precious darling must be baptized, even if you should do it yourself; I cannot bear the thought that he should be neglected as the other little one was." And the agitated girl buried her flushed face in her delicate white hands and shuddered with the terrible thought. It was enough for Miss Delia; she knew Lilly would prove a most efficient coadjutor, for she was dearly beloved by her sister and her husband. Thus encouraged, Miss Delia made hasty preparations to return to "Our Home," from which she had been absent only a few hours. Her mind was fully imbued with the weighty character of the duty devolving upon her, and she determined within herself not to rest a moment until she ascertained what could be done, and when. She knew she should find Mr. Wiseman at home, for, with loving consideration for his wife, he spent all the time he could command from his business with her, thus enabling her to pass the days most agreeably. He was never weary of waiting on her, preparing pleasant surprises, and reading to her from her favorite authors. And she so fully appre- ciated his every effort, that the mutual joy was mutually heightened. The two had just dined.  At Evangel's request the repast had been served in her room, that she   D Tle Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.     83 might have the pleasure of partaking of it with her hus- band, while she overlooked the baby, the care of which devolved on her in the absence of Miss Delia. Bridget had not yet removed the dishes. Herbert and Evangel- the babe resting cosily in her arms -were sitting in front of the open window, enjbying the beautiful sub- urban prospect beyond. He had been reading to her, before dinner, from that beautiful work of the younger Bicker- steth, "Yesterday, To-day and Forever;" and their souls were elevated and subdued into unison with its lofty and beautiful spirit, until they thrilled with exquisite delight. Through the foliage of the forest trees that shaded the sacred grounds of Elmwood, they caught glimpses of the marble shafts that marked the tombs in that city of the dead, where the body of their little Herbert lay sleeping. It needed no words to convey the thoughts and feelings of these saddened hearts to each other. Instinctively, they felt that they possessed one common thought, and that thought was of the dead. Aunt Delia entered the room; her manner was unwont- edly energetic, and a highly flushed appearance marked her face; but as the day was unusually warm, no partic- ular importance was attached to her unusually perturbed look. She was pleasantly welcomed, and Mr. Wiseman, rising, handed her a comfortable chair, where she could be refreshed by the passing breeze. All the way over, Miss Delia had been assiduously debating in her mind how  she should introduce the momentous subject. She had determined it should be done, and done that very afternoon. Vernon should be baptized; his eternal destiny hung on this event. It must be attended to speedily, because he might be snatched away i,     84       Evangel Wiseman. at any moment, and she was resolved that soon, either publicly or privately, officially or unofficially, this child should be made an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven by the only act that could secure this important state. Call her not a fanatic I She fully believed what she had been taught by her church, and the fault was not in her zeal, but in the false instructions she had received. It had never occurred to her mind that it was possible for her church tenets to be unscriptural. Miss Delia paused several minutes, in which she was endeavoring to arrange her ideas so as to present the subject most appropriately. She knew it would not avail to make a direct attack. This would only produce direct opposition. So she had recourse to what she considered a coup de main.  Approaching Evangel, she took the boy from her lap and kissed it tenderly. Then gazing into its little white, chubby face with a look of saddest pity, she said, in pathetic tone- "My dear little Vernon, my darling little child! who will attend to your best interests, if 'Aunty' doesn't?" "Why, aunt Delia! what is the matter "With Vernon?" asked the mother in surprise. Miss Delia hesitated a moment, all the while looking most pityingly on the babe she was holding in her arms. Turning quickly around, and advancing a step or two towards Evangel, she replied, as she pressed the babe most earnestly to her bosom: "Evangel, this child ought to be baptized,-must be baptized I It is your duty to have it done, and that as soon as possible. Your parents think so, Lilly thinks so, and everybody thinks so. And it is a sin against his eternal welfare to neglect it. Herbert may have some squeamish ideas about the propriety of it, but I tell you, it is your just duty to have it donel"   XI IThe Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.          85 Mrs. Wiseman started in her chair. Had an electric shock from a powerful battery been sent unexpectedly and through her frame, she could not have been more startled. The attack was so unlooked for, so abrupt, so direct, she could not reply. Instinctively, she turned to her husband, who was glancing over the pages of the book he held in his hand. His attention had been arrested by Miss Delia's novel remarks to the baby, and by her unexpected disclosure. Supposing his wife did not care to enter into a contro- versy with Miss Vernon on a point of such vital differ ence, he came to her rescue: "Have Vernon baptized, aunty And what for? That little, helpless babe, that doesn't know his right hand from his left? Why, he couldn't stand to be baptized l" he added, laughing, rising from his chair and approach- ing Miss Delia, as she held the baby on her lap beside the farther window. "Yes, Mr. Wiseman, have Vernon baptized " she reite- rated, with decided emphasis.   "It is high time that this question was settled and the thing done." "The question is settled, aunty. The baby is in a safe condition.   Why, then, should  we have him sprinkled?" "Why, that you may do your duty to him, and he :be saved!" she replied with unusual warmth. IThe reply shocked Evangel; her face blanched, as the thought of her dear little "unbaptized"Herbert rushed to her mind. It was the first expression she had heard that cast doubt on the happiness of his future state. How often she had felt it, but had never dared put it in words  "If Vernon must be baptized to save him, what must be the destiny of Herbert, who had passed t        pse     86       Evangel Wiseman. away unbaptizedl"Tears started to her eyes, but she suppressed them, for she would not have her husband aware of her unsettled views. She looked at him beseech- ingly, and awaited his reply. "It is not possible, aunty, that you deem it neces- sary to Vernon's salvation that he should be baptized?" Mr. Wiseman looked at her with mingled surprise and earnestness, as he asked' the question. "Indeed I do, Herbert, I know it islI And so would you, if you had not been so falsely taught. I have studied this question night and day, and can not be mistaken about it now. And I tell you, and Evangel, if you don't have Vernon baptized, then I shall feel it my duty-my solemn duty--to see that it is done. His eternal safety shall not be jeopardized!" As she concluded the last sentence, Miss Vernon fixed a steady gaze on the marble shafts of Elmwood, which rose up to her view. She had spoken with the most unmistakable earnestness. She had not intended to betray her feelings and plans, but her soul was stirred within her, and she could no longer brook badinage and opposition on a subject so momentous. "Come, aunty  don't grow excited over it. Let us talk calmly about it, if it is so important as you seem to regard it. Youl tell us you have been studying this question too long to be mistaken on it. Do tell me where you find this doctrine, and this duty required. I have never been enabled to discover any proper authority for it in all my reading of the Bible-Old or New Testament-.?' "' None so blind, Mr. Wiseman, as those who 'will not seel' I find it taught everywhere. Nothing can be plainer than it is. The Church teaches it-the Bible teaches it-   I X       The Baby-Arguments    Pro and Con.    87 it has been taught in all ages, and by all Christian pro- fessors-except you Baptists." !"I certainly have been very much at fault in all my reading; for I have searched diligently for it in the Bible, but could never find it." "And that is just because you wouldn't. The Bible is full, of it, and the Church teaches it in the plainest language." "What Church, aunt Delia?" "Why, all the churchesI Every one of them, from the Catholic down to these Methodists. I have been reading their creeds, and catechisms, and doctrines, for the last year, all of them-and I find it in every one. And I know it is right-must be right  I therefore iinsist that Vernon be baptized without delay." Evangel listened breathlessly. Could her husband but have looked into her anxious, throbbing heart, and there read her doubts, her fears, her earnest searchings for the truth on this subject, he would have treated it with more consideration for her sake-would have endeav- ored to remove all her wearing solicitude. But he had no conception of the fearfully disturbed condition- of her mind; and his only effort was to -quiet Miss Vernon's unfounded apprehensions as quickly as possible. "You tell me, aunty, that the Church-all the churches -in all ages of the world, have taught infant baptism; but do you find it in the Word of God?   You know it is there we must look for authority and instruction in everything that relates to the salvation of our souls." "Assuredly I do, Mr. Wiseman! And so would you if you would only read aright. Dr. Cheney says the Bible is full of it; and I know it is, too; and as clear as full. Why, Mr. Wiseman, haven't all the churches, in all the  88       Evangel - Wiseman. ages, been guided by the Bible? and how could they know their duty if they didn't find it in the Scriptures of Divine truth?" "I have read thet Bible as carefully as any Pope or Bishop-carefully and searchingly, both Old and Newt Testaments-and I find no command for, nor example of, ' infant baptism '" "Well; then you must have a version of your own 1 Everybody else finds it, but your people ; and they don't see it just because they don't want to. For I tell you it is there!" Miss Delia's voice had reached its highest key-note. Her eyes were unusually dilated. She had forgotten the babe was in her lap. Evangel listened with painful atten- tion. Would she now receive any light on this subject, that had so fearfully occupied her mind for months, and which still remained so e/mbarrassed with uncertainty? Observing Miss Delia's excessive agitation, she advanced and offered to relieve her of the baby.  v"No, no, Evangel; let him alone!  I want to keep him, that he may plead for me and himself in this cause?"--And bending over the unconscious babe, she kissed its sweet face with the greatest tenderness, saying, half audibly:-"No, no! Papa will not have his little one baptized, just because he does not wish to." "Do not wish to, aunt Delia? Do you suppose for a moment that I would neglect anything that would guar- antee my child's salvation, provided I could understand that God's Word commands it? There is nothing I would not do, let it be attended by whatever difficulties it might, if I could believe that God enjoined it upon me I Mr., Wiseman spoke, gravely, and with deep feeling. Evangel started at his words, and the tears again rushed *    The Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.      89 to her eyes. "If he shall ever be convinced that baptism is right, he will have my baby baptized," she said to herself. It was a ray of hope. It could do no harm, and it might be necessary. "Could I find a command in the Word of God," con- X tinued Mr. Wiseman, with increasing earnestness, for the administration of any rite whatever, whether circum- cision, baptism, pouring or sprinkling, or anything else, I should not hesitate a moment to have it properly attended to. But a command for either the baptism or sprinkling of babes I cannot see. Nowhere do I find authority for this ordinance, either positive or implied. If you have found it, aunt Delia, or any one else has discovered it, I shall be glad to have it pointed out to me. Rest assured I am always open to conviction." Then will my darling be baptized I exclaimed Miss Delia enthusiastically, pressing the babe to her bosom, and kissing it rapturously. Her face beamed with delight. She felt she had assuredly secured her object. "Now, Mr. Wiseman, you have promised me that if the command to baptize children -is in the Bible, this little lamb shall be baptized forthwith I You are witness, Evangel, to this thing!  "Yes, I do promise you, if you will show me the com- mand, that it shall be done, and that forthwith. Now, here is a Bible, point me the place! I am most anxious to read it, for it has escaped me, notwithstanding I have diligently searched for it I Here, Evangel dear, hold Vernon while aunty finds the place I " "No, no, I'm not going to give up the baby. I just want to ask you one question, Herbert, and that will settle it, without my finding places. Didn't Christ Himself com- mand it?"     90       Evangel Wiseman. "I have never so read. Where can it be found?"  "Didn't He Himself pronounce these- words of command? You know He did, Mr. Wiseman, as well as I -do: ' Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' You can turn to the place yourself. You know it is there! Now what more do you want to convince you?" and Miss Delia looked triumphantly at her antagonist. ( Why, aunt Delia, it is not possible that you pretend to find any authority in these words of our blessed Saviour for the practice of ' infant sprinkling'?" "Why, certainly I do, Herbert!" a Where?" "Where? Why, all the way through!" and she kissed the little treasure with an unequivocal look of triumph. Mr. Wiseman observed this movement, so significant of Miss Delia's feelings, and quietly smiling with a degree Of naivete quite noticeable to Evangel, but altogether unobserved by Miss Vernon, who felt " her proof was so convincing that it could not possibly be set aside," replied: "Why, aunty, there is no baptism in these words, not even an allusion to it I " "No baptism, Herbert! What do you mean?" and Miss Delia started from her chiair with surprise, quite jeopardiz- ing the safety of the baby. "No baptism!" she repeated with terrible energy, her face coloring deeply. "Why, if that isn't an express command, for it, I don't know where you'll find it!" "Nor I, aunty. But I am very sure it is not here, neither positive not inferential." "Why, Mr. Wiseman, doesn't Christ explicitly say, 'Suffer little children to come unto me'? Now I would ask you, how can they come if not in baptism?"   The Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.      91 "Why, in any other way far better than in baptism. Little children like Vernon can " come " only in death. When they are old enough to understand, they can come by prayer, by reading God's Word, by meditating upon it, by learning of Jesus, by praise, by confession of sin. Chil- dren are as able to come in either of these ways, as in baptism. Infants cannot come in any way until they are taken to heaven. ' There is no baptism in this place, aunty; you must produce other authority.' " "Mr. Wiseman, let me ask you, don't you think children, --infants and all,- are made members of Christ and inher- itors of the kingdom of heaven, by baptism, and that alone?" "No, aunt Delia, 1 know they are not. The ordinance of baptism, even if commanded for infants, which it is not, has no power to regenerate the soul and make it fit to inherit eternal life." "Well, I'd like for you to tell me what does fit chil- dren for heaven if it is not baptism. The Church says this does it, and I know the Church cannot teach a false thing." "i Baptism, I assure you, does not fit them, even if the Church does teach so, -it cannot do,it. Nowhere in the Bible is baptismal regeneration taught; not even in the case of those who, in obedience to the command of the Saviour, (having previously believed on Him) submit to this rite which He ordained for His disciples. And surely there can be no change of nature produced with the babe by the sprinkling of a little water in its face, while it remains wholly unconscious of what is being done. The object of 'baptism, aunty, is not to regenerate." "Well, Herbert, I'd like to know how children are to be saved, then. For my part, I've no hope for them if they  "       92       Evangel Wiseman. are not baptized. They must be in Christ's kingdom if they get to heaven, and if they are not brought into it by baptism, I cannot see how they get in. The Church teaches this, and I know it is so and there is no other way." Evangel's heart stood motionless as she gazed away across the fields upon the spot where slept the " unbaptized " form of her precious first born, and realized that the Church did teach, the doctrine that her aunt was so zealously defending. It was a trial moment to her. The Tempter was so busy with her fears and prejudices. She was on the very verge of despair; yet she spoke not, only a silent cry, "Lord, help me." "You are certainly mistaken, aunty." Evangel sighed! It was some relief. "You torture the Scriptures to make them support dogmas which men, through ignorance of the plan of salvation and the rich provisions of the com- plete atonement of our blessed Saviour, have introduced and perpetuated, that they may aid by their puny efforts the Omnipotent One in His own work. What presump- tion! what consummate folly! Children, aunty, must be saved as their parents are, by the atonement of Christ- through the provision made for them on Calvary. They are saved,- they can be saved--in no other way. "And do not need baptism, Herbert? Oh, how hard you are to convince! Adults are baptized; children must be baptized; it is Christ's command. I have given it to you in plain words, and now you have gone and gotten up a theory of your own about atonement, which you nor anybody else can prove; which is not in the Bible, and which no church on earth teaches, or has ever taught. I quote the Scriptures to show you that children are to come to Christ in baptism, and prove to you that it is a positive command, and you say there is no baptism about it. If   you will shut your eyes to this glorious truth, you will have it to do; but I tell you now, that I am not going to be led astray by your false doctrine and let this baby perish." "Do you think all the unbaptized babies have perished, aunt Delia?" "How can I believe anything else?" And that when there is no command for baptizing them?" "Haven't I given you the command in plain words?" There is no mention of baptism in the words -of the Saviour which you have quoted, and if you have no other authority than this, you will have to renounce your cher ished dogma. And I assure you that until better proof for the practice is adduced than you have given, I must tell you candidly Vernon cannot be sprinkled. I believe that Christ knew what was necessary for the salvation of infants, and that He was not unmindful of that class of His creatures, so large a proportion of which pass from the earth into another state of existence, but has made necessary provi- sions for their eternal happiness without any aid from poor helpless mortals. And believing this, I cannot be found furnishing expedients which reflect on the wisdom and goodness of Him who came to atone for the sins of the world." Evangel breathed more freely. Yes, her own dear child was saved without baptism. The blood of Christ had opened the way to heaven for unconscious babes like hers. But may it not be enjoined on me as a duty i It must be taught somewhere in the Bible, otherwise Christian men and women would not practice it. It certainly was not taught in the passage aunt Delia had quoted, but then it must be found somewhere.     "       Evangel Wiseman. Miss Delia was utterly thwarted on her favorite passage. She could not at all meet Mr. Wiseman's inferences. So she sat a moment in silence; then rallying, exclaimed with pointed emphasis: "I tell you, Mr. Wiseman, the baptism of children is taught in the Bible I I know it is! And Vernon must and shall be baptized I I'll convince you yetl Don't you say so, Evangel?"It was the first time Miss Vernon had appealed to her niece, for hitherto she had felt quite strong in " proof." "Say, Evangel, musn't Vernon be baptized? You know it is our duty to see that it is done, for I don't believe Herbert will ever be convinced I " She looked at Evangel inquiringly, but she did not reply. "It must be done, and that straightway. Death is in the land. This darling may be called away any day. And if you do not approve of it, Mr. Wiseman, I must have it done myselfl I will take all the responsibility I ' "Whys aunty, I don't suppose any one would sprinkle the child under such circumstances. Both parents opposed to it!" "'Leave all that to me, sir. If this is the only thing in the way, I can soon have the matter settled, if you will only promise me not to interfere. I know Evangel will not. I pledge myself to find some one who will do it properly. .You must admit, Herbert, that if it does no good, it can't possibly do any harm." "I hold that it does a great deal of harm, aunt Delia. The sprinkling of children has been productive of untold ,evil. It has fearfully corrupted the churches; has thrown contempt on God's plan of redemption, by ascribing regen- erating efficacy to a ceremony not taught ill the Scriptures, and nowhere enjoined by God's Word." l'As I have said before, this is only your opinion, Mr.   The Baby-Arguments Pro and Con.      95 Wiseman," replied Miss Delia, speaking with marked warmth; "and you have no right, I insist upon it, to set up your views against the plain teachings of the Church. I maintain that infant baptism is taught in the Scriptures, and all Christians know it is so but you Baptists, that can't find anything there but your dipping." "Aunty, if you can find one place in the whole Bible where this practice is enjoined, I pledge you that Vernon shall be baptized publicly, if you can find any one to do it, and that without delay." " That is all I ask, Herbert." Miss Delia's voice was 'quite modulated: indeed it was decidedly euphonic. "I know the child will be baptized now, for I know there is Bible authority, although I may not just now be able to produce it. But Dr. Cheney can. By the way, Herbert, would you object to a conversation with the Doctor on this subject? I am convinced he can make it clear as noon-day to your mind,and then he will remove any crotchets that may have crept into Evangel's brain." "No objection whatever; would be pleased to do so; for if he has any proof that can convince me that any- thing I can do, will, without equivocation, guarantee the salvation of my child, I shall hear him gladly, and, 1hen covinced shallact prmptly1     96       Evangel Wiseman. CHAPTER VII. PROGNOSTICS.  'r HE door-bell rang; Bridget answered promptly, and, finding that the visitors were, Lilly Vernon and her friend Annie Chiles, invited them, sans ceremonie, up into Mrs. Wiseman's apartment. ' Well, Lilly," said Mr. Wiseman, after the usual amount of caressing and questioning was gnished, "I have received a letter from a class-mate of mine, a splendid fellow-one of ability, integrity and position, and, by-the-way, magnificent in personnel--and he informs me that it is his intention to pass some weeks in Chester during the summer, if he can possibly make his business arrangements to that effect." "Well, brother, that is decidedly promising. It will give a little life to our very quiet circle, which really needs something to wake it up. But where is this paragon of excellence and beauty from?" - 'He is located in New Orleans; and, having been very closely confined to his business through the winter, feels it necessary to recreate awhile. So I shall I invite him to pass his vacation with us. And now, if you and Miss Annie desire an eligible match, I advise that you prepare yourselves for the onslaught." "It will not do for Lilly and I to be rivals, Mr. Wiseman, we are too good friends." 'Ah! he is victor who wins, Annie. And hear me- no coquetting, no jealousies. Hear me, Lilly?" ' To be sure-to be sure. You understand, Annie; each one for herself-do you accept the situation?"   Prognostics.         97 , With all my heart! and shall triumph if possible." "Just let me ask one question," interrupted Miss Delia, tucking away the baby which at last, afterl many starts and jumps, had fallen asleep.' If the poor little martyr could have spoken, doubtless he would have said: "Please stop this discussion till I nap a little; babies of my age need sleep more than they do baptism!"I want to ask," continued Miss Delia, folding down the blanket, "if your charmin" Southern friend is a Baptist?" Each one present roared with laughter. "Hush-sh-sh!" said Miss Delia, patting the baby and rocking the cradle. "You can laugh as much as you please," she resumed, assured the baby was now in dream-land; "but I just tell you, and I mean what I say--mark it,--that if he is, Lilly Vernon lshall not think of him for a moment. She is an Episcopalian, and shall never change. All the doctrines of the -Church are rooted and grounded in her, and can't be worked out." Miss Delia desired to appear facetious, but she was in " deep earnest." "But you must tell us his name, Mr. Wiseman?" interrupted Evangel, wishing to divert Miss Delia's mind from her hobby. "William Carlton. A very good cognomen, young ladies, is it not? I don't know, Auntyj whether he is a Baptist or not. But this I -can avouch, that whatever he may be, hb is that intelligently and conscientiously. You will all find him eminently interesting. Few men I have met with equal him. And I shall not be the least surprised if aunt Delia is not the first to fall in love with him, albeit he is a Baptist." "Girls, what do you say; if it is found that he is an opposer of infant sprinkling and a believer in immersion, will this stand against him?"        6     98        -Evangel Wiseman. - "Not with me, Mr. Wiseman," promptly answered    i Annie, laughing at Miss Delia's start.  "If he is only such a Baptist as you are, I shan't for a moment object., You know I am an Episcopalian, as all my friends before me were, but I assure you that with such a prize to gain, X I shall not, like Miss Delia, stickle on this point. I do n't  know a great deal about your denomination, Mr. Wiseman, X but I assure you, if Mr. Carlton be as exquisite as you represent him-and I do not doubt it--I shall wholly   i ignore religious differences and captivate him if I can," And the beautiful and artless girl laughed merrily at her  frank avowal, and blushing deeply, turned to Evangel with d an air of naivete, asking, "Would you, Mrs. Wiseman, make this any objection to Mr. Carlton, if he prove all X Mr. Wiseman has pictured him?" "Oh, by no means, Annie," she replied, waking from  the little reverie into which she had fallen, respecting the results of the proposed visits, that of Dr. Cheney and that  of Mr. Carlton. "You know, Annie, I think Baptists are a very good kind of people," she added, Idokingz laugh- ingly at aunt Delia, who stood in majesty beside the win- dow ready for any attack. "So -far as I am acquainted with them, they are both intelligent and scriptural." "Pshaw! what do you know about ' scriptural,' Evan-  gel!" interposed Miss Delia with a toss of the head. "And, Annie, if my husband's friend be all he says, if I were a young lady, and 'Episcopalian' at that, I  should not object to him even if he should prove to be a Baptist." "Oh, girls, you mast take all aunty says of us Baptists curm grano salts. She estimates us much more highly than she would have you believe. True, she regards us as slightly wanting in Bible knowledge, because we cannot   Prognostics.         99 find infant sprinkling in the words, ' suffer little children to come unto me,' and also a little outre because we ' dip,' as she denominates baptism; but throw these differences out of the' way and she likes us pretty well." Miss Delia scarcely knew how to take this "piquant" speech of Mr. Wiseman, and as he took up his hat to leave the room, she did not venture on a reply, but remained standing and twitching at that left cuff. Mr. Wiseman bowed the ladies a good afternoon and ran down stairs., "I do wish Herbert was a rational man!" ejaculated Miss Delia, resigning her position at the window and tripping towards- the cradle. "You may bring direct Scripture proof to show him that infant baptism is right and he will not be convinced-just boldly and defiantly says 'it's not there."' "What, aunty, have you and brother been discussing this subject?" asked Lilly with evident interest. "I have been enjoining on him the necessity of having this child baptized. But, pshaw,"-- "And did he consent, Miss Delia?" inquired Annie, earnestly. She had become very much interested in Bap- tists and baptism, since hearing of Mr. Carlton. "But I need not ask such a question--of course he negatived your proposition, Miss Delia." "Of course he did, Annie. He can't be convinced, or rather he won't. He said if I could show any-authority for it in the Bible, he will have Vernon baptized forthwith. Didn't he, Evangel?"  The mother bowed smiling assent. -" and this you know is a wonderful admission for him; I never knew a Baptist that would go even this far. But mind you, he will contend there is neither injunction nor example there. I brought positive proof in the words of ,%     100   -   Evangel Wiseman.             the Saviour Himself, 'Suffer the little children and forbid : them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdon  of heaven;' and he just said there was not a word of  baptism in it. But he can be convinced; I know he can I j I am determined that Dr. Cheney shall come and explain  the whole subject clearly and fully. I. know he can't refute the Bishop's arguments, nor positively contradict him. : The Bishop is well posted, having written so much about i it. What a pity that some people think they know so much I But I'm thankful that it has been thus far so  easily settled. I had expected much greater difficulty,  for I thought Herbert would never consent, even if he should be fully convinced that the Scriptures taught it. But then, I had determined it should be done, if I had to do it myself; for I will never think of letting this little one die without baptism, as the other did." And as Miss Delia delivered herself of this emphatic utterance, she changed  her position and tugged at that cuff.  "Oh, I do hope brother will consent. I am so anxious  it shall be done. How beautiful the darling will look, the prettiest baby of them all! But, sister, you haven't made a robe nor bought a cap for him. I want him to be the finest as well as the prettiest child that has ever been baptized in our church. Come, Annie, won't you help us to get up a splendid wardrobe for him?"  "Certainly, Lilly, I'll do all I can." "Evangel, we have never said a word to you about this  thing," remarked Miss Delia to her niece, who sat smiling at Lilly's enthusiasm. "Of course, Evangel, you will have no objection if Herbert is convinced and consents?" "Not if I am convinced too, aunty." "We are sure you will be convinced, sister, if brother is  You know you used to think it was right to baptize children, and surely you can have no objection to it now!" v/      *I   Prognostics.        101 Evangel simply smiled in reply to Lilly's remark. Her mind was too unsettled on this point to allow her to express any opinion, and until fully decided she would not commit herself to any course of action. "C Oh, me; I forgot to say a word about it this evening to Herbert. I do wonder if he is gone " exclaimed Miss Delia, rushing to the front window, and looking out. "I am so anxious the Bishop shall come before the Baptists have that great meeting they have been so long speaking of. I suppose that when that wonderful preacher comes- what is his name, Evangel?" "Rev. Mr. Earle."  Well, when the Rev. Mr. Earle comes, there will be no hope for Vernon then until the excitement wears off. Her- bert's brain will then be turned topsy-turvy, sure enough. Everything must be done before that preacher gets here, or it will never be done. They do say he is a wonderful man, and makes everybody do and say just as he thinks and says; and he is 'such a Baptist, tooI' When does he come, Evangel?" "He will be here in June, about three weeks hence." "Well, girls, I am just now going to lay embargo on your going to hear him preach. Of course, Evangel will have to attend! But I shall not go. And Lilly and Annie, you will not go, surely. You are not so silly as to place yourselves where you will hear everything you believe, and hold sacred and true, ridiculed and misrepresented." Why, aunty!" exclaimed Evangel with a look of sur- prise on her sweet face, "Certainly you don't suppose that, because Mr. Earle is a Baptist minister, he spends his time in attacking the views of others and misrepresenting them? I am told he never does this. He preaches the Gospel and leaves controversy alone. All classes of people go to hear him, and all are well pleased."     102       Evangel Wiseman. "Well, well, this may be so; hope it is. But I shall not go, that's certainI And Dr. Cheney will not. Who ever heard of an Episcopalian Bishop at a Baptist meeting?" and Miss Delia sneered quite perceptibly. "Are they holier than Baptist ministers, aunt Delia, that they thus stand aloof from all participation in our efforts to advance the Redeemer's kingdom?" asked Evangel earn- estly, touched by her auntCill-timed remark. u' Oh, no, no; not this exactly I But then you know, we Episcopalians' never do associate with other denomina- tions " -"Your motto, aunty, is, I suppose, 'Stand by thyself l come not near to me, for I am holier than thou " "This has always been our custom, Evangel, as you very well know. When did you ever go into a Baptist church before you were married?" "But, aunty, perhaps I was wrong in this? The Bible says of just such persons as stand aloof from everybody because they think they are holier: ' These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.' So you see, aunty. the Lord is not pleased with them if they are with them- selves." "Why, Evangel, you have grown quite conversant with the Scriptures since you have turned Baptist I " Just at this juncture Miss Delia espied Mr. Wiseman pass- ing down the walk to the front gate. "Oh, Mr. Wiseman I  Mr. Wiseman!" she called out to him- at the pitch of her voice, " see here, we entirely forgot to appoint the evening for the Bishop's visit! When shall it be?" "Suit yourself and the Doctor's convenience. I shall be glad to hear him at any time."  Very well, then. Suppose we say next Thursday week? I desire that we shall all be -present at the discussion. And    i I            .Prognostics.        103 now, Herbert, I want you to be sure to remember it, and not make any other engagement.1" He bowed assent and passed on. "I designated the time for your convenience, EV/angel. By Thursday week you will be well and strong. I am Very anxious you shall hear every word of this debate, for I am of opinion -that you don't understand this subject as well as you used to. It seems to me your mind is'-fearfully confused, of late." "Oh, I understand it far better than I did formerly. Then I asked no questions about it, but took it for granted that it was all right, because I had always been taught so. But now since I have been studying the Bible, I am in serious doubt if there is any divine authority for it. But I admit my views are quite confused, and I am more than desirous that it shall be made entirely clear." "Tut, tut, Evangel Vernon-how strangely you talk- you who have been raised in the very bosom of the Church, now to be doubting scriptural authority for infant baptism I How easily some people's heads are turned! Just let them fall in love with a man, and they'll believe anything he tells them, however preposterous I Girls, never marry a Baptist, or you'll be like Evangel, running after all sorts of heresies, and notions I Why, Evangel," continued Miss Delia, rock- ing the cradle to keep baby down, who had been aroused by her excited tones, " the Bible, I tell you, is full of infant baptism! Didn't the passage I quoted prove it? It is taught from Genesis to the last book-what is it-" "Revelation, aunty." "Yes, from first to last it is full." "Where, aunty?" "Why, everywhere, Evangel! Why do you ask such a question? But I can't stop here to discuss with you.   104      EI vangel Wiseman. You'll be just as hard to convince as your husband. The BiShop will make it clear as noon-day sun when he comes, and then I hope you and Herbert will let your children be baptized without all this talking and trouble. I will run down now and see to Bridget a moment. I want her to cook these birds nicely for Herbert, and then I'll step over to the Bishop's and tell him all about the matter, so that he may be fully prepared. Herbert is pretty well posted on his side, and then he is so determined. The Bishop will find him a pretty hard party." "We are going over to see Fannie, and we will tell the Doctor for you." "No, no, Lilly; I can't intrust this matter to you and Annie. It's too important, entirely. I shall never get Vernon baptized in the world unless I attend to it myself. So you be seated. Here, Lilly, rock the cradle I - Don't let the baby wake. His nap 's not half out yet, and I'll run down a few minutes; then I'll be ready to go with you." Lilly rocked and rocked, but baby had no idea of sleeping all his time away, so he stretched and "grunted," and opened and shut his eyes, and smacked his mouth, until after a due round of performances he opened his large blue eyes and stared round, quite to the delight of the girls, who laughed and chatted and caressed him, until just a little whimper gathered round his mouth, which Lilly perceiving and supposing it could mean nothing but " supper," hast- ened him off to mamma. "There, now, baby dear, take that ugly screw out of those pretty lips," she said as she kissed him and deposited the little squirming form gingerly on the mother's knee. "Annie, is'nt he the sweetest baby you ever saw? Wouldn't he look beautiful in- robe and cap for baptism? Sister, please do let him be baptized soon. You know it   "; l[iiPrognostics.                   105 can't do any harm. He's quite old enough now to bear it, and it would be so beautiful to see him brought into the church I! It certainly is your duty to do this much for him I I don't see how anybody can think it is wrong thus to secure their eternal safety. I couldn't bear to see this little darling die without baptism!" and Lilly knelt down before the babe and taking the soft little hand in hers, kissed it again and again; Instinctively she realized the force of her words. She looked up into her sister's face. It betrayed no emotion. She was looking calmly out of the window toward Elm- wood. Her heart was bursting, but she spoke not. "Sister, you don't think it would be wrong to have Vernon baptized?" she asked, after a pause. Her tones betrayed the confusion she felt, at the thought of having wounded the sad heart. "Really, Lilly, I do not understand the matter sufficiently to'say what I believe. Herbert thinks it would be wrong. He says the practice has been productive of great evil." "Why, you surprise me, Mrs. Wiseman I " exclaimed Annie Chiles, starting from her seat beside the cradle, and taking position beside Lilly, who stood adjusting the flowers in the Parian vase resting on the table between the windows. "How can this be possible I I didn't know that Baptists believed this I I only thought they regarded it unnecessary. You can't think it is wrong?" "Annie, I do not know how to answer you. Having been taught from infancy that it is right and necessary, it is difficult I find for me to pronounce it wrong. And yet my husband gives good reasons for his views, which look con- cilusive. He believes it corrupts the Church." "Oh, my corrupts the Church! Why, sister, how can he suppose such a thing?" and Lilly let fall the beautiful    106       Evangel Wiseman. raceme -of lily of the valley which she was just ready to place in the vase. "Do tell us, sister, how this is?  "In the first place, he thinks it does incalculable evil by substituting it for the atonement of Christ in attaching to it regenerative power, and then by administering it to those of whom Christ never mentions it in connection with the ordinance. He thinks that it subverts the whole Gospel plan, as revealed in the New Testament, and feels that to give any aid in perpetuating it, is fearfully wrong." ' Well, I never looked at it in that light before, -Mrs. Wiseman, and I am not sure, that I fully comprehend what you have just said. Indeed I don't know much about it any way, but it has always seemed proper to me. The Church says it should be done, and it is good authority. I believe it is taught in the Bible, though I have never read it there. Don't you think it is, 1Mrs. Wiseman?" "Mr. Wiseman says it is not, Annie; that it cannot be found within the lids of the Bible; that the Scriptures nowhere enjoin it. I must confess that I do not know certainly for myself. I have never read it there, but then it may be.7" The door-bell rang. Bridget ran up, bringing a letter. It bore the post-mark of New Orleans. ' Mr. Carlton!" ejaculated Lilly, handing it to her sister, and seizing upon the baby so unceremoniously as to make Mrs. Wiseman shudder, exclaimed: "Read, sister, let us see when this young gentleman is coming. Oh, we are so anxious to know I " "You must wait, Lilly dear. It is directed to Herbert, and I never open his letters." "Too bad! too bad  Well, Annie, we are doomed to wait brother's return; so let's hasten over to see Fannie and be back to tea. We shall have to devise a thousand little plans to entertain him."   '      - I        Prognostics.       107 The door-bell rang again. "Mr. Nesbitt, ladies, wishes to say ye in the parlor, if ye plaze;" and Bridget doffed out as quickly as she had doffed in. "May I come over to the discussion, Mrs. Wiseman?" asked Annie Chiles, as she stooped to kiss the baby. ' I am so eager to hear what the Doctor and Mr. Wiseman will sajy." "Yes, Annie, you and Lilly must both come. I do not wish you to be as ignorant as I am." The girls ran down to meet Mr. Nesbitt in the parlor, leaving Miss Delia to tie on her bonnet and find her parasol and fan, two articles without which she never made her debut in public in summer time. "Glad to overtake yon, young ladies," remarked Mr. Nesbitt, after the bidding good afternoon. "I feared you would again escape me. The young gentlemen of Chester are going to give the young ladies a pic-nic next Tuesday, and the committee deputed me to call and see you, Miss Annie and Miss Lilly, and ask you to be present. We are going out about twelve miles on the cars, and think it will be a charming time." "Who of our friends are going, Mr. Nesbitt?" asked Lilly. "All, I suppose. I am to see a dozen; but have yet only called on Miss Fannie Eaton, Dr. Eaton's daughter, who is going. After seeing you I must call on Miss Fannie Cheney, Miss Maggie Ballou, Miss Mordaunt, -by the way, a splendid young lady. Didn't you think so, the day you called to see her at Mrs. Falkland's?" "We were both highly pleased, and do hope she will join the party, Mr. Nesbitt. "And Miss Dates Donaldson, Miss May Ford, Miss Lou   108    .  Evangel Wiseman. gopkins, etc., etc. So you see, young ladies, I shall be quite busy. I hope our young ladies will cultivate the acquaintance of our New Orleans belle; she is perfectly splendid, if she is Catholic." "Oh, Mr. Nesbitt, you don't mean to say that would make any difference with you?" "Indeed it would, Miss Annie; I just finished reading, last night, 'Priest and Nun,' and I tell you I don't want a wife who will go to confession and tell any ' Father' however pious, what she keeps concealed from me. If she were a good Episcopalian, now, I wouldn't pledge you that I shouldn't fall in love with her; but I assure you, Miss Annie and Miss Lilly, I shall never marry a Catholic. I'm wild I know, and this commtinity call me a rattling young fellow, but I'm too sharp to have such a woman as Mrs. Kemp for a wife; she would tell all her secrets to some Father Murphy, and defying my authority, bring untold trouble on us all." "Good evening, Willie," said Miss Delia, entering the parlor. "Come, now, don't leave because I have made my appearance." "Oh, not at all Miss Delia, I'm an errand boy for the pic-nic committee, this evening, and must discharge my duty." "Well, if you must leave, you can walk with us to the Bishop's." "Certainly, with pleasure; I intended to call on Miss Fannie, next. She is one of the dozen young ladies given to my charge, and I shall be most happy to accompany you, and Miss Lilly and Miss Annie." The quartette set out in fine spirits, and soon reached the Bishop's. Mr. Nesbitt and the young ladies paused at the hall-door; Miss Delia, as was her custom, pro- ceeded to the Doctor's study.   Prognostics.         109 He was not in, Mrs. Cheney informed her, but would be in a short time. He had been suddenly called upon to baptize a dying child of Mr. Pierson, a little boy of eight years, who had been sick for two weeks, with a slow typhus fever." "Why the delay, Mrs. Cheney; surely his parents cannot be church members." "They are not, Miss Delia. I believe have been. The mother was raised in the Church, but afterwards strayed off, I think to the Campbellites.  The father belonged to no organization. When the little fellow grew so ill they thought it would die, they sent for Dr. Cheney, and she insisted that it should be baptized this afternoon." a Well, I am glad, Mrs. Cheney, that some people come to their senses, if it is late. It does seem so strange to me that some now-a-days wander so far from the truth and can't be made to see it." "It is marvelous, Miss Delia, and very sad. I heard last week that another of our members, Mrs. Austin, is going to join the Baptists. You know she married -a Baptist husband several years since, and has been in the habit of attending his church with him frequently since then. Mrs. Warbeck tells me she is now going to unite with them. Would have done so long since, but they will not receive her on her baptism, although she has been immersed." "Been immersed and won't receive her? Well, ain't they, Mrs. Cheney, the most bigoted people in the world? Why, what objection can they have if she has been 'dipped'? I thought that was all thley required?" "No, it is not. It appears Mrs. Austin, early in her girlhood joined the Campbellite Church, as it is called, and was immersed by them. She afterwards came into our Church. We received her on her baptism, asking no questions about it. She has always been satisfied with  "O       Evangel Wiseman. her baptism, but the Baptists say that the Campbellites baptize for the remission of sins; that is, they believe in baptismal regeneration, which the Baptists will not subscribe to; and believing that the others fail altogether in the object, and also teach false doctrine, they will. not receive anybody who will not submit to being bap- tized by them." "Well, well! Isn't it too bad! Did you ever in all your life hear of such ignorant, bigoted and 'perverse people? No wonder they can't find infant: baptism in the Bible, if they are so narrow-minded as that!" "They have very intelligent ministers, Miss-Delia, and a very-intelligent membership, Dr. Cheney tells me. He says they are very consistent in their views and practices, and very independent too. For my part, I know very little about them personally. I was never in one of their churches but once in my life, and that was when I was quite young. One of our servant girls that I loved very much joined that Church, and my mother allowed my sister and myself to go to the baptism. It was all very strange to me, as you may wellimagine, and impressive, too. I recollect that I cried all the time, and I have never known why. I have often heard my mother speak of a great aunt of hers, who lived to an old age, who was a member of Dr. Gill's Baptist church in London, the very church to which the celebrated Spurgeon is now preaching. -She always spoke of her as exceedingly pious and intelligent." ' aYes, I suppose now and then you find one who is so, where they were connected with the families of church- men."  Leaving the two-ladies to their opinions while Miss Delia awaited the return of Dr. Cheney, let us look in upon Evangel, and see the state of her mind under the remarks that had been made by her husband and friends.   Prognostics.        1" Beside the open window, one shutter of which she had closed, to shut out the garish light, her head resting on her hand, and her sleeping babe on her knee, with hot tears streaming from eyes all used to weeping, with a look of perplexity and sadness amounting almost to despair, she sat 1 engaged in deep thought. Her heart was well-nigh break- ing, for the past, the present, the future, were raylessly dark to her bewildered mind. She felt to be in a maze from which she could never be extricated. The more the subject of infant baptism was discussed, the more painful- and obscure it became. "If what the Church teaches is true, then my child is not saved," she said to herself, while she sobbed aloud. "If not true, why should it have been taught by so many Christians in all ages of the world, and why should the prayer-book expressly inculcate baptismal regeneration? If unbaptized children are lost, what a fearful number there will be I Surely, God will not suffer them to perish because of the neglect of their parents? Many through ignorance had failed of their duty, if it were a duty. Would God shut out of heaven those poor little helpless ones? And yet to be consistent, He must do so if baptism made them inheritors. Perhaps, in cases where a want of knowledge had caused the omission, God in His mercy would overlook it; but with her, it could not be so. She had known the right (if it was right), and had failed to discharge her duty. She raised her eyes to look toward Elmwood. The tall white shaft over the grave of her grandmother, beside whom her precious Herbert lay, met her vision. Her tears flowed afresh, her bosom heaved with unspeakable anguish. She could not pray; she could not think intelligently; she could only feel the woe, of being the mother of a child lost through her neglect. She called to mind the comforting words of Dr. Eaton-the argument her husband had used with aunt     "2      ELvangel Wiseman. Delia of the full and free salvation through the blood of atonement, but her mind could not fully grasp it, and there- fore, while it kept her from absolute despair, it gave her no consolation. Had she but been taught the glorious doc- trines of the Gospel instead of the forms and ceremonies of the church;-had she from her childhood realized that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin, and not been taught to look to sprinkling and confirmation- now might she have had peace and joy in believing, instead of doubt and despair. She placed the sleeping babe in the cradle, her tears falling thick and fast. She must do something-must find relief. There was certainty, there was truth-THE; TRUTH. She would search for it until it was obtained. But how, or where could she begin? There was no one to lead her. She turned to her table. There was her Prayer-book. Instinctively she took it up and opened it, then laid it aside. - Before her were the-beautiful pocket Bible, the Concordance and Hymn-book her husband had presented her the day after her baptism. She had learned to search out, by the aid of the Concordance, such passages as she desired to read, but now she did not know what to look for. She laid beside the Prayer-book, the Concordance which she had taken up and opened. Mechanically she laid her hand on the Psalmist and turned its leaves, read- ing a few lines of several songs, until her eyes rested on that one which she had so often sung to herself when her heart was bowed with sorrow for the death of Herbert: "The pity of the Lord To those that fear His name, Is such as tender parents feel. He knows our feeble framed   Prognostics.         113 With tremulous voice and blinded eyes she sang it through, in a low plaintive tone, and then kneeling, she cried: "Lord, help me, for I am weak; Lord, guide me into the light, for I know not what to do. Oh I pity me, pity me, for I am overwhelmed with doubt and fear. Teach me what is right! Oi, by Thy Holy Spirit lead me into truth."  She remained bowed long after her lips ceased to move. The heart was pleading with God for light and strength. Rising, she turned to the Eighty-eighth Psalm, one she had so often read as a holy invocation, and then taking the hymn book, her- eyes rested on those sweet lines, so applicable to her case:  "Still nigh me, O my Saviour, stand, And guard in fierce temptation's hour. Support by Thy almighty hand,- Show forth in me Thy saving power, Still bB Thine arm my sure defence, Nor earth, nor hell, shall pluck me thence. "In suffering be Thy love my peace,- In weakness be Thy Jove my power, And when the storms of life shall cease, O, Saviour, in that trying hour, In death as life be Thou my guide,- And save one, who for me hast died." She had never seen them   before, but now they suited her, and she read them over and over. Oh, guide in fierce temptation's hour!" she repeated, clasping her hands, and turning her tear-stained face upward. Like Israel's leader on Mount Nebo, she was alone with God.  "4       Evangel Wiseman. 'Oh, Doctor, I'm so glad to see you," exclaimed Miss Delia, as Dr. Cheney made his appearance at the open door of his library. "I have such good news to tell you. Herbert has consented for Vernon to be baptized." The Doctor looked amazed as he wiped the perspiration from his face, and drinking the glass of cool water Mrs. Cheney handed him, rested himself in his large arm chair. "Why, Miss Delia, this cannot be possible. Mr. Wise- man consents for his baby to be baptized! I should as soon have expected an earthquake!"-and the Doctor drew his handkerchief a second time across his forehead. "What has so suddenly changed his views?" "Oh, he says, if you will show him any authority for it in the Bible, Vernon may be baptized immediately." "Ah, that changes the matter somewhat." "Why, you don't mean to say, Doctor, that you can't do this!" "Oh; no, by no means, certainly not." "Well, am I not right in saying that he has consented?" "Of course you are, provided I shall be able to make Mr. Wiseman see as I do.' This is the difficulty."' "Oh, if it's there, and I know it is, he'll see it. I tell him and Evangel that you will make it as plain as the noonday sun." "You" know, Miss Delia, that early training and bias have a great deal to do with one's understanding of any subject,'! remarked Dr. Cheney rather tenderly. "Oh, that is so, Doctor, I see it in Herbert every day. He has been brought up a Baptist, and therefore he is one. But he has mind enough, I assure you, to understand any- thing that is placed plainly before him; and I know once you show him the Bible authority for infant baptism, and he will yield at once."   Prognostics.         115 "Not so sure of that, Miss Delia. Mr. Wiseman has a mind of his own, I am led to believe from my personal intercourse with him." "Oh, yes, to be sure he has. Herbert is a very smart man; but then he is also honest and candid, and when he sees Bible authority, he will give right up. He is such a stickler for the Scriptures. He said the other day that he would let no difficulty, however great, prevent him from the discharge of his duty to Vernon. And I tell you, Doctor, all you'll have to do is to show Scripture proof. And that, I know, you can do without any trouble." The Doctor looked quite thoughtful, which Miss Delia not observing, she continued: "And my business here, this afternoon, is to see if you will not come over soon, say next Thursday week, and show him all the places in the Bible, where it is commanded and practiced. If you will do this, he says the baby may be baptized just as soon as we choose. And I do not feel like letting a week pass before it is done, for who knows but that this dear little one may be called suddenly away like the other. Say, Doctor, you will come, can't you, at that time?" The Doctor hesitated to reply. He wished to vindicate the authority of the practice he had followed for twenty- five years, and yet he dared not undertake do so with a Baptist of Mr. Wiseman's intelligence and clear-sighted- ness.  "Why, Doctor, you seem to hesitate. For the honor of the Church, and the salvation of Vernon's soul, you must go. You dare not decline." The Doctor comprehended the situation fully. ' I cannot say just now, Miss Delia, whether I can come at that particular time; but I will come soon. Suppose     "6       Evangel Wiseman. you call to-morrow afternoon, and I shall then doubtless be able to say decisively whether I can attend to this subject on that evening. I am very much pressed with engagements just now. The little boy of Mrs. Pierson's died before I reached there, and I found her in such deep dis- tress, that I deem it my duty to return this afternoon to see if I can console her at all. She is frantic because it was not baptized." "Poor womanI " ejaculated Mrs. Cheney, "how dread- ful that parents should live in such fearful neglect of duty." "It is dreadful, dreadful, Mrs. Cheney. And this is just what I feel in regard to Evangel. She knows what is right. Herbert, owing to his Baptist prejudices, does not; therefore, he is more excusable than she. But I assure you she'll never take a step, however important, without his sanction, and he'll not move an inch unless he is thoroughly convinced. So you see it is imperatively necessary that the Doctor go over and show him the truth." "Well, Miss Delia, I will do so if possible. You call again to-morrow afternoon; by that time I shall be able to see if I can make such disposition of my engagements as to meet your request. Now I am so hurried, that I cannot think; so excuse me." And the Doctor, taking his hat, bowed himself out of the room. The girls were not quite ready to leave. Miss Delia decided to run by home and inform her brother and sister of the encouraging prospect. It was a pleasant little circle around the tea-table that night. Evangel, with that self-control and self-negation that so particularly characterized her, wore a serene and lovely smile. Her husband's presence was always light and joy to her. Miss Delia, so hopeful, was unwontedly cheerful;   Proqnostics.         117 admitted that she might, she believed, like Mr. Carlton, from Herbert's description, even should he be one of the bigoted Baptists. The young ladies were delighted with the information the letter conveyed of Mr. Carlton's speedy arrival, a week or ten days at most. Mr. Wiseman, quite disposed to laugh at aunt Delia for her exposition of Scripture and earnestness to convince him, indulged in a good share of pleasant badinage and piquancy at her expense, all of which she took most amiably, now that there was a certain promise of Vernon's baptism. "Never mind, sir," replied aunt Delia to one of his remarks, that caused all present, even Bridget Mahoney, to laugh immoderately, "'never mind, your style will be greatly changed in a few days. Wait until the Bishop gives you a lesson or two, then we'll see who will do the laughing." "Remember, aunty, the old adage, and do not begin to calculate results before the Bishop has promised to come." "Suppose the Bishop will not consent to come," said Miss Vernon to herself, as she hoisted her parasol at the front gate the following afternoon, now that the fan was in the right pocket and the cuffs properly adjusted, (Miss Delia was one of those nervous temperaments that never felt secure until she had taken a second and third look after her toilet,) as she set out on her pre-arranged call. "It must be done I  I have made up my mind to it, and cannot give it up! But, then, suppose I cannot persuade the Bishop to make up his mind? What then?" and Miss Delia heaved a heavy sigh. She went on soliloquizing as she passed square after square. "What now if he shall object? But how can he? We all have such claims upon him that he will not dare do it.     "8       Evangel Wiseman. Evangel was onoe a member of his church, and, if he can convince Herbert, will be a member again. I know he would be delighted to secure such a prize as Mr. Wise- man. It would be the greatest triumph he has achieved in Chester. But then, it may be he will hesitate to come in direct opposition to Mr. Wiseman's views-would prefer a little stratagem-silent influences rather than open attack. But Herbert is an honest soul--ever open to conviction, (Miss Delia had not thought so the day before, when she was endeavoring to prove infant sprinkling from the Bible), and surely he will feel it his duty to show him the truth. But maybe he will consider it indelicate to come right to his own house expressly for such a purpose. It is Herbert's own arrangement and his own request, and I shall make the Bishop see this, so as to remove any difficulty on this score." After all Miss Delia's pros and cons, the perplexing question was left just where she had set out with it, and her dissatisfaction so increased as she approached the house, that when she reached it and rang the door-bell, she was suffering from an unusual degree of agitation. "Walk in, Miss Delia," said the Doctor, as he discovered his visitor through the open door, walk in and be seated." "Oh, I see you are engaged!" replied Miss Delia apolo- getically, as she accepted the Doctor's invitation and seated herself on the sofa, taking out her fan. The Doctor was in nkgligh, with huge volumes spread out on the table before him, and standing on end on the floor around him. The Doctor marked his page with a slip of paper, and pushing his book a little back, turned squarely round, upsetting by the movement two of his books and jeopardizing his inkstand. Miss Delia looked perturbed-Miss Delia was perturbed.   Prognostics.         119 She fanned vigorously, twitched that left cuff, and pulled at her bonnet strings.           X "You know the object of my visit, Doctor," she said, after everything was to her mind. "Do you think you can go? I do not wish to interrupt you, for I see you are, as usual, quite busy." '6 Oh, no, Miss Delia, not too busy to hear the full state- ment of the facts in the case of Mr. Wiseman. You really shocked me, yesterday, by telling of his readiness to have his baby baptized. I didn't know that anything could lead him to this conclusion. You see I am at work now, study- ing this baptismal controversy -infant baptism especially."- (What an array of books, thought Miss Delia, who began to fear that perhaps after all, it might not be so plainly taught in the Bible.) "I find that two of our prominent members are quite troubled on this subject," continued the Doctor. "One of them, Mrs. Norbrook, you know her quite well, was raised a Campbellite,and she cannot clearly see the need of having her child baptized; and as her husband is not a communicant, she does not propose to have it done. I have endeavored to show her the necessity, but she says she dosen't feel it her duty. The other, Mrs. Minden, who you also know, has had five children baptized. Her husband is one of our prominent vestrymen, but she has been reading some Baptist books, loaned her by her friend, Mrs. Falkland, who is a member of Dr. Eaton's church, and now she will not consent to having her sixth child baptized at all. Says ' there is no need of it, and no authority for it.'  "Why does she not go and join Mrs. Falkland's church, then?"' interposed Miss Delia pettishly, still fanning and twitching the cuff. "This Mrs. Falkland must be a queer woman; they say, Doctor, she is very intelligent and zeal-   120       Evangel Wiseman. ous for her cause. Do ybu know she has a dashing New Orleans belle with her for the summer, Miss Mordaunt, who is a Roman Catholic? But she'll make a Baptist of her no doubt. But what does Mr. Minden say? Surely the Baptist books have not turned his brain?" "Oh, no, he is exceedingly -desirous that it shall be done. And I have, at his suggestion, reasoned with his wife, but she will not be convinced. Indeed, I fear we shall lose her. She has imbibed a great deal of Baptist heterodoxy. She goes to hear Dr. Eaton much more fre- quently than she comes to hear me." "Well, what can she say -as excuse for this strange con- duct?" "Nothing at all but that she is convinced, from search- ing the Bible, that there is no authority for infant baptism, and that in the absence of a divine command, we have no right to administer it." Miss Delia's heart stood still. "Dreadful'! dreadful!"' she exclaimed, untying her bonnet strings, and fanning with unusual vigor, while her face took on an expression of sympathy and horror. "Isn't it too bad, Doctor, too- bad, for church members to do soI I can't, for my life, see how they can take up with those ignorant Baptist notions and prejudices. The uneducated and common people- may believe these things, but how such a woman as Mrs. Minden can have her head turned in this way I can't imagine. People now-a-days are so queer, always running after wild fancies." "It is to be regretted, Miss Delia, that such defections should occur. But I still trust everything may be made right very soon. Mrs. Minden is exceedingly intelligent and pious, and can well comprehend an argument. So I am preparing myself to convince her when I visit her   Xi Prognostics.                     121 again. But I do not know what I shall do with Mrs. Norbrook's case. She will not argue at all; receives all I say pleasantly, and when I am through, simply tells me that she has read the New Testament over five times, and can no where see any infant baptism. My own opinion is, she was led into our Church through Mrs. Minden's influence, for whom she has great admiration. It seems they were classmates, or rather schoolmates, and their families old fiiends, and now that Mrs. Minden will not have her child baptized, neither will she." "Yes, and this is just the way, Doctor. One influences another. 'Evil communications corrupt good manners.' Evangel would never have been made a Baptist, if she had not married a Baptist husband-and so it goes." "Tell me now, Miss Delia, all about Mr. Wiseman's case, so that I may form a correct judgment as to the course to be pursued. You know he is a very well- informed and shrewd man, and it will not do for me to undertake what I may fail in, for men are more willful than the ladies. I think you told me yesterday that Mr. Wiseman had consented, provided I could show   him Bible proof. "Yes, yes, and this is to secure our object entirely, don't you see, Doctor? For you know, the Bible is full of it, only that H don't exactly know where to find it, nor how to present the argument so as to make him under- stand; but you are so thoroughly posted, you will find no trouble, and then we shall have our little baby bap- tized and safe. We have all been so distressed about the other little child, and are determined this one shall not be neglected." "Is the baby sick?" asked the Doctor with evident concern   122       Evangel Wiseman. "Oh, no, it is the heartiest, dearest, sweetest little thing you ever saw. But then you know, it may sicken and die suddenly as Herbert did, and then if it is not baptized-but I will notsay this, for baptized it shall be!" and Miss Delia gave the cuff a doubly emphatic sha- king. "What are Mrs. Wiseman's feelings on this subject?" asked the Bishop, walking thoughtfully back and forth across the room. "Oh, she will do just what her husband says, It does seem to me since she was married she has no opinion of her own. You know, Doctor, what an advocate she used to be for the Church. I do wonder a woman can change so. But I am sure she has her fears about dear little Herbert. She is always so distressed whenever the subject of bap- tism is mentioned, and she listens with great anxiety to all that is said. Oh, I know her mind is so uneasy; but she will not say a word for fear it will not meet with his approbation." "Do you really think Mr. Wiseman is anxious to be informed, or is he desirous for an argument, that he may more thoroughly convince his wife of the right of his position?" Miss Delia must effect her object; so she replied: "He is anxious to be convinced, because we are all so deter- mined it shall be done. He is unwilling to oppose the whole family, if he can only be made to see as we do. But you know, Doctor, Herbert is a very honest man, and will not take a step in anything unless he thinks it is right. Aid he, as much as Evangel, insists that you shall come over next Thursday evening to tea, and explain the whole subject to them, and show them where it is commanded, and all the examples, and what good it does,   Prognostics.         123 and all about it. And I know, Doctor, you can do this, and Herbert once enlightened, the whole thing can be done directly. You will appoint some early day?" "Certainly, certainly, Miss Delia." The Bishop's doubts gave way for the moment under Miss Vernon's positive -?assertions and appeal.   "Yes, yes," said the Doctor, shaking his head with an air of confidence, and resting himself in the easy chair beside the table.  If Mr. Wise- :?  man is so ready to be convinced of the scripturalness of infant baptism, it can easily be done. Let a man's feel- ings and desires take possession of his reason and judg- ment, and the battle is fought; it but remains to declare the victory." All this the Doctor had said to himself. "I will come, Miss Delia, and explain this whole sub- ject. If Mr. Wiseman is anxious for the truth, he can readily be made to understand it; and I think, from what you have told me, he can soon be made to see the neces- sity of baptism for his child. What is the appointed time? I must not make a faux-pas, and spoil the whole matter." "Indeed you musn't, Doctor. Too much depends upon it. Thursday evening of next week is the time,-do remember it; come to early tea, that you may have time to make all the points clear. It does seem to me it s  so hard to make some people understand--they are so ;   obstinate." The Bishop looked at his visitor inquiringly, as he sat patting his feet-a rather undignified, unbishoply pas- time. He knit his brow, turned over the leaves of Hall, scratched his head a little, and thought. "Things don't O j  exactly tally," he said to himself. "What does it mean? Mr. Wiseman 'anxious to be convinced.'  And, 'some people cannot be made to understand, they are so obsti- nate.' How is this?"     124       Evangel Wiseman. "Do you, Miss Delia, really think Mr. Wiseman is anxious to be convinced?"The Doctor laid great stress on the last clause of his interrogatory, while his brow con- tracted more fully and he looked exceedingly doubtful. "Oh yes, yes, Doctor, I know he is. And he has said again and again that he only needs to have it pointed out in the Bible. You know these ignorant Baptists won't have anything in the world but the Bible. Talk to them of what the Church says, and good and great men have taught, and they tell you, 'no, no, they won't listen to this-they must have Bible proof.' The Doctor did not feel re-assured. The subject grew more and more complex. He closed the book, started from his chair and strode the room. 'A grand conquest if it could be made But should failure ensue, what would be the verdict of the community?"This was a point to take into account. "Suppose, Miss Delia, Mr. Wiseman will not see infant baptism in the Bible?" said the Doctor, suddenly turning and confronting her. "What will be done then?" "Oh, we will baptize the baby anyhow. But I tell you, Herbert will see it when you show it to him. He is so quick to perceive anything, and then so candid to admit it. I know you will succeed." "Well, I suppose I must come, Miss Delia. Nothing would delight me more than to make a convert of Mr. Wise- S man. It would add great strength to us, and would be such a triumph for truth. Really I have my hands full of this fearful defection; I must go and see Mrs. Minden, and clear up her doubts; she has been reading so much in these Bap- fist books, that her mind is fearfully confused; she must be brought straight again. The lady is one of our most influ- ential members, you know. '   Prognostics.        125 "Yes, yes, that's so. And I don't see, Doctor, why peo- ple will read these Baptist books. I know they must be dull things-only fit for the narrow-minded that are prejudiced against liberal views. I'm surprised that Mrs. Minden should let such reading turn her head. I always thought she was a sensible woman before. She ought to believe what she has been taught. Certainly the Church knows what is right better than all the Baptist books in the world. I tell you, if I had my way tlere wouldn't be many of them read!"Miss Delia grew so full of indignation that she 'sprang from her seat, and her bonnet-one of the very smallest fry-toppled off. In her endeavor to catch it, the precipitate lunge she made threw her fan in the Doctor's face, and unsettled her chignon, which, in her haste, she had not fastened securely. It was some moments before Miss Delia got "in fix" again. But she was not much non-plussed by this little desagrement. Her proud soul was to much occupied with X   thoughts of those horrid Baptist books. Had she been in Calvin's place, she would have said of Servetus, "I hoped they would condemn him to death, though not the terrible one of being burned ";-and like Calvin, have thought she was doing God service. "I suppose Mrs. Minden wants to find it in the Bible, Doctor, and won't be satisfied with anything else," resumed Miss Delia, as soon as she was sufficiently re-adjusted to proceed with her remarks. "Why doesn't she take what the Church says and go along like a sensible woman. Doesn't she know the Church can teach her better than she can teach herself?" "So I think, Miss Delia, 'and I cannot see why persons should always be finding out new inventions. They cer- tainly should be satisfied with what has been handed down to us from the apostles."     126       Evangel Wiseman. "That's just my opinion, Doctor. But if they won't be satisfied with the authority of the Church, why, let them go searching in the Bible. They'll find enough of it there, for it is full of it." '"Yes, yes, the Church thinks so," responded the Doctor nervously. He knew this was a mooted point. Miss Delia did not know it, and so she proceeded: "Yes, and everybody else thinks so too, but these narrow- -minded Baptists. And they would think so if they would but give up their prejudices." And Miss Delia struck her fan violently against the sofa. "One question before you go, Miss Delia," said the Doc- tor, as that lady, suddenly remembering an errand to the druggist's, arose and hastily stepped to the door, " will the Baptist clergyman, Mr. Eaton, be at Mr. Wiseman's, do you suppose, Miss Delia?"The Doctor affected great non- chalance, but this of all questions he was most eager to have answered decisively. "Oh certainly, certainly, if you wish to see him, Doctor. He is a very pleasant man, they say, and smart too, that is, for a Baptist; but my opinion is, he is quite mediocre. I caught a glimpse of him once; I thought him passable, nothing more." "I have heard he is very intelligent," interposed the Doctor, interrogatively. "Oh, yes, so they say; Herbert thinks he is, but then you know, that is because he is a Baptist. I have no idea he is half the man they say he is. Indeed we know he can't be. But if you wish to meet him, Doctor, I know that Herbert will be more than delighted to have him come." "Oh, I scarcely think this necessary," replied the Doctor, coolly. "I can makze his acquaintance some other time, per- haps just as well; let this be a family affair."   Prognostics.         127 "' Just as you like, Doctor. You'll be sure to come-come early. You know you'll need a great deal of time to explain everything fully, and we must make sure work of it this time."' And Miss Delia dashed off to Dr. Hodge's drug store for the medicine, a much happier woman than when she came to the Bishop's. All the way she was picturing to herself the beautiful baptismal scene so soon to take place. (  , "Well, well," said. the rector aloud, as he seated himself at his table on which lay his voluminous authors, and leaned his head thoughtfully on his hand, "this is a strange state of affairs. Where will it end? Mrs. Wiseman already a Bap- tist; two more of our influential members disturbed about infant baptism, and this discussion with Mr. Wiseman worst !  of all. What shall I do to prevent a stir in the community? Everything must be surely and quietly managed. Could get l   on very well with Mrs. Minden and Mrs. Gregory, but I fear the result of the discussion with Mr. Wiseman. Such a large circle to be influenced by it I Miss Delia thinks he is anxious to be convinced, but surely she is mistaken. Why should he wish to be, now his wife has joined the Baptists with him? I see no reason for it, and fear it is only her eager desire to have it done, that leads her to this conclu- sion. I am dubious as to results," and the Doctor shook his I  head unconsciously. "Mr. Wiseman is intelligent, well posted, and will be hard to move; but I must do my best. If he wishes to be convinced, the thing is easy; but then, if he does not, -why-well, it will be difficult-impossible! So much reasoning! For the Bible is not half as plain on this point as Miss Delia thinks. If I fail-'twould be better not to undertake--but-I can't recede now-too much at stake-I must prepare for the conflict. Let me see-first, I must know all my opponent's grounds." The Doctor sprang from his chair and took a careful A     128       Evangel Wiseman. search through his library for such works as would aid him in obtaining the best Baptist arguments. But he could find nothing that satisfied him, so he whisked off his slippers and quickly drew on his boots, laid. aside his dressing-gown for his coat, and hastened down street to Triggs $& Merrill's book-store, to purchase Carson on Baptism, and fortunately for him he succeeded in :finding Gale's Reflections on Wall's History of Infant Baptism. "Yes, yes, this is the very book you will need, Bishop," said Mr. Trimble, the clerk, as he handed it to him. "It contains all you want, I think." "Thank you, thank you, Mr. Trimble," replied the Bishop, taking the book and bowing very politely. "I wish to get the strongest arguments you Baptists can produce. I want to refute them, you know, that you may be led into the truth." "The strongest argument that we Baptists produce on this subject, Bishop, is that it is nowhere commanded or set forth in the Bible." "Oh yes, yes, I'm aware that is your opinion, Mr. Trim- ble, but then you know there is great difference on this very point," and the Doctor smiled very complacently. Mr. Trimble, the clerk, was equally as complacent as the Bishop, when he said: "But, Bishop, if it is there, there can be no mistake about it. It is either in the Bible, or it is not. If there, it can and should be found, and now I -say to you if you will show me one instance where it is commanded by the Saviour, or practiced by the apostles, I will have all my babies sprinkled just when you say so," and Mr. Trimble reached to the shelf behind him and handed the Bishop a Bible. "Oh, no time for discussion now, Mr. Trimble. That is the challenge you Baptists always offer, and then when it is   PrognosticS.         129 pointed out to you, you say, "Oh, infant baptism is not mentioned there. You know the old adage, none so blind as those who will not see.' But, good evening, good even- ing, Mr. Trimble, I am very busy to-day. Another time we will talk on this subject. Good evening I "And the Bishop A.! hastily bowed himself out, glad thus to escape the showing of the one instance. Equipped with a full array of authors, the Bishop returned ,! to his study and entered on the investigation. His heart was heavy, for he felt as so many others have done, that "Bible proof" is hard to produce. Some of the results of the night's searching after truth we shall see in the results of that pro- posed discussion--others will never be known until all things are revealed in the day of grand account. Had he acted on the principle of the little Sunday-school sonIg, "Dare to do right, dare to be true," Bishop Cheney would have sprinkled no more babies. Of.     130   -   Evangel Wiseman. CHAPTER VIII. SIDE CHATS. "No fairy o'er the spangled lawn More gaily tripped than she." ( ( TUST see what can be done by a little pluck and per- severance," said Miss Delia to Mr. and Mrs. Vernon and Lilly, as, hastening up the gravel walk from the front gate, she tossed her bonnet aside and seated herself on the verandah steps to rest and fan. "I had made up my mind to it, and now you see it is as well as done." What, aunty, what? do tell us," said Lilly, springing from her chair; and throwing aside her pretty red and white tidy she was crocheting, she seated herself beside Miss Ver- non on the step, and looked up into her face with a trustful, earnest expression, while the color came and went. Lilly knew of what her aunty was speaking. Why, the baby baptized." "What, sister," exclaimed Mr. Vernon, laying aside his newspaper and folding up his spectacles, this latter act bespeaking his interest in the ladies' conversation, "you don't mean Evangels baby is baptized?" "Not exactly baptized, but just as good a's baptized;" and Miss Delia proceeded to relate; in the most animated manner and tone, the result of her conversation with Mr. Wiseman, and the success of her call on the Bishop. "Oh, Delia, let me give a word of warning," interposed Mrs. Vernon. "You know the old adage, 'There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.'"   Side Chats.         131 "But I don't see, sister, what possible slip there can be in this case. We all know Herbert is truthful and honest, if he is a Baptist. And he told me again and again if I would show him Bible proof for infant baptism, Vernon should be baptized forthwith. I couldn't exacly do it, but Dr. Cheney can, and will, and that next Thursday evening. And Lilly, you must go up town to-morrow and see the robes and caps at Madame Dudefand's, so that we can decide what will be best for him to wear. And sister, you and brother and Lilly must go over to hear what Doctor Cheney says;,so that you may ever after be fully posted on this important subject." "Do you, Delia," said Mr. Vernon, gravely, "suppose that Herbert can see any infant baptism in the Bible now, when he has so long failed to do so?" "Why, certainly he will, brother.  The Bishop will show it to him so clearly he will be obliged to see it. He has always had the argument all his own way with Evangel, but this time there will be two sides to the question. I would have answered him   myself but he wouldn't listen to me. Wouldn't see a single thing, but denied all I said. It is just as clear to me as that beau- tiful sun yonder, and I tried to make him see it, but la  he wouldn't see anything, and I just had to hand him over to the Doctor, because he was so willful." ' "Ah, aunty, may be brother won't see now." a:i  "But I tell you, Lilly Vernon, he'll have to see, for Bishop Cheney will make the matter so plain he can't help it, if he is so blinded by prejudice and these old fashioned Baptist notions of his. "But what do you think, sister," she said, addressing Mrs. Vernon, who sat running tapes into baby's gown; "Mrs. Minden, our friend Mrs. Col. Minden, and Mrs.     132       Evangel Wiseman. Gregory, are both turning Baptist, too, the Doctor tells me. Now, its not surprising' to me that Mrs. Gregory should get such tom-foolery into her head, for she was raised a Campbellite, the Bishop said. But just think of Mrs. Minden--Mrs. Minden, one of our most influential members, and wife of our chief vestryman I Isn't it too bad?" "Why, what can be influencing her, Delia?" asked Mrs. Vernon, deeply interested. Mrs. Minden was a dear friend of the family. "Oh, she has been reading some of their Baptist books, and like the others she fancies now that infant baptism isn't taught in the Bible, and if it isn't there it should not be practiced. I think it's a great, pity people don't read their own books and let other folks' books alone. No one could catch me running round hunting up all sorts of old fashioned notions to trouble myself with." "Ah, but Delia, wouldn't you like to know what others think and their reasons for thinking so. You know there are two sides to all controversies, and perhaps if you fully understood the Baptist phase of this subject you would find that possibly they had some reason for their side, as well as prejudice." "No, brother, what do I want to know the other side for, when I'm sure I'm on the right side. I have no idea of filling up my head with other people's silly notions. But really I must go over to Evangel's, and let them know Dr. Cheney's intention. I am sure she will be glad, for i I tell you, as I have often done before, she is not satisfied about Herbert's dying unbaptized," and Miss Delia rose to leave. a' May I go with you, aunty? I am so anxious to hear what brother will say about this whole matter. Just a moment, while I run up and get my hat."   OR Side Chats.            133 I    ( CLilly, Lilly, illy," called out Miss Delia, bring down that book from the work table, please." I   In a few minutes she appeared, and the two set out for Mr. Wiseman's, book in hand. They had not proceeded far before they met Afnie Chiles and Fannie Cheney, :??1, who were going to see if Lilly would be one of the pic- ,:Mi  nic party. The girls made arrangements, discussed and XIII  decided upon costume for the occasion, etc., etc. "But Miss Delia, what great book is that you have, please tell me, a book of receipts for babies regime, I suppose?" "I Oh, it's my Bible, Annie. I'm going to look out the places where children were baptized. I have done this once since Herbert was born, but I forgot where they were, yesterday, when I came to tell Herbert about them, Now, I am going to set them down on paper and keep them in my pocket, and then I'll be ready for him, sure. Fannie, don't let your father forget his promise to come to Her- bert's next Thursday night. What do you think, girls, our baby, at last, is as good as baptized."  "Why, Miss Delia!" exclaimed both girls at once. "How you surprise us. We never thought Mr. Wise- man would consw t this. What has so suddenly changed his mind?" "He says if it can be found in the Bible, Vqrnon shall be baptized right away, and you know the Bible is full of it. And your father, Fannie, is coming over next Thursday to show it to him, babies, names and all. So, girls, you must go to work and see that he is prepared. I think you -three can make a robe as beautiful as any you can buy, and you must do it, right away.  Lilly will go up town, to-morrow, to see about it." "Yes, indeed, Miss Delia; we will gladly assist you in whatever way we can, -rely on us."     134       Evangel Wiseman. C"But aunty," suggested Lilly, "had we not better wait until brother is convinced? We may have our trouble for nothing." "Lilly Vernon, child, can't you understand a plain 'prop- osition? Herbert, I just told yoif that, Herbert will have Vernon baptized as soon as he is convinced there is Bible authority for it. And isn't the Bible full of it from first to last, and isn't Dr. Cheney coming to show it to him? What assurance do you ask?"Miss Delia spoke as emphat- ically as a logician. Lilly laughingly answered, "But suppose brother will not be convinced?" "( But he will, Lilly Vernon; rest assured of that." Miss Delia was as imperious as a Czar. So it was agreed that the three girls should meet the following morning at Madame Dudefand's to select mate- rials for Vernon's baptismal robe. The-;babe was sweetly sleeping. "Good as could be all the while, aunty. Look here, see how much I have done since you left;" and the loving mother held up the dainty little white muslin gown, on which she had been stitching, to attest the truth of her testimony in behalf of her boy. On the beautiful inlaid table, res ting beside her work box, lay Evangel's Bible. In Miss Delia's absence she had been studying the words of Christ as quoted by-Miss Vernon. She had found no infant baptism in them. If there, she could not discover it. Perplexed, she had asked herself a dozen times: "Is it possible that God's word teaches this? If so, where? And if npt so, why should men practice it as of divine authority?"She was almost despairing in her bewilderment. When the mind is in doubt,- how often will the questions to be answered, recur I /   I  Side Chlats.       135 It may assume protean forms, but it is always the same hideous spectre. Through all the weary months since Herbert's death, had these two distracting queries chased each other through her throbbing brain: "If infant bap- :;   tism is taulght in God's word, where is it? And if not A 1    found, there; why have good and wise men advocated and X'  -practiced it through so many ages?" And thus from day to day this fearful inner strife went on, unknown to all save herself and God. At times it had become almost intolerable. In her anguish she would cry out: "Oh, Lord, help me, for I am weakl! 1 know not where to look!"  She felt Herbert's destiny was fixed. "This, O  Father, whatever it may be, I must now submit to!" she would exclaim repeatedly to herself, while her soul would sink within her at the thought of neglected duty. After Vernon was given her, she realized the responsi- bility of his case must be met and righteously discharged. Nothing could exculpate any departure from the right in answering the demands of this child's eternal interests. But what was duty-what was the right! Who would guide her through this bewildering maze to certainty and truth? Could there be conceived a more fearfully distracting condition for a loving, conscientious mother's soul? And this was the state of unrest in wlich Evangel's mind constantly revolved. Aunt Delia's face was radiantly bright. Evangel read "success " in its expression, as the doating aunt tip-toeingly approached the cradle and, throwing aside the snowy net, gazed so tenderly into the chubby innocent face of the little sleeper. Bending over she kissed him daintily lest he should awake. Then replacing the spread and net with the greatest care, she turned to Evangel and said:     136       Evangel Wiseman. It's all right I  That precious darling will be baptized- apd that soon. Dr. Cheney will come over on Thursday evening and show Herbert to his heart's content, that infant baptism is in the Bible, and I know when he is convinced you will be too." Having made this prophetic announcement, Miss Delia placed her book on the table, threw her bonnet on the bed, re-adjusted before the mirror her chignon, which was still awry from the fatal disarrangement in the Doctor's study, drew up a, large arm easy-chair,and 'placing her feet very squarely on the, back of the Maltese cat, which her own fingers had fashioned on the ottoman, took out'her fan, and with a few passes, cooling herself sufficiently, she began her recital of all that had occurred at the Bishop's, not neglecting the cases of Mrs. Minden and Mrs. Gregory, on both of which she expatiated eloquently. "Now, Evangel!" she asked, as she lifted Vernon-whom her excited manner of talking had aroused--from the cradle, "don't you feel certain this baby will be baptized soon?" And she kissed him again and again, repeating "Poor little one, you shan't be neglected." "The strangest thing to me, Evangel," she added, as she smoothed down the muslin gown and drew -back the little buff sack, "is brother's doubt about Herbert. He will not believe. When I told him he shook his head, as much as to say, don't be too hopeful. The matter is not settled yet, and your mother, the more to discourage, quoted that old saw, 'Many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.' But the girls, bless their souls, are going to begin right away to make the new robe for the occasion. Ain't you, Lilly?" and Miss Delia bowed to the beautiful girl, who just then entered the room with a bouquet of fresh flowers, which she placed-in the Parian vase on the work-stand,    Side Chats.         137 "I fear myself you are too sanguine, aunty. Herbert is a great Bible reader, and it seems to me he knows all that's in it. And he finds no authority for baptizing children, and no example of its practice." "Why, Evangel, how can you talk sol" and Miss Vernon bent a look of stern reproof on her-opponent, while she fanned so violently as almost to take the baby's breath. "Why, don't you know, child, the New Testament is full of it?" Evangel replied pleasantly yet firmly: "Indeed, I do not, aunty. On the contrary I can't find it anywhere. I have been looking for it since you left. I have read and re-read the words of our Saviourfyou quoted yesterday, and there is no mention of it there.!"- "Why don't you say ' Mr. Wiseman says so^?" inter- rupted Miss Vernon nervously. "With Cruden's Concordance I have looked out all ' the places in the Testament where baptism is mentioned, and I can see nothing at all that leads me to infer that Christ enjoined, or His apostles practiced this rite. And the only thing that prevents my discarding the whole subject as unscriptural, is its advocacy by so many good men in all ages. If I could understand why this is so, and yet it not taught in the Scriptures, my mind would be forever at rest. But the only reason that I can compre- hend for its observance is, that the Bible teaches it some where, although I cannot find it." "Yes, yes, Evangel, you are right-the Bible if full of it I have seen innumerable instances myself." "I do wish you would show them to me, aunty? I have never been able to find even one in all my searchings!" replied Mrs. Wiseman, quietly sewing away on the little muslin gown, her face sweetly calm in its look, though the heightened color told of emotion.     138       Evangel Wiseman. "Why, child, where are all those instances of house- holds? Lydia's babies, and the jailor's babies, and that other family- I forgot the name just now-- Stephen's and all those other families, too, many to be mentioned? It is too bad that you Baptists will be so blind "I "I have looked each one of these statements over care- fully this afternoon, in your absence, and I see no mention of children or babies at all--no allusion to them, aunty." "But you know there must have been babies in each one of these families!" and aunty's choler sprung up again. "Indeed, I don't know  this at all, aunty," replied Evangel, calmly.  "Why, Evangel, I'd like to know how there could be a family without a baby in it?t'  "Have you a baby at father's, aunt Delia?" asked Mrs. Wiseman, naively. Lilly could not refrain from laughing at her aunty's dilemma. "Oh, pshaw! It's no use talking to you, Evangel," and aunt Delia whisked out of her chair to place the baby in the cradle. 'You are just like Herbert-you won't be con- vinced. One may argue, and argue, and argue, and show you the truth-hush, darling, go to sleep," interlarded Miss Delia, patting the baby gently-" and you can't or won't understand, and that, too, when it is made as clear as the sun at mid-day. But I shan't bother with you and Herbert anymore. I hand you over to Dr. Cheney--he will straighten you both in a little while, and get out of your minds all of those old-fashioned Baptist notions. Here, Lilly, look after Vernon while I'm down stairs and see after Bridget. Herbert will be in directly, and will want his tea." And Miss Delia swept out of the room-quite indignant at her niece's failure to appreciate her argument-down the stair-way to the kitchen, where she found Bridget Mahoney busy with her supper and singing an Irish ditty.   Side Chats.         139  "Well, aunty," asked Mr. Wiseman, as the happy little family sat around the tea-table sipping their tea, and par- taking bountifully of Bridget Mahoney's rolls, which she declared were as light as the "' say foum," " did you go to see the Bishop this afternoon, and did he promise to come promptly on Thursday evening next, to enlighten us igno- rant Baptists on the all-important subject of baby sprink- ling? ' "Why, Mr. Wiseman!" exclaimed Miss Vernon, letting * fall her knife and fork suddenly, and holding up her hands in mortal horror at the impiety of her friend's question. "How can you speak of this holy and scriptural ordinance in that irreverent manner; how can you(?" "How holy and scriptural, aunt Delia," he replied, quite disposed to enjoy Miss Vernon's nervous consternation. "Why, just as holy and scriptural as the Church's author- ity in all ages can make it." "And that is not onle whit holy, or scriptural, either. Neither your church nor any other has any such power. Miss Vernon was quite overcome. For a moment she could not reply. She sat as one terrified. No one spoke. Bridget Mahoney stood looking on with wonder, her little pale blue eyes seeking the face of first one and then the other, in vain endeavor to ascertain the full meaning of the situation. "What do you mean, Herbert?" asked Miss Delia in her most excited manner, as soon as she could find breath to speak. "No wonder you Baptists have always been so few and ignorant, if these are your views. It does seem impious to me that you dare talk so. What do you mean by it?" "Just this plain common-sense proposition, aunt Delia, "that no church, nor number of churches, no presbytery nor synod, no conference nor council, no convention nor     "O       Evangel Wiseman. decree of men, could ever make anything either scriptural or holy." "Why, Herbert, isn't baptism a holy sacrament?" "If it is, the authority of' the Church,' as you designate it, never made it so. And you, yourself, must see the folly of calling anything enacted by men, scriptural." Miss Delia was non-plussed. She had no taste for tech- nicalities, only so far as she had learned them from her prayer-book; and metaphysics she left to " older and wiser heads." So she sat in silent disdain, sipping her tea, seem-- ingly unconscious of, the presence of those around her. Her "' sang-froid" was most amusing, yet no one dared to smile. The silence was becoming embarrassing. "Pardon this little unlooked-for digression, aunty ," remarked Mr. Wiseman, pleasantly, desirous to heal the breach, "and tell us, will the Bishop come over next Thursday, to tea?"    , Bridget, perceiving things were re-instated, took her arms from their akimbo position, and darted off to the kitchen to replenish the plate with her light " say foum" rolls, at the same time muttering to herself 9i Ave Maria, which she concluded with these words, as she placed the rolls on the plate: "Well, these Baptists is the most peculiariest paple in all the whole warld-such dreadful heratycs! But I must kape low till my time comes." "Yes, Bishop Cheney will come, and come prepared to convince you, too. So you had just as well make up your mind to your duty now. Then you won't speak of this-" holy ordinance, aunty was about to say, but she checked herself-" this infant baptism disrespectfully as you do now." "Did you tell the Doctor, aunty, that I am an incorrigi- ble, naoow-minded, prejudiced Baptist-one of the old- y   -  .      Side Chats.         141 fashioned, bigoted ones, believing in immersion as the only mode of baptism, and believers as the only subjects, and that terrible bug-bear-close communion?" "No, Herbert, I didn't tell him a word of such stuff. He knew all that well enough without my telling him. I told him just the plain simple truth in the case-that you feel now you. can't find any authority in the Bible for infant baptism, but just as sooh as he will come and show it to you) you will have the baby baptized." "Did he promise he would show it to me and make me see it?" "Certainly he did. And he will, too, I assure you. Then we'll see what you'll do." "What I will do! Why just what I have told you- have the baby baptized. And we now suppose, aunty, the whole matter is settled? The Bishop will show it to me. Seeing, I must believe. How nicely the whole thing fits in. All that is wanting now is the robe and the appointment of the occasion. Evangel, dear, you will get the dress ready, won't you? Bishop Cheney will name the time, and then see how nicely the matter will be conducted." "Aunty tells me that Annie and Lilly have the robe in charge, and are going up town to-morrow to make purchase of material." "Oh, yes, Evangel needn't give herself any trouble on that score. The girls are but too happy to attend to it. -And it shall be magnificent, brother, I can tell you. We are determined to have a finer display than Mrs. Major Allen did. You remember, Evangel, what a furore the baptism of her child created among the mothers of the church? But our baby shall outvie all who have gone before it." "The matter progresses finely. Really I had no idea it was so far advanced! What do you say to it, d ling?"     "2       Evangel Wiseman. "'All's well that ends well,' you know, Herbert," fesponded the wife, evading a direct reply. "But before I pass my opinion I must hear what Dr. Cheney has to say. I may not, you know, see as clearly as aunty does; you will, though she frequently intimates that I look only through your spectacles." "I have no fears of her, Mr. Wiseman. Only get you straight, and all will end well. Evangel was brought up with proper views on the subject, though of late she seems to be a little hazy; but if you are converted to the right, I will guarantee Evangel will not stand in the way." But, aunty, suppose for a moment Herbert cannot see as Dr. Cheney would have him do, what then? I think your preparations are perhaps premature." "Evangel, why do you talk so? It is certainly taught in the Bible, and when Dr. Cheney shows it to Herbert, can't he fully understand it, if he will? He can be made to see it, and I know he is honest enough to admit it." "Mr. Wiseman smiled at Miss Delia's dispatch in setting aside his life-long convictions. "But, aunty, what shall we do if brother cannot be con- vinced?" asked Lilly, looking quite beyond the point under advisement. "Why, I'll baptize Vernon myself! That's all. He shall not suffer through my neglect!" ' Mr. Wiseman!" said aunt Delia, turning upon him an ireful look, "you are really the most incorrigible man I ever saw in my life! I do believe you have made up your mind not to be convinced-no, not even if Dr. Cheney should read you the name, and the time, and the place, where the children spoken of in the Bible were baptized!" Mr. Wiseman could refrain no longer, so he gave way to a  dod hearty laugh, in which he was joined by his , ff   Side Chats.         143 wife, who, for some time, with great difficulty, suppressed her risibles. Lilly remained quite posee-she was on aunty's side. Miss Delia's earnestness was fearfully shocked. She looked up in blank surprise, as she added: "Indeed, Herbert and Evangel, you needn't laugh. You both know that every word I say is true. Herbert is perverse. Didn't I tell you, Evangel, just before supper, of all those household baptisms, even called them by name, J  and you did just as Herbert will do when Dr. Cheney shows them to him-turn away and say, 'why, there are no infants mentioned there.'"Miss Delia sipped her second cup of tea most energetically, bearing as well as she could the perverseness of the obstinate, misguided pair. "Herbert, what do you suppose Evangel answered me this evening, when I named over all those household baptisms, and showed her there must have been children in them?"' "Indeed, aunty, I can't imagine. She has read those things for herself, and has her own views-not mine- remember. What did she say?" "Why, she asked me if there couldn't be households without children, saying we had none at father's--just as if every household spoken of in the Scriptures had to be like ours. Did you ever hear of such willfulness?" "Why, Evangel argues pretty well, doesn't she, aunty?" replied Mr. Wiseman, endeavoring by his conciliating tones to pacify Miss Vernon, who had grown excited, very. "Indeed she doesn't. She doesn't argue at all. She only shuts her eyes and asserts. Won't see anything, and when you prove anything to her, she turns round and asks silly questions. For my part, I shall say nothing more to either of you on this subject. If Bishop Cheney     "4      .Evangel Wiseman. can't remove your prejudices and silence your foolish questions about households, why, I'll take matters into my own hands and do my duty. I am not going to be disappointed in this, rest assured!"And Miss Vernon, taking the remainder of her tea at one draught, ran off up-stairs without awaiting a reply.   .                        .   Dinner-table Talk-Rev. Mr. Earle.     145 CHAPTER IX. DINNER-TABLE TALK-REV. MR. EARLE. ISS Delia had issued her ukase. Her friends knew it meant perseverance to the death. She was plan- ning and plotting, arranging and managing, here, there, and everywhere, for the grand consummation, which i  she intended should take place before the die of-circum- stances should forever preclude the possibility of success. Mr. Wiseman had long been desirous that Mr. and Mrs;. Vernon should personally become acquainted with his pastor, Rev. Mr. Eaton. He knew their views of Baptist ministers, their strong attachment to the forms of their , own church, their sadness and misgivings regarding little v Herbert, and their grief and chagrin at the change of their daughter's church relation; and he felt for them to know more of Baptists and their faith and practice, would do much toward softening their asperities and enlightening their understandings. So he requested his wife to invite her family, and that of Dr. Eaton, to dine together with them, before the Bishop should make his onslaught. Dr. and Mrs. Eaton were persons of the highest culture. She was the daughter of wealthy Soluthern parents, who had judiciously expended their means to fit her for life. She had graduated' in Philadelphia with honor, highly accomplished with all the advantages of travel and society. She had been sought by the wealthiest gentlemen of the land. But she loved the Lord Jesus and His truth, and rejecting her many suitors she had given the wealth of love of her pure, generous soul to Mr. Eaton, a graduate 9     "6       Evangel Wiseman. of Yale, and became the wife of a country pastor. The trials and privations she had shared with the husband of her choice, only served to deepen and strengthen their mutual love and trust, while each day they together grew in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. Children were given them of the Lord, whom they faithfully trained for Him. And in all Chester, there was not a more intelli- gent, energetic, attractive young lady than Fannie, their eldest, a girl of eighteen. At the table, the conversation turned upon the proposed meeting to be held in two weeks, conducted by the Rev. Mr. Earle, of Newton, Massachusetts, the successful revival- ist, whose labors for the building up of our dear Redeemer's kingdom have everywhere been signally owned and blest of Him whose promise is "I am with you always." "Tell us, Dr. Eaton, if you please," said Mr. Vernon, addressing himself to this gentleman, who sat opposite him, and for whom he had already felt a deep respect mingled with some degree of admiration, "tell us, if you please, what is the peculiar charm of this Rev. Mr. Earle, who is so soon to be in our midst. For the last two or three days I have heard his name mentioned wherever I am. Only this morning I heard a gentleman on the street-car observe that he regarded him as the greatest preacher living. The speaker was not a professor of religion at all, but by curiosity had been led to attend a series of meetings in New Orleans, con- ducted by this revivalist." He is, doubtless, sir, a wonderful man,' was the Doc- tor's reply, "and in answer to your question, I will state what a brother minister once remarked in my hearing. This brother, a resident of Northern Virginia, left his home  and traveled to Rockwood, to ascertain for himself, if h6 could ascertain, wherein Mr. Earle's great power consisted.   Dinner-table Talk-Rev. Mr. Earle.     147 On being asked by a brother minister and his wife what it was in the man that gave him such unlimited influence over the minds of his vast audience, he answered, ' I cannot, my brother, tell you what he is, but I can tell you what he is ,not. He is not learnedly logical, nor enthusiastically elo- quent, nor sickly rhetorical, nor elaborately exegetical, nor especially earnest, nor particularly persuasive, nor fervidly feeling, nor conveniently emotional, and yet he is the most remarkable man, taking him all in all, that I have ever seen, and sways his large audience most perfectly.' "And what, Doctor, do you think is his power?" "I believe it to lie, Mr. Vernon, in his calm faith, clear    understanding of the word of God, his simple and earnest presentation of it, and his thorough appreciation of the wants of the human soul; all those blessed by the accom- panying influence of the Holy Spirit. He believes, and therefore he speaks. And relying with implicit confidence on the promise and the power of the Holy Spirit, he does what he is persuaded is his duty, and looks for the blessing according to the promise." "What do you think, Doctor, of his view of the 'rest of faith? ' asked Mr. Wiseman. "I think, sir, it is entirely consistent with the teachings of the Holy Spirit through the apostle Paul. He believes 'there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus,' and not only believing, but by faith realizing it 'he rejoices always in the Lord.'  "And do you think, Doctor, this state of mind, or degree of faith, is attainable by all Christians?" "Mr. Earle thus thinks and teaches, and I do not know twhy it is not. The promises are to all who are in Christ Jesus. And if we live as near to Him as it is our blessed privilege to do, and would trust His promises as it is our     Evangel WTiseman.                    Dinj duty to do, I cannot understand why we may not 'always rejoice.' I suppose you have read his work,' Bringing in Sheaves.' You know in that he shows how he struggled on for years seeking this high spiritual condition, sometimes, as he supposed, mounting upward, then again sinking lower, and thus feeling he was making no progress, and all the while painfully conscious that he had not yet attained that perfect assurance which he so coveted, until, as he tells use in answer to prayer this long-sought boon was bestowed on him, since which time he has not had a doubt or fear." "This is the doctrine held by the Methodists, I believe, Doctor-the doctrine of sanctification." "Their view is, that the Christian becomes sanctified- that is, does not commit sin. Mr. Earle's is, that while no man liveth and sinneth not, 'yet with the declarations of God's word before us we can, by faith, realize that the penalty of sin is removed, and that while we are conscious that we are sinful, and that we sin, we also realize that there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ by a living faith." "Is this the generally received belief of your church, Dr. Eaton?" asked Mr. Vernon, surprised at the statement just made. "Our denomination, sir, as a people, have never discussed that point. Some believe it, some do not. It has never been brought before any religious sect as a matter of con- troversy that I am aware of." " You say, Dr. Eaton," interposed Mrs. Vernon, not fully comprehending his former explanation, "that this view of Dr. Earle is not what the Methodists denominate sanctifica- tion?" " No, madam, not at all. It is not a state of sinlessness. Mr. Earle claims no such perfection. It is, as he terms it,   'The rest of faith.' His view, I believe, is this-that while in the flesh he is necessarily imperfect-is a sinner-but a sinner in a saved state, not yet to be saved, but already redeemed from the curse of the law by the blood of Christ which atoned for him, and having by faith accepted the sal- vation which Christ has brought about for him, and taking what the New Testament teaches on this point, he has dedi- cated all he has-his time, money, talents, body, wife, children, all he is, and all he possesses, unreservedly, to the Master. And he believes the offering has, for Christ's sake, been accepted, all unworthy as it is in itself." "What a sublime faith, and what a happy condition," said Mrs. Wiseman, with deep emotion. "Oh, that I could feel thus! And did you observe, Dr. Eaton, that Mr. Earle thinks all Christians can attain to this degree of faith?" " He does. But he regards perseverance according to the word of God, as necessary to its attainment. ' Seek and ye shall find.'" " And do you believe so, Doctor?" she asked, earnestly. " I do, Mrs. Wiseman, most assuredly. I have always felt that Christians live far beneath their exalted privilege in this, as in many other respects. I would scarcely dare deny this doctrine with the Bible in my hand. There are so many. passages clearly indicating it." It was a most interesting subject, one entirely new to all present, save the family of Dr. Eatoii. As it was a Baptist view, Miss Delia took but little interest in its discussion. Had the church spoken, she would not only have heeded but accepted. "And how do you think, Doctors this glorious state may be attained?" asked Evangel, her whole manner evincing deep personal interest. I must answer you, Mrs. Wiseman, in the words of    150       Evangel Wiseman. Mr. Earle: ' By giving up all into the hands of CBrist-- keeping nohing back, and then taking His promises and believing them.' The answer may not come this week perhaps, or this year; but let not the earnest Christian seeker despair. The Lord will answer in good time. Our faith must be like that of Abraham, believing, trusting against positive command: 'My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt-offering."           'k Evangel grew thoughtful. Could this perfect peace be attained? Could she attain it? If so, why should she not set aside all for this? Then her mind would be free from  the distracting doubts that so often well-nigh drove her to despair.                          ; "He is very popular, I believe. All classes of people and all sects go to hear him. I presume he will attract large crowds here. His fame has fully preceded him." "Yes, he is beloved and respected by all. And generally wherever he holds a meeting the house is thronged. Often- times it becomes necessary to remove from the church to the :' largest audience room in the city. I trust it may be so here. : I hope, Mr. Vernon, you and Mrs. Vernon, and Miss e Vernon. and Miss Lilly, will come out during our meetings and judge of him for yourselves." "We will, Doctor, certainly," replied Mrs. Vernon. Mr. V. bowed assent. Miss Delia said not a word, but she resolved a whole lot of negatives. "There was one remark made by this gentleman in the car this morning, that struck me. It was that Mr. Earlb  joins with other denominations-preaches in their churches --and has their preachers to sit with him in his pulpit. Is ! he not a strange kind of Baptist, as well as a most remark- i able man, Doctor?" "Oh, no, Mr. Vernon. This is not strange for a Baptist I - '       Si -    Dinner-table Talk-Rev. Mr. Earle.      151 You are aware, I suppose, that we are not ' High Church' like our friends, the Episcopalians. Other denominations preach in our pulpits, and we in theirs. Mr. Earle is a true Baptist, unflincthing in his denominational views, and never hesitates to declare them openly when he thinks it proper to do so-he always regards his meetings as Baptist meet- ings, whether held in a Baptist church-house or any other, in a public hall, opera house, or beneath a tree. He is very liberal in Christian love, yet very tenacious of our distin- guishing tenets, as he holds that Baptists believe, and prac- tice, as Christ Himself taught." "This seems liberal, Doctor, and at the same time con- sistent." "I think our meeting, will attract the attention of the community, and I do trust it will result in great good, Doctor," remarked Mr. Wiseman. "I think so, sir. His labors have been blessed where- ever he has gone. And it appears to me that Chester needs the work of the Spirit in her midst as much as any place could. Besides, the longing, earnest desire of many of our' brethren and sisters betokens good." "You may be satisfied, gentlemen, that the meeting will attract great attention. It is already the theme of conversation wherever I go,"  remarked  Mr. Vernon. "And I hope, gentlemen, the services will be what you anticipate." The' afternoon passed most agreeably to all present. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon found Dr. Eaton's family one of the most pleasant, and intelligent, they had met in a great while, and the Doctor's great fund of general informa- tion, united to the amenity and grace of his manner, so attracted and fixed the attention of the visitors that they quite forgot all differences of religious belief, and kept e      152       Evangel Wiseman. in entire abeyance former prejudices and dislikes. utuzus consensus made them friends. The young ladies, Fannie and Lilly, were charmed with each others' acquaintance. They discussed various topics, the pic-nic of the following day,--in a word the usual loci communes, and with that beautiful characteristic of trust where fancy is pleased, parted friends not of a day but of a lifetime. Miss Delia was the only unhappy one, of all that cheer- ful company. Her soul was filled with fever and indig- nation. She was restless, unhappy. She took a solo walk  amid the flowers, but their. beauty and perfume could not chase away the evil spirit within. She sought the baby and nursed him awhile, but this employment was     the prolific source of hydra-headed doubts. She tried a   A piece of wool embroidery, but somehow the count of can- : vass would not come out right, and she had to pull out   i as fast as she put in. Tossing this into her work basket, X she turned her attention to the " nany household bap-   ; tisms" which she had enumerated to Evangel, but they,    :? too, were out of joint, - not half the moiety of the babies which she had always seen, and after having read and re-read again the baptism of Lydia and' her household, she closed the Bible and soliloquized thus, as she rested her head on her hand, and her elbow on the table, while her right toe tipped the cradle-rocker: "If this dreadful  A Mr. Earle shahl get here to turn Chester upside down    - before this baby is baptized, I shall never get it decently done in the world. So I must see to it quickly; and to-morrow morning early, I will run over to the Bishop's and tell him all, and urge upon ,him the necessity of immediate action. I'm a great mind just to get up and do it now, and have the whole thing ended; but then this   Dinner-table Talk--Rev. Mr. Earle.     153 would not be exactly right; besides, I want it public- let the whole world see that the Church is right, and that even bigoted Baptists have to submit to her holy teachings. "Miss Dayleah, you do look so'disthressed," ejaculated Bridget Mahoney, entering the room. "What's the mat- ther wid ye, me lady? Ah, yees, yees, thinkin' o' that baby what's gone to the lan' o' darkness, an' o' this fine leetle darlint that's in the very same like dangher.

"Goode gracious, Miss Dayleah! who ever heerd o' sich thingl Not tach'd in the Bible, 'spose it ain't, don't the most holy mother church tache it, plain and shoore. Who ever heerd such a thing? Well, I just knows what Bridget Mahoney will be doin' some o' these days. bliss Dayleah, please, mam, to give me the pastry kays. I'm in dreadful hurry 'bout Miss Lilleah's cake and things for the picker-nicker, to-morrow." The guests were gone. Taking Lilly out on the grass- plot in the moonlight, Miss Delia seated her and thus advised: "Lilly Vernon, I tell you we must be up and doing, or we shall never get the baby baptized in this world. If he is not baptized before that ogre of a preacher gets here, it will not be done at all, for they say, Lilly, that he turns all the people's heads, not only the Baptists, you know that is easily done, for they, poor things, don't know much--but every- body's, and does with them just what he pleases, and they all, Episcopalians as well as others, think it all right. Once in his hands, Herbert will never be convinced. How thank- ful I am that I've managed to have Dr. Cheney come before     154       Ecangel Wiseman. this Mr. Earle's visit. And I tell you, Lilly, no time is to be lost. You and Annie must go to work as soon as this picnic is over and make the robe. Mrs. Montgomery has a splendid one for her baby; get it, it will be a fine guide to to you. Spare no pains nor expense. Have everything charged to me; I will see the bill paid. Explain the whole matter to Annie and Fannie Cheney, at the picnic to-  morrow; do it quietly, so that no one will hear. I'll go over as soon as you leave, to see the Bishop, and urge upon him the necessity of being thorough and strong, so that  S Herbert will be compelled to yield. Do you understand,  i  Lilly?" "Oh yes, aunty, and will do just as you say." ' And, Lilly, I want you to promise me one thing more;  that is, you won't go to any of these Baptist meetings. I never want to see your head turned like your sister's.'  The young girl hesitated; she had promised Fannie Eaton to attend frequently. "Promise me, Lilly. There's no use nor sense in your  going. Episcopalians ought to stay at home and attend to   their own affairs. Enough to do in our own church without !! running abroad. I shall never submit to your getting your head turned, and to see you set aside the authority of the true Church, denying her most sacred ordinances, and run- ning around after every new-fangled and old-fashioned notion. I don't see what this world is coming to anyhow. Everything is 'topsy-turvy, upside down and inside out,' as Betsey says. There's Mrs. Minden, our dear friend, that's had to read these Baptist books, and now she can't have her baby baptized, and that too, after having had a half-dozen children baptized, and her husband a prominent vestry-man too. And Mrs. Gregory must be taking on ,airs, but no better could be expected of her. She was raised one -    ,          E [   Dinner-table Talk-Rev. Mr. Earle.    155 of these-what do you call them?-Campbellites ; yes, one of these, and they do just like the Baptists, never have their dear little ones baptized. Poor ignorant woman, she doesn't know any better, I suppose. But just think of it  It's actually too bad. Now, I don't want you to get con- taminated by going to these Baptist meetings. ' Evil com- munications corrupt good manners,' the poets say. Do you suppose Evangel would ever have acted as ihe has done, if she had not married a Baptist? No, not one bit of it. And now, Lilly Vernon, I want you to promise me, just here, that you will not go to one of these Baptist meetings." Lilly still hesitated, for she did not wish to offend aunt Delia. "Why don't you promise me, Lilly Vernon; are you turn- ing crazy, too?" "I hope not, aunty. But I told Fannie Eaton to-day that I would go sometimes. She said she would call for me, for she knew I would be interested in Mr. Earle. She heard him while at Vassar." "Well, well, what a foolish girl you are--just like all the rest, running hither and thither. I had hoped, Lilly Ver- non, that you would have had some sense." And Miss Delia turned off into the house, leaving Lilly to her own cogita- tions 'neath the moonlight.     156     .Evangel Wiseman. CHAPTER X. THE PIC-NIM AND THE BISHOP'S VISIT. UESDAY morning dawned in gorgeous glory. The sun danced and shimmered o'er steeple and housetop; amid the laughing leaves of the sturdy old trees, and athwart the velvet lawn, and o'er the leaping waters of the saucy brooklet. All the young people of Chester were wide S awake early, for the " committee of five " had invited almost everybody, and also made hearty arrangements for their entertainment.                      X How skillfully that old gentleman of the Evil Eye manages ' to keep people's minds employed with the innocent amuse- ments of this world, that heaven and holy things may be excluded as much as possible! The people of God were going to have a meeting, that the truths of the Gospel might be presented to all who would hear. And "the people of the world" must have a grand dancing pic-nic for the pur- I pose of enjoyment. And they had given such energy,   I 'and time, and lavish expenditure of money to it, that comrn- plete success was guaranteed. "Are not the children of the world wiser in their generation than the children of light?"  Chartered cars stood in waiting at the depot, to convey the hundreds of Joyous ones to Laurel Hill, a beautiful wooded elevation twenty miles out from Chester south-  ; ward. At eight all were on board, and the iron horse, gathering all his energies, strode off with magnificent pace and puff, onward by houses, lanes, villages, and' woodlands, until he drew up at "Depot No. 10." Here   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.     157 the throngs, dressed in every variety of color and costume, and accompanied by Teinger's brass band, pressed forth to reach on foot the cool inviting knoll which lay just before them. The "Committee on Edibles," piled their baskets mountain high into the spring wagons, in waiting. And Berton, the confectioner of the occasion, kept vig- ilant watch over his ices and cakes, candies and pies. Beauty and grace-in the gay ladies, gallantry and wit in the gentlemen, were everywhere seen and felt. Parties distributed themselves in groups of various account beneath the grateful shade of the sturdy old trees, until like "In olde dayes of the Kinge Artour, Of which the Bretons speke in gret honour, All the land seemed filled of faeries." And had Chaucer, from  the shade of his oak at Don- nington Castle, witnessed it, we might have had a story sweet, outvying Spencer's Faery Queen. Unrivaled in beauty of person, elegant grace, suavity of manner and verve at repartee, Miss Mordaunt of New Orleans, stood amid the gay throngs, who sought accord- ing to taste or fancy, to press happiness from the fleeting hours. The band gave a lively air which rang reverberatingly through the quiet lands of Laurel Hill, and gathered quickly on the green sward --- "A giddy crowd Of thoughtless mortals, vain and loud, Who tripped with jocund heel along, And bade you join their smiling throng." More than one heart beat high with life and hope- more than one crest-fallen knight sought the deep impen- etrable shade, to brood over his ill-starred destiny, as the     158       Evangel Wiseman. alternate smile, or nonchalant look of the Crescent City Belle gave joy, or aroused vexatious disappointment. There was no one present whose bosom vibrated faster "betwixt alternate hope and fear," than our friend Will- iam Nesbitt. He no longer thought of the horrors of Catholicism, nor shrunk from the disclosures of the con- fessional, while gazing on the matchless beauty, and lis- tening to the silvery laugh and mellow voice of her whose image was now stereotyped on his soul. "A fatal dart By cupid guided, now transfixed his heart,"  and he is to be. henceforth led by the silken cords of love to a fate which he little knows.  .  Fannie Eaton and  others of her membership did not dance. This appeared so peculiar to Lilly Vernon and the  members of her congregation, who  were first to answer the inspiriting call of the music. Those who did not dance were regarded very puri- tanical by those who did.  But they were independent   of public opinion, and dared to do what they deemed    I right. Nor did they want for enjoyment, for lively con-  ! versation, and sweet songs, and the gathering of the tiny star flowers and wild violets, and various lichens and musci X which grew   so profusely in this charmed spot, whiled  ; away the time-most pleasantly. "It is only a difference of opinion," remarked Miss Mor- daunt to Mr. De Witt, a member of Dr. Eaton's church. - "Yes, Miss Mordaunt, I admit it is a difference of opin- ion, but not that alone. It is a difference of principle as well, We   are taught to do right, because Christ has commanded.  You are taught to do what the church permits, without regard to its moral bearing. You will   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.    159 not eat meat on Friday because men say you must not, for there is no Bible prohibition, and I will not dance because it is enjoined upon me " to avoid the very appearance of evil."  ' And do you regard the innocent amusement of dancing as evil, Mr. De Witt?" replied the gay lady, with holy horror, as she threw back her soft hair from her forehead, and adjusted the jaunty little hat with its pheasant wing, while Willie Nesbitt knelt before her, fanning -her with most majestic swoops. "' Whether it is really evil or not, Miss Mordaunt, I will not attempt to discuss or decide. But the fact that a public judgment of a religious community passes sentence against it, when practiced by a professed follower of Christ, is proof that it at least has the appearance of evil. The con- demnatory judgment of the public should, I think, aside from all other considerations, deter all who profess to follow our Saviour from engaging in it." "Your argument is very good, doubtless, Mr. De Witt. But I should never belong to a church that did not permit mne to dance and play an innocent game of cards. These are our favorite pastimes in our city." Just at this moment, Mr. Langford, the eldest son of the firm of Langford &; Co., commission merchants, stepped up to claim Miss Mordaunt's hand for the next set, and, e excusing herself with most beautiful naivete left the two gentlemen to admire her retreating form, while she joined the dance. "Splendid, De Witt," ejaculated Willie Nesbitt, " a queen and yet a fairy." ' And one who will prove the distraction of my friend's peace of mind," retorted De Witt, "unless he guards his emotions better than he is now doing."     16bU      lGvangel Wiseman. "But don't you think her beautiful, De Witt?" "Beautiful she is, Nesbitt, in form and feature. But, my boy, beauty is an over weening, self-sufficient thing, careless of providing itself any more substantial ornaments. Nay, so little does it consult its own interests, that it too often defeats itself by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and desirable. I just give you a word of friendly warning, m boy, lest you find yourself unexpectedly stranded." ' Oh, De Witt, none of your homilies. Can't a man ask  a civil question, and get a civil answer without all this  proemial? I want you to tell me plainly, don't you think  she is magnificent, De Witt?"  "' She is fairest of faire, and fairenesse itself doest excel,  in the words of your favorite Spencer. But let me say to  you, as Plato said to Dion, 'Friend, beware of that folly by which men please themselves, and despise a better judg- ment.' Think, Nesbitt: "' What rocks in secret lie-what tempests rise On love's deceitful voyage."'  "Pshaw, De Witt, what makes you talk so! Have I said,  or even intimated, that I am in love with Miss Mordaunt?" "No, Nesbitt. But looks, my boy, more than words can do, betray the feelings of the heart. Have you forgotten what you said a few evenings since, in speaking of Miss Mordaunt?"                        i The young man colored deeply. Oh, I must not allow my prejudices to control me, De Witt. I Perhaps this matter of confessional has been misrepresented to me." "Could she have spoken falsely, Nesbitt-your dying sister-when she warned you, from her own experience, to turn aside from all who confess to man? No, Nesbitt,   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.    161 she spoke the truth, standing in the very vestibule of the world above. You know her love for you, her fate, her repentance, her warning, her death. Remember and be wise." And the young man turned and walked off, leaving the love-stricken youth to his own reflectons, Thursday evening came.  Throughout the day, Miss Delia and Bridget Mahoney had been making the grandest preparations for the supper to which Dr. Cheney had been especially invited. Various conserves and sweet- meats stood temptingly ready in the pantry awaiting to be transferred to the supper table. Miss Delia was a splendid cook, and she prided herself on her skill in the culinary department, as. much as on her management in the nursery. No bought mince meat, nor pies, nor cakes, where Miss Delia presided. She " left these for trifling house-keepers who were too indolent to do their duty." Unsympathizing Miss Delia I She had never known what it is to plod on day after day, under the ever-accumu- lating burden of wife, mother, housekeeper, seamstress, maid of all work, with only the shadow of help in the form of a green Irish girl, or worse, an "independent darkie." It had beef a day of perturbed thought and feeling in "Our Home," as well as one of incessant activity and bustle. Evangel's doubts and fears had been dis- tressingly painful. All her old views and perplexities revived with redoubled force, and the probabilities of the issue, of the coming controversy were equally harrassing. She longed to come to God that she might find rest. "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Oh! how often had she repeated those precious words of promise to her throbbing heart! 10     162       Evangel Wzseman. How she strove to come to Jesus that these painful throb- bings might be quieted! "I must seek until I find!" she exclaimed aloud, as she sat beside the cradle of her sleeping babe, alone with God, and her own thoughts. "How blest it is to trust unceasingly in Christ--to realize even amid deepest trial, that as a father pitieth his children, so God pitieth' them that fear Him. He knows we are but grass. To lie down   on His bosom and rest calmly, knowing that ] as our day so shall our strength be, and that when our way is darkest, and our path thorniest, He is guiding us onward and upward to that better and enduring inheri-    tance. Oh I shall I ever find rest from all these crushing doubts and fears. Sometimes a glimmer of light and a faint hope of peace, then darkness unbroken, and unspeak- able anguish. How long, how long, shall I be thus cast  down? Shall I never rise to the full assurance of undoubt- ing trust." The tears would stream from her eyes, and her bosom heave with uncontrollable emotion, while deep  j sighs escaped from her tortured breast. The Father's hand was leading her, but she perceived it not. The evening came. All things were in perfect read- iness. Mr. and .Mrs. Vernon, Lilly and Annie had come,  j all highly anxious to know the result of Dr. Cheney's evening arguments. That Mr. Wiseman would be con-    : vinced no one doubted but Evangel. She knew that he   X had faithfully studied the Word of God with a view to  I find what it teaches, that he might in humble fear walk  according to Christ's commandments.- Miss Delia, at the Bishop's suggestion, had so managed that Dr. Eaton should not be present. She had to admit ! to herself, from her observations on the day of the dining, that " if he were mediocre in appearance," he was i   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.    163 anything else but this in intelligence. Evangel had pro- posed to her husband that he should be invited to be present, but Miss Vernon  demurred so violently she thought it best to submit. Mr. Wiseman was home early. Like Dr. Cheney, he too had clearly studied the contra side of the question. He had examined all their authorities, all their argu- ments, and felt more than ever convinced that they were wrong in toto. His earnest desire was so to present the subject that his wife especially, and her parents, should be convinced. Of Miss Delia he had no hope. She would contend that the baptized babies names were mentioned in the Bible, though she had never yet been successful i fiending them. Mr. Wiseman rested and refreshed his memory by reviewing his line of argument and his authors. Vefy soon, with books beneath both arms, and pockets filled with manuscript notes, and references, the Bishop walked up the gravel path, and was received with hearty . welcome.                           He was most affable, supporting a cheerful and urbane exterior. But could we have looked beneath the surface into his inner mind, there might have been discovered there certain misgivings and apprehensions, regarding the result of the coming discussion. He was assured he could not throw dust into Mr. Wise- man's eyes, by persuading him to take for granted what was not proved; and to prove clearly from the Bible the necessity of baptizing infants, to one of penetration and reasoning, he scarcely felt himself competent. The controversy, of course, must be delayed until Miss Delia's tea had been partaken of. In the meantime, con- versation flowed freely and pleasantly.     164       Evangel Wiseman. Tea was beautifully and amply served. Miss Delia had exerted herself to the utmost to have all things far beyond lordinaire, and the enjoyment manifested by all present, as they partook of the various dishes, attested how fully she had succeeded. Tea was over. Rather an awkward interval intervened, until the Bishop, feeling that his efforts, which had been so arduous, must not be lost, proposed they should proceed-  a proposition in which all acquiesced. The large marble center-table was placed in the middle of the room, beneath the brilliantly lighted chandelier. On it were laid the books of the respective disputants, together with the MSS., etc., etc., of Dr. Cheney, who, par excellence,  was assigned the head, which position he accepted with  grace. To the Doctor's right sat Miss Delia. She had   o made up her mind to enjoy the debate and the Bishop's triumph. To the Doctor's left sat Evangel, vis-a-vis to Miss  Delia. At the foot presided Mr. Vernon-to his left Mrs.  Vernon, and between this lady and Miss Delia, sat Annie Chiles. It was a most beautiful tableau, and strikingly  reflected by, the large mantel mirror. Every face was smiling save that of the Bishop-his wore  a shade of care,-and Evangel's, over which rested a sweet  look of calm sorrow. Miss Delia was radiantly triumphant.  And when the Bishop drew forth from the back pocket of  his coat a huge roll of manuscript, and laid it on the table : before him, she nodded across to Mr. Wiseman with a most significant smile, which he returned with like affableness.  "Well," said the Bishop by way of exordium, after all  arrangements seemed made, "We are here to-night for a  purpose that necessarily involves some discussion, which,  of course, will be conducted in the most friendly and  candid manner. The result, whatever it may be, will be ' '       '"           " a   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.   165 fraught with serious importance to all present. You are all well aware that the subject to be discussed-the point at issue-between my friend, Mr. Wiseman, and myself is 'infant baptism,' which I regard as a holy ordinance practiced, as I believe, by the Church in all ages since the times of the apostles-commanded by the word of God, where, on investigation, we shall find several instances on record. And thus believing it to be of divine and ecclesiastical authority, we administer it in all instances where opportunity offers." Miss Delia smiled delightedly at the Doctor's clear and pointed statements, and giving the left cuff sundry twitches, adjusted herself to play the attentive listener. "The Church administers this ordinance to all children of every age, under whatever circumstances they may be presented, I suppose, Doctor?" "Yes, sir, this is the practice of the Church now." "It will be absolutely necessary, Doctor, that we under- stand, each other fully in the outset, so that there shall be no waste of time or words in going over ground once trod. So we both know now that children of all ages, from an hour old, are the proper subjects of baptism, as admin- istered by your church to them. And, moreover, that this is the belief and practice of your church." "You have stated correctly, Mr. Wiseman," replied the Doctor, feeling the ground was very latitudinous. "Moreover, I argue from the comprehensiveness of that practice, that your church regards this rite, as she admin- isters it, of vital importance to the salvation of the soul of the baptized child. Am I correct in this deduction?" The Doctor hesitated a moment, as if to decide how to answer this pointed interrogative. All eyes were fixed upon him. He was confused, for it drove him to a ground     166       Evangel Wiseman. which he did not wish to occupy, and which indeed, in his own conscience, he did not adopt. After some pause, quite trying to Miss Delia, who won- dered at it, he said: "I will answer you in the formula of our church, so that you may know fully how she understands and teaches. Before we administer the rite, we pray that 'the infant coming to holy baptism may receive remission of sin by spiritual regeneration,' and we pray God 'to sanctify this water to the mystical washing away of sin.' And the parent, or who ever presents the child for baptism, is taught by the church that the child thus bantized 'is regenerated  and grafted into the body of Christ's church.' And the parents are then called upon to give thanks to Almighty God that it has pleased Him to regenenerate himn (the child) with His Holy Spirit, to receive him for His own  child by adoption, and to-incorporate him with His church.  "Very strong language, Doctor. Let me ask, Do your Bishops and writers agree on this point of regenerative  power in baptism?"  "They do, sir. And that you may teel assured this     l is so, I have here made five extracts on this very point from our best and most prudent men, and those of other  denominations, who have written in the various ages of the world. I will begin with Mr. Melville, considered by all evangelical, and certainly, as all must admit, by no means too rigid. Hear him: 'We believe it to be specially, and through the sacrament of baptism, the Holy Spirit acts in renovating the nature which became corrupt through the  apostacy.' And further, he says: 'We really think no fair, straightforward dealing can get rid of the conclusion that the church holds what is called baptismal regeneration.' You may dislike the doctrine-may wish it expunged    The Pwic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.   167 from the Prayer-book--but so long as I subscribe to the Prayer-book, and so long as I officiate in accordance with the forms of that Prayer-book, I do not see how I can be commonly honest, and yet deny that every baptized  person is, on that account, regenerate." "A moment's interruption, Bishop. It appears to me, from your last quotation, that there is some question, even among yourselves, on this very point of regenerative bap- tism." "Yes, yes, this is so, to a limited extent. Some uneasy, unsettled minds will question and cavil, because they vainly imagine that repentance and faith must precede baptism." Evangel listened with the most intense anxiety. Every word of the Bishop was like a sharp sword piercing through her soul. Mr. Wiseman observed her expres- sion, and fully appreciating her feelings, determined to give her strained heart some relief. Miss Delia was charmed. "Now," she said to herself, "they will not dare to let Vernon go unbaptized." "Your church must admit, Bishop, that the word of God is authoritative on every subject." "Certainly, certainly, sir. We do not, like the Catholics, reject the Bible." "Then: I would ask you, where within the lids of the New Testament do you find a command to be baptized, where repentance and faith are not enjoined as a personal experience?" "But you know, Mr. Wiseman, there exists a great difference of opinion on this very subject. You insist upon the former doctrine; others vitally disagree with you. You both prove your respective tenets from the sacred Scrip- tures." "Suppose, then, Bishop, by way of settling this vital     168      JEvangel Wiseman. issue, we turn for a moment to the Bible, and get its testi- mony, which certainly is superlatively authoritative above any mere church tenet or decree of council." Evangel breathed more freely. She had endured agony for the last few. minutes, in the thought that perhaps the church dicta, the Prayer-book and Mr. Melville might be right, after all. A look of painful solicitude had set- tled over her face, and her lips were bleached to white- ness. By mighty effort she preserved an apparent calmness, but the tumult of her feelings was unspeakable. Since the death of Herbert she had become so sensitive on the question of infant baptism, that the least appearance of proof for baptismal regeneration, almost drove her to   I despair, inasmuch as it condemned her lost babe to end-   less misery, and that too through her own neglect.  One who has never passed through this fearful solici-   tude-this fiery ordeal with regard to the salvation of a lost child, can form no conception of what it is. Those who have passed through this furnace heated seven times, will be able to sympathize with this tried mother. Every pastor in the land should feel it Iis imperative duty to study this subject well, and in the light of God's own revelation to present it, not once but repeatedly, to his congregation, so that not only the bereaved shall under- stand it, but all who  hear,-that in times of distress every one may be prepared to comfort his neighbor with the sure words of promise, which alone can give light in the trying hour of bereavement.            Il How   eagerly Evangel caught at the first ray of relief t I If the Bible did teach that repentance and faith must   : precede baptism, and only those who were capable of    / repentance for sin, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ   l were to-be baptized, then it was not duty for children to [I   The Pic-nic and the Bishop's Visit.    169 have this ordinance administered to them, because they could neither repent nor exercise faith, nor could others do this for them. And this being the case, Herbert was not lost for want of baptism,- nor had she neglected her duty. It was like a voice from heaven, bringing to her throbbing bosom a moment of sweet peace. But now the tempter came and whispered: "But the Bible may not teach repentance and faith as pre-requisites to baptism, and after all the baptism of children, as essential to salva- tion, may be taught." "Let us, Mr. Wiseman, before turning to the Bible to look out this matter, learn what other authorities have, to saf on the subject. I have great respect for the views of eminent men, and I wish to show you that authors of this, and other countries have firmly believed, and per- severingly advocated baptismal regeneration. And after seeing their views, if it be necessary we will--" Just then a loud and nervous ring of the door-bell star- led the party from their seats. "If you please, Herbert, Bridget has the baby." "Walk -in, Mr. Patterson," said Mr. Wiseman, encoun- tering his friend. "No, thank you, Mr. Wiseman, I am in great haste. Is Dr. Cheney here, sir? I have just been to his house, and they told me he was here. Mr. John Nesbitt's little son is very ill--dying I am afraid, and they wish the Doctor to come immediately and baptize him." "Yes, he is in. I will speak to him, Mr. Patterson." "Quickly, if you please, Mr. Wiseman. The child is exceedingly low, and they request that he come without a moment's delay. The mother is almost frantic, fearing he may die before he is-baptized." Mr. Wiseman returned hastily to the parlor and deliv- ered the message to the Doctor.     170       Evangel Wiseman. "I must go, of course," said he. "As much as I should be glad to remain, and follow out this point, the call is one of distress, and cannot be set aside." And the  Doctor commenced to gather up his manuscript and notes.  "Leave your papers, Doctor, and return to-morrow evening. We must see this matter through now, sir. There is too much involved to let it remain thus unde- cided." "Yes, Doctor," intervened Miss Delia, whose heart sank within her at the inopportune interruption of what she felt sure would prove a decisive testimony in favor of infant baptism. "We will take good care of your books and papers, and they will be in readiness for to-morrow. Be sure to come, Doctor, for I am deter- mined Herbert, here, shall be convinced, and the baby baptized." All present united in the pressing invitation to return, which the Doctor accepted with a most urbane bow. Bidding them "good-evening," he hastened away with* Mr. Patterson, to administer the holy rite of baptism to the unconscious dying child. Strange infatuation As if anything that man can do, could remove sin, or prepare any soul for entrance into the spiritual kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ!"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." "And this is one of your Baptist sisters, Herbert," said Miss Delia tauntingly, as she carefully gathered up the Bishop's papers, to put them away securely. "A beautiful  comment, truly, on all the teachings of your church and of Dr. Eaton. That boy of Mrs. Nesbitt's is at least ten years  old! She has been prevailed upon by your teachings to neglect its baptism all this time, but now when her child is ready to die, she sees how shei has failed in her duty.   The Pic-nic and the Bis   's Vis.   171 It will be well for her if the boy isn't dead before Dr. Cheney gets there." I was not aware that Mrs. John-Nesbitt was a Baptist, Mr. Wiseman," remarked Mrs. Vernon, drawing back from the table. "Nor is she, Mrs. Vernon; although she has been bap- tized, and has been a member of the Baptist church in some other section of the country." "Why, she attends Dr. Eaton's church, Evangel tells me, and you say she has been baptized, Herbert. If this isn't being a Baptist, I don't know what is " "She is only a Baptist by profession. A mere chance case-came into the church under peculiar circumstances, without understanding any of our principles. I have been informed that she was reared an Episcopalian, and after having grown up in that organization, was thrown into a Baptist family, and through the influence brought to bear upon her, united with the church and was baptized. But she says she knew nothing about it, knows nothing about religion, and should not be connected with any church. I suppose under the excitement of her great affliction, her old teachings and prejudices have been revived, and this is why she has sentqfor Doctor Cheney." "Anyhow she passes for a Baptist. Everybody looks upon her as such. I am so glad she is convinced of her duty, though it is at the eleventh hour. The world will say that one of your Baptist sisters had her baby baptized by the Bishop. What a triumph ifor truth " and Miss Delia laughed heartily at what she supposed must be Mr. Wiseman's discomfiture. "Even if Mrs. Nesbitt were an acknowledged Baptist in good standing, or a member of our church, and should, through the influence of early teaching, or fear, have her     172       Evangel Wiseman. dying child sprinkled, it would be no argument at all in favor of this practice, or against those' who disclaim it." "Well, well, whatever she may be or have been, I am so glad she is made to have her boy baptized. It is one more evidence- of the triumph of truth." "Or of error," responded Mr. Wiseman,. quietly. "Yes, yes, Herbert, that is always your way. If church- men leave us and go over to you, you call it the triumph of truth. Bad rule that can'tt work both ways." "But this rule does, aunty. Truth is truth wherever found, and error, error; and these are not changed by people's views nor people's changes." The mother was weeping and wringing her hands frantic- i ally by the bedside of her only boy. The Doctor- entered,  accompanied by Mr. Patterson. Sympathizing friends were near to alleviate, as far as human aid could do, the sad  I distress. But the great I Am had sent the summons, and   I the young spirit must obey. It was a message of infinite j love to the unstained soul, and a call of divine grace ,to the worldly-minded parent.  v        i$ "My child, Doctor I my dear boy I my precious Charley!" shrieked the mother, as she was made aware of the presence/ of the Bishop.  "See, see, he is dying! Oh, if anything can be done for him I If his soul can be saved, I beseech you now, now!"And she fell beside the death-stricken form and wept, as only a mother can do under such aful circumstances. Preparations for the ceremony were quietly made by the ladies present, and after the usual formula, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the water was sprinkled on the marble forehead of the unconscious child, whose breathing was even now scarcely perceptible. A few minutes more, and the little form was still.   Incidents.-C oming Events.      173 CHAPTER XI. INCIDENTS.-COMNG EVENTS. IT was a sweet, calm evening in early May- the bloom- ing queen of spring. The "Richmond," crowded with passengers, landed at the wharf of Memphis. After the boat was made secure, descending the steps might have been seen a handsome man of about thirty, bearing on his arm an invalid female. She looked to be about sixty, so worn and bent was she. Her feebleness was so great that it was with considerable difficulty she could make her way to the shore. Her face, marked by sorrow, was sweetly calm. For the Angel of Affliction had also been the Angel of Sanctification, and though treading the vales of earth her soul dwelt amid the sunlight of the heavenly glory. The trial had been grievous, but it had produced the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and her mild blue eye now so sad in its expression, wore a look of patient resig- nation most beautiful to behold. The earth-tenement was rapidly falling to pieces, as the spirit was being "Iothed upon with its house which is from heaven." She was clad in deepest mourning.!One month had passed since she had been called upon to say, "Thy will be done," as' she received the last /farewell from the dying lips of her only daughter. This beautiful being, in her nineteenth year, had fallen a victim to consump-  tion. After her death, the palatial residence on Brittan- nia street was forever darkened to .the mother's desolate bosom. Its earthly light was quenched, no more to be     174       Evangel Wiseman. renewed to that poor breaking heart, now pulsing on in obedience to the Iaster's will-every earth-tie severed- reverently looking and yearning for " that rest that remain- eth for the people of God." Yielding to the importunate solicitations of devoted friends, Mrs. B. had decided to pass a few months with her relatives in Memphis. To her it mattered but little where she was, or how surrounded. Her soul held sweet converse, day by day, with that eternal world just beyond the vale of flesh. The young man on whose strong arm she leaned, had been for months past an inmate of her household. A rela- tive of her deceased husband, on his arrival in New Orleans to enter into business, he had been kindly wel- comed in the magnificent home of Mrs. B. and her  daughter Emily. A beautiful friendship had sprung up    between these kindred souls. It was not deep, passionate  love, which always embodies as its chie f characteristic : selfish gratification, - but a pure and holy friendship, stronger, more enduring, than passionate love. Already the hectic flush had crimsoned the fair round cheek of the beautiful girl, scarce eighteen years of age, when our young friend became an inmate of the family, and as - the winter wore on, the short dry cough gave fearful prep monitions. Physicians advised a change, and Emily was taken first to Florida, then to Cuba. For a while the for- midable enemy seemed check-mated, though not vanquished. Great hope sprung up in the bosom of the loving parent. The young girl herself talked cheerfully about a speedy recovery. The two returned in early spring to pass a few months in their native. city, before proceeding to St. Paul for the summer; and so improved was Emily's condition, that her physicians spoke flattering words of 6.               .      .   Incidents.-C oming Events.      175 promise of permanent improvement. Her many friends believed she would be saved. Her old family physician, Dr. La Croix, made a thorough examination,- and pro- nounced the symptoms more hopeful; beyond this he was reticent. Love catches at straws. So with these encouraging symptoms, hope returned to Mrs. B's heart. Would not God in compassion, spare this only child, the last of a large family who, with a kind husband, had all gone before to the heavenly land? Surely He would, for she trusted in Him. Her soiul claimed this one boon-she believed the Father would grant it. But He who sitteth in judgment on the circle of the heavens, knows what is, best for His children, and orders all things for their eternal good. He sees it best oftimes to put out the light of the mortal eye, that the eye of faith may discern more fully the magnificent provisions of His wisdom and love. Of the eight children that God had given her, three had died early, before the heart had rebelled against God, and rejected the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of the four who had grown to years of discretion, the two sons, George and Alfred, and the daughters, Sarah and Caroline, she had well-grounded hope that they slept in Jesus. The parents were devoted mepmbers of Dr. aalmer's church, and had, from their earliest infancy, faithfully instructed their children in the truths of the Gospel, and from their youth they had known the Scrip- tures that make wise unto salvation. They had been taught that a change of heart was necessary-that they must exercise faith in Christ- and by faith they had laid hold on the promises of eternal life. And thus, parents and children had found that God is the rewarder of all who diligently seek Him.     176       Evangel Wiseman  After some stay in New Orleans, Mrs. B. and Emily repaired to Minnesota to pass the summer. The mother fully hoped this change would confirm the improvement- made by the winter trip. Their young friend and relative accompanied them North for a summer vacation from business. After seeing them nicely domiciled in a suburban residence at St. Paul, in charge of Madeline Montmartre, the faithful French wait- ing maid, he proceeded to visit his friends in Kentucky, and took then the tour of the North, making stay at such places as attracted and pleased him, returning in time to: conduct the mother and Emily back to New Orleans. Emily appeared to have been greatly benefited by the pure, bracing air of the Northern climate. The hectic flush had paled, and the eye had lost measurably its un- natural brightness. Loving friends crowded round- het with warm   congratulations, and words of fond hope.  ii But the young girl felt the canker worm at the vitals,  i! and in response to what could flatter and encourage hope, would confidently urge her own convictions that she should never be restored to health. And even when her symptoms gave almost indubitable evidence of recov- ery she would, with a sweet smile, say: "It is not pos- sible I shall be with you many weeks more."      'f What is it within us that thus in so many cases assures the soul with such certainty of its speedy release? Is it intuition, reason, judgment? Is it not rather the voice of our Father, whispering, "Child, I have need of thee; come up higher "? Soon after reaching New  Orleans, Emily contracted cold-her mother, who watched over her with sleepless anxiety, could never tell how. In a few weeks the old disease manifested itself with marked and aggravated symp- toms.   Incidents.-Coming Events.      1" It was proposed and urged upon Emily that she should pass the winter as before, in Florida and Cuba. But the invalid firmly opposed the movement. No entreaty could win her assent. She preferred to remain at home, and take the consequences, whatever they might be, rather than risk dying among strangers. Dr. La Croix, seeing her reluctance to travel, did not encourage the trip. He knew that now nothing could be done, but to prolong for a season the life which, until its close, must be one of painful suffering. Winter wore on, the season of gay and fashionable life and voluptuous enjoyment, in the beautiful city of the orange and the vine. The grand gala day of the sea- son-Christmas-found our young friend confined to her bed. She had long been forbidden more extended limits than those of her room and verandah. Beautifully patient was the cheerful sufferer. Day by day she was nearing the land where there is no pain, no death. Full well she realized her rapid journey thitherward; and she was fast becoming acquainted with the Celestial City and the inhabitants thereof. With firm fixed faith, she was looking forward to the crown of rejoicing which she knew the Lord, her righteous judge, should give her. What scene on earth could be more sublime than this? How glorious is the blessed gospel of the Son of God, which can thus rob death of all terror and clothe him in the habiliments of a kind friend, who unlocks the prison door and bids the captive go free--imparting the same unspeakable hope to- the beggar on his pallet of straw, and the king who lays aside his scepter and crown of earthly grandeur to receive the crown of everlasting royalty which shall be placed upon the brow of every follower of Jesus.     178       Xvangel Wiseman. The spring came with its orange blossoms and snowy magnolias. Exquisite beauty dwelt everywhere-all earth was gorgeously arrayed in her wedding robes of life.  And could earthly beauty and- earthly love woo the spirit from its heavenly journey, then would Emily have turned  her longing eyes from the celestial Beulah, each day unfold-  ing more wondrously beautiful before her enraptured gaze,  that she might linger yet awhile on the plains of mortality. i But the mansion of rest in the Father's house, and the Lamb  the light thereof,-and the beckonings of loved ones gone  before-and the voice of the Master which stole in upon her soul, saying, in inviting voice, "Child, come up higher," ; and the sweet cadences of the harpings of the harpers-- floating down upon her attuned being--enticed her feet onward and upward, and now she was only awaiting the  messenger angel, who should come to bear her away to her estates in heaven. It was the Lord's day--a calm, holy evening in late  \ April. The sun, declining in gorgeous beauty, was merg- ing his gold and crimson in the purple of the lake, while the' breath of delicious flowers burdened the stirring air. Beneath an open window, through which the breezes mur. mured and the sunlight fell, the dying girl lay, exchanging earth with all its beauties for that land whose glories eye hath never seen. She bade adieu to mother and friends calmly, as sinking to a night's repose; then, folding the  transparent hands on the sunken bosom, " fell asleep in Jesus." Charmed sleep after the conflict of death I Bliss- ful rest with Jesus, after passing through the waves of Jordan I From the death chamber of the young saint went forth the words of eternal life to the friend she had loved so well-messages of warning and entreaty, which should *i   Incidents Co   ing  vens.     179 Incidents.-Ctoming Events.      179 haunt his soul until the wanderer should return to his Father's house; and as he stood that May evening on the wharf in Memphis, awaiting a hack, that voice, though dead still speaking, pleaded with him to be reconciled to God. A word for the Master cannot be lost. He will Him- self see that it does not return void. The young man, tenderly assisting Mrs. A. into the carriage, directed the hackman to drive to No. - on Adams street; and as the boat would remain only a short time at the wharf, after seeing that she was kindly wel- comed, he bade her an affectionate farewell, and returned on board. Soon the splendid steamer was cleaving the waters of the Mississippi, on her way to St. Louis. What diversity'of character is to be encountered on board one of our large Western steamers I And what a study of human nature is offered to the observant and reflect- ive mind! Denizens of every portion of our wide-spread country are thrown together in close proximity, if not strict relationship. The glad and gay, the morose and sad, the old and young, the good and bad--each a separate study- each a complex, yet independent existence I There, retired, sits the widow in deepest weeds, mourning the husband she has laid away to sleep in the land of strangers. But a few months since, and she went forth from the sheltering home- stead, with bounding hope and joyous soul; now she is returning to the family hearth alone and heart-broken. Her young life is a history in itself.' There, amidst the group of motherless children, sits the wifeless father. He is bearing his little desolate ones to the far-off home of the aged grandmother, who weeps inconsolably over the death of her youngest born. And there, with wasted form and pallid features, stands against the guards the prematurely oidlman with whitened hair, whose life has been given to     180       Evangel Wiseman. the world and its demands,. and who vainly hopes that  change of scene and air may prolong an existence which, if protracted, will only be one of wretchedness. The  recording angel will have written down his life-deeds from the cradle to the grave. What an unfolding when " the Books " are read!                      There, surrounded by admirers, is the young belle of fash-  ion, who has made her debut in society during the past  winter, and pursued a round of fashion so giddy and false,  that all thought of real life and religion have fled her foolish  brain. It may be that for her there is already " the hand- )" writing on the wall," though she perceives it not.

The tout- ensemble is laughably ridiculous, and the observer jots them down in his memory for future use. Here by your side in the large ' fauteuil," as much at ease as the king at "Sans Souci," sits, in all the emblazon of the last modes, the fashionable woman, with her half- dozen big trunks packed full of furbelowed dresses, and expensive jewels, etc., etc., bound to Saratoga for the watering season. And there sits Ithe sensible mother, with her half dozen children grouped around her in overflowing enjoyment, escaping from the heat and dust of the crowded city, that her juveniles may find the quiet and fresh air of the country, where the boys can fish and frolic, and the girls ride on horseback and riot in the woodlands. On board the "Richmond," during the trip of which we are now speaking, was a young lady who particularly interested our traveler. She was beautiful in person,  that fresh soul-beauty which ever fixes attention and wins love,--tall and graceful in form, with large gray eyes, and hair in which the midnight slept. And her complexion defied all the cosmetics of Jouvip to add one tint of beauty. She possessed also refinement and cul- tivation of mind and excellence of character. Frank, brim full of sympathy, and energy, she was the beloved sister of a large family. Her parents had sent her to one of the best schools in Kentucky, and her education was good. But she had never possessed any remarkable taste for the scientific and abstruse. She was practical in her views-one of those minds which could never be imposed upon by the idiosyncrasies of spiritualism. And were you /      Evangel Wiseman. to talk to her about Theodicy, Anthropomorphism, The- urgy or the Alexandrian mysticism, she would turn her head disdainfully, and frankly tell you she knew nothing of "your absurdities." And for your display of wisdom you would have the consolation to know she regarded you as a mystagogue, or the hierophant of the Bhagarad Gita. She was, however, highly accomplished, and played and sang finely. But she loved songs of sentiment and airs of melody, and while other young ladies were operatically boisterous, she would charm you to tears with " Ben Bolt," "Last Rose of Summer," or "The Dying Child," or arouse you to excessive laughter by something comic, which she would render most apropos. You saw and felt that Isabella Lanier had genius, and you loved and admired her. She was the eldest of seven children. Her mother, a most judicious woman, had early taught Isabella the value of time, and the great beauty of self-sacrifice and usefulness. "To live for others, my daughter, rather than for your- self," she would often say, "will not only make you beloved, but will give you an inward joy which will be far more valuable to you than earthly treasures."  She possessed self-respect pre-eminently, with a very meager share of self-love. It was beautiful to see her assisting her mother with the younger children; keeping them from running into danger; seeing that they did not trespass on the comfort of the other passengers, nor play rude at the dinner table. She would sing and play for the passengers; laugh and talk with the gentlemen, old and young, and crochet the tidy as fast as her fingers could fly. Isabella was. a genuine character, as every one had to admit who came in contact with her. Our young friend thought her a   very interesting one too, and the soft sunset hour found them  often in conversation, mutually pleased and in- structed. Isabella was also a Christian. Her parents had been members of the Presbyterian Church since their mar- riage. She had united at sixteen, and with all her life and vivacity she was a consistent follower of the blessed Saviour. Reared in the bosom of the Presbyterian Church, she knew but little else religiously. She had a general idea of other denominations of Christians, but she was very little acquainted with their various distinctive features. She had always been impressed with the feeling that the Baptists were a people good enough in the main, but nar- row-minded and bigoted, staking everything on immer- sion, and that they were exceedingly unchristian in the particular of close communion, which she regarded as a most fearful bug bear. The Methodists shouted, and the Episcopalians danced; the Catholics kissed the Pope's toe, and the Campbellites dipped. Thus\tley stood pilloried before her mental vision. Isabella belonged to that class of Christians who believe "my doxy is orthodoxy, and everybody else's doxy is heterodoxy." In this particular she has a multitude of friends. The family were going to Kentucky to visit relatives in the vicinity of George- town,-where the Baptists have a fine college and a semi- nary for young ladies, which, if not a fashionable school, is a most highly respectable and thorough institution. She would necessarily be brought under the influence of that denomination, so as to make her acquainted with its distinguishing tenets and practices. What effect this knowledge will have on her views, we shall see by- and-by. Our young friend had intended, when leaving New    184       Evangel Wiseman. Orleans, to proceed by boat to St. Louis; but after be- coming acquainted with Miss Lanier, and finding her so pleasing, he decided to visit his friends in Kentucky be- fore going North. Consequently at Cairo he took passage with the family and accompanied them to Louisville. One evening, while steaming up the Ohio, he was sitting beside Miss Lanier on the hurricane decki gazing with meditative air into the -clear blue waters of " la belle rivire," and the varying landscape on either side, when the conversa- tion turned directly on New Orleans, and their respective acquaintances in the city. They found they had several  0 mutual friends. Taking from the inner pocket of his coat ' a beautiful inlaid case of oval shape, he opened it and ; handed it to Miss Lanier. "Emily Bowman!" she exclaimed, with an expression .  t of interest and surprise.                $ "And did- you know her, Miss Lanier?" he asked,    : fixing upon her averted face a look of sad and painful  , inquiry.      :  "I knew her well. We were Sabbath-school children together, and I loved her dearly. We attended the same  i church for years, Dr. Palmer's, but in the last two years 1] we have met but rarely. I saw a month ago that she had  died of consumption. You, of course, knew her well." "Yes," was the brief, abstracted response. "' She was a lovely girl, as pure as an angel, and I have  heard, was most happy in her death," continued Isabella, speaking with deep emotion as the remembrances of the sweet' face and gentle manner came vividly to her mind. "Is this so?" "It is indeed: not a cloud-not a dread. She died as peaceful and calm as the sinking to rest of a summer day. I have never known any death so beautiful as was hers. Dead deadI " he said to himself. 2   '  .              I   Incidents.--Coming Events.      185 The young man spoke with manifest emotion. His voice was low and full of sadness, and over his face and manner there stole a deep meaning, as, receiving the picture, he gazed with subdued look upon its heavenly features. i Dead I dead I '^ he repeated, " and so young and beau- tiful!" he whispered to himself. "I had not believed, Miss Lanier, that death could be go triumphant I " he rejoined after a long pause, as if unwilling to quit the subject. "Its every lineament was fearfully repulsive. Forbidding in its every aspect, I had ever turned from its contemplation with unspeakable horror, and felt that all men were mortal but myself. But now," and he again paused and looked thoughtfully on the picture, " that she has passed its por- tals and -left them all radiant with beauty, my views of it are changed-changedI " he repeated, more to himself than to the young lady beside him. Thoughts not to be uttered swept through Isabella's mind. She dared not intrude upon the sacredness of the young man's memories. Neither spoke further. Rising, as if by one impulse, the two proceeded to the cabin. Isabella mentioned the incident to her mother. "I had observed the gentleman wore a strangely sad look," replied Mrs. Lanier. "Perhaps he loved her." It was a glad and joyous company, that which set out from the old family mansion of Mr. B. near Georgetown, Kentucky, on that early morning in May. Greetings were passed, pledges given, wishes for a "prosperous journey and safe return," showered on the excursionists, and amid the waving of handkerchiefs and the exchange' of adieus, the carriages set out for Lexington, to meet the cars. The party consisted of Mr. Beaumont and his sister; Miss     186       Evangel- Wiseman. Isabella Lanier, their cousin;"William Robinson and his sister, Miss Eugenia Robinson; Mr. Wiseman, a younger brother of Herbert Wiseman, of Chester; and our friend from New Orleans. Their intention was to visit the eastern cities by way of Niagara Falls. They proceeded direct through Ohio, called at Put-in-Bay, passed a day and night there, then by sail over the beautiful lake, they reached Detroit, that city of exquisite cleanliness and unending supply of pure fresh water. From thence they proceeded through Canada to the Falls, that wonder of wonders, to all  who visit it for the first time. Our young friend from New Orleans was the only one   ! who had visited the Falls before, and as novelty is a power- : ful excitant of emotions of surprise and admiration, it was We no marvel that expletives of astonishment, amazement and enthusiasm fell thick and fast, as this company of ardent  natures stood, for the first time, beneath the grand old Horse-Shoe, and gazed up into its mighty face.    - Various Were the emotions, and various their expression. J Isabella Lanier, awe-struck, was affected to tears, while I Miss Eugenia Robinson became wildly voluble, and made her notes of exclamation heard amid the roar of the dash- ing waters.               *  "Well, isn't this 'the greatest wonder of the world,' truly 1" she exclaimed, so loud as to make the gentleman at her side understand. "I have heard all my life of this wonderful Niagara-have read lots of poetry about it, and g dreamed of it at night, but hadn't the faintest conception of its grandeur. I do wish I could stay here forever, with the roar of its mighty waters sounding in my ears It would give me a more exalted feeling, a more enlarged view of life. I do so detest monotonous quietude I There is certainly nothing in all this world so grand as this mighty old Niagara is, is there'"    Incidents.-Coming Euents.       18' "Nothing save the two sublime falls/of the great Yo- semite Valley," replied he. ", What, are they more wonderful than this Il It cannot be!"And -Miss Robinson stood still and gazed up into his face, with a look of child-like surprise and inquiry. "This is but a gentle cascade compared with the great Chaloohe and Po-ho-no of the Yosemite. Choloohe, accord- ing to geological survey, is twenty-eight hundred -feet high, and Po-ho-no, or the Bridal Veil, more than a thousand feet. So you see, Niagara in all its grandeur is not the greatest wonder in the world, but sinks into quite an insig- nificant waterfall by the comparison." "I cannot conceive of it I It is quite beyond my powers of comprehension. My mind staggers as I endeavorto lift it so high. How much I should delight to visit this famed valley, with its magnificent falls, and all its wondrous beauties!" "Have you ever seen the great Yosemite, sir?" asked Mr. Wiseman, as the party stood gazing on the burnished, billowy waters. "Yes," responded our friend. "Two years ago I stood on the Great Southern Dome, and looked down-down-. down three thousand feet, into this wonderful eye of creation." "Then do-do tell us all about it!" exclaimed Miss Robinson, seizing our friend's arm with a nervous grasp, and looking up wonderingly into his face with her large, sloey eyes. "I didn't dream that you had ever been there to see for yourself. I thought you had only been reading of all these striking things in books, and, you know, books do not always speak truth." "Do, do give us a description of your visit and of all you saw l" importuned Mr. Wiseman and Miss Lanier, taking  .    s     188       Evangel Wiseman. position close in front of him. "Let us hear. of these magnificent freaks of nature, here in the presence of old Niagara, that we may the better be able to form a just conception of their grandeur and impre ssiveness." At this juncture, Miss Beaumont and her escort, Mr. Robinson, who had played laggard, to gaze at the dashing spray and the spumy waters below, joined the party, and, understanding the nature of the request, added their eager demands for the recital. Thus surrounded on all sides, and pressed with unyield- ing volubility and importunity, our friend had to assent, though reluctantly, because he feared his inability either to do justice to the subject, or to satisfy the eager minds of his auditors.    ' "John, John!" cried Miss Beaumont, releasing her hold on Mr. Robinson's arm, and runninig toward her brother,  who had strayed off to gather a  tiny wild flower, as a I memento for a  young lady friend in Kentucky, and who having secured its fragile blue form, stood gating on it X admiringly, forgetting the Falls and the friends, "Comel I come I we are going to hear of the great Yosemite Valley, which you have been so crazy to visit for the last two years! '  The party soon found a quiet little solitude on the island. a And seating themselves like a company of Bohemian gip-  sies beneath one of those grand old trees, under which, at all hours of the day, may be seen the dirty Indian women of the Falls, with their long, lank fingers and ever- uncleaned nails, plying their beautiful 'bead work-so strangely contrasting with themselves that you are filled with wonder at the sight-"our friend" related to them the following adventure: "Two years ago, with a company of ten others, I set out   Inqidents.-Coming Events.       189 from San Francisco to visit this famed spot. I had read of it, and heard of it, until my mind teemed with wild, strange fancies, not to be satisfied with anything less than actual observation. We proceeded from San Francisco to Stockton, at which point we disembarked horses, Jersey wagons; provisions, etc., etc., and took up our line of journey by land to Mariposa, distant about one hundred miles. - Passing through a varied country, marked with fenced ranches, small unsightly settlements, isolated herds- men's huts, undulating plains-sometimes grassed, at others sterile-with now and then a hybrid town of Spanish 'make and Yankee furnishing, near Mariposa we came across the mammoth grove of giant trees, and saw those huge prostrate centenarians, called the Graces. One of them, the largest of the three, lay along the ground like some fallen monarch despoiled of all his greatness. Its trunk was stripped of bark, but gave, in answer to our measure- ment, a diameter of thirty-five feet. Its height, from the very best calculation we could make, must have been at least four hundred feet. The interior is burned out, and in its trunk grizzly bears make their cozy habitats. After a careful inspection of these marvelous monuments of past ages, and an accurate survey of the surrounding country, we again set forward, clambering up-up, as best we could for several miles, until at length a beautiful meadow of vast extent burst upon our view, whose emerald, as if turned to chrysoprase beneath the glaring beams of the noon-day sun, gratefully met our longing eyes, giving hope to our weary hearts. The far-up peaks of the mountain wall that enclosed this charmed spot, glistened and shivered in the brilliant sunlight like lances of gold." "How beautiful the scene!" exclaimed Isabella Lanier, unable longer to restrain her emotion, which had increased     190       Evangel Wiseman. every step of the way, as her vivid imagination pictured all that the traveler described, and threw in many a beauty which nature had not seen fit to bestow, until she saw -spread out before her a panorama far exceeding all the wondrous stories of Scheherazade. "It was, indeed, sublimely enchanting, Miss Lanier. To appreciate it must be seen, however. My poor powers of description fall so short of the reality that I feel lost in the attempt to picture it to you."  c"We must all see it," exclaimed Eugenia RIobinson. 4'I shall never be content until I do. Let us all, this fan, meet in St. Louis, and take a trip to the Yosemite. "Agreed I agreed I agreed " ejaculated each one of the party. Pledges were exchanged, the time decided upon, and all preliminaries hastily arranged, and Elgenia was already in anticipation of steaming over the plains.       i "Now that everything is done that can be done, let    us have the remainder of the trip," said Mr. Wiseman,  2 drawing nearer the speaker, his large blue eyes expres- sive of the intense interest he felt. "Leaving this beautiful table land, with its carpet of waving verdure, we plunged into dense forests, where thick interlaced branches shut out the glare of the day, making one feel as if he was journeying over enchanted ground, where elfins ply their midnight work, and fairies dance their weird rounds." We moved onward by easy marches until, suddenly turning an angle in the road, we stood unexpectedly on I Point Inspiration.'

The Tis-sa-ack with its beautiful legend, overlooks a soft green grass plat, while far down in the bosom of the valley, the Merced silently wends its curved way, with banks wood-fringed, and waters clear as crystal, while the Cholooke and Po-ho-no pour their ceaseless torrents from immeasurable heights, and the Sentinel Rock stands, a grim Boodh, to guard this enchanted land, where sleeps the placid Ah-wi-yoh; and, like spirits lost, murmur through sylvan glades ceaseless streamlets, ever seeking the bosom of the quiet lake. And all around, higher, higher, higher, rise, peak on peak, the eternal mountains, whose snow- capped brows, bathed in the cloudless sun, glitter like lances diamond set.

HE sudden departure of Dr. Cheney and the conse- quent abrupt postponement of the investigation, left the party assembled in the parlor of Mr. Wiseman in very various frames of mind. Miss Delia was sorely disappointed. She had confi- dently calculated on Mr. Wiseman being convinced by Dr. Cheney's clear Scriptural proof; and, per consequence, the  baptism of the baby would soon follow. All day she had i been suggesting to Lilly the make of the robe, and the various styles suggested had been freely discussed, until at length the matter was fully arranged, and the two ladies,  Annie and Lilly, were to have commenced the work the following morning. Now she saw the whole matter post- poned, she knew not how long, for she could not feel assured that Dr. Cheney would return the following evening.  Evangel was so desirous to have her mind settled on this distracting question, that she too felt disappointed. Mr. Wiseman saw, from the Doctor's preparation of books, manuscripts, notes, etc., etc., that he had made himself as strong in the affirmative of the proposition as it was possible for him to do. That whatever arguments from ecclesiastical history, from deductive reasoning, from ;inference and analogy, had ever been produced in favor of infant baptism, he had mastered and set in order for the occasion. Like a wise king, he had counted the cost. Could he have stolen into that midnight study night after   The Discussion.         193 night for the last week, and seen the anxious searchings, through all the works bearing on the points in dispute, and the assiduity in collecting and writing down the strongest arguments, he would have realized that his opponent was as fully prepared for the contest as it was possible to be. There was much, very much, at stake. This, Dr. Cheney deeply felt. It was not mere dispute for individual victory, but the investigation of a subject which involved vital inter- ests to many. The out-crop of discontent-the growing influence of Baptist principles, under the sound theology and attractive preaching of Dr. Eaton-the seeming stagna- tion among the Episcopalians-the influence of the Vernon family, which, coming from their long residence in the community, and the very respectable position occupied by Mr. Vernon-and which influence was now to be either strengthened in favor of "c the church," or drawn from it, as they should be affected by the discussion-all these consid- erations combined, produced a powerful incentive to him to make the best presentation of the arguments in favor of the doctrine of infant baptism that could be set forth. Anxiously he had entered upon the work-most anxiously had he pursued it through the past week, day and night, and now he felt an intense desire to exhibit his clear and con- vincing views, with their strong presumptive proof; and he could but illy brook the disappointment he was called upon to experience in the sudden summons, which he dared not disregard. In addition to all other considerations, he fully estimated the very great advantage which would be secured to the cause of the church," could he but make a convert of Mr. Wiseman, whose influence was now felt in all the best classes of society. This consummation most devoutly to be desired he did not sanguinely expect, yt he deemed it possible. 12     194  E, Svangel      WIseman. The Doctor argued, that if Mr. Wiseman could not be proselyted to the right, Evangel could. Of this he enter- tained no doubt. He felt himself fully competent so to present the subject, and to back it up with arguments and authorities, that she would be driven to recant her views and return to the faith in which she had been reared. This effected, he trusted that through his wife's interces- sions, Mr. Wiseman might be so influenced as to acquiesce in permitting the babe to be baptized. This gained, the victory was achieved, and would go very far to counteract -the evil of her former defection, and that of Mrs. Minden and Mrs. Gregory. In order to accomplish this point with Evangel, he was ; determined to bring before her mind, and to deeply impress '! upon it, the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, as one  taught by the Scriptures, and believed in and enforced by 8 the Church; one which had been and was now held by all classes of Christians. He would show there was no hope for children who had died unbaptized. He fully realized that this view must give her untold anguish, as it con- demned her precious dead to everlasting banishment from the presence of God: but it was necessary to be done, and he must do it. ' "Is not this the doctrine of the Church?" he asked himself, " then why should I hesitate to declare it boldly? Has it not been taught through all ages, from the times of the apostles to the present? Did not the Scriptures expressly set it forth? The word of God declares, 'The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the. unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean, but now  are they holy.' I dare not withhold the truth, though it pierce her soul through with many arrows. We must sometimes afefict   The Discussion .        195 that good may result." So argued the Doctor, as he sat in his easy chair, clad in slippers and gown, snmmning up the whole matter. He knew that to prove the doctrine of baptismal regen- eration to- Evangel's mind, was to secure the baptism of Vernon. If he could do no more than strongly to excite her fears, which should be exercised without relief,' it would as completely accomplish the desired en-l as would honest conviction. How many instances have been wit- nessed, where the love of the mother and her anxiety for the salvation of her child, have led her to override her reasonable conclusions, and through her emotion to demand this rite for her child, while she- sought refuge in that popular delusion, "If it did no good it could do no harm"? Shameful priest-craft I Fearful mockery of the great plan of redemption which cost the life, of our Lord and Master to secure for all, both adults and children, and the power of the Holy Spirit to apply, that sinners, whether adults or children may be saved I If "baptized" infants are saved, " unbaptized" infants are saved also. "Baptism" has nothing to do withtheir salvation. The word of God nowhere teaches baptismal regeneration for any one, either child or adult. It teaches expressly, in every instance, that believers are to be bap- tized, and as it is impossible for infants to believe, it is a work of supererogation to baptize them. Well may we ask of those who practice it, "Who hath required this at your hands?" Christ has never made the salvation of any human being dependent on any rite. He. has never deputed this great work of regeneration to any agent but the Holy Spirit. "Not by word nor by might, but by my Spirit, saith the       196       Evangel Wiseman. Lord." The word of God teaches faith, then baptism. No feith, no baptism. Children cannot exercise faith, there- fore they shall not be baptized. They are saved through the atonement of Christ-how applied, the word of God does not reveal.                     Many who have heard the Gospel and been baptized will go down to eternal death, because Christ was not  I by faith the end of the law to them. And many who    I have never been baptized, among whom will be the children of every age and clime, who died in unconscious infancy, ' will enter in through the gates into the city and be made inheritors of eternal life. All who are begotten by the Holy Spirit shall be saved. Those who are not shall be lost, though baptized a thousand times, and though par- takers of the Lord's Supper weekly. How sad it is that men will deceive themselves and go down to endless misery, vainly endeavoring to save themselves, instead of coming to Christ to be saved, and pointing others to the Lamb of God, who alone can take away sin I After Dr. Cheney's departure, the subject was not pur- sued farther. No one present seemed willing to approach X a question fraught with such momentous consequences.   X Miss Delia did venture-to remark, as they sat together in the parlor, "I am sorry that the Doctor had to leave just as we were beginning to be sO interested. I know Herbert, that you would have been convinced; I saw the Doctor was full of the truth, and prepared to show it con- X clusively to you. But," she added, after a few moment's  pause, during which no one offered a reply to her remark, Hi "he has gone to perform a glorious work,--the introduc- /! tion of an immortal spirit into the kingdom of the blessed 1 Saviour. This -doctrine of baptismal regeneration, which -    Th e Discussion.         197 the Church so clearly teaches, is a most glorious doctrine. No one need ever be lost. It only requires compliance with the command of Christ." "Do you really think, aunt Delia," asked Mr. Wiseman with unwonted warmth, " that God has made the eternal salvation of an immortal soul contingent on the rite of baptism?"           { "- Assuredly I do, Herbert. So do all sensible people. Didn't Dr. Cheney say sol Doesn't the Church say so? And the Bible clearly teaches the same thing. Do ,you think, Herbert, that all the people in the world are wrong, and only you Baptists right? It does seem to me presump- tuous for you to talk so, when you very well know that all the good people, from Christ's time down to this very day, have believed this blessed truth." 1"But, aunt Delia, does the Bible teach it?" "Certainly it does. Didn't you just hear me say so? Nobody disputes this but'you Baptists, and mercy knows where you sprung from  I am sure I cannot tell l" "It is very easy to assert that the Bible teaches it, aunty, but perhaps hard to prove. It is true that we Baptists deny the doctrine-oppose it wherever advocated, because we believe it saps the very foundation of vital religion by substituting a rite for the atoning blood of Christ, As to our origin, I fear you will never give yourself the trouble to trace it out. But we won't discuss that point now, and as regards our fewness compared to the multitudes that believe in your dogma, let me answer you in the words -  of Dr. Watts: "'Broad is the road that -leads to death, And thousands walk together there; But wisdom shows a narrow path, With here and there a traveler.) E            ;     '^     198       Evangel Wiseman. "We Baptists are the here and there traveler, but we are in the narrow path of wisdom. Straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to eternal life, andfew there be that find it." "Mr. Wiseman, I shall not attempt to argue with you," replied Miss Delia, as she sprang from her chair, and ! walked rapidly to the front widow, and then back again  I to the sofa. I see you are not to be convinced. But just I wait until to-morrow night. When Dr. Cheney lays his   , strong arguments before you, you'll not be able to answer , one of a thousand. You'll not dare to treat him as you do my poor feeble efforts, quote poetry and ridicule the Scrip- tares. You'll be silenced then. You can have the laugh  all to yourself, to-night. I shall go up-stairs and attend to Vernon, land keep him well for the baptism. Do you/ know our arrangements are all made, and we -are only waiting for Dr. Cheney to set you straight? Good-night, sir." And Miss Delia, with an air of felt triumph, swept out of the room, and ran up the stairway. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon soon left to rest, that they might the better be prepared for the discussion the following "Girls," said Mr. Wiseman to Annie and Lilly, as they were walking the verandah, discussing the pattern of the I robe to be made the next day, "I have a bit of pleasing intelligence for you. Our friend, Mr. Carlton, will be with  us in a  few days. So prepare yourselves to make his time I as agreeable as possible, and if either of you can make a I conquest of him, you will do well, and have my consent." With this remark, Mr. Wiseman ascended to his library. The wee small hours of the morning found these two    I young, imaginative beings discussing the grave events   before them-the arrival of Mr. Carlton-the baptism of  e the baby--and the meeting to be held by Mr. Earle.    The Discussion.         199 Could they have looked with unclouded eye into their future, how would they have wondered and shrunk back from its revealings! I "Thus ever we tread onward toward the unknown. To weal or to Ooe, by our destiny borne." Mr. Wiseman sought Evangers room, and informing her he would pass some hours in his library, requested her to retire early. Then kissing her good-night, he sought his books. And there, hour after hour, he sat reading and making notes, until he had reduced the whole subject of infant baptism to form. He had make out his brief in full. Evangel retired, but not to sleep. The soft moonlight, broken into silvery sheen by the waving boughs, fell in :  r silent beauty over the couch where she lay. Her babe reposed beside her,--an immortal soul intrusted to her feeble care. She gazed on it with all- the intensity of a mother's heart. And as she gazed she wept--wept tears of bitterness and self-reproach, and resolved that, let whatever might be the consequence, she would do what God required of her, even to the laying down of her life. "How  can I, how dare I neglect anything that will bring this undying spirit within the pale of God's forgiv- ing mercy and the love of God the Father  Only let him be saved, my precious child, O tFather and I am willing to do whatsoever thou requirest. I will give up every earthly good, even the respect of my dear, dear husband, to secure the eternal safety of this immortal I   being that Thou hast given to my care." Fearful resolve,-but just. The salvation of an immor- tal soul is far beyond and above all earthly considera- tions. "If baptismal regeneration is taught in God's word,"     200       Evangel Wiseman. she said to herself, as she continued to gaze and weep,- "if those alone are saved who are baptized, and those who are not baptized are lost, I must do my duty to this child though the whole world oppose." Deep horror thrilled her inmost soul as she repeated these words to herself. Her heart ceased its beatings,  i a cold perspiration gathered over her, and a sinking of soul, never before experienced, seized her as the weight of this question of baptismal regeneration hung itself, like a mill stone about her being. It was a dark moment for the tried mother. "The powers of hell got hold on her." She fell prostrate and lay motionless, unable to think. Could she but have heard the voice of Jesus saying, "Fear not, I am with thee. I will save. None  shall pluck them out of my hand," how would her wild heart-throbbings have been stilled, and the legions of tor- . menting fears driven from her possessed bosom by the voice of the Son of Man I In arousing to consciousness, her first impulse was to seek her husband, and tell him all her woe. She arose, and hastily throwing on her dressing gown, she noise- lessly sought the library. The door was closed-she     paused,-placed her hand on the knob,-but she did not     enter,--she dared not. How could she disturb him with her troubles, her unfounded fears? Breathlessly she list- ened, as the notes of his voice met her ear. He was praying. "Lead us, O Father, into all truth, by thy Holy Spirit " The tone of deep supplication touched her heart, and subdued its painful pulsings. The prayer had gone up before the throne. God heard and answered. "At the beginning of thy supplications," said Gabriel to Daniel in Babylon, '"the commandment   201 The Discussion.        201 came forth, and I am come now to show thee.* If then, why not now? Oh, that men would always pray, and not faint! Is not our Father "more ready to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than earthly parents are to give good gifts unto their children?" "Only believe," says the Lord Jesus, "Come unto me and I will give you rest." But men will not, believe-men will not come, and they enter not in because of their unbelief. Noth. ing but their own unsubdued wills debars them from the possession of "that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory." "And I will pray too," said the wife, as the earnest petition of her husband sunk into her soul. "I, too, will go to my Father, in this my deep anguish, and pour out my burdened soul before Him. He will hear my prayer. He will give me light. He will speak peace unto my bursting heart, for he knows that I desire above all things to do that which is pleasing in His sight. I only ask that He may be glorified, and my child--my children, my children saved I She glided back to her room, and bowing beside the bed, whereon lay her babe sleeping in its innocent beauty, she poured out her soul to God. Her supplication was for wisdom to know His will, and strength to do it. Her plaintive utterances were broken by sobs-her whole frame convulsed with the deep throes of her oppressed soul. She wrestled like the patriarch in the night watches, when no eye beheld save that of the Jehovah-Angel. Is it not true that, in all the ages, every child of God goes up through much tribulation? There are hours in the life of every individual soul, when it must be alone with *Dan. 9: 23. .. . .     202       Evangel Wiseman. God-when it must realize in the depths of its eternal being that no eye can pity, no arm save but that of the Son of God, the Jehovah-Angel, who was made flesh and dwelt with men. And oh I how oftentimes these midnight hours, and these strong cryings and tears, become to our souls the Mount of Transfiguration and the voice of God And from the depths of sorrow and the blackness of despair, the. Saviour sweetly lifts us up to sit with Him in heavenly places, and feeds our souls on the hidden manna. Only through s'tffering are we purified. Sublime truth I "The thorn in the flesh " to them who are unsanctified, but the " easy yoke " and the " light burden" to all who can say -"Thy will, not mine." It is God's way-His own -"appointed means. "The servant is not better than his master," nor the disciple than his Lord. Our Saviour,  "though a son," the well-beloved Son of God, "learned obedience of the things which He suffered." And shall not we?  When will the people of the Most High lay to heart this great and glorious truth-that there is a needs be that  they suffer, in order that they may reign,-must learn to bear with patience the light afflictions, in whatever form they may come, knowing that whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and if we are without chastening, we are bastards and not sons. Evangel rose from the depths of this fbarful struggle calm and comforted. The full dawn of the morning light was not yet hers, but a sweet peace stole into her soul. The Holy Spirit took possession of her heart. Her agita- tions were all stilled, and stayed on the Lord God Jehovah she felt no fear. The evil one forsook her, no longer daring to ply her with his fearful machinations.   203 The Discusston.        2 How sweet and sure the relief of prayer!

CHAPTER Xm. PRELIMARIES-DISCUSSION. AD^R. CHEEY did not come to tea on Friday evening, as was expected by the anxious friends. But just as the family were rising from the table, around which various suggestions and fears had been expressed, the door-bell rang, and he was ushered into the parlor. Everything had been arranged by Lilly and Annie, as on the night before. The table was in the same position, the lamps so placed as to throw a beautiful light on the pleasant - group. Dr. Cheney's books and manuscripts had been laid beside his seat at the head, so as to be readily available. The young girls were greatly interested in the discussion about to take place, but for the life of them they could not tell which side they wished to triumph. , Firm Episcopali- ans were they, and loved Dr. Cheney dearly, but chey had a wonderful respect for Mr. Wiseman and his opinions- and moreover they thought to themselves, of course, that perhaps Mr. Carlton was a Baptist. And now that they knew Dr. and Mrs. Eaton, and Fannie Eaton, and also several other members of Dr. Eaton's church, whom they had met at the pic-nic a few days before, they began to realize that Baptists were, after all, quite a respectable and intelligent people to be sure. Like thousands of others, the girls had been the victims of prejudice and ignorance themselves. They had con- demned those of whom they had known absolutely nothing. How often this is the case I We view every landscape by our own horizon. Like the mite on the leaf, we think our   Preliminaries-Discussion.       205 world is all the world. What Pharisees half the professed Christians are I thanking God that they are not as other men, not realizing that they themselves are halt, and lame, and blind, and leprous. Their religion is one of succession, a few points on which they stick and writhe, knowing nothing of the broad, deep love of God, which embraces all who embrace the Master and walk in His divine ways. Let us all stand close beside the, Cross, and list the voice of Him who cries: "Come unto me, all ye ends of the earth, and be ye saved." "Girls;" said Miss Delia, who was superintending the arrangement of the parlor, " you must place fresh flowers 6 in all the vases, and put the large arm-chair just here, rather to the left of the fire-place, and into it a good soft pillow." ,' For what, aunty?" asked Lilly, surprised. "To lay the baby in. I am determined he shall be present. Do just as I tell you, and put this stand to one side, with its beautiful vase of flowers and a pitcher of water ." The girls looked significantly at each other and smiled, but forbore further questionings. Anna arranged the flowers, and Lilly the chair, and as she placed. the Sevres pitcher on the little stand, called to Miss Vernon to see if everything was to her taste. "All right, girls; just as I would have it." "But, aunty, Bridget Mahoney can attend to Vernon," suggested Lilly. "Not one word, Lilly; I shall have my own way in this." Whether or not Miss Vernon thought the babe would plead in behalf of the "glorious doctrine of baptismal     206     i Evangel Wiseman. regeneration," or would be edified by the discussion, she- did not divulge. But down the little fellow had to come. She tucked him away on the huge pillow in the arm-chair and placed the chair where her eye could rest upon it. After bidding the Doctor good evening, and conducting him to his position at the head of the table, Mr. Wiseman ran up to his library and brought down his books and manuscripts, aud laid them on a stand beside him. In the interim, Miss Delia, eager to know whether an / immortal-being had been made an inheritor of the king- " dom of heaven, asked, "Did you baptize the baby last   evening, Doctor?"       -  "It was not a baby, Miss Delia," replied the Doctor, most complacently, as he drew forth his handkerchief and wiped his mouth, after supping the fragrant tea, which Bridget Mahoney had prepared for him herself, because she wished to do something for the 'good praste,' as she called him--"not a baby at all, Miss Delia, but a  boy full six years old." "Why, how did this happen, Doctor?    His parents communicants of the church, and left him unbaptized so long! What strange people there are in the world now- a-days!"And she involuntarily tured a full, square look first on Herbert, who was arranging his literary weapons, and then on Evangel. "No, no, his parents are not church communicants., I find on inquiring, that Mr. Nesbitt is what we style a Campbellite, and the mother a Baptist, though raised an Episcopalian." "Why, Doctor, how did it occur that they should send for you to baptize their child? asked Mr. Vernon, aroused by the singular statement of the Doctor. "Is this not a peculiar case?"   Preliminaries-Discussion.      207 a Very, indeed, sir,--very; in all my ministry I have never met just such a one. I can only account for- it by supposing that the old doctrines of the Church, that the mother learned in her childhood, must have come to her mind in her sorrow, for she believes the child must die very soon. And another thing, the friends who watched with her, Mr. and Mrs. Seyfert, are members of our church. You know them both, and doubtless they suggested it." "Campbellism is no bulwark against infant baptism, as you are aware, Doctor. they hold and advocate bap- tism for the remission of sins. They, like yourself, believe in baptismal regeneration. The founder of the sect, Alex- ander Campbell, has said repeatedly in his writings, that "'baptism and regeneration are synonymous terms." You know-he came to this country a Scotch Presbyterian, and I think he never forgot the teachings of Calvin and Knox. If baptism be regeneration, then why, should not infants be baptized? You see the transition is easy. As to the mother of the child, she is no Baptist, whatever her pro- fession may be. I am sure she is not identified with our church in membership, and she should not claim to be a Baptist, if she could under any circumstances have her child sprinkled. Baptists never permit such a thing done. Never, never!" Mr. Wiseman spoke with emphasis. He felt it his duty to place the affair inits proper light. He had no acquaint- ance with the Nesbitts, but he knew well that the mother was no Baptist, whatever she was supposed to be. His fervor surprised all present. His language did not - sound to Dr. Cheney very much as, if " he wished to be convinced."' Indeed the Doctor felt that Mr. WFseman was not to be enlightened. He appeared as a man who     208      SEvangel Wiseman. had- thoroughly weighed the whole question, and had   : effectually and unchangeably made up his mind on every point. His hopes for the baptism of Vernon were rested upon the influence he could make tell upon the mind of Evan-  gel, and the other members of the family, and through them, on Mr. Wiseman. Poor EvangelI All the terrors of the past night returned. She felt the significance of her husband's words, even  :! more deeply than did Doctor Cheney. She was confident  [ in her own mind that her husband's opinions were stead- i' fast. But -then if Dr. Cheney could prove baptismal regeneration, or the duty of infant baptism, she must  i have her babe receive the rite, even though she incur the t  displeasure of Herbert, and bring reproach upon the cause , he loved. Thus step by step she had been led on, through  love to her child and the influence of early prejudices, - from an .entire rejection of the doctrine, to a determina- 1 tion almost fixed, to have the child baptized. "For surely : there must be a command for it, or it would not have been  oe long gnd extensively practiced. Could Dr. Cheney    3 prove that in baptism the soul was regenerated, then the ! child should be baptized, for Vernon should be saved if  ! it were in the power of any rite to do it." Could Dr. Cheney have read her soul as she sat there trembling in her seat, he would have 'deemed- her an easy prey. But he knew not that the citadel had been stormed and almost taken. Had Mr. Wiseman under- stood her feelings, he would have moved directly to the attack upon these two strongholds, and not allowed the discussion to elaborate itself as it did. Dr. Cheney saw he must bend his bow so as to make his arrows pierce the- very soul of Evangel, and thus con-  .' -- -   Preliminaries-Discussion.      209 { vince her of the necessity of the child's baptism. He understood on which horn of the dilemma he must hang his" victim, and he determined to do it; so turning over his notes very nonchalantly, while his heart rather mis- gave him, he remarked very coolly: "Well, I believe we established the doctrine of baptismal regeneration last evening, beyond the shadow of a doubt." The Doctor paused tosee how this assertion would be received. Mr. Wiseman did not reply, waiting for the Doctor to append some remark. Evangel sat transfixed, her eyes resting on that pile of books and papers. Her senses swam. The decision had been reached. Vernon '  should be baptized-the consequences-oh! she dared not face theml In that minute she lived a lifetime. Did not the Father look down and pity His tried child? - "And now," said the Doctor, with a feeling of satisfied gi  triumph, "let us proceed to our second point, and-" "Allow me, Doctor, to remark," interrupted Mr. Wise- man, " that I do not feel the first proposition at all proved. You were showing last evening, that it had always been the doctrine of the Pedo-Baptist denominations, but you did not have time to prove this, and when this point is substan- tiated,-if indeed it can be,--it will still remain for you to show that the word of God teaches it. Our final appeal in all matters pertaining to doctrine, must of necessity be to the ' law and the testimony.'  The Doctor was taken aback. The sea was already rough. Fearful breakers ahead, Doctor! Look out, lest the anathemas due those that have departed from the faith fall on your own head. Evangel experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling; the burden was partially lifted from her soul. She breathed more freely. 13     e   Evangel Wiseman.   210   Preliminaries-Discussion .   2"   "Did I not show that this vital doctrine had always been held by the Church, Mr. Wiseman?" asked the Doc- tor pleasantly. "By no means, Doctor. You had quoted a few author- ities on this point, not sufficient to establish it, even as a doctrine of Pedoism. Let us, if you please, first sub- ,stantiate this proposition,-that is, if -we can,-before proceeding further. I think, on investigation, you will find there is a great contrariety of opinion in your own ranks, sufficient to show fully that it is not a doctrine of Pedo-Baptist denominations. Miss Vernon looked uneasily around, first at the baby and then at the girls. "I have here, Mr. Wiseman," and the Doctor took from his coat-pocket a book, from which, as he did so, fell two closely-written pages of notes. "I have here a work in which there are given all the authorities on this point; I will read from it.^" The Doctor had come prepared on this head. But he had / hoped Mr. Wiseman would take for granted that it had ever been, at the least, the doctrine of the Church. This would necessarily give it great weight to the minds of those who listened, and would make much in favor of his side of the argument when it came to be tested by the Scriptures. But Mr. Wiseman was not disposed to take anything for granted; every step must be clearly proved before he would proceed to the consideration of another. "Read, Doctor, if you please," he said. Let us have all the testimony in favor of your proposition,-that is, that the doctrine of baptismal regeneration has always been held by the various Pedo-Baptist denominations." "I would not be understood, Mr. Wisenian, to undertake to prove that it has always been held by all Pedo-Bap- tists, said the Doctor rather hesitatingly   "But they have all sprinkled infants, have they not, Doctor?" "Yes, sir; they have all baptized infants." "And yet all did not have the same object in the adminis- tration of the rite; and that, too, when you assure me that this has been the doctrine of the various Pedo-Baptist denominations through all time, and is the doctrine of the Bible. It is true, then, in the outset of our discussion, that reverend Doctors of Divinity will differ among them- selves with regard to the design of an ordinance that they all find is taught in the Scriptures and practiced in their churches. But please proceed with your proof from eccles- iastical history, and if we cannot agree on this testimony, then we will see what the word of God says." "Well, then, Mr. Wiseman, we will begin with the third century. Origen, one of the Fathers of this period, you are aware, says expressly: ' None is free from pollution, though his life be but the length of one day upon the earth; and it is for that reason, because by the sacrament of baptism the pollution of our birth is taken away, that infants are baptized.'" "But, Doctor, just here let me ask you, if you please, why you begin so late in the third century to establish this doctrine?" "Because, Mr. Wiseman, we have no reliable church history on this point prior to that period, though we con- cede it was taught by the Fathers, because it is in itself a necessity." "But let me again ask, does not Origen state, in this very connection, that, ' I will mention a thing which causes frequent inquiries among the brethren.' Here we learn from his own words, that this doctrine of baptism for the forgiveness of sins caused frequent inquiries. Certainly   212       Evangel Wiseman. then it could not have been universally received. There must have been some who were in doubt, at least. This is the state of the doctrine as late as the third century. But proceed, if you please." "Basil, who lived in the fourth century, and was one of the Fathers, says on this point: 'Baptism is the soul regenerated.' Ambrose, of the same century, says: 'Who regenerated thee of the water and the Holy Spirit?' Chrysostom: 'Baptism is the cleansing of the sins by the Holy Spirit.' And Augustine is more explicit, still, when he affirms that baptism washes the body and signifies what is done in the soul. And, again: Whosoever is carnally born of this disobedience of the flesh, the law of sin and death, must be spiritually born again, that he may not only be introduced into the kingdom of God, but also be freed from the condemnation of sin. They are, therefore, as truly born in the flesh, subject to the sin and death of the first man, as they are regenerated in baptism to a connec- tion with the righteousness and eternal life of the other man. By baptism, the chain of guilt is broken by which the devil held the soul; and the partition is broken down by which he separated man from his Maker.'  "Pretty strong language, Mr. Wiseman," remarked the Doctor. "Very strong, indeed, Doctor. Too strong for any man to use on his own authority. I find in your quotations that none of the Fathers ever produced the word of God, the only reliable authority in matters of doctrine in the Church of Christ, but give their own opinions, or those of others, which views may be exceedingly erroneous. Indeed, we find that many of the practices of these centu- ries you are now referring to, have been entirely repudiated by what you are pleased to denominate the church-celibacy,   Preliminaries-Discussion.   213   for instance; the practice of infant coimunion; the priest. hood, and its attendant ceremonies; also, the doctrine of transubstantiation. All these, your church looks upon as errors not to be tolerated. Might it not be that infant baptism as a practice, and baptismal regeneration as a doc- trine, are equally as unscriptural and worthy of censure, as those others which the Episcopal Church has so pointedly  neglected? And, moreover, you are aware that, in face of this doctrine, so plainly and unquivocally stated by Augus- tine, Pelagius of England and Celestius of Ireland denied original sin entirely, and held that the consequences of Adam's sin were confined to himself, and that new-born infants are in the same state that Adam was before his fall. So you see, here, Doctor, is a great difference of opinion with regard to this question of baptismal regen- eration; for if infants have no sin, as these two learned men argued, they, of course, need no regeneration, and necessarily no baptism." Dr. Cheney was a good deal discomfited by Mr. Wise- man's remarks, but he felt he must preserve a calm exte- rior and pass by as unheededly as possible all his pertinent remarks. So he did not deign a direct reply, but added: "Chrysostom says: 'But our circumcision-I mean the grace of baptism-gives cure without pain, and procures for us a thousand benefits, and fills us with the grace of the Spirit. It is lawful to any one in the very beginning of his age.' Here, you see, he teaches infant baptism and baptismal regeneration, Mr. Wiseman. And Julian, equally " learned and respected, and influential in the Church, says, in reply to Augustine: 'You see how many are the benefits of baptism. And yet some think that the heavenly grace consists only in the forgiveness of sins. But I have reck. oned up ten advantages of it. For this cause we baptize    214       Evangel. Wiseman.            J infants also, though they are not defiled with sin, that there may be superadded to them, saintship, righteousness, adop- tion, inheritance, a brotherhood with Christ, and to be made members with Him.' " "So, Doctor, here is again a difference of opinion among the Fathers. I am well aware that, if many of the old  e ecclesiastical writers believed in this doctrine of baptismal regeneration, many of them did not, as I have shown. The Catholic Church holds to it now, but do all the clergy of the Established Church of England indorse it? Do Presbyterians of England hold it? Does the Episcopal Church of America believe it? We know that Congrega- tionalists, and Presbyterians, and Methodists of the United States, will not admit it. And then the facts, as they are presented to us, show that it is not so. The sprinkling of water on a child, whatever you may say in favor of infant baptism, cannot change its heart or make it an inheritor of eternal life. How many do we see daily, who have been baptized in infancy, according to the various formulas of Pedo-Baptist denominations, who are liars, and thieves, and drunkards, and men of every vice! If these men had - regenerated hearts they could not sin thus. You, yourself, must admit that they do, not possess the Spirit of Christ, without which the' cannot be His, and yet they have been baptized according to the formulas,-many of them, of your own church." .                      e "Don't you believe in baptismal regeneration for adults, i Mr. Wiseman? I thought the Baptists did."   : "By no means, sir. We utterly repudiate the idea.   O We believe in regeneration by the Spirit of God, and in baptism as a figure of our faith, our trust in the death [ and resurrection of Christ,-the only hope of our salva- [ fion."  -                             ;    1          'Priminaries-Discussion.     215 *'But why then, Mr. Wiseman, are you such sticklers for your mode-immersion?" "Baptist phraseology, Doctor, admits of no such term as ' modes of baptism,' only as necessity requires it to adapt the argument to Pedo-Baptist views and expressions. "With us, baptism is the immersion of a believer in water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Neither pour- ing nor sprinkling is baptism to us. We say ' modes of baptism' par necessite, because of the departures of what you call the church, and Catholics call the only true church, from the plain teachings of the word of God. Your errors in practice must lead to error in terms, and so Baptists have to accommodate themselves to these wrong terms, 'modes of baptism ' and I infant baptism,' to meet you, in their defense of truth. You know, Doctor, that while Luther maintained \'that baptism is truly efficacious, and confers the adoption of the sons of God;' the Genevan Catechism, prepared by Calvin, presents this question: Do you think the water to be the laver of the soul?' The reply is, 'By no meacns; for it is impious to take this honor from the blood of Christ, which was shed that all our stains being cleansed away, it might make us pure and unpolluted before God.' And you are aware, Doctor of the fearful controversy in the Established Church of England, between the Bishop of Exeter and Rev. Mr. Gorham, who did not believe in unconditional regenera- tion of infants in baptism, on account of which the Bishop refused to institute him as Vicar of Bramford Speke, in his diocese. And you are also fully acquainted with the Tyng controversy of our day?" "Yes, yes; I know there are, and always have been, defections in the church. Some will break over all res- traints, and set at naught all her teachings to think for themselves."     216       Evangel Wiseman.               "' And has not every man, in matters of doctrine, to think i for himself, and as he conscientiouly believes, so to act? Have any set of men, calling themselves a council, synod, ? presbytery or aught else, a right to bind the conscience  X of any man by rules enacted by themselves?" "No--no, not this, Mr. Wiseman. But how can two     I walk together unless they be agreed?" "They cannot; therefore, no organization should, in the name of religion, dictate to men's consciences, or make laws for the government of Christ's people. 'He  has given in His word all that is necessary for the suc- cessful carrying on of His kingdom on earth, and teaches  5 His people that the power is His, to give doctrines, insti- tute ordinances, and lay down laws; -and He has never delegated this power to any man, or body of men. The    ^ rules laid down in Matthew are sufficient, without bulls, and canons, and decrees of councils, and rubrics, and lit- urgies, and formulas. The two ordinances which He has established,-- baptism and the Lord's Supper, - which are  a signs--not sacraments-are sufficient for all church pur-  poses.' I "Do you totally reject the doctrine of baptismal regen- eration, Mr. Wiseman? '?  "Wholly and entirely, sir. And now, Doctor, let me     ask, Do you fully indorse it?"          .    I "Haven't I shown that it has been taught by the churches in all ages? and how dare I dispute it?"  Dr. Cheney was confused, but he dared not manifest it. Evangel smiled; Miss Delia frowned; Mr. and Mrs. Ver- non were perplexed; the girls excited. Only the uncon- scious babe was unmoved. "You have not gone farther back into antiquity than the third century, and there we find it opposed as well   Preliminaries-Discussion.      217 as taught, and so down through the history of what you call the churches, until our own day, when we find divis- ions, fearful ones at that, in the Episcopal Church, and an entire repudiation of it by Congregationalists, Presby- terians, and Methodists. The latter sects would regard it as an insult to ascribe such heterodoxy to them. And now, sir, I repeat the question, Do you believe in bap- tismal regeneration? If baptism regenerates, then why is it that so many who have been baptized are unquestion- ably unregenerated,-are not inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, but are undeniably the children of hell?"  Mr. Wiseman would make short work of this fearful error, which he knew had been the greatest obstacle in the way of his wife's advance into the full light of the truth. Everything was hushed to breathless silence in the pause that intervened between this pointed question of Mr. Wiseman, and the Doctor's reply. All eyes were directed with earnest inquiry upon the advocate of baptismal regeneration, to hear what his conscience and judgment taught him, when they dared to be exercised without the jurisdiction of the dicta of the church. The Doctor hesitated; it was a trial moment to him. He dared not take the affirmative-it was opposed to all common-sense, honest conviction, sound reasoning, and would lead him into depths from which he could never hope to rescue himself. He dared not take the negative, for this would be to overthrow what he had built up-so poorly it is true--but yet he had done what he could with the material. So he found himself most fearfully perplexed, but like a true son of the church, after much hesitation, he said: "I must quote the words of Mr. Melville, in reply,     218       Evangel Wiseman.  and say, 'You may dislike the doctrine; you may wish it expelled from the Prayer-book; but so long as I officiate X according to the forms of that Prayer-book, I do not see , how I can be commonly honest, and yet deny that every baptized person is, on that account, regenerated." "Then I understand you to say, Doctor, that as a church- man, with the Prayer-book as your guide, you are cornm-  pelled to say, or do say, that you believe in the doctrine; : but that, as an individual, with the Bible alone to guide ! you, and deciding for yourself, from its teachings and  ! your own honest convictions, you do not indorse the doc- trine?"                         I. The Doctor made no answer. His friends looked at him  ? with amazement. Miss Delia scarcely kept her seat. She was almost dying to say something, but what could she  say?                           ii Evangel now began to discover how it was that good and wise men, in all ages, had been led to practice and  : preach what the Church had engrafted, without the cour-  age to speak out their own heartfelt convictions. Mr Wiseman could not press the question further. Twice he had asked it, pointedly. Each time it had been evas- ively answered. "Doctor," added Mr. Wiseman, perceiving that he could elicit nothing further in this direction by interrogato- ? ries, "if all who are baptized are regenerated, --are,  X consequently, saved,-then all who are not baptized, are unregenerated, and, consequently, lost? Do you, with Augustine, say, 'that infants dying without baptism, die without the kingdom, and must be in everlasting fire; that if the child is not delivered from the powers of the devil by baptism, that he must be with the devil in eternal fire.?,    Preliminaries-Discussion.      219 Again was Dr. Cheney posed. How legitimate was this I   deduction from the premises I How could he avoid it, and yet how dare he indorse what his church now considered I   a detestable Romish dogma I He was driven to the affirm- ative by legitimate inference, but he could not risk the assertion in the face of his intelligent hearers, nor risk his reputation in the community by having such a sentiment ascribed to him. Gladly would he have left this impression on the mind of Evangel, that it might lie there until it drove her to have the child baptized. And he had pur- posed so directing the controversy, as to lodge this conclu- sion with her, deduced from the writings of the "Fathers." But he could not assume the responsibility of asserting it for himself; so, after a long pause, in which all was again still as death, he said: "Mr. Wiseman, I cannot answer you, only by asking you how are children saved, if not by baptism?" "They are saved as all fallen human beings are saved, Dr. Cheney, through the atonement of Christ." "But do you mean, Mr. Wiseman, to say that because Christ died, all men will be saved? This is to make your- self a Universalist."  "By no means, sir. Children are not included in the gospel commission. They cannot believe, nor can any one have faith for them, therefore they are not required to be baptized, nor can they be saved through the gospel plan, since they can know nothing of it at all, not having power y  to understand the least of its requirements. But that children dying in unconscious infancy are saved, all, I presume, in this age, believe. And they must be saved through the atonement of Christ; they could not be saved without it. The Holy Spirit makes it efficacious in God's own appointed way, which He has not seen fit to reveal     220  -     Evangel Wiseman. to us, because it is something with which we cannot inter- j fere, or change, or affect, in any way. It is not, at all in X our power. The gospel is addressed to those who, can   i understand, who can accept or reject the offered mercy,  X and the declaration is, that 'he that believeth and is bap-d  tized, shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.' God has not placed it in the power of any man,   nor convocation of men, to affect in the least the salvation of any infant. He has made ample provision for the salva-  tion of all dying in unconscious infancy,; through the blood of the atonement, applied as He Himself sees fit, without any reference whatever to a connection with the gospel  . plan, addressed to the understanding and will of those who -can accept, or withstand."                j Mr. Wiseman awaited the Doctor's reply, but none was .- made. Everything was as silent as the tomb. Had Miss Delia seen a cobra de capello, she could not have worn a . more terrified look. "I can very readily see, Doctor," resumed Mr. Wiseman, after a sufficient pause, " how this practice of infant bap- tism should have so rapidly gained consideration. As soon as men were made to believe in baptismal regeneration- that there was no pardon without baptism-it could easily be shown, that if, as Augustine urged, children go to   i 'eternal fire ' if they die unbaptized, they should undergo the rite as soon as born, or even before, as the Catholic  Fathers very consistently maintain." "I was always led to suppose that the Baptists attached a great deal of importance to this ordinance, Mr. Wise- man," replied the Doctor, entirely routed from his position. "And so they do, sir. They believe that in obedience to the command ot Christ, and after His example, every believer should be baptized. Not that their sins may be   Preliminaries-Disacusson.      221 remitted thereby, but because their sins have been remitted, when by faith they have laid hold on Christ as the propi- f ation for their sins." "They do not regard it then, as a saving ordinance?" "Not at all. They hold it to be the duty of all believers because they are believers, but they know from God's word that none others have a light to it." "I should be glad, Mr. Wiseman, to discuss this point longer with you, but it is growing late; I shall have to defer it to some other time. I have an engagement at nine, imperative, and it wants but ten minutes of that time," said the Doctor, nervously consulting his watch. , But I think, sir, I can show you that while the church has differed with regard to the efficacy of baptism, she has always regarded it as an ordinance taught by the Fathers and the Scriptures." Oh, Doctor Doctor you have not yet shown Her- bert that infant sprinkling is right; don't leave until you prove this point to him. Why, this is the very thing I asked you to come for, and you have not touched upon it at all. Do not go, I beseech you, until he is convinced. Why I Vernon will never be baptized until you show him it is his duty to have it done " "I doubt, Miss Delia, if it is in my power to convince Mr. Wiseman.  The evidence is strong and conclusive, but he may not admit its force,-" "Let me interrupt you, Doctor, by saying that I shall be most glad to hear all your arguments, and weigh all your testimony in favor of this time-honored custom, and am ever open to conviction. I shall be most happy to have the whole testimony in favor of this extended practice, set before mal at an early date. It may have much more in its" favor much more that is convincing, than this     222       Evangel Wiseman. doctrine of baptismal regeneration. If the practice is founded on the doctrine we have been arguing to-night, it must fall to the ground; but it may have better support; A if so, I shall be glad to know it. Whatever is duty, that  I desire to do." i?'  "Oh, Doctor, dQcome one evening next week-say Tuesday, and convinch Herbert on this point, for every- ! thing is ready f*Vernon to be baptized," interposed  Miss Delia most 4beseechingly. "Yes, Doctor," urged Evangel, whose soul, relieved of its crushing weight, was filled with peace and joy. "Yes, Doctor, do come, as Aunt Delia has suggested, on Tuesday of next week, and if possible show Mr. Wiseman his duty in this matter. I am so anxious to hear what can be said for and against this practice, so zealously advocated by some, and so unsparingly depre- cated by others. It has always been so strange to me to see Christians differ so widely." ' This practice, so honored int he Church, and so uni- versally adhered to, does not depend on the doctrine that we have been discussing to-night, Mr. Wiseman," added the Doctor with great emphasis, "but on authority eccle- siastical and divine, which cannot, I think, be set aside. And with all due respect to Mr. Wiseman's contrary opin- S ion, I must say that I think it can be, shown that it is . the imperative duty, according to command and example, for every Christian parent to have his child baptized." " It was decided, then, that on Tuesday evening the Doctor should return to the investigation of the subject,-  not whether baptized infants were saved and unbaptized ones lost,--but the duty of Christian parents to have their children baptized. Hastily bidding them good evening, the Doctor took up his hat to leave. 'Miss Delia followed   Preliminaries-Discussion,      223 him to the gate, urging him by all means to make his next point very strong. "He must be convinced, Doctor, or it will be of no avail." Miss Vernon was disappointed in the result of the inter- view. Evangel's mind was relieved forever on the subject of baptismal regeneration.  The light she had received, had dispelled all doubts on this point. Her babe was not lost because it had not been baptized. Angels had borne it to the .home of the redeemed, because Christ had pur- chased it by His blood, even though no water had been sprinkled on it, and no formula of words pronounced over it. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon had never believed in this fearful doctrine. Indeed, the Church only taught it in Prayer- book and creed. .And as to Lilly and Annie, they did not particularly understand the question anyhow. They wanted all the babies baptized, because they had been taught by the Church that it should be done, and had always seen it practiced, but as to what it was for, whether ,: for salvation or church membership, to obey what the church taught, or to show off fine clothes, they could not exactly say. Miss Delia alone, of all the company, retired with a heavy heart. Surely the Doctor had failed to prove his point. What if he should do so again?     224       Evangel Wiseman. * CHAPTER XIV.               I IMMEDIATE RESULTS--LET US LOOK AT THEMo       \ 0O with us, then, to the study of Rev. Dr. Cheney.   S T -See him there, at the midnight hour, his books strewn around him, sitting beside that same little table at which Miss Delia found him, when she went on her important mission. His head rests on his hand, his face wears a look of weary anxiety,--fearfully painful- as indicated by the knitted brow and compressed lips. His hair falls neglected over his right temple, while his right hand grasps earnestly Wall's History of Infant Bap- ; tism. The open Bible and Prayer-book lie before him. It is evident the Doctor has been studying,- studying to entrench himself in his positions; getting all the author- : ity possible, from history, Prayer-book and Bible. And  r now he is thinking and planning how to bring all his power to bear on his adversary for his complete over- throw. But how can this be done? He is conscious that the night's argument, as well as that of the previous  ? evening, has gone against him, leaving him for the present hors de combat; and he is nervous, --decidedly so,-as  i to the effect of the discussion upon the minds of those who were present. Like a skillful general, he is considering not only his own resources, entrenching and fortifying himself, but is just as assiduously viewing the force and tactics of his opponent. He is regarding, also, the results, immediate and remote, and endeavoring as far as possible, to provide for them. He feels that his anticipations, thus far, have   Immediate Results--Let us Look at Them.   225 been sadly disappointed. He must admit, at least, a par- tial defeat. This must be retrieved, if possible, -and then, too, he must advance. How shall this be done? Re- treat he will not, but maintain his ground at all haz- ards. Could not his opponent be dislodged? Sadly he realizes that his most spirited attacks and adroit maneu- vres have been met and thwarted; and despite his reso- lution, energy and activity, his enemy occupies the vantage ground. All this is humiliating, and must be retrieved. Another attempt must be made, a sortie which should surprise and rout the enemy. "But how?"  This is the i 11  question as yet unanswered, and unanswerable. Fair fight according to the general rules of controversy, he is con- /   vinced, will be of no avail. His opponent is strong, well fortified at every point, clear-headed, quick, and resolute. ss::g Skillful generalship alone can succeed. He cannot longer X   'follow the rules of a martinet. XH   The Doctor scratches his head energetically, and we hear him say to himself, "Have I not rather lost, than gained thus far?"We think you have, Doctor, most decidedly. "What impression," he repeats slowly to himself, " has to-night's discussion left on the minds of those present?" Not a favorable one for "infant baptism," we opine, Doctor.  Miss Delia is- not shaken in the truth,' we hear him say, soliloquizing. "OhI no, she will remain steadfast, what- ever may occur. Rooted and grounded in the faith, she cannot be moved. But then Mr. and Mrs. Vernon and the young ladies, how are they affected? What are their views, I should like to know?" 'Be patient, Doctor I Yet a little while, and you shall know them -" by their fruits." Chagrined, disappointed, mortified, doubting, puzzled, " ;-    '      ZZo      ffvanget wzseman s irresolute, he sits in his study, with his books around him, while the hands of the mantel-clock point to half past twelve. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon walked home silent and thoughtful. Each understood the other as well as if thought had been expressed in words. They both felt that infant baptism did not, after all, rest on an impregnable foundation. It was, indeed, quite questionable. They wondered that in all their life, they had never before heard counter argu- ments. But why should they wonder, when they had never before placed themselves within the pale of any influence not sanctioned by the Church? But whatever were their questionings, whatever their doubts, they would not change their church relationship. Their ancestors had lived and died members of the established church, and they would do so too. Nothing could be jeopardized   , thereby, and they were too far advanced in life to be making changes where nothing could be gained. Thus they silently reasoned to themselves, and the question was left just there in the mind of each. Shall no future event lead to a different decision? We shall see I Mr. Wiseman knew the advantage he had gained, so he  r rested secure in the strength of the right. He felt assured : that the Doctor could make no better argument for divine authority, than he had made for ecclesiastical authority. Yet he deemed it his imperative duty to strengthen himself  as fully as he could. So, after the Doctor left, he too : betook himself to his library, and the midnight hour found him amid his books, with open Bible before him, and Gayle,  Carson, Hinton, Howell, Noel, and other writers outspread  around him. When the contestants meet again, each will come to the conflict as armed men prepared for the battle.   -Immediate Results-Let us Look at Them.   227 Evangel, after pouring out her soul in grateful thanks to God, that He had in His own good time, and through such means as He Himself had chosen, brought peace to her troubled mind on that point of all others to her the most vital--baptismal regeneration- now slept sweetly, her precious babe beside her. She realized that the little one gone before was safe; saved by the atoning blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, it was sheltered in the loving Saviour's bosom, without its destiny being in the least affected by aught men could do. No storm could reach it now. No more sickness, nor pain, nor death for it; but secure and joyous it should ever be, and she should see him again. Tears of thanksgiving flowed down her cheeks, and for the first time since that dreadful night of torture, when her child had closed its eyes in death, did she cheerfully say, "Thy will be done I The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." What a stage in her earthly pilgrimage had she made that night! What a mountain summit gained I Wlat an Eben- ezer did she raisel Thus the Lord leadeth His children on heavenward! Blessed mother! so young, so loving, so trusting, so believing!' Angels watch over thee and thy precious charge! And thou shalt be led onward and upward, pro- tected and defended by these unseen guardians, and enlight- ened and strengthened by the Holy Spirit, until, the Jordan crossed, thou shalt " enter through the gates into the city, whose maker and builder is God, and be forever at rest, seeing even as thou art seen, and knowing as thou art known," and realizing, in the ecstacy of joy, that all these light afflictions were working out the " far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."     226       Evangel Wiseman.  "'Well, I do declare, Annie," said Lilly Vernon to her  friend Annie Chiles, as the two were preparing to retire, ; "I had no thought tha tthere could be such a strong argu- ment made against infant baptism. I had always been   : taught that all who opposed it were prejudiced and igno- rant, and their opposition had root in these, and not in S reason. But it does seem to me, brother Herbert corn- pletely defeated Dr. Cheney- to-night. And I tell you I am j so rejoiced that he did! Oh, Annie, you cannot tell how miserable sister has been, ever since she has been made to v s believe that dear little Herbert might be lost, because he  was not baptized. But I know her mind is at rest now on  this point, for brother showed conclusively that a child does s  not need baptism that it may be saved."     . "Yes, I see, Lilly, that whatever importance may attach to baptism, it cannot save the soul. How glad Mrs. Wise- : man must be! She had been so sad, so very sad, ever since her babe died; and I do expect this may have been the cause of her deep distress. I did not know what .it was, but I have observed that she has been deeply afflicted."  "Oh, it has been this: Aunt Delia believes in baptismal  regeneration as taught in our Prayer-book, and she has . , several times, in my presence, intimated that our darling X Herbert was lost, because they did not have him baptized. And I know that sister has feared it, although she has  never said one word to me on the subject. But we can see  now, and so clearly too, that children are saved without baptism. Even aunty must be convinced, if it were pos-  sible to convince her that anything could be right, but what - our Prayer-book teaches. I do wish she would not be so . incorrigible. But she is a perfect devotee to her opinions' I  know she does not credit one word of what brother Herbert said, and this very moment as much believes that our little i darling is not ill heaven, as she ever did."   Immediate Results-Let us Look at Them.   229 "Well, Lilly, isn't it strange-it seems so strange to me- that this should have been the practice of the churches, for so long a time, in all ages, and in all countries, if it is not right?' No people but the Baptists ever opposed it." "Oh, Annie, I think it is right; but then I do not believe the salvation of the soul depends upon it. No doubt the Bible enjoins it as a duty, and teaches it by example, and all Christian people should hlave their children baptized, for you know that if it does no good, it cannot possibly do any harm. And then it is such a beautiful and impressive sight!        . "I once heard Mrs. Wiseman ,say, Lilly, that Mr. Wise- man believes infant baptism does a great deal of harm. He believes it deceives persons, and makes them attach that importance to a rite that should be given only to a change of heart by the Spirit of God. I believe this is what she said."  " Oh, well, that, of course, is brother's Baptist viewl " replied Lilly, as she let fall her wealth of nut-brown hair over her pretty shoulders. "We all know it must be enjoined in the Bible. All the good people, but the Bap- tists, have believed in it, and practiced it. And surely, everybody has not been wrong and they right I " '"Don't you think- the Bible teaches it, Annie?" asked Lilly, after a moment's pause. She looked earnestly into the eyes of her young friend, who sat to her left, undoing fi. the gaiter-string, which, in her interest in the question before them, she had drawn into a hard knot. Lilly was eager that Annie should indorse her in this view, for she did not intend to give up the whole church phase of the question;-desiring to maintain it as a beautiful rite, yet, at the same time, fearing lest it might have no foundation to rest upon.     230       Evangel Wiseman.           X "Indeed, I do believe so, Lilly," answered Annie,  X emphatically, leaving the shoe-string still tied, and stand-  ing up with a look of deep interest on her face. "I know - it is, for I have seen it oftentimes myself, when I was a child and used to stay with my Presbyterian aunt, who  made me read the Bible every day of my life.'     1 "I do wish we could find it, Annie; here, take my Bible, please, and look for it. I would do so, but I don't know where to begin. I know it is there; I know the apostles taught it as a duty, and baptized children too, in their day." And Lilly handed her friend her beautiful Bible, a birth-day gift from Mr. Wiseman.        a Annie took the book. "I do not know, Lilly, that I can find any of the places just now. It has been so long since I gave any attention to this matter. I have read all these things many a time, when I was a child, but of late I have { not read my Bible as much as I ought; I have found all I needed in my Prayer-book.-" "That is just the case with me, Annie; but I tell you, I am going to search the Bible until I find out all about this  matter. I won't remain ignorant any longer. I am deter mined to know for myself; and then, when I meet with any Baptists, I can prove to them that baptism is right,  even for the youngest child."              While Lilly was talking, Annie was turning over the leaves of the Gospels, vainly endeavoring to find what she - sought. She looked first in Matthew, then in Luke, then !  John, then turned to Mark, but nowhere could she overtake any instance; so she returned the book to Lilly, with a look - of deep mortification, saying: "( Well, I know it is there, and if I had more time I  would find it. I must post myself on this subject, and X when I go home, to-morrow, I will get down my little  e ^8   Immediate Results-Let us Look at Them. 231 Bible I used to read at aunt Margaret's, and I know that I can find all the passages, for she made me mark them." Lilly gathered up her beautiful hair, gave it a careless toss, and hastily putting in her comb to hold it in place, took the proffered book, and seating herself beside the lamp, began to search herself. She turned back and forth, from Matthew to Revelation, reading here a sentence that caught her eye, containing the word " baptize," or " bap- tism," and then another where she found " children"; but after much endeavor, which was altogether fruitless, in discovering "baptize children," or " baptized children," or the " baptism of children," she gave it up and laid the book beside her, remarking in an earnest tone: "This will not do. I must infdrm myself. I know it is there, but I must be able to turn to it in a moment; for I shall necessarily be thrown a great deal with the Baptists, and I know I shall have no peace of my soul, for they are always talking about their baptism and about our infant baptism. But I'll tell you, Annie, what is best for us to do. We must be present at the discussion between brother and Dr. Cheney, on this point. You know it is the subject at their next meeting. We'll get posted, then, in all our arguments. I mean to take pencil and paper, and write all the places down, and then I am going to mark them in my Bible, so as to be ready. I know that Dr. Cheney will make a splendid argument, if he did fail to-night. " /  IBe is very anxious to baptize little Vernon, and-he knows- "  full well, if he can show sister -that it is a duty, she will have it; done, even if his salvation does not depend upon it." "Do you think Mr. Wiseman will be willing, Lilly?" "Oh, yes, if he is convinced it is right. You know that he believes in baptism, but not in baptismal regeneration.     232       Evangel Wiseman.  All these Baptists are great sticklers for baptism. I used  to think they didn't caro for anything else. Is thought it  was all the religion they knew or advocated, but I find myself mistaken. Brother, you see, is as well informed about anything in the Bible, and out of it, as Dr. Cheney. And their minister, Dr. Eaton, is remarkably intelligent. I have never heard him preach, but brother and sister say, il and they arie both good judges, you know, that he is an excellent preacher. And Dr. Eaton's daughter, Fannic, is a splendid girl, just home from Vassar, accomplished and beautiful. I tell you, Annie, she will attract attention : wherever she is. I spent a day with her at sister's, last week, and I was completely fascinated. She is far prettier  and sprighther than Fannie Cheney, and you know she is   very interesting." "Yes, Fannie Eaton is a charming girl. Equal to any in our society. How Miss Mordaunt seems to take to her! I And we must inform ourselves, Lilly, for you know this  great preacher, Mr. Earle, all the way from 'Boston,' is to be here in a few days, now. The whole town will  be in a stir. Everybody will be going to hear him. Of   1 course, we will have to go, too, as it will be the fashion; i and we will be mixed up considerably with the Baptists.  and if we are not prepared to defend ourselves, they will,  no doubt, want to baptize us, too. - And you know, that young friend of Mr. Wiseman is daily expected; your    X brother told me to-night that he looked for him every   id train. We, of course, shall have to meet him, and if he is a Baptist, as your aunt Delia will have it, we, of course, will have to defend ourselves with him. And he is very  Hi learned, Mr. Wiseman says. Qh! my, my! how shall we  ever get through I And Annie threw up her hands in    N despair. - X!   Immediate Results-Let us Look at Them. 233 "Oh! Annie, we will listen to every word Dr. Cheney says, and then we can prove a match for any of them. He is fully acquainted with the whole subject, and you know brother will make the best defense he can; so we shall have it all, for and against. We'll be all right. Don't fear that. What troubles me most, is the thought that I  dear little Vernon may not get baptized after all. And :  just to think of it! That beautiful robe we are making I -im, all wasted, and that splendid cap at Madame Dude- fand's, that I had laid aside only this morning. How beautiful he would look in it! Wouldn't it be perfectly magnificent, some day during the great meeting, when the large hall is crowded, and- they say it will be, to have him brought in, and Dr. Cheney. to step out in his robes, and baptize him? Oh, I should be delighted! I know it would ' do no harm, if brother does say so Il  "Do you think Mr. Wiseman will ever allow the baby to be baptized, Lilly?" "Oh, I don't know that he will consent, but Aunt Delia is determined to have it done, and I think she will accom- plish it. She never yields; and this is with her a matter of vital importance. She will have Dr. Cheney to do it if it is possible. He, I know, is very anxious to, for several reasons. But then if the Doctor cannot, aumty will man-    age to have it done. That robe will have to be worn and. - that baby baptized in it, it matters not what brother says. I   We all know aunty's determination in religious matters full well. She would, I verily believe, have a Catholic priest to do it rather than it should not be done." "Good morning, Miss Dalian," said Bridget Mahoney,    with her broad Irish smile and accent, as she encountered i' ..     234       Evangel Wiseman. Miss Vernon at an early hour, in the dining room: "An be shure, the little darlint is baptized, ain't he? I would have been there, meself, to see it, but I was called away to see me sick cousin." "No, Bridget, Vernon is not baptized," answered Miss Delia curtly, as she dipped the spoon into the sugar dish, and then tasted the baby's milk.             : "An' he ain't, be sure I why! this is raaly too bad! I thought, be shure, the praiste had come for this very purpose. When will the little darlint recave the blessed sacrymint, Miss Daliah?" "Oh! I don't know, Bridget. These Baptists are so strange. No reason about them. You may argue, and argue, and argue, and you can't convince them I " and Miss Delia tasted the milk a second time. "But he will be baptized, be shure, Miss Daliah, the darlint. Pity, pity, to let him go down to darkness for, want of the blessed sacryment!" "Yes, Bridget, he will be baptized sooner or later. Of this there is no doubt; but I do not know when." J "Yes, that he will, be baptized by Dr. Cheney, too, and that before this big Baptist meeting; my word for that," said Miss Delia to herself, as she cleared the dining- room  door and passed up to attend to her precious charge. 9i 'I   I[         Embryos.          235 CHAPTER XV. EMBRYOS., THAT a time of study, conjecture and fear were those few days succeeding the last discussion, in which Dr. Cheney endeavored to prove that the united voice of the Church and the authority of Scripture taught baptismal regeneration, and, per conse- quence, all infants must be baptized in order to be saved! :il  His attempt, though labored, had failed of its object. Mr. Wiseman had clearly shown, from   the writings of the Fathers themselves, that a great difference of opinion had always existed on this very point, some adhering I    to the doctrine, others discarding it; and had proved most conclusively, from the very facts cognizant to all, that baptism did not, could not, regenerate, inasmuch g   as hundreds, who had submitted to the rite in infancy, were thieves, murderers, and liars. !He had also set the Doctor right with regard to the faith of the Baptists on this subject; had shown him that Baptists never had looked upon the ordinance as posses- sing any saving power, but had always contended that the Holy Spirit must convict and convince, and then, after a profession of faith in Christ, the believer was baptized in obedience to the command of his Lord, and to set forth in figure his faith in the death, burial and resur- rection of the Lord Jesus, as his only hope of salvation. Eventful epoch these days had proved, in the history of more than one of our characters. What consequences for weal or woe often hang on events of a few passing huours I     236       Evangel W ieman, How necessary that each one for himself shall heed the injunction of Christ: it Seek first the kingdom of heaven." Build upon the Eternal Rock, we shall never be moved. While some rejoiced, others were cast down and :per- plexed. From Evangel's mind all clouds as to the eternal safety of her buried boy were forever removed. Now   I she could look up and see her cherub child, saved by the atoning blood of the Lamb, safely sheltered in His bosom.  No rite of man could place him there. No omission of   1 an ordinance could shut him out. Safe, safe, forever safeI I She should go to him when the days of her earthly sojourn ! were accomplished. What sweet relief she enjoyed, only I! those mothers can know who have been similarly situated, I and like her have been led into the truth as it is in Christ I tesus. "Thanks be unto Him for this unspeakable gift."  I And yet, if the Bible enjoined infant baptism as a duty, Vernon must be baptized.   A  : Dr. Cheney was discomfited. Miss Delia was amazed    . and perplexed, and doubtful as to issues. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon had their minds aroused to the point of doubt, but they would never pursue the investigation until they  too should arrive at the full knowledge of what Christ taught His disciples in doctrine and ordinance. On the pathway of Lilly Vernon and Annie Chiles has come faintly stealing a beautiful light, dim, it is true, in its morning dawn, but which shall increase in effulgence and power until, guided by its heavenly beams, they shall reach the perfect day,-shall know for them-  selves those grand, undying truths, which the Crucified , One proclaimed in gentle voice ("he  shall not strive nor cry,")  yet with divine power,-for He spoke as   \ God,-along   the banks of the flowing Jordan, beside  I the peaceful lakes of Judea, on its mountain tops, and i   Embryos.          237 amid its quiet vales--in the streets of Jerusalem, in the synagogues of their cities, and in the splendors of the temple on Mount Moriah-- and knowing shall live thereby. Why will men take counsel of men in divine things, ' when Christ says "Learn of me?" A pleasant party of girls was that accidentally assem- bled in the pallor of Mr. Wiseman the evening after the, discussion. It was Saturday. Lilly Vernon and Annie Chiles, whose friendship had been strongly cemented by the frequent intimacies of the last two weeks, had come to pass the night with Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman, that they might take in charge the little Vernon on the following day, and permit both Evangel and Miss Delia to attend church. It was communion-Sabbath at the Baptist church, and Dr. Eaton always expected every member who possibly could, to be present on this day. It was also communion- Sabbath at Dr. Cheney's church, and Miss Delia had, from her confirmation in early childhood, made it a matter of strictest duty to be present at such seasons. Miss Delia was a woman of most undying adherence to what she believed to be right. She would not neglect any known duty, if it were within the range of possibility to discharge it. She gauged duty, however, by her own personal views, and rarely ever allowed the opinions of others, if contrary to her own, to influence her in the least. Her zeal was not of that ardent, glowing nature that could sweep its possessor into what reason had not thor- oughly weighed; but was of that quiet, persevering stamp which, when judgment had once decided favorably, would never turn aside ifrom the accomplishment of the object, for any obstacle within the range of possibility to vanquish.     238       Evangel Wiseman. And with this characteristic so strongly developed, and  firmly believing that infants ought to be baptized, because this has been the practice of the Church ever since it was  founded, (Miss Delia did not know that Episcopacy came out of Catholicism, and was founded on the willfulness of an irate king,) and was taught and enjoined by the Fathers and the Prayer-book, one need feel no wonder that she so tenaciously clung to her determination to have Vernon baptized, in the face of what, to almost any other mind, would have appeared insuperable difficulties. She believed she was right, therefore she acted. How many in this life we find doing thus, making their own personal judgment the criterion for right, in all things! ? And thus the subjects of erroneous teachings in childhood walk all the way along, guided by the light of their own false opinions, perversely holding on to their own little taper, instead of coming into the glad and glorious sunlight . i of the gracious gospel of the blessed God.  Why will men thus act? Why not " to the law and the  testimony?" "What is the chaff to the wheat?"  There is in the human mind such a disinclination to indi- vidual responsibility. We will not think for ourselves-will not search for ourselves, but allow another to do it for us; as if the "Thou must be born again" had no relevancy to us at all. Individual responsibility is the law of the gospel. Thou, thee, THNE, for thyself, and not another for thee. Every man, according to his own works, shall be judged. Fannie Eaton had called with a message from Dr. Eaton to Mr. Wiseman, relative to a young gentleman, Mr. Bur- leson, who had been taken suddenly very ill-a member of the bible-class of which Mr. Wiserman was teacher.   Embryos.          239 Miss Cheney had called to see Miss Delia on a matter of importance, strictly private. The girls were chatting away ipost merrily, when the footsteps of gentlemen were heard on the piazza. Lilly, who was sitting near the open window, as pure as the flower whose name she bore, turned her head suddenly and looked out. Instantly her face was suffused with crimson blushes. Starting from her seat, while an expres- sion of mingled wonder and confusion overspread her animated countenance, she exclaimed: "Brother, girls, and a strange gentleman I do believe it is Mr. Carlton, of New Orleans!" Words died out instantly among the gay throng, leaving important sentences forever unfinished. The girls were petrified. Mr. Carlton's arrival had been the subject of expectancy and conversation for ten days; and a number of young ladies, besides those assembled, were looking forward to the debut of the distinguished stranger in Chester, with the most eager interest. The door-bell rang. Bridget Mahoney was down town attending to the next day's edibles, and it devolved on Lilly to usher in the gentleman. Her confusion increased when she realized this dreadful fact. She felt more disposed to make her exit from the room. But necessity was imperative, she must obey. She calmed herself the best she could, and glancing into the mirror to re-adjust the rose which had fallen from the large coil of soft brown hair that encircled the head so gracefully above the delicate ear, she passed to the door, and encountered her brother and-Mr. Carlton. She extended her hand to the stranger in kindly wel- come. The blushes, despite her efforts, became visibly deepened.     240       Evangel  V Wiseman. Mr. Carlton was elegant. This she did not so mucn see as feel. Of coinmanding figure, fine address, with dark hair and eyes, features finely cut, voice rich and full, how could he be otherwise than captivating in his manner? Hie was shown into the parlor and introduced by Mr. Wiseman to the young ladies. Very soon all reserve had passed away, and the stranger, with his fine personnel, suavity of manners, and agreeable conversation, had won I all hearts.  The former interest was greatly heightened E by the presence of the long-expected guest. Who shall secure the prize? Who? was the half formed question of more than one mind present. Soon Miss Delia descended to the parlor to meet Miss Cheney.  She had heard the door-bell ring, but supposing it to be one of Lilly's young  lady friends, had 'given it no farther thought. Mr. Wiseman, rising as she entered, presented his friend, Mr. Carlton, of New Orleans. Miss Delia started back as if she had encountered a "heathen Chinee," or man-eating chimpanzee."  Her surprise was so marked that the young ladies could i but smile. All but Miss Cheney understood the why of   H Miss Vernon's surprise. She   supposed it was simply  i because Mr. Carlton was a  stranger--they knew it was because he was the stranger, and might be a Baptist. Miss Delia's confusion was so extreme  that she could not find a  chair. There she stood, vis-a-vising the polite Southerner, who would not be  seated while she was left standing. Miss Delia looked as if endeavoring to solve some intricate problem  in Euclid, her eyes fixed  searchingly on Mr. Carlton. She was asking herself,  ," Can he be a Baptist?," Mr.   Embryos.          241 Carlton was evidently becoming embarrassed, too. He was about to offer Miss Vernon his chair, when Mr. Wiseman, who had turned to address Miss Cheney, at the farther end of the room, observing the fiasco, stepped up and conducted Miss Delia to a seat near Miss Cheney. Soon the two ladies were engaged in conversation, but Miss Delia still continued to twitch nervously the white cuff on her left arm, as if it had suddenly grown too short and must be elongated. She could not forget the stranger's presence, but kept half an eye on him, questioning to herself, meanwhile, thus: "Can he be a Baptist? So nice-looking, so handsome! He can't. He dosen't look like one. And yet Herbert said he believed he was. But then he might be mistaken I  He's a splendid looking man, if he is a Baptist.. What, if some of these Episcopal girls, Lilly or Annie, or Fannie Cheney, should fall in love with him? It won't do. No more Episcopalians ought to marry Baptists. It causes too much trouble. Baptists ought to marry Baptists,- no right taking church-members for wives, and then turn- ing their heads upside down with all kinds of old-fash- ioned notions." Thus Miss Delia soliloquized, all the while endeavoring to sustain the conversation with Miss Cheney. This young lady observed her abstraction. Mr. Carlton was fully conscious that he was closely scrutinized by Miss Vernon. He could not think why she, rather than all those present, should fix her attention on him. He was engaged in general remarks with Miss Chiles and Mr. Wiseman, while Fannie Eaton delivered the Doctor's message for Mr. Wiseman to Lillie Vernon. Miss Cheney made every endeavor to overcome Miss Delia's abstraction, but in vain. Miss Vernon would look 16     242       Evangel Wiseman.        l at Mr. Carlton, and question whether he could be a Bap- tist, until Miss Cheney, in a subdued tone, announced that she had a message from her father for her. Where- upon Miss Delia was in a moment all interest, and withdrawing her attention from the stranger, she gave eager ear to the important disclosure of Miss Cheney, while the question, "Can he be a Baptist?" started up,  like Banquo's ghost, at all possible intervals. Miss Eaton rose, and, bidding adieu, left. She was soon  followed by Miss Cheney, who was accompanied to the  ! gate by Miss Delia, the two engaged in close conversation as they proceeded slowly down the walk. Fannie Cheney possessed a splendid person, so graceful, so lithe, yet- with sufficiently embonpoint to make her beautifully rounded in form and figure. Mr. Carlton who had not particularly observed her, as she sat at the farther side of the room, was struck with her handsome form and elegant carriage, as he beheld her, through the open window, pass down the walk to the street. "Your friend just leaving is Miss"- "Cheney," responded Annie Chiles, to whom the ques- ; tion was addressed; "the eldest daughter of our Bishop,  Dr. Cheney.                        Mr. Carlton bowed. "A very sweet girl, and intelligent, also," added Annie, scarcely knowing what, to say, as Mr. Carlton, for the i first time, seemed a little abstracted. Mr, Carlton bowed a second time, but remained silent. Annie's embarrassment increased. She could not tell why. She felt annoyed with herself thus to allow so much unnecessary emotion. There was no need of blushing, but blush she did, and that deeply.   Embryos.           243 In after years, dear girl, when looking back upon this ever-remembered hour, and viewing it in' the light of philosophy, you will readily understand why the heart beat so fast, and the color rose so high, and the sweet voice faltered. Mr. Carlton continued to look abstractedly out of the window, as Miss Vernon and her young friend paused at the gate, to complete their arrangements. Then suddenly, as if recalling himself, and wishing to faire amende for this seeming discourtesy, he turned with a very pleasant smile, yet with a tinge of sadness lingering, and asked some questions relative to the various denominations in Chester. Annie was but little informed with regard'to statistics. She, however, gave her general impression of numbers and position and influence. Miss Delia having arranged everything with Miss Cheney as best she could, re-entered the parlor. Just as she did so, she heard the word ' Baptist." She started back, paused and looked to see who it was that had pronounced it. It was indeed the guest, Mr. Carlton. Her heart fluttered, and, a great swelling of indignation rose up in her throat, which she could not choke down. "Yes, he is a BaptistI  That's settled!" she said to herself, as she walked to the extreme side of the room, and seating herself, began to twitch more earnestly than ever at the fated cuff. "I That ends the matter," she con- tinued musing. "It does-he needn't fall in love in this town. No more of 'Baptists' marrying church members. That thing is ended in Chester; I'll give my word on that!" (A very strong expression for Miss Vernon, and one she never us'ed but when determinedly excited.) "He'll not     244       Evangel Wiseman. mary one. 1'7 see to that in time, myself. No more of this trouble-we've bad enough of it, and sorrow enough, too. Poor little Herbert gone-gone to-- t., Miss Vernon did not complete her mental sentence. Just then she turned a look upon Lilly, who was replying to Mr. Carl- ton in a manner evidencing marked interest. Lillyfelt the look, and started in her chair-the color rose. But she conquered herself, and feeling a little disposed to mischief, she added, in a very impressive tone: "Indeed, sir, the Baptist minister is one of the most excellent preachers in the town; is doing a noble work for his denomination here; a great many attend his services, who did not go to church before he came, and his membership is constantly increasing. Scarcely a week passes by, sister, who is a member of his church, informs me, without additions. And then the great evangelist, Rev. Mr. Earle, from Boston, (perhaps you have heard of him; his fame is everywhere, I am told,) will be with Dr. Eaton to-morrow week, to hold a series of meetings. They say he is the most wonderful preacher of the age. Everybody is going to hear him." This last sentence Lilly pronounced with peculiar empha- sis, meanwhile casting a stolen glance at " aunty," who sat bolt upright in her chair, her face midnight blackness and her right hand twitching, twitching at that cuff. "Did you ever hear the Rev. Mr. Earle preach, Mr.  Carlton? Of course you have heard of him?" asked   ,A Annie Chiles, desirous, if possible, to ascertain if the gentleman was a Baptist or not.  "Oh! yes, I have heard him preach frequently in Rich.  mond, where I had occasion to spend twelve months, two years since; and I assure you he is worthy of his fame."  Miss Delia sat, her eyes fixed on the girls with such !   Embryos.          245 a look of disapprobation, one could have thought, to see her, that the young ladies were transcending all rules of etiquette, and rendering themselves obnoxious to their guest. She started from her chair, and was about to enter her protest against this "Rev. Mr. Baptist," of whom she knew nothing; but just at this juncture Mr. Wiseman, who-had passed up-stairs for his wife, entered the parlor and presented her to his friend. XMiss Delia swept out, and up into the room where the little Vernon lay asleep on his mother's bed, and bending over him, indulged in subdued ejaculations against Bap- :  tists generally, and Rev. Mr. Earle especially. Poor dear little Vernon l-yet unbaptized, and that, too, when she had put forth such effort, had done such planning, to have it effected before the dreaded Baptist preacher should reach X   Chester; for, as the poet has it, " coming events cast their shadows before," and Miss Delia felt impressed with the belief that if the deed was not done before Mr. Earle's visit, it would never be after. But if she could succeed in carrying out her purpose at all, it must be done privately, for the next day was the only intervening Sabbath before the meeting, and no arrangements were made savethe preparing of the beautiful robe, which Miss Delia had looked at every day since it was finished, and the purchase of the new cap from Madame Dudefand's. Mr. Carlton remained to tea. The evening passed most charmingly to all but Miss Vernon, for the guest was highly gifted in conversation, description especially, and had trav- eled the continent over. The little Vernon was brought down and introduced. The two gentlemen reverted to their boyhood and early manhood, when as bosom friends they had passed through college and had left their Alma Mater together, to enter upon the active duties of life. Since then     at    246      Evangel Wiseman. they had met but once, and that for only a few hours. And then the additional excitement of two beautiful and fasci- nating young ladies--all combined--drew forth, in their most attractive and impressive play, all their intellectual powers. All were entertained and instructed. Miss Delia alone remained reserved and cold. Nothing could thaw her; and I at an early hour she with-drew from the parlor and sought the babe, and her own reflections and plans-the one not 6  satisfactory, and the other not promising. Alone, perplexed -yet resolved-she sat in that room, where two weeks before she had undertaken to prove to Mr. Wiseman, as a fact he should not dare dispute, that infant baptism was taught in the Bible, and that by the Saviour himself. Mr. Carlton bade good evening seasonably. He knew that the next day was the Lord's Day, and preparation had to be made for its duties, in all Christian families. "If agreeable to the young ladies, he would call the fol- lowing morning and accompany them to church." The proffered escort was graciously accepted. The per- plexity with the young ladies, after h0 left, was to decide whether they should attend the Baptist or Episcopal church. t They did not know which Mr. Carlton would prefer, for they had not succeeded in ascertaining, as Miss Delia had done, if he were really a Baptist. They discussed the subject lengthily, but could not decide the question satisfactorily. So they determined'to leave its a adjustment to the circumstances of the following morning. - "' So your gay young gentleman is a 'Baptist I'" ejacu- ' lated Miss Delia, in the most contemptuous tone, before the I young ladies had fully entered the room. Her face wore a very sarcastic smile, and her whole attitude was express- i ive of ireful indignation.  J     "     -,      :    Embryos.          247 "Oh, no, aunty, not at all that we know of-he did not intimate his religious sentiments."  "Oh, you needn't tell me any such tale, Lilly Vernon  Didn't I hear him expressly declare to Annie here, that he was a Baptist? You heard him, Annie?" "Oh, no, Miss Delia; excuse me, you are altogether mis- taken. We talked about all the denominations, and Mr. Earle, and the meeting to begin next Sabbath. We tried to find out what, Church he belongs to, but we didn't succeed. As Lilly has just remarked, he didn't even allude to his own religious views." "Annie Chiles, I heard him say when I entered the room, after having gone out with Fannie Cheney, that he was a Baptist! You needn't deny it." "Indeed, Miss Delia, if Mr. Carlton made such an asser- tion, it escaped me altogether; and I was on the lookout all the while to catch the least intimation in that direction." "I know I heard him say ' Baptist,' and I believed he was answering your question as to what he was. I tell you I am glad to hear I'm mistaken, girls, for if he is a Baptist, you needn't fall in love with him. I tell you, not another 'church member' shall marry a Baptist in this town, if I can help it." "Why, aunty, why?" exclaimed Lilly, turning squarely 'round and gazing at her aunty with a look of unmistakable consternation. "Why, Miss Delia," added Annie at the same moment, I think Baptists are a delightful people, if Mr. Carlton is a representative of themX." "Oh, Annie, I understand you full well. You are pleased with this young man. That's all right, if he is a churchman or anything else but a Baptist. And really, he does look too handsome and intelligent to belong to that class of ,     248       Evangel Wiseman... people. But, I'll just tell you girls, right here, and I want you-do you hear me, Lilly Vernon?" said Miss Delia to that young lady, who had gone to the mirror to take a look at herself in the light of the impression she had made on the visitor. "Do you hear me, Lilly Vernon?" repeated Miss Delia, not having succeeded at first in attracting her niece's attention. , I tell you and Annie, and I want you to tell all your friends--I talked with Fannie Cheney myself --that if this young man is a Baptist, not one of our girls shall marry him, and I know Dr. Cheney and all the sensible mothers will say I'm right." "Why, aunty, how can you help people loving and marry- ing those they love?" "Don't ask such questions, Lilly Vernon, but make haste and retire. You know this thing ought never to be; making, as it always does, so much trouble for everybody, letting the children of the Church stray off, and let their little ones die and be lost. Good-night, girls, good-nightI Get to bed as soon as you can, for I want every one to be up early to-morrow I And Miss Delia closed the door and sought her own room. The midnight moon looked in through the open case- ment upon her, and found her awake and thinlng.   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    249 CHAPTER XVI. DO THE SCRIPTURES OF DIVINE TRUTH TEACH INFANT BAP- TISM AS A DUTY ENJOINED ON CHRISTIAN PARENTS? THE Sabbath came, sweetly calm and peaceful. The earth, dressed in her gorgeous robes of spring-tinted hues, lay basking in the smile of heaven. How beautiful this world is! We look out upon it and say, in all the fervor of adoring love: "God our Maker is good, He kindly regardeth us." But oh I how transcend- enftly glorious must heaven be, when we know that, with all we see and all we can imagine, it hath not yet-nor can it-enter into the heart of man to conceive of its glories! How our souls should longingly look up, and by faith seize and make our own, the joys and blessedness of that home of light l Miss Delia could not sleep through the night. Its hours were passed in restless anxiety. The time was-short, and seemingly no progress made. She rose early. She had determined to ask Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman this pointed question: "Will you have Vernon baptized if the Bible teaches infant baptism?"Her plans could not be consum- mated until this matter was conclusively settled. So, when assembled at the breakfast-table, after morning prayer, Miss Delia interrupted the general conversation by saying: "Mr. Wiseman," (Miss Delia always addressed him thus when she desired to be very impressive,) "I wish you and Evangel to answer me one question explicitly." "Well, aunty, what is it?" responded Mr. Wiseman, turning from his remarks to Annie Chiles, and giving the most respectful heed to Miss Vernon.     250       Evangel Wiseman. "Iwant you both to tell me if you will have the baby baptized publicly, if you find on Tuesday night that it is enjoined upon you in the Bible?" "Most assuredly, aunty. Have I not told you, from the very outset of this serious matter, that if I could be con- vinced it was my duty, I should not hesitate to have it done, let it cost what,it might?" "I agree with Herbert fully, aunty," added Evangel, cheerfully, passing to Miss Delia a second cup of coffee. "Well, that's settled I understand you both now, and I suppose if Dr. Cheney shows you, in plain English, the command of the Saviour, and also examples where chil- dren were baptized in His day, you will be convinced?" "Of course, aunty, we will, and will immediately have the ordinance administered. We have no desire to leave undone anything Christ has commanded." "Very well---very well; I understand now, and I'm glad of it." And Miss Vernon drank her coffee, and ate her hot muffin with evident satisfaction. Of the incidents and results of that lovely Sabbath day we shall hereafter speak. ".To the law and to the testimony, Doctor!', And Mr. Wiseman placed the large family Bible on the table before Dr. Cheney, opened at the first chapter of Matthew. They were all assembled around the table, as on the two previous occasions. Mrl. Carlton, by special invitation of each member of the family, save Miss Delia, was present to hear the important discussion, involving such moment i ous results. Seated between the young ladies, and vis-a-vis to Miss Delia, he had a fine opportunity to enjoy the argu. ments for and against, and also the effect on the minds of the company.   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    251 "We have seen, Doctor, I think," added Mr. Wiseman, seating himself at the Doctor's right hand, 'that it can't be for the purpose of regenerating the soul that children are baptized, even according to your own church adthori- ties. For we find such a difference of opinion as to the object of infant baptism in the Pedo-Baptist world, and, indeed, in your church, as to prove conclusively that bap- tismal regeneration cannot be accepted as a doctrine of those who hold and practice infant baptism. And now that we wish to settle all outlying points before turning to the voice of the Scriptures, we will en passant look into the history of this rite. A few evenings since, I made some memoranda on this source of authority; and I think, from what we must all admit to be indubitable proof, that infant baptism was not practiced at all before the latter end of the second or the beginning of the third century. Then, should we find there is no warrant for it in the Bible, we must conclude, Doctor, that this ordinance is the invention, of men, and not the command of the Master." Miss Delia looked horrified at this assertion. She felt she must speak, but she dared not. So she bit her lips and choked down her indignation, twitched her cuff, and readjusting herself in her seat, turned a broad square look luon the two gentlemen at the head of the table. The Doctor made no reply. He was nervous and ill at ease. He knew this to be a fact, admitted by all eccle- siastical historians, but it was one which he had deter- mined, if possible, to keep in abeyance. Mr. Wiseman had taken upon himself the initiative of this discussion; and reaching to the small table beside him for the memoranda, he proceeded to prove his point. All were breathlessly attentive, as, unfolding the first page, he read in a clear voice:     252       Evangel Wiseman. "Salmasius and Suicerus say, 'In the two first centuries no one was baptized until, being instructed in the faith and acquainted with the doctrine of Christ, he was able to profess himself a believer.' 'He that believeth and is baptized.' First, therefore, he was to believe. "M. De la Roque says: 'The primitive church did not baptize infants; and the learned Grotius proves it in his 'Annotations on the Gospel.' Venema testifies: 'It is indeed certain that Pedo-Baptism was practiced in the second century, yet so that it was not the custom of the Church, nor the general practice, much less was it gen- erally esteemed necessary that infants should be baptized.'  . Tertullian has nowhere mentioned Pedo-Baptism among the traditions of the Church, nor even among the customs of the Church, that were publicly received and usually observed; nay, he plainly intimates that in his time it was a doubtful affair, for in his book, De Baptismo, chapter xxiii, he dissuades from baptizing infants, and proves, by certain reasons, that the delay of it to a more mature age is to be preferred; which he certainly would not have done if it had been a tradition and a public custom of the Church, seeing he was very tenacious of traditions; nor, had it been a tradition, would he have failed to mention it. Nothing can .be affirmed with certainty con- cerning the custom of the Church before Tertullian, seeing there is not anywhere in more ancient writers, undoubted mention of infant baptism. "Justin Martyr, in his second Apology, mentions only the baptism of adults. "Episcopius denies that any tradition can be produced for Pedo-Baptism till a little before the Milevitan Council, A. D. 418, and maintains that it was not practiced in Asia until near the time of that Council. Mr. Brandt h besnr h   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   253 Curcelleus explicitly says: 'The baptism of infants in the first two centuries after Christ was altogether unknown, but in the third and fourth was allowed by some few. In the fifth and following ages is was generally received. The custom of baptizing infants did not begin before the third age (or century) after Christ was born. In the former ages, no trace of it appears, and it was introduced without the command of Christ.' "Rigaltius testifies as follows, and this, together with the testimony of Johannes Bohemius, which I shall adduce, I think will go far to show how and for what purpose 'infant baptism' was introduced. Rigaltius says: 'In the Acts of the Apostles we read that both men and women were baptized, when they believed the gospel preached by Philip, without any mention being made of infants. From the apostolic ages, therefore, to the time of Tertullian, the matter is doubtful. Some there were from that saying of our Lord,'-not, you see, Doctor, from any command,- 'Suffer little children to come unto me, (to whom, never- theless, our Lord did not command water to be adminis- tered,) who took occasion to baptize new-born infants. And, as if they had been transacting some secular affair with God, they offered sponsors or sureties to Christ, who engaged that they (the children) should not depart from the Christian faith when adults, which practice displeased Tertullian.' "And now Johannes Bohemius tells that 'Baptism of old was administered to none (unless upon urgent neces- sity) but to such as were before instructed in the faith and catechised. But when it came to be judged necessary to everlasting life, it was ordained that infants should be bap- tized, and that they should have godfathers and godmothers who should be sureties for infants and should renounce the devil in their behalf.'     254       Evangel Wiseman. "This, I think, Doctor, accounts for the introduction of 'infant baptism.' Those who professed to follow .Christ, lost sight of the great doctrine of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, and attached to an ordinance the idea of saving power. And then the introduction of infant baptism became, from this very corruption, a necessity. If salva- tion depended on baptism, then all should be baptized that all might be saved. And I think the very fact that sponsors were required to make confession of sin, and guarantee for the child that it would not depart from the Christian faith, is strong proof that, before, it was the persons themselves who, in their own name desired baptism for themselves, making a profession of their faith in Christ. "And just on this point, Doctor, we know that Augus- tine, being instructed in the faith, was not baptized until he was about thirty years of age. Ambrose, who was born of Christian parents, and instructed in the Christian faith, was unbaptized until he was chosen Bishop of Milan. Jerome, the son of Christian parents, was also about thirty years of age before he received baptism. Nectarius was made Bishop of Constantinople before he was baptized. And now, Doctor Cheney, I will call upon you to say if the facts I have adduced are not on record, and also the testimony to the fact that infant baptism is not certainly mentioned before the time of Tertullian." "You are right, Mr. Wiseman," responded the Doctor hesitatingly, while his face became overspread with a look so grave and serious that his friends grew nervous. "But, then," he added, "you see it is found in partial use, as early as the third century, and analogy authorizes us to suppose that it existed antecedently, but owing to the little histori- cal light which comes down to us from the first and second centuries, we can find no certain evidence that it was prac-   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    255 t And yet lrenisus, who lived in the latter half of the second century, uses this remarkable language: 'There- fore, as he, Christ, was a Master, he had also the eye of a Master; not disdaiiing nor going ing a way above human nature, nor breaking in His own Person the law which He had made for mankind, but sanctifying every several, age by the likeness that it has to Himself, for He came to save all persons by Himself. All, I mean, who by Him are regener- ated unto God, infants and little ones, and children and youths, and elder persons. Therefore, He went through the several ages-for infants being made an infant, sanctifying infants; to little ones He was made a little one, sanctifying that age, and also giving an example of godliness, justice and dutifulness; to youth He was a youth,' etc., etc." And do you take this passage in Irenaeus to teach infant baptism, Doctor?" "Assuredly I do." "What portion of it?" "Why, here, where it speaks of infants regenerated unto God by Christ." "Certainly the term 'renascuntur' there used by Irenaeus cannot mean baptism-has nothing to do with it. Here, Doctor, see what President Sears testifies on this point. Hie says first: 'The phrase, "regenerated through Christ unto God," if it mean the general recovery of' man through Christ's incarnation and redemption, has numer- ous parallels in the writings of Irenseus; if it mean "4baptized through Christ unto God," it has no parallel -absolutely none.' "Hris second remark on this passage is, 'The phrase "baptism through Christ unto God," is an incongruous idea nowhere to be found in the Scriptures, in the wri- tings of Irenseus, or in any other Father or writer, ancient or modern.'     256       Evangel Wiseman. "And again he says, 'Regeneration standing alone, with- out any such word as " baptism" or " bath," prefixed, and governing it in the genitive, never means baptism, in Irenaeus.'  "Fourthly he remarks, "That Christ sanctified infants by becoming an infant Himself, has several parallels in Irenseus. He became an infant to aid our weak apprehen- sion; He became an infant with us (sunene piazin); on this account He went into Egypt sanctifying the infants that were there.'  "All those similar passages from Irenaeus show conclu- sively, Doctor, that this Father does not mean 'baptize' in your quotation. For you yourself must admit that it would be absurd to suppose that the 'infant Jesus baptized the Egyptian infants.' "Of this passage, Baumgarten-Crusius says: ' This cele- brated passage in Irenaeus is not to be applied to infant baptism, for the phrase renasci per eum (i. e., Christum,) in Deus, evidently means the participation of all in His divine and holy nature, in which He became a substitute for all.' "Winer, in his Lectures, says: 'Tertullian is the first that mentions infant baptism. Irenmus does not mention it as has been supposed.' "Rossler, in his Library of the Christian Fathers, Vol. I, p. 11, declares, 'All the arguments put together do not prove that in Deum (in your passage) means, to be baptized.' "Von Coelin says: ' All the traces of infant baptism are very uncertain. Tertullian is the first who mentions it, and he censures it.' "It must be apparent to you, Doctor, as well as to all present, that this passage of Irenaeus which has sometimes been quoted in favor of infant baptism, according to your   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    257 Pedo-Baptist authorities, has no relevancy to the rite what- ever, and that the first mention of the baptism of children, not infants-the very first is in Tertullian's famous letter to Quintilla, the patroness of a small sect in Pepiza, a town of Phrygia. These are his words, from which his meaning may be gathered by all disposed to seek the truth: 'Bap- tism ought not to be administered rashly; this the adminis- trators of it know.       It is, therefore, most expedient to defer baptism, and to regulate the administra- tion of it according to the condition, the disposition, and the age of the person to be baptized; and especially in the case of little ones .....  Indeed the Lord saith, 'Forbid them not to come unto me.' And let them come while they are growing up; let them come and learn, and let them be instructed when they come, and when they understand Christianity let them profess themselves Chris- tians. Why should that innocent age hasten to the remis- sion of sins? People act more cautiously in secular affairs; they do not commit the care of Divine things to such as are not intrusted with temporal things.' "Now, you must readily understand, Doctor, that Ter- tullian, who wrote about the beginning of the third cen- tury, by the term little ones' did not--could not have meant infants, but young persons; for he speaks of them ' coming,' and being 'instructed' when they have come." The Doctor could not answer. It had been conclusively proved that no mention of "infant baptism" could be found earlier than the third century. Why, then, if it ,were of apostolical origin, should the early writers thus ignore it? "But just here let me read you what Dr. Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, says in a letter to Mr. Tombs: "' I believe and know that there is neither precept nor 16     zoo   .    JSElvangel Wiseman. example i- Scripture for Pedo-Baptism, nor any just evidence for it, for about two hundred years after Christ. Sure I am, that in primitive times they were catechumeni, then MTluminati or baptizati. The truth is, I do believe Pedo-Baptism, how or by whom I know not, came into the world in the second century, and in the third and fourth began to be practiced, though not generally.' - And now let me read you an extract from Dr. Bunsen. It is here in his "HEippolytus and his Times."* He sums up his own historical views on this question. Hear him: I "' The difference then between the ante-Nicene and the  later church, was essentially this: The later church, with the exception of converts, only baptized new-born infants, and she did so on principle. The ancient (the ante-Nicene) church, as a general rule, baptized adults, and only after they had gone through a course of instruction; and as the exception only, Christian children who had just arrived at the years of maturity, but never infants. Tertullian's opposition is to the baptism of young growing children. He does not say one word about new-born infants. Neither does Origen, when his expressions are accurately weighed. Cyprian, and some other African bishops his cotemporaries, at the close of the third century, were the first who viewed baptism in the light of a washing away of the universal sinfulness of human nature, and connected this idea with that ordinance of the Old Testament-cir- cumcision.' -"He also gives some reasons why the Church has been dragged into this 'wrong path,' and -says in conclusion: "This is the consequence of the admission of an untruth. When the Church attached rights, and promises of blessing 'Vol. 3, page 199.   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    259 to anything, except to the conscious abandonment of sin, and to the voluntary vow of dedicating life and soul to the Lord, the consciousness of sin and the longing -for real truthful reformation died away in the same poportion among her members.' "Neander here says: 'Baptism was administered at first only to adults, as men were accustomed to conceive baptism and faith as strictly connected. We have all reason for not deriving infant baptism from apostolic institution.' * "Now, Doctor, I think I have conclusively shown that I  infant baptism was not practiced earlier than the third century, and was introduced because the churches had so : far fallen away from the doctrines of Christ and the Apostles, as to believe that baptism regenerated the soul. This error once admitted into the churches, you can readily see how infant baptism was a necessary conse- quences. Salvation by and through baptism. No salva- tion without baptism. Infants needed to be saved, there- fore, infants must be baptized. "Now, Doctor, we will turn to the Bible. And now that we have reached the divine authority, we shall find it, if  Christ designed it should be an ordinance of His gospel 'hurches. For we must admit that in the .New Testament Scriptures there is to be found all the instruction necessary to carry on the Redeemer's kingdom as He designed." "Oh, there are many things Christians do, that are not commanded in the Scriptures, Mr. Wiseman-for instance, the various religious organizations, missionary societies, Sabbath-schools, eleemosynary institutes, etc." Very true, Doctor, these are moral obligations, but not positive duties. You advocate infant baptism as a positive * Vol. 1, page 811.     260       Evangel Wiseman. command, and, therefore, right. Let us see what the Scrip- tures say on this point. If contained therein, I admit I have never, after all my searching, been able to find it." There was a pause. Each looked at other, but no one dared to speak, not even Miss Delia, whose countenance began to emerge from the forlorn expression which it had worn for some minutes; "for now," she said to herself, "this matter is going to be settled once for all, and the  baby will be baptized."            f - Dr. Cheney took the Bible; -deliberately turned its leaves over, compressing his lips, while a slight frown marked his expression, just as if endeavoring to decide where to begin. He turned on cautiously, until he reached the sixteenth chapter of Mark. All eyes were fixed upon him. He read the commission, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved. He that believeth not, shall be damned." And without waiting a moment, he proceeded to say: "Now, we all know that children cannot believe, but we also know that it is a fact that such is the close rela- tion of parent and child, that there exists a law of organic connection of character, as well as of physical life. The character of the one is actually included in that of the other as seed is formed in the capsule, and there remains until, by nutriment from the parent stem, it is prepared to bevsepa- rated from -it. Now, we know that thousands believe this doctrine as regards evil character, but have no thought of it as regards the good. If the evil is propagated in the child, why not the good? Why not the faith of the parents accord- ing to this acknowledged law be the faith of the child? and if so, and who can deny it in the light of this legitimate reasoning--why, I say, should not the child be baptized,   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    261 seeing it has from its very relation to its parents inherited their faith? You Baptists, Mr. Wiseman, in your extreme individualism, lose sight entirely of these great organic laws, whereby-society, the church, the state, the family, are built up. All your theories of religion are built up on this great error of individualism. You carry your doctrine of free will so far, that you entirely ignore the very impress of God Himself as evolved in nature and in covenant, ' To thy seed, and thy seed's seed.' I will not argue for infant bap- tism on the presumption that it came in the room of circum- cision. I'll leave this for my Presbyterian friends to do, but I do say with my learned friend Dr. Bushnell, that in view of organic powers and relations-of a connection of char- acter between the parent and the child-that the seal of the faith in the parent should be applied over to the child on the ground of a presumption that his faith is wrapped up in the parent's faith, so that he is counted a believer from the beginning. Thus it is, sir, that infant baptism becomes an appropriate rite. It sees the child in the parent, counts him presumptively a believer and a Christian, and with the parents baptizes him also. The child'l faith is wrapped up in the parents' faith, the two are too closely connected by organic law ever to be separated, and the child, to all intents and purposes a believer because of his connection, is baptized as such. Hience, we have household baptisms, and--" "Yours is indeed an ingenious argumenti Doctor, allow me to say," interrupted Mr. Wisemari. "Its speciousness   '  is well calculated to impress us all. But let us, before proceeding to household baptisms, just look at this law of organic faith in the light of facts and the teachings of 1g   the word of God. We all know that it is impossible for a child to believe." ^ '    *    '               - '     262      EJvangel Wiseman. 4' Oh! not actually believe, Mr. Wiseman, but presump- tively. The- child cannot for itself believe, but inherits the faith of its parents, which faith will be made manifest when he is sufficiently developed." "But even this view of yours, Doctor, is contradicted by facts patent to all. We all know the children of Chris- tian parents, baptized in infancy, have proven thieves and murderers. And then, this Baptist error of individualism which you seem so much to deprecate, I hold is the express teaching of Christ, and of all the New Testament writers. John said to the Jews, who claimed, as- you do, organic relation-' Think not to say within yourself we have Abraham to our father.' The Pharisees and Sadducees, organically related to Abraham, and, as you would argue, possessing his faith, came to John's baptism. According to your judgment, John should have baptized them. Indeed, the fact that they came, would seem an additional reason; but John looked upon them, and said: ' Oh, generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits meet for repentance.' Here, you see, is individualism, Doctor. And he added: 'Think not to say within yourself we have Abraham to our father,'  -boast not of your organic unity with Abraham--' for I say unto you, God is able of these stones to raise up chil- dren unto Abraham.' He continues: ' The axe is laid unto the roots of the tree-therefore every tree which bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire ; and Christ said to Nicodemus,' Ye must be born again.'  Individualism here, Doctor. 'Not of flesh nor of blood- -- nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of my Spirit, saith the Lord.' Here is individual responsei bility, and the regeneration of the Holy Spirit." "The commission, as I read it, commands all to be bap-  i tized, Mr. Wiseman," interposed Dr. Cheney, feeling the r   The Scriptures versus Infant Japtzsm.   zoo force of his opponent's cogent reasoning, yet unwilling to admit it. "By no means, Doctor,-only those who can believe; and as we know that children cannot believe, nor their parents believe for them, we must necessarily conclude that children are not included in the Saviour's great com- mission. If there is a command for baptism of infants, it must be found elsewhere. It is not here. Believers are to be baptized. Children cannot be believers, therefore children are not to be baptized. There is no authority for your rite in the commission. No explanation could plant it there. Believers, and believers alone-none others. Children could never be believers in infancy, not even presumptively." "But did not the Apostle Peter, in his great sermon, say, 'Repent and be baptized'? Here are his very words;. let me read them to you all: 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, FOR THE PROMSE IS TO YOU AND YOUR CHLDREN. '  The Doctor looked up with a pleased expression. He seemed to think this was quite conclusive. His friends felt relieved. Miss Delia was joyous, for this was testi- mony she never knew anything of before; and did there not yet remain, "Suffer little children," and "Now are your children holy"? All awaited Mr. Wiseman's reply. "Read on, Doctor, if you please," he requested gently. "And to all them that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord your God shall call.'" "A little farther, Doctor, if you please." ,' Then they that received the word were baptized, and     264      Evangel Wiseman the same day there were added to them about three thou- sand souls." "Theire is certainly no infant baptism here, Doctor, allow me to say, not even inferentially. 'Children' is a term often used for descendants; undoubtedly it is so here; and the promise is as much to those who are afar off, as it is to children, even to as many as the Lord God shall call. Let us look at this case of baptism. Peter preached repentance, as John had done. The people were pricked in their heart-- 'they that gladly received the word were baptized.' Chil- dren could neither be convicted nor convinced-neither could be 'pricked in their hearts,' nor 'gladly receive the word'-therefore were not baptized by Peter. And I think, Doctor, if you turn to all the instances of baptism recorded in the New Testament, you will find no mention of infants." "But it is not forbidden, Mr. Wiseman, and therefore it is lawful. And we, have such strong inferential proof, from the sayings of Christ relative to children, and also of Paul, that I must insist it is a duty enjoined upon all Christian parents." "Enjoined by whom, Doctor?" "By the teachings of the Bible." "Where is the injunction, and where the examples? Surely it is not in the commission; on this point all must agree. Baptism is a positive ordinance. It is right, because Christ has commanded believers to submit to it. He has nowhere commanded infants, and therefore I hold that we have no right to foist this practice on to our churches as a gospel ordinance. Christ wishes us to do what He has commanded, nothing more. We have no right to devise ordinances for His kingdom. He is the lawgiver. We, the subjects of His kingdom, must obey what He has ordained."   Th/e Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.  265 But, Mr. Wiseman, how do you dispose of the words of Christ, 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not '? How can they come unless in baptism? And then these words of the Apostle, ' For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.' And the household baptisms-they certainly included infants. There was the household of Crispus, the family of Stephanus, the house- hold of the jailor, and the household of Lydia. Think you there were no children found in all these families?" As to the text you have adduced, Doctor, where Christ says: 'Suffer little children to come unto me,' I will answer you in the words of Pool, Bishop Jeremy Taylor, and Olshausen: "Matthew Pool, a Presbyterian, says: 'We must take heed that we do not found infant baptism on this passage, for it is certain Christ did not baptize these children.' "Bishop Taylor is quite as explicit. Hear his words- he says; 'From the action of Christ's blessing little chil- dren, to infer that they are to be baptized, proves nothing so much as that there is a want of a better argument, for the conclusion would with more probability be derived thus: Christ blessed infants and so dismissed them, but baptized them not: therefore infants are not to be bap- tized.' "Olshausen says: 'Of that reference to infant baptism which it is so common to find in this passage, there is not the slightest trace.' "Now, Christ did not baptize these children, for it is expressly declared in John, that he himself baptized none. The disciples had not formerly baptized them, else they would not have forbidden their being brought to Christ.     266       Evangel Wiseman. Christ. did not then and there command the disciples to baptize them, though He blessed them and declared them to be of the kingdom of heaven. "And respecting the second quotation: 'Then are your children holy', I will answer you in the language of the Rev. Dr. Albert Barnes. He says, ' There is not one word about baptism here, nor any allusion to it; nor does the argument in the remotest degree bear upon it. The ques- tion was not, whether children should be baptized, but whether there should be a separation between man and wife when one was a Christian and the other was not.' "This is a question of legality, whether the husband or the wife should be discarded because of their not being a Christian. Paul says, not so. This would cause endless difficulties and litigations with regard to posterity. The argument is: ' You must not put away your unbelieving wives if they are willing to remain with you, otherwise  you must also discard your children, as the law of separa- tion from the heathen obliged the Israelites to do with regard to the children conjoined- with the unclean party. Under the gospel dispensation, both the unbelieving party and the children are to be- retained. " "'Oh, Mr. Wiseman this is your Baptist rendering of that very conclusive passage in favor of our practice." "Not at all, Dr. Cheney. I think, sir, your assertion is wholly unfounded. Be kind enough to turn to the chapter. It is the seventh of lst Corinthians, and the fourteenth verse, I believe. Now read, if you please, a few verses preceding the fourteenth." The Doctor did as requested. 9"Now, Doctor, read, if you- please, the succeeding verses." The Doctor obeyed.   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    267 "It is evident, Doctor, to all, that the Apostle is teaching the Corinthians, that under the gospel dispensation a man must not put away his wife because she did not believe in Christianity, nor the wife her husband. Some of the Corinthian Christians had scruples about the lawfulness of living in the marriage relation with an unbeliever. Now Paul would have them understand that if the unbe- lieving wife or husband was unclean and must be aban- doned, then by parity of reasoning the children were unclean and must also be abandoned. But this was absurd. It is manifest that, instead of being unclean, they are holy or clean. "And, moreover, Doctor, that you may know I am not mistaken, you must see that the kindred expression 'is sanctified,' as applied to the unbeliever, attributes as much holiness, and holiness of the same nature, to the unbeliev- ing wife or husband, as is attributed to the children of the Corinthian Christians. It is evident that the language does not imply, in the least, that the unbelieving consort shall be baptized. How, then, can you, infer that the unbe. lieving children should be baptized? This passage testifies positively, I think, that children were not baptized in the times of the Apostles. Surely your argument has no sup- port in either the commission or these two texts you have quoted. If the practice of infant baptism is enjoined, it is elsewhere, that is eertain." The Doctor appeared confused. New light had burst suddenly on his vision. But the suddenness served to blind him. He could not answer Mr. Wiseman's logic; so, after some confusion, he remarked: "I must look at this, Mr. Wiseman, another time. But let us look at the baptism of the households. Surely, infer. entially at least, we shall find children there. Here is the     268       Evangel Wiseman. first, that of Crispus, in Acts 18: 8, which reads thus: 'And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinth- ians, having believed, were baptized.'  The Doctor reddened as he proceeded. Why, surely, there were no infants in the household of Crispus, for he believed on the Lord with all his house, and not one word about any baptism of the family. He made no comment. The facts were too plain for even inferential "infant baptism." So, without hesitation, but with some degree of agitation, he turned to the account given in I. Corinthians 1: 16, and read aloud: "'And I also baptized the household of Stephanus."'  "Here, Mr. Wiseman," said the Doctor, with some degree of exultation, "Here is a household baptism, and if we can prove infants were baptized in this instance, it will be sufficient to establish precedent, I suppose." "It undoubtedly will, sir, if you can find it. I shall most willingly grant you that you have example, if not command, for your practice." "Well, sir, I hold that what is said of those household baptisms is proof positive that infants were baptized in the times of the Apostles, if they were not included in the commission; baptized in and because of the supposed faith of the parents. The household baptisms, as I have said, are three times distinctly mentioned:-in this instance, where nothipg. at all is said of faith;--in the case of Lydia, where everything turns on the personal faith of Lydia,-' If ye have judged me to be faithful;' and, in the third case, that of the jailor, 'he rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.' But here you will see, Mr. Wiseman, that the participle, 'believing,' is singular and not plural in the original, and the phrase 'with all his house,' plainly   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   269 belongs to the verb, and not to the participle. Rigidly translated, the passage would read-' he rejoiced with all his house, himself believing.'" "But let me ask, Doctor, how could the infants rejoice any more than they could believe? If the whole household rejoiced, while the jailor only believed, does it not add to your difficulty? Surely, if they could all rejoice, they could all believe, and, of course, could be baptized on their own faith." The Doctor was in a dilemma, undoubtedly. His sin- gular participle could not relieve him, as, long as all the house rejoiced. His confusion was manifest to all. Miss Delia was filled with chagrin inexplicable. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon were thinking. The young ladies and Mr. Carlton  were on Mr. Wiseman's side of the argument. Of course Evangel stood with her husband. Mr. Wiseman's arguments were so well put, that Dr. Cheney found himself unable to answer them. He had intended to assume the affirmative himself, and throw the responsibility of refutation on his opponent. But Mr. Wiseman had not left this to him to do, but boldly coming up to the attack, he had stormed the strongholds, and thus far taken them. He had shown there was no command for his opponent's practice in the commission of the Lord Jesus;-that the' doctrine of baptismal regeneration was repudiated by many of the best men who advocated infant baptism, and, moreover, that the facts patent to all proved it a fearful heresy. Therefore, there was no inherent necessity for it; and viewed in the light of salvation, it was a work of supererogation. Then he had shown that, according to the best Pedo-baptist authorities, it was not an apostolic practice, and was not generally used until the third and fourth centuries. Also, that the various texts of     270       Evangel Wiseman. Scripture that had, at different ages and by different men, been depended upon for support, had been entirely dis- carded by learned Pedo-baptist authors. Now there was nothing left to the Doctor but the inferential proof from *the household baptisms. There was a fearful pause. The Doctor did not seem. disposed to resume. His ground, thus far, had given way at every step. Could he find a foothold, even an inferential one? Mr. Wiseman, desirous to throw what light he could on the cases of Stephanas and Lydia, resumed: "As regards the case of Stephanas and his household, mentioned by Paul, will you please turn to the sixteenth chapter, fifteenth verse, of this same epistle, and we shall there learn probably if there were infants baptized." Doctor Cheney turned the leaves rapidly, and finding the place specified, read: "Ye know the household of Stephanas that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints." "Is it not manifest, Doctor, from this text, that there were no infants in this household? They who were baptized addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,' which infants could not do. Dr. McKnight says of this passage: The family of Stephanas seems all to have been adults when tlhey were baptized; for they are said to have -addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints.' And -now we come, Doctor, to Lydia and her household-in my judgment the very nearest approximation to infant baptism in the New Testament, and yet no more teaching it, unless by unwarranted inference, than it teaches whether Lydia had children or not, and if so, how many." "You admit, thena, Mr. Wiseman, that this will decide i my favor?"   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   2T. "Not at all, sir. I only accede that this is the only semblance of authority or example that Pedo-baptism has. Please read." The Doctor had already found the place-Acts, sixteenth chapter. The Doctor read with marked emphasis, dwell- ing particularly on the clause, " and when she was baptized and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have  judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there."  "What do you say to this statement, Mr. Wiseman?" asked the Doctor, triumphantly. "Notice it says, 'and when she was baptized and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me worthy.' Not one word about believing, and it appears that Lydia wp the only one to represent the house, in other words, the only adult-yet her household were baptized." "In reply to this,-your strongest case for 'inferential infants,' I would say, Doctor, there are many households without infants, Mr. Vernon's, for instance. Suppose they should all be baptized to-morrow, Mr. Vernon and his household-there would be a household baptism and not an infant included. We have no proof that Lydia was married,-no mention is made of her husband; if married, no proof of children at all-none being alluded to. But if she had, how can we prove that they were infants? Or even proving that there were infants in the household, does not prove they were baptized (although it might be justly inferred), but from the statement given by Luke, could not be proved. It is said that Elkanah and all his house went up to Shiloh to offer the yearly sacrifice unto the Lord. And yet we learn clearly from what follows that Hannah and the young child Samuel staid at home. I think, Doctor, the advocates of infant baptism will find     WQ/z     aEvangel Wiseman. it too difficult to manipulate an infant into Lydia's house- hold, to attempt it, after calmly weighing the obstacles to such supposition. And, furthermore, you will find, in the last verse of this chapter, that when ' Paul and Silas got out of prison they entered into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the 'brethren' they comforted them and departed.' And the context shows that the household of Lydia were the only persons baptized in Phil- ippi. They are called 'brethren,' and were 'comforted.' Now I argue, Doctor, if they could receive comfort, they could also believe, and thus, in this case, the order of Christ's commission, 'believe and be baptized,' was not set aside." "But, Mr. Wiseman, are there not many things our duty which are not expressly commanded in the Scriptures. and for which there is no definite example? Must we not, how- ever, as the growth of the Church develops new respon- sibilities, meet them and discharge them, although not strictly commanded or taught by example?" "Undoubtedly so, Doctor. But then we have no right to make laws for Christ's kingdom. He did that for Him- self when on earth. He commanded and instituted all that was necessary, and woe to' the man, or council of men, who dares to add thereto. This rite of infant bap- tism, so widely practiced, we have to-night demonstrated clearly has no Scriptural authority. It is a tradition, and we are expressly -warned against teaching for doctrine the traditions of men." "But you certainly do not think, Mr. Wiseman, that infant baptism does harm, do you?" "Incalculable evil, Doctor. With our Presbyterian friends it comes in the room of circumcision, which idea, I believe, you repudiate--and thus it engrafts Judaism on the   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.    273 Gospel, and introduces a fearful error, linking together the ceremonial law with the Gospel of free grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. It also leads to the belief of baptismal regeneration, ascribing to an act of man that great change which only the Holy Spirit can effect. It fills the nominal churches with unbelievers; leads those sprinkled in infancy , to suppose that in virtue of their baptism they are entitled to salvation; and thus deceived they die and are lost. It also creates great confusion in the ranks of its adherents, some believing it is for one object, some for another; some advocating that it rests on this ground, which others entirely repudiate; others contending that it is for this object, which some of their opponents assail with deter- mined zeal; and so the controversy is destined to go on until the practice is abandoned altogether." "But does it not serve to increase the membership of the churches, and is' it not a restraint on the conduct of those )  who have received it?" "It answers both of these ends, Doctor, doubtless, to the detriment of both churches and individuals, filling the one with chaff, and leading multitudes down to hell, deceived by false hopes." The Doctor was silenced. His last foothold was gone. He felt his position, and as an honest man must submit to his defeat. "I see, Mr. Wiseman, in a way I have not hitherto done, that you Baptists are consistent, and have much Scripture authority for your views. But I am a churchman, and as an obedient one shall practice what the Church teaches." "You, of course, must decide in this respect for yourself, Doctor. Here, I have prepared, and intended to offer it to you to-night, but our time will not allow, a compendium of Pedo-baptist witnesses against the doctrine of infant baptism. Also, an argument on the evils of the practice;     274       Evangel Wiseman.  if you wish, take them home and at your leisure examine them." The Doctor took them, and placing them in his coat pocket, rose to bid good evening. Mr. Wiseman insisted that he should remain longer, but he excused himself and left. It was an event never to be forgotten. How glad  he felt that it would never be made public  Evangel's scruples were all gone. To her, there was no authority in the Word of God making it her duty to have her babe baptized.' Miss Delia read the decision in the young mother's face. BUT VERNON SHOULD BE BAPTIZED  How could this be effected? This was the question which must be answered. And  the sleepless hours of the night revealed to Miss Delia the many difficulties that surrounded its accomplishment. The parents, she was convinced, would never consent unless a marvelous change should take place in their views., They clung to their "errors" with most willful pertinacity. To baptize the child without their knowledge was very  offensive to her sense of honor. But Vernon must be baptized. He might at any time  -be snatched away as Herbert had been; and then-oh! then--  The thought nerved her to increased anxiety to devise some plan whereby the object could be effected, and yet no wrong done. How  shall she find a solution of this most vexed question? Earnestly she asked herself again and again, H ow?" The morning hour found her asking, "How?" The next morning Fannie Cheney called at Mr. Wise- man's, to see if Lilly and Annie were going to attend Mr. Earle's meetings   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   275 She was very desirous to go. But never in her life hav- ing entered the walls of a Baptist church, and knowing none of the congregation intimately, she dared not venture alone. So, having heard from Mrs. Vernon, whom she met down street, that Lilly and Annie were at Mr. Wiseman's, she called by to see if they would not go with her on Sun- day evening. She would not venture to attend in the morning. The young ladies informed her that they proposed to accompany Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman to hear Mr. Earle's first sermon. Mr. Carlton would escort them. "Is he a Baptist?" asked Miss Cheney, eagerly. This we don't know," responded Annie Chiles, blush- ing. "We have endeavored in every way, except by a direct question, to ascertain; but are as uncertain as when we first met him," added Lilly. "I fear he is, though; he seems quite at home in their meetings, and speaks of this Mr. Earle, who is coming, in terms of the highest praise." "But did he commune last Sunday? I heard Mr. Wise- man say it was c communion Sabbath.'  "No, we did not stay. We didn't think of it, Annie, did we? We should have preferred to remain. But when Dr. Eaton dismissed the congregation, we passed out, and he with us. Brother and sister remained." Fannie was accompanied in her morning walk by William Nesbitt, who, being a young man of wealth and leisure, had nothing to do but attend to the ladies. He was partic- ularly impressed with Miss Mordaunt's charms, and since the pic-nic had called to see her every afternoon, presented her with bouquets of the rarest flowers, had taken her riding to see all the suburban beauties of Chester, and in every way possible manifested his deep and abiding interest in her. Mr. Nesbitt had won for himself the     276       Evangel Wzseman. sobriquet of "'fickle young man." He had in succes- sion devoted a week or two to each of half a dozen of Chester's most beautiful girls. His last flame had been Fannie Eaton. He admired her for her intelligence and fine conversational powers. Mr. Nesbitt appeared fickle, but the characteristic that caused him to be thus judged was enthusiasm.   He excessively admired anything that struck his attention, but he did not propose to waste his whole life on any one object, however interesting it might be to him for the time. He was also generous, so he would have felt direful corn- punctions of conscience to be found attending any one  young lady too long. He was determined all should share his society and enjoy his munificence, but he chose that they should doit in turn. This was his taste; why object to it? He was popular with all the girls, and deservedly so. Mr. Nesbitt was facetious; a little inclined to be wag-  gish; full of life which he could not restrain; with not too large a share of reverence, but overflowing with such ':kind-heartedness, that no one ever took offense. He made friends everywhere. He was a great favorite with Miss Delia, whom he often met in his visits to Mr. Wiseman's; and when she caught the tones of his voice from the parlor, she ran down stairs to see him. He sprang from his seat, clasped her hand with his usual fervor, and leading her to the sofa, sat beside her. "Why, Miss Delia, what is the matter? You don't look at all well this morning; you are quite distraught." And he gazed into her face with the most intense earnestness, as if the happiness of his whole after life were centered in her reply "Oh, Williel" (Miss Delia, having known him from his childhood, always addressed him by this abbreviated prenomen,) "I am distressed almost to death."   The Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   2" "Why, Miss Delia, is anybody dead?"And the young man seized her hand, and looked with the most searching interest right into Miss Vernon's face. "No, no; not that. But these people are wearing the life out of me, Willie, with their endless discussions, instead of doing what they ought to do, and what they know is right." ' I don't understand you. Who has been discussing, and what? The young ladies? What trouble have they that can'the settled?" "Oh, no I speak of this controversy about infant bap- tism, between Dr. Cheney and Herbert, that's been going on for weeks. I can't tell why people are so blind. It's because they won't see. Isn't it plain enough from the Bible that all the households were baptized? and hasn't the Church always taught that her children must be baptized? and what's the use of setting aside all this authority just to have one's own way?" "Why, Miss Delia, do you really thnk babies ought to be baptized?" "Most certainly I do " "Why! What good can it do them, Miss Delia? I never saw one of them baptized in my life, that it didn't make a fuss about it. I was baptized when I was a baby, but I don't see Iam any the better for it." "Don't you think it is taught in the Scriptures, Willie?"  "Well, really, I don't know, Miss Delia. I never found it there. But then, perhaps, I didn't look closely enough." The young ladies perceiving that Miss Delia was on her favorite theme, and that there was a little twinkl4 of fun in their young friend, left off conversation with themselves, and drew their chairs nearer the sofa. "Of course you didn't, Mr. Nesbitt," responded Fannie   v^.?     278       Evangel Wiseman. Cheney to this remark; "the Scriptures teach it every- where, and if you had desired to do so you would have found it." "You wouldn't say so, Fannie," interrupted Annie Chiles, if you had heard what Mr. Wiseman said last night."     ' "Pshaw!" ejaculated Miss Delia, "people can say a great many things. Proving is what I want." "But, aunty, I think brother did prove every position. Don't you, Annie?" asked Lilly with evident warmth. She was so happy to know that Herbert had not perished for want of baptism. And yet she believed in the rite because it was so beautiful! Annie nodded marked assent to Lilly's interrogatory. "Lilly Vernon, you don't know what you are saying. Didn't your brother admit there might be children in Lydia's household?" interposed Miss Delia, with fearful emphasis. "He said, I believe, that it might be inferred, aunty; that it could not be proved; and that, if she had children, no one could show that they were baptized." "Why, Lilly Vernon, are you turning Baptist, too? What is the matter with you that you talk so foolishly?" "I? No, I am not a Baptist, but a strict church-member. I was only repeating what brother said." '"It makes no difference what Herbert says. Everybody knows that households include babies, and that several households were baptized by the Apostles. Herbert even admitted that Lydia had children." "And she did, indeed, Miss Delia," interfered Willie Nesbitt, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "She had four -everybody knows, that-and all of them under twelve years of age. The eldest was Stephen, who was a good boy, with light hair and dark eyes; the next was Timothy, *   r        IThe Scriptures versus Infant Baptism.   279 "     a pretty wild chap, black hair, and eyes full of daring; and then came the two girls, Thyatira the elder, and Lydia the baby, and all of these were baptized because they were members of the household. I don't know how anybdoy can doubt after this." He spoke with the utmost gravity, while his face had taken upon it a look of the most expressive earnestness. Miss Delia, starting from her seat, exclaimed, "Where did you learn all this? Is this correct? -Who makes this statement'?" "' Nobody that I know of, Miss Delia. I thought if we could infer one baby,- we had just as well inferfour2 and give them names and ages, and the color of their hair, and have them all baptized at once. When we infer, I think we have a right to draw our own inferences, and this is my inference, and I am goig to stand by it." "Oh, you wicked, wicked boy!"And Miss Delia gave him a look of horrified reprobation. "How dare you sport so with religious things?" "Why, Miss Delia, I was only extending your 'inferen- :1ii   tial calculus.' You infer one or two babies; I infer four. Am- I not as reverential as yourself?" Miss Delia was silent. The young ladies could not for- bear a hearty laugh. The grave, quaint manner of Willie Nesbitt, added to his ridiculous description of the light and dark hair and eyes of Lydia's children, was too laughter-provoking; and notwithstanding Miss Delia's. midnight frown of rebuke, they were compelled to give vent to their merriment. It was ad captandum, but it had a weight that nothing else could; and in after years, whenever inference was mentioned in connection with household baptisms, all present thought of Lydia's four children with their dark and light hair and eves.     g280 '     Evanngel Wiseman. CHAPTER XVII. REV. MR. EARLE'S MEETING. T(E week was fast passing away. All Chester was in a state of anticipation for the coming Lord's day, for the fame of the Rev. Mr. Earle, as a most suc- cessful minister of the Gospel, had preceded him and awakened a high degree of expectancy in the minds of all. The discussion which had been going on for two weeks between Dr. Cheney and Mr. Wiseman, now generally  known to the two congregations, Episcopal and Baptist, and also to many of the friends of both parties, had greatly  served to heighten the interest in the approaching meeting. Both congregations regarded it somewhat in the light of  a test, with respect to several important personages in the community, and also to their respective weight for the future. Dr. Eaton and his large and influential church member- ship had been very active in making known to all classes of citizens the fact that the meeting was to be held. And it was realized by all that all would be welcome. Some had read the work of the Evangelist, "Bringing in  Sheaves"; and these were deeply impressed with the con- viction that he had attained to a state or degree of faith unknown to them. Some were believers in this "rest of faith," though deeply conscious they did not enjoy it. Others were skeptical; while others discarded the doctrine altogether. "Failing through unbelief to understand the promises, which are yea and amen in Christ Jesus," they could not appreciate the glorious heights of a faith that, *uld not appreciat   Rev. Mr. Earle's Meeting.      281 realizing the power and love of the Saviour, can take Him at His word when He says, "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name He will give it to you," and again-- "And all tihings whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believ- ing, ye shall receive."  How fearful it is to measure God's wisdom and goodness by the narrow and very imperfect standard of our own judgment; to attempt to reason, when Christ says, "only believe "; to doubt when He says, "Trust in me, I am thy strength"; to look to ourselves when He commands "Look unto me"; to rely upop our works for salvation when we hear Him exclaim, ' I am the way, the truth and the life"; to look to the world and the things of time for happiness, when our heritage is, "In this world ye shall have tribulation, but in me ye shall have peace." The very height of Christian attainment is to know the will of God, to believe without questioning what He tells us, and to do what He has commanded; with unwavering faith to lie down on the exceeding great and precious promises, and rest there. And when temptation comes, and deep waters of affliction shall rise about us, let us look up and exclaim, "It is written 'I will deliver thee. The waters shall not overflow thee. The Lord God Jehovah hath spoken, and He will make good all His promises."' If, because of doubts and fears, you ask: "How can this be?"I answer, "only believe." Christ Himself will do the work. Only trust. He is willing and able to give every needed good.  Up to ten o'clock, Saturday night, Mr. Earle had not reached town,-only one train more before eleven o'clock services on Sunday. "Will he be here in time?" was the question on many an anxious lip     tf  i     ^^wavUv w, -- V- Dr. Eaton's church held a prayer-meeting Saturday night. When the congregation dispersed, it was known the evan- gelist had not arrived. Some were disposed to doubt his coming, and feared that. the whole matter would prove a failure. Always some Thomases in every congregation. Men and women can't help this thing. It is constitutional with them. Dr. Eaton assured the audience that they need not dis- quiet themselves. He felt confident, from his knowledge of Mr. Earle's character, that he would certainly meet his engagement, unless some dreadful accident should befall him on his journey. But some of the sisters could not be convinced, and went home with despairing hearts. Some of the brethren, too, were exceedingly fearful, while others queried," Will he be able to preach, even if he shall come, getting in at five o'clock in the morning, after having traveled day and night all the way from Newton, Massachusetts?" "I tell you he will disappoint us, Doctor, said Brother B., addressing his pastor, " and then what will folks say, after we have made so much talk and raised such high expectations? It will be too bad, won't it?" Dr. Eaton was hopeful. But many a heart throbbed anxiously that night in. Chester, and many prayers were offered before the throne of God, that He would pour out His Holy Spirit upon the hearts of the people, and turn sinners to the Saviour. Sunday morning came. A large congregation assembled at an early hour in the Baptist church. There were in that audience members of all denominations in the place; and faces were recognized there that were but rarely seen in a religious body. It was evident that the very heart of the place was already stirred. The prayers of God's   Kev. lMr. S'arle's Meeting.     283 people were about to be answered, and His name glorified through the preaching of the truth as it is in Jesus. Our young friends, Lilly Vernon and Annie Chiles, were there. Mr. Carlton and Mr. Nesbitt sat beside them. All waited in anxious suspense, for it was known but to a few that the preacher had arrived. At ten minutes to eleven, Dr. Eaton, accompanied by a tall, well-developed man of about fifty years, passed down the aisle to the pulpit. It was the Rev. Mr. Earle. A whisper of gratification ran around the assembly. There stood before them the man of whom they had heard so much, and from whom they were now to receive the grand and sublime truths of the Gospel, in beautiful sim- plicity and convincing power. Every eye was bent on him. This he knew, for he had been in a like situation many times before, as he had traveled from Maine to New Orleans, and from the dash of the Atlantic wave, to stand beside the shore of the broad Pacific, everywhere proclaiming -to his fellow-men a free salvation through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. There was nothing about the man remarkably striking, as he stood and read to them a part of the gospel of Matthew; and many in the audience asked themselves, "What is the secret of his wondrous power? Why does he, more than other men, influence his listeners?" The sermon was plain, but powerful. Every one in that vast assembly gave earnest heed to the word spoken. The prayers were short, simple, earnest. It was a direct com- munion with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. All felt impressed with the conviction that he who made thanks- giving and supplication was sincerely in earnest. He felt himself in the presence of the Saviour, because he read the truth of the promise: "Where two or three are gathered     284       Evangel Wiseman. together in my name, there am I in "the midst of them." His Saviour was a felt Saviour. Though unseen, he knew He was there, because He had promised to be. And He spoke to him as friend speaketh to friend, and the Holy Spirit came and moved on the minds and hearts of the con- gregation, and led them to consider the truths spoken. There was not one in that audience that remained unim- pressed. Some were filled with emotion, others with fear; some with rejoicing, others with contrition. Some, who for years had been halting in the Christian life, looking at themselves to meet the requirements of the law, were led through this one discourse to look to Jesus, who was now revealed to them, "the end of the law to every one that believeth." There was much heart-searching, too; for the Word of God was quick and powerful, sharper than a two- edged sword; and sins hidden out of sight were brought before the bar of conscience, and men and women were made to cry out against themselves, " unclean, unclean!" Some who had come to make observations, " to see what manner of man this preacher was, and what kind of people Baptists were," went away feeling the weight of personal sin--went away to pray the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me a sinner." Everything was conducted in the most cheerful but quiet manner. People were made to feel that the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ was a religion of hope, of happiness; not something to be worn as a galling yoke, something you must have, not only to escape hell, but something that brought to its possessor not only peace, but joy; not only gave promise of the life to come, but of this life, making our pathway through the wilderness to the tomb, and through the tomb to the eternal blessedness above, radiant with all the light of heaven to all who walk as seeing Him who is invisible.   !j -         Rev., M r. Earle's Meeting.     285 Sad, doubting Christians do not recommend their relig- ion to others. The world asks, "Why are not Christians happy?"   The chief reason, I opine, is, that they fail to look to Jesus. Looking unto Him, the soul casts off its gloom and rejoices with exceeding great joy; for in Christ we behold "complete fullness." The afternoon services were largely attended. Mr. Wise- man endeavored to prevail on Miss Delia to accompany the family; but she would not, alleging that her care of Vernon prevented. But when he insisted' that Bridget Mahoney should take charge of the baby, she emphatically declined, on the score of opposition to "all such excitements." Annie and Lilly were more eager than in the morning, and Mr. and Mrs. Vernon, who had but on the occasion of Evangel's baptism been to the church, gladly accepted the invitation to hear the wonderful preacher. Dr. Cheney would have gone through curiosity, but the pride of apostolic succession kept him away. How could he turn aside from the dignified path of succession to listen to the Gospel from one on whom holy hands had not been laid in the line of " the Church," which Church was by the will of Henry VIII., of England, made to shoot off from the holy mother-church of Rome? Of ail pride in the world, religious pride is the most intolerant. Wonder if it is not the most intolerable in the eyes of Him who has said, "In honor prefer one another"? Mr. Nesbitt did not accompany the young ladiesfrom church. For the first time in his life his mind was perme- ated with the thought of his personal responsibility to his Maker--the question which the great Webster pronounced the most momentous that could engage the consideration of the mind of man.     286       Evangel Wiseman. The afternoon train from the East brought to Chester our party of Kentucky friends, Mr. and Miss Eugenia Robin- son, Mr. Beaumont and sister, Miss Isabella Lanier, and William, a younger brother of Mr. Wiseman. They had been detained on their route, so that instead of reaching Chester on Thursday, as they had proposed, they did not get in until Sunday afternoon. Mr. Wiseman hastened to his brother's, where he again met the friend of his boyhood, Mr. Carlton, and the young ladies, Miss Vernon and Annie Chiles. The other members of the party repaired to the hotel. It was the first visit that William had made his brother since his marriage, and of -course he was a stranger to the family. But he was kindly welcomed, even by Miss Delia, who was already informed that he was a Baptist. This she thought was as it should be, provided that "he should never propose to marry an Episcopalian girl." The subject, of course, was the meeting, whose influence was already felt by the community. "It is very opportune, indeed," remarked William Wise- man, addressing hi. brother, " that we should have reached here just at this particular time. I have always been desirous to hear the Rev. Mr. Earle, of whom I have so often heard; and then my young friends, Mr. and Miss Robinson, who are deeply impressed with Catholic views, although unwilling to confess it, may have their minds enlightened and their hearts changed." William Wiseman was unlike his brother in many respects. More ardent in disposition, more excitable, he -always spoke what he felt. Phrenologists would have said -he needed more " caution." But he was not at all impru. dent, only very open and frank. With broad, handsome -features, clear blue eyes and auburn hair, that was always   34 Rev. Mr. Earle's Meeting.              287 brushed back from a finely-formed forehead; complexion indicating good health, and a quick flow of blood, of a nervous-sanguine temperament, he always attracted those with whom he was thrown in contact. He was witty, too, but never sarcastic; pious, but no cant; strictly conscien- tious, but not at -all censorious. -He recommended his religion by right-doing himself rather than by attacking the defects of others. He looked to his own " beam" and left his neighbor's "mote" to be looked after by some one else. His last remark caught the ear of Annie Chiles, who had been sitting by the window listening to a conversation between Lilly Vernon, Miss Delia and Mr. Carlton, in which Miss Delia was inveighing in pretty strong terms against what she denominated " excitements," and reitera-     ting her previously expressed resolution not under any circumstances to attend the " big Baptist meeting," as she sneeringly called it. "Hearts changed!" repeated Annie Chiles to herself; "what does this mean,? Is anything necessary but to unite with a church and be confirmed or baptized?" The first thought fastened itself upon her mind, and she determined, the first opportunity, to ask Mrs. Wiseman what her Church meant by this. A seed had been sown by this seemingly casual remark of Mr. Wiseman, which should produce fruit in after years, whereby God would be highly honored. Christians should sow beside all waters.  God will make it to spring up in His own good time. His word shall not return unto him void. "But, Miss Vernon," replied Mr. Carlton to Miss Delia's assertion, "Is it just to condemn where you have not heard? You tell me you have never been in a Baptist church;     288       Evangel Wiseman. have never heard a Baptist preach, and do not know what they believe, only that they will not baptize their infants, and will plunge people under the water." "But I do not believe in religious excitements. We never have them in the--our church. And I can't see any good in them.' "This is not' excitement, Miss Vernon. Mr. Earle never produces what you denominate ' excitement.' He always preaches, in an earnest manner, the Gospel as he holds it, and calls upon the people to accept Christ, and to manifest it by some demonstration. Of course, there is always deep interest. Men and women feel that it is to them he preaches and presents the great truths of salvation, truths that each one is individually interested in., They must necessarily feel some excitement, some arousing, when the momentous subject of their soul's salvation and the claims of eternity are Urged upon their consideration. We may oftentimes, from a superficial knowledge of a subject, condemn that which, on a more intimate acquaintance, oure best judgment must approve." "Well, well, sir, everybody must think for himself. My mind is made up. I have no taste for ' big meetings,' and shall not attend this, even if the great Mr. Earle is the preacher. Some of these days, when I have time, I may go to hear Dr. Eaton. I rather like him, if he is a Baptist." "And, aunty, perhaps you would like Mr. Earle, if you should hear -him preach," interposed Lilly, desirous that her aunt should relent sufficiently to attend once, feeling that if she would lay aside her prejudices, and hear one sermon, she doubtless could be induced to go again. "No, Lilly, I have no fancy for strange doctrines." 17   I!         Rev. Mr. Earle's Meeting.      289 'But, aunty," interposed Mr. Wiseman, "Dr. Earle does not preach ' strange doctrines.'" "Yes, I know, Herbert; I know, of course, you do not think so. But I do. I shall hear nothing but the sin of baptizing babies, and the need of going under the water, ':   and all these fancies that you Baptists cling to, and I don't want to have my mind upset with such things. I have trouble enough at home,"-and she turned upon Mr. Wiseman a look full of meaning,--"without going to strange places to find it." All present involuntarily smiled at Miss Delia's repre- sentation of Baptist tenets. "You have strange views of our preaching, aunty; and, Xallow me to say, very erroneous ones. I presume if you should attend the whole series of Dr. Earle's meetings, you would not hear the two points you have specified once introduced." ilI "Oh pshaw, Herbert; what will he talk about, then?" H He will preach Christ the only hope of sinners; will tell the people that without faith in Him, they must perish. And the great truths of the Gospel he will earnestly and clearly present, and urge upon the minds and consciences of men. I assure you, you will hear nothing offensive to - you. Won't you go with us to-night?" "On one condition, Mr. Wiseman." All sat in breathless expectancy. That Miss Delia should consent on any condition was marvelous. / (' And what is that?" "Promise you will grant it." "I will, if within my power." "Then I will go, for you can do so if you will." "But name your condition." "That you will allow Vernon to be baptized. Come,     290       Evangel Wiseman. you have promised, and you cannot retreat. And I will go and hear your preacher to-night." And Miss Delia started to her feet and turned to leave the room. Mr. Wiseman endeavored to prevent her doing so, that he might explain himself. But she would not stay to listen. Feeling that she had the promise of the accomplishment of her most earnest purpose, she bounded up-stairs with an alacrity that was remarkable. Nor would she, during the evening, come from her room, but prepared herself at an early hour; and when the family set out for church she was there, ready to accompany them. It was no time for Mr. Wiseman to explain. It was an awkward predicament, but in it he must remain. No extrication now. A very unexpected turn in the moment- ous question. How will it evolve?   Lig/ht and  arkness--Joy and Sorrow.     291 -?an-          CHAPTER     XVIII. iUGHT AND DARKNESS-JOY AND SORROW. THE meeting-house was filled to overflowing. Sev- eral congregations in the town had closed their places- of worship, that the people might attend the preaching of this man of God, who, though strictly a , Baptist, preaching and practicing what Baptists believe, nevertheless can recognize as brethren in the Lord all who truly and sincerely love the Lord Jesus Christ. For the first time since the subject of Vernon's baptism had become a matter of controversy, Mr. Wiseman now felt himself in an awkward position respecting this ques- tion. He fully comprehended Miss Delia's ardent feelings; appreciated her honest desire to have the child sprinkled, that it might be eternally saved;--he knew with what tenacity she clung to what she believed to be right, and also with what pertinacity she pursued a purpose. And there she sat beside him in a Baptist meeting-house to hear a Baptist preacher, in order that- she might effect this dearest desire of her heart. Perhaps no other consid- eration could have induced   her to do this. He fully realized that now she felt she had a claim--one that could jnot be denied, and she would persistently urge it until her object was accomplished. How could he convince her that he had acted justly and honorably, and yet emphatically refuse, as he must do, to have Vernon sprinkled? This was a question which presented itself for solution, but which did not just now appear likely to be solved. Taking his view of the matter, it was easy enough.     292       -Evangel Wiseman. Taking: Miss Delia's view, it was impossible. Would he not have to cat the Gordian mknot? To convince Miss Delia, was an undertaking utterly hopeless. She would see the whole subject through her own medium, and nothing could in her present condition change her views. But could he allow the child to be sprinkled? Assuredly not. He dared not sacrifice a great principle for any consideration of expediency. Miss Delia's intention had always been to have the baby baptized. }From this purpose she had never swerved, amid all the opposition, all the controversy. To her this great duty was paramount to all duties, and let consequences come as they might, she would discharge it. Vernon's eternal happiness hung suspended on the faithful observ- ance of this rite, whereby he should be made {" a child of God, an heir with Christ, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." She had continued to hope that the parents would grant their consent. She was very desirous that this should be done. For this she had called in the assist- ance of Dr. Cheney. She knew it was Scriptural and authoritative, and she believed he could convince Mr. Wise- man that it was so. If this failed, she would try persua- sion; and if both failed, she would do it anyhow. She would take the matter into her own hands, assuming all the responsibility, entirely irrespective of the claims of the parents, and secure the child's eternal welfare- at the hazard of their displeasure.       J We can scarcely conceive of Miss Delia's happiness as she sat there beside Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman, and dwelt upon the glorious thought that her desire was at last granted. Herbert had consented--had promised that the baby should be baptized, and she had no fears with regard to Evangel. She, of course, would agree now.   e LgTt and Darkness-Joy and Sorrow.     293 Miss Delia had gone to church to be critical. She had made up her mind' not to be pleased. But as she sat there during the exercises, watching very narrowly all that was said and done, she could not but feel happy, despite her malevolent intentions, in the assurance that at last, after Oso much effort, so much opposition, she had, when she least expected, gained her point. She was so delighted she could not be censorious. And notwithstanding she made resolute effort to give undivided ear to the proceedings, her mind would leap over the inter- vening week, and dwell upon the glorious scene when, in view  of a vast assembly of admiring  and loving friends, Vernon should be brought forward, dressed in his elegant robe and becoming new cap, and there, in presence ij    of all, receive the holy rite of baptism from the hands of Dr. Cheney. Every feature of that triumphant occasion passed in succession before her mind; every point was arranged and re-arranged and dwelt upon, until the whole vision transaction stood out in living light before her charmed vision. Lilly and Annie Chiles, under any other circumstances, would have dwelt as Miss Delia did on the baby's baptism; for they had heard the pass between Miss Delia and Mr. Wiseman, and as the lady was actually sitting quietly beside them  in a  Baptist church, they, of course, concluded that the whole matter was now arranged, and "aunty" had at last triumphed.   But now other questions of a mingled nature ocdupied their minds-other feelings filled their hearts. Evangel gave   the matter but a passing thought. Her soul was imbued with the spirit of the  :-- occasion.           -  The deepest interest pervaded the thronged assembly. Men of the profoundest thought, as the youths of immature mind, were alike spell-bound.     294       JEvangel Wiseman. All eyes were riveted on the speaker. And each one listened as if he were alone addressed. Each mind had to accept or reject the plain and yet sublime truths, which the speaker presented in his simple yet earnest manner. Each one was compelled to feel his own individualism. Man's need of salvation; Christ the only salvation freely offered; the joy of believing; the availability of that joy and peace which are found alone in Christ-were all pre- sented calmly and assuringly, yet forcibly. Possessing this power, exerting such an influence over the minds of his whole auditory, it is a matter of no wonder to those who understand the philosophy of man's intellect- ual and spiritual being, that when, at the close of the sermon, to which were appended a few practical remarks, the speaker made the request that all who desired to be prayed for and with should manifest that desire by coming forward--that large numbers arose from  their seats without further urging, and quietly proceeded to the space around the pulpit, and knelt. Among the great number were Mr. Carlton, Willie Nesbitt, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Beaumont and his sister. Eugenia Robinson sat beside Annie Chiles and Lilly Vernon, apparently unmoved. Her face wore a look of stoicism, painful, under the circumstances, to behold. You would have pronounced her quietly defiant, and yet a close observer would have detected that a faint color came and went on her cheek. Annie and Lilly longed to join with the others in request for prayer, but Miss Delia's eye was fixed upon them, and they dared not move. "And then," thought Lilly to herself, " am not I a church-member and all safe? Why should I go to be prayed for?" Through Annie Chiles' mind was running continually, "A change of heart, a change of heart "I   :I /yLigyht and Darkness-Joy and Sorrow.           295 To Miss Delia, sitting bolt upright, the whole proceed- ing possessed a strange fascination.. She had never before -in all her life witnessed such a scene as the one before her. But she felt no responsibility resting on her. Like the little boy who, when asked on the occasion of a very solemn burial, "why he did not weep?" answered, "'Cause it's none of my funeral," so Miss Delia felt and acted respect- ing the meeting. She could not dislike Mr. Earle, "if he was a Baptist preacher." His appearance was so pleasant, his delivery so quiet, yet so earnest and      striking, that despite her determination to the contrary, she was forced to like him. There was nothing that she could term "excitement," and yet the people were deeply moved, their judgments were convinced, and their will aroused to action.  They felt, realized, that they were immortal beings; that they were also mortal, destined to live forever, yet liable at any moment to be ushered into the presence of the great Judge; that the question of their relationship to God who had formed them  was the momentous question, which must now  be settled for time and eternity, and they dared not delay; that there was no salvation but through Christ; and that prayer, the fervent, effectual prayer of God's people, avails inasmuch as Christ Himself commands that we shall ask, in order that we may receive. Believing these great truths, the people were willing, yea desirous, that supplications, earnest, united, should go up in their behalf before the throne of all grace. Certainly there was nothing extravagant, nothing delu- sive in this. To act according to the fundamental truths of God's plan of redemption, as revealed in the Divine Word, is the height of wisdom. Man could never have devised such a glorious way.     296       Evangel Wiseman. God himself has done so, and now through His ministers He presents it to the people, saying, all the day long, "Come unto Me and be ye saved." Turning to Christ is the only act of man which makes the angels rejoice. Then why should man delay, or be ashamed, to repent and be  saved? Carnality, bigotry and self-conceit, suggest many other ways of entering into the -kingdom of heaven; but this one so plain, so simple that the way-faring man, though a fool, shall not err- therein, and yet so sublimely glorious that none but God Himself could have conceived and con- summated it, is the only way. We must repent towards God, and exercise faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. What a " refuge of lies"Satan is constantly presenting to the unrepentant heart of man I How effectually he keeps them away from the truth with his never-ending devices. And they must eventually perish in that dread day of reckoning, when, deluded, they shall stand and say, "Have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many wonderful works?" And, oh I dreadful awakening I Christ shall say unto them, "I never knew ye; depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity." Let men believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, love Him, trust Him, then will His love constrain them; then will they work from proper motives, and His blessing attend their efforts. The mght's meeting produced the most startling effect throughout Chester. Various were the comments upon it, and the wonderful developments. That more than fifty persons among the number, some of the oldest and most reliable citizens of the place, should present themselves   d!"      ..Light and Darkness-Joy and Sorrow.    297 for prayer, was indeed a thrilling occurrence. The effect set    of Mr. Earle's three sermons was far greater than had ever before been known in the city. What agency but that of the Holy Spirit could have wrought such a result? God extension of the Redeemer's kingdom. Therefore, "'let men always pray and never faint." "And now, Herbert," said Miss Delia, as they reached the pavement, "Velmon shall be baptized. I have been to your meeting, and you dare noc say no." "Why, aunty, you surely cannot claim this at my hands!" replied Mr. Wiseman, with astonishment. "Assuredly you do not think I can set aside a great principle, for any reason short of honest conviction Individual belief as the basis of individual salvation is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Gospel. How dare I to question or set it aside?" "But, Herbert, you have promised. Surely you will not play me' false. I have complied with the terms of your- agreement, and you must do likewise." You mistook me, aunty; or rather would not wait for an explanation. You cannot believe I could consent to    i  have my child sprinkled when I believe it wrong, in order to induce you to attend a Baptist meeting? The terms were your own, to which I could not, dare not, nor will I ever consent, until I am convinced my present course if is unscriptural." "It is a plain business matter-one that involves your honor as a Christian gentleman. You cannot set aside your promise. I will not relieve you from'the engagement. I have met my part of the obligation, and shall hold you to yours; anrid if you do not comply with it, then you mus' take the consequences, that's all." "But, aunty, permit me to explain. I could not--"     298       EEvangel Mtiseman. "No earthly explanation can change the matter, Mro Wiseman. It is just as I have stated, and whether you wish to or not, you must stand to your agreement." "'Will you not hear a word of-" "No, no, that I can't; I'm not going to have any explana- tion-s-nor reasoning--nror logic. I want Vernon baptized. You promised me it should be, and I shall hold you rigidly to your word; rest assured of this. I'm not going to hunt the world over for people to explain your duty to you, nor persuade you to do it; but shall see to it that my duty is discharged. So good-night." And Miss Delia, with Annie Chiles and Lilly, accompanied by Mr. Carlton and Willie Nesbitt, turned down street towards Mr. Ver- nones, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman and their brother to their own reflections, as they walked homeward. It was Wednesday  The meetings increased each day in interest. The church was no longer able to hold the large night congregations, so the Masonic Hall, the most commodious audience room  in Chester, was secured. Many had already found peace in the exercise of faith in Christ. Many were earnestly seeking to learn the way of life. All denominations attended the night ser- vices. Even Dr. and Mrs. Cheney had been induced to be present, as it was in a Hall, and not a Baptist meet- ing-house. If electric wires had been established through- out the city, there could not have been a more general and sympathetic interest prevailing. Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman attended all the services, and also Lilly and Annie, and the Kentuckians. Miss 'Delia   Light and Darkness-Joy and Sorrow.     299 was never again present., No persuasion could induce her to go. Her head was filled with other considerations. "The leetle darlint ain't at all well, Mrs. Wiseman," said Bridget, hastening down the steps to admit her mistress, as the latter returned from the afternoon service on Wednes- day. "Miss Dayleah has been at the parson's all the blessed evening, and lef me in care of him; and the dar- lint has fretted and fretted a grate dale, I sure you maum." Evangel sprang up the steps, and throwing aside her bonnet and mantle took the baby from the cradle to exam- ine it. She asked no questions. She looked at it. It had fever and was stupid. Her heart sank within her. Thus had Herbert sickened.  If Vernon should go as he had done I She was terribly alarmed. "Run, Bridget I  Run for Dr. Rives; tell him to come instantly. My baby is sick-very sick," she repeated, as she placed her fingers on its bounding pulse. "Then go for Mr. Wiseman, or send for him, if you can see any one on the street who will go. Hasten; there is not a moment to lose! The mother was left alone. She knew not what to do. With no one to assist her, she could only bathe its little hands, and bend and pray, while her heart beat audibly and tears flowed down her sad face. Bridget had not long   been gone before Miss Delia came in. "What is the matter, Evangel?-" she exclaimed, as she entered the room and beheld the agonized mother bending over her child. "Vernon is sick, very sick, auntyl"And  Evangel looked up so imploringly into the face of Miss Vernon, who stood as if petrified. "'Do, aunty, bring me a little hot water, that I may bathe his feet; and then please do     300       Evangel Wiseman. run for Herbert! Bridget has gone for Dr. Rives, but she may not find him. See, he looks so like----"The words died out on her lips and she sobbed aloud. "I will go for Herbert, Evangel, and I will bring Dr. Cheney too. I tell you, this child shall not die without baptism. Herbert promised me he should be baptized." "Oh, aunty, dear aunty,( do run quicklyl I fear my child will die before they reach here l"Evangel shrieked as a slight convulsion passed over the little form. Miss Delia hastened on her errand. l;   g Deep Waters.        301 CHAPTER XIX. DEEP WATERS, Would'st know the way I've trod My journey up to God? 'Twas o'er a path thick set with sorrow Mid rayless night without a morrow; Until I heard Christ say, "EAVE ALL; I AM THE WAY." Believing, I my strivings ceased, And find in Him-the sweetest-peace. THNE arrows stick fast in me, and Thy hand presseth me sore," was the anguished exclama- tion of the tried Psalmist, as he sat bowed be- neath the overwhelming weight of affliction. What a sad, sad picture of poor helpless humanity, "which is crushed before the moth." "I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me," was the triumphant exclamation of the great Apostle, as his faith, fixed as the eternal hills, leaped over the bar- riers of persecution, distress, toil and disappointment, and laid hold on the strength of the Lord, mighty and able to save. The Psalmist's experience was that of Evangel Wiseman, as she sat that day with a mother's breaking heart, gazing yearningly on the form of her sick babe. Ahl there are trial-moments in life when the soul, cut loose from all her moorings, drifts helplessly, hopelessly, far out on the raging waves of dark uncertainty and overwhelm- ing fear I All is wild welter. No star to guide, no rudder, chart, nor compass. Despairingly we gaze on the fearful     302      -Evangel Wiseman. danger, listen to the rushing billows, hear the wild winds roar. Unnerved we view with dread indifference the fate that promises soon to engulf us, and feeling ourselves vic- tims of a dark and unrelenting destiny, we yield; no effort made to avert, no prayer sent up to the ear of Jehovah that He would deliverance bring, and lead us to the Rock higher than we! It was such a trial-moment to Evangel. No words can portray it. The language of earth is too meagre to express the deep sorrows of the immortal spirit within us. Nor is it necessary that it should be able to do so, for who would understand? No stranger can meddle with the heart's bitterness. In all the universe, only the God-Man can appreciate the depths of woe the human heart can feel. And to do this it behooved Him to be a "man of sorrows," acquainted with grief, "to be made perfect through sufferings," that He might be " touched with a feeling of our infirmities," might " succor those who are tempted," might ", bind up broken hearts,' and " turn sorrowing into joy." He knows the unspeakable depths of woe, for He descended into them, when sweating great drops of blood in the garden, He exclaimed: "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me." PWonderful scene! that midnight hour in Gethsemane! The mind faints with the effort to com- prehend it; and the redeemed soul can only say, "This was for me, that I nMght live." But, oh, glorious truthI the God-Man conquered-tri- umphed over sin and all its consequences-Satan and all 'his hosts-death, with all its horrors--the gloom of the grave-all--and rose victorious, the Captain of a perfect salvation, which He Himself brought in by His death.. An1, equally glorious assurance, He is our brother,   Deep Waters.        303 friend, who will never leave nor forsake us, but will, from every temptation, provide a way of escape, and in every sorrow will bestow " sufficient grace." Mothers, who with broken hearts have laid away sleep- ing babes for the great awakening-and then, ever looking at the little bed of the sleeper, with ears sealed by griefs dark hand to the voice of the Master who proclaims now, beside every pulseless form, as He did that "fourth day" at Bethany, to the questions of Martha, "I am the resur- rection and the life "-hearts throbbing with unspeakable bitterness, because the light of earth has been suddenly darkened, and the soul, in its gloom, will not look up to catch the dawnings of the heavenly day-these know tome- thing of the agony of Evangel, as she gazed on the fevered form of her precious Vernon, A mother's love I What heights, what depths unfathom- able! Next the lo^e of God Himself. Sacrificing every taste, every comfort, gladly living on through weary nights of watching and exhaustive days of painful anxiety, for- getful of self, existing only in the little helpless breathing form, which centers every pulsation of the mother's being I And well this is so. What- could meet the infinitude of demands on the whole existence, mental, moral, physical, but this undying, God-like principle of a woman's heart! The babe is the mother's idol, at whose shrine she pros- trates herself and ever adores! "' Deep waters," groaned Evangel, as she noticed every breathing, "u I shall certainly be overwhelmed I cannot stand this blow I. O, God, deliver me 1I Let not thine hand rest heavily on me, lest I perish with my grief!" Satan, too, was plying his fiercest darts. His voice of temptation said, "Why should God do this? Why again afflict so sorely? Had He not taken one idol? Why should     304       Evangel Wiseman. He demand another? Could He not be satisfied? Why did she deserve this fearful blow? Had she not striven to walk humbly before Him and do her whole duty? But, perchance, she had failed to discharge her dutyr Ah! might it not be that God was punishing her for her want of obedience, her neglect of the right? Ought she not to have had Vernon baptized? It could do no harm. Would it not honor God publicly to give her child to Him by outward sign?" These were the subtle suggestions of the Arch-fiend, and lile the first mother in the Garden, the perplexed soul of Evangel listened to them all. Vernon should be outwardly given to the Lord, and yet her heart beat rebelliously against His taking away what He had bestowed. Strange inconsistencyl Hlow weak are we when we walk by sight I If Dr. Cheney should not come, and Vernon should die  If Dr. Cheney should come and wish to baptize the child I Would her husband yield, or would he oppose? If he would not consent, how could it be effected? And if not done, might no. . .  She dared not follow the thought farther, Meanwhile the babe lay on her lap in unquiet slumber. Oh, how wearily the time passed!"Would no one come? Why did not Dr. Rives hasten on? It might be that some- thing could be done to save the child. Surely it would not die--her only one!" The fever increased, the breathing quickened, the fearful convulsions, which Evangel regarded as the sure precursors of speedy death, became more marked. The little one murmured in its pain. The mother was frantic. Everything was forgotten in the fear of death. Must her child die--die without   Deep   Waters.       305 an effort being made to save its life? Why did not Bridget Mahoney bring the Doctor? W!y did not some fiend come in? Must she remain there alone, alone and see her child suffer and die? She could not. She must call from the window to some one to come to her relief. She ] =52 I rose, and placing the little unconscious one gently on the bed, threw open the blind. Just then she heard the click of the gate, and the form of Dr. Rives appeared in the avenue, followed by Bridget Mahoney. She breathed less convulsively. Her spent strength could scarcely support her to the bed where Vernon lay. She bent over him without daring to disturb him. Without ceremony the physician entered and found his way to the room. The terrified  gaze of the mother- alarmed him as she looked up from her bending posture. She was a woman of such decision, so remarkable for self-control, that Dr. Rives, in witnessing her expression, feared that the little spirit had already fled.     Softly he approached the bed. A glance told him the child lived. Bending over it, he made a thorough exam- liB ination. Meanwhile Evangel stood as one expecting the announce. ment of a death sentence. In fearful suspense she awaited the statement of the Doctor's decision. He spoke not, but bent his ear close to the little form, from which he had gently,removed the covering. "Must Vernon die, Doctor? My darling child, my only one, tell me, must he die?" she gasped convulsively, as the doctor replaced the little blanket' and turned from the bed. "I think not, Mrs. Wiseman. The child is quite sick, Is '     t     306       Evangel Wiseman. but I see no very alarming symptoms. His disquiet is perhaps rather unfavorable," he added, as the little hands of the sleeper moved suddenly. "Doctor, do not deceive me, I beseech you!" the mother said, commanding her voice and nerving her soul to bear the worst. "Let me know the true condition of my child!  If he must die-" her heart ceased its beating as the words fell from her lips--" let me know it I am but little pre- pared for such an event, but if it must come, let me be apprised of it!" What an effort to utter these words! Her very being heaved in dreadful throes at the fearful thought. Vernon moaned-Evangel bent over him in tearless agony. How beautiful he looked with the fever-tinge upon his soft, white cheek, and the pure red lips faintly parted, while the innocence of heaven lay overspreading every feature I "Doctor, tell me truthfully what you think of my child's condition? Is there any hope?" "Assuredly there is, Mrs. Wiseman I really d o not think you need feel any apprehension from the present :symptoms. But you know that with children as young :as your babe, disease is so rapid and so variable, that a -truthful physician cannot always say what the result -will be." Ah how emphatic that word "result" sounded to her trembling soul! It was as though he had pronounced sentence of sure death for her babe. The physician seated himself beside the table and wrote a prescription, and handed it to Bridget Mahoney, who all this time had stood breathless within the door of the room. "I have ordered some medicine, Mrs. Wiseman," he   Deep Waters.         307 said in a cheerful voice, that he might by his manner, accomplish what his words had failed to do. "Give it to  him every two hours, and keep him perfectly quiet; every- thing depends on this. I think the fever is the result of cold, and as son as the system acts the child will be better. Nothing could re-assure the fearful heart of the anxious mother. She believed her babe would die, and that very soon. And with that conviction forcing itself on her soul, the only question that presented itself was, "Shall he not be baptized I , Dr. Rives would not leave the mother alone. Mr. Wise- man was momentarily expected. Also Miss Delia, and perhaps Dr.- Cheney. So, after looking at the child, who was resting in deep slumber, he seated himself and endeavored to divert the mother's mind from her dis- tracting thoughts. "In a few moments Miss Delia entered, followed by Dr. Cheney, who at her earnest solicitation had consented to accompany her. In her fright, she had represented the child in a dying condition, and also the willingness of the father that it should be baptized. Dr. Cheney at first demurred decidedly.  le could not understand Mr. Wise- man's sudden alleged change of views. And not wishing to make a faux-pas, though earnestly desiring to baptize the child, he replied-to Miss Delia's entreaty: "Indeed, Miss Delia, I do not feel that under the circum- stances of the past week, it would be proper for me to accompany you with a view of baptizing the child." "I do assure you, Doctor, Miss Delia replied, her tone and look marked by the most earnest entreaty, " that Mr. Wiseman consented-did so before the babe was taken sick; and now that it is about to die, I am sure he will not object."'     308       Evangel Wiseman. "And do you think the babe is so ill, Miss Delia? May you not be mistaken?" "He is very ill indeed, Doctor, just like dear little Herbert; and I fear, like him he will be taken from us. And should he dte without baptism, I tell you I could not live. Oh, how dreadful it would bel I tell you, Doctor, you must come. There is no time to be lost."      :3 "Did Mr. Wiseman -know your intention, Miss Delia?  i Did he consent to your coming for me?" asked the Doctor,  yet unconvinced of the propriety of the step.-  "Oh, HerbertI He was not at home when I left. The   baby was taken sick so suddenly and so violently I could : not wait until he came from the office." ' The Doctor, who was beginning to entertain a thought . of acceding to Miss Vernon's request, was made to desist A again by this reply of hers. Re-seating himself by the : table, from which position he had arisen to get his hat arid  cane, and knitting his brow in thought, he remained silent. It was evident he was quite perplexed. Had he not so  : fully known Mr. Wiseman's views and his staunch adhe- rence to principle,- he might have yielded without question- ing. But as the case presented itself, without a direct request from him, it would not only appear, but would really be, an act of intrusion scarcely pardonable. And yet the child ought to be baptized, if it was really as Miss Delia represented it-in a dying condition. "Come, Doctor, do there is no time to be lost!"Miss Vernon said, most imploringly. "You need not fear but 'twill all be right, for I do assure you that Herbert on last Sunday consented to have the child baptized." How could the Doctor question Miss Delias repeated asseveration? And yet how could he believe that Mr. Wiseman, without a cause, had yielded a point to which   -       .Deep Waters.        309 he had so tenaciously adhered, an in support of which he had adduced such convincing proof? The Doctor was in a dilemma. How could he relieve himself of the diffi- culty? Never in his life-long experience had he been similarly situated. It was a gordian knot which he could neither untie nor dared cut. Miss Delia's solicitude and fear increased every moment. The thought that Vernon should die unbaptized was driving "Come, Doctor, do   come! we must be quick!" she besought, rising from her seat and looking upon him most imploringly.  "Think how dreadful it would be if we should find  the little darling dead when we get there! I tell you there is no time to be lostl Do come, "', The Doctor rose from his chair and accompanied Miss Delia to the" study door. Pausing there, he asked what Mrs. Wiseman had said. "Oh, Evangel told me to bring you. I tell youthechild must die, and it must be baptized before it dies. You have not a  moment to spare. Do come!" ' Did she request you to come for me, Miss Delia?" The Doctor felt that if so, he would at least be excused for going, even if Mr. Wiseman did not de sire the child baptized. "Y  es, yes, she did. She was so overwhelmed with grief, I did not wait for her to say anything more. She has never been opposed to Vernon's baptism. She only thinks what Herbert thinks, but throws all the responsi- bility on him. I told her I would bring you, and I know she is anxiously  waiting for you to come. Poor dear girl, it   is such a trial for her I! If the, little one should be taken, I  do not see how she will survive its loss " "Do you really think, Miss Delia, there is any hope of     310       ivanget vv 6ow- .. the child's recovery?" the Doctor asked a second time, as he stood hat and cane in hand. If he could but post- pone the visit until he could gain some more defnite information with regard to Mr. Wiseman's wishes, then he could act with more matured judgment, and more in accordance with the dignity of his position.  "The child is as sick as it can be, Doctor. I believe it will die, and that very soon; and I do beseech you to come with me. We dare not delay lest it be too late!  Too late!"Miss Delia repeated, in the saddest tone, as the  picture of the little one lost presented itself to her excited imagination.  "I would not, Miss Delia, seem derelict i discharge of duty. Could I deem it consonant with the wishes of our friends, would I most gladly hasten to the performance of what is ever to me a most pleasing ceremony-the dedica- iton of the young pure soul to God in holy rite of baptism.  But I hesitate now, I do assure you, lest I should intrude  where my services are not desired." "I tell you, Doctor, that you must not delay to go. It is your solemn duty. I claim it at your hands, and cannot take a denial. Why should you hesitate? Have I not convinced you that Herbert is willing, and that the child is in danger of death?" "S Suppose I wait until you return, and then, if desired, I can come immediately on the summons of a messenger. Miss Delia was horrified at the Doctor's proposition. Turning squarely upon him, she said: "Dr. Cheney, dare you refuse to go? Dare you shrink from your duty as a minister of the Church?" The Doctor saw the position. This appeal effected what her entreaty and all her reasoning had failed to do. And the Doctor put on his hat, and descending the steps set out   Deep  Waters.        3" with Miss Vernon, Who walked at such a rapid pace, it was almost impossible for him to maintain his position by her side. "Will Mr. Wiseman be at home when we reach there?" "Oh, I suppose he will. The girl was sent for him before I left, and if she found him in his office, he is already there." The Doctor was silent for the remainder of the walk. He was endeavoring to solve the mystery, and to avoid being placed in a false and awkward position. He felt that Miss Delia's enthusiasm had perhaps biased her judg- ment, and that if Mr. Wiseman had consented for Vernon to be baptized, it was on such conditions that could not be met. The two reached the house. Dr. Cheney remained in the parlor, while Miss Delia ascended to- the sick chamber. The mother was bending over the convulsed form of her child, her heart breaking. Bridget Mahoney stood beside her, terrified. Mr. Wiseman had not come. Bridget had not found him in his office, nor could Mr. Caldwell, the young man studying law with Mr. Wiseman, tell where he had gone. So leaving word for him to come home as soon as he returned, the faithful Irish girl hastened back to the relief of the mother. '. How is Vernon, Evangel?"Miss Delia asked, as she hurriedly threw aside her bonnet and parasol. The mother could not speak. Anguish had sealed her lips. She looked up with an expression of unspeakable sorrow on her face, and slowly'shaking her head, turned her fixed gaze on the face of her babe. "Where is Herbert?"Miss Delia asked of Bridget. "Couldn't find him, marm, at all, nor at all. Not in his offis, and Misther Kilwell couldn't tell me where he was li, replied the affrighted girl in a whisper. / .     312       Evangel Wiseman.              -a ", Has Dr. Rives heen here?"               ; "Yes, marm; and he is now gone for the medicine,     ii no one else.

"Oh, he said, aunty, there was no danger, but I know  , he is mistaken. These spasms are so fearfull I am sure   j my child will die!" "Oh, I trust not, Evangel," Miss Delia said, kindly endeavoring to console the distracted mother, though her fears of his condition were as great as those of Evangel. ! "I brought Dr. Cheney with me, dear. Shall I ask     j him up?"                    " X Evangel nodded assent, while the pent-up tears for the first time found vent. - The Doctor was introdueed into the room. Everything   vi tended to confirm Miss Delia's statement of the condition of the child. Miss Delia had told him in the parlor of her .. fearful apprehensions. Dr. Cheney approached the mother and child, and in words of beautiful sympathy, expressed his sorrow. Then taking a seat near the window, he waited for further dem-  onstrations.  It was evident to him that Mr. Wiseman was not in.   i Perhaps he had gone for medicine. Under no circum-  stances, save those of immediate death, would he baptize l the babe in the absence of the expected father.     l In a few minutes Dr. Rives, not finding any one atthe drug-store by whom to send the medicine, kindly returned with it himself. He found the child worse, decidedly so. The short time he was absent had wrought quite a change. He looked at it in -silence,. Evangel understood it all.               J   Deep  Waters.        313 "How is Vernon, Doctor?" asked Miss Delia, looking searchingly into the face of the physician, as if she would read his inmost soul. "He is quite sick, Miss Delia," replied the physician, "(but, I trust, not dangerously so. I think this medicine will give him relief. He must be kept wholly undis- turbed." "It can't do him any harm, Doctor, to baptize him, can it? Life or death he ought to be baptized, and that without delay." "Oh, no, I think not, possibly. But let it be done as quickly as you can." Dr. Cheney approaching Evangel, leaned gently over her and asked!" if it was her desire he should baptize the child." How could she consent? What a moment- of conflict between fear and early teaching on the one side, and clear decision made when the reason' was not guided by the emotions, on the other? She knew not what to say. Her feelings answered "yes," because her faith had not yet fully triumphed over her early bias. Her judgment and respect for her husband said " no," emphatically "no;" but emotion was stronger than judgment, and with the preponderance in favor of the baptism, she replied, "Wait, Doctor, until Herbert comes." The room was hushed to death-like silence. Re-seating himself beside the window, Dr. Cheney bowed his face in his hands to think. Moments were as hours to the overwrought soul of the mother as she awaited, in indefinable dread, the return of her husband. She looked upon her child in his fever and tried to pray. She desired most earnestly to do the right. But how could she decide in this deep trial what washer fl     314       Evangel Wiseman. duty? She believed Vernon would die; and as she con- templated the dread event she endeavored to bring her will into subjection, so that she might say, "He is the  * Lord, let Him do what seemeth to Him just." But oh! I how humanity triumphs over the God-like within us when its laws are in active exercise! The Apostle understood  : the conflict. How truly he describes the "warring" between the "law of the flesh" and "the law of the     l mind"l  The evening was transcendently lovely. The very air   a breathed heaven, and the glorious sunshine and smiling flowers and trees made jocund, as the caressing breezes swept through the laughing leaves;,-all served to take possession of the soul and bear it away to higher and   A holier climes,                      , But earth had no beauty now to the tortured soul and   Z tried faith of the weeping mother. There wass no conso- lation 'for her in, all the universe, because she beheld but j one object-her babe-who was just ready to leave her to go, "where, oh, where!"  She tried to pray, but thoughts died out, words could not be uttered. She endeavored to look up, but the eye  ! of faith was blinded by sorrow. Fain would she have    J turned to -human sympathy for one gleam of consolation, but what can human love avail when the soul has to deal with death!  Oh, the conflict endured by man when hope is extinct, and the horrors of the pit rise up to fill the soul I "Leave me not, nor forsake me, oh, God!" must eveD be the cry from the depths of this indescribable woe. Every experienced Christian has felt it,-can attest itsX truth. The people of God, in all ages, have had fellowship with Jesus when in the depths of woe He exclaimtned,   Deep Waters.     ,    315 "Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me." And then, as the divine triumphs, and faith, lifting up her bowed head, looks on the promises and reads them there as they are sealed, yea, and Amen in Christ Jesus our Lord, the soul whispers faintly, "not my will but thine be done." nd as faith goes on from strength to strength, she exclaims, "I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me." How significant, how mysterious the great revealed truth that the Son of God came into the world to die and yet, when the hour had come, we find Him pros- trate, praying that, if possible, the cup of death might be removed! Great and glorious paradox  We canot un- derstand it now; it remains among the secret things to be made manifest when we, 'having been partakers of Christ's sufferings," shall also be made glad with exceeding joy when His glory shall be revealed." Till then let us wait, ever bearing it in mind for our instruction and consolation, inasmuch as it proves the close alliance of the Saviour's divinity with our humanity. We see, that although Jesus came into the world to die-that this was His purpose, formed before the world was made, and cherished through all the ages,-and then when the time was well nigh come we see Him leaving Galilee and going up to Jerusalem to accomplish this grand purpose,-yet we find Him shrinking in dread from the ordeal. This was the Father's determinate will and council; this was the Son's inflexible purpose--"for this came He into the world." But behold Him in the garden of Gethsemane on that fear- ful night' of betrayal that preceded His death. See Him in the darkness, prostrate on the ground in agony, sweating "great drops, as it were, of blood, falling down to the ground," and hear Him as He utters the significant words,     316       - Evangel Wiseman.  Oh! my Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me." The cup was very bitter; how bitter only the God- Man could know. Behold Him in his feebleness.  How helpless He seems through mental suffering. God, the Father, hears the wailing cry. But the cup' cannot be removed. Justice is inflexible; it must be met. And the suffering Saviour of the world must be ministered to, as after His temptation in the wilderness. An angel is sent from the eternal throne; down, down through the unmeasured spaces he comes, until his wings are folded over the agonized form of Jesus, lying there in the soli- tude of the garden. "The angel strengthened Him." Wondrous act! The uncreated strengthened by the crea- ted. It must have been a message from  the Father, who, in this solemn trial-hour, was still well pleased with His beloved Son; a message of promise, the fulfillment of which shall be the bliss and glory of the redeemed throughout eternity. Wondrous scene! inexplicable mys-    i tery And yet, how the tried soul turns to it for consola- tion He' who had power to rescue a world from woe was exceeding sorrowful 4' even unto death."    ! Evangel tried to pray, but her feelings were too confused., l The conflict was severe; it rent her very soul. Is there no eye to pity? Is there no arm to save? Will no relief   i come? Can relief come to a heart so tried?          The babe lay quietly sleeping; but its breathing had become more hurried and the fever flush had deepened. 'Dr. Rives endeavored to assure the mother's mind that  her child was no worse, but she cauld not give credence to his statement. Repeating his directions, and insisting on the most perfect quiet, he left, promising to call after tea. Miss Delia made every effort to compose herself and   Deep Waters.         317 await the return of Mr. Wiseman, but so fully did she believe that the child might die at any time on the recur- rence of a spasm, that she could not remain quiet. She descended to the dining-room and arranged, as best she could, the preliminaries for the baptism, which she was determined should take place before Dr. Cheney left the house. The Doctor maintained his position by the window, feeling most decidedly uncomfortable as he surveyed the situation and calculated the results of the present move- ment. Nothing but the plea of Miss Delia-"Dr. Cheney, do you dare shrink from your duty as a minister of the Church"--could have influenced him to the step that led to his anomalous position. It was humiliating in the extreme, but unavoidable. Had there been' the least reasonable ground for expecting that Mr. Wiseman would yield to Miss Delias purpose, he wouldgladly have been, subjected to any degree of mortification that the desired end might be accomplished. He sincerely wished to bap- tize the babe. He believed it was his duty to have it done, and then in the light of influence, and triumph for truth, it would be an event of the greatest moment. But there was a share of honor involved which he could not ignore, atd which bound him to await the coming of the father, and to abide by his decision. Miss Delia returned from  below, and seating herself by the cradle, fixed a sad gaze upon the little sufferer. Just then the babe moaned, and partly opening its eyes, manifested all the premonitions of a spasm. She could be silent no longer. Springing to her feet, she stepped to Dr. Cheney's side and said, in an undertone of deepest earnestness, while her look bespoke the terror of her soul:     318       Evangel Wiseman. "I tell you, Dr. Cheney, the child must be baptized- it is wrong, it is sinful to- put it off. Look at him now! See how he twitches! He may have a spasm at any moment. Oh, I beg of you to baptize him now I Every- thing is ready-an hour and it may be forever too late I " Evangel spoke not. She sat like one transfixed, gazing down upon the restless babe. "Say, Doctor, will: you delay when death is at the door?"Miss Vernon added in a most impassioned voice, as Dr. Cheney seemed to hesitate; "I beseech you in the name of the Saviour, in the name of the Church, to do it, and that immediately. It must be done. I shall do it myself rather than the precious one shall die and be lost I Will you do it?"       - "Most gladly, Miss Delia, under any other circumstances. :I But as it appears to me now, I dare not do it hastily. We must await the coming of Mr. Wiseman. and his decision.  g I assure you I am as desirous as yourself to have it done, but as Mr. Wiseman will soon be in, we must wait." At this juncture, Bridget Mahoney entered the room with a bowl of water. Hearing the last words. of lffiss Vernon's imperfectly, she added: "Do, Doctor, in the name of the Holy Virgin and all -the saynts, I do besache ye to baptize the darlint."  "But, Doctor, the child may die before Herbert returns. Another spasm may take him off, and then, oh, taen--" :and Miss Delia shuddered at the dreadful thought. "How much better to risk all the consequences of baptism than those of its neglect. I do beseech you, Doctor, to wait no longer!" Just then the door-bell rang, and voices were heard :in the hall. Miss Vernon descended to enjoin quiet.   Deep   Waters   .      319 Half way up the stairway she encountered Lilly, who, having seated her friends in the parlor, was hastening to her sister's room, wholly unapprised of the fearful scene it presented. "Be quiet, Lilly," Miss Delia said softly, as she took the arm of the blooming, joyous girl. "Vernon is very i   ill: we fear he may die." The girl blanched as white as marble. Shocked at the suddenness of the dreadful intelligence she clung to her aunt, unable to utter a word. "Dr. Cheney is here to baptize him." Lilly was ready to shriek with terror. Her precious little treasure that she so loved, that was to her priceless above everything on earth, must die! No, no iit could not be. She could not give him up. "Let me see him, aunty! Oh, let me seem him!" she implored in broken accents. "You must control yourself, dear. Dr. Rives says every- thing depends 'on his being kept quiet. He appears uncon- cious, but any noise may throw him into a convulsion. Go softly. With breaking heart Lilly reached the room, and ap- proaching  the cradle where the babe lay, fell on her knees beside it, while her whole frame trembled with suppressed emotion. Mrs. Wiseman could no longer control herself. This act of Lilly's unsealed the fountain of tears, and bursting into a fit of weeping, she turned and sought the hall. It was the first moment of anything like relief that had come to her agonized soul. How blessed, that we  can weepl Miss Delia' descended to the parlor, where she found a  number of young ladies and gentlemen,-Annie Chiles,     320       Evangel Wiseman. Fannie Cheney, Fannie Eaton, Willie Nesbitt, young Mr. Carlton, young Mr. Wiseman, and several others of the party from Kentucky, who, in taking an evening walk through the suburbs, had called in with Lilly for a rest. Miss Delia, in a few words, explained the illness of Vernon. The party proposed to leave, but she insisted  h that they should remain until after the. baptism. Enjoining ? quiet, and urging that they stay and witness the holy sacrament, she added as she left the room, "You will not have to remain long. Just as soon as Mr. Wiseman returns, Dr. Cheney will baptize him, and we are looking ; for Herbert every moment. I will inform you when all things are ready. Enjoy yourself as best you can, only be very quiet."-  Stealing up to the room, Miss Delia proceeded cautiously to adjust and prepare everything necessary for the expected ceremony. Soon Mr. Wiseman returned.  It was a painful sur- prise to him, to find the child he had left in apparent health in the morning, now stricken down even to the very door of death. As he entered the room and encoun- tered Dr. Cheney, the whole subject flashed clearly before  his mind. He beheld the preparations and understood, from the circumstances, that they were only waiting his arrival.                    - It was a trial-moment to the father; it was also a moment of embarrassment to Dr. Cheney. Vainly did the Bishop, by closely scanning look and manner, endeavor to read Mr. Wiseman's will. Miss Delia, all anxious to have the matter at once decided, scarcely knew what step first to take. Evangel's mind was filled with the thoughts of her child's death-the question of its baptism she left to her husband.   Deep  Waters.        321 Mr. Wiseman examined his babe carefully. His judg- ment was very reliable. He found him ill. All sat in silence, unbroken, save by the suppressed sobs of the mother, the fountain of whose tears was stirred afresh by the presence of her husband. "Vernon is very ill; don't you think so, Herbert?" said Miss Delia, softly, as she stood beside the father. "Yes, aunty, he is very sick," was the quiet reply. "I thought' he would die, Herbert, so I sent for Dr. Cheney to baptize him, and the Doctor is -here to do it." The husband looked at his wife and then at the babe, and said nothing. Lilly gasped for breath. Miss Delia held her breath in fearful suspense. He did not consent. What would he do? "And I have made all things ready, for I felt there was no time to spare. Shall the Doctor proceed, Herbert? It will not do to delay. I will run down to the parlor and let the friends come quietly up." "Not now, aunty." Mr. Wiseman spoke in a low, firm tone. Miss Delia turned and looked upon him with an expres- sion of the most indescribable surprise and horror. He was standing by the cradle of the child, his arm around Evangel's waist. Lilly was kneeling at their feet with earnest gaze bent on the breathing form. The father closed his eyes as he spoke to Miss Delia. Tlhe Father above heard the silent prayer, "Lord help me." Dr. Cheney sat in very great agitation.  Could it be possible that under the present solemn circumstances, Mr. Wiseman would refuse to give his dying babe to Christ in baptism? Could it be possible he would let prejudice control him thus far? Surely, surely he would not. 20     322       Evangel Wiseman. Bridget Mahoney muttered prayers to the Virgin Mary, as she gazed with streaming eyes on the sad group. At length she ventured to say: "Do, Master Herbert. Let the dear leetle darlint be baptized. Be shure it will save his sowl." "Oh, brother, let Dr. Cheney baptize Vernonl" gasped Lilly, clinging to his knees." Evangel turned upon him an imploring gaze. He fully understood it. His strong heart gave way before the look of his idolized wife. What a fiery trial t Could one greater be imagined? Which shall triumph now, principle, or a husband's love? ' Passing through the deep waters, they shall not over- flow thee." Did he not need to stay himself on that promise now? What if faith should fail hm? What if he should decide to walk by sight? Sore temptation! How much he needed to remember Jesus the Great'Exemplar, who met the buffet- ings of the enemy with, "It is written, thou shalt not tempt i the Lord thy God." ' Let us not do evil, that good may ! come;" but ever remember that what is necessary for our i guidance "is written." In God's own revelation to man  A He has given all that He, from before the foundation of the world, saw it was needful to require, for faith and for practice, And instead of the " why ' and 4 wherefore" of doubt, let faith ever triumph exclaiming, "It is written."  God has never done a work of supererogation. Nor has   He ever left undone anything that is for the good of His v v ereatures. Christ's kingdom should be governed by His laws alone. Having instituted His own ordinances, we   dare not add thereto, lest we be found attempting to show ourselves wiser than the Master. "Let him be baptized, Herbert, before it is too late!    Deep  Waters.         323 Remember our poor dear little one, who is gone. It can't hurt the child. Dr. Cheney is waiting to administer the a'ii sacrament." Miss Delia spoke impetuously and imperatively. Every nerve in her frame shook violently. She could not let the child die without baptism. Her frantic look was fearful to behold. She was driven to the verge of des- iail peration by Mr. Wiseman's seeming obstinacy. Lilly again besought him with tearful eyes and choking voice. Evangel looked so sadly and imploringly upon him that gIl  his manly heart throbbed with anguish, as he read and sympathized with her deep distress. Bending his mouth to her ear, he whispered tenderly: "Our darling needs nothing to fit him for heaven but gIi the blood of the Saviour. No ordinance possesses saving power. We will trust him in the hands of our Lord Jesus, X  whose blood has made atonement for him." She bowed her head in beautiful assent. Faith was beginning to claim victory over doubt. Then turning to Dr. Cheney, Mr. Wiseman said: "I   am  sorry, Doctor, that this has occurred. It is unpleasant to you and to me; but no one is to be censured. All have acted in good faith. As unfortunate as the occur- rence is, and as much as I desire to save the feelings of all, I cannot forego what I firmly believe to be right. I dare not do it." The words were few, but enough. The Bishop under- stood them, and bowed a silent assent. He could not interpose an argument. Miss Delia was speechless. Evangel leaned trustingly on her husband. Lilly could urge no farther plea. Bridget repeated her prayers with redoubled earnestness, and looked very reproachfully at Mr. Wiseman.     324       Evangel Wiseman. Meanwhile, the party remaining below were surprised to see Dr. Cheney descend the stairway and pass quickly out. Miss Delia approached the window, and looking on the retreating form of the Bishop, said to herself!"' If he lives through the night, I will see that he is baptized. He shall not die without it. This I am determined upon."      ^ Will the angel of death come before morning?        The parents bow in mute grief, and await the issue.   ! i s '.               ,., j   Miss Delia's Decision.      a 325 CHAPTER XX. MSS DELIA'S DECISION-MR. EARLE'S MEETING. i O H, the anxious watchings of that long and fearful Xnight, when the wing of the Death Angel swept the very door of "Our Home."    Anxious friends sat in silent, groups through the still house. No entreaty could prevail on the mother to leave the couch of her child. Nerved, as by an invisible power for the ordeal, she sat beside the little bed, her eyes bent intensely on the unconscious form, or when necessary, min- istering with gentlest care to his wants, not for a moment giving place to any one. Miss Delia would also watch. She felt quite convinced that Vernon would die before the morning, and she was determined that, let come what might, she would herself baptize the child, before it should go. She made all necessary provision to this end, and fixing her purpose, resolutely awaited the development of events. Not wishing to annoy Mr. Wiseman in his deep sorrow, 1 she proposed to herself to wait until he should retire to snatch a short respite, and then, either by prevailing on iEangel to lie down or to be quiet, she would, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, administer the rite. But she dreaded to do it; the more she dwelt on the con- templated step, the more momentous it appeared to her. Not that she feared Mr. Wiseman's reproof or displeasure, but she regarded the 'movement as involving such grave responsibilities that she shrunk from it with trembling     326       Evangel Wiseman.             irresolution. Would the child be saved-could it be, if  not baptized by a minister? This was the question that  awed her soul and filled it with indefinable dread.    About five o'clock, Bridget called Miss Delia aside and  proposed that she should bring the priest.        "Shure an' I know Father Ryan will come, Miss Day- leah. Jist say I may, an' I'll bring him here in less than i an hour. The darlint should be baptized, that's shure, if  he be goin' to die. For in faith, we want to send him   to heaven, right straight, not to let him go down to pur-  gatory."                        i The temptation was strong to Miss Delia, for the choice  lay between the offices of Priest Ryan and her own, as 1 it was evident to her mind that, under the circumstances, Dr. Cheney could not be induced to come again for the  i purpose.     ,                   "Do you think your priest would come, Bridget, if he  knew all the circumstances?' Miss Delia asked thought-  fully. , Axn' I know, an' be shure he would, Miss Dayleah. : Father Ryan always goes whenever he is asked, for he  says it is his very business to do all he can for the church. X Let me run jist now, Miss Dayleah, I ain't a bit afraid.  The Holy Virgin will be shure to take care of me."    Miss Vernon bent her head in thought. What should  she do-what was best to be done? If the priest were  introduced it would be far more objectionable than if Dr. Cheney were to perform the rite. And then, would there be more promise of the child's salvation if a Catholic priest should officiate, than if she should do it herself?  Then it would be such a subject for gossip for weeks  to come, and would show, too, the desperate straits to which she was driven in order to accomplish her design, that she decided against the proposed step.    Miss Delia's Decision.      327 "I believe not, Bridget," she said, after thus reasoning within herself. "I am very much obliged to you, but, perhaps, it will be better not to send for the priest. In a case of emergency like this, I am sure my services will be accepted." "An' who will baptize the little darlint, be shure, if he should come to die?" asked Bridget vehemently, not comprehending Miss Vernon's remark. "Oh, Miss Day- leah, we must not let him go like the other little one. -I tell you, it is dredful, dredful, Miss Dayleah!" "I must do it, Bridget. I must trust in God and do it myself. This is all that can be done." Mrs. Vernon and Lilly insisted that Miss Delia should rest. But she avowed her desire and intention to attend the bedside of the precious babe as long as it might live, Dr. Rives had called just at nightfall, and informed the parents that there was encouraging hope for the child, though quite sick; and assured them that, unless some great and unforeseen change should occur, the child would certainly live through the night. But Evangel's hope was gone. She could not have faith enough to believe what the Doctor asserted. Her silent prayer was that God would give her strength to meet the dread stroke as a Christian, that she might honor His name; and would grant to show her her duty. Bishop Cheney sat alone in his study. His mind was bccupied with fearful questionings. Could it be that there was no Scriptural authority for the baptism of infants? Was it possible that the formula observed by the Church and the sprinkling of a little water on the brow of. an unconscious child regenerated the soul? No, no, this could not be. The Holy Spirit must, Himself, renew the soul. And if it was His office work alone-could He not, , .      328       Evangel Wiseman. would. He not, did He not do it, without man's aid? The infant baptism of the Bible was wholly inferential; there was no command but for believers; and where it was    X supposed infants must have been baptized, it could never X be satisfactorily proved that there were any infants there. iX If Christ had desired the baptism of infants, would He  i' not have given a command for it, and would not the Holy A Spirit have left some instance on record where. there would be no doubt? Surely, such an important matter should have : been made so definite, so positive, as to admit of no doubt. X Dr. Cheney supposed that, perhaps, in the last moments, is Miss Delia's importunity might overcome Mr. Wiseman's  X resolution, and it might perchance be decided to send for - ? him. With this view in his maind -he sat alone in his study, hour after hour, his brain teeming with strange question- ings. He must look more fully into the subject: he must satisfy his own mind as to the amount of evidence on both X sides. Not that he had the most remote idea of changing his practice. Oh, no; he had been brought up in this way,  and, in the words of a Methodist sister, "It would look  ugly to forsake it now." But, as an intellectual matter, he would master it, not to change his course at all, even though he should find the weight of evidence largely against him, but he would be satisfied.         ! The babe slept. The mother sat watching. Her soul  was pouring itself out in prayer that God would support  her and bring her through her anticipated trial. She  ! dared not, for a moment, hope for its recovery. She had yielded it up into the hands of the Lord, and to death;  and as hour after hour passed on and the little one awoke  not, she felt that already it was gone from her-only the form remained.  * Midnight came, and with it a change. I   Miss .Delia's Decision.     329 ' Miss Delia had prevailed upon Evangel to lie down for a rest while she sat watching beside the cradle. The little one opened its eyes with a stare, moaned piteously, and moving its head from side to side, appeared to be ill great pain. The mother started to her feet, and gaining the side of the couch, bent over it in mute agony. Miss Delia seized the ewer of water and the Prayer-book, both of which had been placed conveniently on the little table ill the room, and took her stand at the head of the little bed. "But, Herbert, aunt Delia I Wait until I call him, and mother, and Lilly. Wait! waitl I will go now "And Evangel rushed from the room. "Oh, he cannot object in the face of death, and even if he does, it is my duty. I feel it is-I know it is," said Miss Delia to'herself; and without a word of sanction from the parents, she opened the Prayer-book and rever- ently began to read the form for baptism. Mr. Wiseman had not been sleeping. He had spent the hour in fervent prayer, that if God could spare the child consistent with His wise and loving purposes, He would do so. He had prayed in faith and with great submission to the will of the Father, and he felt his prayer would be answered--that Vernon would be spared. In a moment he was at the open door of the chamber. The low, fervent tones of Miss Delia fell upon his ear. He understood the whole matter, and passing quickly in, proceeded to her side, just. as she had finished the prayer. He stood beside her. The book was not yet closed. The bowl of water was on the table to her left. He did not hesitate for a moment. He knew his duty and did it. "Not now, aunt Delia," he said in a tone decided, yet gentle, "Vernon must not be sprinkled, must not be."     330      Evangel Wiseman. "But, Herbert, Herbert, he is dying! Oh, I beseech you, let him not go unprepared. Let me baptize him, let i me baptize himl It can do him no harm. See, he will soon be gone " she exclaimed frantically, as the child moved restlessly in his bed.  The mother looked on this strange procedure perfectly mute; not a word escaped her lips. Lilly was speechless. X "Vernon must not be sprinkled, aunty. Living or dying this shall not be done."                A "And will you let him be lost, lost, Herbert? Think of dear little Herbert!"  "In heaven, aunty, saved by the Saviour's blood."  ki "But Vernon will die. And you promised me, Herbert,  @ that he might be baptized. I tell you he must be baptized. It is my duty, and I must do it I " said Miss Delia, wrought i almost to a frenzy by her 'continued excitement, and the dreadful thought that the child would certainly be lost if not baptized. Mr. Wiseman had looked at the child, but he could not tell whether it was dying or not. It was quiet, only when X disturbed by the earnest voice of Miss Delia, then it would I fitfully open its eyes, moan, and move its little hands. Miss Delia stood, ewer in hand and Prayer-book opened,  determined to do what she felt was her duty, not in willful ,  obstinacy, but under the weight of the dreadful conviction  that if not baptized the child must be forever damned. , Mr. Wiseman saw that he must decide the matter per-  i j emptorily. The babe must be kept quiet,- as otherwise the  most fearful consequences would ensue. So he gently  took the ewer in one hand, and laying the other on Miss Delia's arm, he firmly led her to the couch, and in a tone of kind command, bade her lie down and rest. Overcome, thwarted in her her purpose, filled with the   AMiss Delia's Decision.      331 thought of the loss of the dying child's soul, Miss Delia threw herself prostrate on the bed and burst into a flood of tears. Evangel, as one stupefied, sat down beside the little bed, her face wearing that calm, cold look, which shows that for the moment emotion is frozen in -the soul and thought dead in the mind. She was scarcely sentient. Everything was a fearful, perplexed dream. Only the piercing eye of God could read the state of her being. To man she appeared calm, resigned. Mrs. Vernon, who had been aroused by Lilly, hastily throwing on her dressing-gown and putting on her slippers, repaired to the room to see, as she supposed, the child in its death-throes. She approached the cradle. The child was still. She listened: its breathing was low and regular. Gently she febl-its face and hands, and watched it for a moment. Evangel scrutinized her movements, but spoke not. "Vernon is better, Evangel," she said in a cheerful voice. The mother started from her dream. "Better, mother, better?" and looked up confusedly, "is my darling better? Oh, can it be? Thank God, thank God!"And the tried one buried her head in her hands and wept aloud in her gratitude. "Yes, my daughter, Vernon is better. His breathing is relieved, his fever abated, and his countenance relaxed and composed. Has his medicine acted 7' "I do not know, mother. I have given it as the Doctor directed, but as I had no hope for the child's life, I have not watched for its effects. "It has soothed and quieted him at least.

All tears were dried, save Miss Delia's. The disappointment was too great for her     j strained nerves, and she could not control her weeping. %: Mr. Wiseman kindly led her from the room.  The morning came-the babe lived. Dr. Rives called    X early and pronounced it better.           -   X Miss Delia's heart rejoiced. There was yet hope for the baptism, the gown and the cap.  Let us now look at the manner, the progress, and the results of the great meeting which was being held in  Chester under the preaching of Rev. Mr. Earle. Already, as we have said, Dr. Eaton's meeting-house*  was unable to accommodate the throng that pressed to hear the, earnest preacher, and he had been compelled to remove to the large Masonic hall, near the center of the city. The whole town felt the influence of the meeting.  It had already reached every -family, and at night the   capacious hall was filled long before the hour for services. All denominations were represented in the vast assembly.  Scores laid aside their prejudices against the Baptists, and  went to the hall gladly to hear the word of God, when they Would have gone reluctantly to Dr. Eaton's meeting-house. Episcopalians were there, even those of the " high church " *I prefer the use of this most appropriate term. "Church" is too indefinite.   Mr. Earle's Meeting.       335 ' type; and while it was evident they did not regard it as their meeting, they were nevertheless much interested. Presby- terians, Old and New School, and Methodists were present in numbers, and felt at home, their ministers often praying and speaking in the meetings. Dr. Cheney had been there but once. Men, old and young, who had never found time to go and hear preaching, first through curios- ity, and then from personal interest, were listeners each night. And some who had never paused to ask the momentous question: "How shall my soul be saved?"' pondered it now, and rose to ask the prayers of God's. people that they might find the Saviour. Even the children in the streets talked of the " big meetings." The preaching was simple, yet very earnest. Each one: ill the house felt that every word was addressed to him. and every word was fitted to his condition. The services were varied. No set form of procedure, as though the Spirit of God must act and demonstrate its power according to the formula of man. Prayer, singing, confession, testifying for Jesus, filled the time before and after the sermon. There was no confusion, no undue excitement, no sham, no show. All was quiet, orderly, earnest, and yet every individual was moved and made. to- think,-most of them to act. No one could be a mere, looker-on. It was not a spectacle to behold and criticise, but a great movement in which each individual present, the oldest, the youngest, had a personal interest, a per- sonal responsibility. Seeds were sown in every heart.. Some should perish, doubtless, but others should produce ten, twenty, and a hundred-fold. The sunrise prayer-meetings were well attended; the afternoon congregations were large; at night the hall was crowded.     Evangel Wiseman. The "meeting" was the subject of remark whenever friends met, and business men talked to their customers about the "great revival."  Throughout the town of Chester it was the one subject of consideration. Thursday night came. The hall was filled at an early hour. Mr. Earle was to preach on the "Unpardonable Sin," a question that many of his hearers were personally interested in. The discourse was clear, convincing, effec- tive. The preacher showed what this fearful sin is-the rejection of the Spirit of God until He takes his everlasting flight. He then portrayed how a man might decide for himself if he were in this hopeless condition. And then he offered Jesus, the Saviour of all sinners, to all, even to. the vilest, and urged upon men, whatever might be their sins, to repent and seek forgiveness of Christ, who was able and willing to save unto the uttermost. He pleaded with all to come to Jesus, not to reject Him, but breaking down their- pposition, to seek Him then, to be reconciled to Him then; for, He was standing ready with outstretched arms to save all who were truly penitent, and to save them now. Every heart was moved, and when opportunity was given for all wishing to make known their desire to be saved, fully a hundred men and women left their seats and quietly went forward for prayer. Among the vast number was Mr. Carlton, the second time he had made any demonstration, although he had been in regular attendance on the whole series of meetings, even those held at sunrise. Annie Chiles was there too; she had learned from her own deep internal experienie what a ' change of heart" meant. She had been taught by the Spirit of God that the salvation of the soul was not in rites and ceremonies and dogmas, but in the merits of   the blood of Christ applied to that soul, by faith laying hold on him as its Saviour. She had spoken to no one about her fearful condition. She dared not. Her Episco- pal friends could give her no comfort; they would deride her fancies and lead her to fall back on her baptism and confirmation. And as Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman were watch- ing over the couch of their little Vernon, she would not intrude her anxieties upon them. The conflict had been a severe one with her, 'for previous to the arrival of Mr. Earle, she had not so much as recognized there was a Holy Spirit.  In her deep distress she had thought of going to Dr. Eaton, but then he was a stranger to her and a Baptist minister, and if counsel must be sought of any one, why should it not be her own beloved rector, Dr. Cheney. And yet whenever the thought of disclosing herself to him faintly suggested itself, she would shrink back from the step, feeling that he would not understand her-would miscon- ceive her struggles, and only leave her in deeper and darker distress. Alone she had tried to pray for herself, but she did not know how to pray, only as the Prayer-book taught, and this did not satisfy her burdened soul. She had wanted to go forward several times, but then the tempter would say to her, "How will you look? you, a member of the Episcopal Church    Will you go to be prayed for at a Baptist meeting, and that before all these people? How indelicate! What a subject of gossip you will make yourself I" And she would yield to his influ- ence and iA1nain in her seat. But her soul was weighed down beneath its strange burden. But to-night she forget all things but this one absorbing question: "How shall I be saved from my sins?"      336       Evangel Wiseman. Willie Nesbitt had found Christ, and was rejoicing in Him.  When he became convinced of his need of a Saviour, he rested not until he felt the sweet assurance of pardon.  He had gone to William Wiseman for instruction, for he a did not even theoretically understand the plan of salvation; ! and then he had soughtf an interview with Mr. Earle, who A had prayed with him and directed his mind to Christ; and led by the Holy Spirit he had been enabled to cast aside  -all things and cling to the Saviour.          g Miss Beaumont and her brother were also among those who sought Jesus on that Thursday night; and William Robinson bowed too, to ask Christ to be merciful to him, a sinner. 'His sister remained apparently unmoved; although i deeply feeling, she would not make any demonstration, for she wore around her neck all amulet to protect from evils, and uttered written prayers to the Virgin Mary and a host of saints to intercede for her. But she would not come to Jesus to intercede for herself. She had imbibed the soul-destroying doctrine that Christ can be found only through the means appointed by the Romish Church, not knowing, poor, blinded, infatuated girl, that whosoever will may, at any time or place, come unto Him and be healed. "Too much confession, too much prayer, too much demonstration, Mr. Wiseman," she said to her young friend as they returned home after the meeting. "I should g like the meeting so muc!l more if there was more form and  ceremony observed," "Indeed, it would be greatly preferable Athink, Miss Robinson, if it woere as you remark," interposed Miss Mor- daunt, as she leaned on the arm of Willie Nesbitt. - She had been-out of deference to her friend, Mrs. Falkland, with   Mr. Earle's Meeting.        337 whom  she was staying--a regular attendant upon the meetings, and, as everything was so novel and interests ing, she had enjoyed them very much. Each day Willie Nesbitt had become more and more interested in this magnificent Southern belle. Each day Miss Mordaunt had found herself more and more pleased with the frank art- lessness of her admirer. He had for the present forgotten that she was a Catholic, and she entirely lost sight of the fact that he had so recently become a Baptist. Extremes  had met. "I do not think, Miss Robinson," he replied, " that we should object to a full, free expression of our needs. I* I cannot object to the particular manner in which a meet- ing is conducted, so that we are assured the Holy Spirit is present, blessing the means that we poor feeble mortals use to convince men and women of their need of a Saviour." "Oh, but I think other things would do better, be more in accordance with our tastes. I do so much like the rites and forms of the Holy Catholic Church." 4 It is by-the foolishness of preaching that God is pleased to save them that believe, Miss Eugenia," he replied with  deep earnestness.               r "Who says so, Mr. Wiseman?" she asked, saucily. "Does the Church teach this?" "Alas, no; but the Bible does,-better authority than the Church. Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, uttered these words, and all the organizations in the world cannot ignore nor undo their power." "Well, wAl, everybody must think for himself, Mr. Wiseman. It's no use for you and me tod argue; we are the poles apart. I believe in the Holy Mother Church, and you do not. I am a believer, and you a heretic, that's 2.     338       Evangel Wiseman.              all," she said laughingly; then turned the subject of con- : versation to their departure for Kentucky the following X -week.       i                  X "I shall not return with you, Miss Eugenia.".  "And why not, sir? Didn't you set out with our party, -i and are you going to forsake us now? I think this is    cruel."                        ! "There are several reasons why I should remain. One   is the sickness of my brother's child; another, I wish to attend this meeting until it closes, and--"       i "Oh, yes, I understand, Mr. Wiseman, and another-  is-there is a young ladrthat, binds you to Chester and ! ill .not let you go. Come e, you need not deny it. We all see it too plainly," she added, as the young man  i hesitated to assent, and yet did not dare to confess. "Well, well I all right I but remember she is an Episco- E palian, and you are a Baptist, and divisions in religious matters are serious things in a family, I have often heard folks say. But then, perhaps, one of you may change but I will venture my new herbarium, it will not- beyou. We poor women have always to yield. Convinced or uncon- vinced, the ladies must go with their husbands, just as if they had no minds of their own, and no consciences either. But I bid you beware of an Episcopalian. You know they are hard to convince. But if you are not going with me, some one else is," she said, naively. "And who is this some one else, Miss Eugenia?" "Shall I tell you?"  Certainly." "Well, you must keep my secret.   It lis our new acquaintance, Mr. De Witt." And thus gaily chatting, without an expression of a spir- itual character, she walked on until, reaching the hotel, she bade him good-night.   Mr. Earle's Meeting.        339 William Wiseman, turning his steps toward his brother's house, offered up a prayer that the Holy Spirit would lead her to an appreciation of her condition and an accept- ance of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. Mr. Beaumont had accompanied Miss Chiles, Mr. Carl- ton Miss Robinson, Mr. Robinson Miss Lanier. All these came away deeply influenced by the spirit of the meeting, and the conversation df the respective couples was of it and of its power. Great was the consternation among the members of the Church, when it "Was whispered on the following day, from family to family, that Annie Chiles was going to be a Bap- tist. Lilly Vernon was startled by the intelligence, Miss Delia exasperated, Dr. Cheney aroused and alarmed. But Annie had not become a Baptist; this was not the point she had  under consideration. It was her soul's salvation, not her church membership. "The entrance of thy word giveth light." We   shall see how  this was verified in the case of several of our young friends. ,                         v     340       Evangel Wiseman. CHAPTER XXi.  THE BAPTISM. T(HEERE are stops in life: times when we must needs sit calmly down and take a retrospect. And as the past comes in clear review before us, crowded as it has been all along the way, with varied incidents,-some so pleasing, some so trying,--here a Mizpeh where sore judgment comes, and there an Ebenezer where we make  a record of the glorious truth, "Hitherto has the Lord  helped us,"-here a Baca, where, 'mid tears and toils, like the old patriarch in Canaan, we exclaim, "All these things are against me," and there a Bethel, and a Miahanaim, and a Peniel, where our very name was changed, because we had power with God and prevailed. All along we find "Harans" and the "Ford Jabbok,"and " the way to Ephrath." But thanks to Him  who giveth us the Victory, we are enabled to avouch in the presence of the universe, as did Jacob when he came to the journey's end, that the Angel-Jehovah has redeemed us from all evil. Evil has been our attendant, but we have been delivered therefrom and made victors, glorious conquerors, over it all. We are so prone to forget the good, and dwell only on the "evil." Why is this, but that the Spirit of God does not dwell "richly" in, our hearts? We will not learn of Christ, but take lessons in every other school-in the school of doubt, of fear, of human reason, of man's inven-- tions, of misguided hope,-learn from all else but from the Meek and Lowly One, who alone can give wisdom, peace and joy.   Th/e Baptism.         341 AMen will have their hobbies. It is so much more grati- fying to our self-love to say, "I think so," and "I believe this," than to learn and to do what Christ has bidden. But let us remember we are his friends only when we " do whatsoever He has commanded." May the Holy Spirit enable every reader of this story to attend to these words of Jesus: "Ye are my friends   if ye do whatsoever I command you." John 15: 14. With Evangel Wiseman the crisis had come. She was now in the furnace, heated " seven times." Will not one "like unto the Son of God" walk with her there, that she be not consumed? Her struggle had been long and painful. The contest between Faith and Form had been sharp and close-set, and oftentimes the victory was doubtful. But at each onslaught of Form, Faith aroused and girded on the armor of the gospel, and fought valiantly for the right; but the allies of Form,--Fear and Early Teaching, would rush to her aid, and Faith would have for a time to yield. The babe continued to improve as Dr. Rives had pre- dicted. Evangel received him as from the dead. Oh! how grateful was her mother's heart, as, in the soft evening hour, she could place him in his little carriage, and with Bridget Mahoney to draw it, pass up and down the pave- ment beneath the cool of the grand old trees  A week has gone. Vernon is well. A little paleness lingers still, but ,it is passing away before the touch of the pure life-current, which leaves as it passes the rose-tint in the soft baby cheek.  It is the evening hour. The babe is lying qn Miss Delia's lap on the front porch, breathing in the sweet fresh air that comes from the woodlands and meadows, and steals through the roses and honeysuckles, kissing     342       Evangel Wiseman.             l away their sweetness, to bear it broadcast to all. Mr. and Mrs. Vernon had just bidden farewell. Lilly is gath-  ering flowers for a bouquet for "somebody" whom she expects after tea. Evangel is engaged with her household X -pleasures, for it is a joy to her to make her home happy for her husband, whom she is every moment expecting.  -i So she looks after the dining-room to see that it is in f proper order, and does not leave it to Bridget, who, though faithful, will, like other servants, prove forgetful of a knife,  or a spoon, or the napkins. . - "Ah! Lilly, I understand, do I not?' Mr. Wiseman said to his sister, playfully, as she emerged from behind a large frame overgrown with woodbine, bearing in her hand the flowers she had gathered " for somebody that's  ! coming." "Well, that's right. But what will aunty do?"  he added, as he took a seat beside Miss Delia to play with l Vernon.  "Come, aunty, won't you veto this whole    t affair?" ' What affair, Herbert?" "Aunty understands well enough, Sis," he said to Lilly, who was passing into the hall as quickly as possible, for she was not at all disposed to hear "aunty's opinion" on the subject mentioned. "Well, since aunt Delia is ignorant we shall let her remain so, shan't we, Lilly?" And he caught her hand to detain her a moment. "Oh, yes, yes, aunty has no time for such trivialities, brother. She is wholly engaged with the baby. Do you know she never allows any of us to nurse it at all-only lets us wait on her and look on?" Mr. Wiseman took the babe gently from Miss Vernon's arms, and walking up and down the porch with it, was as happy as a father could be, to behold its improved appearance.    The Baptism.         343 "Well, aunty is a first-rate nurse. Vernon grows better every hour. He looks quite well again." And he tossed the little fellow up and down vigorously. "You'll shake the child to pieces, Herbert I " exclaimed aunt Delia, as she sprang from her low chair and rushed to its rescue. "Come  come! give me that boy this moment. You may plead law very well, and be good I  in an argument, but I tell you, you can't nurse a baby. Hand him to me this minute, I tell you I "  And she forced the child away, saying, half in laugh, half in earnest, "Papa will kill you, little one. He is determined you shall die without baptism." 'And you are equally determined, I believe, aunty, that he shall not die without baptism," he responded pleasantly, as he paused in front of her and looked kindly into her face. "Had I been a moment later that night, you would have had him sprinkled." "Yes, that I would. And I tell you, Herbert, it ought to have been done. Just suppose he had died without it, wouldn't it have been dreadful? Oh, I can't think of it. I am so thankful he was spared. Just suppose he had died, where would he have been now?" asked Miss Delia, with all the earnestness of her soul. "In heaven, aunty." Miss Delia shook her head doubtfully; she scarcely dared to contradict Mr. Wiseman, nor did she feel disposed to enter into an argument with,him. "It's not too late, Herbert, for you to do your-duty," Miss Vernon said, looking him full in the face. "I do- not wish now to discuss this subject, but the day will come when you will see it in its true light, and then you will do what's right., Otherwise-but I'll not say now." "That I will, aunty; whenever I can see it to be dutvy, I'll have it done."     344      Evangel Wiseman. "That is all I ask, Herbert. I know you can be con- vinced, and I think you will have an opportunity very soon." "What do you mean, aunt Delia?" asked Mr. Wiseman,  suddenly pausing in his walk to and fro across the porch, while his face became intensely earnest and interested in its expression. He felt Miss Delia's words had a hidden meaning.  "Wait and see!" was the laconic reply. Just then Evangel came out to bid her husband good- evening, and invite them in to tea. The conversation rn triflingly on during the tea-hour, various topics being touched, one of which brought the deepened color to Lilly's fair cheek, and excited a most eager curiosity in the mind of aunt Delia, who now began for the first time to realize the drift of matters. Vernon's baptism, of course, did not pass unargued. But you will promise me, aunty," Mr. Wiseman said, after expressing his views, which were fully concurred in by his wife, "that under no circumstances will you have Vernon baptized without our knowledge." Miss Delia hesitated to reply. She looked at the babe, as he lay on the large sofa,-remembered what her church thought of the dreadful fate of her precious Herbert, then of all her hopes and fears, not forgetting the handsome robe and the new cap,-and, then replied with marked emphasis: "I can never, never, NEVER, make such a promise." And she arose quickly, and taking the babe in her arms, passed from the room.                   .   The Baptism.         345 Two. weeks have gone. The meeting of Mr. Earle has closed. Many have professed to have found Jesus, "the Son of God, who taketh away the sin of the world," and are rejoicing in the hope of eternal life through Him; many more have been awakened to some degree of realization of their condition as lost without an interest through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Some will persevere until they shall emerge from the night of sin into the glorious light of the truth as it is in Jesus. Others will turn back; their hearts swept and garnished shall become the abode of seven spirits more wicked than those driven out, and their last state shall be worse than the first. Thus it is ever, under the preaching of the Gospel. It is a "savor of life unto life" to some, "a savor of death unto death" to others. Faithfully, earnestly, clearly, and with all simplicity, and with a sublime faith in its truth and power, has this obedi- ent and trusting man of God presented the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to all, and urged upon them to accept it, and be reconciled to Him who alone can take away their sins.  Many have sought and found Jesus. 'None in the com- nmnity that have not been reached directly or indirectly by the influences of the wonderful meeting." A week has passed since his last sermon. During that time services have been held in some of the churches, and many have united with the various congregations. Never before in its annals, has Chester known such a time. It is Sunday night. A large concourse of people have assembled in the Baptist Church. The hour for preaching has come. Every seat is occupied; chairs have been brought in until the aisles and the space around the pulpit are filled with those who have been led thither by the occa- sion. Many are present who have never before been in the     346       Evangel Wiseman.  walls of the building. The pool is open. Twenty per- sons who have found Jesus, are to put Him on publicly in baptism. Twenty-five made like profession the Sunday X night previous.  Among the number to be immersed    s to-night, are several of the Drominent citizens of Chester.  Mr. Everett, the lawyer, who for years has been a Presby- terian, and whose influence is as great as that of any other man in Chester, is one of the candidates. It is a sore trial to his pastor, Dr. Peterson, and to all of the congregation where he has so long worshiped, and by whom he is so much beloved. It is a trial to him also, to part with those dear friends, with whom he has walked for years; but his mind is convinced that he has not been baptized, though sprinkled in ipfancy, and he hears the command of Jesus and must obey. It has been a severe struggle with Mr. Everett, against all considerations that his past relation with the Presbyterian Church could urge; but, clear in judgment, decided in purpose, and seeking with honest heart to do the will of the Master, he to-night stands up to- acknowledge Him before men, in the ordinance of Christ's own appointment. Annie Chiles is also one of the number. Through much tribulation she has come, and-after a great conflict with doubts and fears as to her acceptance with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and entreaties and warnings from those she loves, toremain in the Episcopal'Church-she has felt her duty to be baptized. So she has taken up the Cross, and oh, how heavy it is! and listening to the voice of Jesus, she is about to follow Him into the emblematic grave.  ' Through floods and flames, if Jesus leads, I must follow where He goes-)-  she said over and over to herself, as she saw before 'her those- she had known from her infancy, those who- were   The Baptism.         347 dear to her, whom she loved with the strongest love, and whom she would not offend for her life in any matter where conscience was not involved. Those who have passed through the " deep waters " of such an occasion know what it is. And did not the voice of Jesus say, "Leave all and follow me," and "Lo, I am with you always, even until the end of the world," not. even the bravest heart could stand the ordeal. "A new heart," she heard William Wiseman say one day at his brother's. A new heart," she had said over and over to herself, until she realized that there was something more required to be a Christian, than forms and ordinances. She had been led to read the Bible; had laid aside the Prayer-book for the word of God; and instructed from the pulpit, and guided arid enlightened by the Holy Spirit, she had at last come to understand her whole duty, and she dared not shrink from the performance of it. Mr. Carlton was also to be baptized.  Willie Nesbitt had been one of the number that Dr. Eaton had immersed the previous Sunday night, and his face, so radiant with the light that comes down from   above, was testimony ,strong and convincing for the truth of the Gospel. It was a solemn occasion, - one that interested and impressed all present. Dr. Eaton's discourse bore upon the rite to be administered. He gave the views that Bap- tists hold, and their scriptural authority for their belief and practice. Not one quotation outside the lids of the Bible.  That he made  himself understood and felt, the sequences will prove. Miss Mordaunt listened with undivided attention. She had grown intensely interested in the Baptists of Chester. "Obedience is better than sacrifice." Would that all who profess to love Jesus would learn of Him, and follow Him in all the appointments of His honor.     '348      Evangel Wiseman.  One after another of the twenty candidates were led  i down into the liquid grave. Old and young of both sexes were there, following in the footsteps of Him who died,  was buried, and rose again, that they might have eternal l life. And think you not that angels, God's messengers,  though all unseen, hover over such occasions and rejoice to see men and women, created in the image of God, sub- mitting with firm faith and joyful hearts to those institu- tions which His Son, in His wisdom and love, saw fit to leave for us who profess His name? Whatever may be said by those of different opinions from Baptists, one thing is true,--that is, if immersion is valid baptism, which they all admit, neither sprinkling nor pouring is. Immersion is plainly significant of the burial and resurrection of Christ. Baptism is tp testify' of this burial and resurrec- tion. Sprinkling is to testify of the Holy Spirit, so its advocates maintain. But the office of the Holy Spirit is to testfy of Christ, not of Himself. And nowhere inl the lids of the Bible are we taught that there is any church ordinance to testify of the Holy Spirit. There is no such doctrine in the Bible, however much it may be found else- where. The two ordinances, Baptism and the Lord's Supper, testify of Jesus. And if sprinkling is to testify of the Holy Spirit, then it is of human invention, for there is m no such record in the New Testament. A deep stillness pervaded the large assembly, as the  a minister of the ordinance of Christ's Church, with uplifted hands, pronounced the solemn benediction. Never before in Chester had so many persons witnessed a baptismal scene. That night, seeds were sown which ere long shall spring up to the honor and glory of God. But there must come the storm first.   A -New Phase.         349 CHAPTER XXII A NEW PHASE. IT was Monday afternoon, the day following the baptism in Dr. Eaton's church. There was an earnest meeting of ministers in progress in the study of Rev. Mr. Ken- nelly, one of the Methodist ministers of the city. -Several leading Pedo-Baptists were present in council, among them, Mr. Peterson, the Presbyterian. The next morning, the Sentinel, the daily sheet of Ches- ter, announced that "Rev. Mr. Nailom would deliver a, series of lectures on 'the Church' and ' Baptism' in the Presbyterian church, beginning the next Wednesday night. All invited to attend. Seats free." "Who is this Rev. Mr. Nailom, Mr. Everett?" asked Mr. Wiseman of his fiiend, as they met after breakfast in the court-room. "He is a minister of the Presbyterian church,"- answered Mr. Everett; "one who has in the last year gone from town  to town, delivering lectures on the subjects announced in. this morning's paper." "Do you know anything of the man? Is he indorsed by his denomination?" "I think he is. I know nothing of him personally, but  have several times heard his name mentioned." "And is he a good lecturer?" "He is regarded so. I know some who have heard him; they say he presents his views forcibly and clearly, and also very convincingly."     350       Evangel Wiseman.  "  Well, I suppose we shall have to hear him. But how  does it chance that he should come to Chester just at this  time?-a man who was never here before-and come, too, for such a purpose? It appears to me the result of design." "I cannot tell how it has been brought about. You are aware I am not acquainted with the movements of our Pedo-baptist friends now," replied Mr. Everett.  "We must hear him, I suppose. It is presumable he will give the Presbyterian view of the church and of baptism. You know that it differs somewhat from the Episcopal, inasmuch as their basis is the 'covenant' and not 'baptis- mal regeneration.' The arguments of the latter I sifted thoroughly, and find them without Scriptural foundation. I do not know the line of reasoning urged by Presbyterians quite so well, but am aware they build on the Abrahamic covenant, contending that the Church has ever been the same in all ages, and that under the Gospel dispensation, baptism takes the place of circumcision under the old. Isn't this their view?"  "Yeg, yes, you have it, Mr. Wiseman; and they make a pretty strong argument, too, I assure you; one that con- vinced me of the validity of infant sprinkling for a long time. I hope you will hear Mr. Nailom. It is always well to know both sides of the question." "You Baptists are going to get used up now, Herbert," said Miss Delia to Mr. Wiseman, with an air of pleased triumph, as the latter sat beside her in the hall, awaiting his dinner. "Why, what do you mean, aunty?" he replied, taking upon himself an air of great surprise. "What's the mat- ter now?"    A New Phase.         351 Why, didn't you see the announcement in this morn- ing's paper, of Mr. Nailom, who is going to begin a series of lectures to-morrow night in. Mr. Peterson's church? They do say he uproots the Baptists in toto, and proves infant baptism so clearly, and that, too, from the Scrip- tures, that no one can say a word against it. And now, Herbert, I want you to promise that you will go to hear him and take Evangel with you, so that you may both be thoroughly convinced, and this precious little one,"- and she held Vernon up before the father-" may be made a child of God, through the rite which He Himself has instituted." "But, aunty, Mr. Nailom doesn't himself believe that infants are made children of God in baptism. "Oh, you are mistaken, Herbert. I know he does." "Who told you, aunty?" "Why, Mrs. Peterson herself. I called at Dr. Cheney's this morning as I came over here, and he told me all about Mr. Nailom's coming, and what a wonderful man he is, and how he can prove infant baptism from the Bible, and how he makes it so clear that all the Baptists even have to acknowledge it. And I became so interested about the matter, that I ran over to Mrs. Peterson's. Mr. Nailom is a member of the Presbyterian church, and Mrs. Peterson told me all about him."  "And what did she tell you, aunty?" "Why, that he is the greatest reasoner on this subject in all this country, and can prove infant baptism so clearly, and that from the Bible-mark that, from the Bible; no fathers nor church history, but from the Bible itself-that no one, not even the Baptists, can gainsay his evidence." Miss Delia spoke at the top of her voice. Evangel, hear- ing her excited tone, came in to see what was the cause of     352       Evangel Wiseman.             her ardor. She had not looked for her husband so soon;  was surprised to see him. "Anything wrong?" she asked, as she bent her eyes on her babe. "Wrong,! no, indeed," answered Miss Delia quickly; "far from it; everything is as it should be." "What is the interesting topic that calls forth your enthusiasm, aunty?" "I have just been telling Herbert that Mr. Nailom, a Presbyterian preacher, is coming to town, will be here to-morrow morning, and, to-morrow evening will begin a series of lectures on the Church and Baptism; and Dr. Cheney and Mrs. Peterson both told me, as I was coming here, that he proves infant baptism as clear as noon-day from the Bible; and I want you and Herbert to go 'and hear him, and I want you to promise that if you are convinced, you will have Vernon baptized' right away. Thenll lie will be safe and my mind at ease. Say, won't you promise me this?" The wife looked at her husband and smiled.  / "Yes, aunt Delia, we promise-you that if your friend shall prove conclusively from the Bible that infants ought to be baptized, we shall have it done." "Oh, Herbert, I am so glad! Then the matter of this little darling's salvation will be forever settled." And she bent over the babe and imprinted a fervent kiss on its soft, white cheek. "But, aunty, the Presbyterians do not believe and preach baptismal regeneration. They advocate infant sprinkling, but not for the salvation of the child's soul."  "Well, I would like to know what it is for, thfen, if it  isn't going to save the child? You are mistaken, Herbert. They believe as we do on this point."    A New Phase.         353 "Well, well, aunty, it doesn't matter as to the object, I suppose. If he shall prove from the Bible that babies should be sprinkled, then Vernon must be sprinkled, let the object for which it is done'be what it may." Wednesday evening came. The Presbyterian church- bell rang out at an early hour its call to the people to come up to the house of worship. The expectations of the citizens were highly aroused, for all the opponents of the Baptists had taken great care to let every one know how very famous Mr. Nailom was, in his peculiar sphere of proving all Pedoism right and all Baptist principles and practices wrong. The hour for the lecture came. The house was pretty , well filled. All denominations were represented. Episco- palians were out in full force. The defection, of one so prominent as Annie Chiles had aroused the whole body. In one corner near the pulpit sat Dr. Eaton. It was evident he had come prepared to take notes. Both Methodist ministers were present. The countenances of all expressed intense excitement. The lecturer arose and prayed. Of his personnel we shall not now speak. After lengthy preliminary remarks, in which he set forth the general object of his visit, the subject of his prepared lectures, and what he desig'ned to accomplish, he proceeded to state that his theme to-night would be the ' Church," and he would show conclusively that children are included in the Church under the new dispensation, as they were under the old, and per necessitate entitled to all its privileges, baptism, etc., etc. After having stated the points which he should establish beyond controversy during  his series, he stepped aside from the subject matter of his first lecture, viz: ," That the infants of believing parents, or of a believing parent, are 23     354       Evangel Wiseman.  Scriptural subjects of Christian baptism," to give a short history of the Baptists, which he very politely and kindly styled the A-B-ab Church, remarking that it had sprung i into existence at a very late date in the Christian era, and in its bigotry and narrow-mindedness, excluded from its fellowship those who could trace back through all genera- tions to the covenant made with Abraham. It was evident  from the Rev. Mr. Nailom's manner and method, that he was determined to strike the Baptist nail fully on the head, and drive it clean 6ut of the sight of the people. He went at his business in a real "s pull off your coat, and roll up your sleeves " fashion. His animadversions were strikingly unique, well calcu- lated to attract and fix attention, if not to please and edify. Every one listened with undivided interest. "And now, my friends, in the outset let me ask who or what characters,- according to the law of Christ, are to receive Christian baptism. I shall hereafter talk to you of the mode of baptism. I wish to-night to bring before you the proper subjects. I suppose all present admit that under the gospel dispensation, no one -should be a member of Christfs Church unless he has been baptized. However pious a man may be, however circumspect this conduct, however clear his evidences that he is a child of God, he has no right to church-membership until he has submitted to this initiatory rite of the Church. "Now, I suppose all preaent admit this proposition; and this being granted, the great and important inquiry is,-now I wish all to mark what I am going to say, for I desire to make all present understand each separate proposition as I proceed,-the question that presents itself is--Vho, or what characters are, according to the law Nof  God, to enjoy membership in His Church? Now I wish   A New Phase.         355 you all to understand fully the proposition." And Mr. Nailom repeated it with great emphasis. "The answer to this question will necessarily determine to whom baptism is to be administered. For it is self- evident, that if an individual has a light to be in the church, he has a right to enter by the door into the church. Andd this door being baptism, he has a right to be baptized. "Now, I wish you all to note what I am about to say, for it is important in deciding our question. Where shall we look for the law of membership in the Church of Christ? I answer, When the Church was first properly organized. And when was this? Not in the days of the Apostles, not in the time of David, but in the days and in the family of Abraham. It was organized when God entered into a covenant with the father of the faithful, to be a God to him and to his seed." This proposition Mr. Nailom repeated with great earn- estness. And he left the impression on the minds of his hearers, that as Abraham passed through Canaan, the promise was given, which was afterward again and again renewed, until it was sealed by circumcision. But in what respect Abraham's family was a church, and not Noah's and Adam's, the speaker did not tell. He re-asserted that the covenant with Abraham was a covenant of blessings to him and his seed forever; and turning to the various portions of Genesis where it is mentioned, he showed how- firlv God had established it with the Father of the Faithful. He did not show what this covenant was-that it was a gift of land, which land should be a  possession forever and ever-but left all to believe that it was a spiritual blessing, entirely. "This covenant, my   friends, after being repeated time     356      -Evangel Wiseman. and again to Abraham, was ratified by circumcision. Of this ratification I shall speak again." He then read in Samuel and in Chronicles, to verify that it was an everlast- ing covenant. "I wish you to note that it was an ever- lasting covenant ordered in all things and sure. And not l what does David say? Hear his words I Are they not conclusive proof? Oh, ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye children of Jacob His chosen, He is the Lord our God. His judgments are in all the earth. He hath remembered His covenant forever, the word that He commanded to a thousand generations. Which covenant He made with Abraham,-, and His oath unto Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlast- ing covenant.' "Now, we see, my friends, this covenant is an 'ever- lasting covenant for a thousand generations.' Now. we all know that a thousand generations have not passed since David wrote these words; and therefore, this covenant is lasting still, with all its blessings, all its privileges. And you all see that this everlasting covenant exists now, just as sure and well-ordered as when it was made to Abraham, and repeated by God through David to Abraham's seed. Now, I say this covenant was sealed by circumcision to Abraham's family, whose children were in it, and that these children were circumcised, and consequently were just as much partakers of the covenant as Abraham himself. Here then we find the establishment of the Church. We see children introduced into hl- Church, for Isaac and Ishmael were the clAi dren of Abraham. That which made Abra- ham a member of the Church, made Isaac and Ishmael members also. Now, this covenant, which has been reiter- ated by God to the seed of Abraham, which included all his seed, and which has never been annulled, embraced   A New Phase.         357 children. So we see, my friends, who have a right to the privileges of this covenant, children as well as parents. God Himself placed them in the Church, and if there, they must come in through the door, which door we have shown is baptism. Children have ,a right to baptism. None can deny this. They were made members of the Church by God in the covenant. When, where, let me ask, has this covenant been set aside? When have chil- dren been taken out of this covenant? No living man can show where. And if not, all must admit that they are still in it, for it is for a thousand generations." And thus Mr. Nailom continued to impress this point until the close of his address. The effect was electrical. How could his arguments be set aside? "Very strong," said Mr. Wiseman, in reply to his wife's interrogation, as they walked home. a' I must look into this 'covenant' matter. -I have never heard it presented so before." "It is almost conclusive to my mind," answered Evan. gel. "But I perhaps did not fully understand him. We shall have to go to-morrow night, as he will elaborate this point." "Ah, ha, what did I tell you!" said Miss Delia the next morning, as she came rushing into the room at quite an early hour, having been compelled to go to old Mrs. Oliver's the night before, to sit up with her daughter, ... who was quite sick. , What did I tell you! I knew that infant baptism was in tie Bibe, and  somebody would sooner or later show it."  "Not so fast, aunty.  There are two sides to all ques- tions. I have not looked  at this covenant matter as I should;-it is the Presbyterian view: your Episcopal belief is regeneration--but I shall do so soon."     Lights and Shadows Interlaced.     359 CHAPTER XXIII. "GHTS AND SHADOWS INTERLACED. IT had been proposed, in honor of the party from Ken- tucky, that an excursion and sail on "The Lake," should be had before-they left Chester. Mr. Wiseman had suggested it to the young gentlemen of his Bible-class, as a very pleasant method of passing a day sociably, and adding to the enjoyment of the visitor and their agree- able remembrances of the city. Thursday was selected. Arrangements were fully con- summated. It had been decided to make the trip in bug- gies, rather, than by the cars, although the railroad run within a few hundred yards of the spot. But then the country road was so fine, the scenery so beautiful, and the season so delightful, that the young gentlemen unhesita- tingly decided in favor of the drive; to which prefer- ence the ladies readily assented, for all females arm fond of the beauties of the country in spring time. Willie Nesbitt eagerly sought and secured the company of Miss Mordaunt; sMr.. De Witt, of Eugenia Robinson; Mr. Carlton, of Annie Chiles. Mr. Wiseman selected Lilly Vernon. Mr. Burleson, who had sufficiently recov- ere fropmhis attack of illness to be one of the party, chose Miss Lanier. Mr-itslelJb nephew of Mr. Everett, Mr. Wiseman's business partner, had fiaekAsperately in love with Miss Beaumont, and vowed the day would not be worth a farthing to him, unless this young lady should place herself under his special protection. William Rob- inson escorted Fannie Cheney, and Mr. Beaumont Fannie Eaton.       360       Evangel Wiseman. Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman, with Miss Delia, who would not permit Vernon to be taken unless she could accom- pany him to see that he received due meed of care, and Bridget Mahoney to do the. nursing, took a hack. 'Mr. and Mrs. Falkland, Mr. and Mrs. Everett, drove out in the former's rockaway; while Tonie Teet, Mr. Everett's man of all work, was installed chief superintendent of the wagon of edibles,--a most important position, Tonie  felt, and one he endeavored to fill with all the faithful- ness of a well-trained English servant. Tonie was an old bachelor, shriveled and dried-up in appearance, but Tonie had a big heart, although, as he often told his con- fidential friend, Mrs. Flannery the cook, "it had 'once been broke clean in two." Tonie had served in an aris- tocratic family, it- the land of his birth, where Jane Pressley had aloo served. And Tonie being young and ardent, with no one in the world to lavish his wealth of emotion upon, had fallen desperately in love with the meek and quiet Jane, and she had loved Tonie desper- ately in return. So the wedding day was fixed, and the master's family were preparing for a great supper for the happy pair, when the village curate should pro- 'nounce the bans. But alas for poor Tonie's hopes,- the very day- before the wedding one, Jane sickened, and in two short weeks died. Then Tone's heart " broke into two pieces," for he had truly loved Jane, and the world was all blackness to him since the light of his eyes lay sleeping in the.-p  e churchyard.  Tonlie.. pined and .pined---until he was only the shadow of his former jocund self, and having no friends to. bind him to the old country, he set sail for "Amerikay." He had lived in the family of Mrs. Everett's father, Mr. Sar- tain, until the old gentleman's death; after which he took   Lights and Shadows Interlaced.    361 up his abode with Miss Elizabeth, as he had always called Mrs. Everett from her childhood. Faithful and tender as a woman, he was indispensable to the comfort and happi- ness of every member of the household. The children loved Tonie dearly, and would sit with him in his quiet room, winter evenings, for hours, hearing him tell how things were in the old country, " when he was a boy," a theme of which he never wearied. He seemed to feel that all after-life was not worthy to be mentioned. A courier had been dispatched, the day before, to tell Mr. Evantine, who kept the "Lake House," to have all his sail boats in good order, which message the hypertro- phied old geltleman, with much puffing and brow-wiping had seen fully attended to. He knew it would be a grand day for him; that the old bag laid by in the walnut desk in the corner, " for a rainy day," would be considerably more puffy at night than usual. The swing in the yard was greased in the hinges, and washed off on the seats and uprights; the best room dusted and put in prime order, and every one of the four little female Evantines made to comb their red hair, (Mrs. Evantine had red hair, and the children had decided to have red hair too), - plat it a la pig tail down the back, and tie the end with - a big bow of purple and white striped ribbon, a bolt of which was kept in the house to fit out the juveniles on "extra days." KEverything was "immensely propitious," to use the original expression "koti-ebitt, who usually said what he pleased, but in a manner perfectly ig-od natured and sponta sua that always seemed well-timed and placed. The sun shone gloriously--the birds sang joyously-   - the air was full of sweet breathings--the old fruit trees along the roadside bowed in friendly recognition  all     362   .    Evangel Wiseman. nature seemed to be keeping grand jubilante in sweet symphony with the tuneful heavens. It was eight miles to the Lake, but 'ito many of the glad party it had appeared but a " span."' To no one had the merry hour passed more blithely sweet than to our friend Mr. Nesbitt, as he sat beside- her-  ' Who was to him so fair-- so dear and fair, Maidenly beautiful from head to feet, With pensive profile, delicate and sweet, And Titian's color on her sunny hair." There were many wild pulses leaping that day, for Love was busy with many hearts. And- throbbing silences more eloquent than pleading words, and looks filled with rapturous light and meaning, told the o'er true tale to throbbing hearts responsive. The spot that nature had selected to drop down the little lake in was unequivocally beautiful-fit haunt for graceful naiad and winsome dryad, sheltered in the bosom of gently sloping hills, wooded to the top and covered with grass; flecked everywhere with beautiful sunlight, with various wild flowers blooming in - sunny spots like mosaic work. On the brow of a truncated cone, lying to the north, was a miniature table land, well shaded with oak and maple, and fitted up with rustic seats, for the increased convenience of those parties which, in the spring and fall seasons, repaired to this little Eden to pass a day amid the charms of lavish Daa  atuire. The lake contained fish, and a portion of the time was always spent in endeavoring to capture " these denizens of the clear blue deep." Mr. Evantine was no IEaac Walton himself, but ,he was sharp enough to know that it was an investment that "paid." "A liberal policy is   Lights and Shadows Interlaced.     363 always the best in the end," he would say to himself, when- ever it came to his mind to make attractive additions to the Lake Grounds. But where he was not catering to the public taste for the purpose of securing the public's money, he was a "little near"; at least this was the testimony borne by his Dorothy and the four feminine representatives of the parent stock. On the i"Pic Nic Dinner Table," of which we have spoken, nature had arranged several petits bowers, which the hand of care had made quite attractive, training the vines gracefully from branch to branch of the interlacing trees, and winding them around the underbrush that served for sides and back. In each of these a seat to accommo- date two, and where large enough, two seats, had been placed. A spring of clear cool water gushed from the side next the- lake, and went quietly and steadily downward until it emptied itself into the placid waters. It had been proposed and agreed that there should be no dancing. Each one who could had taken some instru- ment of music, and after the dinner was eaten, which was served by the older ladies to the satisfaction of all, and the unmistakable delight of Tonie Teet, the various musical performers gave what they denominated an Orphean concert, and which Mr. Nesbitt declared would entice the nymphs of the woods from their hiding places, ..lv ythev dared not show themselves, for fear of the comparison with the-b-eatfi lfladies. A half-practiced eye would haveS'very. soon discovered Mr. De Witt's sincere admiration of Miss Eugenia Rob- inson. -Her vivacious conversation, her full, deep look of childlike innocence and inquiry, her seeming forgetd fulness of self, blended with her full, rounded form     364       Evangel Wiseman.  and ringing laugh, made her a paragon of enchantment in his eyes. He was sedate, inclined to reticence, a close student, a good thinker, and a man of fine literary attainments; above all truly pious. Eugenia Robinson was his contrast. How often we see such extremes in the matches men make! Is it wise or unwise thus to unite, in indissoluble ties, antipodes? Scientists of the biological school must decide. Mr. Carlton, who among all the gentlemen was the cynosure of every eye, was too exquisitely polite to show decided preference for any one of the young ladies. He had his choice, but this was known only to himself. Even the vigilant eye of Mrs. Falkland, who declared she could read lovers' secrets more readily than any fortune- telling Bohemian, failed utterly to discover his bias. There were two hearts filled with love for him-one deep, pure, and as holy as that of the angels; the other strong, passionate, and largely mixed with fancy and calculations of a worldly character. Oh, the conflict that was even now going on in the deep recesses of the true woman-heart of the one, and the happy imaginings that flitted through the excited brain of the other  Mr. Carlton felt a presage of coming trouble. He knew not why. It was indefinable, intangible, and yet real. He realized that the inevitable held him in its grasp, and that though versed in the ways of life, he dared not assume to be the arbiter of his own destiny.  - X There was one pair of evyesscifutinizing him minutely. Every word and every motion was observed and weighed. He had learned enough to know "why."  This unre- mitting surveillance of Miss Delia added to his embarrass- ment. Unlike Willie Nesbitt, he did not, could not, assume the defiant. Therefore he was driven to watch   Lights and Shadows Interlaced.     365 himself closely, so that no occasion for unjust remark might occur. It was a disagreeable ordeal, but he must go through it unflinchingly. After dinner and the concert, in which all took part either as performers or vocalists, Tonie Teet brought down the fishing-tackle, and most of the party, some in the little boats, some on the shore engaged in fishing; which proved, as such fishing usually does, more pleasur- able than profitable. Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Beaumont each caught a large fish, which was considered ominous of decided future prosperity, and many were the congratulatory wishes heaped upon these two successful piscatorial heroes. Mr. Carlton 'was sitting beside Miss Lanier, earnestly engaged in conversation. His manner was expressive of the deepest interest, while the animated look of her face bespoke her pleasure in what he was saying. Miss Delia, Fannie Eaton, Annie Chiles, Lilly Vernon and Mrs. Everett formed a group on the grass, near where Bridget was holding the baby. Pointing to Miss Lanier and Mr. Carlton, "See girls," said Miss Delia "that is just as it should be. I came out here to day, Mrs. Everett, to keep a strict watch over my girls here, Fannie Cheney and Lilly Vernon, for I tell you I am not going to have any more of our Episcopalians marrying Baptist husbands. Am I not right, Mrs. Everett?" '7" ,1 TinkJ not, Miss Vernon, especially where it results as well as Mrs. Wiseriai's case has done." Miss Delia sprung to her feet as if bitteir by-a tarantula or an Egyptian asp, and looked with horrified gaze on Mrs. Everett. "Why madame, this is just what I mean; I shall not let any more of my girls marry Baptists, just because they     366       Evangel Wiseman. are sure to forsake their church, and prove willful about having their babies baptized." Mrs. Everett laughed and seemed desiring to say some- thing, and yet almost afraid to do so. But at length she ventured to remark: "But you can baptize them, Miss Vernon; I heard you ibaptized this little one here." "No, I didn't baptize him, but should like to have done it. Wish now I had.  But I am determined it shall be ,done yet. I give you my word for it." Just at this moment a shriek was heard. All eyes were turned towards the spot whence it proceeded. The gen- tlemen who were on the shore had all rushed to the same point. Miss Eugenia Robinson had, with her merriment ,and despite Mr. De Witt's entreaties, ventured out on a log -that stretched out into the stream to " catch a big fish," as she said "they always kept close to logs in Kentucky and she supposed they did the same thing here," and in en- deavoring to steady herself, had lost her footing and fallen -into the lake. It was not very deep at this point, but as ,she had not been able to maintain an erect posture, she 1had gone under and got ".sousing wet." She was rescued without great difficulty, but not without ,detriment to several of the gentlemen's spring trousers and polished boots. Tonie, always ready, soon brought the boat, and the young lady, dripping with her unexpected "douche," yet laughing as merrily as if enrgged in the ... most humorous conversati'on, was placed in it and borne to the Lak Iiouse. Mr. De Witt thought her far more lovely and interesting than ever before. His heart was completely won. Mr. Carlton observed his movements mentally. It re- quired no cabalistic knowledge for him to cast De Witt's    Lights and Shadows Interlaced.    367 horoscope. So he quietly "booked" him for the fall excursion to Mariposa and the Great Yosemite. As Miss Mordaunt and Mr. Nesbitt sat in their little boat, on the sleeping bosom of the clear lake, and ex- changed vows of love, wholly oblivious of those around them, yet insensibly drinking in inspiration from the beauty of the scene it was to his ardent soul as if Heaven with all its glories and beatitudes had come down to earth. The songs of the celestial harps could not have been more ravishing to his ear, than were her low, subdued tones as she unreservedly and faithfully promised to be his wife. To the eye of a cold, calculating judgment, it was a strange fancy of both parties. But judged by this test, how many marriages would be pronounced "suitable?" Not one in a hundred, perhaps. The lovers talked of love and not of marriage. This was a step yet future and to be considered. Both were orphans. Perhaps this was at first the subtle attrac- tion between them. Both of them were possessors of a large fortune in their own right; both had been reared in fine society, and both had had pretty equal educational advantages. But Mr. Nesbitt was a Baptist, Miss Mordaunt a Cath- olic-the very subject upon which above all others, those who propose to walk together along the path of life should be agreed. Yet as " human love is not the growth of human will" we could not look for these two ardent, loving natures to govern their hearts by prudential considerations. "Mudder, may I go fly my kite?" asked Tommy Car- nahan, a little lame Irish boy, of his mother, who was endeavoring to put to sleep his little sister, a restless babe of eighteen months.         t     368       Evangel Wiseman. "Yaas Tommy, sure,. Be kerful and don't get hurt, me son," was the kind mother's quiet reply. Mike Carnahan was a daily Irish laborer, Sober, indus- trious and thrifty. He lived on the very outskirts of the city of Chester, where he had purchased for his family a snug little frame house and lot large enough for the cow and pig.   . As Tommy unwound his kite-string, he gazed at the long line of buggies and carriages he observed ,coming up the road, in the direction of the town. "Nobody dead, be shure," said Tommy to himself. "This is not the way for funerals, and 'sides, I see no hearse. I'm so glad none body's dead," Tommy solilo- quized, "I'm so sorra for the folks what dies." Just then the first buggy came up. Tommy let loose his kite, which the stiff breeze made flutter fearfully. The horse took fright, darted on a few steps aad then suddenly wheeled, as if to return. The vehicle was upset, and the gentleman and  lady thrown out against the embankment. It was the work of a moment. The gentlemeh from the other buggies sprang to the ground and ran to the rescue. The horse with one lunge had broken loose and was running down the road. Right- ing the buggy, William Nesbitt -sprang to his feet. Miss Mordaunt lay insensible; having been jammed against the embankment. "Tell me, is she dead?" he shrieked, as, springing to her side, he realized she did not move. The gentlemen bore her to Mike Carnahan's cottage and laid her on a bed. Mr. Wiseman drove as fast as he could for the physician. Entering on Clay street, he met Dr. Bassonett and Dr. Rives. Giving them minute directions, they jumped into   Lights and Shadows Interlaced.     369 bis buggy and hastened out, telling him to call at the drug store and provide -himself with suitable remedies which they named, and come out on the street car. Oh, the suspense and anguish of that hour to that hitherto joyous party, who can depict it! And to him, whose life was bound up in that of the suddenly-crushed flower, -poor William  Nesbitt,--justf as the joys of requited love, in all their measureless expan- sion, had become his beatific possession, to have all promises; swept away in a moment, was more than he could bear. He fell on the pulseless form as it lay in its peerless beauty before him; but he uttered not a word, not a moan--his was that silent agony which reaches the heart--finding no escape through the physical man, it concentrates in the inmost being, and saps up the fountain of life itself. Friends removed him   gently and carried him  to-the little parlor, and placed her on a low bed. Then the ladies quickly undid the habit, and chafed hands and limbs most vigorously. "She lives! thank  Godl" exclaimed Evangel, as she placed her hand on the heart, whose beatings, though slow and feeble, were yet decided. A look of joyous surprise passed over the face of all present. "She lives! gasped Annie Chiles in the ear of the appa- rently senseless form of Willie Nesbitt. "Who lives?" he shrieked, springing up to his feet, as if from a torturing dream. "Miss Mordaunt." "Thank   God! thank God!" and  he leaned on the bosom of Mr. De Witt and wept like a child. His kind friend drew him to the little bed, and putting his arms around him, pressed him to his bosom as if he had been a tender girl.           24     370       Kivanget wztsemrun.- It was a little act, but. it spoke with the voice of power to the hearts of all present. Men turned aside and wiped the tears from their faces, while the females wept aloud. i "Does she live, De Witt? does she live? tell me the truth; do not deceive me!" he asked after a minute's pause. "Yes, William, she lives, and breathes regularly."  3 "What does the doctor say?" EHe has not yet come, Willie, but we look for him every moment."                . Just then the buggy drove up, and the physicians, spring- ing from it, ran into the house. "She lives," said Dr. Bassonett to Dr. Rives, as he bent over her and caught her faint breathings; "but sheje is wholly unconscious. We must make a quick examina- tion." All were sent from the room but Mrs. Falkland, Mrs. Everett and Evangel. Removing everything from, the form that could impede progress, the two physicians proceeded to examine her closely. They found her severely injured, yet there was j hope. Mr. Wiseman came in with the restoratives, which were immediately applied. The system answered to them, which gave the physicians great hope. At length Miss Mor- daunt slowly opened her eyes, but they quickly closed again. Consciousness had not yet returned.' Every favorable symptom was immediately made known to Willie Nesbitt. But the shock upon his mental fac- ulties had been so fearful that it seemed impossible for his mind to react. "Thank God, thank God," was all he could say, as he lay on the bosom of his friend. Dr. Bassonett came into the parlor. As soon as he recog-   Lights  and Shadows Interlaced.   371 nized his presence he sprang up, and clasping him by the arm, asked, "Does she live, Doctor? Will she live?" "We hope she will. She is breathing much more freely, and gives several favorable indications of returning life." 4"Thank God, thank God!" he ejaculated, as he stood grasping the arm of the sympathizing physician. Great tears came to the eyes of Dr. Bassonett and rolled freely down his cheeks. Long years since he had been called upon, under circumstances very similar to the pres- ent, to yield up the idol of his heart, just on the eve of marriage. From that day, life had been a duty to the riven heart. No star had evyer risen in his pathway to shed light and hope. And no one present could so fully enter into the feelings of the sufferer as did the kind bachelor physician on whose arm he leaned for support. "Can't she be removed home, doctor?" asked Mrs. Falkland of Dr. Rives, as the doctor was preparing  a bandage for the fractured limb; " if possible, let it be done." "Perhaps better now than later, madam. -Send some one for a large spring wagon with cover, or without, if the other cannot be procured readily." The vehicle was soon at the door.1 As they gathered around the bed to move it, the young girl opened her eyes and whispered: -"Where am  I, where am I?" Mrs. Falkland bent over her and replied, cheerfully:. "All right, Maud, your friends are with you. Go to sleep." The voice reassured the young girl; she seemed incapable of further thought, and again sank into a state of perfect quiet. Tenderly they bore her to Mrs. Falkland's, and into the beautiful room which she had that morning left so full of life and hope.     Evangel Wiseman.                    Lig What a striking contrast! "Doctor," said Mrs. Falkland to Dr. Bassonett who remained while Dr. Rives went away for a short time to look after another patient, "Doctor, you must spare no pains to restore her. Let nothing be left undone. If necessary, you or Dr. Rives, or both, remain with her all night." The doctor bowed assent. How vividly that night- watch, seventeen years ago, came up before his mind! How he lived over that scene, when, as the first grey dawn of the morning came into the chamber where he, with the mother, bent over the helpless form of his heart's idol, the large blue eyes had slowly opened, the lips murmured: "I love you, Edwin-farewell. I go to"- and the sweet spirit went out from their presence, never more to return. Would it be so now? Quietly the stricken one lay on that soft, snowy bed. The mashed foot had been skillfully bandaged; the broken wrist bound up, and the contusion on the left side of the head carefully dressed. "She must be kept very quiet, Mrs. Falkland. Her life depends on this. You watch beside her; I will return in the course of an hour and remain through the night." As he was stealing from  the room, the young girl looked up into the face ofher friend, and whispered faintly; "Where is he?" "Who, the doctor, Maud?" " Willie." "He is below, in the parlor." "May I see him?" "I will see." And Mrs. Falkland followed Dr. Basso- nett and asked him. "Not now, Mrs. Falkland. It would be too much for   her nerves. Tell her after a while, and let her inhale a little of that chloroform." The young girl looked up so anxiously into the face of her friend. "May I?" she said, feebly. "Not now, Maud. The doctor says you may very soon, you could not bear it now. Here, inhale this." "But I may die before morning! Do let me see him now !  "No, Maud, you will not die. Be still now, and try to sleep. Willie shall come up when you awake." "Don't let him leave the house. You know I may not live to see the day, and if I am to die, let him be near me -let him be near me!" It was with the greatest effort she pronounced these words, but she was resolute, and would speak it out. "He shall stay, Maud, and shall come to you just as soon as you are able to see him. Be quiet now, and Willie shall see you soon." She faintly whispered "yes," and gently closed her large, sad eyes. "Will she live? will she live, doctor?" asked Mr. Nes- bitt, as he sprang to the door to intercept Dr. Bassonett, before he should leave, " Only tell me she will live! ' and the young nman grasped the arm of the kind physician, and looked so imploringly into his face, that he felt com- pelled to speak hopefully. '" She is doing very well under the circumstances, Willie," replied the doctor, cheerfully.  "I think there is hope." "She will not die to-night?" and the grasp on the arm became stronger. " No, no, she will certainly live, it may be for several days." "Thank God! thank God! but doctor, do not go. May I see her soon?"     374       Evangel Wiseman. "When her nerves recover from  the dreadful shock. It would be too much now. I hope she will sleep until I return." "I'm dying now," said Maud, opening her eyes wearily. "Let Willie come, I want to see him once more.- All in the world I have' to love. Please, let him come!" Mrs. Falkland was terror-stricken. She ran down stairs as fast as she could. The door had just closed on the form of the doctor. She rushed to it, opened and called to him: "Come, oh, come quickly, doctor, I beseech you! Maud She remembered Willie's presence, and left the sentence unfinished. The doctor comprehended the situation. As he reached the hall, Willie Nesbitt was ascending the stairs. ' Do not, Nesbitt, as you value her life!"The young man paused. "You must not see her now, Nesbitt," he said hurriedly, as he leaped by him up the steps. "Wait here, I'll be back in a few minutes." "Dying, doctor, let me see him," she faintly whispered as he stood beside her. Dr. Bassonett placed his finger on her pulse, and exam- ined her closely. "No, no, Miss Mordaunt, you are not dying, only the effects of the medicine Mrs. Falkland administered. Go to sleep now, and when you awake you'll be better. Then you shall see him." She sighed heavily. "Never awake!" she whispered to herself. "Never see him more." Dr. -Bassonett sat by her, holding her hand, until she fell into a calm sleep. How like that night when he had held another hand through its painful hours, and seen the loved one sink into the sleep of death!   Lights and Shadows Interlaced.      375 Dr. Bassonett was a Christian, a firm believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, and a believer in prayer. And as his finger pressed the feebly-beating pulse, he lifted up his heart in silent supplication to God to spare the life of the beautiful being before him, and to lead her in the way of eternal life. How necessary that he who attends to the welfare of the- body, should also be able to give consolation to the soul Would that all the physicians throughout our land were men who " loved God, and believed in the Son whom He hath sent." "Tell Nesbitt she sleeps," whispered the doctor to Mrs. Falkland, who sat beside the open window, anxiously gazing upon the scarcely breathing form; "I'll remain beside her until Dr. Rives returns."     376       Evangel Wiseman. '                       . CHAPTER XXIV. BREV MR, NAILOM'S FIRST LECTURE-RESULTS, F the meeting of Rev. Mr. Earle had produced a deep and wide-spread impression throughout the community of Chester, what shall we say of the excitement caused by the Rev. Mr. Nailom's lecture on the "Church and its Proper Membership?" It was an auspicious time for Mr. Nailom., The mind of the whole community was aroused by the recent meet- ings to a consideration of religious subjects. Every one had been reached by the revival; now every one was to be awaked by Mr. Nailom's series of lectures. It was the very first time in its annals that Chester had been thus aroused. Never before in all its history had its quiet been disturbed by a lecture on a religious subject. It had lectures many, and lectures various, for Chester was a literary place, and its population wide-awake people; but never before had any one, save in the way of preach- ing, called the attention of the Chesterians to a consid- eration of denominational differences. No wonder then that the eclat attending the appearance of the stranger was of a character universal. And then, in addition to the theme,--the manner of presenting it,--the emphasis and certainty with which the reverend gentleman made his assertions,-his striking, if not eloquent epithets and illustrations--all aided to attract attention and develop curiosity. Throughout the following day, the lecture of the pre- ceding night was the topic of conversation on every street -   Rev. Mr. .Vailom's First Lecture.    3" corner, in all places of business, and in the social gather- ings throughout the city. The comments were as various as were the speakers that made them. The advocates of "infant baptism" were exultant. Never before had they heard the " covenant argument," so well and so .convin- cingly presented. Indeed they had not known it was so strong. The proof was unanswerable. What could' the "dippers" (as the Rev. Mr. Nailom sneeringly denomi- nated the Baptists) do now? They would have to give up the contest, and sink into their merited obscurity, for were they not only an A-b ab church, anyhow, as the distinguished lecturer had uniquely dubbed them, when he declared unhesitatingly ' that they had a history of only three hundred years at most--having sprung up -with the madmen of Munster, across the ocean, and with Roger Williams in America." What right had they, for- sooth, to claim anything " when all their pretensions were founded in bigotry and sectarianism?" Poor Baptists I Many of them did feel exceedingly crest. fallen. They did not believe what Mr. Nailom had posi- tively asserted; and yet, not knowing how to meet and refute it, they withered under the apprehension of the deep impression it must necessarily make in favor of Pedo- baptism, and against the truth as they held it. The advo- cates of the lecturer's basis were unspeakably gratified. Built up in their faith, they were fully assured that they were the true church-mlembers of that church which was formed? in the family of Abraham, and to which the prom- ises were all given, and to which they were forever ratified by the covenant oath of which circumcision was the seal under the old dispensation, and, under the new, ilifant baptism." Some of them demurred, however, from Rev. Mr. Nailom's unique assertion that the Baptists "were only an A-b ab denomination." q     378       Evangel Wiseman. Dr. Eaton, who had listened to this most remarkable dis- course with undivided attention, was fully aware of the effect it must necessarily have on the minds of all the hearers of Rev. Mr. Nailom. He was fully sensible of the seeming strength of the views advocated by the reverend lecturer, for he was painfully cognizant of how little know- ledge the people have of this covenant made with Abraham, even those who cling to it with such tenacity, and find in it the warrant for a practice which Baptists have in every age opposed as wholly unscriptural. He very wisely judged that most of that large audience possessed no rebutting testimony,-that many of them would not trouble themselves to look at the other side of the subject, but take it for granted that the Rev. Mr. Nailom spoke the truth in earnestness and fairness, and would become the advocates of what they did not under- stand, and lend their influence to a practice for' which they could produce no other other authority than that -derived from this new lecturer. "But there is a future," said Dr. Eaton to himself, as these thoughts revolved through his mind. So he had quietly taken notes of all the points made, and pointed expressions used by the reverend gentleman. Of all the troubled minds in Chester, Mr. Wiseman possessed the one most perturbed. He was worried beyond expression-a mental frame he rarely ever in- dulged. Professionally so engaged throughout the day, he had had no time to give to the consideration of the covenant question, in favor of which the Rev. Mr. Nailom had brought statements and arguments which had quite upset his usual equanimity. He was pretty sure they could be met and overturned, but who could do it? That was the fearful query. He felt that many, like him- ' "        '   ,'^i        .   Mr. Nailom's First Lecture.    379 self, were poorly posted in this view of the subject, and would not take the time nor trouble to look, into the merits of the question; and while they might not become converts to the practice of infant sprinkling, would nevertheless be forever in doubt as to their duty to oppose it as nowhere enjoined on the followers of the Lord Jesus-as a fearful error, which having crept in years ago, under the specious garb of baptismal regeneration, had never been repudiated by those who clung to the rite, while they denied the object. The fame of the great " champion of truth," Rev. Mr. Nailom, was borne on the wings of the wind, and the evening trains brought several members of the Methodist and Presbyterian persuasions, to be enlightened by his new and striking arguments. Even the Bishop was so moved by the glowing reports of the reverend lecturer's ability and wit, that he and his whole family decided to descend from the heights of Apostolic succession and go with the unchurchly multitude to listen to this wonderful setter forth of the tima-honored and churchly practice. I "Would that this man had come before that unfortunate discussion with Mr. Wiseman," the Bishop said to himself, as he turned away from a long talk with Rev. Mr. Peter- son and pursued his way down street to visit Mrs. Minden. His object was to induce this lady to attend the series of lectures, in the hope that she would be moved to return from the error of her way, to the faith her forefathers had qiuetly walked in for ages. He made visits of similar intent to all the lukewarm of his flock. "I tell you, Evangel, this Rev. Mr. Nailom is the smartest man I have ever listened to, if he is a Presbyterian; and I 'know he "will do immense good in this place; and mercy knows the people do sadly need to be taught the truth- !     380       Evangel Wiseman. running here after one thing to-day, and there after another to-morrow, instead of adhering to the old ways that all good people have ever walked in since the days of faithful Abraham. I am going the town over, and advise every- body to go, and it's my opinion that he will soon have to take the Masonic Hall. like your 'Brother Earle.' What a mercy this man has been sent to us to counteract the evil done by those meetings of his."     , "Aunt Delia, you pain me," replied Evangel, looking up from the book she was reading-"Bringling in Sheaves."- ' We should all desire to know the truth, and to obey it, but surely it is great injustice to say that Mr. Earle's meet- ings were productive of evil. Look how many were con- verted and brought into the different' churches. Our church was not the only one built up by his visit. As many as fifty have united with the two Presbyterian churches, and more than this number with the Methodists, and let us hope there are many more that have found Christ through his instrumentality, who have not yet publicly acknowledged Him."     . "Yes, but see how many have strayed off from the true church, and the Bible practices: Annie Chiles, Willie Nesbitt-poor fellow, I do wonder what he is about to- day-then there is Mr. Everett, and Mr. and Mrs. Dun- fries, and I don't believe Mr. Carlton would have joined you Baptists, if it had not been for this Mr. Earle. By the way, Evangel, I fear Lilly is about to fall in love with him." "Oh, I don't suppose so, Aunt Delia; but if she should, I cannot see that it would be a dreadful act, provided Mr. Carlton reciprocated her love." "Of course you don't, Evangel. But I tell you, I do. And I'm not going to have any more such nonsense about   Rev. Mr. .Nailom's First Lecture.    381 me. Lilly Vernon is cot going to marry Mr. Carlton, nor any other Baptist, while I live, that's certain." The door-bell rang, and Bridget Mahoney came running up,. bearing a note from Mrs. Falkland. Rev. Mr. Nailom kept himself quite secluded during the day, only the favored few being allowed access to his presence. He had rooms at Elder Dodge's--a man of deep piety and great influence, a firm believer in the doctrines of the Presbyterian Church, as all his forefathers were. Sincerely believing that faith true and scriptural, he had never for a moment, in all his long life, questioned either principle or practice, but had had sprinkled, at the proper time, and with the utmost solemnity, nine little Dodges-- all of whom had proved very circumspect on- that mo- mentous occasion-and had continued so ever since-save Billy, the fourth son. Billy possessed a little dodgetary streak, yet Billy was " a boy of promise." Billy had his own views of "the proper," which views he maintained, if possible, against all odds, rarely ever allowing himself to be brow-beaten out of an opinion, or thwarted in a. purpose. Sometimes circumstances were unmanageable and Billy had to yield, despite his better judgment; but Billy maintained "his own think." At the age of eleven months he had been brought for- ward for baptism, on which occasion he manifested a fearful proportion of the "Old Adam," by squalling very loud--kicking very hard, and pulling nurse's new hat with most unpardonable fury. Indeed he so far laid aside propriety as to try his three and a half new teeth on her hand. Which experiment was so vigorously admin- istered that the nurse quaked and cried "Och!" before     382       Evangel Wiseman. all the people, to the dire mortification of. all parties concerned. ' Now we must not infer that Billy Dodge--baby --was so mad. He only didn't want to be interfered with, that was all. Ever since this marked event-never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it--Billy had always pertinaciously manifested much of this same spirit of f let me alone." And notwithstanding all his lessons in the catechism, and the big box full of little green and blue and red cards given him by his Sunday school teacher,--and all of which he had learned by hearty- Billy Dodge didn't grow a whit tamer. His parents and teachers all hoped he would some day grow to be a 4 better boy," but Billy had dashed on through twelve summers and thirteen winters, and all the trousers and boots his parents could provide, and as far as the keenest- sighted could discover, he had n't improved a jot. "What a boy Billy Dodge is!" the neighbors would say. "I do wonder if any good will ever come of him?' The parents were anxious, and had dark forebodings about their young scion's future. But Billy Dodge dodged on here, there, and everywhere, and) kept a cheerful, happy heart, and didn't for a moment consider he was half as bad as folks thought. Nor was he. Full of life --positively inclined to enjoy himself- gifted -with inventive talent-and a good amount of self reli- ance, Billy was bound to make himself felt in his own sphere, which, owing to his unceasing activity, was every year widening. Billy attended the lecture with his father and mother. He didn't want to go one bit, but his father had thought it proper to take him along oto attend to any little matter that might come up.   Rev. Mr. .failom's First Lecture.    383 Billy was a little irate. He didn't like to push his way through the people to hand a pitcher of water to the pulpit. Whether he had remembrances of the font, I cannot say. Be that as it may, he came out in no very amiable mood, and as he was usually direct to the point, he commenced as soon as he reached the corner: "Well, I'll just tell you what it is. That Mr. Nailom is ,he very queerest man I ever saw stand in a pulpit, and I don't like him a bit." "Hush,- my son," interposed the, mother. But Billy "would lhave his say." "I don't see why he wants to talk so much about one thing. For my part I don't see why children are baptized, any how; it don't make them a bit better and it's not in the Bible any how; and as to all this talk about ' covenant' and ' circumcision,' it don't prove a thing. If Christ had wanted babies baptized He would have said so, and then there would not have been any of this long rigmarole about it. But he didn't want it done, so he never told anybody to do it. Men have just picked it up themselves." Mrs. Dodge had made several ineffectual attempts to quiet Billy. But Billy would have gone through if he had been sure he would have 'had to say all the catechism and commandments the next Sunday. Mrs. Dodge was shocked at Billy's fearful heterodoxy. "What would, he come to? Indeed he must study the catechism more faithfully, and Mr. Pe terson must talk to him. 'Twould never do to have him lost after this manner."' "I tell you, wife, we must have our children baptized," said Major Boswell, a staunch Presbyterian-a member of Rev. Mr. Peterson's church, to his wife, who was an uncompromising Baptist, and a member of Dr. Eaton's church. "We must have them all baptized, and that next     384       Evangel Wiseman. Sunday. It will never do to put off this duty any longer. I'll speak to Mr. Peterson about it this very evening, if I can see him." "No, Major, you must do no such thing. I'm not going to have my children baptized. They are as much mine as yours, and I don't believe one bit in infant sprinkling, What's the use of doing it now, you have put it off so long?" "Better late than never, wife." "But just think how it will look to take Nannie to be sprinkled. She is nine years old, and you a member of the church all the time. Why, Major Boswell, it's simply ridiculous." ' But, wife, you have never been willing, and I dislike to have it done in the face of your persistent opposition." "Nor am I willing now, Major. Not one particle more so than I have ever been, and I tell you I do not wish you to have it done." "But, wife, I am convinced it is my duty. Mr. Nailom showed me last night that I was bound by covenant obliga- tions to have it done." "What nonsense, Major, for you and Mr. Nailom to tell me that because the Jews were circumcised-children, servants, proselytes, and all-that I am to have my chil- dren sprinkled! And that, too, when you can't for your lives prove that sprinkling, has come in the stead of circum- cisionl Why, Major, circumcision was a national rite. The baptism of believers belongs entirely to the gospel dispensation. It is sheer nonsense to talk to me in this way, and unless you can bring a better reason than this, I tell you I'll never consent to have my children sprinkled?" "But listen, Annie, didn't Mr. Nailom show that as in Abraham's family all were circumcised, and that covenant was to last a thousand generations, and as sprinkling has   Rev. Mr. Nailom's First Lecture.    385 come in the room of circumcision, our babies should be baptized, as the Jew's babies were circumcised." "It matters not what he said, Major; it's an easy matter to talk, but Mr. Nailom's whole argument is just as flimsy as can be. I tell you-and I do wish you would read for yourself-that circumcision was a national rite, not a spir- itual sign at all, and only the male children were circum- cised; but all males, children or servants, had to submit to it. Now, let me ask you, where does the Bible say, or even intimate, that baptism has come in the room of circumcision? I tell you, Major, it is not in the Bible at all. Men have inferred it without the shade of a shadow of divine authority. And let me ask, if you and your church believe this, why do you sprinkle female babies? Only males were circumcised; and moreover, why don't you sprinkle the children of your servants? They were circumcised. It would be well, I think, to be consistent; that is, if error can be made consistent." "Oh, wife, don't talk so at random. I am conscientious in this matter, and feel that it is my duty to our dear children to have it done." "Well, I am conscientious in the matter, too, husband; and I feel it is my duty to see that it is not done." "Why, wife, what makes you talk so? One would think you had no respect for religion." "Infant sprinkling is no part of the religion of our blessed Saviour, Major. It is of man's invention, entirely, and does not belong to the Gospel dispensation. There is not one command for it, nor one example of it, in the'New Testament Scriptures-not one. Surely, if Christ had demanded it of religious parents, he would have told them in language too plain to be mistaken. Neither you, nor Rev. Mr. Nailom, nor any one else, can point to a 25     Evangel Wiseman.                   R single text where it is enjoined, nor to any example where it was practiced. And, as to your ' covenant' argument, it proves too much for your practice. There is, there can be no good resulting from sprinkling unconscious babies who know nothing of Christ, or the Gospel, or the rite that is administered; and I tell you, Major, I shall never con- sent to have our children sprinkled. If you do it, you do it in the face of my most violent opposition." " But, wife, didn't you hear what Mr. Nailom read from David respecting this covenant that God made with Abra- ham, and which " He commanded to a thousand genera- tions,,' and which "was for an everlasting covenant"? How can you lay this aside?" " Major Boswell, this was not a spiritual covenant; it was to Abraham as the 'father of the Jewish nationality,' and did not 4pertain to salvation." " Oh, wife, you mistake; it certainly did." Here, let us see. For my part I don't believe a word of it. I'll get my Bible and read, that you may be con- vinced what that covenant was. Do you remember where Mr. Nailom read ?" "Yes, yes; somewhere in Psalms." "But which Psalm? I didn't pay much attention, because I knew it didn't bear on the point he was trying to prove, at all-that is, that babies should be sprinkled because babies had been circumcised. There, Major, please hand me that Concordance; I can find the passage by the 'thou- sand generations,' which he quoted over and over so'any times. Now, Major, I want you to listen attentively to every word, for it is a shame for a man of your sense to be imposed upon by such a garbler of the Scriptures. Now, I will read the very words he read. Listen. 'He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth.   He hath remembered His covenant forever--the word which He commanded to a thousand generation, which covenant He made with Abraham, and His oath with Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant.'" "Yes, yes, wife, those are the very words, and see how strong they are. How will you ever get over them?" "Strong words, indeed, Major. But do you know what that covenant was that God made with Abraham, and confirmed to Isaac and Jacob for an everlasting covenant?" "Of course! It was a covenant that included all the children." "Included the children, how, Major? In the church?" "Of course, wife.   Did n't Mr. Nailom   show  that clearly ?" "Well, let me read you what David says this covenant was. I am surprised at your Mr. Nailom for endeavoring to deceive the people so. It is wicked in a man to act thus. And I am equally surprised that any one will sub- mit his judgment in a matter of such importanceto the mere dicta of another. Hear what God's word says. In plain unmistakable language it tells us what that cove- nant was, that Mr. Nailom left his audience to infer was of a spiritual nature:  'Saying, unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance, when there were but a few men in number, yea very few, and strangers in it.'" 'pTow, Major, this is the covenant that he read about and dwelt so long upon, and made so much out of in favor of infant sprinkling.  Isn't it a shameful imper- tinence for him to do so? You see the covenant was to give Canaan to the descendants of Abraham.   And now, let me ask you, are you going to have the children    388       Evangel Wiseman. sprinkled because God made .a covenant with Abraham to give his posterity the land of Canaan? It is simply nonsensical to talk and act so." "Oh, wife, you don't understand it; I tell you, it's my duty to have the children baptized, and I must do it." "Well, I beseech you, Major, if you must have it done, to find a better reason than that Mr. Nailom offers. I feel it is my duty to see that it is not done, because it is not commanded. I am  sure if Christ had thought it proper He would not have failed to enjoin it upon the apostles and His disciples." "But, Annie, it can do no harm if it does no good, and as long as it is the practice of my----church, I must conform to it." "I see, Major Boswell, that it does great harm. Your preachers administer, in the name of the triune God, as an ordinance of his appointment, a rite which is no- where taught in the Bible. And I think Christ will say to all who practice it, ' who hath required this at your hands?' As to its being a practice of your church, I would, if I 'were you, come out of a church that made it my duty to do in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit what is not commanded by either." "But, Annie, I tell you I am conscientious in this matter!" ' And so, Major, am I." "But they are ,my children, Annie, and I must do what I believe to be right with them." "And they are my children too, Major. Shall H not do with them what appears to me to be light?" But, Annie, I cannot, for my life, see this question as you do. As look at it, I am forced by my love to our children to have them baptized."   Rev.

You will do it in face of my solemn protest, and I will not see it done. And more- over, I tell you now, if you do have them sprinkled, I will make the last one of them Baptists. Remember this, will you? The last one of them shall be baptized for himself and herself, if they shall live to be converted." Mrs. Boswell spoke with an earnest determination that surprised the Major, while it amused him. "Will you go to the lecture to-night, Annie?" asked the Major, pleasantly. His point gained, he could well afford to be very agreeable. "Indeed, I will, Major, and pay good attention, too, I warrant you. I shall watch your Mr. Nailom  closely. And when he gets through, you will find that he has po authority in the world for baby sprinkling, and rui ishow  you this from  his own words. You see how tricky he was last night with his covenant argument. I should think you would not have any confidence in him after that. He thinks to have it all his own way, Major, but I'll tell your Mr. Nailom  that he's being watched very closely. 'There's a chiel amang ye takin' notes, and faith he'll print 'emn.' And so sure as you have my children sprinkled next Sunday, just so sure I'll have Mr. Nailom's arguments all upset, right here in this community. I can't do it myself, because I'm not allowed, nor do I wish to speak in public. But I'll get some one to come to Chester who will show up his grounds for baby sprinkling in the true light. And if I can't have this done, I'll reply to him myself through the Sentznel." The Major laughed outright at his wife's enthusiasm. "Why, Annie, what do you know   about these things?"     390       Evangel Wiseman. "Wait and see." As the day wore on the excitement increased. Persons  who had read a synopsis of the lecture without a second thought, learning what a wonderful man Mr. Nailom was, not only made ready to go themselves, but urged upon  others to attend. And when the bell sounded out on the  air, the people thronged the streets, wending their way to the church.   Varieties.         391 CHAPTER XXV. VARIETIES. jTfHE house was filled at an early hour. The lecturer entered, escorted by Revs. Kennelly, Peterson, Eagan, Mitchell, and Major Boswell.  He wore a mien of self-reliance which almost touched the border of gratified triumph. With air well-pleased he looked over the vast audience, then, seating himself in the pulpit, he adjusted his neck-tie to give himself latitude of vocal- ization, threw back his hair, flirted his white pocket handkerchief, which he drew forth from the side pocket of his rather worn black cloth coat,-and then, beckoning to Brother Dodge, who sat just in front of the pulpit, he stepped forward, whispered a few words in that gentle- man's ear, and re-seating himself, took another survey of the audience. As a consequence of the side chat with Brother Dodge, Billy Dodge, Jr., dodged out of the seat as soon as his father entered it, a huge frown on his face and a mountain of very impious " rebellion in his heart, and with quick, determined tread, sought the front door. The people continued to pour in until every space was filled with chairs and benches brought for their accommo- dation; so that when Billy Dodge returned he had great difficulty to reach the pulpit with his pitcher and glass, which by no means increased his amiability. The audience being seated, Rev. Mr. Eagan, at request of the lecturer, rose and offered a very short prayer.     392       Evangel Wiseman. The Rev. Mr. Nailom then came forward, and commenced his second lecture by a review of the first, urging, with more than his previous energy and enthusiasm,* his cove- nant argument in favor of infant sprinkling. He re-asserted that the Church-which term he did not define-was formed ini the family of Abraham; and as on the previous night, he dwelt on the covenant made by God with that patriarch, as related in Genesis, chapter 12: 1, 3, 7; and which was ratified to Abraham by the sign of circumcision, which he called the seal of the covenant. He did not read the covenant in either of these places, but turned immediately to Nehemiah 9: 7, and asking " that all give 'heed," read in a firm, full voice, the words: "Thou art the Lord, the God who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham, and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him"-and here he ceased to read, not telling what that covenant was, although the next words, without the intervention of even a comma, are: "to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girghashites, to give it, I say, to his seed; and hast performed thy words for thou art righteous." This is the same covenant as given in Genesis, 15; but the lecturer dared not read it in either place, but turned from this garbled extract, remarking: You see here, my friends, a grand confirmation of this covenant, which was *It was afterward ascertained that Rev. Mr. Nailom had carefully prepared twelve lectures against the Baptists, which he delivered at such places as might be desired, at the rate of $8 per lecture. Thus he defended the Pedo-Baptist practices of sprinkling and infant sprinkling against the "dippers," as he denominated the Baptists, and their a-b ab churches.     Varieties.         393 repeated to David,* as we find here in the 105th Psalm" -to which place he turned, and in an elevated tone, and with marked emphasis, he read: "He is the Lord our God. His judgments are in all the earth. He hath remembered "-and here the lecturer raised his voice so high that it filled every portion of the house-"He hath remembered His covenant forever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations, which covenant He made with Abraham, and His .oath unto Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant." And here the Rev. Mr. Nailom paused in his reading and closed the Bible. Mrs. Boswell gave the Major la fearful nudge, as she held the small open Bible before his face, and pointed to the words which immediately follow, and which embody the covenant of which he said circumcision was the seal, and which he affirmed put infants into the church formed in Abraham's family, and now puts infants into the Gospel church, as infant sprinkling had taken the place of circum- cision. The covenant is in these words: "Saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance." t "Are you going, Major, to have our children sprinkled on this covenant made with Abraham to give his seed the land of Canaan?" she whispered naively in his ear. The Major reddened and shook his head for her to be silent, but replied not a word. "You see clearly, my friends," resumed the Reverend lecturer, " that this covenant, made by Almighty God to Abraham our father, was an everlasting covenant, was commanded for a thousand generations." \ * Psalm 105: 7, 10.        Psalm 105:2.     394       Evangel Wiseman. ,Ask him, Major, to read that covenant. We wish to know what it is. The people do not know. And I am fearful they are under a wrong impression as to its prom- ise," archly whispered Mrs. Boswell to her husband. Another shake of the head, and a deeper reddening were the only manifestations of reply the amused Mrs. Boswell received. "Circumcision was a seal of this covelnant, my hearers, and was for the children, the infants- the babies, those that s-u-c-kl-e-d." And the Reverend gentleman spelt out this word vith great gusto. "Ask him if it was for the girl-babies as well as for the boys, Major." And Mrs. B. smiled most provokingly-at least we judge the Major thought so, from the look of dis- approbation that settled on his face. "Therefore, children were included in the covenant that God made with Abraham," continued Mr. Nailom most earnestly, " this covenant that he swore unto Isaac and con- firmed unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant. They were a part of the church established in the family of the patriarch, were put in by the positive law. of God, and only the positive law of God can take them out. No man dare infer them out. It would be presumptuous to do so. Now, it is evident that if the children of believers were placed in the church by the positive command of Almighty God,-and we have shown flat they were,- you have just as much right to exclude believers from that qchurch as you have to exclude the children of be- lievers." "This same positive law put in ' every man's child' which was born in Abraham's house, or bought with his money, Major. Who has put out servants and servants' children? How have they been inferred out? And you know- that   Varieties.          395 every one not circumcised was to be cut off from his people. Can it- be that the unsprinkled children are also cut off?" -The Major's face grew very serious. His wife's side arguments puzzled him dreadfully. There was good rea- soning in them, and after all, he was forced to feel that the ,' covenant argument" did prove, as his wife had told him, almost too much for the practice of the church. If infant sprinkling had come in the room   of circumcision,-- and this he must heartily believe,-why were females sprinkled, and the servants and their children left un- sprinkled? It was not a legitimate supplanting if the law was a positive one. Yet he must have his children baptized the very next Sunday. hie had made up. his mind to this, and dared not turn aside from his purpose. Moreover, he had promised his pastor, Rev. Mr. Peterson, that it should be done; and he would not appear vacillating. But this was a material covenant of which circumcision was the seal. This fact could not be denied. Then why baptize infants for a spiritual purpose? While all these upsetting thoughts were passing through the Major's mind, thrown out by his intelligent Baptist wife, the Pedo-Baptist portion of that large assembly were most delightedly taking in all that the lecturer offered them, deeming his proof entirely conclusive in favor of his posi- tion, a' that the infant of a believing parent is a scriptural subject of Christian baptism." Many of the Baptists were quite aroused. They had never heard the practice of infant baptism so handled before, and they were not at all prepared to refute the lecturer's premises or conclusions. Had they, as Mrs. Boswell had done, looked at the subject for themselves, they would most readily have discovered the fallacy of the whole proposition.     396       Evangel Wiseman. Mr. Wiseman was one of the perplexed number. When he was about to marry an Episcopalian, he prepared him- self to defend his cause against the heterodox tenets of that church. But the Presbyterian view had never before par- ticularly engaged his mind; and the boldness of Mr. Nailom, together with his emphatic reiterations and shrewd management of the argument founded on circumcision, somewhat disconcerted him. Evangel was entirely won over to the side of the lecturer, and felt for the first time, almost certain that it was her duty to have her child sprinkled. Miss Delia was triumphant. At last infant baptism had been found in the Bible, and soon Vernon would be baptized, in that beautiful robe and becoming cap, and all the world would see the triumph of the church and its teachings over Baptist ignorance and bigotry. And then, should the little darling be snatched away from this world, it would be sure of heaven. Miss Delia was un- speakably happy in the contemplation of the beautiful' picture her imagination had painted, and a smile of deepest satisfaction rested on her face. "A hard struggle I have had-hard, very hard!" she said to herself, "but it will all be right in the end.' And she nodded the most decided approval of what Mr. Nailom was just then saying about the covenant for a thousand generations. Dr. Eaton sat unobserved, taking full notes of all the Reverend lecturer was pouring forth with such emphatic reiteration. Readily perceiving and appreciating the effect such assertions, uncontradicted, must have on the minds of the uninformed, he felt the necessity for having the errors refuted. And he was determined they should be, at the right time and in the proper manner. It was a ground over which he had been called fully to pass once before, in a controversy with a Methodist   Varieties.         397 minister, and he knew each step of the way; and had it not been for the rudeness of the act, he would have risen in that large audience and requested Mr. Nailom to read David's words, in which this covenant was distinctly set forth. "Now I have shown you, my friends, that the church of God was set up in the family of Abraham when God made the covenant with that patriarch. And I now call your attention to the following propositions, which I affirm without fear of contradiction: 1. Abraham and his seed were divinely constituted a true, visible church of God. "2. The Christian church is identical with this Jewish church; that they are one and the same church in different dispensations. "3. That Jewish circumcision before Christ, and Chris- tian baptism after Christ, are one and the same seal, though in different forms. "4. The administration of this seal to infants was never prohibited by divine authority. "And now you see, from these propositions, which no man will dare to deny, that there is a divine command (if not expressed in the commission,) for the baptizing of infants. "And now, my friends," continued the lecturer, "after this very general outline of the covenant, which shows you so plainly that infants were included in the Church of God under the Old Testament dispensation, let me prove toyou that there was a church set up in the family of Abraham. We all know there are certain character- istic features necessary to a church-state: "1. A church must have the oracles of God. "2. It must have ordinances.     398       Evangel Wiseman. "3. It must have officers.   - "4. It must have members. ' 5. It must have worship and discipline. "And now for my first proposition: 'A church must have the oracles of God.' Did the seed of Abraham possess these?"Here Rev. Mr. Nailom read from Deut.  30: 19: "' I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live," etc.; and Deut. 82: 46: "And Moses said unto them, 'set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law." He also read Neh. 9: 13, 14; Psalm 68: 5, 3; Psalm 148: 19, 20; Acts 7: 38; Romans 3: 1, 2: ' What advantage then hath the Jew, or what profit is there of circumcision? Much every way; for unto them  were committed the oracles of God.' "This language of Paul is decisive, my friends. So we see that the Jewish Church had the oracles of God as much as the Christian Church. Thus far, then, they ,are identical. ' Secondly, I call your attention to the ordinances. I will not now say anything about the ordinance of circum- cision, which, though not a social ordinance of worship, was nevertheless an ordinance divinely appointed to the seed of Abraham. . First, we see the ordinance of the Pass- over. This ordinance was instituted by the Lord Himself; it was to be kept forever in all the generations of Israel. It was a social ordinance, a church ordinance, a significant ordinance. The second ordinance enjoined was the 'feast of unleavened bread,' a social ordinance and a holy coMivo- cation." Here the the lecturer read Exodus 12: 15, 20,   Varieties.          399 to show the institution of what he denomninated a signifi- cant commemorative social ordinance of divine worship. ' The next ordinance that I shall mention is the ordinance of the Sabbath. 'Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you.' ' Six days' work may be done, but on the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord, whosoever doeth any work on the Sabbath day he shall surely be put to death.'--Ex. 30: 14, 15. "The next ordinance or religious festival appointed was the--feast of weeks, or, as it is called, the feast of Pente- cost, an account of the institution of which you will find in Lev. 23: 15, 21. "The next is the feast of Tabernacles.-Lev. 23: 33, 43. "The next is the great feast of Expiation.-Lev. 16: 29, 31.         "To these I might add feast of Trumpets, of New Moons, of Purim, etc. I have shown you conclusively that the Jews had church ordinances. "' My third proof is that they had officers of churches. By officers I mean those who rule and officiate in the worship of a church. And here, in this church we find set up in the family of Abraham, we see Elders, Levites, Priests,- and Scribes. Of these various officers of the church I will not now speak at length. You can read for yourselves of their being set apart for the special duties of their respective offices, by referring to the Num. 11: 16, 17, 24, 25; Num. 8: 5, 16, 24, 26; Ezra 7: 6. "My fourth, proof of the existence of the Jewish Church, is its membership. There were persons professing the wor- ship of the one only living and true God. I need not cite Scripture to prove this point. It is patent to all. Even in the darkest and worst period of the apostacy of this Jewish Church,-- I have reserved unto myself seven     400       Evangel Wiseman. thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.' "5. They had their worship-a book of psalms. They had their courses of singers; they had their musical instru- ments; their social prayers and social praises. "Thus you see, my friends, that Abraham and his seed constituted the church of the Old Dispensation, having the oracles of God, ordinances, officers, members, and worship. And moreover, they received by divine inspi- ration the very name 'church.' They are called the 'Church of the Lord,' ' of Jehovah,' both in the Old and New Testaments. Let us look at it in the Old, as applied to the seed of Abraham. It is first found in Deut. 9: 10: ' And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, and on them was written according to all the words which the Lord spake unto you on the mount on the day of the assembly,' or church. In the Septuagint Greek it reads thus: 'hemera ekkle- sias,' in the day of the church. In Dent. 18: 16, we have, 'in the day of the assembly,' the words being the same as in the tenth verse of. the ninth chapter, 'te hemera tes ekklesias,' 'in the day of the church.' We find the same word in Judges 21: 5; also eighth verse of same chapter; also in Joshua 8: 35, and 1 Sam., 17: 47. In 2 Chron., 29: 28, 32, it occurs three times; in Neh. 13: 12. It frequently occurs in Psalms. I will now read you from the New Testament. In Acts 7: 38, 39, Stephen says: "This is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel, a prophet will the Lord raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me, him shall ye hear. This was he that was in the church in the wilderness.' In Heb. 2: 12, the Apostle Paul cites the 22d Psalm, 22d verse, thus: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praises unto thee.'   Varieties.         401 "cNow, I have shown you, my friends," -and the speaker wore a most self-satisfied air,--"that the seed of Abraham, both in the old and New Testaments, in their associated state are called a church-the church of the Lord. I have also proven that a positive law of God put children into this church. There they are. Who will dare to infer them out? God has put them into the church, by positive enactment. And as the church in the wilder- ness, or the Jewish church, and the Christian church are same in different dispensations, children have a right to be in the church, now,- the gospel church. And, as circum- cision was the seal or initiating rite for the Jewish church, baptism, which has come in its place, must be applied to infants of believing parents. And now, having proved my proposition clearly to you all, no man will be so rash as to say, ' I have not done so.' I affirm my first propo- sition, which is, that the infant of a believing parent is a scriptural subject of infant baptism.' And now, let him who dares disobey the will of God refuse baptism to his child." The effect of the speaker's logic and manner was elec- trical. All went away either convinced or puzzled, save Dr. Eaton, and Mr. Everett, and two or three other Bap- tists of cool heads, who had carefully studied and sifted the "covenant argument." Mrs. Wiseman was fully con- vinced; Miss Delia exultant. When she reached home that night, she took up the robe and cap, to see that they were just as they should be, for she felt assured that Vernon would be baptized the following Sabbath. "Well, what have you to say now, Herbert?" she remarked most animatedly to Mr. Wiseman, when that gentleman entered the dining room next morning to breakfast, and, with a grave countenance, seated him- 26     JEvangel Wiseman. self at the table. You'll consent, now, won't you? You are convinced that infants should be baptized! Oh, I knew it was in the Bible; I always told you so. Only I wonder Dr. Cheney didn't find it. Say, shan't Vernon be baptized next Sunday morning at our church? I will take no denial." "Not next Sunday, aunty." "And why not? Did any one ever see such a perverse man?   Fully convinced of his duty and won't do it! Afraid to do what the Bible commands. Oh, Herbert, you sin against light and knowledge!" cEvangel, what do you say?" " I leave it all to Herbert, aunty." "Now, you see! Certainly you won't refuse any longer. Everything is ready. I looked at the gown and cap last night. And the little darling is well again. But Herbert" --and here Miss Delia's voice assumed a very significant tone,-" if you should fail now to do your duty, you may expect to be sorely chastised." " And what is my duty, aunty?" 4 To have Vernon baptized next Sunday morning." " I do not see it so." "And why not?" "Because I have not studied this question of the church and covenant as Mr. Nailom presented them; and I will not act until I am satisfied." And if you are satisfied, will you act then?" " I will." Chester was in intense excitement throughout the day. All the conversations were of the lecture of the previous evening. How many discussions took place on the streets and in private, - how many rejoicings among the Pedo-   Varieties.   403   Baptists, and- how many doubts and perplexities among the Baptists,-it would be hard to say. About one o'clock of that day Mr. Wiseman was seen coming out of Mr. Chapman's book store, with a large package of books beneath his arm. He looked rather lugubrious. "See, Evangel," said Miss Delia, as she looked from the window and beheld Mr. Wiseman at the gate, "just see, will you,-was there ever such a man? Won't believe when he is convinced. Evangel Wiseman, I tell you, if you and Herbert neglect your duty to that child after this, you must expect and will receive some chastisement. I do feel so provoked. But I see the end of it all--that is if I do not do what I know to be right. Say, Evangel, s are you not ready to have Vernon baptized?" "Yes, Aunty, just as soon as Mr. Wiseman consents." "But if he doesn't consent?" 'Well, I don't know. I shall see about it." "See about it, Evangel? What, do you mean to delay until Vernon is lost. See about it, indeed! You must have it done! If Herbert won't consent, I repeat it, you must assume the responsibility yourself. Say, will you?" "I think Mr. Wiseman will consent, aunty, he is about convinced." "Don't you see that great roll of books, Evangel; I tell you, Herbert will get up opposition, if it is possible. Mark my words. The matter rests with you, for you are convinced, and Vernon is your child, and the Iord requires his baptism at your hands"      404       Evangel Wiseman.  CHAPTER XXVI. - SORROW CONTINUES FOR THE NIGHT.?1 XT( HE world measures life by years! the soul measures it by suffering! We live ages of joy or sorrow, often while the earth is passing through a very small por- tion of its orbit. The material cannot circumscribe the spiritual, nor space comprehend the infinite; and did we but realize the dignity of our origin, and the sublime heights to which the pure soul shall rise, how would this life of ours be made beautiful and grand by the cultivation., of the deity that is within us, instead of being as it is, frittered away over the trivialities of time and sense! But man gropes. He loves to grope, and will not throw off the shackles that bind, but rather clasps them, lest they may  fall. The soul shrinks from suffering, not willing to undergo the present sorrow, for the exceeding great joy to be attained. There is no law of our spiritual being more unalterably fixed, more necessary for our purification, than this law of suffering. -We cannot look up, we cannot live the truly good, we cannot take one step in the divine life, nor exercise any faith in the Redeemer of our souls, with- out the possession of this immutable principle. It is the quickener of thought, the lever that raises the soul, the fire that consumes the dross, the angel-finger pointing heaven- ward, the discipliner of faith, the begetter of joy, the moulder of patience, the fashioner of the far more exceed- ing and eternal weight of glory. How significant these words of Paul: That I may know   Sorrow  Continues for the Nzight.   405 Him and the power of His resurrection," and "The fellow- ship of His sufferings being made conformable unto His death." And again: "For it became Him,-in bringing many souls unto glory, to make the Captain of their salva- tion perfect through suffering." And again: "Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them (the prophets) did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow." We cannot be heirs of salvation without it. The "old man within us must be crucified." The path heavenward is not bedecked with earthly flowers, nor made glad by earthly joys. "Ye shall have tribulation," is the neqessary inheritance of all who shall be heirs with Christ of that glory yet to be revealed in us who are called by Hiis grace, and purified by His Spirit through afflictions. Willie Nesbitt did not, could not retire that night. Alone he sat, with his God, and like the patriarch, wrestled until the day dawned. It was a Peniel to his soul, for he had seen God by the eye of faith, and had communed with Him. Through the long still hours of that night of watching, alone in that dimly-lighted parlor, he had thought, and wept, and prayed. And when the morning came, it found him nearer heaven than he had ever been before. He real- ized the momentous question of life and of death, the responsibilities of the one, the seriousness of the other. He felt, too, in the depths of his being, how helpless man is, and again, how mighty and able to save is He, who was, and is, and is to come. The conflict had been dreadful,-the ordeal fiery,-the iurnace seven times heated, but he had come forth victor, without the smell of fire on his garments. Henceforth ;he world to him was to be the theater of kind and noble     406      .Evangel Wiseman. deeds, mankind his brother, his life a joyous sacrifice to Him who had redeemed him. Having rescued him from the, grasp of Satan, and called him into His vineyard, Christ had a work for him to do, so he saw fit to prepare him for it by this dread catastrophe which had befallen him. On some souls the strokes fall gently-the process of preparation is silent and gradual. On others the bolts descend with the fierceness of Sinai's wild stormings, and the Christian warrior steps forth girded and panoplied for the fight. The latter was the experience ofour young friend. The patient slept. Faint moanings at irregular intervals escaped her. When Dr. Rives returned, and found her resting quietly, he forbore further examination, and con- sulting with Dr. Bassonett, the two decided to leave all to nature until the morning. The' latter remained by the couch of the sufferer. There was great fear of sudden un- favorable developments, which, if promptly and judiciously met, might be controlled, but which, if neglected, might result in speedy death. Both physicians thought the contusion on the head was not fearfully serious. They could not see that it involved the brain. Yet not having had opportunity for a minute examination, they were somewhat in doubt as to the con- dition of the wound and the probable results. There was suffering in some part of the body, for the sleeper moaned with pain. It might perchance be the arm, or perhaps the foot, which was badly crushed. Mrs. Falkland watched with all the love and anxiety of a devoted heart. She had known Maud when she was a child;-had loved her parents dearly when they had lived as neighbors in New Orleans. And now that the orphan was left with no one to supply the place to her of   Sorrow  Continues fov the Night.   407 her fond mother, her generous soul felt that she should step in and fill the vfuum, as far as she could. Maud Mordaunt's mother had died and left her to the care of an aunt-in-law, when the young girl was in her fifteenth year. The father had died seven years previously. This aunt did not care to be troubled with her charge, having eight children of her own to attend to, so Maud was placed in the convent of the Sacred Heart in Philadelphia, and had remained there until she completed her eighteenth year. She had passed one winter in New Orleans' fash- ionable society, the belle of the season, for she was beau- tiful and wealthy and most agreeable in manner. Having received an invitation from Mrs. Falkland, her mother's friend, to pass the summer with her, she readily accepted, glad to escape the drain of city life on her time and health. Maud Mordaunt was a Catholic from education. Her school-life in the convent had convinced her mind that Catholicism was a beautiful religion, and as it was the Mother Church, it must-being the oldest-be the true Church. The endeavor of the nuns had been to win her to become a nun, that her immense wealth might be at their disposal. But she had been too long free, loved life too well, and was not of that superstitious cast of mind to be operated on through her fears. Her parents had been members of no church, neither were her uncle and aunt. After leaving the convent, she had passed the summer with a young friend in Western New York, returning in the early fall to enter society, and pass the winter in fashionable life. At first it had met her highest expecta- tions, and' she was wildly intoxicated with its fascina' tions; but soon it began to pall on her taste, and at length     408       Evangel Wiseman. she felt herself surfeited. It was a bubble, she saw, gilded and beautiful, but hollow and ever ready to burst. She had had a number of admirers, for her beauty and wealth were both great attractions, but she understood the why of the manifest devotion, and had failed to reciprocate. In every instance her heart had remained untouched, and she reached Chester, mistress of her affections, her time and her means. Willie Nesbitt, from the introduction, had attracted her attention. He was so perfectly natural, possessed such a genuine flow of spirits, and was so free from the self- imposed restraints that most young gentlemen take upon themselves, to hide their defects, and thus blind the eyes of those whose esteem they desire to win. And then, too, he was parentless like herself. The sympathy called forth by this similarity of condition was at first a strong bond of union between the two. Friendship had rapidly ripened into love, ardent and unchangeable. Never did woman receive purer idolatry than William Nesbitt bestowed on her whom he had chosen for his wife. The joy of that ride home was a volume of beauty. The sorrow of that night of darkness was a volume of unspeakable anguish. Sudden and striking contrast, each heightening the other by antithesis. Wearily the night wore on; each hour bore its burden of fearful anxiety. Each hour was a life-period to Wil- liam Nesbitt. He lived more than he had done in all the years that were passed. It was the Red Sea and the Wilderness between the earthly Egypt and the spiritual Canaan,-the conflict with the powers of darkness, in which he triumphed gloriously, through Him who had redeemed him.  Softly the morning light stole into the quiet room of   Sorrow  Continues for the Night.   409 the sufferer. She opened her eyes as if from a deep sleep, and looked inquiringly around. "Where is he?" she asked in a faint voice, fixing her eyes on those of Mrs. Falkland, who bent over her. "I thought he was here; you told me he might come." "And so he shall, Maud, in a little while. 1 will call Dr. Bassonett, and he will tell us if you can see him." "Let me see him," she replied quickly. "I am strong now." Mrs. Falkland proceeded to the adjoining chamber, and aroused Dr. Bassonett from his short slumber. He came, and found his patient more composed. The pulse beat more regularly, the breathing was more natu- ral. So he gave orders for a little nourishment. "Doctor, you said he might come. Willie,-may I see him? I dreamed he was dying. Does he live, or are you deceiving me?" "He is well, my girl," replied the Doctor in a voice as tender as a woman's. In the parlor below he is waiting to be summoned to see you." "Then let him come, won't you? You know he is all I have to love in this world. And I may die without seeing him. I'm strong enough now." Her look was so full of her heart's love--her eyes so beautifully beseeching- her voice, so like that of a pleading child, that Dr. Bassonett could not keep back the tears of admiration and sympathy. Tender chords that long had slept, were touched and vibrated thrillingly to the sentiment of the moment. "You shall see him, child, you shall, as soon as you have taken some nourishment," replied the doctor, bend- ing over her and stroking back the soft rich hair from her high, full brow, now as white and polished as the dressed marble.     "O       Evangel Wiseman. "A: little patience, my child," and the Doctor sooth- ingly passed his hand over her brow, with the gentle touch of a loving mother. "You shall see Willie soon, we will not deceive you." Mrs. Falkland entered the room with the bowl of nour- ishment, which Maud took with great delight. "Now," she said, as her friend turned from her side, "now, Doctor, he may come." Dr. Bassonett tripped down as lightly as he could, and softly approached the divan where the young man lay. He started up, but spoke not. "You may come now, Willie," he said pleasantly. "She asks to see you." The shock was so great that the tired frame could scarcely support itself. So he leaned on the arm of his friend and ascended the stairway. The door opened. Maud started, while a glorious light flashed into those weary eyes, and she put forth her hand. Willie reached the bedside, he knew not how, and bending low over her, kissed the beautiful lips. Oie arm was thrown around him-the other lay motionless by her side. Again and again he kissed her lips, her face, her brow. Not a word was spoken. It was a joy too deep for utter- ance. The full round arm relaxed its pressure and fell on the bosom. The love-lit eyes closed. The young man was withdrawn to the sofa on the farther side of the room. He wept like a woman. \."        , ' t.,   Resolves--The Venture.       4" CHAPTER XXVII. RESOLVES- THE VENTURE.  HE covenant argument was quite exhausted by the Rev. Mr. Nailom. No phase of it was left unpre- sented. Touched up after his manner of argument- ation, which was sui generis, it most firmly built up in the ancient faith all the Pedo-Baptists of Chester, of all sects, who nightly listened to the ad captandum logic of the wonderful lecturer. The unimformed Baptists were made to tremble when they considered what must be the effects of this series of discourses on the whole community. They were not convinced themselves, but they rightly inferred that others would be, and in their terror they for a while forgot that there are two sides to a controversy, and that oftentimes;,in the mouth of an unscrupulous declaimer "the worse is made to appear the better reason.) Mr. Nailom must be met. It would never do to let such assertions and such arguments remain unrefuted. Persons would not search for the truth themselves, but could it be given by some one who had investigated the subject, and found out the fallacies of the "covenant argument." they would receive it, and thus the .arms of error would be spiked. So Deacons West aid Leftwich and Marvin and Hawkins called the next morning after the second- lecture, on their pastor, Rev. Dr. Eaton, to present the case to him, as it bore on their minds. They found the Doctor in his study, busily engaged with his pen. They readily perceived, from the books lying around him     "2       Evangel Wiseman. open, that he was looking into the merits of some theolog-  ical question. He invited them in with a kindly greeting, for he at once understood the occasion of their early call. "Hard at work, Doctor? Sorry to interrupt you in your  labors," said Deacon Leftwich, who took it upon himself to speak for the others, " but the fact is, Doctor, we have come to see what ought to be done with this lecturer, the Rev. Mr. Nailom. You see he is taking the town by storm, and his bold assertions and garbled readings are having a most wonderful effect on all classes. The Pedo-Baptists, or rantists, they should be called, are pos- itively triumphant. And our people are cast down, for they readily understand if he goes on this way, unnoticed and unrefuted, that the multitudes will go with him, and our cause be left without support. Why, Doctor, there has never been a man in Chester that has made such a stir. We thought our people were aroused when Brother Earle was with us,- but I tell you the interest and excitement were not a circumstance to what they are now.. The brethren and I have come over to consult with youw to see what is best to be done in the case. That something must be done, and that quickly, is beyond question. But what will meet the demand, and, most fully and effectually present the truth to the minds of those already poisoned by his error, is the point to be decided upon." "You believe, then, Brother Hawkins, that 'truth is mighty and will prevail,"' remarked the Doctor pleas- antly. "Assuredly I do, provided we can get it before the minds of the people in such a manner as will be clear and convincing. We Baptists have the truth, there is no question of that; and what wewant is some one who can expose the sophistries of this lecturer, point out all his   Resolves-The Venture.       413 errors-in a word, undo all he has done, and then give the community the sure and plain teachings of God's word; and7 we thought perhaps you would do so, or suggest some one who will, as you are better acquainted with the ministers of our State than we are, and know who would do the most effective work for us-that is, if you will not undertake it yourself. We greatly prefer you if you are willing, for then our denomination will be known to have a champion here able to defend its truths and interests, and the Pedo-Baptists will be careful how they again bring one of their itinerant journeymen into our midst." "Your views, brethren, coincide with mine entirely. I am fully convinced that the Reverend lecturer must be met, or otherwise great harm will be done, and the cause of truth be made to suffer most fearfully in this community. His bold and unscrupulous manner of speaking, his con- stant reiteration of salient' points, his garbled readings from the Scriptures, and his unfounded statements with regard to the signification of Hebrew and Greek words, all tend to impress his hearers with the feeling that he must. have truth on his side; and as they will never take the trouble to calmly look at the question in all its bearings for themselves, it will devolve on some one to do so. for them. I have attended both of his lectures, taking pretty copious notes, and have been this morning elaborating my various points of refutation and collecting the testi- mony of Pedo-Baptist authors; and if the brethren deem it wise ,for me, in the course of a week or two, to present. the truth on these points as we hold it, I shall be prepared to do so. It is no new ground for me, though I need to burnish my weapons a little. Several years ago I met. with a minister of the Methodist persuasion, who presented     "4       Evangel Wiseman. to the community in which I then resided a somewhat similar line of argument on the same subject, and the brethren of- my church desired that I should meet him, which I did as best as I could; and there has never been a lecturer of any kind introduced since, nor did the Meth- odist Church in that town receive a member in two years after, although the pastor held in that time two series of meetings." "At what time, Doctor, do you think it best for you to begin? You are a better judge than ourselves. And in what place shall we meet?" "I think, Brother West, that il a week after Mr. Nailom closes, it will be the proper time for us. The people will then be rested, and yet the excitement will not have passed away. The community will still remember what he has said, and some of his expressions can be turned against himself with great force. I think our church is the most suitable place. It is as commodious as theirs, as centrally located, and many will attend these discourses who would not otherwise come into our congregation; but, once familiar with the place, they may become per- manent members of this .congregation; and in the course -of time, we may very safely hope, will be led to Jesus, and unite with us. In all our movement, we 'should be wise as serpents,' that truth may triumph and God be honored. Do these suggestions meet your approbation, brethren?" "Entirely, entirely!" "Well, then, it will be wise to let our intended course ;be known. It will serve to keep the Reverend lecturer somewhat on his guard, and will break much of the force of his discourses, for the people will feel all along that there is a contrary view of each point he argues, and their minds Will not so freely receive his daring statements."   Resolves--The Venture.       415 "Well, We will consider these premises settled, Doctor; and as you are engaged in the good work of preparing your refutation, we will bid you good-morning." And the four deacons left the pastor's study, pleased at the arrange- ment agreed upon, and impressed with the conviction that they had the right man in the right place. "Herbert Wiseman!"Miss Delia never addressed her nephew in this manner only when she felt very earnest and somewhat in power. "Herbert Wiseman," she said, as she sipped her morning coffee and leisurely buttered the smoking muffin, "I tell you just here, before Evangel and Lilly, that you must have Vernon baptized next Sun- day. If you do not wish it done in my church, if you are so opposed to us Episcopalians, why, you can take him to Dr. Peterson's church. There are to be several children baptized there on that day, and while I should greatly prefer to have Dr. Cheney, yet I will not object to Dr. Peterson or Mr. Nailom. Oh, have you heard the news? No, I suppose not. All the children of your Baptist sister, Mrs. Major Boswell, are to be baptized there, every one of them, from the eldest, eight years old, to the baby at the breast. You know," continued Miss Delia, all excited, "that Mrs. Boswell would never allow her chil- dren to be baptized before. The Major has always said it was just as much as he could do to keep himself out of the water, and it was no use for his friends to ask him why he did not have his children baptized." "And what has brought about this wondrous change, aunty?" "Oh, the Major is convinced of his duty, and he is determined to do it."     "6       Evangel -Wiseman. "And is SMrs. Boswell convinced too?" "Oh, no; I understood from Mrs. Harrison last night,-- you know we sat beside each other at the lecture,-that Mrs. Boswell is violently opposed to. the Major having it done, and will not consent; says she will make the last one of them Baptists." "And is the Major going to have it done when his wife is so violently opposed to it?"  - "Yes; Mrs. Harrison,-- you know she is an intimate friend of Mrs. Boswell,-told me that it whl certainly be done. The Major has fully decided on his course, and already Mr. Peterson has been informed of it. And now, Herbert, you must have Vernon baptized, too," added Miss Delia, after a slight pause. "You will never have a more favorable time in the world, and it would be a shame to let it pass." "But, aunty, of which church will Vernon be member when he is sprinkled? Will he be Baptist because his believing parents are members of that church, or will he be a Presb yterian because sprinkled by a Presbyterian minister? or will lie be an Episcopalian because his Epis- copal aunt had it done? It seems to me it will be a mixed matter decidedly." Evangel and Lilly both laughed outright at this facetious remark of Mr. Wiseman, which added to Miss Delia's confusion; but she soon rallied and replied: "Oh, it doesn't matter which church he belongs to, so that his soul is saved." "But who is to train him up in the way he has set out upon? Evangel and I can't do it, because we believe it wrong. Mr. Peterson and Mr. Nailom can't because they have children of their own; nor can you, because you believe in baptismal regeneration, which the Presbyterians ,   Resolves-- Te   Venture.    417 repudiate, and they believe in the covenant obligation, to whnich you Episcopalians do not hold at all. So I cannot see that he is to be placed in any better condition than he is now, with his parents to train him in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."  I "Herbert Wiseman, how can you stickle on such umnim portant matters, when the salvation of your child is at stake, and you are convinced it is your duty to act?" "How do you know, aunty, that I am convinced?" "I know that you must be. Nobody in this world could listen to that lecture last night without seeing that it is the imperative duty of every believing parent to have their children baptized. You see it, don't you, Evangel?" said Miss Delia, turning suddenly upon her niece. Mrs. Wiseman's face grew red at being thus accosted, and laughing, she said: "Mr. Nailom certainly did present the subject in a new and striking manner, aunty." "But are you not convinced, Evangel?" "Convinced of what, aunt$y?" "Why, convinced that it is your duty to have Vernon baptized."  "' Oh, you know that I have not heard the other -side, aunty. I mustn't make up my mind too hastily." "The other side, Evangel Wiseman!" replied Miss Delia emphatically. "The other side! how foolishly you talk. Don't you know there 'is no other side? Didn't God command it himself, and how can there be any other side? '  "I did not hear Mr. Nailom read any command of God to have children sprinkled." "But didn't he command Abraham to have his son circumcised, and all the male children in the house?" 27     -Evangel Wfrzseman. e  "But he said not a word about the females, aunty, and you sprinkle both sexes." "Oh, like Herbert, you want to quibble. You are both convinced of your duty. Why don't you discharge it?" "I do wish the darling child could be baptized next Sunday," interposed Lilly, pleasantly,  he is looking so sweet since he recovered. Brother, if you are con- vinced by Mr. Nailom, won't you do as we wish?" "Yes, Lilly; but while Mr. Nailom is very strong in the Presbyterian argument, I know, notwithstanding aunt Delia is so positive in her opinion, that there is another side which I must look at before I can decide this point." "Well, Herbert, I do hope you will make haste about it, for I don't intend that Sunday shall pass without witnessing Yernon's baptism. And I shall go to work to-day to prepare everything necessary. Sister said last night that there could never be a better opportunity than this, if you ever intend to have it done at all. And so did brother." "But they, like yourself, would greatly prefer that Dr. Cheney should do it, What do you say, Herbert, to inviting Mr. Nailom to tea to-morrow evening? Perhaps, if you could talk with him, you might have all your objec- tions removed. You know he takes a different line of argument from Dr. Cheney, and to me it is more clear and convincing." "I do not object at all to having Mr. Nailom to take tea with us, aunty, but I shall mostg seriously oppose any argument on the subject of infant baptism. I have his views of it in full from night to night. As to its being clearer and more convincing than Dr. Cheney, perhaps if you heard the other side,--for I assure you there is   'another side,'-you might see that much he has said is merely fallacious." " Why, didn't he read the Bible to prove what he said? Didn't he expressly show that this covenant was to Abra- ham and his seed for a thousand generations, and that it included the children?  How very conclusive, Herbert, are those words in the Psalm he read, and how clearly he explained them! " "That is his strongest point, aunty, one that I have not examined." "I thought he made it very convincing," interposed Evangel, for the first time advancing an opinion, "I do not know how that can be met." "Well, let's look at it now for a moment. I have an hour before going down town. Lilly, please bring us the Bible. Does any one remember the psalm?" "I do. It was the hundredth and fifth," replied Lilly, as she left the room and ran to the parlor for the Bible. Mr. Wiseman having received it from her, pushed his plate aside, and opening the book before him, began to read at the sixth verse, and went through with the lengthy quotation of Rev. Mr. Nailom. "Yes, yes, that is it, I remember it well," interposed Miss Delia in a soft, approving tone.  "Strong, very strong," she nodded to Evangel, and then bowed across the table to Lilly, repeating, "strong, very strong." "Now, aunty, what do you think this covenant was that God thus gave to Abraham, and confirmed unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant?" '"Why, a covenant that promised to them and their children all spiritual blessings, so that the children were made partakers with their parents of all the promised good, and if the parents are believers the children are      420       Evangel Wiseman. entitled to all the fruits that flow from this connection, and although they cannot believe, yet because their parents do they should be baptized." "You think it was what you would call a church, or spiritual covenant?" "Certainly it was." "You remember the Rev. Mr. Nailom did not read it. Did he?" "No; but he told us what it was." "Well, if he told you it was a spiritual covenant, he said what ' David did not authorize him to state.' Now, listen while I read, aunty, and perhaps you may decide that there are two sides to the question after all. Here are the words of David in the very next verse after the last one read by Mr. Nailom:  'Saying,' -now listen, for I am going to read the covenant,-'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.' You see, aunty, it is certainly a carnal blessing, rela- ting to the posterity of Abraham. How a man who pro- fesses to be an embassador for Christ, can dare to give out such wrong impressions from the pulpit, it is difficult to conceive. And yet Mr. Nailom has done this thing, as all who heard him can attest. I observed that he did not read the covenant, the blessings of which he so fully por- trayed, but I took it for granted that it was of a spiritual character, and am only too surprised that it only pertains. entirely and unequivocally to an earthly possession." "Herbert, have you read that aright?'" asked Miss  Vernon starting from her seat with surprise. "Surely you have made a mistake in the psalm. It is not possible that Mr. Nailom did such a thing"  Mrs. Wiseman's look of wonder was amusing to behold. She knew her husband had made no blunder in reading the   Resolves-The Venture.       421 psalm, for the lecturer had reiterated in every possible manner, the argument deduced from the covenant which God had ratified to Isaac with an oath, having first made it to Abraham while he journeyed from Haran to Bethel. Lilly's face was suffused with blushes at the thought of a minister being guilty of such deception. Mr. Wise- man felt greatly relieved. He had supposed the blessing promised was wholly of a spiritual nature, and the manner in which the lecturer had presented it, so full of confidence and emphasis, and the deductions he had so artfully made, had quite puzzled him, and left him to feel that this new view of the subject was stronger than he had ever before encountered. And under this impression he had purchased such books as he thought would present the whole subject fairly, determined to find the truth, let it lead him to what course of action it might. How gratefully surprised was he, to find that the covenant made to Abraham and confirmed to Isaac by an oath, and to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, was simply to I give them an earthly possession How easily was the Gordian knot severed--how readily the lecturer's whole superstructure dashed in atoms to the groundl Mr. Wiseman made no further remark, but bidding the ladies good-morning, he took his hat and called for a short time at his office, where he met Mr. Everett, who had come to consult him with regard to the best course the Baptists . should pursue. After a close conversation, in which all  points were freely discussed, and the conclusion reached that, at a proper time, Mr. Nailom should be answered, Mr. Wiseman proceeded to the study of his pastor, to ask his opinion as to the best manner to adopt. He found Dr. Eaton busily engaged in his work of preparation, and in a few brief words explained to him the object of his early call.     Evangel Wiseman. *  The Doctor gave him the conclusion to which the deacons had come, with which Mr. Wiseman was greatly pleased, for he felt sure that his pastor could demolish all the strongholds in which error had entrenched herse!f. "How recklessly, Doctor, he deals with the covenant! What an imposition he practices on the people when he teaches them to believe that it was of a spiritual nature, and included children, and therefore children of believing parents are entitled to church immunities, and therefore it becomes the imperative duty of Christian fathers to have their offspring sprinkled! I was myself quite staggered by his lectures, and did not see how his assertions and arguments were to be met, until, on turning to the 105th Psalm this morning and reading it, I found the promise was to give to Abraham and his seed the land of Canaan for an inheritance. I was .overwhelmed with surprise to find that the Reverend gentleman had greatly misrep- resented the whole thing. Of course all his conclusions based on' such false premises are necessarily false. I had never before heard this line of argument, and the manner in which he presented it, together with his bold assertions, made a deep impression on my mind. It must have done so on all his audience, and unless it is answered, great detriment must follow to the cause of truth." "I think so, Brother Wiseman. So few persons will take the time to search out the truth for themselves! This the lecturer knows, and therefore he strove to make the false impression as deep and lasting as possible. Did you not observe with what emphasis he re-asserted, over and over again, the points he desired to fix in the minds of the 'people? I have never known any man to be so entirely unscrupulous.  I wonder if he thought such glaring misrepresentations would pass unnoticed?"   "He must have believed so, otherwise he would not have made them. They have had their effect, I know. My aunt told us at the breakfast-table that Major Boswell will have all his children sprinkled next Sunday morning." "On what ground, Brother Wiseman?" "He is convinced, I understand, that it is his duty as a Christian parent, and he has informed his pastor, Mr. Peterson, of his intention." "What will sister Boswell say to such a step? You know her intelligent opposition has thus far overcome the Major's early teachings. It has often been a question in the family since the birth of the first daughter, who is now, I believe, eight years of age; the Major urging that it should be done, on the ground that if it did no. good it could not possibly do harm; and she insisting that it could do no good, and would do the children incal- culable harm, inasmuch as it would lead them to believe they had received some blessing in the act, and had had some privilege conferred, both of which notions are false. Hitherto she has always proved victor in the argument, and I must acknowledge my surprise that she has at last yielded." "I do not think she has at all consented, Doctor; but the Major is determined to override her views and desires, and have the children sprinkled anyhow." "Ahl that is the state of the case, is it? I suppose like a prudent woman she concludes that as she has.no power, save that of argument, and this no longer having force, she must succumb and allow wrong to prevail." "I judge this is the true state of affairs. I know quite a number of infants are to be presented for sprinkling, and my aunt declares that our little fellow shall be baptized on the occasion."      424       Evangel Wiseman. "What does your wife think of the Reverend gentle- man's lecture? Is she, like others, convinced of the duty of believing parents to baptize their unconscious babes?" I have not spoken to her on the subject, but I am sure, from some casual remark she has made, that she too was deeply impressed by Mr. Nailom's assertions. But when I read to her his quotations from the Psalms this morning, and then the covenant which his quotation ratified, she like myself was amazed. I presume she is again quieted. She has had such a terrible struggle to overcome her early teachings! And I find every new argument in favor of infant sprinkling arouses her old prejudices, and it some- times seems to me she will never emerge into the full light of truth." "Early impressions are indeed abiding. On this prin- ciple Catholicism has built its present gigantic structure." It is so And how unwise Protestants are, to subject the impressive minds of their children to their guidance! You have heard that Miss De Lany joined their organiza- tion last Sunday. You know her parents are prominent members of Dr. Peterson's church, but they sent her to Canada to a Catholic, school, where she imbibed their doctrines; and now, despite the entreaties of her father and mother, and the earnest endeavors of her pastor, she has defied all, and has gone into the Catholic communion." "And the next thing she does will be to defy her parents, and either become a nun, or marry some one to whom they are violently opposed." "Yes, her best friends are predicting a sad fate for her, based on her self-will and obstinacy. But I will not detain you from your pen longer, Doctor. I am gratified with the proposed course, and trust it may do good. I hope my wife's mind will forever be at rest, and that many may   Resolves-The Venture.       425 be convinced of their error. Good-morning." And Mr. Wiseman warmly shook his kind pastor's hand, for he not only loved him dearly, but very highly respected his talent. "Well, wife, have you got the children ready for their baptism next Sunday?" said Major Boswell, pleasantly, to Mrs. B. as he came in to dinner. "Ready, Major? what ready do you mean? I thought they were born ready." "Oh, you understand me. I mean, are the clothes prepared? You know that they ought to present a genteel appearance on the occasion. The church will be crowded with the most elegant people of Chester, and you would be mortified if they did not look well." "They have decent clothing, Major, such as they wear to church. I suppose that will answer. If it does not, you must look out for better yourself, for I assure you conscientiously that I shall take no part in this arrange- ment at all, and shl'l feel no mortification at the children's appearance on the occasion, for I shall not be present to witness it." "Why, Annie, what do you mean? You are not going to absent yourself when our children are baptized? Think of little Fred there without you!" "1 shall not be instrumental in the slightest degree in having him there, Major; and as he and the others will be present at 'the altar for baptism' 'in direct opposition to my well-known and oft-expressed views, I leave all responsibility on you, who are so determined to have it so." "And won't you go, Annie dear?" said the Major coax- ingly to his wife.     426       Evangel Wiseman. ' No, Major, I shall conscientiously stay at home. This is the only redress I have. Yes, there is another. I will raise the last one of them Baptists; shall teach them from the word of God the wrong of the course that has been pursued toward them, and I'll guarantee that each one of them shall go under water when they unite with the church for themselves." "Well, Annie, I must do my duty." "Major, who hath required this at your hands? Surely Christ has not; and who beside has authority?" "Oh, our church teaches it, Annie, and I have made up my mind it is my duty, and it is not worth while for us to argue the subject farther." "Certainly, Major, the couplet is applicable to you in this case. You are convinced that the Bible does not enjoin it upon you--that is only to obey the customs of the church that you do it. You know, too, that you are trespassing on my conscientious views, and yet you dare all and do it, because you have made up your mind." "Well, I'll just tell you what it is," said Billy Dodge, as he sat in the door with his hat on one side of his head and tapped his foot on the step beneath him, while he made believe he was going to shoot his little sister on the pavement with the big glass marble between the knuckles of his thumb and his first finger, "I'll just tell you what it is, I don't believe a word in baptizing babies, if Mr. Nailom does say it's right." ' Hush, Billy, my son," chided his mother, "you don't know what you are talking about." "But mudder," - Billy always had this peculiar pronun- ciation for mother, "I read the Bible at Sunday school,   Resolves-The Venture.       427 and I have never found a single word about baptizing babies. And I heard Mr. Everett say, when I was round at Mr. Wiseman's office this morning, that the 'covenant argument' that Mr. Nailom talks so much about, was a covenant that God made with good old Abraham to give. him land. And when I came home I looked at the very Psalm, for I remembered what Mr. Naiilom said, and sure enough it was just as Mr. Everett and 2Mr. Wiseman told each other. It was a promise to give him the land of Ca- naan, and there is not a speck of mention about anything else." "Billy, my son, what are you talking about?" asked Elder Dodge, looking up from his evening paper. "What do you know about such .matters?" asked the father, having listened to Billy's emphatic assertion. "I know, papa, what the Bible says, and it don't say a word about baptizing babies in the old Bible or in the new Bible. I have read all the places that all the people have told me to,but I have never read where any baby was baptized." "Tut, tut, Billy, you are too young to be setting up your opinions against older persons." And Elder Dodge resumed his reading, not realizing that Billy could think, if he couldn't express his opinion. And Billy did think, and think that he was right, and those who baptized babies were wrong, because he couldn't. find it in the Bible. The Presbyterian Church was filled each night to over- flowinog with anxious and well pleased listeners.  The lecturer felt flattered at such large and respectable audi- ences, and, emboldened by their presence, he launched out into all the fallacies' of the prepared discourses, spending     428       Evangel Wiseman. a portion of his time each evening in abusing and deriding "the dippers," as he denominated the Baptists, who he rashly asserted were only two or three hundred years old as an organization, and who were ignorant and narrow- minded, -and quite indecent in their mode of baptism. * Mr. Wiseman, Evangel and aunt Delia attended every lecture, notwithstanding Mr. Wiseman's legal engage- ments were very pressing throughout each day. Miss Delia's hopes ran high. She was assured that if the covenant argument had been upset, Herbert must be overcome by Mr. Nailom's powerful nightly logic, and she knew that he once convinced, Evangel would yield without a word to his superior judgment, and the dear babe would be baptized at last and saved. So she gave out to her friends the great probability was, that Vernon Wiseman would be baptized on the following Sabbath in the Presbyterian church, which news spread from house to house, until every acquaintance of the family heard it. The three ladies, Mrs. Wiseman, Miss Delia and Lilly Vernon, were going shopping on Saturday morning to be out for several hours. Leaving Vernon in the care of Bridget Mahoney, who, to use her own expressive lan- guage, "was jist as tinder of the dear little one as if it was her own blessed darlint," the three proceeded at an early hour down street. Bridget's mind had long been full of a great project. Ever since she had stood beside the door on that dreadful night of suspense, when she was compelled to see her cherished desires disappointed by the untimely interference * Mr. Nailom had been a Reformed preacher, and at one time, had as strongly argued for immersion as he was now doing for infant sprinkling. Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.   Resolves-The Venture.       429 of Mr. Wiseman in Miss Delia's almost consummated plan for Vernon's baptism, she had felt it her duty to see that the child was baptized. She determined she would have it done the first opportunity that presented itself. Bridget had no scruples at all about taking the child of another, clandestinely to the priest to have it sprinkled. For, was it not for the salvation of its soul? Was it not to prevent. its going down to the regions of darkness, and gain for it admittance into the heavenly world? The end justified the means with Bridget, and she only waited on from day to day until a fitting occasion should offer itself. Father O'Reilly lived not a great way from Mr. Wise- man's,. and as Bridget could reach his house without passing through the populous part of the city, she felt if she only had the time she could effect her purpose com- pletely, without the least fear of detection. Now the time had come. Mrs. Wiseman would be absent until the noon. It was Saturday, and no one would be calling, and even if they should, what would they know of the cause of her absence? So as the babe lay on her lap, so bright and beautiful, and Bridget thought of the time when it was so near death and the dark world, and felt that its heartless parents would not provide for the salvation of its dear little soul, and that it might soon again be taken sick and perhaps die, her pious soul was stirred within her, and she was moved to high daring. "It's a grate risk be shure, I'se be takin' on meself," said Bridget Mahoney, as she thought on the possibility of being discovered, "but it's for the good of the dear, swate sowl of the darlint, and in faith I must do it, risk or no risk. Holy Virgin I bless me!" said Bridget, turn- ing her eyes reverently up to the ceiling. "It may by faith bring me into a mity throuble. I may lose my place, and     4ou       fivange& w zseman. git to meself a mity bad name. An' I may, by faith. But it's my bounden duty and I must do it. These heretics are mity good people, but poor sowls they don't know a thing about the church, no morn 'n the very heaythen themselves. They don't know at all, nor at all, what is needed for this darlint's sowl. So, darlint, it is for your own swate good then, Bridget Mahoney is agoin' to take you to the praste this very blessed mornin' and let him baptize you, you swate one! They'll not be back afore the' dinner," said Bridget, half aloud, and I will have a plenty of time to run over an' git back long afore they does come. An' nobody on airth need to know anything about it but the praste an' meself." So Bridget having got all the matter arranged in her brain, laid Vernon on the floor, stepped to her room, put on a clean dress, and her new summer hat, and giving him as much of the pap as he could eat, went in search of the new cap and robe. She had a pretty good idea where they were, for she had on one occasion stepped into the room Miss Delia occupied, when that lady was exam- Ining them to see they were in proper condition for use. She found them without trouble. The robe was in a box in the wardrobe, the cap in another. She could not take the two boxes and the babe. She did not dare to put them on, before reaching the priest's lhouse, lest some mark should indicate that they had been used, and thus she would be detected. So, after devising many plans all of which she had to reject, she decided to run the risk of fitting the robe into the box with the cap. Arrangements consummated to Bridget's satisfaction, she carefully closed the front blinds, locked the hall door, fastened her kitchen, and, passing quickly out of the alley gate, set out in great haste for Father O'Reilly's.   Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     431 CHAETER XXVIII. SUCCESS OF BRIDGET MAHONEY^S EXPEDITION. HE three ladies walked along that beautiful morning, gaily chatting as they passed square after square, never for a moment dreaming of the important lrle Bridget had gotten up on her own responsibility. They were just turning into Fourth street, where the shops were, when they were encountered by Mrs. Knowlton and her sister-Mrs. Lyman-and Kittie Knowlton, old and dear friends of Evangel and her father's family, who had come in from the country on the early train, and were pro-- ceeding to Mr. Wiseman's, to spend the day and night, in order to be at the meeting at the Presbyterian church, as they were members of that body, and desired to be present on the interesting occasion of the baptism of so many children. Mr. Knowlton had been in the previous day, and had learned from his friend, Major Boswell, of the great interest aroused by the lectures of the Rev. Mr. Nailom, and the success he had in convincing parents of their duty towards their children. The ladies had become so enlisted in the cause, that, notwithstanding the many hindrances Mrs. Knowlton had to overcome, she had resolutely pressed on to the attainment of her desires, and leaving Mr. Knowlton in charge of the children and the household arrangements generally, had come in to the city to remain until Monday. Mrs. Knowlton and Mrs. Lyman urged the ladies should pursue their shopping and allow them to proceed to "Our Home," where they could rest and entertain themselves until they should return.     432       Evangel Wiseman. Mrs. Wiseman, of course, could not consent to treat her  guests with so little consideration; and, as the most im- portant purchases were for Lilly, it was at length decided that she, accompanied by Kittie Knowlton, should attend to the business of the morning, leaving Miss Delia and Evangel to return with the ladies. "How  very careful Bridget is!  Really, she is a treasure!" remarked Miss Delia in a most commendatory tone, as, passing up from the street-gate, she discovered the whole front of the house-which had been left open for a morning airing--was now entirely closed. "She is so thoughtful about everything." "Truly, a priceless treasure," feelingly added Mrs. Knowlton, whose experience with servants for the past year had caused her to write her indorsement of the whole of them "Vanity and vexation of spirit." Mrs. Wiseman preceding the ladies, ran up stairs, and seizing the knob, made an effort to open the door for their reception. Failing in this, she rang the bell quickly, waited a moment-rang again, waited, no response; then a third ring, more determined than the two that had preceded. Still no one came. What does this mean? Surely Bridget has not gone out and left Vernon alone!" A look of astonishment and anxiety rested on her face. "Oh, no, no, Evangel! you may rest assured of that. I suspect she is asleep. You know she sat up quite late last night with that sick child across the street. You had better run around and pass through the back way and open the door.' Mrs. Wiseman stepped quickly to the rear gate, passed in-no sign of life. Surely Bridget must be sleeping. Everything was closed as in front. She tried the kitchen   Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     433 door-it opened. She entered. Passing with hurried step through the dining room and hall, she admitted the ladies, and inviting them to seats in the parlor, ran up stairs to look for Bridget and the baby. Miss Delia remained to assist the ladies in the removal of their hats, and refresh them with water until Evangel could receive them up stairs. Judge of Evangel's consternation when she reached her own room and found it vacantI She hurriedly visited every apartment in the house, her fear and perplexity increasing at every new disappointment. Then, as the last hope, she sought Bridget's room. It was as silent as the qthers. Her mind was so confused she could not think. Bridget had never before betrayed her trust. .What could such conduct mean? She paused to control herself before descending to the parlor, but her heart beat fast, as a thousand fearful suggestions rushed through her mind. "You found her asleep, Evangel?" said Miss Delia as Mrs. Wiseman entered the room, with hat on and parasol still in hand. "How silly in you to be so alarmed I Young mothers are so foolish about their babies!" "No, aunty. I have looked everywhere, and can find neither Vernon nor Bridget!" replied Evangel, making a mighty effort at self-control, and forcing asmile. ' I don't know what to think of it!" 'Oh, they have gone out for a walk, Mrs. Wiseman," soothingly interposed Mrs. Knowlton, whose experience with her seven had made her quite well versed in the liber- ties of nurses, and also meekly submissive to the ups and downs of the nursery.  "I should not feel the least anxiety; it is a beautiful morning, and the air will do him vast good." "But the girl has never taken such license before. She has been unusually careful. And had she contemplated 26     434       Evangel Wiseman. such a thing, she would doubtless have spoken to us about it before we left."- "Oh, it was an after-thought, Mrs. Wiseman," suggested Mrs. Lyman, who, having lost all her three children when young, knew so well how to enter into the mother's feelings. "She grew tired of the quiet house, and perhaps the baby became restless." "If it were her habit I should not be at all anxious, But she has never done anything to lead me to suppose she would' take this step on her own responsibility. And, besides, I enjoined her to keep him in my room, as he has not been altogether well for a few days past." Miss Delia passed to her room to lay aside her bonnet and gloves. Reaching the bed, she discovered the box that held Vernon's baptismal robe, upon it. " What is this? I did not leave this box here, I am sure!" she said to herself. She lifted the lid. It was empty. Like the lightning'flash the truth came to her. She hastened to the wardrobe, looked in. The cap box was gonel   Yes, it was so. 'Bridget Mahoney had taken - Vernon to the priest to be baptized. How could she tell Evangel? Could the thing be prevented? If baptized by the priest he could not be publicly baptized, and all her long-cherished hopes and desires would be swept away forever. - What could be done? What must she do? She was chagrined, bewil- dered. Evangel must know it, and that speedily, so that if it could be prevented at all, they might proceed quickly to do so.  She called to Evangel. Her voice was full of agitation and alarm. "Can he be dead?" the mother asked herself, as, almost ready to faint, she hastened up the stairway.   Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     435 "Here, Evangel, look at this empty boxl The robe is gone and the cap is gone, and Bridget has taken Vernon to the priest to be baptized!" "Oh, aunty, aunty  can this be?"And the mother, overcome by her emotion, sank on the sofa beside her. "What must we do? What will Herbert say? Oh, it is dreadful, dreadfull I could not think Bridget would have done this. But can't she be prevented? Is it too late? She can't have been long gone. Where does the priest live? I will run myself to his house. Maybe I shall be in time. Would Bridget do this!" "It is a part of their faith, Evangel. She does it for the child's eternal good." "But where does the priest live-who is he? Tell me- tell me, that I may go before my child is baptizedl" Miss Delia in her alarm had forgotten to remove her bonnet. "No, no, Evangel; let me go. I  know where Father O'Reilly lives-next door to that Catholic church in St. Augustine street."- "And you will run there and prevent it if possible, aunty? Do go quickly and bring the child here. But he may not be there! She may have-taken him elsewhere!, "No, I think not. This is the nearest place, and Father O'Reilly is her priest. If the deed is not done when I get there, I will assuredly put a stop to all proceedings, for I wish Vernon publicly baptized, not- done in a corner, nor by a  Catholic priest." Miss Vernon set out on her errand, walking as fast as it was possible for her to do, while Mrs. Wiseman returned to the parlor to explain to her friends the circumstances and her apprehensions. It was a  novel and distressing case. The Presbyterian     436       Evangel Wiseman. ladies had as great a horror of a baptism administered by a Catholic priest as Evangel had herself. Miss Delia almost ran. Square after square was rapidly trod, until she stood fronting the door of priest O'Reilly's little red brick- house. She rang the bell; an Irish woman answered. , Is the priest in?" i"Yes, marm." "Can I see him?T Walk in, marm, and I'll spake to him." Miss Delia stepped into the little parlor, full of pictures of saints and crucifixion scenes. She felt queer, but it was an important matter, one that did not admit of delay nor useless etiquette.    * In a few moments the priest entered in his long black gown and stole. Evidently he had been officially engaged. Great was his surprise to see before him one whom he knew in a moment was not a Catholic; and bowing very low, he was preparing to be exceedingly complaisant to the stranger, when he was taken all aback by Miss Delia's-j curt question: "Do you know Bridget Mahoney, Father O'Reilly! She is a member of your church." '4 Oh, well-very well!" answered the priest still stand- ing.  "Has she been here this morning to have a baby       1 baptized?" "No," replied the priest, hesitatingly. "There has been a one baby here, but the mother brought it. Bridget has    X no baby, has she? -                     t "Oh, no but she has taken dur baby out to be bap- tized. Are you sure she has not been in? What kind of   tA a baby was it?"   Bidget Mahoney's Expedition.     437        ; "It was a fair child about three months old." "Is the woman with the child here yet?" "No; she has been gone about ten minutes." "And you are sure it was not Bridget who brought it?" "I know it was not, for she once lived in my house and I know her well." Miss Delia rose and bade the priest good-morning. "She has gotten some one else to bring him. It is Vernon, I know it. But it is all over. Too late, too late!  And I must go home and tell Evangel the sad truth. Of course Bridget Mahoney will deny it. But it is so-it is so. I do hope she has taken the child home, so that Evangel's dreadful anxiety will be relieved."            Miss Delia walked homeward as fast as she could, talking in a low tone to herself most of the way. She was satisfied the deed had been done-that Vernon had been baptized. Either the priest had falsified about Bridget, or she had been wise enough to shield herself by getting another to ake the child to the priest. "What will Herbert say? What can Bridget say for erself?  What will Evangel do? Will she now present Ternon to be baptized publicly?"  Miss Delia reached home  exhausted. Bridget had not eturned with the child. She told her story. There was ut one conclusion from it-the baby had undoubtedly  een sprinkled. "What will Herbert say? what will he do?  He   has ways been so opposed to having Vernon baptized; and )w to have it done by a   Catholic priest will be more all he can bear." "  But, -Evangel, if it is all done, we shall have to submit it; there is no undoing the matter now." "But, aunty, it is too bad I too bad  I do wish Herbert     438       Evangel Wiseman. were here! Bridget ought to be home by this time! Oh,  that I had some one to send for Herbert, that he might go out and look for my baby!" The poor mother was almost franctic. Miss Delia, quite exhausted, was reclining on the sofa, almost as much agitated as Evangel. "Let me go, Evangel, to your husband's office," kindly offered Mrs. Knowlton. "Give me the street and number, and I know I can find it, and quickly bring him out." Mrs. Wiseman thankfully accepted the offer of her friend, who, donning her hat, proceeded with rapid pace in search of Mr. Wiseman. Evangel followed her to the gate, looked eagerly up and down the street, returned a few paces; sought the gate again, and strained her vision to see if her darling were coming. Mrs. Knowlton found Mr. Wiseman in his office with several friends. Calling him aside, she told him the terrible story, as quietly and in as few words as possible. Mr. Wiseman excused himself without explanation, and has- tened home with Mrs. Knowlton, who endeavored in a kind manner to relieve his mind of its dreadful appre- hension. Mr. Wiseman reached home. Bridget had not yet come. The case was presented to him by Miss Delia, in her most graphic manner. ' And did the priest positively affirm that Bridget had not been there to-day." "He did, Herbert. I asked him the question twice. He knows her well, for she was at one time a servant in his house, and he declared she had not been in this morning." ' "But he had sprinkled a baby?" "Yes."   Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     439 "What description did he give of it?" "He said it was a fair child, about three montht old; and was brought to him by its mother." "Did you ask him how the baby was dressed, aunty? Bridget, I believe, took the robe and cap." "No, Herbert; I did not; for I just felt as if he was telling a falsehood all the time; for he saw that we did not want the baby baptized. And so I got away as soon as possible." "She has had time to return with him." "Oh, yes; she had left the priest's about ten minutes before I got there; so you see she ought to have been home long ago." Mr. Wiseman sat in silence for a few minutes, as if to decide what he could best do. He was in a state of feverish anxiety himself; he saw that his wife was almost overcome. But what to do that would prove effectual? Bridget would certainly deny the sprinkling of the infant. No threat nor persuasion would induce her to acknowledge it. So that, for the truth in the case, he must rely on circumstantial evidence. He knew she would bring the child home in time to escape detection. He only wondered that she had not yet come. He went to the gate and looked out; but nothing could be seen of her. "I will go to see the priest myself, and if anything can be elicited that will aid us to ascertain the truth, I shall do it. If Bridget should come while I am gone, do not ask her any questions at all; leave it to me." "But if she should not come, Herbert, what must we do? I am so anxious about my child l" "You need give yourself no uneasiness about Vernon's safety, my dear," he answered tenderly, endeavoring to soothe the almost frenzied condition of Evangel's mind,     "O       Evangel Wiseman. who had allowed the most dreadful apprehensions to take complete control of her judgment. The priest, O'Reilly, was astonished and put quite on his guard, by the presence of a second stranger in his parlor, on the same errand-to ascertain if a baby had been baptized. After bidding Mr. Wiseman a very affable good morning, and learning the object of his visit, he drew his chair near him, scrutinized him closely, and fortified him- self on every vulnerable point. The priest had had much to do with his fellow men. He was suspicious, calculating, and determined. "Will you give me a description of the baby and of the woman?" asked Mr. Wiseman, after the affirmative answer of the priest to the question-- if a baby had been brought in that morning to be sprinkled. "It was a goodly child; I should judge about three months old." "Then it must have been the child of Protestant parents, for Catholics never wait so long before administering the rite."  "I think it was. The mother, or she who claimed to     1 be the mother of the child, was not a Catholic." "Was it a boy or girl?" "A boy." "What name did she give you?" "Oh, I do not now recall; but wait a moment, I will    s look at my register." And the priest stepped to the back room. Returning, he replied, "Norman Glossop."       li "And this is the last name on your register?"       n "It is.' Will you permit me to see it?"              E The priest stepped to his room again, and after a short  th time returned with a small black book in his hands.     he iv     Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     441 He showed it to Mr. Wiseman. There, to be sure, was the name, Norman Glossop, last on the page, but the ink was not dry with which it was written, a very suspicious circumstance, and one that led to serious doubts in Mr. Wisemans mind. "Can you describe the child, its personal appearance, and dress?" "It was a pretty boy, and had on very good clothes." "Nothing remarkable that you observed?" ' Nothing that I could call attention to." "At what hour did this occur?" "About half past eight o'clock." "Then it is about an hour since?" Yes, about that time." "Did the woman appear to treat the child as if she rere the mother?" "I could not answer this question satisfactorily-to you. thought at the -time that there were some doubts about his, because of the disparity in the appearance of the- wo; but in this I might have been mistaken," replied ie priest, gravely. "Did the woman remain long after the ceremony?" "She left immediately." "You did not observe which way she went?" "I did, for I followed her to the door, and saw that e went westward toward Talmadge street." Having no more questions to ask that would throw Yht upon the subject, Mr. Wiseman bade the priest good )rning and left. He was convinced that Vernon had been sprinkled. erything tallied but the nurse and the name. But- mn the latter was evidently penned after he came in the use; and Bridget, to escape detection in the event that     "2       Evangel Wiseman. inquiries should be made, had employed some of her acquaintances to take the child to the priest. The conclu- sion was irresistible, and with this conviction in his mind he returned homeward, hoping to find the nurse and the child, and to bring Bridget to a confession if she had really been guilty of the alleged deed. He reached home, but Bridget had not done so. - Nothing remained but to await her coming. So the parents and friends made themselves as quiet as they could, and Mr. Wiseman posted himself at the front door to receive Bridget and the baby. In the course of half an hour Bridget returned, but coming in the back way she escaped observation until she made her debut in the parlor with Vernon in her arms. Great was her surprise when she found the ladies had returned before her. She slipped up stairs on tip-toe, and- hasten- ing to Miss Delia's room, replaced robe and cap and boxes, and then pausing for some minutes to be sure she had her story well learned, with as much composure as she could assume, and lots- more blarney than usual, she bore the baby to, its mother., Mrs.: Wiseman received her child as from the dead. She kissed it; she pressed it to her bosom; she caressed it again and again. Bridget commenced apologetically to say, " that the blessed mornin' was indade so bootiful,"  that she had " be share taken the little man a walkin'," But her pleasantry was quickly subdued when Mr. Wise- man stepped into the room in a manner that, showed he had been some time at home. "Ochl" she said to herself, " an' be shure it's all over wid meself now. The ladies have found me out and sent for him, and now what am I to do?"And as quickly as possible Bridget fled to the kitchen, whither Mr. Wiseman followed her.   Bridget Mahoney's Expedition.     44S "We were all greatly alarmed about you and the child,. Bridget," he said pleasantly, that he might not betray his. intention. "The ladies sent for me, fearing, I do believe, that you had run away with him." "Oh, indade, no, Mr. Wisemanl I only took the dear little man a bit of an airin' g" "But you were out a long while, Bridget." "Yes, an' be shure an' I was indade. For I met Miss; Vernon, and she made me go with her to the minister's house-her minister-Dr. Cheney-and then to Miss De. Long's. And we staid a swate while at both them places, and at last I told Miss Vernon I must get home, be shure, and I must indade, for Miss Evangel would be back an' wouldn't know  what had become of me   an' the little darlint." "And did you go nowhere else, Bridget?" "Indade an' I didn't, sir.

If it was true, as Bridget said, that she had encountered her and Vernon only three squares from home, and the two had been with her ever since, then the baby could not have been baptized. But he feared that in this the servant girl had told an untruth.      "4       Evangel Wiseman. What rendering she would give of her course in taking- the robe and cap away with the child, he could not suppose. He- would hear Mrs. Vernon's explanation; compare the' priest's story and Bridget's tale with it, and see if there were any weak points. All was surprise on the part of parents and friends. ' Miss Delia made. a thorough inspection of the robe and cap, but she could find no traces of their having been worn, only the strings of the cap had been tied, but this, might have been done when Lilly had tried it on. There were no pin marks in the robe, nor appearance-of water upon it. Thus far Bridget remained unconvicted. "Och, an' ain't I distrest that the darlint was not bap- tized An be shure after all me trouble to think he missed it at last, and complately I They'll find out be shure that I had intended to do it, be shure, meself, an' I shall lose my place any how.

So Bridget crossed herself, and, seizing the chickens, wrung off their necks and dipped them into the pot of hot water to pick. Surely Bridget had never worked so well. The chickens were soon prepared for the stew, ,aind in the course of two hours dinner was ready for thi table. Mrs. Vernon had not come. All was suspense.   Mrs. Vernon's Recital.      445 CHAPTER XXIX. MRS. VERNON'S RECITAL. SUNDAY'S BAPTISMS. 7TFHE hands of the clock pointed to one. Dinner was waiting to be dished.  Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman, whose suspense with regard to Bridget's move- ments had increased with every passing moment, had become painfully anxious for Mrs. Vernon's arrival. "She must have made this story, Herbert," said Evangel to her husband, as she stood beside him in his library, whither he had gone for rest. "I fear this is so, darling," he replied, as soothingly as he could. "And Vernon has been baptized by a priest!" "It would seem so. The only refutation of this supposi- tion is the appearance of the cap and robe. Aunt Delia tells me they do not seem to have been worn." "I will go  and look at them myself, perhaps aunty did not inspect closely." Mrs. Wiseman examined them minutely. She was con- vinced that the robe had not been put on the child; of *the cap she was not so sure. Returning to her husband, she said, "I am assured the robe has not been used, but then you  know, Herbert, Bridget might have been hurried and omittted to dress him up. The cap strings have certainly been tied, but then this might have been done when Lilly tried it on. Oh, that mother would come  and let us know the truth! If she does not, Herbert, you will go over to father's as soon as dinner is over and see about this thing. I cannot bear to feel this fearful anxiety."     "6       Evangel Wiseman. "I will, darling," he replied, as he drew her down and :kissed her, "Let us hope for the best. Circumstances are quite against Bridget. She evidently set out with the intention of taking our baby to the priest to be sprinkled, and this was done, unless it be as she has said, that meeting with Mrs. Vernon turned her aside from her -plans. Tell me, Evangel, are you opposed to having Vernon sprinkled, or do you wish it done? You have never spoken your mind freely on this subject to me, but I have sometimes thought that your early education and' :prejudices in favor of the rite, pleaded that our boy should be sprinkled." The wife paused for a moment, scarcely knowing what ito reply, then answered: "My mind has been racked with fearful doubts and fears on this subject, Herbert, ever since our baby died. Some- -times I have thought and felt one way, and then again I have been of a contrary mind entirely. Somzetimes the  subject has been clear-then again enveloped in utter darkness. Sometimes I have been at peace, at others over- -whelmed with anguish." 6'But how do you feel now, dearest? Do you think our babe is not saved, because it was not sprinkled?" "No, Herbert, I am fully convinced there is no regen- e eration in baptism. This belief has been entirely overcome. But I do feel--that is I think, it may be our duty to ,dedicate our child to the blessed Saviour in baptism." "And why our duty, Evangel??' "Because we are believing- parents, and do owe some- ithing of a spiritual character to our children." "Yes, and what that is, is expressly set forth in God's -word by Paul, in his letter to the church at Ephesus, where, -in giving guidance to the Christians in the various relations   frrs. Vernon's Recital.      447 of life, he sets forth this duty of which you speak, in these words: 'And ye fathers, provoke not your children to -wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.' "And do you think this is all, Herbert?" "I do, Evangel, for it covers the whole ground of a parent's responsibility. Could any act of mine change the heart of the child, that act would have been clearly taught. God would not have left it to inference; but the Saviour would have set it forth as clearly as He did faith and baptism for believers when he gave the commission to the apostles." 'I am   convinced, Herbert, that there is ho command in the New Testament for baptizing infants, nor is there a  clear example-only those that are suppositiious; and yet I cannot understand how it was this rite crept into existence." "Just like many other things, Evangel, that are nowhere taught in the Word of Divine Truth, by wresting the Scrip- tures to suit men's preconceived views. First, the doctrine, -simple yet sublime,-that of love to God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, was laid aside. Men desired to do something to merit salvation, - were not willing that God's own agent-the Holy Spirit--should do the work for -them; they wished to have a   hand in it themselves, so they attached  regenerative Power to- baptism. This once  done the- w ay was clearly open for the next fearful  step, infant baptism. For if baptism regenerated, . -intro-      3 duced the recipient of it into the kingdom of Christ-then       X of course--and it is a  legitimate inference--all who are not baptized are not regenerated, are outside this king- domn, and consequently are in an unsaved state.

"' I see this clearly, Herbert, but what about this argu- ment of Mr. Nailom respecting circumcision?" "This is not the original argument for infant baptism, Evangel; it was introduced after the Reformation, to meet the practice of those who, retaining the error of infant sprinkling, while they repudiated the false doctrine of baptismal regeneration, must needs have some reason for that practice. So not finding any direct authority for it in the New Testament, but only that of an inferential nature, they went back to the Jewish dispensation, and finding circumcision the seal of the covenant of blessings promised to Abraham, they inferred that baptism had come in its stead, and as male children of the Jewish nation had been circumcised, all children of believing parents should be baptized. And thus 'this class of advocates for infant baptism urge the covenant argument with great show of truthfulness and power, as the Rev. Mr. Nailom is doing. But when we come to look at the covenant made by God with Abraham, we find that it was to give the land of Canaan to his posterity for an inheritance, and also that 'the circumcision instituted was the seal of a temporal covenant, a national sign to keep the Jews a distinct people forever. And to-day we find every male child of Jewish parents circumcised. Jesus himself was circumcised the eighth day, as a national descendant of David. He was also baptized, not to do away with circumcision, or in its stead, but to prefigure the death He should die and IIis resurrection-the only hope of the salvation of a world lost by reason of sin." Evangel stood wondering. She could not as yet fully'  see the points her husband had so clearly made, but the   Mrs. Vernon's Recital.      449 light had begun to enter, and she felt that there was truly another side to the covenant argument, beside the ,one so vehemently insisted upon by Rev. Mr. Nailom. The door-bell rang. "Motherl We will go down and see about the baby. But wait, Herbert, you remain here, and I will bring her up. I would rather we should see her alone." Evangel speedily returned. It was a messenger from Mrs. Falkland, requesting her to come immediately. "What shall I do, Herbert?" "' Go, by all means, darling." "But I cannot, until I ascertain from mother whether Vernon was taken to Father O'Reilly's and baptized P "Perhaps you had better write Mrs. Falkland a note, informing her that you will be over, immediately after dinner, and if your mother does not come before we dine, I will take you by there on your way to Mrs. Falkland's.", Evangel follotwed  her husband's suggestion.  As she dismissed the messenger, dinner was announced. Mes, Vernon had not arrived.  William  Wiseman and Mr. Carlton, who had been out driving, called for a moment to inform them that their Kentucky friends would leave that afternoon for Louisville, and requested the ladies to call around at the hotel before their departure. Lilly and Kitty Knowlton returned from their morning shopping. The gentlemen accepted the pressing invitation to remain to dinner. Mrs. Wiseman did the honors of the table as best she could under the distracting circumstances. The gentlemen and lady guests maintained an animated conversation on various subjects. 'Miss Delia gave attention to the baby. She questioned him closely about his expedition to the      I priest's, and whether or not he had been baptized and had    I 29  I     450       Evangel Wiseman.- worn the robe or cap on the occasion. But the little fellow only smiled and cooed, and said not a word. : It was decided that Lilly, accompanied by the two gen- tlemen should call by Dr. Cheney's for Miss Fannie, and proceed to the hotel, while Mr. Wiseman took Mr. Carl. ton's buggy for the drive to Mr. Falkland's by way of Mr. Vernon's. -' I shall return next week, Herbert," said William Wise. man to his brother as he bade him adieu. "I shall only! go as far as Louisville to-night with the party, and after visiting our old friends there, the Ewings and Marshalls, will return and pass the summer with you-Carlton and I are delighted with your city.'" Mr. Wiseman laughed significantly. Lilly blushed deeply, despite her efforts to keep down the rising color. Mr. Carlton looked interestingly confused, as he bowed assent to his friend's statement, and the three set out for Dr. Cheney's. Explaining the circumstances to her ftiends, whom she , let, in charge of Miss Delia, Mrs. Wiseman proceeded with -her husband to call upon her mother. She found Mrs. Vernon had just returned from her walk, and had thrown Iherself on the couch to rest. The anxious parents now made known the object of their call.                       " ":Vernon was not baptized by the priest. Could not have been, I think," she said in answer to their eager questioning. Evangel breathed more freely. The great weight that oppressed her soul was lifted. Mr. Wiseman looked more cheerful.                  "And you think, mother," he rejoined, "that Bridget, could not have had time to reach the priest's and return when you encountered her?"   Mrs. Vernon's Recital.       451 "Oh, I am confident, Herbert, that she could not. It was but little after eight o'clock. I was going over to see you, Evangel, about Lilly's purchases to-day. I decided She had perhaps better wait until next week before she gets her summer dresses, and as I was going up La Salle street, I saw Bridget with the baby in her arms, walking as fast as she could come. I at first supposed she was bringing him over to see us, but before I 'met her she turned up Clay. I don't know whether or not she saw me. I hastened on, and, reaching the corner, called as loudly to her as I could. At first she evidently did not hear me. So I ran after her, and, calling all the time at the top of my voice, at length I arrested her atten- tion, and she turned and came to me. I thought she looked confused, but then it may  have been she was only flurried from fast walking. I asked her where she was going. 'Only. to hev a little mornin' walk, be shure, Mrs. Vernon,' she said; but when I discovered the box, and questioned her about it, she was evidently disturbed, but replied she was bringing the baby out to see us, and as you intended to have him baptized in the Presbyterian church to-morrow-Dr. Peterson's- she thought she would bring the robe and cap, and dress him up that we might see how sweet he looked. I was greatly surprised at this latter statement, so I decided that as you were out, I would make some calls this morning, and come over after dinner     I to see about the proposed baptism." "What a fortunate circumstance that you met her just when you   did! A  minute more, and she would have been able to consummate her plan which, evidently, was to take Vernon to priest O'Reilly's, dress him up for the occasion, have him sprinkled, and return before the ladies should get back from  their shopping. You may dismiss       i     452       Evangel Wiseman. all anxiety about his baptism by the priest, darling," he said, turning to Evangel; "it is not possible that she should have been there before your mother saw her. And I suppose, Mrs. Vernon, that she could not have called after she left you?" COh, no, I am sure she did not. I took her with me to cousin Mary Parkham's, which you know is quite out of the way of the priest's--he is on St. Augustine street, next door to the Catholic church, I believe-and kept her there- until she set out for home. What time did she reach you?" "About half-past eleven." "Well, she could not have tarried on the way. But what about the baptism to-morrow, Herbert? Is it true you are going to have him baptized in Dr. Peterson's church?" 4 Of course not. Bridget has heard aunt Delia say some- thing about desiring this done, but you can readily perceive from the fact that she was bearing the baby to the priest's, that she knew it would not take place. It- was only to extricate herself from the dilemma in which she found herself when you met her with the"baby and the box, that she said this." Satisfied that all was right, Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman drove to Mr. Falkland's. Dr. Peterson's church was crowded on Sunday morning,  many from other congregations being present to witness  the baptism of the babies. Mr. Nailom did not preach as 6 was expected. His vocation was that of a lecturer. He could say far more for the rite- of infant baptism than he  could for the necessity of repentance toward, and faith in   Sunday's  Baptisms.       453 Jesus. Infant baptism is subversive of believer's baptism, the only baptism Jesus and his disciples taught and practiced. Infant membership founded on infant baptism overthrows the whole system of the gospel dispensation. Man-made christians are not of that kingdom that the Lord Jesus came into the world to set up--that kingdom which is founded on his d6ath is carried on by the Holy Spirit through such instrumentalities as He selects. Mr. Peterson delivered a sermon suitable for the occa- sion. He dwelt most lengthily on the covenant made with Abraham, its seal, circumcision, and asserted, without any attempt to prove the verity of his statement, that, under the gospel dispensation, baptism had taken the place of circumcision under the Mosaic dispensation, and, per consequence, children should be baptized. He then portrayed in glowing terms the sanctity and beauty of the rite-the duty of all parents who believed, to have their children thus dedicated to the Lord. He read over each one of the household baptisms, and inferred babies in each case. He also quoted these texts, "Suffer little children," and "The promise is unto you and your chil- dren," and "Now are your children holy," etc., etc., and closed by: urging all believing parents to bring forward their children for baptism without delay, portraying to them the blessed results of this course of obedience. Thirteen children--unconscious little ones who could not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,--were presented to be baptized into the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Major Boswell was present, solemnly presiding over his fiive, some of whom looked on wonderingly, while the two little fellows were perfectly indifferent. Mrs. Bos- well filled her seat in Dr. Eaton's church at morning services, not in the most peaceable frame of mind, as     454       Evangel Wiseman. may well be supposed, but quietly determined that, des. pite the "baby sprinkling," every child of hers should be a Baptist, if the Lord should be pleased to convert- their souls. Some of the little folks demurred most lustily against the administration, and one wee bit of a boy was so refractory that it took all the quieting the poor worried mother could do, before he would allow the minister to put the drops of water on his face. It was a triumph for the Pedo-baptists of Chester. Such a scene for impres- siveness had never before been witnessed in Dr. Peterson's church. The few Baptists who attended through curiosity felt decidedly crest-fallen, and began to think that perhaps after all this thing of sprinkling babies, though very mean- ingless to them, must have some good foundation to stand upon, else it would have been overthrown long ago. Mr. Nailom sat beside Dr. Peterson in the pulpit, and stood beside him as he performed the ceremony. Never  was there a more self-satisfied, complacent-looking man to be seen. He smiled as if all the "thirteen" were his own, and he felt assured that now they were of the king- dom of heaven. He continued his lectures to, full houses through the week, until Thursday, and then receiving his reward, one hundred dollars, he bade adieu to Chester for some other point where he would pursue the same course with simi- lar result.   The Marriage.        455 CHAPTER XXX. THE MARRIAGE. IJ NDER the unremitting attentions of Dr. Bassonett, JU Maud Mordaunt, after a dreadful struggle for life, began to improve slowly. William Nesbitt scarcely left the house. All the world to him was centered in that quiet, darkened room, and, whenever allowed, he would sit beside Maud, and gaze upon her with the utmost tenderness, anticipating every desire, and administering every attention possible. I have lived for your sakeWillie," said Maud to him one day, as he sat holding her hand so tenderly, and looking, with an expression of the deepest love, into her clear, soft eyes. "You are all I have in the world to love, Willie, and had not it been for you, I should have died most willingly rather than have suffered what I have done; and then, Willie, do you know'" and she paused for a long while, the tears rushing to her eyes and falling on her pillow, "do you know, Willie, the physicians say I may never walk again. If ever I do, it will be a long while first. Can you love me, Willie, an invalid, perhaps for life?" "Love you, Maud? Yes! now and forever,-love you all the better for your sufferings. Without you, life would be worthless: with you the world is as beautiful to me as Paradise was to our first parents. Oh, how could you imagine for a moment, dearest, that I should not love you because you were afflicted!" "I did not know this, Willie, until yesterday. If dear     Dr. Bassonett was convinced of it before, he never inti- mated it. I wished to tell you this morning, when you were in, but I could not; I feared it would be too great a shock for you. But Mrs. Falkland said you must know it, and it would be best for me to tell you. You see, she thinks I am quite a heroine, to bear this weight myself, and to communicate the knowledge of it to you." And the brave girl smiled cheerfully as she saw the tears of sym- pathy stream down the young man's cheeks. "I love you, Maud I Have never loved another! Shall never love again," he said passionately. "It will be weeks before you can leave your bed, months before you can leave your room; why not now-this very day-become my wife, and let me prove to you the depths of my love?" She did not reply, but the big tears rolled rapidly down her cheeks. " Do not deny me, Maud, this happiness. There can be no wisdom in postponing our marriage. You need my love and sympathy now. My life shall be given to your happiness. Say, Maud, will you become my wife now?" "Willie," she said, pressing his hand lovingly, "one who has been so near death, and must, perhaps forever, be a sufferer, cannot disguise; I must speak the truth, calmly. I love you as I never dreamed it possible for my orphaned heart to love any one; and I know you love me truly, sincerely, and would give your life for my happiness. But, Willie, life is real, it is practical to a great extent. The time may come, as little as you think it now, when you may feel I am a burden to you; when you -may regret what will then seem a hasty, injudicious step. When you mix again with the world and see other men-your friends -introducing their wives into society, where they will   lend a charm to life, and you are made to draw the painful contrast of your own fate, will not your heart rebel? will not your hopes be crushed? Will you not then repent that you allowed yourself to be bound to one who shall know life only in the circle of home-who shall,never mingle in the busy affairs of society?" "No, Maud, my dearest! 2Never, never! Never will I repent that my life is linked with yours I But next to my trust in a risen Saviour, it will ever be my greatest joy to live for you! Oh, Maud, I beseech you, do me not the injustice to indulge such thoughts! They pain my heart to breaking  I have seen the world, know what it is; its pleasures are short-lived and unsatisfying. I am made for domestic life; I know I am. I need not mingle in the trade and traffic of business; I have ample means for all demands that can possibly arise. My life shall be devoted to you! Only say, Maud, that you will accept the offering, and confer on me all of happiness that this life can give?" He held her hand grasped in his, and with unspeakable earnestness, gazed into her sweet calm face, turned toward him with such a beautiful look, as only a woman's love and gratitude can express. She said, smiling through her tears: "Willie, it is too much! The sacrifice is too great for you to make. I dare not accept it. Wait and see the result; it may not be so serious as the doctors think for; then, if I am restored, and can be a help-meet unto you- you know your Bible says that, Willie-then, I may become your wife." He blanched white as marble, and fixed upon her a look of wild despair. He endeavored to speak, but the words died out before they were formed. The poor girl was frightened as she beheld- his livid face, and terror-struck    458       Evangel Wiseman. gaze, and as she read in them the depths of his love for her. Raising her hand to his face, and patting his cheek, as if she would call him back from the fearful region of hope. less sorrow, she said: "Willie, Willie, speak to me! It shall be as you desire. If you will take me in my helplessness, I will be your wife!" "I would take you, Maud, take you gladly, were you a thousand times more helpless than you are now l"And he bent over her and kissed her again and again, weeping as a child for very joy.' "You will be my wife, then? May the Lord bless you for this decision, which seals my earthly happiness forever. Now, I shall walk the earth a strong man in your love, Maud; without it, I should be but a blasted, upriven tree, prostrate-dead. And now, Maud, one more favor. Marry me now this very day. Why should we delay? Let me devote my life to you as one who has a right to do so Shall I send for a minister?" "Not to-day, Willie, but to-morrow. I fear the excite- ment would be too much for me now. Let me accustom my thoughts to it, then I shall go through with it with the' greatest composure, and without detriment to myself. You; would not have me made worse!" "No, no, dearest. Let it be as you say, only do not  delay longer, than to-morrow. For whom shall I send,  have you any preference?" "Yes, Willie, I prefer your minister, Dr. Eaton. A year ago I should have regarded it no marriage at all, unless a Catholic priest had officiated. But since I have been with Mrs. Falkland, and attended the meeting, and have heard Dr. Eaton read the Scriptures and preach, I   The Marriage.         459 find that you Baptists possess something which my church does not teach, and my conscience tells me you are right." This something, Maud, is the regeneration of the heart by the Holy Spirit of God, and is something distinct and apart from all the works and ordinances of man. And may the Holy Spirit lead you, my dear Maud, to see and embrace this great truth!" "Oh, I shall some of these days be a Baptist, Willie, for your sake." "No, no, dearest, not for my sake, but for truth's sake. May I read to you,. Maud, from my Bible?" "Yes, do, I shall be glad to hear. I have always felt such a reverence for the Bible, and yet I never read a chapter in it in all my life until I came into this house. I found one on my table, beside the vase of flowers. Through curiosity I opened it, and the first thing that met % my eyes were these words: 'The blood of Jesus Christ, His son, cleanseth us from all sin.' I don't know where it is; I had never heard it before, but the words riveted themselves in my mind, and I have said them over and over a hundred times to myself. And when I have heard your minister talking about the redemption which Christ wrought, and calling upon all to come to Jesus for salva- tion, I have sat and said to myself, 'Yes, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin. It is the blood, the blood, and not penance and priests."' "This is the teaching of God's word, dear Maud, it is the blood of Jesus which washes away our sins." Mrs. Falkland and Dr. Bassonett entered the room together.  William Nesbitt, his face radiant with the joy that filled his bosom, told them of his wish and Maud's acqui- escence, and asked their approval of the step. - '     "O       Evangel Wiseman. "Yes, William, you have my full consent," Mrs. Falk. land answered, as the young man stood before her awaiting her reply to his question-" it may be yours also, Doctor!" "Yes, yes, my dear Mrs. Falkland," he interrupted her, seizing her hand. "My Maud has told me all, and 'tis this, 'tis this that impels me to make her my wife, that my life may be given up to her comfort. What does Dr. Bassonett say?" he added, turning to the physician, who stood beside his patient with a kind, fatherly look fixed upon her smiling, blushing face. 'It will be a wise step, Willie," the Doctor rejoined, almost envying the young man his happiness; "and may Heaven's richest blessings rest on you both!"His voice faltered, and the tears gathered in his eyes, but he sup.. pressed them, and with a calm, sweet smile, said: "My girl, is better to-day. Joy is a more efficacious medicine than all our nostrums." The preparations made for this unique marriage were few and Pimple. It was too beautiful in its purity and devotion to be marred by the blandishments of fame or fashion. Mrs. Falkland wrote a note to a few intimate friends. Willie Nesbitt called on his pastor, Dr. Eaton, and engaged his services for the following morning at ten. He then drove to his brothers, and acquainted them with his inten- tion, and asked them to be witnesses of the happy event. His friends; DeWitt, Carlton and William Wiseman, were also asked. Mrs. Falkland sent a note to Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman, and Willie desired her to include Miss Delia, who had been his mother's friend, and who had always loved him, and taken an abiding interest in him until he united with the Baptist church; since which she was evidently much   The Marriage.        461 less devoted. The underlying motive with Miss Delia was an anxious desire that Willie, whom she truly loved, should marry Lilly. He was of excellent disposition, no bad habits, good parentage, and master of a larige estate in his own right. 'So the provident aunt, looking out for the future welfare of her niece, had selected William Nesbitt for a husband for her, and had fondly cherished the hope, until Wilhe had dashed it by. becoming a Baptist. After this, Miss Delia's views changed. The morrow came, calm and beautiful as earthly day could be. The sick-room was made ready and ornamented with beautiful flowers. The joyous invalid, far more lovely in her affliction than she could have been in the full bloom of health, was attired in befitting costume. Her dark hair was thrown back from her perfect forehead, and lay like a soft, rich veil over the snowy pillows that supported her. Amid its wavy wealth was placed a wreath of bridal flowers, and the magnificent white lace shawl that fell in soft, ample folds over the alabaster shoulders and bosom, was fastened with a beau- tiful ornament. She wore no jewelry but the ring Willie had given her. The fractured arm reposed on a soft cushion, its beautiful form just visible through the delicate fabric of the shawl. Wreaths of pure white flowers hung pendant from the canopy overhead, and bouquets of rare exotics lay about her; scattered over the delicately blue tinted satin spread. She looked the fairy queen of the flowers. The hour came. Loving and kind friends assembled in this room, hallowed by suffering and love. William Nesbitt stood beside the bed and held the pure white hand lovingly in his. Dr. Eaton prayed a solemn, fervent invocation of bless.     "2.      Evangel Wiseman. ings on these two young loving hearts, that were, under providences so peculiar, about to enter upon the journey of life together. Hle then went though with the formula, and the two became man and wife, in the presence of God and the witnesses. It was as beautifully solemn as if angels from the upper spheres were present to hallow it. All wept with the impressiveness of the scene. Dr. Bas. sonett stood at the head of the bed, with tears streaming over his manly face. He had learned through sympathy to love Maud most devotedly, and he felt as if he were giving away his own child. "Mine forever!" said William Nesbitt, as he bent over Maud and kissed her. She looked up through her tears and put her arm around his neck.  It was touchingly beautiful. Unrestrained by forms, these loving hearts thus gave vent to the deep emotions which thrilled them. That marriage scene was never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Very soon after his marriage, William Nesbitt purchased a beautiful suburban residence, and had it fitted up with everything that could gratify the taste of his adored wife. Her boudoir was a perfect gem of beauty.  The. library into which it opened was filled with choicest books -and pictures, and medallions, and intaglios, and statuettes, were diffused in charming taste throughout the various :apartments. A new piano and guitar were placed at her disposal. She played on both instruments and sang ;sweetly. The grounds were laid out with exquisite artistic -taste, and flowers of many a clime were placed in the conservatory. Singing birds of rare species were pur- :chased; and the little lake, fed by the fountain, on which -he window of the boudoir opened, was filled with many   The Marriage.         463 colored fishes. The carpets were, beautiful moquette and all the furniture of the most exquisite pattern and finish. When all was made as complete as taste and munificence combined could do, a beautiful phaeton with a span of fine black horses was driven to the door of Mrs. Falk- land's residence, and Maud was borne to her new home. Her arm was strong again, the color had come back to her cheeks, but the foot that had been so badly crushed was useless; she could not walk a step alone. Placed in a large fautenil, which stood awaiting her at the front, verandah, she was wheeled by her maid through the beauti- ful apartments, her husband ever beside her, until at last she was carried to her own apartment, where chaste elegance and beautiful adaptation seemed the result of fairy hands.  She had no words to express her delight and gratitude. She threw her arms about her husband, who was sitting beside her, and wept out her delight on his bosom. "And now, Willie," said she, " our home must be the home of dear old Dr. Bassonett. He has no one to love him, and to him we are indebted for all our happiness; for, had he not watched over me those weary days and nights when my life seemed balanced in the scale, I should certainly have died. Oh those hours, Willie, you never knew what I suffered. But I was determined to live for    * you!" And Dr. Bassonett was invited the very next day. And gladly did he accept the invitation to exchange the dis- comforts and inelegances of a boarding house for a retreat in such an earthly paradise.     OIL       & ivangei Wiseman. CHAPTER XXXI. DR. EATON AS A LECTURER. WA    E will leave our loving friends to the enjoyment of their beautiful home, and of the bliss that pure deep love bestows, to return to other scenes and other considerations. On the Tuesday night following the close of Rev. Mr. Nailom's course of lectures, Dr. Eaton commenced in the Baptist church a series of replies. The house from night to night was filled to overflowing. A spirit of inquiry on religious subjects had been aroused in the community, and men's minds were called to the investigation of the subjects of infant baptism and of believers' baptism, in a way not often known. The meeting held by Rev. Mr. Earle had brought the Baptists so fully before the public mind, that everybody felt more or less interest in the denomination, and Pedo- Baptists, having been brought under their influence for the first time in Chester, had to acknowledge and respect it. Dr. Eaton, too, was very favorably known as a man of culture and the highest literary attainments. His family had at once taken a social position which they were fully able to, maintain, and their evident piety made them loved by all with whom they associated. And Mr. Wiseman's power as a lawyer of ability and integrity was strengthen- ing and expanding in a rapid ratio. Opponents of the faith held by Baptists, no longer called them ignorant and bigoted, nor ranked them as inferior in social position.   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.      465 So that when Dr. Eaton announced that he would reply to the Rev. Mr. Nailom, and show the unscripturalness and fallacy of his premises and deductions, everybody was on tip-toe to hear him. The tide of reaction had already begun to set in against Mr. Nailom. His very unscrupu- lous manner of attacking those who differed from him- his ungentlemanly and abusive epithets and ridicule, his stock of slang phrases and peculiar cognomens, his occa- sional misrepresentations of known historical facts; the statement, generally believed, that he had once belonged to the Current Reformation, and was then as rampant against sprinkling and all Pedo-Baptist practices, as he was now vehement in their advocacy; and perhaps, above all, the widely extended impression that his efforts and zeal had their foundation in the love of the reward he received-all conspired to weaken the cause he had so valiantly espoused and practically defended. It was also known to a great many of his hearers, that he had shame- fully misrepresented the covenant made with Abraham, and had imposed upon those who were ignorant the belief that it was a churchly and spiritual compact, when it only related to the land of Canaan. In his first lecture, Dr. Eaton, after having premised that in order to establish a divine ordinance we must have divine authority for it, and in matters of positive moment we must have positive warrant, proceeded to prove conclusively, that if infant children of believing parents are proper subjects for church membership, the authority for it is not found in the covenant made with Abraham, of which circumcision was the sign and ,seal. Paul, in Galatians 3: 17, speaks of a covenant conferred before, of God in Christ, "which the law, given four hundred  and thirty years after, could not annul, that it should  make the promise of none effect."     30 Is *       M     "6       Evangel Wiseman. Now this covenant, spoken of by Paul, was made with Abraham while he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Ammon- ite, and before he had taken Hagar to wife, and consequently before the birth of Ishmael. The time that elapsed between  it and the giving of the law on Sinai, one hundred and, thirty years, is thus computed by the learned Parens: "From the confirmation of the covenant to the. birth of Isaac, - -  -  -      -  15 years From the birth of Isaac to the birth of Jacob,* 60 " From the birth of Jacob to his going down into Egypt,  -        -  -   180 Firom his going down into Egypt to his death, ' -           -  -   17 " From the death of Jacob to the death of Joseph,s -    -  -  -  -  -  -  53 " From the death of Joseph to the birth of Moses, 75 " From the birth of Moses to the giving of the law,t -      .  -  *  -  -  -  80 " 430 years. "Now the covenant, of which circumcision was the seal was made with Abraham   when Ishmael was thirteen years old. And these are the words of the covenant then made: 'I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will qmake nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee,  and thy seed after thee in thy generations for an ever- lasting covenant to be a God unto them and to thy seed after thee, and I will give unto thee and thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession. I will be their God. And God said unto Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, *. enesis 25 26. tIbid47: 9. tIbid 47: 28. Ibid 50: 26. .   ...   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.      467 between me and you and thy seed after thee: every man child among you shall be circumcised.' * "This latter covenant sealed by circumcision was given some years after the other, which Paul speaks of as con- firned by God in Christ, and had reference to the temporal prosperity of Abraham and his seed and the bestowment of the land of Canaan on him and his seed after him. This is the covenant that is spoken of by David in the 105th Psalm, which the Lord God 'made with Abraham and His oath unto Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.' It does not stipulate for spiritual blessings at all, and no one has any warrant to deduce such a con- clusion, since the covenant is stated in express words. The first covenant which was confirmed} of God in Christ, had for its ratification the offering of sacrifice. 'For God said to Abraham, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old.' 'And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and leaned each piece one against another, but the birds divided he not. And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold a smok- ing furnace and a burning lamp that passed between these pieces.' The covenant of circumcision, made fifteen years after this, was a temporal covenant, and did not include 3piritual but temporal blessings-the inheritance of the land of Canaan and the multiplying of the seed of Abra- ham. And this covenant has nothing to do with Abraham's spiritual seed, and is absolutely of no avail in favor of nfant baptism."' Dr. Eaton then gave a passing notice to the Rev. Mr. *-enesis 17: 6-10.      "8       Evangel Wiseman. Nailom's proof of infant church membership, which that lecturer deduced from Joel 2: 15, 16, "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a feast, call a solemn assembly. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet." Dr. Eaton showed, if this call on the part of the prophet Joel to " the children and them that suck the breasts," placed them in-the church, then the call of the prophet Jonah, which resulted in the belief and repentance of the Ninevites,' not only placed children in the church, but also the beasts. "For the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a feast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest even to the least of them. And the king caused to be published throughout Nineveh, saying: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste any- thing. Let them  not feed nor drink water. But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God. And God saw their wishes that they, leaned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil He had said he would do unto them, and He did it not." The audience saw at once the ridiculousness of the lecturer; and his very peculiar method of impressing his congregation with this portion of his argument- that is by spelling the word s-u-c-k and then turning to some one beside him to pronounce it for him-was thrown back upon himself. After giving the Rev. lecturer's Old Testament argu- ments a complete refutation, Dr. Eaton entered upon Mr. Nailom's proof from the New Testament. That gentleman argued that though the commission commands believers to be baptized, yet it did not, by any means, exclude the infants of believers. "But I assert," said Dr. Eaton,   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.      469 ' and that without fear of contradiction, that this commis- sion of our Lord, which enjoins believer's baptism, neces- sarily excludes unbelievers; and as infants cannot believe, they are in no wise included in the command. In the words of the great Carson," he added, "' It is impossible that a command to baptize believers can be extended to include any but believers.' No command, no explanation can bring unbelievers into the commission that enjoins the baptism of believers. Even if it should be found there was another command for the baptism of the infants of believers, I should say this is not included in the apostolical commis- sion. This is another commission, and cannot interfere with the former. It would establish the baptism of infants, it is true, but it would not be according to this commission, nor included in it. A commission to baptize the infants of believers, could not be according to the commission to baptize believers, and there would be two baptisms. the one on the ground of faith, the other on the ground of descent.                    : "The commission to baptize believers does not indeed imply that it is impossible that another commission might have been given to baptize infants, but by necessity it excludes them forever from being included in this com- mand. If infants are baptized, it is from another commis- sion, and it is another baptism, founded on another prin- ciple. "Will our friends give us the authority for infant bap- tism? If it is in the Bible, it can be found and pointed out. Will they do it? "And again," added the Doctor, with his usual pungency, "even if we should find a commission for the baptism of infants, it could not, by any means, set aside the duty of the believer to be baptized. If an individual has been     470       Evangel Wiseman. baptized a dozen times in unbelief, it is his imperative duty to be baptized when he does believe. So we readily perceive that this baptism of unbelieving infants is not only not to be found in the commission given by the Saviour to his Apostles, but that it sets at defiance that commission by doing away with believer's baptism. An injury to the child-a defiance of the express command of Christ. Who hath required this at your hands, my friends? i But," continued Dr. Eaton, " if we do not find infants included in the commission, but wholly excluded there- from, yet if we can find that one new-born babe was bap- tized by the Apostles, it would be as valid for our example as if thousands of instances were given, and would prove there was another baptism, but not at all interfering with the baptism of believers. "Let us, for a short time, look at the preaching and practice of the Apostles: Peter, on the day of Pentecost, preached baptism to the multitudes. Did he preach infant baptism? Listen to his words, and then decide for yourselves, my friends, whether it was unconscious babes, or those who could repent and exercise faith, who were called upon to be baptized.- Hear the account: 'Then Peter said unto them: Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.' Now the record tells us that ' they that gladly received his word were baptized.' Now it was simply impossible for infants to gladly receive his word, so it is impossible that infants were baptized, for they alone are said to have been bap- tized 'who gladly received the word.' "The next account of baptism we have, is where Phillip was preaching in Samaria. It is given in Acts 8 : 12. These are the words: 'But when they believed Phillip's   ^ '           '  Dr. Egaton as a Lecturer.      471 preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.' Here the Holy Spirit expressly mentions women; why would not infants have been also mentioned, if they had been baptized? Women could believe', did believe, and consequently were baptized, but infants could not believe, and therefore were not baptized. "The account of the Eunuch requires the same order: 'If thou believest, thou mayest be baptized.' "We see in each of these instances, that infants were not, could not, have been baptized; so there is no authority in the preaching and practice of the Apostles, as far, a. we have examined, for the baptism of unbelieving children. "Let us now look at the household baptisms, this strong entrenchment for the advocates of the practice we are now showing to be without authority and unscriptural: "The Apostles baptized households or families; of this there is no doubt. The instances of Lydia, of the jailor, and of Stephanus, stand on record for our instruction. Let us look at them,-they were baptized households. Who can prove there were children in either one of them?  But admitting that children-infants--were a component part of each of these three households, who can prove that they were baptized?  The commission excludes theml Where       1 is there authority to baptize them? "Let us look at the case of Lydia. It must first be proved that she was married, then that she had children, and then that there were infants among these children. , All these steps must be made sure, before we can even show that there were babies; and even if it were proved beyond the possibility of a doubt, that infants were a part of the household, yet they have not been baptized, for there is no authority for this baptism. What straits the support-      472       Evangel Wiseman. eon of infant baptism must be in, to have to resort to such proof in support of their practicel These same points need to be made clear beyond the possibility of a doubt, to show that there were infants in either of the other households; and even if you prove that there were, you have not yet any authority for infant baptism, for these families were believing- families, and therefore baptized. If infants were there, they could not believe, and according to the commission of the Lord Jesus, they were not baptized. If in a believing house there may have been unbelieving infants, so in a baptized house there may have been unbaptized infants. "In the case of the jailor, it is said, he rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. Here we see a believing house- hold, and consequently a baptized household. "In the case of Stephanus, Paul informs us that they being the first-fruits of Achaia, that they had addicted *   themselves to the ministry of the saints, which could not possibly be said of infants. "I think it is evident beyond any cavil, that there is no proof of infant baptism from the household baptisms recorded. "You see, my friends, that there is no authority for infant baptism  in the commission-no instance of it recorded in the cases of baptism mentioned either in the ' households or otherwise. Where; then, shall we find the authority or example? "We will now examine the passages that are sometimes produced in proof: The first is the text in Matt. 19 : 13, 15, 'Then were brought unto him little children, that He should put his hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them, but Jesus said, Suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven; and He- laid his hands on them and departed thence."   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.      473 "How can infant baptism be learned from these words? Does our Saviour's condescension to children suppose that they must have been baptized? The purpose for which they were brought to Christ is expressly stated 'that He should put His hands on them, and pray.' How can bap- tism even be inferred from these words? Ohe who will do so must be as destitute of understanding as were the children Christ blessed. We are commanded to be like children, hut in what particular? ' In malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.' "Our Pedo-Baptist friends find infant baptism in Matt. 18: 1,7, ' At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying: Who is the greatest in the kingdom  of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said:  Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted,' and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven; whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom  of heaven; and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me; but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the      i sea.' "Our Pedo-Bapiist friends argue thus on this passage: ' The meaning of this passage seems to be,' say they, ' that of such kind of infants as these is the kingdom of God, that is, of such infants as have been partakers of the seal of the covenant-of such infants as have been baptized, or at least circumcised like these.' Let me ask my friends who argue thus, where and when were these children baptized?  We have found no baptism for children in the     i Bible. When, and by what authority were these little ones         474       Evangel Wiseman.  baptized? Surely; there is nothing either expressed or implied with respect to the baptism or circumcision of these children, nor are the words of Jesus more applicable to these than to any other children. He does not say, 'Suffer these little baptized or circumcised children to come,' but, ' Suffer little children to come,' all children, any children. It was not because they were baptized or circumcised, but because they are teachable, humble, con. fiding, obey their parents, and are without those ambitious and selfish features which characterize older persons. This passage, as the other, has no hint of infant baptism-- none can be drawn from it. The advocates of the practice themselves disagree with regard to the meaning of the words of the Saviour, and the wisest of them testify against such authority. "Jeremy Taylor thus testifies: 'From the action of Christ's blessing infants, to infer that they were baptized, proves nothing so much as that there is a want of better argument. For the conclusion would, with more proba- bility, be derived thus: Christ blessed children, and so dismissed them, but baptized them not, therefore infants are not to be .baptized.' "Olshausen, remarking on the passage, says: I Of that reference to infant baptism which it is so common to seek in this narrative, there is clearly not the slightest trace to be found.' "Doddridge says:  'I acknowledge these words will not, of themselves, prove infant baptism to be an institu- tion of Christ.' "Professor Jacobi: 'In support of infant baptism, we hardly rely on this appeal to Matt. 19: 14. "It remains for us, my friends, to look at Cor. 7, 14: 'For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife,   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.       475 and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.' "If this passage proves infant baptism, my friends, you see it also proves, as conclusively, the baptism of the un- believing wife, or the unbelieving husband. These are as much entitled to baptism as the children. They are, according to our Pedo-Baptist friends' arguments, sancti- fied by the relation they sustain to the converted husbands or wives. And we have the fearful but inevitable conclu- sion, that any man or woman, even the most ignorant idolater, if he or she but be connected by the marriage relation to a believer, can, because of such relation, be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. "Now   it is evident that this sanctification here spoken of, refers to legitimacy according to the law of God. Marriages of this kind were not lawful to the Jews, both the wives and the children had to be put away. "The Apostle here is arguing that, as the followers of Christ are commanded to marry in the Lord, every marriage of this kind would have to be given up on the repentance of either party. But Christ made this beau- tiful provision, so that when one party should become a believer, the marriage relation should nevertheless remain as before. It is a  shame to deduce the baptism of the      I unbelieving wife or husband, or the unbelieving children, from this text. "Peter, in his memorable sermon on the day of Pen- tecost, uses these words: 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.'     476       Evangel Wiseman.              "This text is also quoted to prove infant baptism. It is said by them, that when the Apostle added, 'to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God: shall call,' the meaning plainly is that the promise which was to the Jews first, and to their children, should be to the Gentiles and to their children. The promise is doubt- less, my friends, to the Gentiles and to their children; that is, on repentance they shall be made partakers of the gift of the Holy Spirit. But this promise, made to the Gentiles and to their 'children, is based on the repentance of the Gentiles, and the repentance of their children. ' Repent,' said Peter, and the sacred word adds, 4Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized.' 'And now," added Dr. Eaton," "we sum    up the matter, and find there is no infant baptism, either in the  Abrahamic covenant, or in the command of the prophet Joel, to gather together the elders, and them that suck at the breast; none in the commission of our Lord, given to the Apostles; none in the instances recorded of the preaching of the word followed by baptism,--for in all these cases, we find belief first, then baptism; none in the household baptisms; and none in the passages so often quoted and so variously tortured to give countenance to this unscriptural rite. In a word, no authority, either in the Old or New Testament Scriptures, for a practice that had its origin in a sad departure from the wofd of Divine truth, and in the misconception that baptism was regeneration, and has been perpetuated through the ages by those who have been willing to take the traditions of men instead of the commands of God. It has proved a fearful error in all ages of the world: In the Catholic church, retaining as members all who were sprinkled in infancy; in the Episcopal church, requiring only that the   Dr. Eaton as a Lecturer.      4" candidate who has received it in unconscious infancy shall be confirmed without any evidence of change of heart-of being born again; arid in the Presbyterian church, in thousands and thousands of cases doing away with believer's baptim-the only baptism taught in God's word; and in all cases, and under all circumstances, administering, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, a rite, which they teach is of divine origin, which was unknown to Christ and his Apostles, and to the churches for about two hundred years.

BAPTISMAL REGENERATION. - HE lecture of the preceding evening had aroused the deepest interest. Never before had Infant Bap- +    tism been placed in its true light before the com- -munity as regards its scriptural authority. Hundreds of men and women had believed the Bible was full of teaching on this point, and like Miss Delia had so contended, although they had never been able themselves to find it. How many e in every community are led by the few on subjects of vital importance, rather than search for the truth for themselves I The force of early education is so strong and so lasting, that it takes a clear perception, a vigorous mind, and a spirit that will honor God at all sacrifices of prejudice, taste and earthly ties, to throw it off and proclaim the soul free from its shackles. , Everywhere the exposition of Dr. Eaton was the subject i ^ of remark and discussion. The Pedo-baptist friends felt their foundation dreadfully shaken. Those who had been    a led along by the seeming logic of the Rev. Mr. Nailom, , were taken quite aback when they were convinced of the errors in his proof, and his unfair manner of presenting the truths of the Scripture. Many Baptists who had quaked with fear, now not only felt re-instated, but quite built up in the faith and practices they had always revered. If there was no authority in the Bible for infant  U baptism,--and it was evident that there was not,--there could not be any proper authority for it outside the Bible. The Lord is the law-giver in the Gospel dispensation.   Dr. Eaton's Second Lecture.      479S What He has commanded must be observed; what He has not commanded it is not right to engraft on the super- structure which He himself left complete. These addenda      i to Christ's finished work are not only presumptuous, but sinful; and men who, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,--the triune God, perform that     l for which there is no divine authority, do wrong and teach wrong, and thus are the willing instruments in propagating  a fearful error, which has done perhaps more than any      ; other one thing to corrupt the religion of our Lord Jesus  Christ, and to lead men away from the gospel, subverting the order and the ordinances which Christ in His wisdom saw proper to institute and to leave on record. Infant baptism  supersedes entirely believers baptism, the only baptism that the Saviour enjoins, and places what men lo to unconscious babes in lieu of that which the Saviour !as- expressly commanded and enjoined upon all who )elieve in Him. The Baptist church-house was filled to its utmost capac- ty.  The intelligence of the city, of all denominations Was present. Men and women felt that they must know he truth; that it was their duty to themselves, to their umilies, to the community, that they ascertain beyond a oubt what the Bible required. Dr. Eaton was calm, dig- ified, but truly in earnest. He realized the responsibility 3 an embassador for Christ, that he teach just what, hrist had commanded, not, daring to add  to, or take om.   And whether men   would bear or whether they ould forbear, it was binding on him to proclaim and ,ge upon their consideration the whole counsel of God. He was fully conscious that it was not a popular move- ent to attack the  stronghold of prejudice and error. any would make war upon the right, if it opposed them,     480       Evangel Wiseman. and would fight valiantly even against their better con. victions, to maintain themselves in what is regarded by them as consistency. "We have found," remarked Dr. Eaton, after a solemn prayer for the aid and guidance of the Holy Spirit, that all present might be taught of God to walk in the ways of Christ's commands, " that there is no Scriptural authority for the rite termed by general consent infant baptism.  And perhaps we should be content to leave the subject just here; for we should all realize that what Christ has not commanded shall not be practiced as by His authority and in his 'name, whatever may be the views of men as to its expediency or benefits. But, as many who have had their minds aroused to the consideration of this subject will doubtless. ask, How could this rite have originated and why should it have been so long and so extensively practiced if not taught by the Saviour? it may not be amiss for me to give the best explanation .of its rise and progress afforded us by ecclesiastical history, that we may at least have the facts in the case; and then, whether we will allow our judgment and actions to be influenced by these facts. "We shall now consider the errors in doctrine, that first led the fathers of the Christian church to the great error in practice of infant baptism. "The first step was, the identification of the outward ordinance with the impartation of regenerating grace. When it came to be believed of baptism that it possessed regenerative power, that in the administration of this ordi- nance the soul was cleansed from sin, and translated into the kingdom of God, it required but one other step, and that one easy to be taken, to include infants in this great work of benevolence and salvation. Indeed, the argument   Dr. Eaton's Second Lecture.      481 was conclusive, after the introduction of the false pre- mises. "If baptism was the regenerative act, or the act through and by which- regenerating grace was bestowed, then all who were unbaptized were unregenerated, and conse- quently in an unsaved state;-'all baptized, in a regenerated or saved state. "This being believed and established as a fundamental doctrine, how necessary to include children-infants, of the earliest age! There could have been no stronger appeal to the mind of any parent to induce him to bring his infant to the baptismal font. What parent would dare to keep his child away? "We find the following words ascribed to Origen, one of the Fathers of the third century. We. shall show that previous to the very latter portion of the second century, or the beginning of the third, there is no reliable mention of the baptism of infants. Origen is thus quoted: 'None is free from pollution, though his life be but the length. of one day upon the earth. And it is for that reason, because by the sacrament of baptism, that the pollution of our birth is taken away, that infants are baptized.' And he adds, 'For this also it was, that the church had, from the Apostles, a tradition (or order) to give baptism even to infants. For they to whom divine mysteries were committed, knew that there is in all persons the natural pollution of sin, which must be done away by the water and the Spirit.' "If these words of Origen be reliable, my friends, we see, first, that he only claims tradition for his authority for infant sprinkling,- but urges it on the ground that, as the infant possesses original sin, which the sacrament of baptism could cleanse, it should therefore be baptized. 81 /     4IZ       1/vangel wzseman. "Cyprian argues thus: 'If then, the greatest offenders, and they that have grievously sinned against God before, have, when they afterward came to believe, forgiveness of their sins-and no person is kept off from baptism and the grace-how much less reason is there to refuse an infant, who, being newly born, has no sins,-save that having descended from Adam according to the flesh, he from his very birth, contracted; the contagion of the death and is really threatened-who comes for this reason to receive forgiveness of sins, because they are not his own, but others' sins, that are forgiven him.' "Basil testifies,.' Baptism is the soul regenerated.' ' Ambrose says, 'Who regenerated them of the water and of the Holy Spirit.' "Chrysostom: 'Baptism is the cleasing of the sins by the Holy Spirit.' "Augustine says: 'Baptism washes the body, and sig- nifies what is done in the soul.' "This doctrine of baptismal regeneration, repudiated by our Presbyterian friends, but still taught in the Prayer book of the Episcopal Church, if not believed in by all 'of their membership, and taught in precept and practice by all Roman Catholics, is that which first gave rise to the practice of infant baptism. When Melville was asked if he believed in baptismal regeneration, he replied, that as long as he held the common Prayer-book in his hand' and subscribed to its teachings, he must hold this doctrine as true. And a later writer, of less prominence it is true, but one who is supposed to reflect the belief on this subject of the organization of which he is a member, William Hodges, of Williamsburg, Virginia, says: 'It brings the child into the church of God, to which He has promised His favor and blessings; translates it from the        .   Dr. Eaton's Second Lecture.      483 kingdom of darkness into the visible kingdom of God's dear Son on earth. It secures to the child the prayers of God's people. It is no longer a stranger and foreigner, but a fellow-citizen with the, saints and household of God. It has sealed to it a personal share in the kingdom of God's grace. Its relations to God and to the world are changed by it. The child is in a certain sense born again-that is, put into an entirely new state of spiritual relation, and made an heir of a new inheritance.' "Here, my friends, we see the remnant of the old leaven, which led men to distrust Christ's ordinances, and wholly to pervert the order. He says, 'faith, and then baptism;' they say 'baptism first, and then faith.' "In the incipient stages of this mighty error, the idea still lingered that faith must precede the administration of the ordinance, and as children were incapable of exer- cising faith, sponsors, or persons who were supposed capable of doing so, stood and answered for the infant. "I will read you the ancient form for the initiation of a catechumen, and you who are familiar with the Episcopal baptismal service, will readily perceive the resemblance. Let me remark that these catechumens were always in-  structed in the doctrines of salvation, and on examination, answered for themselves. But after the introduction of baptizing infants, the babe being incapable of doing this, was answered for by his sponsor. "The first question asked by the officiator is:  "'Doest thou renounce the devil, and all his works, all his angels, and all his service and his pomps?' "Sponsor. ' I do renounce.' "Tllis question was asked and answered three times. "Officiator. 'Hast thou renounced the devil?' "Sponsor. ' I have renounced.'   .          .     484       -.vangel Wzseman. "O. ' Blow and spit upon him.' Which he does. The officiator then turns him around, holding his hands down, and saith to him: ' Art thou joined to Christ?' "S. 'I am joined.' "  O. 'Hast thou been joined unto Christ?' "S. 'I have been joined.' "O. 'Dost thou believe in Him?' "S. 'I believe in Him as the living God.' Then he repeats the creed. " . ' Worship him.' "S. (Bowing.) 'I worship the Father,' etc. etc. "Concludes with the blessing and prayer.* "We see by the time this formulary was introduced, that the second step had already been taken in establishing infant baptism, that is, the necessity of washing away original sin in ,the child. "Gregory Nazianzen says, (he had just given his opinion that it was better for children in good health to wait until they were three years old): 'Yet by reason of these sudden assaults of danger, that are by no endeavor to be prevented, it is by all means necessary that they be pre- vented by the laver-(of baptism)." "Augustine speaks thus: 'The power of the devil is really exercised upon infants and they can renounce it by / the heart and mouth of those who carry them to baptism, since they cannot by their own, by which they, delivered from the power of darkness, may be transferred into the 4 kingdom of God.' "Now, what is in them by which they are held in the devil's power until delivered by Christ's baptism? What but sin? But infants have committed no sin of their own * Rites and Ceremonies of th6 Greek Church in Russia. Dr. Jo Co King.   Dr. Eaton's Second- Lecture.     485 in their life. Hence, there remains original sin, by which they are captive under the power of the devil, if they are not delivered by the laver of regeneration and the blood of Christ, and pass into the kingdom of their Redeemer-the power of their jailor (Satan) being frus- trated, and ability being given them of becoming the children of God, who are the children of this world. "The next step was at hand-it could be taken without shaking the sensibilities of the advocates of infant bap- tism founded on the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. Indeed, if those who were baptized were saved, those who were not baptized were lost, and this fearful doctrine had but to be received to make infant baptism a fixed ordinance for the ages.  "Ambrose says on this point: 'For unless any one be born again of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. You see he excepts no person, not an infant, not one that is hindered by an unavoidable accident. But suppose that such have that freedom from punishment-which is not clear-yet I ques- tion whether they should have the honor of the kingdom.' "Another Father afirms: 'My meaning is, that as for infants who, by reason of. their age, are not yet able to speak, and others that are in any case of necessity, they ought to be received with all respect possible, lest it turn to the perdition of our own souls, if we deny the water of salvation to every one that stands in need, and they departing this life do lose their kingdom and their life.' "Augustine, in a letter to Jerome, writes: 'Whoever should affirm that infants which die without partaking of this sacrament shall be quickened in Christ, would  both go against the apostle's preaching, and also would      486       Evangel Wiseman.  condemn the whole Church. ..    .  .  I do not say that infants dying without the baptism of Christ will be punished with so great pain, so that it were better for them not to have been born, since our Lord spoke this not of all sinners, but of the most profligate and impious ones. . .  Our Lord will come to judge the qtick and the dead, and He will make two sides, the right and the left. To those on the left hand He will say, "Depart into everlasting fire," and to those on the right, "Come and receive the kingdom." He calls one the kingdom- the other condemnation of the devil. There is no middle place left where you can put infants. Thus I have explained to you what is the kingdom and what is ever- lasting fire, so that when you confess the infant will not be in the kingdom, you must acknowledge he will be in everlasting fire.' And again: 'There is no middle place, so that he that is not with Christ, must be with the devil. As nothing else is done for children in baptism but their being incorporated into the church-that is, connected with the body and members of Christ, it follows that when this is not done for them, they belong to perdition ... . If the child is not delivered from the power of the devil, but remains under it, why doest thou wonder, O Julian, that he who is not allowed to enter the kingdom of God, should be with the devil in eternal ire!" "Have we not, in the doctrines that I have fully quoted from the early fathers and those who favored infant bap- tism, suffcient cause for the origin of infant baptism and the propagation of the rite? "1st. I have shown from the Fathers themselves that they so far departed from the doctrine of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, as to ascribe it to the ordinance of baptism, teaching that those who were baptized were saved, and those who were not baptized were lost.

That these infants thus baptized and consequently regenerated were saved, while those who were not bap- tized were, in consequence of this neglect, turned into everlasting fire. Since the practice has been introduced, as there is no command in the Bible for it, it has become necessary to find authority, and various have been the con- clusions men have come to, some resting it on one thing, some on another; but no foundation has been laid for it that has not been overturned by some one of its own advocateso "How much better that men cast aside these traditions, and like little children come to Christ and learn of himl When the great Reformation was inaugurated by Luther, and that champion of truth came out in bold defense of the doctrine of salvation by faith and the order that Christ himself established, namely: faith, then baptism; it is ever to be regretted that he did not reject this error of infant baptism among the many errors he cast over- board. But retaining it, and still advocating the insepa- rable relation of faith to baptism, he was driven to assume the ridiculous and untenable ground that 'the children believe in baptism itself.' "Hear him plead this strange view: He says, 'There- fore, we here say and conclude that the children believe in baptism itself and have their own faith which God works in them, through the intercession and hearty offering of the sponsors in the faith of the Christian Church; and that is what we call the power of another's faith, not that any one can be saved through that, but that he i      488       Evangel Wiseman. thereby (that is through another's intercession and aid,) may obtain a faith of his own from  God by which he is saved. ....      ..   Their own faith in which they are baptized and believe for themselves.'* What confusion! what error! How pitiable the sight, to see the great mind of the Reformer engaged in such a manner as this, in the vain endeavor to support, as Scriptural, a rite man-made and meaningless in the great plan of redemption as revealed in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ  "Dr. Wall testifies thus with regard to this faith of infants: ' Some modern divines,' says he, 'especially of the Lutherans, have gone farther, and do maintain that infants have faith and do believe after a certain manner, but not in the same way and manner that adult people do, where faith comes by hearing, thought, meditation, understanding, etc., etc.; for they grant that infants have none of these. And What sort of faith it is that they have, cannot, as they confess, be explained.' "What fearful straits men are driven to, when they endeavor to foist on the churches of the Lord Jesus Christ, ordinances and observances which He neither enjoined nor taught! How far better to adhere to His requirements, recognizing that he was neither unable nor unmindful to provide and make plain all that his Divine wisdom saw fit, for the extension of his kingdom on the earth! Let us not be found doing 'wonderful works in His name,' lest at the great day of accounts He shall say unto us, 'Depart from me, I never knew you.' "Let us for a moment look at the distinctive reasons given by the various Pedo-Bapt-ist denominations for the *Walch's Works of Martin Luther, Vol. XI, pages 667, 672.   Dr. Eaton's Second Lecture.      489 practice of infant baptism. We take our extracts from their baptismal formulas. "The baptismal service of the Church of England and of the Episcopal churches of America, expressly teaches that baptism is for the regeneration of the soul of the infant, and its introduction into the body of Christ's Church. Bap- tismal regeneration is the doctrine they always teach. "The American Reformed Dutch Church teaches that 'Holy baptism witnesseth and revealeth unto us the washing away of our sins through Jesus Christ. Therefore we are baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' "The Presbyterian Church holds that this ordinance cis instituted by Christ; that it is the seal of the righteous- ness of faith; that the seed of the faithful have no less a light to this ordinance under the Gospel than the seed of Abraham to circumcision under the Old Testament; that Christ commanded all nations to be baptized; that He blessed little children, declaring that of such is the kingdom of heaven; that children are federally holy and therefore ought to be baptized; that we are by nature sinful, guilty and polluted, and have need of cleansing by the blood of Christ, and by the sanctifying influences of the Spirit of God.'  "We see that these two organizations, 'the Dutch Re- formed Church and the Presbyterian Church, hold baptism as a seal of the righteousness of faith. Episcopalians hold that it regenerates; the others, that because of regenera- tion, baptism should be administered as a seal: but neither one explains how or when the soul of the infant is regen- erated. "The Methodist Episcopal Church says, 'Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby  I     "O       Jvangel Wiseman. Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized, but it is also the sign of regeneration, or the new  birth. The baptism of young children is to be retained in the Church.'  "We perceive from this that our Methodist friends, as the Presbyterians, regard it as the sign of regeneration or the new birth." We have thus presented in bur discourses the baptism of the Apostles, the baptism of the Fathers, the baptism of the Reformers.

EALLY" said Miss Delia, after Dr. Eaton's second lecture, "I shall not go any more. He 'is so uninteresting-just as dry as a stick. For my part, I don't see how the people can pay such good attention to one that preaches of men who have lived thousands of years ago, and who must have been very ignorant any how." "These are the men, and this the authority, by which the friends of infant baptism prove it a church ordinance, as far as this is proved at all, aunty," replied Mr. Wise- man, looking up from his morning paper. "Well, I don't see what anybody wants with proof outside the Bible. I'm sure Mr. Nailom showed just as clearly as anything can be, that it was taught in the Old Testament and the New. It does seem to me some people are so blind. But then, it's the way of the world--folks see just what they want to see and nothing more. Don't you believe this is so, Mr. Wiseman?" she said, addressing the younger brother, who sat beside the center-table, look- ing at the pictures in the album. "Indeed I do, Miss Delia, think this is the case with some people," he answered, looking at her quite signifi- cantly." "Well, for my part the question is settled in my mind, and I don't intend that the Fathers, nor any one else, shall upset me. So long as it is in the Bible I am satisfied. I "!     "2      JEvangel Wiseman. know it is there, and that the church has practiced it in all ages, and this is enough for me." William Wiseman was about to reply, but on second thought he forebore. He fully understood Miss Delia's characteristics, and knew that an argument, however conclusive, would fail to convince her; so he smiled pleas- antly, and continued to turn the leaves of the album, while Miss Delia proceeded with the arrangement of the flower vases, and dusting the pictures. "Well, Major," said Mrs. Boswell, after Dr. Eaton's first lecture, " what do you now think of the covenant argu- ment?-rather an uncertain foundation to build a church ordinance upon, isn't it?" "Well, Annie, there is another side, I find; but then it's no use talking now, the children are baptized." "No, no, Major, you are. mistaken." The Major looked up in great surprise. "Why, nnie, what do you mean by such an assertion?" "I mean this, Major:  That because Dr. Peterson sprinkled some water on the faces of five little children, who do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, it is no proof that they are baptized, even if it was done in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. This is not baptism; cannot be baptism; because it is wanting in the proper subject-a believer in Jesus-and the proper mode-immersion  in water.  Our children are only sprinkled, and that, too, because Presbyterians follow thus far in the footsteps of the Roman Catholic Church, from whence they sprung, and which church, through fearful perversions of the word of God, instituted a rite, in itself meaningless and insufficient. Those who practice it do not agree as to its import or supposed benefits, and how   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.   493 sensible people, desiring to follow Christ, with the Bible in their hands, can be so duped by tradition and prejudice, I do not understand." The Major looked very thoughtful, but said nothing. His whole theory, founded on the covenant, was com- pletely upset, and he knew not where to take refuge. So, as the children were baptized, and his conscience relieved as regarded his duty, he was quite willing for his wife to have the strength of the argument on her side. We will here add, that never again was a Boswell sprinkled, and that as fast as the sprinkled ones grew up to account- ability, and made a profession of religion, they were bap- tized, and united with Dr. Eaton's church. The Major has not yet gone under the water, but in reply to the queries of his Presbyterian friends as to why he does not have the three younger children baptized, he always answers: 'Oh, don't say a word about that to me. Don't you know I have got a Baptist wife, and it's just as much as I can do to keep myself out of the water?" Ah, Major, you are convinced of your duty, but pride of family, and pride of consistency, keep you from humbly discharging it. "Well," said Billy Dodge, as he walked along beside his eldest sister, Sarah, "I, for one, am glad Mr. Nailom came  j here. He's given Dr. Eaton a chance to tell the people    \ the truth, and to show them there is no baby-sprinkling in the Bible. I always said there wasn't any there, but then I could'nt prove it, and folks said 'Hush up, Billy Dodge, you are nothing but a child, what do you know about this thing ' But I tell you what it is, Sis, Dr. Eaton showed them a thing or two to-night, did'nt he? Why, he tore Mr. Nailom's argument all to pieces. There's no     lvangel Wiseman.                     I use of baptizing babies anyhow. It can't do any good, and it must do harm, for Dr. Eaton said the Saviour told believers to be baptized, and when this was done to babies, and they afterwards believed, they never got baptized as Christ told them to." Hush, Billy, what do you know about baptism?" Little folks like you have no right to be talking on such subjects. They are beyond your comprehension." "Well, Sis, I reckon I can think for myself, and I tell you, Sis, as sure as you live, I'd never have any of my babies sprinkled, because it's not in the Bible." "Then you'll be a Baptist, Billy, will you?" said his sister, laughing heartily at Billy's earnestness. " I don't know about that. But it's certain and sure I'll never believe in baptizing babies. Im going to hear Dr. Eaton every night, if mudder'l let me. I like him, Sis, don't you?  He is so gentlemanly, and don't make the people laugh at his smart sayings. I think when we come to talk for God, we ought to be in earnest, and tell just what's in the Bible, and no more." Deacon Dodge was not so desirous that Billy should attend after he heard from Sarah the sentiments he enter- tained. But Billy was importunate, and at length the father consented he might go. He did not so well understand the Doctor's second lecture on baptismal regeneration, but he felt it was all right. So did a great many others present, among them Evangel Wiseman, who saw every stronghold of infant baptism sink into nothingness, when her mind was con- vinced there was no authority in the Bible for it-no duty in its practice, no benefit from its observance. Her mind was forever free fiom the last shackle of education and prejudice that had so long bound it. She could see the   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.   495   evil of perpetuating as a church rite, in the name of the triune God, that which was nowhere commanded, and of which no example was given in the Bible. She also saw and realized that unconscious babes were not saved by the gospel, that it was never intended for them, that its ordi- nances were in no way applicable to them; but that the blood of Christ made full atonement for them, and opened up a sure way to eternal life, for those who, not having sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgressions, in meeting the penalty of the law by the death of their bodies, were forever free, through the offering of Christ, from eternal death. Light and Faith had forever overcome Education and Prejudice, and she was free through the power of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus our Lord. "I need not, my friends," said Dr. Eaton, in rising to deliver his third lecture, " undertake to prolong this series of discourses. If the points involved in the question of infant baptism are all met and disposed of, it would be unwise in me to trespass on your time and patience, to introduce side issues that do not affect the subject under consideration, and which would not, if dwelt upon, throw any light upon it. Unlike Rev. Mr. Nailom, I am not paid for my work at so much per lecture. I have under- taken this investigation for the truth's sake, and the good of those who, with me, are endeavoring to find out the way the Lord Jesus has marked, that in humble obedience to his teachings, we may walk therein to the honor and glory of God, and the good of each other. "I think I have proved conclusively that there is no warrant whatever in the word of God for infant baptism. This done, the whole fabric, so far as it is a divine institu-      DV  Yt ,r VY o U,6o, Testimon tion, falls to the ground. If Christ has not commanded it, no one has a right to practice it in His name. That it is not in the commission He gave to his disciples where He teaches that those who believe--and only those-are to be baptized, is self-evident. No consistency of interpretation can place it there. That there is a separate and distinct command for it, its warmest friends have never claimed. I have, moreover, shown that it cannot properly be inferred from any of the texts usually quoted in its support, nor from any of the examples of baptism given as proof of it. If it is not in the Bible, it has no right in the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. as one of the ordinances of His house. Antiquity of error can never make it truth. "Furthermore, I have shown you how this rite origin- ated. We have found its beginning in the fearful perver- sion of the great fundamental doctrine of our holy religion -salvation through faith in Christ's atonement-and its progress in the further departure of Christians from this primary truth. "When men and women were made to believe that the ordinance of baptism possessed regenerative power, and that children were born with original sin, it required no logic to prove to their minds that children should be bap- tized. And when the other step in error was taken, namely: that those baptized were saved and those unbap- tized were lost, the practice must have become universal. What could hinder the parent who believed this from having his babe baptized at the earliest possible moment, even in the very first, if there was danger of death. In this, my friends, the Catholics are consistent. It is a, fearful error -an entire departure from the teachings of God's word; but accepting and teaching the fearfully false doctrine of baptismal regeneration as they do, they are consistent in   497   their deductions and practice.  Would that others who still cling to this unwarranted practice, were only as consistent as they. Then the advocates of believer's bap- tism would know just where to find them and how to meet them. " To-night I will prove to you, from Pedo-Baptist authorities, that there is no. mention of infant baptism in ecclesiastical history, as a practice, before the middle of the third century, and then it was practiced only in the North African Church; Cyprian having taught that it was a washing away of the universal sinfulness of human nature, and also connected it with the rite of circum- cision. "It is urged by our Pedo-Baptist controversialists, that mention of this rite is found in Irenmus, as early as A. D. 180.'- None, not even the most zealous advocate, has ever claimed any ecclesiastical authority earlier than this. I will read you the words of Irenaeus, and offer you the comments of Pedo-Baptist authorities on the passage--then leave you to judge for yourselves. He says: 'He-that is Christ-came to redeem all by him- self; all who through him are regenerated to God-infants, little children, boys, young men and old. Hence He passed through every age, and for the infants he became an infant, sanctifying the infants-among tle little children he became a little child.' "Now, let me ask you, my friends, candidly, if there is the least allusion to baptism in the phrase 'regenerated to God.' Are men regenerated to God in baptism? The -Bible nowhere teaches such a monstrous doctrine.  The church had not, in the time of Irenseus, gone so far from the truth as to teach it, and it is self-evident, that this father had no idea of such heterodoxy, and no one who       Evangel Wiseman.                   Tetimo desires to find the truth will ever dare to find infant bap. tism in this passage of Irenasus, because he says that 'Christ came to redeem all by himself, who through him are regenerated to God, infants, little children, boys, young men and old.' Ireneus expressly says, 'who through Him,' - not through baptism, -' are regenerated to God.' Baumgarten, Crusius, Winer, Reuler and Manscher, all German Pedo-Baptist authorities of high rank, deny that anything in Irenaeus proves the existence of infant baptism. One must be hard pressed, indeed, for authority, who can find it here. "The next authority relied on by our Pedo-Baptist friends, is that of Tertullian, who wrote about A. D. 200. But this Father evidently was not speaking of infants, but of growing children--the catechumeni; for he says, -I read his words: 'Let them first learn to feel their need of salvation, so that it may appear that we have given to those that wanted.' And again, ' They just know how to ask for salvation;' and ' Let them come and let them be instructed when they come, and when they understand Christianity let them profess themselves Christians.' It is evident that Tertullian cannot here be speaking of Infants, for how could they come and be instructed so as ~to understand Christianity? It is perfect nonsense to endeavor to make any intelligent man or woman of any belief, find infant baptism in the words of Tertullian. Neander, commenting on them, says 'Tertullian evidently means that children should be led to Christ by instructing them in Christianity, but that they should not receive bap- tism until, after having been sufficiently instructed, they are led from personal conviction and by their own free choice to seek for it with the sincere longing of the heart.'*  * Church History, Vol. I, p. 312. *Hahn's Theology, p. 55~6.   I   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.   499   " There is no trace of infant baptism in the first and second centuries. Is it not strange that 'He who is head over all things to the church,' should have left this rite in oblivion so long if it had been of His own institution? Is it not more than madness to suppose He would? No authority from Christ for it in the Bible; no practice of the Apostles to warrant it; no ecclesiastical history to prove its existence for two hundred years after the ascension of Christ. How dare men now practice it as a-Church ordi- nance? Surely their eyes are blinded by early education and prejudice, that they are not able to discern truth from error. But hear Pedo-Baptist authorities on this point. Dr. Barlow, Bishop of London, in a letter to Mr. Tombs, observes: ' I believe and know that there is neither precept nor example in Scripture for Pedo-Baptism, nor any just evidence for it, for about two hundred years after Christ. Sure I am that in the primitive times they were catechu- meni, then illuminati, or baptizati. The truth is, I do believe Pedo-Baptism, how or by whoia I know not, came into the world during the second century, and in the third or fourth began to be practiced, though not generally.' " Neander affirms that it cannot possibly be proved that infant baptism was practiced in the apostolic age. "Prof. Hahn, of Breslau, says:' Accordiig to its (bap- tism) true original design, it can be given only to adults who are capable of true knowledge, iepentance and faith. Neither in the Scriptures nor during the first hundred and fifty years is a sure example of infant baptism to be found, and we must concede that the numerous opposers of it cannot be contradicted on Gospel ground.* "Prof. Lange says: 'All attempts to make out infant       500       Evangel Wiseman. baptism from the New Testament fail. It is totally opposed to the spirit of the apostolic age and to the fundamental principles of the New Testament.* "Olshausen testifies: 'By the introduction of infant baptism, which was certainly not Apostolical, the relative position of baptism was changed t "Myers, in his commentary on Acts 16: 15, testifies 'that baptism without faith never appears, (in the Scrip- tures,) and is contrary to Matthew 28: 19 (the commission). The continued opposition to infant baptism would have been inexplicable if it had been an undoubted apostolical institution.' "Menzell writes: 'One of these abuses was infant bap- tism, a departure from the original form of the sacrament, which had existed for centuries in the Church, for which indeed very pertinent reasons can be offered, but it is nevertheless a departure.' "This bring us down to the third century. Hear Nean- der's testimony. He says: 'About the middle of the third century the theory arose, that without external baptism no one could be delivered from that inherent guilt-could be saved from the everlasting punishment that threatened him, or raised to eternal life. And when the notion of a magical influence or charm connected with the sacraments continually gained ground, the theory was finally evolved of the unconditional necessity of infant baptism. The only question that remained was, whether the child ought to be baptized immediately after its birth, or not till eight days after, as in the case of circumcision.' "Walafridus Strabo, who lived about the year seven hundred and fifty, is express on this point. He writes * Lange on Infant Baptism, p. 101. tOlshausen, vol. XI. p. 45.   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.   501 thus: 'It is to be noted that in the primitive times the grace of baptism was wont to be given to those only who were arrived to that maturity of body and mind, that they  could know and understand what were the benefits of bap- tism, what was to be conferred and believed, and in a word, what was to be observed of those that are regenerated in Christ.' "Suiceras tells us: 'In the two first ages, no person was baptized till he was instructed in the faith and tinctured with the doctrine of Christ and could testify his own faith, because of those words of Christ, " he that believeth and is baptized," therefore believing was first.' "Curcellceus is positive in the following language: 'Pedo-Baptism was not known in the world the two first     i ages after Christ. In the third and fourth it was approved of by a few. At length, in the fifth and following ages, it began to obtain in divers places. And therefore we observe this rite indeed as an ancient custom, but not as an apostolic tradition. The custom of baptizing infants did not begin before. the third age after Christ, and there appears not the least footstep of it in the two first cen- turies.' "Rheinwald says: 'Notwithstanding the recommendation of it by the Fathers, it never became a general ecclesiastical  institution till the age of Augustine.' Augustine lived and wrote in the third century. ' We shall look now at the state of this rite in the third century: "Origen writes in this century: 'Infants are baptized for the forgiveness of sins. Of what sins? Or when have they sinned? Or how can any reason of the laver in their case hold good but according to the sense that we men- tioned even now? None is free from pollution, though his /,,          ,I 9     5i02      Evangel Wiseman. life be but the length of one day upon the earth. And it is for that reason, because by the sacrament of baptism the pollution of our birth is taken away, that infants are baptized.' "Here we see, friends, that Origen finds the need of infant baptism in the necessity of washing away the ' pollution' of our birth,' or ' original sin.' Here was the efficacy of the ordinance as Origen regarded it. "And this is the true source from which infant baptism rose-the false idea that regeneration was dependent on baptism. Origen adds: 'For this also it was that the church had, from the Apostles, a tradition (or order) to give baptism even to infants. For they to whom divine mysteries were committed, know that there is in all persons the natural pollution of sin which must be done away by water and the Spirit, by reason of which the body itself is also called the body of sin.' "Neander observes, on these words of Origen: 'Iis words in that age cannot have much weight, for whatever was regarded as important, was alleged to be from the Apostles. Besides, many walls of partition intervened between this age and that of the Apostles, to intercept the view.' "Origen, you see, my friends, does not claim Scriptural authority. He speaks of it as a tradition (or order) from the Apostles. IHe guessed at this, or asserted it presump- tuously, for nowhere is such order to be found. "Cyprian, the other writer of this century, an African bishop, favors infant baptism, also infant communion, as did the Council of Carthage, called and presided over by him, which convened A. D, 248. We must bear in mind that this doctrine and practice of infant baptism and infant communion were confined to the North African   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.   503 Church, as Neander has shown. These practices are not heard of during this century; either in the Roman, Greek, or heretical churches, as they are denominated. The learned Grotius decides " that infant baptism was not universally held to be necessary, because in the Councils one finds no earlier mention of it thanin the Council of Carthage.' "Should our Pedo-Baptist friends decide to take Cy- prian's council decision as authority for infant baptism, they should also take his decision with regard to infant communion. "We are thus brought down, step by step, to the fourth and fifth centuries. Let us have their testimony in favor of this rite, which we have found connected with infant communion in the churches of North Africa, but nowhere else. 'Evil communications corrupt good manners,' and we find in the Greek Church, in 381, Gregory of Nazian- zen, Bishop of Constantinople, having caught the idea of the necessity of infant baptism because of original sin, from his neighors across the sea, speaking thus: 'But, say some of you, what is your opinion of infants who are not capable of judging either of the grace of baptism or the damage sustained by the want of it? Shall we baptize them too? By all means, if there be any apparent danger. For it were better they were sanctified without their knowing it, than that they should die without being sealed   ! and initiated. As for others, I give my opinion, that when they are three years of age or thereabouts (for then they     are able to hear and answer some of the mystical words, and although they do not fully understand, they may , receive impressions), they may be sanctified, both soul and body, by the great mystery of initiation.' We learn from this speech of Gregory, that the question of infant         504       Evangel Wiseman. baptism was unsettled as late as 381 after Christ, for in this oration he gives his opinion merely, as also his reasons for that opinion, never claiming either scriptural or apos- tolical authority. "The Emperor Theodosius was baptized in the thirty- fourth or fifth year of his age. Gregory himself was thirty when he was baptized, and Nectarius, his immediate suc- cessor, was not baptized until after he had been elected to succeed him on the archiepiscopal throne. The Emperor had been trained from his childhood in the Nicene faith, and Gregory was born while his father was a bishop. We must infer from these facts, that infant baptism, if known in theory in the Greek Church, was not the practice of that church. Gregory gives it as his opinion ' that infants, in case of danger of death, should be baptized, that they might be sanctified without their knowing it.' *"We here give an extract to show that infant baptism was not generally practiced in the churches, although it is evident it was fast gaining ground. It is from an oration of Basil, Bishop of Cesarea, delivered A. D. 375. He was addressing a conoregation. These are his words: ' Do you demur and lopiter and put it off? When you have been from a child catechised in the word, are you not acquainted with the truth? Having been always learning it, are you not yet come to the knowledge of it? A seeker all your life long! A considerer till you are oldl When will you be made a Christian? When shall we see you become one of us? Last year you were for staying until this year, and now you have a mind to stay till next. Take heed that by promising yourself a longer life you do notmiss of your life. You don't know what to-morrow may bring!' "This eloquent Bishop has left us a list of what he denominates traditions, such as 'the sign of the cross,'   Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.    505 the consecration of the baptismal water, the three immer. sions, the renunciation of the devil, the unction, etc., etc., but nowhere does he mention infant sprinkling, and' we conclude that he did not at all accept it, as even tradi- tional. "I have forborne comment," said Dr. Eaton, " letting the statements of Pedo-Baptist authorities tell the history of this rite, the authority of which we have under considera- tion, that all may see for themselves the testimony against its being apostolic or practiced during the first two cen- turies after Christ. "In an African Council, held at Mela, in Numidia, A. D. 416, over which Augustine himself presided, there were ordained twenty-seven declarations or ecclesiastical laws, one of which, against Baptists, reads thus: 'Also it is the pleasure of the bishops to order, that whosoever denieth that infants newly-born of their mothers are to be baptized, or saith that baptism is administered for the remission of their own sins, but not an account of original   . sin derived from  Adam, and to be expiated by the laver      i of regeneration, be accursed! ' "Here we find the first law in support of infant baptism is accompanied by a curse on those who dissent from the opinion expressed, "Augustine observes: 'Men are accustomed to ask, of what benefit is the sacrament of baptism to infants, since for the most part, after having received it, they die before knowing anything of it?  "Chrysostom   complained that 'most persons neglected to baptize their children.' "Jerome, in his Epistle ad I;actam, speaks of those who refused to give baptism to their children. "We have in the fourth century (A. D. 370) the first     Testimony of Ecclesiastical History.  507   record of the baptism of a child made in the world's his- tory. Others had doubtless been baptized, but we have no record earlier than this. "Galates, the son of the Emperor Valens, was dying, and his father had him baptized. Of what age the prince was at the time of his death, we have no means of know- ing. The cause of his being baptized was his dying con- dition, which conclusively proves that infant baptism was not the general practice. "The Bishop of Rome, St. Boniface, in the fifth century, proposed the following questions to Augustine. It is evi- dent that he did not understand the subject of infant baptism: "Suppose,' said Boniface in his queries, 'that I set before you an infant, and ask you whether, when he grows up, he will be a chaste man or a thief? Your answer doubtless will be, I cannot tell. And whether he in that infant age have any good or evil thoughts? you will say, I know not. Since you therefore dare not say anything either concerning his future behavior, or his present thoughts, what is the meaning that when they are brought to baptism, their parents, as sponsors for them, make answer and say to the inquiry "Does he believe in God?" they answer, "He does believe." I entreat you to give me a short answer to these questions, in such a manner as that you do not urge to me the presumption or the customari- ness of the thing, but give me the reason of the thing.' "From the fifth century to the present times babes have been the subject of baptism. On what authority, I think I have shown.  Let us sum up the evidence from ecclesiastical history. It stands thus: Infant baptism is first clearly alluded to by Origen in the third century. We first find it practice4   in the North African churches, the most corrupt portion of the church, of this corrupt age. We find it in the Greek church, admitted in case of danger of death, in the very latter years of the fourth century. In the fifth century, through the influence and energy of Augustine, it was quite prevalent, accompanied by infant communion. "It was founded on that dreadful error of baptismal regeneration, and wherever administered, has set aside the command of the Saviour, 'believe and be baptized.' "I leave this subject with you. Will you obey God or man?" It was a signal triumph for truth. Out of seeming evil had emanated great good. But for the visit of Mr. Nailom the Baptists would never have brought their views, and the refutation of the error of infant baptism so clearly before the people of Chester. Men's minds were convinced, and many who had gone to witness the failure of the Baptists to prove their position correct, came away believers in "believer's baptism." It was a death-blow to infant sprinkling, one it has never recovered from in Chester, where the -truths held by Baptists, once so obscure, are now known and influence a large proportion of the intel- ligent minds of the place.
