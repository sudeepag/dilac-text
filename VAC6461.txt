X THE 'DETERMNATION. "THE cause is a noble and a just one, my son, and if you havo decided you muust go, I will no longer oppose you." Thus spoke Mr. R. to his eldest son Clharles, a youth of nineteen years of age, as the two stood in consultation beneath a large elm- tree in front of their dwelling, in Jefferson county, Kentucky, near the city of Louisville. Charles R. was the eldest of a family of six children-four boys and two girls. Charles, or "C(harley,'? as he was familiarly called by his family and friends, was a fine exponent of true Kentucky character;-noble, impulsive, brave; quick to perceive the-right, ready to defend it. 'When, on the 15th of April, 1861, the dread voice of war echoed and re-echoed throughout the land, rousing the millions from their -peaceful pursuits into the wildest fury, fired with patriotic ardor, Charley besought his father to allow him to seize his gun and rush to the defence of the South. The father objected. His child was young, he was his eldest boy and greatly beloved; and, more- over, amid the rapid rush of dread events, which had so convulsed the nation, Mr. R., influenced by his life-long iove for the old Union, had not been able to decide satisfactorily to his own mind where the right rested.     6        RAIDS AND ROMANCE, But the fearful-unfoldings of the war policy of the administra- tion which took place between the date of Lincoln's "War Proc- lamation" and the time of which we write, had fully decided him in favor of the South; and although a man distinguished for his reticence and aversion to all unnecessary political discussions, he boldly avowed his position, and defended it by clear and logical argument, whenever it was attacked. And his opposition to his son's enlisting under the Southern banner was dictated by'his attachment to him, and not indifference to the cause. On the morning of the day of which we speak, Charley (as we shall continue to call him throughout this narrative) had gone into the city, as was his daily custom, to learn the news and procure the morning paper for the family. Passing along Green-street, in the vicinity of the Custom-house, he met young Fox, an olA friend of his, whom he had known for years.  Whby, I thought you were in Dixie Land, Amos," exclaimed Charley, in surprise, as the two encountered each other. "Silence, Charley, do not betray me," whispered the young man, as he slippedc his young friend's arm through his and turned into Third-street towards Broadway. The two walked quickly along, avoiding observation, until they reached the Commons out- side the city. Then seating themselves on the grass at the root of an -old beech-tree, which stood removed some paces from the public road, theltwo engaged in conversation. "Charley," said his friend to him, "I know you have from the beginning of this war been anxious to go South. Buckner is now in Kentucky, as you know, and every Southern man who can bear arms ought to join him. I have spoken to a great many of our acquaintances, and there is a number of young men now ready and only waiting for an opportunity to get through." "/ nd this is all that deters me," responded Charley, his whole ountenance expressive of the strong emotion that fired his breast. "I have been thinking over the matter for days, and once or twice I have spoken to father about it. You know he has always ob- jected to my going, because he thinks I am too young; but his opposition seems to be yielding. And I know, when he sees I am determined to go, he will consent. I shall make every thing ready, and the first opening that presents itself, I will go. But tell me, Amos, how did you get back, and what are they doing down at Bowling Green? We have had so many rumors here, no one knows what to believe."  "I came oni the cars to Elizabethtown. Being detained there   OF MORGAN AND BIS MEN.       r   7 a few days, I was caught by the blockade of the railroad, and had to take a buggy to come to the city." "But tell me, Amos, why did not General Buckner and his troops come to Louisville? Last week everybody expected him. Ladies kept themselves and children dressed and in readiness to leave at a moment's notice. Union men sent their money and silver-ware to Jeffersonville. Old Prentice, it is said, had all the valuables of his printing-office moved over the river, and he himself went over every night that he migt t be safe from Buckner and his men. The whole place was one scene of wild excitement, everybody appearing to have taken leave of their wits." "General Buckner would have taken possession of Muldrough's Hill, most assuredly, had it not been for an untoward accident on the railroad. I do not know whether he ever designed moving on Louisville."  "And what was this accident? Do tell me all you know, Amos, with regard to the Confederates coming into Kentucky. We know  nothing here." "c You must promise me secrecy, Charley. I do not know how long I may have to stay here. And should my name be known as connected with their movements, I would certainly be ar- rested." "Trust me, Amos, I will keep every thing most masonically," responded Charleyi drawing closer to the side of his friend. "I must begin back, in olrder fully to explain the whole matter, to you satisfactorily." "Do so. I wish to know every incident.?' "But wait a moment. Yonder is John Lawrence crossing the Common. Our old friend John, you remember  him. He has just returned from Yale, completely disgusted with the Yankees and every thing pertaining to them, and is longing to get South. Let me call him." "We can trust him?" "Oh, yes, thoroughly with us, and as true as steel." Charley rose, and advancing a few paces from the tree, beckqned- to the young Inan who was leisurely pursuing his way from the high-road across the open -grass-plot that intervened between it and the woodland to the left. His attention was arrested, and with quick step he advanced to the spot where Charley stood. The two approached the tree. Young Fox stepped forward and grasped the hand of his old friend, shaking it most cordially.' "I have not seen you for a long time, John,'" said he, as he con-         IERBAIDS AND ROMANCE tinued to hold his hand. "You have been living with the Yan- klees for the lastltwo or three years. How do you like them?" "Plague take them. IDon't talk to me about liking Yankees, Amos; I detest the whole narrow-minded, nigger-loving, thieving race. And if I could have my wish, J would send a bullet through the last one of them before sundown."  "You are ready to shoulder your gun against them then, are you?" "Yes, at any moment. But tell me, how is it you are here? I made inquiry for you only a few days back, and your brother told me you were South. How did you get through, and what are they all doing down there? General Buckner is at Bowling Green we know, and the boys are having a glorious time, we hear, but further than this we can learn nothing." "Amos will tell us all about it, John. He was just about to begin, when I discovered you passing across the common, and I begged of him to allow me to call you. I knew you would be so gratified to hear of Buckner's move into Kentucky, and his occu- pation of Bowling Green." The three seated themselves. Removed as they were from the road, there was no probability of intrusion or interruption. "All I tell you, boys, is to be kept secret. Our enemies must not be made aware of our most trivial movements. It is necessary to deceive them, for I tell you, boys, we have a great deal to do before we are ready to give them fight." The two readily acceded to his proposition, and the young man commenced his narrative. "On the 17th of this month, General Buckner, then at Camp 'Boone, dispatched Dick Wintersmith to Elizabethtown to seize all the cars and lochmotives that were concentrated at that point. He had previously written in cipher to Colonels Hardin Helm and' Reed, who resided in that town, to hold themselves in readiness to assist in such a movement, which would take place in a few days, as it-was necessary they sh9uld have rolling-stock to trans- port their troops rapidly into the State. Wintersmith proceeded in haste to Russellville, from which point he telegraphed Helm, 'All right. I will be up on next train.' "From Russellville he went to Bowling Green, where he made known the secret of his expedition to Dr. --, a true Southern man, with whom he left the'business of guarding the bridge over Barren river, which was to be done in such a manner as to avoid ll suspicion. It was necessary to use every precaution, for hai the Home Guard or Union men for a moment supposed what wa. !       .    OF MORGAN' AND HS MEN.        9 on hand, they would have torn up the tracks, or destroyed bridges, thereby frustrating the whole project. "Having made every arrangement for safety and success at this point that his limited time would permit, Wintersmith came on to Cave City. "Here, as you are aware, the trains pass each other. As the train bound for Bowling Green came up beside the up-train, Blanton Dunncan, who you know is an excitable man, rushed to the plat- form and called out to e know if Mitchell La Beet was on board, stating in a hurried nervous manner that twenty policemen from Louisville were in waiting at Elizabethtown to arrest him as soon as he should reach there. This, of course, was alarming intelli- gence to Major Wintersmith, who felt for a moment foiled in his undertaking. But being self-possessed, and of a, brave, daring nature, and fully realizing the importance of the work intrusted to him, he in a moment decided to call in the counsel and aid of several gentlemen, on board the cars, who he well knew were Southern, and would dare any thing to serve their cause. The few   ninutes allowed him to execute his purpose were actively employed in providing for guarding the road at all points where it was feared rails might be removed or bridges burned. ' With two or three friends on whom he could depend in any exigency, he pursued his way to Elizabethtown, not knowing but that he would be seized as soon as he should feach the depot, yet determined to risk his life in the accomplishment of his trust. Reaching Elizabethtown, and ascertaining that there was no such police force there, as Colonel 'Duncan had mentioned, hiis first inquiry was for Colonel Helm. To his bitter disappointment and deep chagrin he learned that that personage had left the town and set out with -his family on the morning train for Nashville, "At the depot he met Colonel Reed, who, with other had some down to meet him. "' And Helm is gone i' was his exclamation, as he seized Reed's hand. " Yes,' was the response.     X "' And what is ourprospect? No Union force here, I suppose?' he asked, hurriedly, of his friend. "L None.' "' Well, fhen,' added Wintersmith, 'we shall accomplish the work. Art you armed, Reed?   What we do must be done quickly. Ncq a moment to lose. And we must proceed quietly, also. Any alarm will ruin us.' I* 10        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "'ajor Wintersmith, accompanied. by his telegraph operator, whom he had brought with him from Nashville, and followed by young La Rue, a nephew of John L. Helm, rushed, without a mom'ent's delay, up stairs into the telegraph office, which was situated at the depot. The operator, scared out of his propriety by this sudden appearance in iis room of two armed men, and awed by their stern words and determined manner, made but little opposition, and with a few remonstrative remarks yielded up his position to the young man who came with Major Wintersmith, "'Dispatch to Louisville,' commanded the major, ' that the cars are off the- track. Nobody hurt. Will be in late this afternoon.' "The order was obeyed. The Yankee operator placed under guard, and the major, With the assistance of Colonel Reed, young La Rue, and others who readily joined his standard as soon as his object was known, proceeded, with' all possible energy, to seize all the locomotives and cars found in the place. One engineer positively refused to yield. "' We do not wish to hurt you, sir,' said Major Wintersmith to him in a tone which bespoke the decision of his heart, 'but we must have your locomotive and train, and it is useless for you to resist. We are armed, and determined to perform the work assigned us by our authorities.' "' Well, gentlemen,' replied the engineer, who was convinced of the propriety of acquiescence, 'I yield only to force, and I wish this distinctly understood.' "' Oh, certainly, sir,' replied the major, we compel you.' "' Will you give me a'certificate to this effect ' 'Assuredly, sir.' "Tie certificate was written, and the engineer withdrew, leavirg Major Winteremith and his friends in possession of the tain., "Tis was a most valuable acquisition-the locomotive being the finest on the road; and moreover the cars were laden with such provisions as the Confederate troops most needed." "Bravo, bravo!" shouted the two listeners, wild with the enthusiasm with which the major's success had inspired them. "Three cheers for Wintersmith and Reed!" "And I do hope," added young Lawrence, " that the Confeder- ates may get every pound of the vast stores that for weeks have been accumulating at Elizabethtown. Father has a large quantity of bacon and flour there, and, in his name, I bid Buckner and his brave followers a hearty welcome to it all. Three times three for I                    /   X .OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.       " the South!" he vociferated, as he took off his cap and waived it energetically in the air. '"May she triumph on every battle-field, and whip the Yankees to death in efery engagement. But resume your narrative, Fox." "As soon as Major Wintersmith had obtained full possession of all the rolling-stock, and so guarded it as to secure it against any attempt at recapture, he sent a locomotive and tender, with about twenty armed men, led by Colonel Reed and La Rue, towards the Junction, for the purpose of capturing the train from Lebanon to Louisville, and also the evening train from Louisville to Bowling Green. This undertaking was eminently successful in getting possession of both trains, but, unfortunately for the sortie, some wretch escaped from the train while it stood'at the Junction, and ran about half a mile in advance, and tore up the rails; and when the train came dashing along at full speed, a few minutes after- wards, the front passenger car was thrown off the track, and precipitated some thirty or forty feet down a precipice. The next car, strange to say, was detached and fell directly across the road. "This, as you may well imagine, was a fearful situation for the expeditionists. Some two or three locomotives, together with a freight and construction train were behind 4the fallen car. This must be removed and the road repaired before there was any possibility of advancing towards their destination. They were momentarily expecting an attack from the Home Guard of that region, who, they had been informed, were assembling to capture them. And, to add to their troubles, night was rapidly approach- ing and the rain began to fall heavily. "But nothing daunted, the boys, led by Colonel Reed, threw off-their coats and set about removing the car that blocked up the road. It was an arduous undertaking. They worked with right good-will, using fence-rails and whatever they could make available to expedite their work. The passengers, of whom none were kLilled, and only one man severely bruised, lent their assistance. They were mostly Southern men, and those who professed Union- ism were not so tenacious of their avowed principles as to prevent their participating in the novel and exciting work. But the task was a gigantic one, and it was near the morning before the car was hurled over the precipice to take position with its predecessor. This being at last done, it was the work of but a few minutes to replace the rails, bring back the locomotive, which had strangely leaped the gap and landed safely on the other side, attach it to the train, and drive at full speed to Elizabethtown. * \           ,          '   , i  12        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "Meanwhile Major Wintersmith' had placed the town under martial law, sent' out pickets and videttes, dispatched messengers to Bardstown and other points to collect together some companies which were in a state of partial organization, and bring theIn in, and made all necessary preparation to return to Bowlilpg Green, where he was to meet General Buckner and the troops from Camps Boone and Trousdale." "And what was the sum total of the expedition, Fox?" asked Charley. "The major and his friends must have gotten a rich booty."  "' They took eight good locomotives; among the number that superior one I mentioned, which is by far the best in the West, about two hundred cars, fifty of these being construction cars,--- which are so much needed at Bowling Green, an immense amount of provisions of all kinds, which will be most acceptable to Back- ner's army, and all this without the loss of one life." ( Capital!" exclaimed young Lawrence, springing to his feet, and again tossing upl his cap with cheers for Wintersmith and the Confederacy. "I heartily wish, boys, that they would come and take Louisville as easily."  "But tell us, Fox, why did not General ]uckner come to Louis- ville?"  "I am not sure that he designed the occtipation of our city. He wished, however, to possess Muldrough's Hill, and the day after he reached Bowling Green, he sent forward the Second Kentucky, Hanson's regiment, for this purpose. But, unfortunately, some vile Unionists had torn up the road, and the cars containing the men were precipitated from the track." "Anybody hurt?" interrupted Charley. "Not a man. It was really providential that nd life was lost. Before the road could be prepared, Rousseau had advanced, and thus General Buckner's designs were wholly frustrated." "How unfortunate l" exclaimed Charley.  "This city would have been On easy prey, and General Buckner and his men iwould have been hailed as deliverers, benefactors, by a large portion of the citizens. Now, I fear, it is too late-to6olate. Thesebhordes of blue-coated Abolitionists that daily pass through the streets, must necessarily impede his progress: I fear may prevent it altogether." " And this is why General Buckner did not come to Louisville," remarked -Lawrence. "' We could not tell why it was, but this explains it all. Rumor gave a thousand reasons, but you know   X(            OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         13 nothing can be credited in these days of falsehood and exaggera- tion."  "Do you think, Fox, that Buckner will comne soon?" asked Charley thoughtfully.  "Not soon."  "And why?" "Because of his want of men. He has but a small force, much less than persons suppose; but he is determined to remain in his present position. As to whether he will advance, that will depend entirely upon the reinforcements he shall receive and the force sent against him." i  "If he cannot come to us,. John, we will go to him. We should not remain idle hero while our cause is suffering for men to defend it. What say you, John, shall we not hazard every thing to reach - Buckner?"       ' "Yes, Charley, I shall go home and make arrangements to leave at the very earliest opportunity. t When do you go back, Fox?" "I leave to-night." "Could you not delay a few days in order to give Charley and me time to get ready?"                 ', "I am under promise, and have made all my arrangements to set out at ten to-night, otherwise I would wait for you with pleasure. But you will find opportunities for getting through. Young men are constantly leaving this portion of the State to join Buckner. There is a camp near Bloomfield, where whole companies have several times rendezvoused and gone through. Your safest way would be to go there. But list, what does that music mean?" "Another aboliti on regiment wending its way to the Nashville depot, no doubt," replied young Lawrence. "My blood grows hot as I think of their polluted feet desecrating the streets of our city. It is hard to bear thelight, boys. And yet, where is the remedy "     I "It can be found only in throwing ourselves against them, John, and driving them back to their own homes. We are subjugated Unless we can conquer." "True, true; there is no other hope. And I for one will risk my life for freedom." The three arose and walked towards the city. At the corner of Broadway and Third-street they separated, each to enter upon active preparations for joining the army at-Bowling Green. An hour afterwards, Charley And John encountered each other in front of the Gall House.  314        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "I shall leave to-morrow night, Lawrence. I have just seen young Ashmore, wh6 tells me that my only hope is to go through Bloomfield, as suggested by Fox. He sets out to-night." "I will go with you, Charley." "Meet me, then, to-morrow night, at the first toll-gate on the Bardstown pike. I shall be in the city again to-morrow, but for fear I may not see you, I now will make this agreement." "Very well." Charley made some necessary purchases, and without delay drove homeward. to     CHAPTER II. THE PARTING. As Charley reached the stile, he saw his father approaching the house through the lawn. Securing the horse, he hastened to meet him and unfold to him his purpose. The father was not surprised. For weeks he had observed the restless, thoughtful manner of his son, and had divinedethe cause. It had given him much anxious thought and many a heart-pang, for he was conscious the time was fast approaching when a final decision must be had. He could not forbid his son's going, yet he felt very averse at his im- mature age to yield him to the chances of a war which he already foresaw must be sanguinary and protracted. Therefore, when Charley broke his intentions to him, he en- deavored with all a father's yearning tenderness to dissuade him from his purpose. Charley listened to his father's arguments, but remained uncon- vinced.  "I must go, father, and go now. It will not do for me to del y longer," he replied, with fixed determination, to his father'sl o-I jections. "To remain at home while the Southern cause is callirig aloud for aid, would be disgrace, infamy. You yourself, father;l could not respect me, if I should hesitate, now that our own Ken: tucky is invaded by the dastard abolition foe." His face was flushed-his voice trembled with the depth of his motion-his dark hazel eye glowed with patriotic fire. Thle father gazed upon his son-the opposition yielded. The noble ardor of his boy had conquered him. The two passed into the house. The family were made ac- quainted with the young man's resolve. Witheringly the intelli- gence fell on the fond mother's heart. Like the fiery shaft that suddenly darts from the surcharged cloud, spreading death and desolation over the beautiful and glowing landscape, so came this terrible blow to sweep away in darkness and sadness every hope, every joy. She bowed her head in silence. No word escaped her lips, as she sat gazing on the smouldering embers in the grate.     16        R AIDS AND ROMANOE  '  How could she give her boy, her eldest-born, her well-beloved son to the horrid fate of war? Her heart stood still before the appalling picture. "Oh, my son!" she exclaimed, after a few minutes' thought, "I cannot let you go. It is more than I can bear. You are so young, so inexperienced. You cannot conceive of all you will have to undergo, even if you could get through safely. But this is impossible. Danger is on every side. The enemy is scattered on every hand, and the Home Guard, an undisciplined mob, are well armed and infest every town and cross-road. There is no way open for you." "I know it all, mother, and have fully considered all I shall have to undergo, but I would b rave all this and tenfold more to strike for the right. I must go, and that immediately. These dangers that you speak of increase every hour." "But how can you go, my son?. You cannot mak your way through the Federal lines. There is no way. We a e hemmed in on all sides." "There is a camp, mother, near Bloomfield, in Nelson county. I will make my way to it and get out with others. Men are con- stantly going to Buck er from this point." The mother could not give her consent. Neither could she further oppose the una terable purpose of her son. With that sad- ness which only a mother's heart can feel under a similar trial, she busied herself wit- the necessary preparation to secure a com- fortable outfit. Every thing was conducted quietly. Neighbors might betray, servants might tell tales.  "Lu," said Charley to his sister, who sat. beside him sewing away as fast as she could on some flannel under-garments for her brother, "you must go into the city to-morrow and bring out Mary Lawrence." "' But she will not come, Charley. You know John is going tp the army, too." "I will see Johd, and get him to come here with me. We will leave together." "Oh, dwell, that will answer finely. I should like to see John once more before he turns soldier. He used to be one of my great friends. But I have not met him since his stay among the Yankees. I might not admire him so much now." "He is not changed, Lu, only improved. You would be charmed with him. He is so agreeable, so noble, and so hand-  some."   XIl! OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.             17 "Ah, don't speak his praises too rapturously. It might revive the old flame. You know we used to play sweetheart when we were children." "Oh, yes, so you did, and who knows what may result from your meeting to-morrow? But you will bring Mary out, won't you? And get her, Lu, to go to Elrod's and have her aIthrotype taken for me. She will not refuse." "Very well. I shall do all I can to meet your requests." "Dear, kind sister you are," said Charley, throwing his arms around her neck and kissing her soft, white cheek. "I cannot go with you to-night, Charley," said his friend to him as they met the next day at Manderville's clothing-store. "And -why not, John?" asked Charley, surprised. "Mother is quite sick to-day. As soon as I told her last night of my arrangement to go out with you, she was seized with one of her old attacks, and Dr. Hardin told pa this morning that if I should persevere in my intention, it might cost her her life. You know she has a disease of the heart, and is likely to die at any moment: I feel that I can scarcely relinquish my undertaking. I have made every preparation. See that large package of goods there., Pa got me a complete outfit, and, moreover, has bought me a splendid horse from Bacon's. Bu{my duty to my mother, Charley, is beyond my duty to my country. And I feel that I must delay until I can gain her consent." "I regret this, John, deeply regret it. I But you have decided rightly. Good-by, my friend, time presses me. II hope we shall soon meet again, where, with the brave hearts of'the South, we can shoulder our arms in freedom's cause." They grasped each other's hands firmly, and with a hearty shake and a word of adieu the two friends parted. It was the sunset hour. Charley and Mary sat beside the open window, lookingout upon the still, quiet scene beyond. The lawn with its carpet of green, and shaded here and there. by clumps of grand old forest trees, spread put before them. Beyond it, in the distant horizonD was the dim hazy outline of the city. The rich mellow rays of the autumnal sun were flooding the westerA sky with radiant glory; such s we dream lights up the far away abode of the angels. It was a soft, sweet moment for love. The two young hearts sat there in silence, each pulsating with that fervent emotion.  "What an age of anxious bliss we often live in a few moments!"The hand of the dial has scarcely moved over the horoscope of time, but we have, in these few fle ting  18        RAIDS AND ROMANCE moments, added to our experience either of pleasure or pain, years of thought and feeling. Oh, these dashes of joy or of grief, how far adown our life-path they throw their gladness anc4 their gloom! Charley was first to break the silence. "You will not forget me, Mary, when I am gone? Years may pass before we meet again. Others will gather rourd you, and perhaps will strive to win your love. Will they succeed? The thought is madness to me. You know I loved you, Mary, when in our earliest years we used to go with the Sabbath-school to our holiday pic-nics, or in winter-time meet with our schoolmates in our childish parties. I have loved you always, ever. My af- fection for you has never known change. And could I feel now that yod could love another; that while I am away, an edile from my home and friends, you should cease to think of me, forget to love me-Oh, the thought is anguish-but I will not doubt you, Mary. You have ever been true, even when far away. Shall I not rely on your constancy in the future as I haveifound it in the past?"  Great tears stood in Mary's large blue eyes, as Charley's words of doubt fell on her ear. She felt that her heart was wronged even by a suspicion of her faithfulness. The pearly drops gathered and chased each other down her flushing cheeks. In a voice broken with emotion, she said:  I "How can you doubt me thus, Charley? You do me wrong to dream that I could ever forget you. I have always been true. When we were separated for months, you had never a reason to suppose for a moment that I ceased to remember you. Why should you feel so now that I am older, and have loved you longer?" "Oh, I do not doubt you, Mary," he answered, clasping the soft, dimpled hand in his, and pressing it to his lips. Pardon me if my language seemed to betray a thought of change in your af- fection. You know love is jealous, apprehensive." "Oh, do not say so, Charley; you pain my heart. Love should be without suspicion, trusting, confiding. I do not doubt you. I do not feel thati any dark-eyed daughter of Dixie could ever sup- plant Ine in youir love." "Never, never, Mary. In life and in death I shall prove faith- ful to you. And should I never return, should I fall unnoted, and nO friend be near to bear my dying words to you, rest assured that as now your image shall dwell 'n my heart, and naught but the dread hand of death shall ever wrest it from its shrine." Mary looked upon him in her artless beauty. Tears were streaan- I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         19 ing from her eyes, and her color came and went with the varying emotions of her heart. Never had she appeared to Charley half so lovely. Her darl auburn curls were thrown back from the full smooth brow, whose whiteness was that of the Parian mar-. ble. And from the liquid depths of those large beautiful eyes, fringed with their long silken lashes, and now suffused with tears, spoke out the true loving soul of woman in all its. ingenuous ten- derness and trust. She was about to break the silence that had succeeded Charley's impassioned avowal, when'a buggy drove to the stile, and a gentleman sprang hastqly from it, and throwing wide the gate entered the yard with a rdpid step. "Oh, it is John! My mother! my mother " exclaimed Mary, hastening to meet her brother. 'Her conjecture was but too true. Mrs. Lawrence had grown suddenly much worse, and Dr. Hardin had requested that'Mary, who was her mother's nurse in her attacks, should be sent for. In a few moments Mary was bonneted, ready to accompany her brother to the city. Charley waited for her in the hall I "The ambrotype, Mary. Did you not have it taken for me?" She drew the picture from her pocket, and handed it to him. As he received it he detained her hand a moment, and placed on it a beautiful diamond ring. "And yours, Charley-am I not to have it "  "Lu will give it you, Mary. I left it at the gallery to be fin- ished. Write me, Mary, when I am gone." She sweetly smiled assent, as she turned 'those soft speaking eyes up: to his. He led her to the stile, and kissing her burning cheek, assisted her into the buggy. The brother seated himself beside her. A look of love through the fast-falling tear-drops, answered by one which spoke far more eloquently than language could have done the deep passionate idolatry of Charley's soul, and the lov- ers parted to meet-when Ah, when? Night drew on. The busy preparations were completed. The best horse was saddled, and brought to the door. The mother's burdened heart was well-nigh breaking. The father passed through the house with a bewildered, distracted air, like one seeking some object which his mind does not fully comprehend. Lu was grave to sadness. Tenderly she loved her brother, and sadly her heart was grieved at the thought of his leaving hoime. 'But her youth- ful imagination clothed even her sorrows with the bright-hued tints of hope.

She could add no more. Her heart was too full for words. She could only weep as she held him in her arms. The father gave his blessing- "God be with you, Charley.

I Lu kissed him, weeping bitterly, as she threw her arms about his neck, while Lilly and Willie, the youngest-born, clung to him as if they would not let him go. It was a sad, solemn moment-- one when the heart forgets the past sorrows fo'r the present, and beats with fearful forebodings of the years to come.

THE soft stars of September studded the heavens, shedding a pale dreamy light over the still earth. The night air was chill. The evening breeze, which had now increased to a stiff north wind, swept southward from the river. But neither the chas- tened beauty of the one, nor the discomfort of the other, could serve to distract the thoughts of our young hero from the glowing visions that filled his mind. He was taking a look-out into the future, and with that hopefulness peculiar to the young, which all the accumulated experience of the world, taught in history, biog- raphy, homily, didactics, and the every-day life of all Who are growing old, cannot school, warn, or overcome, his earnest soul was crowningthat future with fame, honor, and enjoyment. All the wild and brilliant excitement of a soldier's life was before him, and his youg heart bounded with rapturous exultation as in imagination he dashed on through victorious conflict towards the goal of his hopes. Alas! poor, inexperienced boyl He was revelling amid the rainbow tints of fancy. He saw not the labored march, the tent- less bivouac, the gore of the battle-field, the loathsome prison- house. He thougLt not of the home he had left-; not of the kind , mother who was even then offering up a prayer for her'boy's safe- ty; not of the indulgent father, to whom the long night-watches were hours of restless, anxious fear; not of the loving sister whose tears of affection were then bedewing her sleepless pillow; aye, even the image of the dark-haired, gentle Mary was momen- tarily obscured by these dazzling phantoms of war. On and on he rcde, busy with his own inspiring thohghts. He met only a passing traveller on the journey. As day broke over the earth, weary and chilled he neared Bloomfield, where he expected to find Captain Jack Alien, with his men. He entered the town as the gray mists of morning were lifting themselves from the humid earth. As he approached the inn he saw crossing the highway two xmen, like himself, equipped for travel. He     22        RAIDS AND ROMANCE glanced at their horses. They were jaded, evidencing a long and rapid ride. Without hesitation, he spurred his horse to their side. "For Captain Allen's camp?" Startled, they looked at him-it was but for a momsnt, they seemed to understand his mission as if by intuition-and bowqd assent. "Where is it situated?" "We do not know," answered the elder of the two travellers, a man of forty years: of age, and whom we shall call Mr. Bryant, "nor have we dared to ask any one we have met." "You do not live in the vicinity, then, gentlemen?', "We have come from Franklin county since yesterday evening, avoiding, as far as we could, all public roads, lest we might perchance fall into the hands of the Home Guard. These- are dangerous times for Southern men to be travelling in the direction of Bowling Green. Have you no idea where th3 camp is?" None." Just then the travellers passed a house by. the road-side. The farmer was on the front porch. He looked for a moment at the strangers, stepped out and bowed, with a pleasant smile. Mr. Roberts had seen many such travellers in the last two weeks, and he full well understood their business. "He looks like a friend, gentlemen. I'll trust him," and Charley reined up in front of the stile. "We are seeking for Captain Jack Allen's camp, sir. Can you direct us to it?" "Captain Allen and his men have gone to Dixie, my friend- left night before last." "Is it possible for us to overtake them, sir?" interposed Mr. Bryant. L"We wish to go through, but fear to set out alone." "Have you no guide, gentlemen?" None, sir." "And do not know the country?" "Never have passed over a foot of the way." "Then, sir, it would be attended with great danger to go alone There is a regiment of Lincolnites at Lebanon, another at New Haven, and I am told the Home Guard beyond are constantly seizing every one whom they suspect of attempting to make their way to Buckner." "What shall we do?" asked Charley, starting from his seat. "I must get through if it cost me my life."   X   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.,         23 "You must all remain with me, gentlemen, for the present," responded Mr. Roberts. "There will be some recruits -here in a few days, I am told, a company of men from one of the adjoining counties. You can go through with them." "Is there no danger in doing this?" asked Mr. Bryant, hur- riedly.                    "None in the world, sir. We are all right in this region. You may go where you please, and say and .do what you please.- No -spies here in Dixie. Not a Lincoln man in the neighborhood." The men alighted, and at the kind invitation of their host seated themselves lefore a good smoking breakfast. - Our'young hero began'to realize that there were diiczulties in the path to glory. But he was not a whit daunted. Naturally brave and enduring, with a love for the novel and exciting, the new-found trouble but heightened his zest and increased the interest of the undertaking. He chatted pleasantly of the risks that must everywhere beset their way, and reiterated his purpose to achieve his object or perish in the attempt. It was soon ascertained he was from Louisville, and many were the questions asked by his new friends relative to the state of affairs in that noted city.  "How many troops have passed through Louisville, Mr. R., since Rousseau brought his 'Kentucky' regiment over from Jeffer- sonville!" asked the host, as with his guests he assembled around the bright wood fire in the best room of the house. "I happened to be in the city at the time this quasi-Kentucky regiment marched r through on their'way to Elizabethtown, and, really, if all of Lincoln's defenders are like that squad of jail-birds and wharf- rats, I think General Buckner can come to Louisville whenever he gets ready. They- can offer but poor opposition. Why, / tell you, gentlemen, there was scarcely a man in the regiment that could hold up his head." ' "Several regiments of Indianians have been sent forward since then to join Rousseau, and many of them were fine-looking men. They had the air of men who can and will fight. I fear, sir, General Buckner will have hard work to get to our city. Troops are now being sent forward daily." "Who is this Colonel Rousseau ." asked the younger of the two men, who had hitherto taken but little part in the conversation "He has bee'Si-g uring in Frankfort for the past few months, as a member of the legislature. I have met him there frequently, and have several times heard him speak. He-seems to me to be a  24        RAIDS AND ROMANCE coarse, vulgar man, devoid of honesty and of patriotism; destitute, indeed, of every thing but bombast and selfishness." "Why, sir," interposed Mr. Roberts, he was onel of the cap- tains in that distinguished Indiana regiment that ran so gloriously at B'uena Vista. You remember Jeff. Davis called out to his men to open their ranks and let the flying Hoosiers pass, and then huz- zaed, 'Comie on, my brave 'boys, let us retrieve the day.' The cowardly Hoosiers then vowed vengeance against Colonel Davis, and I suppose Rousseau thinks nbw is a fine time to pay off the old score; but, I trow, he will have hard Work to wipe out the disgrace of that day." "Do you know his stan ing in Louisville, Mr. R.?" interrogated the young man.  "He commands but little respect, I believe, sir. I have no per- sonal acquaintance with him. Indeed, I did not know of his pres- once in our city until his name: *as offered for the State senate. I have heard, since then, from those who knew his status at that time; that he was a pettifogger, noted for his impudence and coarseness; a hanger-on at the Police Court and around the Jail, making a penny wherever he could. If a low case was to be tried, Rousseau was sure to be connected with it; and would often, when engaged in a suit, delay trial from time to time, in order to extract money from his unfortunate opponent by way of compro- mise. I have heard it said he would suborn witnesses--creatures from the most wretched classes, whom he appeared to know well --and with these as his tools, together with his bluster and auda- city, would often sucdeed where a more honestland honorable man would have entirely failed." "But how was he elected to the State senate?-a man of such a character! Was it not a disgrace to his constituents?" inquired the young man, who appeared from some unknown reason to feel either a deep interest in Rousseau, or an eager curiosity to ascer- tain his past history. "There was a vacancy-in. the State senate, caused by the death of one of its members, and it became necessary to elect a man to fill the unexpired term. 'Rousseau offered himself; there wasno opponent. He was successful, and thus, for the first time in Ken-  tucky, he found himself in position. This occurred before the presidential election. The frequent called sessions of the legisla- ture, which became necessary from the distracted state of the country, and in which he has ever striven to make himself con- spicuous for loyalty,' have given him some notoriety. A few    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         25 months ago, he solicited a commission to raise a regiment. Of course he had no difficulty in obtaining it, as he was introduced to Lincoln as 'Captain Rousseau,' who had fought gallantly in the Mexican war, and who was now a State senator from Kentucky He bore, in addition to this, a letter of recommendation from old Prentice, with whom he is bosom fiiend at drinking saloons and wine parties. His zealous advocacy of 'The Government, as the imeaslires of the administration are now denominated, introduced him to the president as a fitting instrument to carry out his pur- poses ip bur State. With a colonel's commission in his pocket he returned to Louis- ville, and by ridding the cities of New Albany and Jeffersonville of the outcast and outlawed population, he has secured a force with which he hopes to add fresh laurels to his wreath in his pat- riotic endeavors to 'crush out this wicked rebellion.'"  "And this is 'Colonel' Rousseau's history, is it!" exclaimed Mr. Roberts; "and it is just as I expected, gentlemen. I have always understood his character was doubtful, but I had not known how mere circumstances had made him a hero, I tell you, sirs, that nine-tenths of these Kentucky Federal officers are of the same stamp 'with Rousseau-little men without one whit of merit- made great by the events of the hour, and-" A loud knock was heard at the door. Mr. Roberts arose to open it. As he did so, he encountered a man of medium height, dressed in a suit of dark jeans. Beside him was a youth of about twenty years of age. The strangers bowed, bidding him "Good- morning." "Walk in, gentlemen, walk in," said Mr. Roberts, throwing open the door and motioning them to the fire. Thqy stepped forward descried the three guests, and hesitated. Mr. R., divining their reason, whispered to them, "All right, no danger; these are friends." "I call, Mr. Roberts," said the elder of the two, before taking the proffered chair, "to ascertain where the rendezvous is in this neighborhood for Southern men, and whether there is any proba- bility of getting through to General Buckner from this point. I learned in Bloomfield that Captain Alien had left a few days since, but apprehensive that some difficulty might arise from further questioning on this subject, I did not make known to my inform. ant the object of my inquiry."     , Mr. oberts, in a few words, gave the desired information to the gentleman, and again requested them to be seated. They were 2     26.        RAIDS AND ROMNCE in the act of accepting his invitation, when another rap was heard at the door. The guests cast meaning glances at each other: sev- eral of them betrayed evident emotion. "' Do not be alarmed, sir'," said Mr. Roberts, pleasantly, observ- ing the trepidation of, some of his guests. "Friends, no doubt," and he opened the door and ushered in the three newly arrived strangers. Good-morning, Captain Utterback!" exclaimed the eldest of the three, a man of about forty years of age, with a very pleasant countenance, a noble form, and a slightsprinkle of gray mid his black hair, as he approached the fireside, and grasped the hand of one of the men who rose to welcome him I We have overtaken you at last, after a weary ride over a dreadful road." Captain Utterback, after greeting his friends, and introducing them to the gentlemen present, called kMr. Roberts aside. After a few moments' conversation with the host, he returned to the room, and announced to his men his readiness to leave. Charley and his two friends understanding that the captain was going out in search of Camp Secret, decided to accompany him and his men.      j "Any danger of betrayal from our num/bers, Mr. Roberts?" il - quired the captain.  "None, sir, none. You have no enemies in this region." The men mounted their horses and turned into the road. As they did so, they saw approaching them from the direction of the town a group of four horsemen, followed by a buggy containing an elderly gentleman and a servant; and yet a few paces in the rear, two others, whose horses looked jaded from travel, The party halted. Captain Utterback looked steadfastly at them for a moment. "For camp, gentlemen?" They answered in the affirmativel ' We are just setting out for that point," pleasantly remarked the captain, " and if you will receive our escort we shall be most happy to give it you." The offered favor was most gladly accepted, and the ien wheel- ed into line. Our young hero was excited and cheered with the animated prospect. Already had he taken position beside the young friend of the captain.  The party proceeded on the public road about two miles further m't west of Bloomfieldl then suddenly turning to the right of the high- i                                  , .  ;    [  '            '      *i.

As they were about to enter, they were accosted by armed men.  Who goes thelre?" ' . Friends of the South, " answered Captain Utterback. ' ": Pass in, and follow the road, it will lead you to camlp,'hwas the response of the guard. The horsemen entered. Proceeding a few hundred yards, they camre suddenly upon a large hollow, studded with small rail-pens, which were covered with straw. "This is ' Camp Secret,' boys1" said the captain, lifting his hat, and giving three cheers for the South. His example was lustily'followed by the men, who made the old woods ring again with their shouts. A few moments more, and Charley and his friends found themselves " in camp," for the first time. They saw there a few armed men, whose business it was to guard the place. There were new arrivals throughout the day, of groups of two and three, sometimes more. Some were on horseback, some on foot, others in buggies. By evening, the camp presented a very animated scene; new acquaintances were maude, adventures related, jokes passed-vengeance against the Lincolnites sworn by all. Baskets of nice, warm dinner mysteriously appeared in their midst. No one asked whence they came. It was enough to find them there, with their inviting contents, ready to appease the /quickened appetites. The viands were spread and partaken of with right good zest; toasts were drank to the downfall of the Yankees and the success of the South. "'Sleeping apartments" were selected for the night, straw couches arranged, with their covering of blankets and overcoats, and pillows of saddle-bags and carpet-sacks. "Why, how do you do, Mr. Simrall B" said Charley, as a solo ]horseman rode through the guard, and approached where he was standing beside young Wickliffe, of Bardstown, the two engaged in earnest conversation. "Why, how do you do, Charley? I did not expect to find you here. On your way to Dixie, I suppose." "Yes, sir; going out to fight for the South. Will you not join our company, Mr. Simrall?"  "Oh, yes, Charley. I have set my face towards the Sunny South, to link my destiny with hers, whether it be for weal or fbr WOeI     28        RAIDS AND ROMANCE It Mr. Simrall dismounted, and leading his horse some paces from  '  where the two young men were resting, secured him to a small    . ash-tree, then approaching a group of men who were standing in the inclosure formed by rail-pens, he made some inquiries relative -- to the preparations necessary for the night, and the probable stay of the men at "Caamp Secret."  An hour afterwards, as Charley and ytoung Wickliffe, who already found each other agreeable companions, were seated on an old log talking over the prospects before them, which 'spread out in fair enchanting colors to their youthful and now highly excited imagination, they obse:ved four horsemen dash into camp. One was slightly in advance of the others. He was about medium height, well-formed, and, sat his horse with an elegance , not often equalled even by the best riders. Every feature of his : face bespoke daring and, determination. His! mustache, was trimmed with exquisite precisionD  The suit of dark jeans was fitted to his handsome form, and the iinmaculate shirt collar, turned over the narrow black neck-tie, contrasted well with the  . bosom of dark flannel.  As he rode forward to the group he lifted his hat, and spoke.  There was manly dignity, combined with graceful ease, in athe movement. His manner fixed the, attention of oui young hero,    l who felt, he scarce knew why, an irlresistible impulse to move forward towards the, sttanger. He did so, followed by Mr. Simrall and young Wickliffe. On approaching nearer, Mr. Wickliffe recognized the stranger--  it was JOHN H. MORGAN, OF LEXINGTON.    OF MORGAN AND iIS MEN          29       I CIIAPTEPt IV. FIRST CAPTURES. VERY soon after the arrival of Captain Morgan and his men in camp, young Wickliffe took him aside, and the two engaged for some minutes in earnest conversation. 1"An excellent idea, Mr. Wickliffe. The men will then all be well armed, and we will be more likely to cut our way through if attacked. You are familiar with the cross route, and will lead the expedition?" "t Know every foot of the road, Captain Morgan. Have travelled it many a time wen   was a boy,after rabbits and squirrels, and nothing would please me better than to capture ;he Home Guard  dastardly wretch s! and give them safe lodgment in 'Camp Secret' for a few .ays. It would dissipate their patriotism, I tell you, sir."  Several others, among them Captain Utterback, Basil Duke and Curd, who had accompanied Morgan fron L'exington, and Captain Miner, were called, and the matter laid before them. The plan was highly approved by them all; and another expedition, for a similar purpose; was set on foot, to be carried out by the Anderson county boys, headed by Duke and Curd. Twenty-five men were chosen for the dash upon Lawrenceburg, and thirty-five to accompany Crisp Wickliffe, the latter undertaking being regarded as far more hazardous. ' Among this number was Charley, who \ was eager for au' adventure. o Every thing was as speedily and quietly arranged as it was possible.. A strong'spring wagon, which Captain Morgan's men had brought through from Lexington, was detailed for the enter- prise to Bardstown to bring into camp the captured guns. The expedition to Lawrenceburg was to go unarmed, with the excep- tion of a few good markslen, and the men were to bring their trophies with them. Duke .and his men set out as soon as the darkness of the night veiled their mQvemeits. About an hour and a half later, young   , . .% 30        RAIDS AND ROMANCE Wickliffe, with his thirty-five followers, armed to the teeth, left , the camp and struck out into the country. On and on they went,  :i through farms and lanes,as faist as the rough nature of the road would allow, uptil they reached the turnpike leading into the town, i . a quarter of a mile from the place. It was midnight, and as dark as Erebus. No moon gave her light, and the stars were shut ill n by heavy black clouds. Not a sound was heard save that made by the tramping horsemen. l"We must be as noiseless as the tomb," said young Wickliffetto  Cilarley, who rode beside him. Every thing must be done with the utmost quiet, for if we are betrayed in this matter we shall'be. captured after wle set out from Camp Secret." They proceeded in groups of fouIr or five on the grass-gro vn paths by the roadside- the wagon keeping a respectful distance in  the rear-until they reached the edge of the town.  The men were then h alted and Crisp Wickliffe, with two others, dismounted and set ofit to reconnoitre. They proceeded very cautiously to Ithe guard-house, where were deposited about lone , hundred Lincoln guns, which had been clandestinely introduced   ^ into thie State.  I                       : ' "Who goes there?'" called out the drowsy watchman, as the sound of approaching footsteps roused him from his unquiet slumbers. No answer was made. The men advanced.   I  "Halt! IWho are you?" cried the alarmed sentinel, a; he seized his gun and presented it. "A friend," answered Wickliffe, disguising his voice. "I colne with a command." The sentinel lowered his gun. Its clash on the pavement     defined its position. Quick as thought young Wickliffe seized it, , ^ while' his companions took the man in charge.          ,. "Not a word, or your life pays the forfeit." ihe fellow hushled  his breathing as he felt the muzzle of the pistol at his head. "Now tell me," demanded Wickliffe of his quaking prisoner, "how many guns are here, and how I can get them."        , The information was readily given, the man feeli g that thereby lie might purchase his life.  4 ,               'J, The three, with their prisoner, returned to the men.

A loud huzza went up as they rode in' withl their trophies. Young Wickliffe and his men were all heroes, and many a mess was enlivened that morning with ai recital of their adventures. Thle expedition to Lawrenceburg was equally successful, and in a little while the Whole camp rang out in loud welcome as Duke's party entered, laden-with their spoils. Each man had two, and someras many as three guns, the result of their daring. They had, captured sixty-five pieces, and the little camp found itself in pos- session of arms enough for all its unarmed men, and some to spare. Thus handsomely equipped, and each fearing that every noment's delay added to the hazard of the task before them, it was decided to make immediate arrangements for setting out to oin Buckner. After a few minutes' consultation, it was unani- nously agreed, by both soldiers and civilians, that John H. Morgan  should lead the expedition. The position was accorded, as if by ntuition, to the young and gallant captain, and, the promptness )f his acceptance, and the ease with which he at once assumed ,he responsible position, gave evidence that he was "born to com- nand." Throughout the day recruits were constantly coming in, intil the number in camp was augmented to four hundred. Captain Morgan decided to set out that evening, about sundown, travel "i night, and rest in some secluded spot through the next day, if it should be found impracticable to proceed on their journey. During the day, a Louisville journal was brought into camp by L friend from Bloomfield. The men gathered round to hear it read. They had been for two days shut in from the stirring events of the seething world without. "List, boys," called out Mr. Leach, as his eye ran down the news column, "Here is a striking morsel of intelligence for L1S.  Pausing a moment for ithe noise of merriment to subside, he ele- vated his voice to its highest tone, and with great gravity read the following announcement in Prentice's own words: "CAPTURE OF JOHN MORGAN.--John Morgan, captain of a lit- tle secession company at Lexington, Ky., with hip. mtn was cap- tured by the Home Guard, on their way to Dixie, in search of their rights.

IT was four o'clock in the evening of the 28th of September, 1861. The busy preparations for the march, which throughout the day had occupied the camp, were over. And the force which for four-days had been quietly assembling at L"Camp Secret," were in line, ready to move. They were about four hundred strong. two-thirds of the number were mounted, the remainder on foot. But all were well armed. And there they stood, a band of noble patriots, headed by their brave and daring captain. They were leaving home and friends-- all that made life dear to them-to espouse a cause which the pop- ular voice pronounced infamous and hopeless. Branded as traitors by the Legislature of their own State, frowned upon by public sen- timent-doomed, in the event of failure, to the felon's cell-no roll of drum or stirring fife to nerve their hearts to martial deeds-- no waving flag presented amid the cheers and loud acclaim of an excited multitude, to lead them on to glorious victory-no "God speeds" rung out on the tumultuous air from friends and fellow- countrymen-naught, naughlt, save the blessing and tears of kindly sympathy of the few females of the neighborhood, who had gath- ered to witness their departure. ' Their pathway was beset with direst danger. An armed foe before and around them, vigilant for their capture-a country to pass through almost impracticable to travel-no prospect of pay, rations, or clothing--the cause they sought feeble, struggling appa- rently hopeless--what had these men to nerve them to the un- dertaking? Simply this i heaven-bestowed motive: they believed they were right-their cause just; and thus believing, they could do and dare, suffer andi die, rather than be crushed beneath the fragments of a broken Constitution, rent by the hand of a vulgar despot. Say you such men can be conquered? It is impossible. Fanat- icism and fiendishness may hurl their wild and lawless hordes of ' 1     34        RAIDS AND  ROaNE               : -ANC armed minions against them, but they will be scattered, blasted; :,;; and, like the mighty hosts of Egypt's proud monarch, perish in ' OAF? their heaven-doomed undertaking.  -::- The word of comrnand was given, 'L Forward, march!" A gen-  ': eral movement followed the command, and from the infantry a  voice rang out in notes sweet and clear,             ; "c Cheer, boys, cheer; we march away to battle." Voice after voice caught up the measure, until throughout the  ; ranks there peeled one loud, harmonious strain. Handkerchiefs were waved in response from the group of weeping females, and silent prayers offered there for their success have found answer in a hundred victorious conflicts since. - Slowly they crossed the silvery stream that bounded their camp in front. Casting one look of parting on this rendezvous of patri- otism, they defiled into the narrow lane that led into the main road. As the strains of the chorus died out, a voice caught up the  :  words,                             , , "Though to our homes we never may return, Ne'er clasp again our loved ones to our arms, O'er our lone grave somr faithful heart will mourn: Then cheer, boys, cheer; such death hath no alarms."  . In buggies and on horseback, in the rear of this band of true- s hearted men, followed a number of citizens. Doomed for opinion's sake, by the tyrant at Washington, seconded by the treacherous  : sycophants of their own State, they were going out in sadness ?,. fromn the bosom of their families, preferring the sorrows of exile to. the horrors of imprisonment, or the ignominy of a base oath extorted from them by cruel violence. Many a manly heart heaved with deep emotion, and many an   -:: eye all unused to weep was bedewed with tears as the thoughts of home, with its helpless inmates, soon to be the prey of a base foe, rose up before the mind of the father and brother. Did' not the pitying eye of the Lord Jehovah look down upon this brave  : band of patriots, and have not the wrongs these freemen then  :; endured come uuBefore Him in remembrance, when defeat and    i panic and route have overtaken the insolent oppressor?  Pickets had been thrown out on the Bardstown pike six miles - ahead. The intervening country was friendly, and as the column i moved on by the few farm-houses that stood on their route, sunny-   O1F MORGAN AND HS, MEN.        35 faced children, with smiling matrons, waved them a blessing, and  loudly cheered for "Jeff. Davis and Buckner." The column neared the Bardstown turnpike. It was expected that an encounter would take place with the Home Guard at this point. But when Captain Morgan reached the road, he found it in possession of his pickets, who reported the way entirely clear. Falling into this road, they proceeded about a quarter of a mile, then suddenly debouched to, the right, and entered upon what is-. known as the New Hope road. The folds of night gathered over them as they took up their line-of march along this rough, broken. route; and, enveloped in the darkness of a starless night, they felt secure from all danger of the enemy.     36        RAIDS AND ROMANCE              !  - CHAPTER VI.  THE FIRST NIGHT'S TRAVEL.'  As we lhave said, it was rayless darkness. Thick clouds covered the face of the heavens. The country was hilly, and, at every Ad step of advance, the road grew more difficult. It was hard, rough  work for these men, all unused to midnight, marching. But their guide--"Kit Carson," as he had dubbed himself-knew every step of the way, was fully acquainted with every turn, hill, and stream, . X and every point likely to be occupie3 by the Home Guard, and under his, direction the column moved safely on. Captain Morgan was , untiring in his endeavors to avoid difficulties and cheer the men, frequently passing along the entire lines to see that all was right. i. Charley had found a very- agreeable companionf in Wood, of Nelson county, and the two youthful heroes whiled away the dark  and chill night hours in hopeful lookouts into their future, and ... scathing comments on a perjured administration, which, under  i the name of " the best government in the world," was rapidly !I!! sweeping away every bulwark of liberty.  -  The road, which 'was scarcely more than a bridle-path, lined on either side by thick underbrush, interspersed with gigantic \ i trees, was, in many parts, almost impassable. It was difficult for the mounted men. Those on foot often lost their way and strag- gled into the brush, while a buggy unfortunately veering to the  right or left found itself suddenly brought to a stand-still by a tree ' or a clump of scraggy black-jacks, and the only alternative was for the footmen to lift the vehicle back into the narrow road. Then the way to the main road had to be felt, and there was no g X range in which to-turn.   -                 !I There was a man of the party endeavoring to take through a lot of twenty-five mules. When day dawned, he found himself  ; X with only three of the pesky creatulres left  There was an old man in company, Mrl Johnson, of Arkansasn who afforded great amusement to those in his immediate vicinity. He had been spending the summer in Kentucky, and delaying too  ?!ljd   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         37 long, had been caught by the blockade of the railroad, and was driven to seek his home by this dreadful route. The old gentle- man wasi out of health, impatient, and Jwicke].   I He was driven by his servant-man, Bob, a boy the old man prized highly. Bob knew his master's peculiarities, and how to humor his fits of passion. As the difficulties ,increased, the old man grew more and more excited, then petulant, and then, unable to restrain-his wrath longer, he burst forth into a most furious invective against all living flesh. Just at this juncture the horse made a misstep, the buggy struck a tremendous rock, the old man was unseated, and ad not Bob caught him, he would have been dashed headlong from the vehicle. "I wish to God Jeff. Davis, Abe Lincoln, all the cussed politi- cians-yes, and the whole world, was miles deep in hell," he ex- claitned in the very fulness of his phrensy. "' O}, my dear sir, don't, I beseech you, place us in that horrid region," called out his fellow-traveller, in advance, higlly amused at the fidgety old Southerner.' 'I have left a wife and children in Louisville, sir, and I do hope they will be spared this dreadful fate." The old man could not be appeased. He continued to pour anathema-maranathas on all creation. About midnight, Captain Morgan rode along the lines, announ- cing the approach to the Rolling Fork, a deep, and rocky stream, the passage of which would be attended with delay, perhaps with difficulty and dllnger. When old Mr. Johnson heard this, he seized the reins,.drew himself up to the fullest height, and "swore he would never die content until every man who had brought about this cussed state of affairs had had his head taken off smack and smnooth." "Now, Bob, I tell you, boy," he said most emphatically, as he handed Bob the lines, "if you do drown me, Bob, I'll shoot you-- Do you hear mne, Bob? Hold your reins tight, and follow close to  that buggy."  "Yes, sar-yes, sar, master: I'll take you thr'ough safe, sar. If anybody can git you through, Bob can. Don't'ibe skeered, mas- ter; I'll git you through, sar."      t The Rolling Fork is a branch of 'old Salt Riv r'-as it is gen- erally called-that stream so famed in Kentucky's annals, of which poets have sung and politicians jetted. The "Fork" is a deep and fearful current, aneat the point , \    38        RlAIDS AND ROMANCE where the column had to cross it, a high hill rises abruptly on the southern bank. Lights had been placed by friendly hands on each side of the stream to guide the men in their passage. The blazing - pine-knots threw a vivid glare over the dark and sullen waters,  and gave the outline of the frowning hill in front.  "'Halt!' rang out through the lines. Footmen were ordered to X mount behind the mien onl horseback, that there might be no un- necessary delay. Captain Morgan rode to the rear to see that all  was in readiness. Gaining the front, he ordered the guide to ad-  vance. Kit Carson plunged into the stream and reached the op- posite bank. Captain Morgan and Lieutenant Duke followed.  "Advance!" and horseman following horseman dashed in and crossed over. Now came the buggies. Captain Morgan returned to the middle of the stream and remained there to direct their  movements. At last old Mr. Johnson's time came. With fierce and loud imprecations he essayed to follow. Midway the stream, his horse  losing his footing, plunged furiously.           ' ' Oh! my God! I'm gone! I'im gone! Bob, if I am drowned  I'll have you hung. Do you hear that, boy? Hold that horse, or we'll be at the bottom of this cussed creek in a minute. A loud peal of laughter rang from the shore as the old man,  with these last words on his lips, emerged weezing and puffing from the " cussed creek."  The road was so steep and rocky that hoises had to be taken from the provision-wagons, and the wagons lifted by the men to the brow of the hill. Bob, with the assistance of others, succeeded in getting his master ove all immediate difficulties, the old man screaming out all the time, "Now, Bob, if you do kill me, I'll have you hung, boy. Do you hear that, Bob?"  The road was worse now than ever. They had struck a spur of the ridge, of which Muldrough's Hill is the most noted. On  they went as fast as the nature of the route would admit, nothing of interest occurring until about three o'clock in the morning, when Captain Morgan dashed along the lines bidding the men to be silent-not to speak above a whisper, as it was feared they were in the neighborhood of some Home Guard pickets.  I  The column was halted, scouts were thrown in advance, headed by Captain Morgan and led by Kit Carson. After a hasty reconnoissance, they returned and reported "No danger.' The way was now supposed clear of all obstacles, and, as the road improved, they quickened their pace.    OF MOEGAN AND HS 'EN.         39 At daylight they crossed the Lebanon branch of the railroad. It was expected to have a skirmish here with the Guard, who had captured six of Captain Jack Allen's company at this point a few days before. But not a soul was seen up and down the road as far as the eye could rlch In three hours mo hey were in the neighborhood of fiiends, wherle they halted to resh themselves and feed their horses. It was found that three 1i were missing from their number. What befell them could nev9 Ue ascertained. The party was now be- yond the enemny's lines. That night they encamped near Hodgenville, in La Rue County. As this was a hostile section, they found great difficulty in pro- curing food for themselves and horses. They succeeded in pur-. chasing some corn-bread and meat, which, added to their stock on hand, served to stay their appetite for the night. Early the next morning (Monday) they set out for the Confeder- ate encampment on Green river, opposite Mumfordsville. And as they felt themselves freed from all apprehensions of attack, each one breathed more freely, and joke and laugh resounded along those ranks of weary yet determined men. \ Not knowing but that a force of the enemy might endeavor to capture him in the vicinity of Green river, Captain Morgan very wisely sent forward viqettes to see that the route was clear. It had become known in the encampment that Morgan and his men would reach the river that evening, and it hid leen decided to send out an escort to conduct them in. Accordingly, Major Wintersmith, with two others, crossed the river and proceeded a few miles in the direction of the (expected advance. They had rode but a short distance, before they perceived two men ap- proaching theni. They were well mounted, and their guns were carelessly depending from their shoulder.    . "Halt!" cried out the major, as soon is he was sufficiently near to make himself heard.  The. men thus accosted reined in their horses, dropped their bridles, seized their guns, and in the twinkling of an eye were ready to fire upon their supposed enemy. "Friends!" cried out the major, just in time to save himself and companion from the unerring bullet of the riflemen. "We come to meet Captain Morgan."  Instantly the guns were lowered, and the two rode forward. A moment more and the parties had alighted, hands were grasped a friendly greeting, ind welcomes extended in the name of the     40        RAIDS AND ROMANCE Second Kentucky--Colonel Hanson's noted regiment-to Captain Morgan and his brave followers. An hour more and the whole force had crossed the river, and in a style at once dashing and impressive, rode into camp. Loud and long and pealing were the shouts of welcome sent up  by the Kentucky boys, as they beheld this large reinforcement to their numbers. Hats were flung high in the air, and their cheers for old Kentucky echoed and re-echoed along those grand old hills, while "Cheer, boys, cheer"-their battle-song--burst in joyous notes from groups gathered around the newly arrived friends. There were stationed Ijt this point, in addition to Colonel i Hanson's regiment, Captain Jack Allen and his men, besides  1 hundreds of others who had found their way thither from different  parts of the State.  Charley recognized in Colonel Hanson's regiment many of his I old friends who had left Louisville some months before, for Camp X Boone, among them Adjutant Frank Tryon, young Benedict and Delph, who hailed his arrival with open arms. Our young hero, eager for an opportunity to serve his country's  cause, soon enlisted in Company C, of the SecondKentucky, and  entered immediately upon the duties of a soldier. Others joined the Second Kentucky, while miost of the men found their way into the regiments of Colonels Hunt and Lewis. Captain Morgan and his company of forty men did not unite themselves to any command. Morgan wished to act as a partisan ranger, and addressed General Buckner a note, asking to be allowed to serve in this capacity. But it' not being deemed prudent to grant the request, and Morgan not wishing to be a burden to the cause, moved his men to the north bank of the river, rented a vacant house for them, and provided for all their wants. With this as his headquarters, he made the country between Green river and Bacon creek the scene of many a daring exploit, whichl history will yet record'to the honor of John Morgan, Kentucky's noblest chieftain.  '-  'I  '  ' ' ,2%i    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         41 CHAPTER VII. OF MORGAN AND HS MEN IROM LEXINGTON, AS GIVEN BY ONE OF THE PARTY.   CAMP FIRES were blazing brightly. The cold and silent stars looked out from their far-off blue home in heaven upon the quiet scene. The soft moonlight kissed the cold earth and lay in silvery sheets of beauty on the bosom of the gently stealing river. Silence had thrown its deep spell on every object, only broken at long intervals by the low monotone of the watch-dog. Two men threw themselves beneath a large tree' in front of a tent door, near one of the camp-fires. ' I will tell you, Will, the whole story," was the reply of the younger to the question of his friend. "We have had a hard time getting through to join this Southern cause, and I think with Morgan that we have a right to serve it as we think best. We had a company of sixty men, well drilled and well armed. John Morgan was our captain, and Basil Duke whom you have seen with us here, was first-lieutenant. Our intention was to serve our State,-to drive from her borders any foe that dared invade her soil. An order came to disarm the State Guard. We had long been objects of suspicion by blinded Union men, who had, in various epithets conferred upQn us, spoken out their disapprobation of our course. The Home Guard, under a Captain Woodson Price who was more distinguished for his artistic taste than good sense, had uttered base threats against us. This, of course, we did not heed. But when, that infamious craven legislature at Frankfort invited Anderson into Kentucky, and placed Crittenden in com- mand of the militia of the State, we saw what awaited all Southern men. Our company, of course, disbanded to avoid suspicion. As soon as General Buckner reached Bowling Green, Captain Morgan decided to join him. He made his purpose known to as many as he could meet, and they to others. It was assented to by a large majority. Preparations for leaving were secretly made. Each man had secured his gun and determined never to yield it, though he should die for refusing to do so.  42        BAIDS AND ROMANCE "We met at our secret rendezvous from night to night, and reported progress. It was deemed most prudent to leave the city in companies of two or three, at different hours and' by different routes, thus avoiding suspicion. We assembled at Lawrenceburg. Our arrangements for' provisions were intrusted to6 one of the company whom we knew to possess remarkable spirit and tact. As we passed along the streets we could hear threats pronounced against John Morgan and his men, and it was said currently and believed, that the most prominent of us were to be arrested. This we determined to avoid. The day appointed for setting out at length came round. Captain Morgan found himself narrowly watched, and was compelled to leave Lexington on foot, and meet ;^M a friend with his horse beyond the city limits. Others of us had i X to pretend we were going to Paris anrd Georgetown on- business. ? i; 'On departing, we could bring nothing with us that would i   X jeopardize us, so we had to leave our baggage and guns to our friends who were less suspected, and who were to come out at night. Some were to leave Wednesday, somne that night, and    X others less noted not until Thursday. Our plan succeeded ad- mirably. I believe not one, who set out for Camp Secret, lhas ,  A been arrested yet.         .? "In the course of twenty-four hours after Morgan entered Law-  i renceburg, he found himself at the head of fifty men. We remain- X: ed there a few hours awaiting others whom lhe hoped would join  . us. Some of our bravest men are behind. But they had large I  families, and I suppose felt they could not leave them. At Law-   renceburg, Morgan hired a man he could rely upon, and sent him - I to Louisville to inform old Prentice that he and -his men had been captured."                            :  "That was a happy ruse, indeed," interrupted the eager listen- ier. "I am convinced, after hearing your story, that Captain   i. Morgan should be left to pursue his own course. He can aidc the  : i cause in Kentucky, perhaps, better than any other man. His- family influence is extensive. He can command money, is ac-    X quainted with the State, and, above all, is a man of decision, en- ergy, and daring."            .           i l: Weeks passed by. Charley bhad become measurably inured to   : the duties-of a soldier's life. He could stand on picket or guard, i go scouting or foraging, make coffee or corn-bread. Prompt, obe- i  dient, kind, he won the respect of his officers, and the esteem of X his fellow-soldiers, and his faithfulness and daring had obtained the favorable notice of his colonel.

F MORGAN  OND HS MEN.        43 His letters to his friends at home were characterized by a slpirit of cheerful endurance of present discipline, and heroic deternlina- tion to make good his cause in the field of conflict. Hopeful, buoyant, he gilded the future with the bright hues of joyous expectancy, yet he realized that the life he had chosen was one of labor and hardship. "We shall have to endure many trials, mother, suffer many privations, make many sacrifices, but we shall conquer, shall surely triumph; the justice of our cause insudes success. There isnot a man in our regiment that would not prefer death to submission." His letters to Mary breathed the same spirit of hope and confidence, tempered, however, by a feel- ing of sadness at their separation, and an earnest desire that their meeting might not be far distant. Poor Mary! Over her young loving heart there had crept a shadow. And she who through life had ever been so joyous, so happy, Was now sad and thoughtful. Most of her time was 'passed with her mother, whose health grew daily more feeble, and who clung to ler child with that feeling of dependence which the weak manifest towards the strong. Meanwhile the Lincoln'hordes were pouring into Kentucky, possessing themselves of every point deemed important to their purpose of subjugation. The great heart of the State stood still before the unfoldings of the dread panorama. And those whose voice had been for "L Union" at the polls 'and in private, now began, with fearful forebodings, to ask themselves if the bayonet would accomplish the desired end. But what could be done? They had courted the oppression of the tyrant; had forged the fetters that enchained them. And now they stood helpless, hope- less, .the victims of, their own pusillanimity and avarice. While those who had ever opposed the coercion of free and sovereign States as the overthrow of civil liberty and constitutional right, robbed of their arms and of every privilege of freemen, denounced. as traitors, watched in every word and act, realizing that any show of resistance would be sheer folly, suffered themselves to be borne along by the current, and evpn swept into the fearful vor- tex. Better far had they resisted in the outset, and driven the invader back from tUb banks of the Ohio-.   Poor degraded, subjugated Kentucky I Thine is a sad story of vacillation and fear; of wrong and oppression. The faithful chronicler of this wicked war must pen with shame and regret thy irresolution, and its ruinous results. While I write, as one of thy children, I weep as my thoughts go back to thee in thy deep     "        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  humiliation, and linger amid thy once lovely scenes-thy'once   i free and happy sons and daughters, now so oppressed, so down- trodden. But thou wilt arise from thy$fiallen position. Even while I weep, the glad tidings comes sweeping in the breeze,  ' :?l "Kentucky determines to be free!" And now, at the last hour, I  thou wilt break the chains that bind thle, and wilt stand ranged  with thy Southern sisters, proudly free, determinedly defiant. \ t A vote of a party legislature- had invited Anderson, of Sumter 4 notoriety, into the State to take -charge of the troops within her borders. This wag a cunning pretext to open the way for the for- midable army that was soon to be thrown against Buckner at:J iBowling Green. The purpose of the Lincolnite dynasty had been served,' and Anderson, the man of an hour, the fool of an unprin- ^ icipled party, had been superseded by Buell, who was concentra- Sting his force as rapidly as possible, in front of Bowling Green. ; His advance, under Rousseau, already extended beyond Elizabeth- X itown, and between that point and Louisville troops were being  "  Imassed in numbers. Paducah, Smithland, and several interior   I 'towns were'already in their possession.             A  Major Breckinridge, having made his escape through the Federal lines, had reached Bowling Green, and there, in an address to the  land announced himself ready "to serve the Southern cause in what-  ever position might be assigned him. He received the commis-  -  sion of brigadier-general, and the Kentucky regiments were    X forined into a brigade, of which he was given the command.  iHanson's force was recalled to Bowling Green, and General Hind- X man thrown into position at Green river.            . It was proposed to establish a Provisional Governmen t for Ken- X tucky, that she might be represented in the Confederate congress. It was decided the Convention for that purpose should meet at   Russellville. The Federal authorities heard of the movement, and : declared the Convention should never assemble, and it was deter- .  mined to throw Crittenden's force so as to menace Russellville, and prevent the proposed meeting. General Buckner, learning the1 i: ] Federal programme, ordered Breckinridge to move from Bowling  .  Green to Russellville.                      X It waq the middle of November when Breckinridge and his command set out for Russellville. The weather was cold and   a l damp, and the roads muddy.

As he threw himself on his blanket, wenry with the fatigue of the day's marcll, and looked up into the face of the bending heavens above himn, thoughts of home and its coinforts, of its loved ones whom he might never again behold, stirred the deep depths of his soul. Tears sprung to his eyes, and he wept like a child. It was not sorrow nor apprehlension, but tender remembrances of the past that caused him tlius to grieve. There he lay thinking, his bosom heaving with varied emotions, his wearied frame stretched out on the hard ground, with no cover from tthe cold night air but his blanket wrapped around hllim, his knapsack for a pillow. As he dwelt on the wrongs inflicted on his State, the insolence of the oppressor, the sufferings that must -necessarily follow in the train of horrid war, then turned to the insulted South, noble in her determination, heroic in her struggle, his heart grew strong within him, his physical sufferings were for- gotten, lie heeded not his cold, hard bed, thought not of his .empty haversack, dreaded not the bloody battle-fi;ld. The Convention assembled, protected by those gallant men who fiully thwarted the plans of the Federals, keeping them at bay. About seventy counties were represented in the body. Resolu- tions were adopted, declaring that in view of the unconstitutional acts of the administration at Washington, and the belief that the war was one of usurpation and subjugation, Kentucky, as a sov- ereign State, had a right to withdraw herself from the Federal compact, and choose her own position. On the 19th of November, the Ordinance of Secession was passed. George W. Johnson was made Provisional Governor, and members to the Confederate congress were appointed from every district in the State represented in the Convention. The Assembly having adjourned, Breckinridge, with his forces, was ordered back to Bowling Green. After remaining there for some days, the order was given that they should go back to Roch- est er, a point on Green river, in Butler county, in order to pre vent a supposed flankl movement of the Federals. From Rochester they returned to Bowling Green, and proceed- ed to Cave City, where, after remaining for several weeks, they wee dispatched to Glasgow, to-intercept an anticipated move- ment of the enemy in that direction. The rain poured in torrents, freezing as it fell. The men were drenched through and through, as they ploughed through the dreadful roads, knee- deep in mud , On and onthey trudged, over many a weary I1j             ;                     . -'      : 46       RAIDS AND ROMANCE mile, dripping with wet, shivering with cold, i-eady to sirk with V fatigue.            i: The alarm was false, and after they had proceeded one-tliird of ;I tile way, a courier came to countermand the order. Back the  :i whole force was turned, to retrace the miserable road. The mlen i were sorely tried under this unnecessary experience, and their i displeasure found vent in bitter murmurings. i     a    , Many a "narrow house" at Bowling Green, all unmarked by    X love's kind hand, tells the sad tale of this dreadful Inarch. And in many a quiet churchyard and family burying-ground through-  : out Kentucky, the stricken mourner bends over the quiet dust of . : the loved cne lost, whose life was there sacrificed. Our young hero had a fine constitution, which had been well  : I preserved and developed. But' those drenching marches had   - 'sorely tried it, and, its vigor and power had finally to succumb 1 before the insidious advance of disease, which first manifested A itself in a slight cold, and then rapidly developed itself into a : I severe attack of pneumonia. Now rose up before his fevered imagination all the horrors of the hospital, with its tearful suffer-  ings, its almost certain death.     J! "Oh, do not take me there t" he said, pointing to the gloomy / building that stood before him. "Leave me here to die."    :-4 Thbrough the exertions of Lieutenant Tryon, a bed was procured i: fo'klimn a private house, to which he was borne, and where he was as carefully attended as circumstances would admit. There was a great deal of sickness in the army at Bowling Green, and l / every house was filled with the sufferers. Measles, fOver, and X pneumonia prevailed most fearfully. -,i Charley grew rapidly worse. His symptoms were of the most alarming riature. His physician, Dr. Lindley, pronounced the  t case as one of a malignant character, and gave but little encourage- ment to hope for his recovery. A friend of Charley's, from Louisville, being informed of his situation, sought him out, that he might minister to his sufferings. This gentleman found him in a- ;  small unventilated room, where lay three other sick soldiers, two on the floor, one in the bed beside Charley. ,X The air was foul with the fumes odf tobacco, while the greatest untidiness and neglect were everyWhere visible. Charley was wild with fever. He, of course, required the most profound quiet, and yet a band of musicians was quartered in the building, and X ever at their pleasure they made the air resonant with their martiai rehearsals. The kind fiiend found he must certainly die if left to I 1X   OF IOCGA0 AND HS MEN.       47 remain in that dreadful condition, and determined to hazard his removal, despite the assertion of the phlysician, wiho declared iim- peratively that such an act would be followed by ce/tain death. An apartment was secured away from the noise and confusion of the town, and thither, Charley was taken. A skilful nurse was procured, and after weeks of pain and feebleness, he so far re- covered as to be pronounced beyond danger. It was a cold, bleak morning in December. The snow, which had fallen the previous night, covered the earth with its white mantle of purity. The sun shone brilliantly out from the loudless V heavens, and as his golden beams fell over the earth, they awoke to life a flood of glorious radiance most beautiful to behold. The majestic trees, draped in their robes immaculate, caught up the dazzling effulgence, and sent it back in prismal loveliness over hill and plain and ice-clad brook. Charley sat, a convalescent, beside the hugely blazing log-fire, which, spairkling and crackling as if in merriment, sent its dancing flames, of fiery hue, here and there, up, across, athwart, as if in merry mimic of carniva} holiday. His chair was so situated as to give him a full view of the scene without, through the window at his left, from which the, red curtain-had' been lifted. There he sat, thinking, thinking. i And of what could he be thinking but of home and Mary? He sighed most deeply, and passed his hand slowly over his pale brow, as there came up before him the long, long, weary days since he had heard from the loved one whose image lived in his heart, whose soft sweet look was ever with him, whether in the weary march, or in ,the still deep hours of midnight he lay dreaming of the bliss to come. "To see her once again," he said to himself, as he leaned his head on his hand, " would be more to me than the elixir of life to Oriental magician. I shouldlNe well again, could I but lock on her faultless form, gaze into the pure living depths of those soft blue eyes, and clasp that gentle hand in mine. But, ah me, many a day shall come and go before we meet. And it may be-y-es, it may be-"   He dared not complete the dread sentence. He shuddered with fear like one sleized with a sudden chill-tears camne to his eyes, and he bowed his head yet lower on his hand.   e Thus he sat for several minutes, thinking, fearing, feeling: Then rising, he walked feebly to a little dressilng-stand on the other side of the fireplace, and took from its drawer a picture. Reseating himself, 1he opened it, and gazed intently on the face before him.-     48        RA. S MAD ROMANCE  His countenance wore the look of saddened love-his cheek was ' flushed, his lland trembled.                  A rap was heard at the door. Supposing it was his physician, X whose hour it was to make his morning call, he hastily thrust the picture into his bosom, (its usual resting-place), and wiping the tears from his eyes with his hand, he assumed, as far as he could, his I wonted look of cheerfulness. The door opened. Charley  l turned to bid the physician good-morning, His eye rested on a  strange form, muffled in overcoat and comforter to shut, out the  bleak winter air.                       a Ciharley bade the visitor "Good-morning," and requested him to walk to the fire, pointing him to a chair which stood near the dressing-case.  The stranger did not obey the invitation, but stood eyeing the invalid with a quizzical look. Charley's face colored deeply, and ; strange fancies began to fill his bewildered brain. The visitor  threw offl his cap, and hastily drew the comforter from his face. "John!" ejaculated Charley, as he stretched out his .thin, pale hand towards him. It was all he could say, for a moment. John' Lawrence (for it was he), the brother of Mary, and Charley's life-  long friend, grasped the feeble hand and shook it most heartily. Then drawing the chair to Charley's side, he recounted to him all - ! the incidents of his escape from Louisville, and the various adven- j tures that had befallen him by the way.    :       - "And I have two letters for you, Charley." And theayoung  i man turned up the left leg of his pantaloons, and with his knife maksing an opening in the lining, drew fortt two sheets of tissue paper, closely written, and tossed them into the invalid's lap. "I : tell you, my friend, they have had many a hair-breadth escape, ! and could they tell their own story, it would prove no uninterest-  ing history, I assure you." '   ' Charley tore off the gauzy envelopes, and looked for the signa- . tures. One was from his sister Lu, the other from Mary.

"I think you will no longer need my care." After a few minutes' conversation, the physician rose to leave, telling Charley lie would not call again, unless sent for, as he was now entirely free from danger, and only needed care to restore liiin to health. Young Lawrence, or John, as we shall most frequently style hin in our future narrative, remained with his friend for several hours, and when he left to report himself, and obtain a position in Colonel Hanson's regiment, if possible, it was under promise to return as soon as this business could be arranged. John was not only placed in the desired regiment, but also in Company O, a vacancy having been made by the death of one of the members. Charley, as Dr. Lindley had said, grew rapidly well, and in the lapse of two weeks from the physician's last call, he was ready to join lhis regiment, and resume his duties as a soldier. Many a familiar face was absCnt.  Some lay on beds of linger- ing languor in the dreary hospitals. Others were quietly resting beneath the new-made earth in the soldiers' burying-ground. 3     50        R AIDS AND ROMANCE  t    i st CHAPTER VIII.  GENERAL BUCKNER ORDERED TO RBINFORCE FORT DONELSON. CHRIISTMAS came and passed. But little of a striking character I  connected with the Confederate army in Kentucky had yet trans- pired. They had served for montths to hold in check the immense Federal force that had been throw-n into the State, and thus had  rendered to the Confederacy most valuable service,- by giving it time to expand and strengthen its resources. It was the last days of January, 1861. The army had remained  at Bowling Green since the 18th of September previous. Each  day intelligence was received that the Yankees would very soon  make an attack. Already had the gallant Terry fallen at Green ; river. Already had all the tropps been withdrawn from along the line of the Louisville and Nashville railroad, and concentrated, behind the fortifications at Bowling Green, and their old encamp-  ments were occupied by the advancing foe, who 4varily yet stead- fastly moved on towards the accpnmplishment of his purpose. It became evident to General A. S. Johnston that Bowling  Green must be evacuated, particularly as the enemy was now making extensive preparations to attack Forts Henry and Donel-  son by water; butlhis determination was to hold out at the above ?: mentioned place as long as possible, in order that the fortifications at Donelson might be made as strong as practicable.  General Buckner had received orders from General Johnston to  - move with his division against the Federal General Orittenden, who with a considerable force was posted at Rochester, a small  town in Butler county, of which mention has hitherto been made. In obedience to' the command, General Buckner took with him eight regiments, numbering in all about seven thousand men, among them the Second Kentucky, Colonel Hanson, the Fourteenth Missis- sippi, Colonel Harper, and the Third Tennessee, Colonel Brown. General Floyd accompanied him with his Virginia troops,-the : whole force amounting to about nine thousand. The command left Bowling Green for Rochester via Russellville. The rain commenced to pour in torrents on the first day of the march. a I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         51 Reaching Russellviie, it was found ilpossible to proceed further, owing to the imlassable state of the roads. While thus detained orders came to General Buckner to hasten to Donelson, for tle purpose of reinforcing the garrison there. Ciharley, seated cn a camp-stool at the door of his tent, his paper resting on hw s knee, was busily writing a letter to Mary. The rain fell unceasing from the thick black clouds above. The winter wind blew fiercely through'the leafless branches of the old forest-teees, which stood like the grim sentinels of some enchant- ed land. Its voice sounded mournfully solemn as it swept onward by th tent door, over the dreary meadow-land, and lost itself amid the thick 'undergrowth of the dark gloom of the dense forest beyond. To the ear of Charley, it seemed like the low plaintive dirge of a lost spirit. The scene was dreary and cheerless enough to oppress the stoutest heart with loathing disgust for the present and dread apprehensions for 'the future, and, despite of all his endeavors to the contrary, Charley's words would breathe a true spirit of subdued thoughlt very nea akin to sadness. The dark trials ewhich ere so soon to be realized by many a bold defiant heart, seemed to throw their shadows over the present, and to forewarn of coming defeat and humiliation. "I know not why I thus feel, my dear Mary," wrote Charley, after speaking his fears and apprehensions. "t is so unusual for me to be overcome by gloomy presentiinents. But I cannot rid myself of the feeling. Indeed, it reaches conviction, that there is sorrow in store for us. I have never been so impressed before since I parted with you, and my dear, dear friends.

It was now evident to the men that some fighting must be done; they were now, for the first time, to meet the foe. Victory or death was their watch word, and nobly did they make it good throughout those memorable three days, when, fron early morn- ing until night, they repulsed, with superhuman energy, the hosts  of the beleaguerers.

WHAT varied emotions are called into life at the mention of that name-Fort/ Donelson! Emotions of sadness, as the mind recalls the sufferings, privations, and defeat of those gallant men -those more than Spartan defenders-who, for three long weary days of carnage, maintained the unequal contest against such fearful odds; and who It last yielded because nature, exhausted, could no longer obey the biddings of their unconquerable cour- age: emotions of unbounded admiration, as we think of the dar- ing, endurance, patriotism, and nerve manifested by that devoted band, who, under circumstances the most trying, without food or adequate clothing, meeting and driving back through the day the countless hordes of the assailants, and at night, hungry and worn from the conflict, sleeping in trenches filled with mud and ice, till many were frozen, while the pitiless sleet beat furiously over them, yet, like veterans, like brave, patriotic men as they were, meeting all these horrors, enduring all this unparalleled hardship uumurmuringly, and with firm, undaunted soul, rising with each rising morn to strike for freedom and for right. This dreadful war hath mnany a page all bright and glorious with the heroic daring, the patriotic fortitude, the brilliant victory of Southern freemen, but none can ever be more lustrous, can ever speak in words of more thrilling eloquence to the generations of all coming years, than that of Donelson, the synonym of all that is sublime in suffering, heroic in daring, and nobly triumphant in patriotism. On the 10th of February, General Pillow reached Donelson, and took comma nd. Immediately every thing was in busy activity, to place the fort in a defensive condition against the expected attack by land and river. "The space to be defended by the army was quadrangular in shape, being limited on the north by the Cumberland river, and on the east and west by small streams, now converted into deep sloughs by the high water, and 'on the south by our line of defence. i      54        BATDS AND ROMANCE  The river-line exceeded a inile ifl length. The line of defence was about one mile and a halt f long, and its distance from the river varied from one-fourth to three-fourths of a mile ."  Thle line of intrenchments, of a few logs rolled together, and but slightly coveretd with earth, formed an insufficient protection even against field artillery. Not more than a third of the line was completed on the morning of the 12th. It had been located  near the crest of a series of ridges, which sloped backwards to  the river, and which were 'again -colnmmanded in several p1laces by the ridges at a still greater distance from the river . Thi chain of heights was intersected by deep valleys and ravines, b which materially interfered with communications between differ- elit parts of the line. Between tthe vilage of Dover and the water batteries a broad and deep valley, extending back from the river, and flooded by the high water, intersected the quadrangular area occupied by the army, and almost completely isolated the  right wing.             ,  There were but thirteen guns, and, on tria, it was fpund that only three of this number were effective against the gunboats. X The garrison numbered only "13,000 troops, all told." These consisted of Tennessee and Mississippi regiments, under General Pillow, General Floyd's brigade, and a portion of General Buck-  ner's command from Bowling Green, which did not reach thle fort until the 12th, ,only the day before the attack, while General Floyd did not arrive until the morning of the 13th.     : The morning of the 13th of February rose bright and beautiful. Just as the first rays of thedawning sun, banrting through the fleecy clouds of the morning, fell over the earth, the loud booming of ; the cannon aroused the expectant garrison, and announced the beginning of that fierce conflict which was to last throughout  three fearful days.  Tile men, sprang to arms, eager for the contest. Soon, under the direction of their officers, they were formed into line of battle, and in a few brief mnoments the strife commenced on the right wing, commanded by Buckner, and raged in wildest fury. On and on came the moving lines of the foemen, encountering the iwell-directed fire of infantry and artillery. The massed col- umns wavered and fell back with fearful slaughter. Not a South- erner faltered. Officers displayed the most daring courage, riding up and down the ranks cheering their men,and inciting them to deeds of valor, while the men, fighting for homes and liberty, ri- valled each other in death-defying heroism.   OF MORGAN AND HS fMEN.         55 At 10 o'clock, the extreme right of General Buckner's line, un- der Colonel Hanson, was desperately attacked, the enemy advan- cing in column, manifesting a determination to take the position at  all hazards. On came the serried hosts. "Wait, boys, until they come within range of your guns," was the command. Thle gallant 2d Kentucky, fired with a desire to repulse the dark foe, could scarcely restrain their ardor. "Fire!"The ord'3W ran swift along the line, and volley after volley of musketry, min-N gling with the roar and bursting of shells and the crashing of artil- a lery, poured into the ranks of the assailants. Ah, it was a fearful sight to witness the carnage and death that swept along that close, dense line. Like grain before the reaper's sickle, they fell, mowed down by bullet, shell, and shot. Affrighted, they paused-'twas but for a momnent rallying, they pressed forward. Again sped the horrid missiles of death fromn the intrenchments, and down went scores of the rash besiegers, mangled, torn, bleeding, writhing in the tortures of agony and death. Discomfited, the decimated regi- ments retire, to make room for others, who dash on to tihe same dreadful fate. Thrice is the attack made on this point by fresh and heavy forces-thrice is the foe repulsed with dreadful slaugh- ter. The batteries of the Confederates, managed with precision and skill-each man performing his part with the greatest enthu- siasm-at every discharge, cut long lanes through the serried col- umns of the assailants. Repulsed, defeated at this point, the enemy, with fresh troops, turned his assault on the position beyond General Buckner's left, held by Colonel Heiman, jand flanked by Grave's battery, which, from its location, swept with its deadly fire the valley through which the Federals had to advance. On they came, with A1rm, undaunted step, knowing not that they were marching to the death. With banners proudly waving, and officers splendidly uniformed, cheering their men to victory, they dash on-on-on I All is silent on the part of the besieged. With a shout of triumph the armed forces press forward. Loud, as if a thousand thunders had leaped from their wild storm-cloud- reverberating through the valleys, and bounding against the hills, to be re-echoed in tenfold fury-burst upon the air the .hideous bellowing of the wide-mouth cannon; while the crash and hiss of  shredding bullets which fell like the thick hail on the close lines, sweeping down in one wide welter, hundreds of stricken men, added to the loud, wild din, until the earth shook, and the air re- sounded with the terrible conflict.     56        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  Louder and louder grew the mingling clash of arms: fiercer, and  yet more fierce the dreadful struggle. But its fiendish fury lasted but for a few minutes. The assailants, unable to*stand the leaden storm in front and the destructive flank fire from Grave's battery, like their comrades, faltered onward; then, as if broken by the  hand of divine vengeance, affrighted, panic-stricken, they turned  and fled in wild confusion.  Hundreds of their number lay mangled, wounded, torn, dying on the battle-field, trampled beneath the feet of their retreating A comrades. Their guns had been silenced-many of their officers i  had fallen-yet, unwilling to yield the contest, they poured fresh troops against the intrenchments, and the deadly strife went on.  All through that long dread day, the battle raged most fearfully; , : and as night closed in upon the sickening carnage, the enemy, re- pulsed, cut to pieces, slain in hundreds, was driven to seek his position of the morning, leaving the field covered with his dead and dying. Ah it was a sad, sad sight to see them there, cut down in their manhood's prime, in servile obedience to the behest of a  tyrant.                 '  Many who, but a few hours before, had marched forth with strong hearts, and arms well nerved, now lay stiff and cold in death. Many weltered in their gore far away from all relief, send-  ; ing ott on the dead, dull ear of night, piteous moans and cries for  help, which, alas, would never come; for when the morning rose and woke to life their comrades, they had passed away. On the bloody battle-field lay friend and foein ghastly death en-  wrapt. Everywhere were mingled, mangled forms of men, and horses, and broken remains of guns and caissons. In some places j  the dead bodies lay piled several feet deep. In many instances,  the wounded lay pinned to the moist, cold ground by the forms i of dead comrades, whose fixed and agonizing eyes looked out as if in search of the foe; while the shrieks of the suffering and dying broke in horrid cries on the ears of those who could give them -no aid. Faint and low was the plaintive wail of some, as with the life-blood ebbing fast from their gaping wounds, they turned their wild, glaring eyes upward and vainly implored help. All, it was a sight fearfully appalling, that battle-field of Donel- son. For two miles the slain were thickly strewn, and in places where our artillery had mowed them down, they lay literally heap- ed, soddening in their gore. The morning had opened beautifully bright. Towards the afternoon a fierce wind swept from the north, bringing on its e     I   w     I -  I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         57 clareering bosom rain, and sleet, and snow. A more fearful night could not be conceived than that which rested over the blood- bathed battle-field after that first day's conflict. Those of the wounded who survived the horrors of that memorable night, had  their clothes stiff frozen to their gaping wounds, while the sleet and snow fell pitilessly over their prostrate forms writhing in tortures of helpless, hopeless agony. Those of the garrison who had fallen beyond the intrenchments slhared the direful fate of the prostrate enemy. For so close were the two armies as they rested for the night, that neither dared to nake an effort to alleviate the sufferings of their wounded. Our men, who had fought throughout the day, weary, worn, exhausted by their superhuman efforts, threw themselves on their arms in the trenches to catch such repose as tire shelling, which was kept up at intervals through the night by the enemy, would allow. "This is terrible," said Charley. to John Lawrence, who lay beside him in th pit shivering with cold, while the freezing sleet dashed into their faces and fell in icy showers over their benumbed bodies, as everand anon the bursting shellsfrorn the enemy's batteries came whizzing through the air on their errand of death. 'Terrible! terrible!" replied his comrade. "We hall all be frozen by morning; it is impossible to live through such a night as this, lying here in the mud and snow, without any protection. But we have whipped the Lincolnites most soundly, and this is some consolation, Charley, if we do freeze to death. The poor wretches, I wonder ltow they feel to-night after their drubbing. I pity them, foes as they are." At that momrent a piercing moan was heard just outside the intrenchment, near where the two were lying, and a voice, in the accents of despair, gasped out, "Water water I for God's sake; boys, give me water! I aln dying!" "Tlhat is one of our men," said Charley, rising to his knees. "Listen! don't you hear? he is near us. I must give the poor fellow water, if they kill me for it. I cannot let him lie there and die. Go with me, John, perhaps we can succeed in bringing him in!" "They may shoot us, Charley, as they did those boys that went out just after dark to bring in our wounded. But we must risk it. I would sooner perish than listen to those pitiful groans. Have you any water in your canteen? Mine is empty." "Enough for him." !.  iS'      58        RAIDS AND ROMANOE The two rose cautiously, and, guided by the sad, low moans, proceeded warily under cover of the trees to where the sufferer lay. "Water, boys, water," said the wounded man, as the noise of footsteps fell on his dull ear. i' I all dying-will no one give me  a drop of water? Oh, for God's sake, a little water, i'm dying. Just a little water, then 'll die in peace."  Bending low, and lifting the feeble head, Charley placed his  "God bless you, boys! I was ready to perish, but you have  saved me," he said, in low, faltering tones. "Could you take me from this place? I am freezing, dying. Ah, my poor wife, my  dear children! God in heaven pity them!"  "Be quiet, friend, and we will do for you what we can,"  whispered Charley: a If you make a noise we may all be shot.  Where are you wounded?"  "There, in mn ankle," and the man, with a desperate effort, struggled up and placed his hand upon the bleeding limb. As he  did so, he shrieked with pain.  "Be quiet," whispered Charley, "or the Yankees will shoot "The bone is shattered, and I am so faint I can't sit up," and  the poor man relaxed his hold on young Lawrence's arm, and would have fallen backward to the ground had not Charley caught,  and supported him.   b   "Lean on us, and we will bear you in."     :  "God bless you, boys," said the wounded man, with something  like animation in this voice. "I may yet live." With great effort thb two bore him within the intrenchments, and securing a place of safety and comfort for him, called a sur-  geon'to dress his wounds. We shall have hot work to-morrov, Charley," said Lawrence, 4s they resumed their places in the trenches. "These Lincolnites  have a strong force, and they will bring their gunboats into the  action."  We shall whip them for all that," was the heroic reply; " that is, if we don't all freeze to-night. But, really, I doln't believe I jcan live till morning in this condition." "I don't fear a thing but the boats, Charley. But I do quake a little at the thought of those monster balls whizziig round my ears." t"Soon get used to them, John. And if we die, we perish in a glorious cause. lthis is my doctrine, and I'm not going to let I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.          59 their gunboats, or any thing else, scare me, And after all, the balls from their gunboats will be directed against the water bat- teries, and can do us but little harm, I imagine. But their troops surprised me, Johln. They fought like men in earnest. I had no idea they had so much spirit. Poor fellows, they were sadly-cut to pieces. Their loss must be three or four times urs."  "Oh, these Western men are brave, Charley. It's all a mistake to say they are Yankee cowards.  They can fight like wild- cats. But they are pretty well used up. I think they'll need some rest before they attack us again." '"But, doubtless, they will be heavily reinforced before they renew the attck," replied Charley. "There's no end to the num- ber of these men. This is our only danger. If they can bring flesh troops against us to-morrbw, I don't see how we can hold out. But Buckner is here, and I'll trust to him." "Yes, indeed, I'll risk my Ifate in his hands. He'll bring us through, my word for that." Just then a shell came whizzing by, and exploded at no great distance from where they lay. It did no damage.   'They wlon'tlet us sleep a wink to-night, Charley. I do wish they would cease firing until daylight." I "But I must aleep, John, if they do shell us, and so must you. We won't be able to fight to-morrow if we don't. We must take our clhances-no use trying to escape." The two selected as comfortable a posture as was possible, and fell into a slumber, from which they were frequently aroused by the passage of a ball or shell, as it swept onward. The long and dreary night, passed away, and smorning came all too soon for those weary men, who, worn out with the fierce con- test, lay sleeping in the uncovered pits, while the sleet and snow fell thick and fast upon them. At the tap of the drum they sprang from their fitful sleep, and seized 'their arms. Their hearts were brave, and they longed again to meet the baffled foe. -There he lay, with his gigantic numbers, within view of the fort, but as yet manifested no signs of rdnewing the attack. Our men, after vainly waiting some time for his advance, snatched a Hasty meal, and immediately placed themselves again in line of battle. There they stood in the trenches, through the long, dread hours, the mud and ice-water up to their knees, expecting every moment the presence of the foemen. But nothing was heard from him through the morning, save the shells which he unceasingly threw into the fort.  ,              ,     ,     60        RAIDS AND ROMANCE! But he was /not idle. A plan for an attack by the gunboats was being arranged, and meanwhile large reinforcements were  landed from transports, which everywhere lined the river below thie fort.          . Their plans were fully comprehended lby General Buckner, who, in a council of general officers called during the morning, advised that an immiediate effort shlould be made by the garrison to cut its way out, while the enemy, prostrated by the defeat of the previ. , ous day, was colnparatively helpless, and before the reinforce- mnents, fifteen thousand strong, should disembark. The proposi- ! tion was assented to by all present. General Buckuer proposed  : to cover the ret-eat of the arlmy With his division, in the event - the attempt should prove a success. The troops were drawn out, , " and every preparation made, both by Generals Buckner and Pil-  ; " low, to execute the movement, when, to th6 surprise of the former! r  general, the order was countermanded by General Floyd, influ- encedi to the decision by the unwise council of General Pillow,  who alleged the lateness of the hour as a reas n for thy aban- donment of the plan.  I  l: 'Early in the afternoon the' gunboats were observed to be   X advancing to attack the river batteries, and at three o'clock a j? vigorous fire was issued from five boats, approaching in echelon, : throwing shot into the fort as they moved slowly and majestically ti  forward.           - The gunners waited until the advance boats were within effect-  ive range of our guns. Then, at a signal, every gun, twelve in  number, belched forth its missile of destruction and death.  1 Still, amid the dreadful storm of shotlnd shell the defiant fleet  moves on, confident in its strength, until it approaches within a few hundred yards of the fort. For a inoment the guns are- silent; then, in tones louder than Vesuvius's dread voice, they pour forth their deafening roar, and the fiefry death-weapons speed on their unerring course.      ' 'Higher and higher swelled the tumult-dreadful and more dreadful grew the fierce conflict. , The ground shook as with the throes of an earthquake. The /air resounded for miles with the bellowings of the death-dealing guns. The heavens were shut oft by the clouds of dense, black smoke. Shells crossed end recrossed each other at every conceivable angle; those of the fort plunging into the river with fearful rapidity, sending the white spray high in air, or striking against the iron sides of some vessel, would make it creak and quiver through every timber.   o  N M,RG aN AND HS MEN. I      61 The five boats respond with equal energy; and a sixth, some- what modestly in the rear of the others, sends her conical shot at rapid intervals into the fort.        j Now the leaden conflict rages with renewed viior; shell and shot pour like rain over every thing. See! the Essex, mistress of the fleet, reels and plunges-she is struck, disabled. She pauses for a moment, thlen turning about, retires from the scene. The gunners of the fort point their guns with precision. Then bursts forth a wild and stunning explosion. Another boat is pierced in ]her iron casements, and her timbers creak and crash and splinter in the air. A few moments later, and another is struck, which makes hier metal sides ring. Her guns are silenced. She writhes and quivers like some dread monster in his death throes, and is withdrawn froni the conflict. The remaining boats kept up a rapid fire. The batteries fail to respond.  Ah, they are at last silenced. The foe has triumphed amid his destruction. But the delusion lasts but for a moment. 'A fearful shock rends the air, as a broadside from the rft p(ours into the two remnaining boats, and sends them reeling and drifting down the stream. The foe is vanquished-l- is fleet crippled. Shout a er shout, long, loud, victorious, rings forth on the cold winter ir, as the men belold the haughty foe driven from his unholy undertaking. Two days   bad passed, and yet the garrison, famished, freezing, overcome by incessant duty, held out.!Yea, far more; they had repulsed the hosts of the enemy on land, and shattered hi mighty fleet.              . It -was night, cold, freezing, rayless. The weary men again laid themselves down   on their arms in the wet and muddy trenches, to snatch what sleep they could. At headquarters, Generals Floyd, Pillowr, and Buckner sat in grave consultation. The question was, "W hat should be done on the following day?"  Should the garrison remain in the intrenct- ments, and attempt to vanquish the attacking foe, or should they endeavor to cut their way out, and fall back on Nashville? It was known that throughout the day heavy reinforcements had been received by the enemy, and that he had so disposed himself as even now to almost completely envelop the fort. His gunboats would conmmand the river; thereby cutting off all reinforcelnents and s  uapplies from Cumberland city. The question was a serious one, and required grave consideration. The men were greatly exhausted through  fighting and loss ot sleep, and it was felt that     62        R AIDS AND ROMAA    ' N unless they could be relieved'by fresh troops, it would be impos- sible for them to hold out more than one day longer.  The question was fully debated. Each general unreservedly expressed his opinion. At length it was determined that the gar- rison, if it were possible, should cut its way out, and thus attempt to gain the open country south of the fort. Iti was a fearful alternative for men weary, hungry, stiff with  cold; their clothes frozen to their bodies, many of them with   1 inferior guns, to make their passage through quadruple their nunm- ber of fresh troops, well-armed, and supported by heavy batteries and gunboats. Yet, desperate as it was, it was the only thing left  for those brave men to do. Well may we stand aghast, and our hearts cease their beatings  while we contemplate the dreadful picture.  Iwas agreed in general council that at 'daylight the next morning General Pillow should attack the right wing of the  eneiny, resting on the river, while General Buckner, with his forces, should make an effort to drive him back on the Winn's  FerI'y road; and, if successful in the attempt, the two forces were  to unite and pursue their way through the -pen country south-   : ward towards Nashville.  Confident of success on the following morning, the enemy, hav- ing disposed his forces, rested quietly through the night. He felt that his victim was immeshed, and he could, at his leisure, over- come and destroy it.

At an early hour the men were called from their sleepless night in the trenches, to prepare for the day's conflict. Ahf and such a conflict the world has rarely ever witnessed. Brave men of Donelson, honor, ever- lasting honor must needs be your meed from a grateful and ad- miring nation,! And when you have passed away, and we, hav- ing conquered this bloody struggle, shall stand forth a free, happy, and prosperous people, to have fought at Donelson will be a nobler fame than to have conquered( on the battle-plains of Waterloo. At the signal the men seized their arms, fell into line, and fol- lowing their leaders pressed forward to the carnage. General Pillow Inarched upon the right wing of the enemy, whom he found in advance of his encampment, ready to receive him. And now came one of the most sanguinary struggles recorded in the'annals of any war. The Confederates, whose watchword was victory or death, drove upon the mighty foe, sending volley after volley into his serried ranks, everywhere dealing death and ruin. But the enemy, confident in his numbers, replied with courage and determina- tion;. nd as quiqkly as his lines were thinned they were filled up with fresh forces. On pressed the garrison, to triumph or the grave-they cared but little which, as they confronted the vile  invader of their soil.  Stubbornly were their fierce onsets met, the sullen foe fight- ing with unwonted valoq C(harge succeeded charge, ias fiercer and fiercer grew the bloody strife. The thick ranks of the foe were thinned but to be supplied with fresh victims for the slaugh- ter.  The earth shook with the fury of the battle, while the air re- sounded with the roar of cannon, and the loud peals of the rifle and musket. The dead and wounded fell on every side, trampled ,      "        RAIDS AND ROMANCE to the earth beneath the feet of the onward moving columns. At length, after the most desperate resistance, the foe wavered. For- ward rushed our forces upon themn with the fury of enraged mad-  men. But the enemy was not routed, and as the Southerners charged, they were met by a fierce and destructive fire. But tile advantage gained must not be lost, and with renewed determina- tion the Confederates dashed on. Inch by inch the foe receded, contesting every step with fearful obstinacy. But at length, after six hours' engagelnent, they were compelled to! yield before the impetuosity of men fighting for their lives. The field was won; and shouts that made the heavens ring went upi fromm the victori- ous troops as they saw the enemy were driven before them. General Buckner, as was agreed, attacked the forces that were I  massed against his left. Desperate beyond conception was the engagement between this small band of heroes and the formidable \  hosts of the opposer. The enemy were stronger here than in firont of General Pillow's position, and fought with a steady de- : termination rarely exhibited by themn. The contending columns -  swayed to and fro, as first one and then the other gained the ad- !, vantage. The fighting on all parts of the field was of the most : desperate character.                     : Never was there witnessed a wilder scene of combat. For, as rank after rank of ithe enemy fell before the furious onset, the j doolned victims rushed in to fill their vacant places. On moved the garrison like an "Alpine avalanche," sweeping every thing ! before it. The battle-field was one of awful sublimity. The ! shrieks of the-wounded and dyingD mingled with the roar of the  cannon and the clash of musketry in one loud deafening din. The  shells went through the air with sharp whizzing, as they sped on their mission of death.                 a The foe was repulsed, routed, and the conquerors mingled their M shouts and cheers with those of their victorious comrades under General Pillow., The enemy was defeated, driven back. The plan devised by the council of Confederate officers had succeeded admirably. A way of escape had been opened for the brave and'gallant garrison by its own noble achievements. Quadruple its own trength of fresh troops had been driven back by men "worn with watching, with labor, with fighting.'  Untading laurels-will ever wreath the brows of the heroes of that memorable 15th of February, 1861q4 General Buckner's division having driven back the entire force of l  I v   -   OF MORGAN  AND HS MEN.       , 65 the enemy to the right of the Wynn's Ferry road, leaving this route and ttie Forge road open for the egress of the garrison, were awaiting the arrival of their artillery and the reserves that had been left to hold the trenches, when General Buckner received reiterated orders to fall back to the intrenchinents on the extreme right. 'Surprised, shocked, stunned at such a command at such a time, and under such circumstances, he could not believe that it had jemanated from the commanding general. To retire back to the intrenchmllentsi and thus place themselves again in the power of the foe, and that, too, at the point when the object for which the men had fought desperately for seven hours was fully gained, seemed to him madness of the wildest nature. To fall back was the certain destruction of the entire Confederate force. To advance from their present safe position, would be the salvation of the whole garrison. Galloping back to the lines, he encountered General Floyd, and made known to him the orders he had received. The command- ing general, surprised, astonished, pronounced it a mistake. 'Wait, general," replied General Floyd to General Buckner. "Let me look into this. Remain in your present position until I can. converse withl General Pillow." In a very short time after this meeting, General Buckner re- ceived orders imperatively to repair as rapidly as he could to his former position on the extreme right. I Nothing was left him but to obey, although he knew that he and his men were going back to certain death, or inevitable surrender. Two miles of retreat were trod by the weary and now dis- heartened men. On nearing their intrenchments they found the right of their position already occupied by the enemy. A desper- ate fight ensued, in which the Confederates succeeded in keeping at bay about five times their number. Niglht closed the dreadful scene. The enemy occupied the Confederate works on General Buckner's right, ready to resume the attack with overwhelming force as soon as the morning should dawn.  The fort was soon reinvested by the enemy with the fresh reinforcements received, as was shown by a thorough recon- noissance made bv Colonel Forrest. And thus, after three days' hard fighting, hardships, privations, and sufferings, such as sol- diers have rarely ever been called on to endure, after having once extricated itself, through the want of prudence and generalship of We  w         I     "        MAIDS Am) ROMANCE  General Pillow, the heroic garrisons was caught in the toils-- doomed-sacrificed. A sad page in our country's history. Would it had never been written. Again the dreary night came down lover the earth, wrap- ping in its folds of thick darkness that appalling scene of car- nage.        .                    ' In a tent, there sat the commanding officers of the garrison, grave, sad, thhoughtful. They liad essayed the daring effort of cutting their way out, but found tlhemselves, after a successful effort, back again in their old position, and again environed bylthe wily foe. Their meni had fought like heroes, but now they were i0 exhausted, and could fight no longer. They could not escape secretly, for the enemy completely surrounded them, leaving no e possible outlet. ihe command and position must be surrendered to the. victorious foe-a sad, but only, alternative. Everywhere were the horrid witnesses to that fearful struggle,  ii which, for nine dreadful hours, had raged in wildest fury. Men- S dead, dying, mangled-horses, gun-carriages, broken muskets,  : cartridge-boxes, knapsacks-all the paraphernalia of war-lay scattered in oee wild welter. Foe grasped foe for the death- : struggle, and together fell clenched in each other's gripe, while their pallid faces wore the look of deadly hate which had filled their hearts in life. Three days of the most desperate fighting the world has ever I : known, had passed. The little garrison, completely overcome, lay :j asleep on the cold frozen earth. Men dropped from their position ji while standing, unable to bear up any longer under their dread : exhaustion. Some of the little band had fallen on the ensanguined .' field, others were prostrated through fatigue and exposure. All : weary and fainting, yet they never dreamed of yielding. They : looked to the morrow for a renewal of the fight. Alasl they  S dreamed not of the humiliating fate that awaited them. Again in council sat the officers, this time more grave, more thoughtful than before., Death or surrender .was now the choice. There was nothing else left them. Each of the three generals, Floyd, Pillow, and Buckner, had expressed his respective opinion. They were found to differ- a General Pillow believing it yet! possible to cut their way out- General Buckner demurring, regarding the project as one involv- ing extreme hazard and a useless sacrifice of life. Silence ensued. A scout was ushered in.       .         .   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         67 "The enelny reoccupies the lines from which we drove him during the day." "I think the man must be inistaken," said General Pillow. '"Send out another scout." "I aim confident the enemy will attack my lines by light, and, g owing to the condition of my men, I cannot hold them a half hour," said Generdal Buckn'er. "Why so? Why so, general?" interrogated General Pillow, sharply.    I "Because I can bring into action not over four thousand men, and they demoralized by long and uninterrupted exposure and hard fighting, while he can bring large numbers of fresh troops to the attack." 'i I differ with you, general," responded Pillow, nervously. 't I ithink you can hold your lines. I think you can, sir." ' I know my position," firmly answered General Buckner. "I ,know the lines cannot be held by my troops, in their present con- dition." "Then," interposed General Floyd, "a capitulation is all that is, left us." "I do not think so," was the quick response of General Pillowy  "At any rate, we can cut our way out." "To cut our way out would Aqst us three-fourths of our men, even if we should succeed at all; and ,I do not think any com- mander has a right to sacrifice three-fourths of his command- to save one-fourth," responded the noble Buckner. The second scout entered the room. "The enemy completely surround us. Our works are fully invested." "Send out scouts to see if the back water can be passed by the army."                         " The command was immediately obeyed, two of Colonel Forrest's cavalry being dispatched for that purpose. Soon they return, and report, "Cavalry can pass--infantry can- not."  '( Well, gentlemen, what arewe to do?" asked General Buckner, on the reception of this intelligence. "Understand me, gentlemen," responded General Pillow, "I am for holding out at least a day longer-getting boats, and crossing the command jover the river. As for myself, I will never sur- render, I will die first." "Nor will I," interposed General Floyd. "I cannot and will     68        RAIDS AND ROMANCE not surrender; but, I must confess, personal reasons control mle." "But such considerations should never control a general's ac- tions," responded the heroic Buckner. "I see nothing that can be done but to yield the comlnnand and the position. It is humil- iating, it is true, deeply humiliating, to be driven to surrender to such a foe; but as we are, unfortunately, placed in a position where all the dictates of humanity require it, it is best, in my judgment, that it should be done." "I shall never surrender, General Buckner," responded Gen- i eral Pillow, warmly. "I go out firom here a free man, or die   where I stand. I shall surrender to Grant neither the command . "nor myself." General Buckner sat calm, grave, thoughtful. He had been  [ overruled in his decision. Should he fall into the hands of the hated foe, he had more to meet, perhaps, than either of the other ( commanders. He knew the sword of vengeance had been whetted : against him by his enemies at home, who stood ready, whenever he should fall into their power, to lead him to the block. He could i hope for no clemency at their hands. They had denounced hiln as a- "base traitor," a seducer of the young, a "felon, whose only : doom should be the gallows." He. knew that scorn and contempt J:i would-be heaped upon hin ; that he would be made the butt of ridicule and low jest; would be inveighed against ,by the press of ' his own city, and held up to his fellow-men as a wretch whose h3 crime merited the most ignominious punishment. All this he  i? knew, and as a brave, honorable man, he felt that to die would be .- naught compared with' a fate like this. But there were his brave ; e men around hiln.                  , they had fought with a daring never surpassed. He thought of their wives and parents, many of whom were personally known  a   to him. i Must he sacrifice them to spare himself this deep abase- ' mnent? No! no!! He would save his menfrom death, and share their fate. Thrice noble man'! Among the honorable names which shall make the page of our history illustrious, there will stand none more glorious than that of the hero of DI)onelson-the truly brave, the sublimely heroic Buckner. "You have decided against me, gentlemen, and I do not wish to seem to oppose you; but y judgmnent is unalterably against your proposition. I cannot consent to sacrifice my men in this fearful experiment."        ,  ".Will you take command, General Buckner, and release us?" i   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.          69 asked General Floyd of hirn. "If you decide to remain, and will l surrender the fort, I will pass the command to you through Gen- eral- Pillow. I anl unyielding in my purpose to go out, let it cost what it may." General Buckner expressed his willingness to accept the com- mand. General Floyd said, "I turn over the comrnnland.1" ;'I pass it. I will not surrender," responded General Pillow, quickly. General Buckner iinmediately called for pen, ink, paper, and a bugler. "Well, general, will I be permitted to take my brigade out, if   ) I can?" interrogated General Floyd. "Certainly; if you can get them out before the, terms of capitu- lation are agreed on," was the reply. Tje two generals made what hurried preparations were neces- sary, and gathering together as many of their command aS was possible, left the fort; and when daylight came they were beyond the reach of the enemy. General Buckner immediately sent a flag of truce to General Grant, bearing the following proposition: C HEADQ-UARTERS, FORT DONELSON, Feb. 16th, 1862. "SIR :-In consideration of all the circumstances governing the present situation of affairs at this station, I propose to the conm- manding officer of the Federal forces the appointment of commis- sioners to agree upon terms of capitulation of the forces and fort under nmy-command, and in that view suggest an armistice until 12 o'clock to-day." To which Grant replied in the following terms, alike unworthy of a gentleman and an officer:              ! "SIR:-Yours' of this date, proposing an armistice and appoint- ment of bommissioners to settle terms of capitulation, is just re- ceived. "No terms, except unconditional and immediate surrender, can be accepted. I propose to tnove imlndiately on your works." To which General Buckner responded:     70     -    RAIDS AND ROMANCE t SIR: -The distribution of the forces under my command, inci. dent to an unexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelm- ing force under your command, compel Ine, notwithstanding the brilliant success of the Confederate arms yedterday, to accept the ungenerous, unchivalrous terms which you propose." /           i   OF MORGAN AND HAIS MEN.         71 CHAPTER XIL THE SURRENDER. WEARY men slept on, all unconscious of the dreadful fate that awaited them. They were dreaming of the battle-field and of victory. Mo(rning came. The black leaden clouds of winter hung like a dark funeral pall over the doomed fort. All was still as grim deatlh, who held his dread and Silent banquet over the gory battle- field.        / The reveille was sounded. Men arose from their death-like sleep and grasped their arms, to rush to the contest. But no sound of booming canno  ni met their ear, no warlike movements greeted their eye. Whlat did all this mean? Had the enemy, foiled in his attempt, withdrawn? Surely this must be so, else whly this silent apathy? They look out through the gray mists, and there, waving in the morning light, is the white flag of surrender. Soon the dreadful intelligence runs through the ianks. They are the prisoners of the hated foe. Never, never will they submit to this ignominy. Sooner shall, their own swords drink their life-blood, than they become the scoff and butt of Yankee vengeance. The whole gar- rison was moved as one man to oppose this shameful fate. Some cursed the treachery of their commanders. . Others swore to be re- venged on those who had sacrificed them. Some sat sad and de- jected, stupified by the stunning blow, while many a stout man wept like an infant, when he read his humiliating doom. Resistance Awas useless now. The die was cast. On came the Yankee conquerors. Strains of, martial music heralded their ap- proach.  Silent in his tent sat General Buckner. His tried and faithful staff vere around himn.' They truly sympathized with hiin, but they, knew the vanity of words in such a trial as this, and they attempted no consolation. Each fully approved of his course in the surrender. They knew it,was all he could do, and every man X              , i     72        RAIDS AND ROMANCE expressed himself ready to share his leader's fate, let it be what- ever it might. Every tling in the fort was taken possession of by the Victors, even the private baggage of, the soldiers. The Yankee general, Grant, issued orders to the garrison to be ready for transportation to Northern camps. Charley-as all of his Kentucky copatriots---had fought gal- lantly under the leadership of the daring Hansln. Exhausted, trembling in every nerve with fatigue and cold, lie and young Lawrence sat beside each other, stupified under the consciousness of being captives in the hanlds of the Yankees. Silently they ob- served the movements of the victors, as they passed from group to group, demanding the surrender of the prisoners' armlls. '4I have fought for three days, I John; I have slept in those muddy trenches, exposed to driving snow and sleet; have gone without a mouthful of food for twenty-four hours; my feet are frost-bitten, and my clothes are frozen on me, but I would rather endure all--this a thousand times overi than to go to one of those Yankee prisons." "And so would I, Charley. But what can we do? We cannot - lelp ourselves. It's all that is left us now. Look at that das- tardly pack of thieves. See, they are demanding Bob's mnoney. They h1ave taken his arms from him, and now they will rob lim l. But he'll not give it up. Listen, he is cursing theln; and see, they cower before him-and two to one-and he a prisoner with- A out arms.":'                 i a Let's break our guns, Joln. I can never yield i ine to the wretches. I feel it would be-an eternal disgrace." "Agreed, Charley. But we'll have to be quick about it. They'll be upon us directly." The two stepped behind a tent, and battering their arms as well as they could, threw them into a ditch. "There," said John, as he dashed his into the mud with all his might, "I am saved that humiliation, anyhow. And if one of the cowardly thieves dales to insult me, I'll knock him over, if he shoots me for it the next minute." t"I could bear this thing better, John, if it were not for mother. You know how bitterly she opposed my coming to the army, and I know she will be frantic when she hears I am a prisoner. I believe I'll try to escape. It may be that t can overtake those, men who went out early this morning." "Good," answered John, ; let's try it. We can get beyond .the   OFP OR  A   AND HS SEN.       73 intrenchments and secrete ourselves until the army leaves here, and maybe we can reach some friendly house where we can get shelter until we rest and recruit. I don't believe I can live twenty-four hours longer in this condition." The two took from their haversacks the morsel of bread they contained, and, having carefully looked around them toi see if danger was near, thly, under cover of the tents, passed the last trench and set out on their proposed plan of escape. 1   ,     74  S' , '   RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER   XIII. REMOVAL TO PRISON. As stealthily as tey could, avoiding every appearance of dn- gr, the two youn soldiers moved on until they had placed a slight elevation between their position and the fort. Just before them was some underbrush. If they could but, reach it, they would be safe. They paused and looked around, to see if any one was in view. No one;was near enough to watch their move- ments. Quickening their pace into a run, they sprang forward towards the covert. Like men running forlife, they bouded ward, every muscle strained for the race. They had almost gained it, when suddenly a coarse voice called out, "Halt or I'll shoot you." At the same time a squad of Lin- coln soldiers appeared, emerging from the bushers. Resistance Would have been folly; they were outnumbered, four to one. To attempt to elude their captors was impossible. There was nothing left them but to obey the command. With loud oaths and fiendish imprecations they were immedi- ately marched back to the fort; from thence to the river, where. boats were in waiting to transport the prisoners to their destina- tion. Oharley and his friend, young Lawrence, were placed on the same vessel with General Buckner, his staff, and the IKentucky officers. In this they regarded themselves most fortunate, for many of the Second Kentucky were hurried into other boats.. Tile prisoners were taken from the fort to Cairo. From there they were shipped by river and railway to other. points. Some were sent to St. Louis, others to Alton, some to Iamp Qduglas, some to Camp Butler, while others were forwarded by the Ohio river to Jeffersonville, on their route to Camp Chase. Subjected to 'very insult, treated as if they had been brutes, rather than me these noble patriots, who had won for themselves imperish- able fames were hurried by their vengeful captors to their various places of i0wprisonment. Wholly ununiformed, their clothtes torn plc, of 'i            'lomnt  h1l    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         75 in the desperate fight, and begrimed with mud alnd powder; their coverings of every conceivable character-blanlkets of all colors, shawls of every variety, carpets of various patterns-these heroes of Donelson indeed presented a sad and touching spectacle. And yet such was the brutality and heartlessness-such the entire destitution of "every emotion of humanity in the hearts of these vulgar, sunken wretches, that they jeered and scoffed, and witt low and cruel mockery taunted their helpless prisoners. But helpless as they were in the hands of a base and inhuman foe, in garb looking worse by far than their slaves at home on their plant- ations, they nevertheless remembered they were born freemen, and on every occasion they hurled back with defiant scorn the ruthless jests of their coarse and ill-bred assailants. Never, perhaps, did the superior nobility of the Southern char- acter speak out in more striking contrast to the natural coarseness and heartlessness of their vulgar foe, than on this memorable oc- casion. General Buckner and staff, the officerg and some of the men of the Second Kentucky, were sent from Paducah on board a steamer to Jeffersonville, Indiana. Among the privates who were forwarded by this route were Charley, young Lawrence, and another Kentuckian named Bob Reed. "I wonder if it is possible they will allow us to land .atLouis- ville," said Charley to his friend, as the two stood shivering with cold on the upper deck of the boat. I do believe they will be afraid to do so, lest there should be some demonstration in our favor." "Why, Charley, it is a LOYAL city. There are no traitors there to make any manifestation of sympathy for such poor, miserable wretches as we are," replied young Lawrence, ironically.  "Could the Southern men of Louisville once catch a glimpse of General Buckner, and know for a moment what shameful humili- ation he has to endure at the hands of these wretches, they would rescue him from their clutches, if it cost them their lives.- I do hope they will land us there, if it be but for a few minutes. I know there will be crowds of friends to welcome and cheer us; Ibut I fear our enemies will not be thus kind to us. It would de- light them to tantalize Buckner, Cassidy, Johnson, Colonel Han- son, and all of us, by giving us only a farewell glimpse of our be- loved city." As old memories, sacred and dear, rushed to Oharley's mind,     76        RIDS AND ROMANCE he wept. It was the first time he had shed a tear siace he had fallen into the hands of the victors. "I am unmanned," said Charley, recovering hifself, after a few moments ; " but I cannot help it, John. I dread the idea of im- prisonment for this war.' I would a thousand times rather take my chance on the battle-field. And to think I shall pass so near my parents and sisters, and yet not be permitted to see them I It makes mpe a child, John." Ah, adid there was another whose name our young hero dared not mention. What joy it would have given him could he have felt assuied that even for one short moment he should behold that dear being-should catch from those cherished lips one word, or from those soft, blue eyes, so full of tender affection, one look of love. i Great Iwas the excitement in Louisville when it was known that the boat bearing General Buckner, his staff, and the Kentucky prisoners would reach the wharf that day. The "Daily Journal," in each issue since the fall of Donelson, had heaped upon General Buckner every abuse that its vindictive partisan editor could conceive. Every opprobrious epithet that the language could afford-oftentimes of the most indelicate nature- had been employed to make, if possible, his honorable name odiqus. Every species of torture that the fiendish brain of Prentice could invent had been proposed to be inflicted upon him by the citizMns of is own town. He had been called infamous wretch," 'vile seducer of the young men of Kentucky," "hellish murderer of the husbands and sons-of his neighbors," "double-dyed traitor to his government and State," fiend," " assassin," " brute." This Con- necticut-reared editor had said he ought to suffer, if possible, a thousand deaths on the gallows, to expiate his crime. He also proposed that '"he should be shown through the city in a cage, and that loyal men and women should torture hin with red- hot pincers;" that he should be doomej to a felon's cell, and there shut out from the light of day, be fed on bread and water until death should come to end his " infamous life."  As might be expected, such, things had wrought on the fierce passions of the mob until it was wild with vengeance. Threats were everywhere uttered against the distinguished prisoner. But General Buckner had many warm friends in Louisville, men if true courage and high-toned honor, who would at any moment have sacrificed their lives rather than he should have been sub- jected to public scorn. This the cowardly editor and the hireling   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         7 officials knew. And while they boasted great contempt for the prisoner and his cause, they secretly feared the influence of one and respected the other. And while through the medium of their perverted press they were deriding and abusing him, in private caucus, where the subject was seriously discussed, they decided it would not be safe to suffer the boat to land, lest there should be some overwhelming manifestation of respect and admiration for the patriot and his fellow-prisoners. The boat was nearing the city. It was believed, by those on board, that she would touch at the wharf. Their hearts leaped with wild emotion as her turrets and spires, so familiar, shot up before their eager, longing gaze. The boat ploughed on against the current. Nearer and nearer they approached the city. With folded arms and proud and noble iffien, General Buckner stood on deck, his staff around him. Never did men more bespeak the majesty of iconscious right than did that silent group, as they stood there, triumphant in their defeat, sublimely strong in their appa- rent weakness. They were stigmatized by their deluded, vindic- tive countrymen as traitors; they had been the recipients of every abuse and insult, the objects of malignant hate and contemptuous scorn. They were prisoners in the hands of a cruel and unprin- cipled foe. Their doom they knew would be fearful-perhaps life- long imprisonment-perhaps a violent death. Should the cause they had espoused fail to succeed, in all future history their names would be handed down to posterity covered with infamy. This was the bitterest thought of all. To an honorable man, disgrace is more dreadful far than direst pangs of death. Motionless and pale with anxiety, Charley stood leaning on the railing. He was alone, busy with his own thoughts, which, to him, were too sacred for the intrusion of his dearest friend. Port- land was passed, and the lower wharf of the city reached, yet the boat kept steadily on her course. No signs of landing were to be observed. His heart beat wildly with alternate hope and fear. He bent eagerly forward, and strained his gaze to catch a glimpse of old} familiamobjectsi The boat veered to the right, as if seek- ing the shore. Oh! how his pulses leaped! His heart quickened its throbbings; tears he could not suppress rushed to his eyes. If he could but see some dear, remembered face; grasp, even for a moment, some kindly hand; hear the tones of sorhe familiar voice; it would sweeten the bitter cup, gild the rayless gloom., It was a moment of torturing suspense. Street after street is passed, the wharf is in sight; yet the boat moves not from its forward     78          MsIDS AND ROMNCE course. The landing is filled with spectators of all classes, from the sad, sympathizing friend, to the vicious Yankee and idly-gaz- ing negro. His look strains itself as it wanders from grohtp to group, searching for some one he knows. Will not some kindly eye see him? shall he not receive some token of recognition? Surely, there must be some one in that vast assemblage who knowsJhim--some well-remembered face that he will soon descry. ,But not a voice is heard, not a handkerchief waved. As fades away the brilliant mirage of the desert before the charmed gaze, and leaves behind but wild wastes and burning sands Ato mock the eye of the worn traveller, so died away the high and cherished hopes of the heart-sick soldier-boy, and naught remained to him but disappointment anld bitter tears. The crowd stands motionless, gazing on the scene. The prisoners stand motionless, gazing on the crowd. The boat keeps on-on- the last faint hope is gone, and Charley's heart, strained with anxious desire almost to bursting, sinks, dies; and like the orphan child who sits itself down to weep under its crushing sense of loneliness, so the sad, disappointed prisoner, burying his face in his trembling hands, wept bitterly. The boat landed on the opposite shore, at Jeffersonville. The prisoners were hurried from the boat to the depot, where the cars were under steam to carry them to Columbus, Ohio. As they were driven along, friends from Kentucky line either side of the way. Only a look of recognition, a low-spoken word of sympathy, perhaps a nervous shake of the hand, as some loving heart ejacu- lates a "God bless and protect you." This is aUl that is permitted. As Charley was waiting his turn to ascend the steps of the car, he heard his name pronounced in a soft, low voice. He started, and looked round. There stood Lu and Mary. He sprang towards them. The guard seized and drew him back to his position, not, however, before he had received the package which his sister held out to him. A moment more, and he was rudely thrust forward, and had gained the car. Through the open window he gazed into the seething mass before him. But vainly. Lu and Mary could not be seen. They were lost in the crowd. '-' ^   ...        OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         79 CHAPTER XIV. CAMP CHASE. WHAT a thrill of horror seizes the soul as this dreadful name meets the earl Synonym of injustice, cruelty, and suffering, how black will be thy calendar of crimes, when portrayed by the pen of impartial history to the gaze of an astonished world I Thy record has gone up before the tribunal of eternal, immutable jus- tice, and fearful must be the doom that awaits the authors and abettors of thy deep, dark wrongs. The prisoners were marched immediately 'from Columbus to Camp Chase, a distance of six miles, without a moment's pause for rest, which they so greatly needed. Like herded swine, they were driven into this filthy inclosure, there to remain through long months of dreary suffering, deprived of every thing like com- fort or cleanliness, subjected to neglect and coarse insult, and in many instances to violent death at the hands of their brutal guard. The members of General Buckner's staff, and all the officers of Colonel Hanson's regiment, were detained here untilarrangements could be completed to transfer them to Johnson's Island, in the bay of Sandusky. With studied cruelty the officers were prohibited from inter- course with their men, lest their influence might serve to cheer and console them under their horrible treatment. It was hoped that this measure might serve to intimidate the private sldiers, and finally force them to take the oath. But how mistaken were all such calculations I The men were actuated by the saml J igh and patriotic principles that filled the bosoms of their leaders, and were just as determined as they, to brave death rather than sub- mit to disgrace. It was a loathsome, disgusting place, unfit for the abode of the most wretched criminals. Filled with every species. of offensive vermin, the mud knee-deep, in which the men had to stand like beasts in the stall, with no room for exercise by day, and nothing     80        RAIDS AND ROMANCE but the bare floor ofan open plank shanty, through which the bleak winds and driving snows had free access, to sleep on at night; their disgusting food doled out to them in such scant measure as wholly to fail to meet the actual demands of nature; without medicines or nurses for the sick; could it be expected that these weary, half-clad men could do otherwise than die by scores? And, indeed, was not death a sweet relief to an honora- ble heart under such sad trials? The men, in solemn vow, pledged themselves to stand by their officers and each other to the last extremity. Although separated from their officers, and all conversation with them prohibited, they swore to avenge with their own blood any insult that might be offered to them. Men and officers were alike treated as if they had been felons of the lowest grade, the steadiest watch exercised over them by the low, base minions of an unprincipled 'tyrant; subject at any moment to be shot or bayoneted by these infidel hirelings, yet they never for a moment lost the consciousness of their superiority, and of the righteousness of their cause, and never would they cower before insolence or insult. Such was their noble bearing, such their dignity, that even the stolid hearts of their guard were moved with respect and admiration. A few days passed, when suddenly, and wholly unexpected, Major Cassidy was taken sick. This officer, of General Buckner's staff, was a son of one of the oldest and most highly respectable citizens of Louisville. His father, having located in the place before it was yet fully redeemed from the swamps and malaria which made its first settlement so dangerous to life, had amassed a princely fortune. His sons had, from their earliest childhood, been the recipients of all the advantages of education and society that such immense wealth could afford. Major Cassidy was a husband and father, surrounded by all the tender endearments of home. But when the call came to Kentucky's noble sons to arm themselves in defence of liberty and right, he girded on his sword, and bidding farewell to loving wife, prattling children, and gray- haired sire, he nobly went forth to link himself with the cause of the South. He was with General Buckner while at Bowling Green, at Russellville, at Donelson, and in that fearful defeat decided to remain beside him, and share with him his captivity, rather than desert his general and his friend in the hour of overthrow and gloom. And now he was a prisoner, receiving with the others all the insult and trial that malice and fiendishness could,heap upon him.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         81 Rapidly he grew worse. At the earnest solicitations of his brother officers, a dispatch was sent to his friends in Louisville, apprising them of his illness. But his disease quickly ran its course, and befor his aged father and young and loving wife could reach him, he was dead. This was the first death among the officers. Its suddenness and mysteriousness gave rise to suspicions of 0oul play. It was said he had died from congestion, but there lurked in many a mind  dark misgivings as to the truth of the statement. The body was placed in a metallic case. FewOof the men were permitted to gaze on the noble form now still in death. They could only watch it from afar, as it passed through the outer gate on its way to its last resting-place. Each day new accessions were made to the already large num- ber of prisoners from among the citizens of Kentucky who were suspected df Southern sympathies. No age nor condition in life was free from the tyranny of arbitrary arrest. Old, gray-haired men with tottering limbs, borne down with the infirmities of age, without any accusation against them save the general charge ot disloyalty, were snatched from their homes and families by a ruffianly soldiery, and without a moment's preparation-in many instances not even permitted to bid farewell to their wives and children-were hurried off, frequently at the hour of midnight, transferred across the river, and incarcerated in this noisome prison. Young men, on whom depended the support of their helpless families, as they went about their daily avocations, met the bayonet pointed to their bosoms, and found themselves pris- oners in the hands of ignorant Irish and Dutch Lincolnites, who cared no more about the Constitution and the laws, inwhose name and by whose authority they claimed a right to practise their outrages, than did the perjured tyrants at Washington. No class of society was exempt. The learned and unlearned, old and young, the honorable and the obscure-even ministers of the gospel-all alike were the victims of relentless hate and cru- elty. Will there not be a day of reckoning for all these deep, dark wrongs, and will it not come speedily? Already theq throne of the tyrant begins to totter; already, too, his unprincipled and debased tools begin to feel the coming storm of wrath which most surely will sweep them before it to ruin-fearful, irremedia- ble. An oppressed and outraged people will riSe to avenge the high-handed abuses that have been heaped upon them by a base abolition usurpation. And when this hour comes, and come it 4*      82        RAMDS AND ROMANCE must, for justice, though long delayed, will surely overtake he transgressor, ah, will it not be one of fearful moment? After a few weeks more, in order to effectually remove the in- fluence of the officers from their men, the former were transferred to Johnson's Island. The men were left in their loathsome con- finement. The daily round of life was but little varied. Now a familiar face would be missed-a few days more, and a plain pine coffin bore the body to the burial-place. Then a fellow-pr'soner, for some imagined offence to the guard, was shot down-before the eyes of his friends. Then would the demon of revenge take possession of the men's hearts, and solemn vows, muttered through clenched teeth, would go up before heaven, to wipe out the shame- ful crime. As the spring went by, the character of the prison ground, which was a low, wet swanp, somewhat improved, and the men, to relieve the tediousness of the weary hours, would sometimes in- dulge in a game of ball, and other such athletic exercises as their limited space would allow. For two months Charley, with such of his companions as had survived the hardships and deprivations of that horrid prison, had suffered on without one ray of hope. They saw nothing before them but years of close confinement, with all its attendants of in- sult, want, and ennui. The oppressive tedium was sometimes relieved by the presence of a visitor, soinetimes by the reception of a letter from absent friends, at others, by the arrival of a me- mento of love and affection in the form of a box of nice clothes and delicacies. But, oh, it was an irksome existence to men of spirit and daring. I         .I It was in the middle of April. The sun shone brightly down from the clear blue heavens, as if in mockery of the wretched scene beneath. Charley; leaning against a tree that marked the beat of the guard, stood reading a letter from home. He turned the page, and there met his eyes a pressed rose-bud, and written in his sisteris own sweet hand, these words: "This is sent you by Mary, Charlev."                i Our young hero's face brightened into a high flush as he read again and again the charmed line. His heart quickened its beat- ings, his eyes swain with tears. "Why, you appear distressed, Charley,"' said young Reed to- him, as walking by ne observed his deep emotion. "Is any thing wrong at home, my boy, or are you so glad to get a letter thAt you can't help shedding a tear over it?" o    w        I   OF MORGAN AND HS MLEN.         83 "Nothing serious, Bob. It is a letter from my sister Lu. [ I am so overjoyed to hear from my friends. that I could not refrain a slight manifestation of weakness. It is the first I have had for six weeks. And my sister writes, jestingly, of course, that we may look for her soon to make us a visit." "DQges she mention my sister, Charley?" said John, who at this moment joined the two. "I do wish she would come with Miss Lu." Charley endeavored to conceal his deep-feelings at the mention of Mary's namae. He did not wish to prevaricate, and yet he felt unwilling, in the presence of Robert, to disclose the message. Yes," he answered, after some hesitation, which seemed to arouse the young men's curiosity. "Lu says perhaps your sister will accompany her. But, of course, John, the girls must be quizzing us. They cannot seriously contemplate suchi a thing." "Oh, if Mary has any such idea ia her head, she will as certainly. make us a visit as that I shall shoot that cursed Dutchman yonder, if ever I have a chance. And you know, boys, that I have sworn by the eternal heavens to do this. I tell you, if my sister has made up her mind fo it, she will carry it through at all risks. I dol hlope she hlas determined to come. I would rather see her than anybody in the world. You do not know her, Bob. I believe she is the sweetest creature living. Ain't she, Charley?" "Certainly, John," replied the young soldier, with quite a flip- pant malnner, that he might avoid suspicion. "Miss Mary is quite a charming young lady." "Three cheers for Kentucky and her lovely girls," and John took off his ragged beaver and tossed it high up in the air. Threie times three," responded his friends. "Come, Charley, finish your letter, my boy, and give us all the news. You are selfish. When I received the letter from Mary, I read it aloud to all the Kentucky boys, and they enjoyed it as much as I did. What's the- matter? I do believe you hade got some secret, you blush so. Well, Bob, we'll give him time to read his letter, while we walk - round a little. We'll be back this way, after a few minutes, to hear the news. We mustn't be disap- pointed, you understand."  The two passed on, and in a little while were back again.     "' What news, Charley?" asked John, walking up and putting his arm in his for a stroll. "All well, I hope."  "Yes. The only news item is the proposed visit of our sisters, and this is so vaguely expressed, that I am not sure I have rightly     84    -    RAIDS AND ROMANCE interpreted Lu's ambiguous language. So we must not too san- guinely anticipate the happiness."         I The three passed on. Charley was silent. They continued walking for some time to and fro in the space allotted for their, exercise. "Why are you so mumn, Charley, my boy?" said John, with- drawing his hand and slapping himn on the shoulder.! 'Some- thing's wrong with you. You act so mysteriously. Come, Bob, let's besiege him until we rally his spirits." "No need of that, John. I'll tell you and Bob all about it, but you must guard my secret as you would your own life, boys. Should I be betrayed, I dare not think of the result. We must speak low, the guard might overhear us. Come aside by this house. We will be free from notice there." The three stepped aside, and reached a secluded spot. 'Seating himself between them, Charley undertook to unfold his secret. "I have been thinking for several days of proposing to you to escape. I cannot stand this life much longer. I would rather die. And this-letter from home, together with the shocking death of that young Virginian, has determined me in my purpose. What say you, boys, will you risk it?" "Wasn't that a brutal murder," interrupted young Lawrence, "to shoot-that poor fellow through the heart, just because he.- accidentally, and in play, crossed the beat? And that poor mnan, who was shot by that Dutch scoundrel last week, merely because he carelessly threw out his arm in the rascal's way. Oh 1 I tell you, boys, I want to kill every one of them, froln Abe Lincoln down to that old fool, Dick, that swaggers around here, with not sense enough to know how to carry his gun. Never mind; if I ever get out of this infernal place, I'll avenge all the murders that have been committed here. I here swear, boys, eternal hate to r the Yankees." "Amen and amen," responded his companions. "But, tell me, Charley," resumed his friend, "have you de- cided on atny plan? Will you bribe the guard, or try to get out secretly?" "Secretly, of course. I would never trust those wretches; and then, besides, I have no money. You know they robbed me of it, and they have never allowed me but two dollars at a time since, of all the money father has sent me." "They are nothing but thieves and murderers, the best of them, Charley. But never mind, the day will -soon come when we'll   OF MXrGAN AND HS ME';.        85 pay off the reckoning. I tell you, I'll never be surrendered again. I do wish to get out of this infernal place, if it is for nothing more than to shoot the Yankees. However, boys, we settled this score with theme at Donelson. We swept them down there by hundreds. But tell us, what about getting out? I will share your fate. If you can go, so can I. Bob, what say you? Are you willing to risk the thing?" ' Yes, Johp, if the plan is at all -feasible, I am ready to under- take it with you and Charley." "I have no settled plan, boys. Several have passed through my mind, but there are difficulties in the way of them all which I do not know how to overcome. We must not go before our sis- ters come. But hush, boys; see that g ard yonder I he's watch-  ing us. We'll meet again." / I    . I    I e           I?     86        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER XV. THE VISIT OF THE NUNS.  Busy were the minds of the prisoners that night in their endeav- ors to hit upon some practicable method of 'escape. Long after the hour of midnight, Charley was canvassing the subject with deep and earnest thought. No scheme suggested itself that was 4 not attended with'great difficulties. Even should they succeed in clearing the prison walls, what would they do in a strange and hostile country, with enemies on every side? And should they be overtaken, how greatly would their sufferings be increased! But some risk must be run. Surely the object to be secured was worth the hazard. Thus soliloquized Charley to himself, as he tossed on his hard plank bed. But after hours of feverish thought he could decide upon no plan that appeared to him 'feasible. And he fell into a disturbed sleep, his brain haunted with visions of attempted escape, arrest, bayonets, and death. No opportunity presented itself during the following morning for consultation. The meeting must seem accidental, otherwise suspicion would be aroused. The boys were several times to- gether, but always in presence of the guard, or their fellow-pris- oners.  Charley and John were busily engaged in a game of ball near the entrance of the inclosure, when their attention was suddenly arrested by the appearance of two nuns, who, escorted by the captain of the guard, stood near the plank gateway. Each nun bore a basket on her arm, and a small package in ier hand. The players paused a moment to observe them, but s such visitors were by no means unusual, they resumed again the game. The officer, after having shown the sisters in, left them to pursue their mission of charity unattended. The two females were clad in deep mourning. Their closely fitting bonpets completely shielded their faces. Timidly they moved alohg towards the play-grou d. Bowing to the guard, and handing him a tract, they procee ed hesitatingly towards the prisoners ii front of them.  ,i   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         87 As they approached, the men left off their game to receive them. "Sore more of the sanctimonious sisters, with their little tracts," said John to a young Mississippian by his side. "They are very anxious indeed about our souls, the hypocrites. I wish they would manifest a more tender regard for our bodies. I think we have done penance enough since we came to this place to atone for all past sins. I don't see what more the veriest saint among them could require at our hands. For my part, I am tired to death of their little books, and their holy advice, and I'll end the matter forthwith this time, by distributing the tracts myself. See how gallantly I'll relieve them of their business, boys," and off the young man hastened on his self-imposed mission, to the great amusement of his comrades, who quit their play for the moment to note his success. As he neared where the two females stood, he observed the half- raised basket-lid fall from the hand of one of them, who fixed her eyes intently upon him. He felt rather abashed to meet her ear- nest look, but he had undertaken his work, and would not be thwarted. He knew his companions were observing him. "Good-morning, ladies," he said, at the same time bowing very cavalierly, and tipping his ragged beaver. "Have you any re- ligious books for us poor sinners this morning? We stand sadly in need of your tracts, good sisters, and are most happy to see that you take such an interest in our spiritual welfare. There are but few who seem to care for us poor rebels. But let-me relieve you of the very unpleasant task of going round to distribute your books among all these graceless sinners. Just hand them to me. I assure you it will give me the greatest happiness to aid you in your good work," and he extended his hand to receive the pack- ages. One of the nuns grasped it nervously. He started back amazed. * "John, don't you know me-Mary, your sister? But hush! for your life don't betray us! We have risked every thing to see you." The boys, who had been remarking his gallant air, at this junc- ture burst into a merry laugh. "Served him right!" "served him right!" exclaimed several of them. "He should have left the holy sisters alone, to pursue their labor of love. Wasn't he taken back?" and a loud laugh rang out from the amused be- holders.  Our hero stood for a few moments perfectly bewildered. lie     88        RAIDS AND ROMANCE could not tell what to think of this strange incident. Could it really be Mary? or was some one trying to deceive him? The young nun looked hastily around at the guard, and seeing that he was intent on the tract she had just handed him, she stepped for- ward to the young man, lifted her bonnet, and threw back the snowy frill of her muslin cap. The dark, auburn ringlets escaped from their hiding, and fell over the beautiful brow. John was convinced-petrified. He could scarcely credit his senses. "Mary! Mary!' he exclaimed. "How on earth came you here?" "Hus;, John, hush, I tell you! We'll be arrested and sent away to dungeon. Can't you take us to some spot where we won't be observed?" 'Anywhere, so that we'll be removed from the eye of the guard. So here is Charley. He must come with you." "Wherle is he--my brother?" asked the sister nervously, speed- ing from the door.  Quick as thought the prisoner eomprehended the whole position. He must be calm, or every thing would be lost. The game must be played, and played successfully. Commanding himself, he took a tract from his sister Mary's basket, and slowly turned the leaves, as! if closely exaipining the little work. "Your brother is with that group to our right, Miss Lu, but you cannot speak to him now. The prisoners must not know who you are. It might lead to trouble." "But I can see him, can't I?" asked the jbung girl, eagerly. "I cannot leave this place until I do." \  "You 'hall see him, if possible. But we shall have to be very careful. If you and Maiy are discovered, you will certainly be arrested, and perhaps ilnprisoned." He mused for a moment, in deep thought, then looking up, he said:  "Do you see that house to the left? You two pass on towards that, give pamphlets to-the prisoners as you go, and I will get Charley and join you directly. There we will be safe to say what we please. But give me some tracts to hand to the boys here- that will divert their attention from us." The two nuns passed on as directed. John took his tracts and returned to the group.  "Why didn't you relieve the sisters of their mission, John?" the boys asked,' laughing, and taunting at his failure. "Your gallantry died out in their presence." [                         -   [   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.       i 89 "Oh, they are righteous overmuch, boys-hope to get tq heaven on their good deeds-and attach great virtue to distribu- ting their pamphlets. I soon saw they were bent on their pur- pose, and it was no use for me to offer service. But I succeeded in getting these. Come, poor rebels, learn to do right from these holy books," and saying this, he took the wrapper off and handed them round.  "Here, Charley, my boy, here is one that just suits our case. Throw down your bandy, and let's read it. I don't believe you want to learn your duty. Oh, what a wretched sinner you are!" "I'm tired to death, John, of these Catholic books. I'm a Prot- estant, and don't believe one word'in their holy water, and pen- ance, and purgatory, and saints. I am just as good as any of them, and I don't intend to bother my head with them any longer." "But this doesn't say a word about saints and crucifixes. It is an appeal to sinners, and you know you are one. Here, lo6k at this first page," and John whispered a word into his ear as he stood beside him. ' Are you not convinced? Come, let's go and read it." The two set outtowards the low, wooden house. "Hold there, buys," called out Bob, who supposed they were going apart for consultation; "wait, and I'll go with you. I'm a sinner, too, and may be your book will do me good." Joining his friends, he proceeded with them towards the house.  He was hurriedly initiated into the secret as they passed along. The two nujs were overtaken just as they reached the door of the building.  "Here, this door, Mary," and the two brothers entered quickly,  followed by the sisters, while Bob lingered outside to look out for any danger. With difficulty Charley mastered his emotion as he beheld the face of his sister and that of Mary. He scarcely knew how to con- duct himself, his surprise and joy were so great. But he must not yield to his emotions-the time was short, and he had much to say. Mutual surprise and embarrassment were soon succeeded by i pleasant and joyous conversation. Kind'inquiries were made for friends and acquaintances, an'many questions asked about the changes that had taken place in the city since the young men left it. The fight at Donelson was graphically described to the sisters, ,'      90        RAIDS AND ROMANCE and some of the horrors of their two months' imprisonment por- trayed to their shuddering hearts. "But, Charley, why don't you get put of this wretched place?" asked his sister Lu, with tears streami g down l1er face. "I would rather die in the attempt to escape than remain longer here. I have heard of several prisoners who hare succeeded. Can't you do so too?"  "i We have that very thing under consideration now, Lu-John, Bob, and I; but we don't see how it is to be done. We were trying all last night to decide upon some plan of escape; but there are so many difficulties in the way, it seemns almost hopeless to make any attempt. John, did you come to any conclusion, or you, Bob?" "None as to the way. But I have made up my mind to go out. As Miss Lu says, better die trying than live here.," 'Can't you bribe the guards?" said Mary, as she opened her basket, and turning up the tracts, drew forth a well-filled port- monnaie. "Here is enough for three, I should think." "Hazardous experiment, Miss Mary. These creatures are so treacherous. One of the prisoners gave a sentinel a twenty-dollar gold piece to let him pass; the man, after agreeing to do it, fired his gun, and the poor fellow was retaken, placed in chains, and fed on bread and water for days." "Well, can't you climb over the wall, or dig out?" she asked, laughing.  "The latter is the only method that seems to me at all practi4 cable, and I have decided to try it. The only obstacle is the dirt. I can't see what we will do with it. If left where it can be seen, it will create suspicion, and every inch around the inclosure would be thoroughly examined." "Why, the dirt-that's but a small matter, Charley. Put it in your hats and pockets until you get out," suggested Mary, laughingly.  ' Capital idea, Mary;" exclaimed her brother, springing to his feet. "That's just the thing. The way is open before us. We'll be free, Charley, won't we?' "But once out, John, how are we to get through to Kentucky? There we would be safe. But how are we to pass through this abolition State without detection?" "That is a question, Charley, that must be met before we set out. Mary, can you and Miss Lu solve this difficulty for us? Woman's wit is always ready for any emergency."   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         91 "Charley, we have a relation, Cousin Sam Lightfoot, living near the railroad, about fifteen miles from Columbus. He is as good a Southern mnan as you are, and I know he will be glad, to assist you. Ylou can go there, and he will direct you how to get through."  "Ah, Miss Lu, I felt sure you could devise some plan for us. If we can get that far out safely, we'll certainly make good our escape." As the quartette were thus busily engaged in completing these arrangements, Bob suddenly thrust his head in at the door and called out, "Guard." \ In a moment the two gay ones subsided into meek and quiet nuns, and with their books presented, were most earnestly urging on their silent listeners the necessity of giving heed to the things pertaining to the world to come. " ' I think these two young fellows are in a fair way to become religious," said Bob to the guard, who was an Irishman and a Catholic. "See how penitent they look, while those two good sisters are telling them their duty. I have been reading one of their good little books myself," and he displayed the one John had left with him, "and I do believe the Catholic church is the only true church, after all."  "To be sure it is, sir. It is, indade, the only thrue church, an' there ain't none beside it, at all, at all." The bait had taken. The man's face lighted into a regular Irish smile. He looked pleasantly into the door, and without comment passed on. "Here, my friend, you must read this most excellent work," said Bob, calling out to him as he walked off.' "I know you'll be delighted with it." "No, no, thank ye, sir. Kape it yourself. I cannot rade." "And yet you are called loyal, you old fool, you, and are placed here to guard me, when you know no more about constitution and law than the vile numsculls that put you here," muttered Bob between his teeth, as he locked after the ignorant old man, who, "clothed in a little brief authority," strutted on, as a la soldier as it was possible for one of his calibre to do.     t The mementoes of love, provided by the hand of affection at home, were given to the young men. Full arrangements for escape were made, hasty adieus given, and the two young girls, with bonnets drawn closely over their faces, sought the idoor. lv  . I     92        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "We shall expect you at the appointed time. Success to your undertaking," and with meek, bowed mien the two nuns passed out, distributing their tracts as they went. Their ruse had succeeded fully. Not a suspicion had been aroused, and the two girls returned to Columbus. II   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         93 ;       CCHAPTER XV. ;   HOW THE PLAN OF ESCAPE SUCCEEDED. "WE must begin our work to-night, Charley. By Saturday morning we are to be at your cousin's. This is Thursday, and if we are entirely successful, we cannot more than, accomplish our purpose. But we must tell Bob about it, and see if he approves of our plan." The young friend was called in, and the matter laid before him. He indorsed it fully, and coincided in the view of promptly be- ginning the work. 'Btit, boys, we cannot dig out to-night, and what are we to do with the hole to-morrow? We can carry the dirt in our pockets, as Mary suggested; but who will take care of the opening? ' "We can put our dirty clothes over it, John. You know it is our custom to throw them beside the fence to be washed. This, as it is usual, will create no suspicion."  "Yes, I must have a pair of new pants and shoes; and so must you, Charley. How would we look, my boy, in your cousin's par- lor, with this garb on? And, moreover, this will be a good way f to save our money. Bob, there, appears quite like a gentleman, with his new suit from top to toe." "I was fortunate, you see, boys, in getting mine when I did. They still have twenty dollars of my money; but that's a small matter. The rascals are welcome to it, if I can only be allowed to bid them an eternal farewell." The three young men separated-Charley and Bob returned to the playground, while John went to make application for the pants and shoes. Night came. Under cover of its thick darkness the three. pris- oners entered upon their hazardous undertaking. In breathless silence they pursued their work, using only their penknives and three sharp sticks which they had fashioned for the pur- pose. Not a word was spoken, as assiduously they labored on. 1      "       'RAIDS AND ROMANCE The earth, as fast as removed, was carefully piled together, to be placed in their hlats and pockets when the night's work was over. It was a tedious process, but the three prisoners aped tlemselves like men determined to conquer. The enclosure, embracing several acres of ground, was sur- round  by a high, wooden fence, on top of which were placed planks, at regular intervals,i where the guard kept watch, so as to have a view without, as well as within. As with bated breath the three young men worked on, the heavy tramp of the senti- nel overhead keeping his lonely watch was distinctly heard. At first his marked footstep struck terror to the hearts of the mid- niglt workmen; but as hour after hour they toiled on, it became  familiar music, and it was only its cessation that awoke fore- bodings. The night was starless, which greatly favored their purpose, as it shielded them from discovery on every hand. Hour after hour they toiled on, never for a moment pausing in their undertaking. At three o'clock in the morning, as the first faint beams of the rising morn, struggling through the rifted clouds, began to light up the dark landscape, they carefully gathered up the new earth, filled their hats, pockets, shoes, socks, etc., threw the heap of soiled clothing over the opening, and stealthily crept away and secreted themselves until morning. Finding their weight of dirt burdensome, they deposited it under some loose planks in their sleeping-room. Early application was made for the new outfits that had been selected the previous evening. They were furnished during the afternoon. Immediately the old garments were doffed in favor of their successful rivals. The remaining hours of the day were spent in sleep. It is ten o'clock at night. Most o the prisoners have retired to rest-some on the floor of their rude plank house; others, pre- ferring the open air to the noisolme roomns, have thrown them-. selves on the ground, with no covering save a blanket. Tlle sen- tries are on duty. No sound is heard but the dead monotone of their heavy tramp. The stars are out to-night, but their radiance,) soft and mild, throws but a dreamy light over the scene. Noiselessly the prisoners arise from their pallets. Not a word is spoken as they pass on among their sleepy companions. They gain the open air, and pause to look about them that they may be assured of their safety. Charley ventures first, the two follow, each several paces behind the other, so that if one shall be   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.          5 discovered it may not involve his companions. Breathlessly they steal along like shadows in the faint starlight. Charley is within a few paces of the outlet. The sentinel halts in his round and pauses to listen. The prisoner crouches to the ground, and screens himself in the dark shadow of a house. His comrades mark his movement and follow his example. A moment more the sentry, reassured, resumes his round. Charley glides back to where his friends are in their hiding-places, whispers to them the incident and his fears. The three crouch together near the house, and in low tones canvass the prospect be- fore them. It is at length decided to remain in their present position until the guard, weary with watching, shall slumber at his post. Eleven o'clock. They rise and stealthily approach the scene of their last night's labors. The sentinel no longer treads his weary beat; his eyes have become heavy with his night-watching, and he leans upon his gun. Now is their time for action. In one hour, and the guard will be relieved. Before that time their work must be accomplished, if at all. The prisoners gain the spot, throw aside the heap of clothing, and apply themselves to the removal of the earth that intervenes between them and the world without. They work with silent desperation. A half hour more and the task is accomplished. Who shall venture first? The moments flee-there is no time for parley. John shall lead, as he is smallest. With difficulty he makes his way through. But he is at last successful, and stands out- side the prison walls. The two within enlarge the opening with their sharp sticks. A few moments more, and they are beside their comrade. Novel position-they can scarcely realize it. Once more at liberty, beyond the pale of that high frowning wall, which, for two long weary months has shut them in from freedom. They pause a moment to assure themselves thajt they are not discovered. All is unbroken stillness. The sentinel sleeps on. Thank God, they are free! "Come, boys, profound silence, as you value your lives. Follow me," and Charley leads the way through. the buildings without.

"We talk, boys, as if we were surely out of the reach of the lion's paw. For my pert, I cannot see how we are to get from here to Louisville, and from there to our army," said Bob, whose usually hopeful nature seemed to have yielded to a certain degree of timidity, which prevented him from indulging in any bright anticipations. "Oh, if we can but reach the city, Bob, I do not fear beyond that. All southern Kentucky is right, and every man we meet will befriend us. We will have to trust ourselves to the ingenuity of the girls to provide for our safety to Louisville. I am sure they can manage the case for us. Don't you think so, Charley?" "I am confident of it, John. I would not hesitate for a momeit to trust them for release from Fort Lafayette itself. Their visit to us proves then equal to any emergency.

Who would have thought that those two demure-looking nuns, with their baskets of tracts, were our merry, timid sisters, come to plai our escape from prison? If I were a writer I'd im- mortalize these heroines." "Your sisters deserve immortality and fame, boys. I do believe we should now and forever have be n in that miserable place if they had not encouraged us in our undertaking." "You are right, Bob. And yet, what an easy matter it was af- ter all!" '1 And how sad a matter it would have been, Charley, if we had been discovered The fates were propitious, and the Dutchman was sleepy, so we made our way out; and now we shall be bre- veted among our friends for gallant conduct and heroic daring, when really I d? not believe our emotions ever rose a whit above selfishness." The Ithree in ulged in a hearty laugh over their success, and humming a verse or two of Dixie, they pursued their way cheeri- ly on,                       I "Ihave been thinking, boys," said John, breaking the silence "that if we could procure a genteel coat anda hat each, we might take the cars to-morrow for Cincinnati, and go from there to Lou- isville by boat. Wouldn't it be pleasant once more to act the gen- tleman and be in society?" "You are right, John. It would be delightful, indeed, t3 see ourselves acknowledged gentlemen, we have so long been treated as brutes. But getting the clothes is the rub. We are gentlemen now, forsooth, but unfortunately minus the cash; and how to sup* ply this very sad need, I must acknowledge myself wholly inade- quate to suggest. Can you give me any light, boys?" "Oh, leave that to the girls, Bob; they will meet the case. I am sure they have discussed every possible plan, and I'll venture they have already selected the one most likely to succeed." The faint gleams of morning were just beginning to tinge the eastern sky. The pedestrians, weary and worn, were looking out with longing hearts for their destination. "That must be the house, boys, there to the left. Look! don't you see the light in the front windows? That was the signal the girls agreed upon, and surely we have come fifteen miles since we struck the railroad." Charley was right. That was the house, and the two sisters, with Cousin Sam and his wife, were in the parlor awaiting them. Joyous was the meeting between the young girls and the e,- 5     98        RAIDS AND ROMANCE caped prisoners. Very little like nuns did the two glad young  creatures look as they welcomed their brothers and their friend to liberty. A lunch had been prepared by the kind hostess, and never was food more enjoyed than by these three half-starved men. It had been many a month since they had enjoyed the lux-  ury of a private tab e, and they declared that, in honor to their  hostess and their own appetites, they must make amends for past f neglect.                             It was very soon determined-for no time could be lost-that Charley, with the addition of a coat and hat to his toilet, should ! accompany the young ladies to Louisville, while his companions,  under such directions as Mr. Lightfoot could give them, should make their way on foot to Cincinnati; there cross the Ohio river into Boone county, where Bob had friends, who would provide them safe conduct to the city. Accordingly, the morning foundl the two young ladies, with their escort, looking quite la Ue ode,  seated in the cars bound for Cincinnati. The following night they were safely landed at Louisville, Here, to avoid any possibility of exposure, a hack was taken, and at that late hour the party i drove out to Mr. R.'s. Words are powerless to express the joy in the homestead when Charley was welcomed back to its affection and comforts. The mother's heart overflowed with tenderness as she pressed him to her bosom, while great tears of joy streamed down her face; and  the father's soul swelled high With grateful pride as he clasped  his noble boy in his arms, while the sisters and brother heapedj upon him affectionate caresses, and were never weary of lingering  near him to listen to the recital of his varied adventures. And our young hero, amid the happiness which surrounded him, forgot  for the time the trials and sufferings of the past two months. Mary remained with the family to await the arrival of her brother, and her presence was to Charley as that of an angel visitant.  Vows of love, long ago given, were renewed, to be consummated when independence and peace should bless the Southern Confed- eracy. There was but one shadow resting over the sunny scene. It was the sad thought, that hid itself away in the bosom of each. that soon-ah I too soon-must come the bitter parting.   OF M[ORGAN AND HS MEN.        99 CHAPTER   XVIL.  THE PEDESTRIANS. BENEATH the old oak-tree, whose bursting buds were unfolding tender leaves of green, satMary and Charley. It was the last evening of his stay at home. To-morrow, ere the sun should be- 'gin its daily circuit, he must bid farewell to loved ones, and go to seek a life of exile and danger. The evening sun, declining low in the west, threw its golden glo- ry in long lines of living light back upon the earth, now springing into life and beauty. Fleecy clouds of white floated lazily through the azure heavens, catchi ng upon theirswestern margins the radi- ant hues of the departing sun; and as the eye looked up into the 'Vault above, the soul could fancy itself gazing up-up through the Alue empyrean--beyond sun and moon and remotest star--into the glorious splendor of the New Jerusalem, whose sapphirine beauties beamed from out their far-off heavenly home down upon the emerald earth. The evening wind swept gently by, kissing the grass-blades and the tender leaflets, and bearing the sweet breath of the lovely violet that nestled in its modest loneliness beside the field fe ce-row and at the foot of the giant forest-tree. Before them lay the city, its distant spires gleaming in the gor- geous rays of th6 setting sun, its busy hum falling on the listening ear like the dull monotone of a' mournful dirge. Beyond it rose the dark blue outline of the hills which skirt the northern bank of the beautiful Ohio. It was a charming scene. One that might invite the pencil of Claude Lorraine. The lovers had long been seated at the foot of the old familiar tree, talking over their pres- ent, past, and future, and sealing in words of love's own eloquent truth the vows long ago pledged. To their young 'and bursting hearts the coming years gave promise of joy and gladness. Yet over that radiant pathway there could be discovered, even by their inexperienced vision, the shadow--aye, the gloom.  Why is it thus, that even in our most joyous moments the heart is ever aware of these gathering clouds, which, though all     100      . RAIDS A"D ROM!ANCE unseen, throw their darkling shade over our life-path? Is it that the malediction pronounced upon our first parents, as they turned their weeping eyes for the last time upon their lost Eden, and bent their burdened step out into the unknown waste before them, has found lodgment in our fallen nature-is so burnt in upon the strug- gling soul of man, that he needs not bitter experience to teach him that the evil ever accompanies the good? As the dancing wind lifted the dark auburn ringlets from the passive Grow of Mary, and kissed with its cooling breath her cheek flushing with love's own holy kindlings, Charley gazed upon her with silent admiration. Tears started to his eyes, and his oppressed heart sighed heavily. Mary turned her eyes with a look of sorrow upward to his. "Why do you sigh, -harley?" she asked in tones of tender- ness. "It is sad to part, but you know there is no safety here for you. They would take you from us, and put you in prison. We must bear this trial as heroically as we can. It is a deep, deep one, but there is no other hope." "I feel reproved, Mary," he replied, "by your words of truth and courage. It is not the parting-and God knows this is bitter enough-neither is it dread of the battle-field that thus oppresses me; but--" and he paused, as, if unwilling to proceed; but- Mary, pardon me, I would not do you injustice-you are young, you will be courted, flattered, tempted. I do not doubt your truth--heaven knows I do not-and yet-and yet--I cannot tell why, when I think on this, my brain burns, my heart throbs with the wildest torment. Young Morton-Mary, do not, I beseech you, trust him. He is made to win-and to deceive." "Oh, Charley, Charley! how can you do me this great wrong? Why do you doubt me? Have you not proved my love, and found it constant, undying? Am I younger now than when we last parted' Didl I prove faithless why should I now?"And the young girl burst into a flood of tears. "Oh, forgive me, Mary," said Charley, tenderly, gently draw- ing her towards him, and kissing her burning cheek. "I do not doubt you, and yet-and yet my heart thrills with a strange emotion, when I think of the future. The form of Morton haunts ue." "You need not torture yourself with apprehensions of him,' said Mary, looking confidingly up into her lover's face. '"Our love was merely the fancy of our childish hearts, a wild, foolish admiration for each other, because we called each other sweet- I  k -  .   OF MORGAN AMD HS MEN.        101 hearts.

She wishes Charley to supervise some little preparation she is making for hir." Charley, resigning Mary to his sister, who conducted her to the parlor, passed to his mother'S room to furnish any necessary sug- gestions. An hour later, and the family, grouped in the parlor, were dis- cussing the probability of the recapture of the two young sol- diers, when a loud and hasty knock at the door interrupted the conversation for a moment. The servant announced two gentle- men. They were shown into the parlor. Mr. R. rose, bowed politely, and asked them forward to the fire. The visitors return- ed the salutation without speaking, and advanced. It is brother!" exclaimed Mary, springing from her seat on the sofa, and throwing her arms around the young man's neck. g    L "Why, John and Bob, can it be you?" said Charley, seizing a hand of each. '"We were just speaking of you. Didn't know but that the Yankees had you again; we were fearful we should never see you." The two heroes were heartily welcomed by all, and many were the congratulations offered on their safe arrival. Well, John, if you and Mr. Reed had suffered yourselves to be again taken by the Yankees, we should have left you to your fate. Wouldn't we, Lu Couldn't turn nun again, and run all the risk of being discovered a second time to effect an escape for you." And Mary laughed one of her sweet, merry laughs, while she looked archly first at her brother, and then at her friend, whose cheeks were suffused with crimson blushes. Indeed, Miss Mary, I'do not think we should be deserted by the ladies in our misfortunes," replied young Reed. "You know it would be no fault of ours, if we were even now within the gloomy walls of Camp Chase, instead of being hlre in this most delectable society: and I feel assured that you would again, in the generousness of your heart, rush to our rescue. Don't you think so, Charley?" and Reed looked quizzically at the young lover, whose eyes were riveted on the bright, smiling face of Mary.     102        RAIs, AND ROMANCE It was now Oharley's time to blush, which he did deeply, not- withstanding his efforts to subdue his rising emotion. "Indeed, indeed, Mr. Reed, you are mistaken!" exclaimed Mary, animatedly, at the same time manifesting the embarrass- ment which seemed to be becoming general among the young members of the circle. "I advise you, gentlemen, to avoid, at all  hazards, another introduction to a Federal prison, lest, unhappily, no angels of mercy should come to your rescue." "A word to the wise man is sufficient, Mr. Reed," interposed Lu, pleasantly, who had been silently listening to the badinage. "I am sure you will never again thus test our courage and kind- ness." "But tell us, young, gentlemen," said Mr. R., who was impa- tient to hear the young men's story, " how you succeeded in get- ting through to Kentucky. We have been in a most anxious state cf mind, with regard to your welfare. I suppose you have had some adventures by the way-perhaps some narrow escapes from the Yankees." "We feared that they had caught you," said Mrs. IR., her kind, motherly face speaking more than her words the interest of. her heart. "And Charley had decided to leave to-morrow,.lest he should share the same fate." "How do you go, Charley?" asked young Lawrence. "I sup-  pose you have some plan marked out 'for getting through?" "None, John; I must trust to ny wits. Several friends have suggested to me methods, but all of them are 'alike full of risk. I think I know enough of the country through which I am to pass, and enough of Yankee character, to make good my way to Colonel Morgan."                    i "Ah, you intend to join Morgan, do you? Jchn, that will be the idea for us. I am heartily tired of infantry lifer And, more- over; we need the exercise and dash of cavalry-men to restore us to our former vigor.

"But how do you propose to get through, gentlemen?" asked Charley. "Now that you are so experienced in eluding the vigi- lance of the foe, doubtless, you can aid me on my way." "We go through like gentlemen, Charley," responded young Reed, laughing. "Do you not think we are entitled to this privi- lege, in virtue of these handsome new suits?" he added, at the   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        103 same time rising from his chair, and displaying his finished suit of black clothes. "Undoubtedly, you deserve all the privileges due to gentle- men, responded Charley, looking somewhat bewildered at young Reed's manner and remark, " but I fear me you will find your new suit of black but a poor safeguard against Yankee watchfulness and hate." "Oh, my friend, we by no means depend on our attire for pass- port through the lines; only look to it to secure us the civilities by the way due to Kentucky gentlemen. We take the boat to-mor' row or next day, provided these officials do not have us in the military prison before then, and shall depend on our permits to secure us safe transit to Dixie."  "Permits, Bob; what do you mean?" and Charley's look of wonder and perplexity increased. "Oh, we go out as cotton agents, duly authorized. Here, ex- amine our papers, and see if it is not so," and Reed took from his pocket and handed to Charley some papers, which the latter took and examined carefully; then, with an expression of mingled surprise and doubt, gazed up into the face of his facetious friend, who, with young Lawrence, was highly enjoying Charley's entan- glement. This last remark of Reed's had aroused the inquisitive- ness of every one present, and a look of curious inquiry rested on each face. Charley opened the permits, and read them a second time. "Boys, are these genuine?" he asked, after duly scrutinizing them again and again. "Or do you design to attempt. to out- Herod Herod?" "Genuine! of course," replied Reed, with an assumed air of insulted dignity, at this insinuation against his honor, and that of his friend. "Do you not see they are duly signed?" "But, if genuine, how did you obtain them? Certainly, you must have in some way imposed on somebody." "  Why, Charley, my friend, haive not James Safford, Esq., and John Livingston, ditto, true and loyal men,lwho have endured long and' dreary exile from home and friends beloved, because of their ardent devotion to this glorious ' nion,' 'the dear old a' and ' the best government in the world,' have not these patriots, so distinguished for their sufferings, a right to the protection of that government, and a, small share of its profits?"

Charley shared the merriment, but with less zest than the others.   I "Well, boys," said he, you puzzle me more and more.  "Do tell us the meaning of these official documents, and explain  to us how they were procured." 'Oh, dotell us the whole story," cried out several voices. "We would hear all your adventures through Ohio and Kentucky to  Louisville." "Our hegira from Camp Chase was attended by no incidents worth the mention until we came to Cincinnati. We traveled on like two common workmen, avoiding every thing that looked sus-- picious, stopping at night wherever darkness overtook us, behaving very much like poor men all unused to society--that is, playingg mum on all subjects until we ascertained the sentiments of our host; if adverse to ours, we declared lustily in favor of the glorious Union, tiraded against the rebels, and after that played mum for the remainder of the night.  "If, however, we discovered that we were in congenial society, and this was our good fortune two nights out of four we gave full rein to our powers of entertainment, related all our adventures, answered the many hundred questions propounded to us by our eager listeners, and in our turn gained all the intelligence we could about the Yankees and their movements.  "Tuesday night, weary and worn with our tramp, we halted with an old avaricious Jew, just outside Cincinnati. We told him we were from Tennessee. He immediately asked if we knew any thing about the cotton section. John caught his idea in a mo- mert, and, determining to mak:e capital out of it, readily answered that we were well acquainted with all the cotton region of that StSte; that our fathers were heavy planters, and now had on haAd a very large amount of that'very desirable article. The bait bad taken. The old man's eye flashed with delight under this in- telligence, and he hinted his desire to buy cotton, intimating his fear to be found in Tennessee, lest he should be overtaken by the rebels. We cautiously proposed to act as his agents should he desire it. 1"His keen black eye twinkled with the joy that filled his bosom, ard he unhesitatingly accepted our offer. He agreed to pay us a commission on delivery of the cotton at Cincinnati. We ac- ceded to this, and the contract was immediately drawn and duly si'ned. "The next morning he took us to headquarters in the city, pro- i   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN. ,       105 cured for us permits, and seeing we were in rather a sorry plight, opened his narrow Jewish heart sufficiently to give us a new hat and coat each, paid our passage to Louisville, and sent us out on  our most lucrative agency. And here we are to prosecute our un- dertaking like gentlemen of the strictest integrity and highest business ability." "Bravo!" exclaimed one and all, as Bob finished his story, you deserve a medal for your triumph." "Or to be brevetted," added Charley. ;' So you see our stay among the Hoosiers has rather sharpened our wits, and Bob and I feel that no emergency can arise in the future that will seriously trouble us." "And you leave to-morrow, do you, boys?" asked Mr. R. "I wish Charley would go with you. I do not at all like the thought  of his setting out alone to travel so far through the enemy's territory." "Yes, sir," responded young Lawrence; "we shall take the first Cincinnati boat. This will obviate the necessity of renewing our permits. Charley," said he, turning and addressing his young friend, "cannot we devise some plan that will insure your safety with us?" "I fear not, John. We should have to practice so much de- ception, and I should be so much more public than in a land trip, I think I prefer the risks of the latter. I shall leave very early to-morrow morning, and hope soon to join you and Bob in Dixie land, where, under the victorious banner of Colonel Morgan, we shall avenge our wrongs and the wrongs of the noble fellows who yet pine amid the Qelty of Camp Chase." Supper was anno  ed, after which the family reassembled in the parlor, where m ic and cheerful conversation made pleasant the fast fleeting hours. Southern songs were sung by the young people, in which Mr. and Mrs. R. joined with that zest which told, in word and look, their devotion to the cause to which they had yielded up their son. The hours tripped by with rosy feet. Yet there were moments when the heart, leaving behind the delights of the present, looked out with trembling on the sad parting of the mI orrow. The hour came for the young men to leave, as it was necessary for them to be in the city, that they might avail themselves of the first Cincinnati packet. With renewed pledges of friendship and mutual wishes for safety and success, the three young men bade each other adieu.   .  5*     TH morning came.

Ah, has not every A homestead throughout the land witnessed the same sad scene?  ' And the heart has but to recall its own bitter experience to realize the gloom of that darkened household, as the angel of grief folded its wing over each stricken bosom.  i We would not invade the sacred sorrow of the young loving heart of her who was now called upon to yield up to the dread chances of war that heart's idol. It were sacrilegious to invade the hallowed temple where, mid the purity of such deathlees affec- tion and the clinging memories of the years gone by, the beloved image sat enshrined.  Ah, how very poor is all language to express the keen emotions of joy and sorrow that (the human heart is capable of experi- encing! No analysis can do justice to the varied shades of feeling that move its inmost springs, and full often, even in a moment of time, give rise to thoughts and emotions that influence the life i throughout all coming time.     I Circumstances light as straws are levrs in the building up of character. Fired with a loftier devotion to the cause he had embraced, since by sore experience he had become acquainted with the in- famy and injustice of those who opposed it, inured to deprivations and sufferings, with a score of deep personal wrongs to avenge, our young hero left home a second time to engage in the great struggle a wiser and a more determined man. ,By the exercise of his ingenuity and daring, both of which had geatly developed under the stern teachings of the last eight months, he succeeded in reaching Gallatin, Tennessee. From here it was his intention to proceed-to the vicinity of Nashville, hoping that, as Colonel Morgan was frequently dashing around in the neighborhood of that city, he should be able to join his command without delay. t        11' %I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        107 Leaving Gallatin, he crossed the Cumberland, and was proceed- ing towards Nashville, when one morning about 6 o'clock he was accosted by a squad of Lincolnites, who imperatively bade him halt. His astonishment was so great at this unexpected meeting with the enemy, that for the moment he lost his self-possession, and before he could recover his equipoise, he found himself sur- rounded by six burly Indianians, who, seizing his bridal-rein and presenting their pistols to his breast, claimed him as their prisoner.  Recovering himself, he manifested great surprise and indigrga- tion, protesting against1 their act, alleging that they had no right to arrest him, an unarmed citizen, who was passing through the * country on business of his own. They questioned him closely, evidently not at all satisfied with his storyv and his answers, ambiguous and indefinite as they ne- cessarily ere, fixed their suspicions. He was arrested, sent under guard to Nashville, where, refusing to take the oath, he was com- miitted to prison as a spy. And thus in a few brief hours were all his bright!expectatioqs, all his joyous hopes, dashed as by the hand of some pitiless divinity, and he whose soul had panted for the contest and the fray, whose thoughts had dwelt but upon glory and revenge, found himself a helpless, hopeless prisoner in the power of his detested foe. Ah, how bitter were his reflections as he lay in his narrow cell, isolated from the world without, friendless, devoid of hope! De- spair came to be a guest with him, overshadowing, with its leaden wing, both present and future, and the two sat down together over the grave of buried joy and blighted hope, to mourn unavail- ingly. After a fev days passed in this deep despondency, our young heroi rallied, ind, with that desperation that impels to the most daring exertions, he roused himself, resolving to escape or perish in the attempt. He soon managed through another prisoner, a young Tennes- seean, who enjoyed more privileges than did Charley, to make known his condition to sonme Southern gentleman of the city, who undertook to effect his release. His case underwent investigation; nothing could be substantiated against him, and he was offered liberty on condition that he would take the oath. This he per- emptorily refused to do, urging that they had no right'thus to question his loyalty, and, unless they could satisfctorily establish that he had compromised it, it was an insult to is honor to re- quire him to take any oath..     108        RAIDS AND ROMANCE This course of reasoning being by no means convincing to the obtuse minds of his judges, he was remanded to prison. Loathsome, beyond the power of words -to portray, was the cell allotted to him. Filled with vermin of all kinds, with a negro on one side and a criminal on the other; shut out froli the light 9f day, damp and noisome, it would have been cruelty to have inr- mured a felon of the most atrocious character within its dreadful walls. Added to this, the meagre exercise he was permitted to take was insufficient to preserve his health, and his food, of the coarsest and most unwholesome nature, was furnished in such scant quantities, as scarcely to support fife. All he had undergone at Camp Chase was as nothing compared to his present tortures.  He soon became convinced that without a change he must die- yet he would not t ke the oath.  Charley had been in prison about a week, when one morning  early he was suddenly aroused by a noise in front of his cell.  Starting to his fee ,the peered through the iron bars of his grate,  to endeavor to ascertain the cause. By the flickering light of the lamp, he saw a young nan forced along by two of the guard, who held him on either side. He was tall, handsome, and wore the defiant look of one who had made up his mind never to yield. The prisoner was dressed in citizen's garb, but his sun-browned brow and military air bespoke him a soldier.  With a brutal oath he was rudely thrust by the coarse, unfeel- ing men into the second cell from Charley. "Who can this be?" soliloquized Charley, as he threw himself back upon his iron bed, and passed his hand over his forehead, as if to collect his scattered thoughts. "He cannot be a convict? No, no. That fine face, and manly form, and air of hauteur, can belong to none other than a gentleman. How defiantly he scowl- ed on the guard that bore him along. There is spirit not to be subdued in that breast. The true, genuine soul that defies time  and circumstance, and acknowledges no conqueror but death. 1 almost fancy I have seen that face before, and that proud form looks strangely familiar. He must be a Kentuckian-one of Mor- gan's men. Looks something like Colonel Morgan himself-so brave, so noble, so daring. Can it be he? Oh, no; he would die first. I do wish I knew who it is. 'll make his acquaintance the first opportunity. Wonder if he would take that oath-that vile, detestable oath! I'm sure he will not. No one with that look would ever submit to such degradation!

We may both die in this horrid place." Charley made his plain toilet with a degree of animation he had never before felt since he entered that dark and noisome abode. While he was thus engaged, a strain of music arrested his atten- tion. He pressed his ear close to the iron bars to catch the words- "Awake and to horse, ry brothers- Look up to the rising sun, And ask of thd God that shines there, If deeds like these shall be done?" He listened. The thrilling words were repeat The voice was clear and musical, and, although somewhat subdued, the ex- pression bespoke the strong, deep feeling of the heart that gave utterance to the stirring words. "Hush your singing there, fellow, and behave yourself," said the guard, in a coarse, gruff tone, as he passed by. The music ceased. Charley fancied he heard a suppressed oath. But he was mistaken. The dark vow of vengeance was uttered only by the bursting heart. It needed not words to give it strength of pur- pose or remembrance. "I go from here at all hazards. I go to be avenged. This insult shall be atoned for by blood."  Thus vowed the prisoner, as, with fury-lit eyes and elevated hands, he stood beside his barred door, and looked upon the wretch who had insulted him. And fearfully has that vow been kept. Beside the low Muskingum, where the evening winds Wail through the forest-trees a sad requiem for the slain, in the desolate cottage sits the lone widow, with her three little children, mourning over the lost husband. She knows not where he lies. But, this she has heard, "He was killed by one of Morgan's men."     "O      i  AIDS AND ROOMANCE CHAPTER XIX. THE PRISON CHAT. AT breakfast the two prisoners met. Glances were exchanged. It was enough. They understood each other, and as they filed out, Charley touched the young man on the shoulder, and whis- pered "Southern?" A slight nod of the head, and a smile was tihe only reply. 'Meet me in the courtyard," Charley said, in an undertone; "I want to talk with you." It was several days before the proposed interview took place, for at first the young man was not permitted to leave his cell, ex- cept to come to his meals. In the mlea t time Charley had learned, from snatches of conversation in going to and from the table, that the prisoner was one of Morgan' men, caught within the Federal lines. But as he was in civilian's garb when arrested, and not known to any one in Nashville, it was not likely his punishment would be any thing more than imprisonment. At length, after a weeks close confinement, the young man was permitted to walk in the open court with the other political pris- oners. The first opportunity that offered for conversation was eagerly seized upon by the two Kentuckians, to inquire into the past his- tory of each other, and lay plans for future action. "a I came out from Kentucky last September with Colonel Mor- gan, and have been with him since until a few weeks ago," replied the young man to Charley's interrogatory. t( Then we have met before. I, too, was in ' Camp Secret,' and came through with that fearful expedition to Green River. There I joined Colonel Hanson's regiment-" "And were taken prisoner at DonelsonV" interrupted the lis- tener, eagerly. "Yes, and sent with others to Camp Chase." '0 And escaped from prison? How did you succeed in doing it, ' i     i  '   , '  * i    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN. and how came you here?" asked the young man, hurriedly, his face brightening with the interest he felt ifi the fate of his new --acquaintance. Charley briefly and graphically recounted his story. His com- panion listened with breathless attention' "Quite an adventure, indeed.' You are already a hero. How unfortunate that after all your trials, and your successful escape, you should again be taken and lodged in this disgusting place. Better by far be in Camp Chase than in this, miserable place. Surely no other prison-house in all the range of Yankeedom can be as horrid as this!" "That is wretched enough, I assure you, but this is far worse. But I find the same brutality and coarseness characterize their officers and guard everywhere; in this respect I discover no dif- ference." "Can this be so? I had supposed that on their own soil, re- moved from any apprehension of danger, and free from the pro- voking influences of daily contact with Southern people, they would manifest some degree of humanity. I know they are every- where cold, heartless, and overbearing; but I thought they must be more brutal here than there."     ! "No better there than here. Vulgarity, coarseness, I might say fiendishness, are each day experienced by the prisoners at Camp Chase, and there remains to them no redress. I will give you an illustration of their savage cruelty in one of the most heartless incidents that ever blackened the record of any people, however savage. It took place while I was a prisoner there. "A poor man was arrested in Western Virginia for alleged dis- loyalty. As usual, no charge was brought against' him, save this general one. He  was told that he must go to prison with the guard. ' To what prison ' -he asked. ' No matter to what prison ' they answered with an oath. 'You must go with us, and that right away.  We  have no 'ime to wait.' It was night. The wretched man knew not what to do, for in the low bed beside him slept his three motherless children. He felt he must obey the inhuman order, but how could he leave his little ones without protection, without any one to care for them? The eldest was nine, the youngest only three years old. An old negro woman, who attended to the children, was the only being about the house, and she was no safeguard against the brutal soldiery that infested the neighborhood. In his great extremity, not kno)'wing what else to do, the wretched father besought his captors to allow his chil- -  'I     "2        RAIDS AND ROMNCE  dren to go with him to prison. The request, strange to say, was granted. The four were brought to Camp Chase. The poor man was placed in strict confinement; his children were imprisoned in another part of the ground. They were never permitted to see each other. With the most heart-rending entreaties the stricken father implored to see his children-only once. The children wept and prayed to see the father. Day after day, week after week,; were entreaties, groans, and cries!poured into the deaf ear of the hellish guard. But all was useless. Their hearts were harder than the adamant-the permission was never granted. "6 The health of the heart-broken man gave way under his heavy grief and close confinement. He languished on amid his dark sor- rows, and then died. In his last moments he prayed, entreated, besought them just to let him see his children once, that he might bless them before he closed his eyes in death., He was told his children were doing very well, but he could not see them. "And thus, calling for 'his children,' his 'poor little children,' his 'motherless children,' the agonized spirit of that poor out- raged father went up with its tale of deep, damning wrong before the tribunal of the Lord Jehovah." The young man grew pale as he listened. "My God!" exclaim- ed he, springing to his feet and clenching his hands, as if in a paroxysm, "1 was there ever, ever such brutality, such dark, hell- ish cruelty. God in heaven will avenge that injured man. I swear by all that's holy, that if ever again I meet these fiends on the battle-field, the thoughts of that poor man's wrongs shall move my heart to do, and dare, and die, that he and his helpless children may be avenged." "And I have seen the guard shoot a man dead merely because in play he had accidentally stepped beyond the limits assigned him. And again, another was shot by a vile Dtatchman becauSe he carelessly threw his arm across the wretch's path." "And what, sir, leave we to hope from such a people?" exclaim- ed the young man, clenching his teeth, while his face assumed a look of desperate revenge. '"Call themu brothers, friends? They are devils incarnate-fiends from the lowest pit. Neyer, never could I recognize them in any other light than foes, enemies that must be defeated, swept from the face of the earth. Oh, that every Southern man could hear that tale of cruelty, that it might nerve his arm in the day of conflict! Blood for blood, life for life! They drive us to it, sir, and I take the issue." The young man's face was flushed with the wildest excitement.   i   '         OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        I3 dHis whole frame trembled-he started forward as if to meet the dastard foe. For several minutes not a word was spoken. Thireso6les of that fearful moment were never forgotten.  The bell rang that summoned the prisoners to their wretche4 supper.                    . In a few days the two met again. The conversation turnet upon the feasibility of escape, and joining Colonel Morgan. I have heard of many wonderful feats performed by Colonel Morgan in the vicinity of this place," said Charley to his new ; formed acquaintance, as the two seated themselves on some loose stones, beneath the shadow of the frowning wall. I suppose his daring is remarkable?" "There is not, sir, a braver or more resolute man living. I have been with hin in most of his adventures, and such courage, combined with foresight and caution, I have never in my life witnessed. On one occasion, very soon after the Yankees took possession of this place, few, about thirty in number, dressed in Federal uniform, under the direction of Colonel Morgan, swept round the city, and, obtaining a good position on the other side of the river, halted for a few minutes to plan an attack Our object was to set fire to two boats which were above the fleet in the river, and send them enveloped in flames to communicate the fire to the others. As I remarked, we halted some little distance out from the city. Colonel Morgan then dispatched five of us into town to fire the boats. Uniformed like the Yankees, we passed along the streets unnoticed."         '  "Did you do this during the day'   asked Charley, in sur- prise.             /        Oh, yes, it was early in the evening. Followin Colonel -Mor- gan s instructions, we crossed the river to this side; the boats being at the main landing, walked leisurely through ite streets, en- countering everywhere Yankee soldiers and civilians, gained the point nearest the lower boat, which stood out :little way in the river. It was an old affair, and was left in the possqssion of negroes and three Irish soldiers. Securing a yawl that Wa$ near, we put out for the boat. On reaching it, young Winfiqd, from Lexing- ton, took command of the arrangements. We boarded the boat, and ordered off to shore the three Irish soldiers and a portion of the negroes, with instructions that they should be landed and the yawl brought back to thy boat. Winfield ordered every man remaining on board to get into the yawl. He then proceeded I     "4:       RAIDS AND ROMANCE , alone to fire the boat at four different points. This done, he left the vessel, from which the flames were already bursting, and jumping into the yawl, commanded the boatmen, at the peril of their lives, to row to the opposite side. Before we reached the bank the boat, which was now slowly floating down the river, was discovered by the Yankees to be on fire. Great was the conster- nation in their ranks when this became known, as the fleet below contained many sick soldiers. We reached the bank, waved our hats at the affrighted Yankees congregated on the opposite side, bade them adieu, and, finding our horses, returned safely to the command." "And did your plan succeed? It certainly was full of dar- ing."          \         "We have learned from the Yankee papers that the boat was arrested in its downward course in time to save the other boats. What damage they suffered we did not learn. A few days after this, as Colonel Morgan was riding in advance of the body of his men, accompanied by only two others, he met a Yankee colonel and his staff trotting along very leisurely. 'Halt,' said Mor- gan. "'I'll be d-d if I do,' was the reply; 'I have already been halted a half dozen times since I left Nashville, and I'll submit to it no longer. Who are you, any how?' "Morgan quickly drew out his pistol and presented it. 'Mor- gan,' he very quietly replied to the Yankee's interrogatory. 'And you are my prisoner. The Yankee made no further resistance. He and his escort, beside a considerable force which followed in the rear, were made prisoners by Morgan and his men. We were pursued by a heavy Federal force, and young Winfield, who was guiding the rear de- tachment, after having two horses shot under him, was taken p risoner. The remainder escaped."  "And where is he now?" asked Charley "In Camp Douglas. He was for a long, time confined here, but they fearing he would be rescued finally sent him north. "On another occasion, about forty of us in number, headed by Morgan, dashed in upon their pickets one morning early, and cap- tured eighteen out of thirty. At another time a few days after- wards, learning by some means that General McCook and staff would pass out on the Murfreesboro road, Colonel Morgan placed  some fifty of us in ambush, at a point just beyond the toll-gate, to capture the Yankee general and his whole staff. The old gate- I^ ij    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.    1    115 keeper, who had observed our movements, informed McCook that there were about one hundred armed men in the woods ahead of them. Mcpook soon became convinced of the danger, and put- ting spurs to their horses, the whole party proceeded, at Gilpin speedy never for a moment halting,. until they reached the city. The gate-keeper paid the penalty-of his treachery. The boys seized upon him and hung him before Colonel Morgan could inter- fere in his behalf. Not long after this, General Buell was accosted as he went out'from dinner on the landing of the hotel by a wagoner, who it- formed him that the next day a squad of rebels was coming into his (the wagoner's) neighborhood to procure provisions, and that if the general would send out some cavalry the whole force might be captured. Buell asked the wagoner his, name. He gaveit, and told the Yankee general'that he would keep him posted with regard to the movements of the secesh. Buell, suspecting there might be some trick in the matter, inquired into it. To his sur- prise, he' was convinced it was a verity, as there was just such a man living in the designated neighborhood who was a wagoner, well known to the community for his honesty and probity. "The wagoner, who in tpality was no other than Colonel Mor- gan, duly disguised, soon disappeared from the hotel. After he had looked round the streets to his satisfaction, and iheard all the news, he left one bf, our men behind to spy their movements and apprise him of the starting of the expedition, and regained the camp in safety. "The next evening the Lincolnites set out, highly elated with the glory and success that their enterprise promised. Just before they left Nashville, the man who had been keeping a strict watch over their movements, mounted his horse, and following the nearest route to our encampment, gave Colonel Morgan the. information.  "Immediately the colonel prepared for the capture of the whole force. The men were so arranged and instructed that the escape of the Yankees was impossible. On they came, dashing like mailed horsemen of the olden time, their clanking isabres and tramping horses making the earth to resound with mighty rever- berations. When they were sufficiently ensnared, the ignal was given, and we rushed upon their front and rear. Our success was complete. Out of eighty that came to our overthrow, there escaped but four or five to tell the tale of their surprise and defeat."    I  '                      .       I     "6        RIDS AmD ROMANCE "I cannot remain here in captivity, while my comrades are cov- ering themselves with glory 1" exclaimed Charley, his enthusiasm roused to the highest degree under the young man's thrilling re- cital. "I must go from here-go where I can raise my arm in my country's cause. But, alas! how can I get out from this loathsome place?" he added, sighing deeply. "There is but one way, my friend."  "And what is that?" asked Charley, his face growing instantly animated at the bare mention of escape.  Take the oath. There is no other Way to escape." "Take the oath!" he exclaimed, starting from his seat. "Take that infamous oath? Never-neverl Death, a thousand deaths, first!" "It is humiliating in one view of the case; but in this instance, I have decided 'to stoop to conquer,' and I shall take the oath to- morrow. Were there any other alternative, I would not resort to this means of escape. But there remains to me nothing but this or death. I choose the former.' The guard approached where the two were sitting. It was the same who had so abruptly hushed the prisoner's song. The young man recognized him. His brow became dark and knitted, and his lips firmly compressed. He gazed a moment upon his foe and passed to another part of the inclosure. Have you decided the question of taking the oath?" asked the young man, as he encountered Charley*in the long, dark passage that led to the cell.  "Oh, no, no-I cannot. I was offered my liberty when I came here, if I would but swear to its detestable requirements. I re- fused. I would rather perish than do it."  "I appreciate your sentiments. They have been mine; but my views have changed. Of what avail will it be to me or my country, if I lie' here and rot, merely to gratify the cruel hate of these wretches? I'll take their oath, and then go forth to slay them; and in so doing I shall not feel that I have sinned against God, or sacrificed my honor. It is this or death here. They force me to it. I take what appears to me the less of two evils. They have proved nothing against me. They will not bring me to trial, that I may have justice, and they shall not keep me here to die." "You speak truly," replied Charley; " we shall have no show of justice. I know that I must take the vile oath or die here, amid wretchedness and filth. I cannot escape-they will never bring   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        1I1 me to trial. And yet, in view of all this," he added, after a few moment's pause, "I cannot see how I can take that oath." "I do not advise you to act against your convictions of honor. You must' decide for yourself. I have fully made up my mind, and shall take the oath to-morrow. I think it is the wisest thing you can do. But you must rely on your own judgment." The two separated, each to his noisome cell. c     "8        RAIDS AND- ROMANCE CHAPTER XX. THE REFLECTION ANi ITS RESULTS, CHARLEY lay in his dark and narrow cell that night, his mind perplexed with the question before him. Hour after hour passed on, the silence all unbroken, save by the dull tramp of the sentry, and yet the decision was not reached. His noble nature revolted at the idea of the humiliating act. How could he sacrifice his honor by pledging himself to do that which his soul detested? How could he again meet his parents and friends with that burn- ing curse in his heart? "Had I better die a wretched death than cover myself with this deep infamy?" he said to himself, as he turned uneasily on his iron bed. I do not regard it as a sin. God will not hold me responsible for saving my life by any means frot1 the hands of these heartless tyrants. Oh, no, a just Maker will dot condemn. Life or death, which shall I have? Shall I languish here for months, and then go down to the grave, while my country needs my services, or shall I accept the only method of escape that is offered me, and go forth to vindicate justice and truth against hellish wrong and fanatical error? Here I can do nothing,-in the battle-field I might avenge some wrong that my people have sufferad, strike some blow that will aid in their redemption. Others have taken this oath-men of high and noble sentiments-rather than die, as I must do, in a horrid prison. If I could but escape; but this I cannot do, it is utterly impossible-impossible." Thus, until the night watches were far spent, did he debate the knotty question. Sleep overtook him, and found him yet unde- termined. He awoke from his fitful slumbers, which had been haunted by horrid dreams. He felt all the wretchedness of the low, damp cell, filled with every variety of disgusting vermin. His brain reeled with exhaustion, his whole frame trembled with feebleness, which every day must increase. He looked hastily back upon all he had endured, then forward to all he must yet suffer, and, clasping his hands to his burning forehead, he ex-   OF MORGAN AND.

It had been a f&arful struggle, but it was over, and forever. "I go," he said to the young man,-as they met at the door of the dining-room. "Ask me no questions, but make known my request with yours, ard we will go out together."

C AND now for Morgan!" said George Irving, as the two gained the street. But how shall we get there? You who know this country, Irving, must devise the plan." "The first thing to be done is to visit a barber; the next, to obtain a disguise." "But how is this latter to be procured, Irving? Every cent I had was taken from me when they put me in prison, and I have not a friend to whom I would dare to apply." "You mentioned to me a gentlemanu who interested himself for you when you were first committed. Do you know where he resides? I would not for a moment hesitate to make known our circumstances to any true Southern man. I am sure such a one could not be 4ddressed in vain." "Indeed, I cannot find him. I have no idea where he is. I saw him but for a few minutes, and did not so much as learn hi! name." "Well, we must trust to our wits. I do not fear. Let's seek the barber, and trust, like Micawher, for 'something to turn up for our relief. Perhaps it will' be better if we separate. I wil go ahead of you a few paces, keeping always in sight; and as I llave been here several times before, and have a pretty good acquaintance with the streets, I think we will avoid suspicion." The two proceeded, as agreed on, to the barber's, from whence, relieved of their hirsute appearance, tley emerged so metamor- phosed as to defy recognition. They were walking leisurely along the street, scarcely knowing whither to direct their steps, when Charley, grasping the arm of his friend, ejaculated-  I   'i "There he i! I am sure I am not deceived. "Who, y our friend?" "Yes; let's follow him." The two turned, and walked after the gentleman, until tney l                  I      i   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        121 reached his business house. It was the dinner-hour, and no ope was in. They entered, and approached his office, where the mer- chant was sitting with one of his clerks. ' The young man rose to bid them enter. As he encountered Irving, he started, and gazed earnestly upon the visitor. "Irving!" he exclaimed, "is that you?" The soldier, surprised to find himself recognized, fixed a look of searching inquiry on the stranger. A moment's scrutiny suf- ficed. "Why, Ar/thur, how you have changed since last we met! I did not expe t to find you here." Introductions followed, to which ensued a long conversation, wherein the individual story of the friends was rehearsed. Every assistance that Charley and Irving needed was afforded, and a few hours found them with tleir preparations for leaving the city entirely perfected. Wholly changed in personelle, and provided with some whiskey to treat any pickets they might encounter, and a few trifling ar- ticles of trade, the two set out late in the afternoon of the follow- ing day, on their perilous search for Morgan. They eluded the first line of pickets by crossing fields, thus altogether avoiding the public road. As night was overtaking them, they came,. unexpectedly, on the outer pickets. Retreat or escape was impossible. They were discovered.: already the cry of "Halt!" rung out from the sentinel. "We must trust to finesse and our bottles, Charley." "All right," and the two obeyed the summons, and with a very nonchalant air stood waiting the apyroach of the three pickets that advanced to meet them. "ow d'ye do, friend?" said Irving blandly, stepping forward, and extending his hand to the one in front. The Federal was an Irishman, and quite pleased with Irving's cordial manner, returned the salutation quite heartily. "An' whar is yer pass, friend?" asked the picket, as Charley explained to him that they wished to go beyond the lines for the. purpose of making a little money outof the secesh, "; Oh, we didn't think it was necessary to get a pass-loyal men like ourselves-who are just going out a few miles to sell some little articles by way of turning a penny or two." t "We felt sure we should meet with friends like yourself, and so we brought along a little of the needful," and Irving took out his bottle, and seated himself with perfect sangfroid on an old log by i         '6     122      I  RAIDS AND ROMANCE the wayside, beckoning to the Irishman and his two companions to do likewise. ' I feel pretty tired. Don't you, Michael?" said he, addressing Charley, who by this time had produced his bottle and handed it to the Irishman on his left. "Yaas, an' I do," was the reply, as the bottle was turned up to his mouth, and then passed on. "Any rich secesh below here?" asked Irving of the picket on his right. "Me and Mike want to sell out our little stock as soon as we can, for I left a sick wife at home, and you know it won't do to leave her too long. Have you a family, friend? Here, take a little more; you need it; hard work standing picket," and lhe passed the bottle round. "Pretty good,'" he added, as he put it to his mouth for a second drink. "An' it is, an' shure," said the Irishman next him, who was just ready to apply Charley's bottle for a third drink. "Do you watch all night?" asked Irving, and without waiting for a reply, he turned to Charley and said, "Come, Mike, we can't get on much to-night; let's turn in with our friends here," and he commenced to unstrap his budget, and make preparations for the proposed stay. "Here, boys, you must take a little more. Nothing like it to keep up the spirits these long nights," and the bottle was again passed. "We don't stand here all night; we gets relieved in half an hour," responded a little red-headed Irishman, one of the three who had taken but little part in the scene, save to do duty at the bottle. "' We goes off now, directly." "Well, then, Mike, we'll go on. If we can't have good company here, we had better find a better lodging-place. Any house near, friend? Here, take this, it will help to steady your nerves," and he handed him the bottle. "Maybe you'll go along and show us the way?" "There is a house just a little ahead to the right. Maybe you'll get rest there. We must go back to camp." Irving rebuckled his strap, rose to his feet, swaggered round a few minutes, talking about the horrors of war and the trials of the poor soldier, bade the three friends good-by, expressing a hope they might meet again, and, followed by Charley, walked on, whistling Rory O'More.  "Well done!" said Charley, hen they were out of hearing of the pickets. "We are now safe, thank God and will soon be with Morgan." * II   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        123 "Count no man happy until he ismdead,' said the old philoso- pher, and we cannot count ourselves-safe until with Morgan. How- ever, I regard the greatest danger past. Most of the citizens in lis part of the State are Southel-ners, and should we cross some Yankee sympathizer, we can very readily cajole hin. But, see, yonder is the house. Shall we turn in here, for the night, or drive on a few miles further?" "Turn in, I decide. We are both weary and hungry. Should we go on we may not meet with another housein some distance, and without blankets as we are, we should find it rather disagree- able sleeping out in the dew and chill night-air. I say, run the risk-let's apply at the mansion for supper and lodging."   RlememberI we are peddlers, Irvin," said Charley, as the two gained the front yard gate. "Anddo not forget that a pe dler's chief characteristic is asking high prices and selling for nothing. Ihave no doubt but these people will be glad to get our needles and thread. We must drive a pretty good bargain with them, that they may believe we are really what we profess to be. You must do the trading, Irving. I do not know the price of a single article that we have in our budgets." "Oh, I can do that, Charley. I sold goods for three years, when I was a chap, and I Well remember the price of needles, pins, tapes, combs, etc. I'll multiply thes old prices by six, and then I'll be sure to have them high enough. But if we find these l people true to our cause, and they treat us pretty kindly, we will just make a lumr bargain with them, and gay no smore about it." "That wotld do, Irving, if we were entirely beyond Federal limits. But we n must keep some things to reserve appearances, should we fall into the hands of the blue-coats. And by all means we must hold fast to our bottles, It-will not do to let them slip." "But what will we do with them  now, Charley? They will make us suspicious if they are seen." "Oh, give them to me; I'll secure them," and Charley stepped aside from the pathway that led to the house, and threw the two remaining bottles into a clump of evergreens. "There," said he, 'requiescat in pace until the morning." The two approached the house reacheA the door, and knocked for admittance. After waiting a few minutes, a servant came to the door, who invited them to walk in. "  Ask your mistress if two--shall I say gentlemen or fellows?' whispered Irving to Charley.     124:       RAIDS AND ROMANCE "Peddlers, of course." The negro heard the question, and giggled outright. "Ask your mistress if two peddlers can stay all night." The girl went into her mistress's room, and soon returned, ac- companied by the master of the house. "Walk in, walk in," said the old man, after he had. thoroughly surveyed the two strangers, by the dim light of the flickering can dle. "I see you are no plaguy Yankees. Walk in." After conversing with the old gentleman for a short time, the two dared to inform him who they were. Supper was imine- diately ordered, and partaken of with fine zest by the hungry travellers. The next morning the old gentleman gave them some valuable directions to guide them on their journey. He would receive no compensation, but he was amply rewarded. for his hospitality in the quantity of pins, needles, and thread left with his grateful wife.

AFTER travelling for five days over fields and through lanes and by-roads the two soldiers came, after many delays, upon Morgan's camp just as the men were preparing their supper. The old woods rang with cheers and applause when it was ascertained who the newly arrived visitors were. The boys gathered around Ihving to welcome him bacl again; and as they shook his hand their beaming faces and kind words fully attested the high estimate in which he was held by his con- rades. And Charley, who was known to not a few, was received with the warmest expressions of friendship. How do you do, Charley?" and our young hero felt both hands clasped in kindly gratulation, and recognized the familiar voices of his two old friends, John and Bob. L We thought you were dead, old fellow, picked off by some vile Yankee rifle," said one; "or perhaps had fallen alive into their clutches, and sent to Camp Chase for the improvement of your morals," said another; "or had taken life-long lodgings in some Nashville prison, where we should never be able to visit nor even hear how you were faring, laughingly remarked a third. "You are right, Brent; there's just where I have been accom- modated. But, I am happy to say, not for a lifetime, though it looked very much like it at first." "Tell us all about it, Irving, do-all your experience with the cut-throat Yankees," exclaimed a dozen voices.  "How did you get out, and how have you made your way through to us?" and the boys, forgetting their supper, crowded round him to hear his story. He told them all: how he had been captured in his attempt to get within the Federal lines; of his being accused as a spy, and r without trial offered the alternative of the oath or imprisonment; how he had chosen the latter, but had been made to repent his choice by the wretchedness df his condition and the daily insults ,              '      126       RbAS AND ROMANCE he received; then of his change of purpose, taking the oath, irelease, and subsequent tramp from Nashville to the camp. "Bravo, bravo, lly boy!" filled the air as the hero concluded his narrative. "You have out-Yankeed them. Bravo! bravo for old Kentucky!" pnd tl e boys threw their caps up in the air, and huzzaed, until the whole camp resounded with their cheers. "Why, how you have changed, Charley! We scarcely knew you, old friend. You look pale and thin. But never mind, you'll soon rally again. Come with us," and Lawrenee, taking him by the arm, led him away to his mess, where, amid the aromna of the steaming coffee, and the no'less grateful odor of the smoking fried ham, they too related in turn their hairbreadth escapes since last they parted. Irving reported to Colonel Morgan the success of his undertak- ing, and was informed by the colonel that he should set out on the second day following on an expedition to visit some of the Yankee garrisons.  "Hold yourself in readiness, Irving. I want you to be one of the number." "Certainly, colonel," was the reply; "nothing would give me greater pleasure than to pay off a small portion of the score I have against the Feds." , Charley, who had no idea of being left idle and inactive, imme- diately began preparation for joining the proposed expedition. He went out that evening into the neighborhood of the encampmnent, and through the assistance of his two friends, J-ohn and Bob, who were well known in the vicinity, and who were alheady well provided for, he succeeded in procuring from a friendly farmer a good horse, and Colonel Morgan furnished him with saddle and bridle and arms, so that by nigltfall he was pretty well equipped. The expedition, numbering one hundred and fifty men, headed by their gallant leader, all well mounted and armed, set out the  following morning at daylight. They travelled rapidly all day, and late in the evening came upon Lebanon, where a small le- tachmrent of a Federal regiment was stationed. Their capture was a matter of easy achievement, mere sport for the gallant lads who knew no fear in the presence of the foe. The prisoners were pa- roled, their arms distributed among the captors, and the stores in the place secured. Eveyy thing went "lmerry as a matlriage- bell." Thle boys congratulated each other on their success, and  only regretted that the enemy had yielded without being made to ' taste gunpowder." Horses were fed, stabled, and the victors   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         127 retired to rest after their brilliant coup de main, feeling perfectly secure from all danger.  The night wore on. The weary men slept peacefully. Just as the day was dawning, the alarm rang out. "The enemy is upon us." Men started hastily from their beds and rushed into the streets. Every thing was wild confusion. The order was given by Colonel Morgan to defend themselves and escape as best they could. This, under the suddenness of the surprise, Was all that could be done. Some seized their guns and prepared for the attack; others ran to secure their horses. The enemy, headed by Dumont, drove in upon them in over- whelming numbers. Resistance was useless. Order could not be brought out of the sad confusion that everywhere reigned. They were surprised by thrice their number, and surrounded on all sides by the foe, who pressed in upon them, confident of an easy triumph. Seeing the hopelessness of an attempt at defence, the order was a second time given to cut their way through, ecli  man to depend upon himself for his own safety.  IMorgan mounted his beautiful mare, and, regardless of conse- quences, dashed through the advancing ranks. It was a miracle that lie escaped. His noble animal was shot under him, and it was only by the most reckless daring and courageous self-possession that he saved his life. Some of his men essaying to follow his ex- ample were wounded, others were killed. Among the latter was our young friend Bob, who, in attempting to escape from three Yankees, two of whom he had shot, was struck by a ball in the heart, and fell just as he felt himself securely beyond the range of their guns. Most of those who had succeeded in mounting es- caped, but about eighty fell into the hands of the enemy-among them, sad to say, Charley and Irving. These two men, failing to receiv e the warning in time, hod found it impossible to reach their horses, and had to yield to the umbers who;. rushing upon them, seized them and forced away their arms before they could prepare for any resistance. The prisoners were assembled in a large UL- occupied building, and a strong guard placed round it. "Ho, for Camp Chase," said one of the victors, as they closed the door upon the captives. ' Never for me," said Charley to Irving, his brow darkening and his eye flashing with the thought. "Death, but not Camp Chase."  ' Amen, responded Irving. "A short imprisonment for me, or death to end the scene." I     128        RAIDS AND ROMANCE They could see from the windows of the house in which they were confined their dead comr ades borne along the streets. "There goes poor Bob Reed-dead! dead!" exclaimed Cllrley, starting back from the window at which he had been standing. "I wonder what has become of Lawrelnce and Brent; perhaps they have met the same fate with Reeq," and Charley heaved a bitter sigh, and the tears, despite the #fforts to suppress them, rushed to his eyes.                 ! "Would f were in poor Bob's place," he added after a few mo- ments' silence. I Misfortune attends me on every side. This is my third imprisonment, and I have been in the service but nine months. Better be dead than thus doomed.' As he spoke, his eye rested on the plain gold ring that encircled his finger-Mary's gift-and dashing the unbidden teais away,he settled himself on an old box in the corner of the room and covered his face with his hands. "We'll outwit these infernal Yankees yet. Camp Chase will never have the honor of holding Colonel John Morgan's men, rest assured of that." "You are right, Irving," interposed Cal. Morgan, a younger brother of the colonel. "It will be but rare sport for my brother to rescue us from these scoundrels. I have no mnore fear of Camp Chase than I have of the gallows." But Charley could not feel assured that so happy a fate awaited them. He felt he was doomed, and that it was useless to struggle against his destiny. Dark thoughts entered and took possession of his soul. He could see no light before him. He dwelt on the horrors of his former imprisonment, on the degradation, insult, and suffering that awaited him. "I will never again pass Louisville a prisoner," he said to hitn- self, sadly. "The cold waves of the Ohio shalli roll over me first."  The next day active arrangements were made to convey the men to the river, in order that they might be transported by boat to Cincinnati.

IT was a great trial to these noble spirits to have to submit to imprisonment, aggravated as it was by the coarse taunts and brutal jeers of the unfeeling guard, who appeared to take increased deliglt in tormenting their unfortunate victims, because they were Morgan's men.  The position to these proud Kentuckians was one of the deepest humiliation-one that each man of them had vowed never to oc- cupy. But the alarm was so sudden, the surprise so unexpected and complete, that it was impossible to make any successful resistance. They were overpowered and robbed of their arms almost before they knew the enemy were in the town.' And, to add to their distress, they were told that Colonel Morgan was killed in his attempt to cut his way out. Tllis was to them the saddest feature of the whole matter. Many of them had- confident- ly expected, throughout the long hours of the weary night, that their brave leader would gather together a force, and return 'to their rescue. They felt fully assured that never would one of his men be per- mitted to enter the walls of any Northern prison, if it were in the power of mortal man to avert it. But when they heard that Mor- gan was dead, this hope forsook them, and they saw their inevita- ble doom was protracted imprisonment, unless they could extricate themselves, by their own effort, from their captive condition. It was proposed to bribe the guard, but there were so many difficulties in the way of successful escape, even if beyond the prison walls, as the enemy, in large force, entirely surrounded the tpwn, that this project had to be abandoned. Many favored it; ) among these were Charley and young Irving, who believed there would be comparatively little risk in it. "Do not give yourself any uneasiness, boys," said young Mor- gan, a brother of the colonel, who had listened 'with an air of nonchalance to the animated debate; " my brother is not dead- there is no Yankee bullet that can kill him. Be quiet, and let ;6* [              .            \'     130       IRAIDS AND ROMANCOE things take their way. We'll be attended to in proper time. My life as the forfeit, if we ever pass; the gates of a Yankee prison." "You speak very confidently, Cal.," replied young Irving; "but, for my part, I do not feel quite so well assured. I knew what is before us. I have recently had a bit of experience in -prison life, and I am perfectly willing to dispense with the tender Imercies of the Yankees for all future time. I vote for bribing the guard." "We have only a hundred and fifty dollars, all told, Irving- not two dollars apiece-and it is folly to talk bf bribing the guard with that meagre sum. Moreover, he would not dare to let us all go, and who among us would be willing to remain? And even if we were out, the great probability is that half of us would be caught again. I think we had better remain together, and when the time comes, our combined force can strike a heavy blow." "Thou reasonest well, Cal., my friend, and we will I ave to decide the question by vote. All favoring the plan of briling the guard, hold up the right hand." "Only twenty. The majority is against us, Charley. Li e good democrats, we will yield to i s voice." - Charley assented, but it was in 'sadness. "The bitter/ fruit of taking that oath," lie murmured to himself, and turned to' the win- dow to look out. The house opposite had been appropriated to the slain. It was through that faded brown door that he had seen the dead bol v of his friend borne. "I wish I was in poor Bob's place," he said again to himself, as he gazed fixedly at the old frame house. Tears rushed to his eyes, but quickly he dashed them away-he would not be seen ,unnerved--lnd commenced to hum  the air of "iAuld Lang Syne." It was a most unfortunate selection. It brought to his sad heart cherished and touching memories. It was Mary's favorite air, and many an hour he had sat beside her listening to the sweet music of its variations, which she performed with exquisite taste and skill. The lovely girl, who had risked so much for him, to secure whose happiness lie felt no sacrifice was too great-home, with all its tender associations-came before him, and, in spite of him- self, the big tears would flow. He looked at the delicate gold ring, the pledge of love. I will live for her sake," he said to himself, "for her, the idol of my heart, the light, the star of my life," and he choked down his emotion, nerved hisl heart, and began to whistle in a lively manner, "Cheer, boys, cheer."  It was known among the prisoners that they were to leave   OF MORGAN AND HS 'MEN.        131 early the following roo'ning for Nashville-whether to proceed from there by boat or railroad, they could not learn. "It doesn't matter, boys, how they start us on our way to Yan- keedom. We'll never reach there. The stars may fall, or the Yankee nation turn respectable, but never will any of us breathe the-air of their infernal Northern slaughter-pens." "Hope you are right, Cal.,' ejaculated all present. "My head for a foothall, if I have not spoken truly." The next day the prisoners, eighty in number, were sent to Nashville, there to take boat for Cincinnati, the rumor having obtained among the enemy that Colonel Morgan intended to release his men at all hazards, if sent by rail. I ' i      132        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER XXIV.     / /   AN EPISODE.  THE operator sat in his office silent and grum. He had just completed the forwarding of a dispatch from Louisville to Nash- ville, relative to Morgan's captured men, to the, efect that they must be sent immediately to the former city by rail. The r ason assigned was that Morgan could at any time enter Naslville,\and, with the assistance he would there obtain from rebel sympathizers, could force,the prison and liberate the prisoners. Confound Morgan and his men!" said the operator to himself; biting his lips in rage. "I wish the last one of them was at Old Nick this very minute. They are always doing some devilment to make trouble. Who knows but what they may pounce down on me some of these days, and take me off to some of their cursed prisons? ConfoUnd the whole batch of them, I say. I wish I had Morgan here; I'd soon put an end to his villany-the cursed rebel P! Just at this j ncture of the soliloquy, a horseman alighted in front of the dor, and, with whip in hand, walked carelessly in. The Surly operator scarcely raised his head to speak to the in- truder, as he caught a glimpse of his butternut suit, all bespat- tered with mud, and the old slouched hat with rim partly torn off. But the visitor was not to he repulsed by this very uncivil recep- tion. Stepping forward towards a vacant chair, which stood be- side the window in the further side of the room, he seated himself, and asked for the news. "No news," was the curt reply. There was a morning Journal on the desk. The stranger reached out his hand, and, with the most perfect sangfroid, took the paper, and, opening it, commenced to read. "John Morgan at work again," he said, as he glanced down the first column; " great pity that man can't be cOught -he plays the wild with every thing." ,At the mention of Morgan's name, the operator, as if suddenly seized by his Satanic Majesty himseif, sprang from his ohr, /          I   OF MORGAN  AND HS MEN.    .   33 doubled up his fist, and then with a sudden jerk withdrawing it again, as if practising the pugilistic art on some hapless victim, and then thrusting his arm out at full length, while his eyes darted vengeful fire, exclaimed: "Yes, the scoundrel, villain-I wish I had him here. I'd blow his brains out, this very moment. I'd show him. Just let hin I;  come in reach of me, and he'll soon get a ball put through his cursed body. No mnore pranks from him, the mighty John Mor- gan, I tell you!"And the infuriated man went through all the gestures of shooting his hated foe. ," You wouldn't ill him, would you?" asked the stranger, g   quietly looking up from his paper, and lifting the torn brim of his old white. hat. "Kill him? aye, and I would, sooner than I'd shoot a mad dog. I just dare him, at any time, to cross that door, and if he isn't a dead man in five minutes, there's no truth in me." The stranger rose, took off his hat, and stood before the blood- thirsty operator, and with a quiet mien and voice gentle as a maiden's, said: "I am John Morgan, sir; execute your threat. Here is a pistol-you are entirely welcome to use it!" \ As he spoke, he fixed his large, piercing eyes steadfastly on the operator. Every feature of that noble face bespoke daring and al   defiance. "Here is a pistol, use it!"  "Oh! thank you; H-didn't know-I hadn't any idea- that you were-Colonel Morgan, sir-indeed I didn't-beg pardon, sir-so much annoyed to-day-every .thing gone topsy-turvy. Man gets so fretted-excuse me-really didn't mean what I said- wouldn't have any man's blood on my conscience-oh, no-re- member the commandment-thousand pardons, sir-hope you'll forgive"-and the frightened man bowed himself quite back to the wall, where he stood, pale and trembling. ' TYou have my pardon, sir," replied Morgan, in a firm, gentle- manly tone. "Another time I advise you to be less boastful of your courage and veracity. I have but little time to stay. Seat yourself, and send the messages that I shall dictate to Louisville. Make no mistake; if you do, your life is the forfeit." The bewildered man, but too glad to escape so easily, obeyed the order of the colonel with' alacrity. "I understand this operation, sir; don't you attempt to give any information but what'I instruct you to do." / *             . '-     134        RAIDS AND ROMANCE Had the trembling man felt disposed to disobey the warning, the close proximity to his headI/of that formidable pistol would have forever lulled all such desire. "Now," said Colonel Morgan, " show me all the dispatches that have passed through this office in the last twenty-four hours." The man sprang from his seat, and with a most obsequious air obeyed the bidding. "That will do, sir," said Morgan, bowing politely, and bidding the pusillanimous wretch "Gool-morning." Reaching his horse, he mounted, and rode away, leaying the confused operator dumb with wonder and surprise at the strange and startling occurrence. It was a beautiful Sabbath morning in May, 1862. Lovely as a poet's dream rested the flower-mantled earth beneath the soft warm sunlight. The cars, laden with passengers, were wending their way at full speed from Louisville tH Bpwling Green. There was to be a "Union mass-meeting" in Nashville the following day, and the iealots of Kentucky, ]determined that it should have at least the appearance of powe-, and its proceqdings be noised  abroad through the land, had turned out in numbers to attend /it. There were on board politici ns, speculatorsi Federal officers, curiosity seekers, and hangers-on, besides a few private travellers. Prentice, of the "Journal," mad fully purposed to be present, but "owing," as one of his friends said to another, "to the fuddled condition of his brain, he was unable to make the time, and most unfortunately for the incidents of the day, was left be- hind."  The whistle had sounded, and the train was slowly nearing the depot at COve City, when a dozen arme( horsemen suddenly ap- pearing in front of the locomotive, called out "Halt!" accompany- ing the command with a wave of the hand, a signal to the ergineer to stop. This functionary appearing but little inclined to obey the order -his movements indicating a determination to proceed-the com- mand Iwas repeated, and at the same moment about thirty other horsemen, armed to the teeth, dashed in view, and dozens of bul- lets shredded the air, whizzing alarmingly about the ears of the frantic passengers. "Morgan! Morgan!" was uttered by a dozen voices. "Mor- gan! Morgant" was caught up apd re-echoed by all. Then fol- lowed a scene of the wildest confusion, which was at the same time both ludicrous and serious. !   OF MORGAN AND HS JWn.        135 The engineer now seeing the folly of attempting to proceed, quickly brought the cars to a stand-still. Some of the horsemen immediately sprang from their saddles to'obstruct the track with rails,; lest he should reverse the cars, and endeavor to return to Elizabethtown. Others rode up to the side of the cars, and, with pistols presented, demanded a full surrender of all soldiers and freight belonging to the government. Wild was the tumult among the loyal ladies, profound the panic that had seized officers, politicians, and speculators. Each was endeavoring as best he could to secure his own safety and interest. Private purses rapidly passed from the hands of loyal men to those of disloyal ladies, in order to preserve them from the hands of the rebels. Amid the fright and confusion Colonel Morgan entered the ladies' car. As he stood for a moment, every eye was fixed upon him.  "Be quiet, ladies," said he, with a pleasant smile, as their cries of terror fell upon his ear." Be quiet, none of you shall be hurt, I only want the blue-coated gentlemen." Instantly there was profound silence. His words acted like a spell in calming the tumult. He approached one of the " blue-coated gentry," whose wife sat beside -him. "Oh, spare my husband, Colonel Morgan! IDon't take him from me," screamed out the frightened wife. "For God's sake, don't take him. Have mercy-mercy on me, colonel, and spare him to me. I appeal to you as a gentleman--to your cle"mency- your generosity-your kindness-for my sake, for God's sake, for the sake of mercy, don't take him away." "I do not wish to take your husband from you, madam," he replied, amused at the woman's importunity. "Take him your- self, and teach him better behavior than to come down here to    kill Southern people. This is all I ask. Will you promise me this?"  The grateful woman, in the joy of her heart, grasped the knees I   of the noble benefactor, and thanked him in the most passionate strains. A low-browed Dutchman, who had been a music teacher in Lexington, Kentucky, but who now enjoyed the most impressive sobriquet of Major Helveti, was taken by some of the Louisville boys from the cars, mounted upon a shabby trotting mule, and spirited away under an escort in the direction of Dixie. /     136        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "I have thirty thousand dollars in that safe," said the cotton agent of one of the large firms in Louisville, to Colonel Morgan, who was quietly examining Uncle Sam's treasures. "It is private funds, colonel. I hope it will not be appropriated. Here is my receipt for its deposit from the agent, colonel." "Give yourself no uneasiness, sir," was the quiet response, while Colonel Morgan continued his operations. "My men are not thieves. Be assured, not one cent of private property shall be touched." After making such disposition of government funds and stores as he deemed proper, Colonel Morgan surrendered the cars to the conductor, under strict orders to return to Louisville without attempting to proceed to Bowling Green. Colonel Morgan, with his force, inmmediately dashed down the road to the depot below, to intercept the upward train, on board of which were his men, proceeding to Louisville. Unfortunately for his plan, a courier, unobserved by him, had left the scene of action during the melee, and reaching the nearest depot below, had telegraphed to the conductor, by all means, to retulrn to Nashville, as Morgan and his men were awaiting the train to seize it. Sad were the hearts of the prisoners, as the cars reversed their mbvement, and steamed back to Nashville. They understood it al in a moment, and felt that all escape by liberation at the hands of their noble chief was at an end. Their disappointment and chagrin were unspeakable. There was no hope left them now, sa e in their own skill and management. But they did not de- spair. They were determined on one thing-and that was, come life or death, they would never enter a Northern dungeon. How they succeeded in averting this detested fate remains to be seen.  f   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        137 CHAPTER XXV. HOW THE PROPOSED PLAN SUCCEEDED. PLAYED out-played out, boys!" said Charley, despondingly. "No hbpe of rescue now-prison or death--we must choose be- tween the two." "There, Charley, croaking again. Why, my boy, this is only a pleasing variety. What is life without diversity? Come, cheer up! be a hero-with a heart for any fate. If Colonel Morgan doesn't rescue us, we'll rescue ourselves. That's all." "You are very hopeful, to be sure. You have had no experience in prison. Wait until you have groaned beneath their iron rule for a few months. Then we shall see if you regard it as a pleasing diversity." "But there's no use despairing, even in the face of the most unpromising circumstances. Be patient. My word on it, Morgan will outwit these Yankees yet. They will not dare to keep us here in Nashville. Why, they wouldn't even risk us in Louisville. Don't you know that these cowardly wretches believe that Mor- gan can do just what he pleases? I'll wager they are trembling now for fear he will rush upon them and spirit us away. They will never feel safe until we are beyond the Ohio river." "But what does all this argue? Simply that they won't im- prison us here." "And that they will have to ship us to Camp Chase. And you know it's a long way from here to Cincinnati, and there will be many chances for us to escape. I, for one, will never see thein- side of one of their dens, take my word for that. Indeed, I liave a great mind to dodge them right here in Nashville. But then, it would be so much trouble to get out of their lines; and, more- over, I shouldn't like to leave any of my friends behind me." "They will take us by boat now, I suppose," said Charley, his voice assuming a rather more cheerful tone. "Oh, yes! that will be their plan. They will not try railroad shipment again, and they won't dare to keep us here; so you see there is no other alternative." /     138        RA IDS ANsp ROMANCE The prisoners were marclhed from the depot, and huddled to- gether in the close, damp jail for the night, without supper and without beds. The next day they were taken on board a small boat, lying at the wharf, to le sent to Clarksville, where they were to be trans- ferred to a large vessel, and forwarded immediately to Cincinnati. It was night-a soft May night. Tle young moon, from amid her" throng of starry worshippers, beamed tenderly down on the sleeping earth, which lay reposing in her soft, warm rays like a glad babe on its mother's loving bosom. The radiant stars looked down with their spiritual eyes from out their far-off home in the blue vault above. And gentle breezes, wooed into life by the moon's soft kiss, sported caressingly among the fragrance-breathing flowers. It was the hour of midnight. Over the still bosom of the Cum-l berland, the cliffs, with their wooded brows, threw a deep, dark shadow, here and there lighted up by the sparkling modnbeams as they stole through the young and tender foliage of the over- hanging forests, and fell in streams of silver sheen on the rippling waters.  lNo sound was heard, save the low, irregular splashing of the waters, as the wheel of the little boat drove the tiny craft along over the river's still, smooth bosom. "Now is our time," said Morgan, quickly, yet stealthily, ap- proacling the spot where young Irving and Charley were stand- ing on the guard, looking over into the river below. "Pass the signal; let each man but do his part, and we are free. You and Charley will attend to disarming the drunken guard. You, Irving, pass the word." The signal was given. Quietly, yet with liglttning-speed, the prisoners hastened to the work assigned them. The officers and boat-hands were seized, and before they couldl recover from their consternation, they were bound and put under guard. The sen- tinels, overcome by too deep libations from rebel bottles, lay sense- less on the guards. To relieve them of their arms, was but the work of a moment. It was a daring undertaking,-one that required great tact and adroitness. But the plan had been well arranged, apd its denoue- ment was eminently successful. 1 The captain plead to be released, offering to convey them to any point on the river, if tley would only allow him to keep his boat.  "On these conditions," said young Morgan, "'you must surren-   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        139 der to us all the arms you have; give us rations for two days; all the money you have in your safe; them land us above here, on the east bank of the river, and we will spare your life and release your boat. But as you value your head, captain; don't you at- tempt to trick us in any way. And another thing, you must go on to darksville, and remain there until we shall have time to get beyond danger. Will you promise me this?" The captain, but too glad to save his head on any terms, readily assented to the proposition. "' Swear him," said Irving; " swear him, Morgan. Excuse me, sir," he added, turning to the captain; "but you Yankess have such unreliable memories. The penalty for perjury under our oath is death at first sight. You'll remember?; -Here, Charley, get out your Bible, and let the captain take the oath on that." The little pocket-book was produced, and the captain duly sworn.  "Now, go with us, boss, and give directions to: your engineer to wheel about and take us back a few miles; after ,this, sir, we will attend to the pantry and money-box; Boys, lkep a sharp look- out over your prisoners, and if these drunken isoldiers dare to move, just throw them overboard."  Tle necessary directions were given to the engineer. The safe was then visited, and relieved of its treasures; after which, Mor- gan, calling to his aid a number of the boys, stormed the pantry, and emptied it of its edibles.           , "Come, cook," said he to the mulatto, wholwhad stood beside him eyeing the movement with a look of wonder, mingled with admiration; "come, be quick, get to work iminediately, and fry these steaks and this ham, and make up all that flour and meal into bread. Here, boys, you that-know how, fall to work and grind this coffee, slice the' light-bread and butter it, and roll up sandwiches for yourselves-here's a nice cold ham. Each one take as much sugar and tea as he wants."  "Come, steward, bring paper to these gentlemlen."' None on board, sir, I believe," and the darlkey trembled with friht at lhaving to disobey orders. "Well, well, never mind. Get your towels and tablecloths; no matter what, so it will do to wrap up victuals in." The steward 'darted lik lightning, and in a moment was back with the necessary articleS. There was a general jubilee on board the boat. The boys laughed, and danced, and sung. They had not had such a merry time     "O        RAIDS AD ROMANCE since the fated night at Lebanon. Morgan, Charley, and Irving took the management of affairs upon themselves, and superintend- ed all the preparations. Every thing was carried forward with the greatest dispatch. The pilot was commanded to land them at the first safe. point on the eastern bank of the river. Just as day was dawning over the earth, the boat was rounded to, and the boys, enforcing remembrance of their instructions on the captain and crew, equip- ped themselves with the few arms they had obtained, secured their edibles, and with one long, loud, ringing shout, sprang from the boat, and dashed into the woods. "Didn't I tell you that we would out-general these Yankees?" said young Morgan to Charley, as he stepped up to his side, and slapped him on the shoulder. "But you wouldn't believe me. Did I not speak truly?" "'You did. Your plan has succeeded well, and you deserve all praise. We are once more free, thank God. Never let us again fall into the enemy's hands." "Ah, we will never be caught napping agair, Charley. Eter- nal vigilance is the price of liberty these days. How would it do, Irving, for; us all to Ivow that we will never be taken prisoners again? What say you, Charley?" "Amen, amen!" respondedthe two young men. "Come to a halt, Morgan," said Charley, " and let us all swear that the Yankees shall never again claim us as captives."  The column was halted, the proposition submitted to the men, which was received with loud and protracted cheers, throughout the whole line. The oath was administered, Irving holding up the small pocket- Bible, upon which each man was commanded to look, while he re- peated the form of words after young Morgan. "What do you say to breakfast now, boys, and a division of our money? Come forward, treasurer, and disburse your funds per  capita." A young man stepped forward from the ranks, and drew forth from his pocket a roll of notes.  "Two hundred and forty dollars-just three dollars apiece. Come forward, boys, and each one receive his quota." A c uncil of war was then called to decide whether the com- pany should divide into squads, and thus endeavor to make their way to Colonel Morgan, or should, en masse, proceed to join him. The subject was gravely discussed, pro and con.  Of '                  i   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        141 "Most of us know every mile of this country," said Irving, the chief speaker. "We have travelled over it often. It is inhabited only by friends. We have provisions enough to last us twenty- four hours, and if at the expiration of that time we shall find it expedient, in order to procure fo6d,l to divide out, we can do so." "But perhaps we shall encounter the Feds," suggested the treasurer,-"and we llave not arms enough to defend ourselves." "That is not at all probable, Carter. There are no Yankees in 'this section. You know that we have kept them too badly scared to venture out in small squads, and if they have thrown a large force anywhere near, We will soon learn it. Let us send out an advance whose duty it' will be to apprise us of any danger ahead." 1' Boys, all in favor of moving on together, call out aye," said he, leaving it to the decision of a vote. ' Aye," rang out from every man. About an hour was spent in eating breakfast, which was greatly enlivened by the recital of many a laughable incident that occurred while taking possession of the boat. The old woods were reso- nlnt with their mirth and hilarity, as they ate of their fried ham 1and steaks, with the buttered light-bread and fresh biscuits. It was far superior fare to any they had enjoyed in a long while, and their heightened appetite did ample justice to its acknowledged merits. "Well, boys," said Irving, rising, and depositing the remainder of his roll in his pocket, " if we are through with breakfast, we'll take up our line of march. Our course is southeast. The 6um- berland may give us some trouble, but we will' find friends who will assist us, and we shall soon make our way to Morgan. Three cheers for our colonel, boys!" and the speaker flourished his old white hat vigorously around his head. The example was followed by every man, and loud and lusty cheers went up from the mov- ing column, which were echoed and re-echoed among the leafy recesses of the forest until they gradually died away in the dis- tance. /          "2        RADS AND ROMANoE CHAPTER XXVI. FINDING MORGAN. THE party travelled a day and a half before they could obtain any reliable intelligence of Colonel Morgan's whereabouts. They were then informed that he had a few days before passed within twenty miles of Carthage, going north. They could not 'earn whether he was accompanied by his whole force or not. Th 3 ru- mors were conflicting. One story said that he had certainly gone to Gallatin; another, that he had undoubtedly proceeded to Xen- tucky.                      / "If we cannot overtake Colonel Morgan," said Irvingl after listening to the various contradictory rumors that met them on every side, "-wd must go where he can find us; Our present busi- ness is to get beyond the reach of the Federals. We can then wait until we can ascertain where he is. This done, our troubles are at an end." They marched on for two successive days. No certain intelli- gence of Morgan could be gained. Hearing of no enemy in that portion of the State, they decided to halt and establish a camp. A fine position was selected for this purpose in a skirt of woods, bounded by a beautiful stream. Theyl purchased such necessary articles as their limited means would allow. The people in the neighborhood of the encampment generously assisted them with provisions and blankets. After remaining a few days here, and ascertaining nothing of Colonel Morgan, it was proposed to pro- cure some horses, and start a party in search of him.. The propo- sition was favorably received by the whole encampment, and Irving, Charley, young Curd, and Johnson were selected to go,- Morgan remaining behind to look after the camp. He had already become quite popular in the neighborhood, partly because he was a brother of the favorite hero of the West, but quite as much on account of his agreeable manner and daring spirit. The project was made known to a few of the farmers, who readily furnished horses and every thing necessary for their equipment. The outfit was complete, and the four set forward on their search, under O      I  !     .      OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        143 the direction they had received. After a day's travel northward, they obtained such intelligence of Colonel Morgan's recent move- ments as they could credit. Two days more, and they had reach- ed his camp.     / Information was given him of all that had occurred. He had heard, while passing through the country from Cave City to his headquarters via Knoxville, that his men had escaped. Immedi- ately he turned about, and sent ip into the region of Clarksville, for the purpose of rendering them assistance; but he was too late, and learned on reaching there that they had set out on foot to overtake him. He dispatched Irving, Curd, and others back to the camp for their comrades, with instructions for as many as could to join him immediately. "1 a                    !     ' "4        R i RAIDS AND ROMANCE !/         , I      CCHAPTER XXVII. THE DARK SHADOW.  THE morning after the men reached Colonel Morgan's encamp- me t, Charley was very leisurely sauntering around objectless, further than to indulge his general habit of activity, when, in pass- ingMnear a clump of undergrowth on the outskirts of the camp, his attention Was arrested by the earnest voice of solne one who seeCned to be reading. As he neared the spot from whence the soind proceeded, he heard the speaker pronounce the name of Mary Lawrence. Suddenly he paused, as if transfixed to the s4ot. The blood mounted to his temples-his heart beat audibly his frame grew, rigid under the power of his strong emotion. A momnent mdre, and the name of Arthur Morton reached his ear,  then the words "Federal officer," and "undivided attention." As one who is suddenly seized by some demoniac passion, he exclaimed, ' Oh, my God!" and sprang forward. Then, as if im- pelled by the magic of an invisible power, he paused ant strained his ears to listen. It was the voice of young Brent, who was evi- dently reading a letter from some friend in Louisville. As Charley stood breathless-trembling in every nerve, his hands clenched in the agony of dreadful "ap'prehension, while his fade, which for a moment before was crimson, was now livid as death, his bloodless lips apart as one who listens with his soul as well as ears-these maddening words were plainly heard\; Rumor says they are to be married. I do not myself know, fdr I have not seen Mary in many weeks."             '  He could bear no more.  Frenzied, he turned and rushed away, walking as if pursued by a demon. "Where on earth are you going, at that break-neck speed, Char- ley?" hallooed young Lawrence to him, as with great strides he pushed by the spot where a group had gathered around- Captain Hawkins to hear him read a Louisville Journal, which had found its vay into the camp. Charley paused, and looked wildly around. "Come here, Charley," exclaimed a dozen voices. "Come, and J   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.     / '145 hear," added young Lawrence, ' what old Prentice says about our capture at Lebanon. He gloats over the idea of our surprise and imprisonment. Little does the old wretch think we are here free as air, laughing over his fiendishness." Charley, as if incapable of exercising his own will, obeyed the summons, but it was as one who acts devoid of thought and object. He took his place amid the group, listless; as one in a strange, wild dream, he stood, his eyes gazing out into vacuity-his face wearing that peculiarly sad expression which results from sudden grief; while his heart-ah, how can we describe its tumultuous I heavings! "Look, boys, Charley lives the whole scene over again!" ex- claimed young Morgitn. "He is even now, in thought and feeling, the inmate of a Yanlee prison. Indeed, Charley, my friend, you do not regard yours lf safe fromu the clutches of the villains, do you '" and Morgan slapped him on the shoulder pleasantly. Come, this won't do. You are as free as the bird of the wildwood-as safe, Charley, as though all the Yankees had been ferried over Styx by the good Charon, who of late must have been kept very busy at his work." "No, no, Oal., I have no fear of the Yankees. (I have seen them too often, and am too familiar with their face," responded Char- ley, endeavoring to assume an air of cheerfulness. "Then why so melancholic? Disappointed that you did not get a letter from home, eh?" "Yes, partly that; and partly indisposition." "Oh, you mustn't get sick, Chalrley," interposed young Law- rence. "We are going to make Louisville a visit soon." "Just at this point in the conversation, Captain Hawkins, who had been silently scanning the paper, read aloud one of Prentice's witticisms, which caused them all to break out in a fit of the most uproarious laughter. Charley essayed to join them; out what a mockery to laugh, when the heart is breaking! His effort was fruitless-only a wan, ghastly smile was the result. Attracted by the shouting, Brent and his cousin, young Arnold, to whom he had been reading his letter, came rushing to the group, Brent holding the yet open letter in his hand.. As Charley looked towards the young men, who were advancing at full speed, crying out, l"What's the joke? what's the joke? Do let us share it?" he perceived the unfolded sheet. His first im- pulse was to meet Brenf, and ask him to permit him to read his     "6        RAIDS AND ROMANCE y' letter. But this would necessarily involve the betrayal of his , ? secret, and, restraining hilmself, he simply said to young Brent, in ! passing, "One of Prentice's lucky hits, that's all," and walked on  in the direction of the woodland which flanked the encampInent. Seeking its cool recesses, he seated himself upon an old log, around which the mushrooms had thickly grown, and burying lis  face in his hands, gave himself up to the tortures of the demon j jealousy. And who that has felt his wasting fires, consuming, as   it were, the very life of the soul, but can exclaim, "Death, deathl, : give me death!"So felt Charley. IThe world to him was one wide-spread void, over which rested the blackness of darkness.' Despair, deep, fearful, had unfolded her sombrous wings over his  X heart, shutting out all hope-all joy. Gladly would he have lost  i his weary weight of anguish in that long sleep where dreams do never come. He prayed for the fierce conflict, that he might yield up that life which in a few short hours had become to him only a ! meaningless existence. There are moments in life when the soul, bowed down beneath its weight of disappointment and despondence, fearfully strives to discern one gleam of hope, to find one promise of good, in all the vast universe spread out so illimitably around it. It turns to present, past, and future-but ah, how vainly! and the recoil uponI itself is btt the mightier for the effort made.            In such moments, did the will but control the pulsations of the heart, what an array of self-murderers would stand in the last day before the final tribunal!                  :I After remaining in this frenzied frame of mind, more intolerable :: than that which prompted the beautiful priestess of Venus to   i throw herself into the deep, dark sea, our hero arose, determined i  to seek out young Brent, obtain the letter, and if it confirmed his : fearful apprehensions, to procure a furlough and leave immediately  for Kentucky, and if his troth had been betrayed, to wipe out the  wrong in the blood of the hated rival.     - He sought the camp. But, as le bent his steps thitherward, his resolution began to falter. He could not make known the  secret of his love to another; and how could the letter be pro- cured without an explanation that must necessarily lead to dis-  closure on this point? He racked his brain for a plan, but the  i knot couild not be untied-he had not determination 'to cut it asunder. So, avoiding young Brent, whom he met midway the      i inclosure, he turned aside with agitated look, and passed on with i rapid pace towards his own tent. *a   OF MORGAN AND )  IS MEN.       14:7 The evening and night were passed amid the tortures of jealousy and despair. Sleep visited not the restless, tossing frame, and the aching brain, racked with fearful thought, throbbed wildly, while the blood-shot eyes looked out into the glqom of the rayless tent strainingly, as if the sinking soul sought to Catch some ray of hope from the outer world. It was the small hours of the morning be- fore that exhaustion consequent upon such intense and continued excitement of mind induced a fitful, feverish slumber; and this un- satisfying rest was haunted by fearful dreams, wherein specters of frightful f)rm and fiercest mien unrelentingly pursued hini through all the winding way, from which he saw on way of escape. He awoke to a realization of his wretchedness, and, springing to his feet, rushed frantically into the open air, and .paced back and forth before his tent, goaded on by the increasing intensity of his emotion. The morning came, but morning brought no relief. Pale and dejected, he pursued his walk. "Why, Charley, you look sick to-day 1" exclaimed his mess- mates, as he seated himself to attempt a breakfast. He made no reply, but, sipping his coffee listlessly, and scarcely partaking of the bread and fried ham before him, he sat silently brooding over his grief.                 "Why, Charley, my friend, what is the matter with, you?" re- marked young Lawrence, with manifest astonishment, as returning from guard he seated himself at the mess-table. "You look as if the Furies had been tormenting you. Are you suffering from the scorpion whip of conscience for not going to church yesterday?" "I slept but badly last night, and this morning my head aches violently. Altogether, I am not well," replied our hero, endeavor- ing to rally himself, so as to avoid renewed inquiry and remark; but the effort was futile-the smile too painfully sad. 4 "Oh, indeed, you must rally. It will not do to get sick, now. Rlumor says we go into Kentucky in a few days. Come, let's go and see some pretty girls to-day; that is, if we get permission. A sweet face is always a sovereign catholicon for the blues. Come, what say you? I saw several interesting demoiselles yesterday at the old country church, and two of them live near here. Hughes, there, fell in love with one, and Brent with the other." "Not in love at all, Charley. 'Lawrence is exaggerating. We admired the young ladies; they were quite beautiful, I assure you; bu+ far me, I must wed a Kentucky girl, or die a Benedict." "You are right, Hughes; I say so too. A Kentucky girl for     X me. They are the fairest and best of all earth's daughters, and ]     I 148       RAIDS AND ROMANCE               I one of them for me or none," exclaimed Brent, accompanying the .X ri remark with a very enthusiastic gesticulationr-which upset the cup { A; of hot coffee on his knee, and imminently endangered the break- fast table, which was a camp-stool; and notwithstanding it boasted of four legs, instead of three, they were so unsteady as to jeopard- ize its uprightness under a sudden smart blow.  The boys roared with laughter at poor Brent's plight, which was really not enviable, as the hot 'bffee was by no means a pleasantH douche. Charley joined in the merriment, for a mnoment forgetting , his woe, but it was like the fitful gleam .of sunlight bursting through the slightly riven cloud.  "Irving," said Charley to his friend, as soon as he could meet  him after breakfast," I wish you to take a walk wi/th me; I have something to tell you."              : "I hope you are not in trouble, Charley, though one to see you would imagine you had again fallen into the hands of the Yankees,  you look so grief-stricken. I will walk with you in a few minutes,  just as soon as I can deliver this note to Major Duke. Wait here,"  and Irving passed rapidly on, and in a very short time returned : I to rejoin Charley.' The two walked towards the dense woodland which flanked the rear of the encampment. Seated on the old log,  around,whch the mushrooms had gathered, with the sweet mnusic  of spring-birds gushing out from amid the dense overhanging foli- age, Charley unbosomed his grief to his friend.  "I trust you, Irving, because I feel I can rely on your sympa- thy and finesse. I must obtain that letter from Brent, at all haz- ard. Would you undertake to procure it for me, pledging me to  keep my secret most fiducially?"  "I think so. Trust me, I will not betray you. If possible, I will secure the letter this evening. Join mne about four o'clock, and we will together find Brent; and if I succeed in my purpose, you can eitlher read it, or hear it read."  The two parted;-Charley to attend to his daily duties, and find, i as best he might, relief from his goadink grief; while Irving, who ; had been intrusted with the secret of the expedition so soon to be undertaken, was busily engaged in such preparations as were neces- sary for the purpose of carrying out the commands of the morning. ! A Punctually, at the designated hour, Charley sought Irving. He  I  found him earnestly engaged in a conversation with Hawkins, one - of the command upon whom Colonel Morgan greatly relied in all  l matters that required energy and tact.  Pausing beneath the shade of a tree against which he leaned i ;   /   i OE MORGAN AND HS MEN.         149 with the air of one aweary, Charley awaited his friend. A few minutes, and he was by his side, and the two set out to overtake Brent. Their search was for some time unrewarded. At length he was seen with Lawrence and Hughes, emerging from the lane which led from the encampment into the main road. 1"We are just from seeing the young ladies with whom these gallants fell in love yesterday," said Lawrence to Charley, as the two met, "L and I do wish you could have been there to have wit- nessed the gaucherie of these noble Kentuckians. It would have cured you of your blues eternally. It was serio-comic, I assure you."  "No such thing, boys; Lawrence is exaggerating the whole affair. We conducted ourselves right nobly, like gentlemen to the manor born. Didn't we, Hughes?" "Undoubtedly. Lawrence embarrassed us by telling the ladies we had fallen most deeply in love with them at first sight, and would not wait longer than to-day to make a call, when really, as you know, Chllarley, we went at his most earnest persuasion. Didn't Brent and I declare this morning that none but a daughter of Kentucky should capture us?" tL Oh, that vow, lilkewoman's, 'was traced in sand.' Charley, you and Irving would so decide, could you have but seen the earnest, lohv- ing looks, and heard the soft, tender words which were inflicted upon those two beautiful Tennessee damsels, by these amorous swains." Come, Brent," said Irving, taking him by the arm, and lead- ing him off, "come with me. You must make confession. I chance to know, gentlemen, something of this gallant knight's lady love," said Irving, looking back over his shoulder, and addressing the trio, now heartily laughing at something said by Lawrence. "Your company, boys, if you please," and Charley left Hughes and Lawrence, and hastened to follow Irving and Brent, who were seek- ing a rude seat which the boys had constructed beneath a large oak tree, and to which they had given the name of My Lady's Bpwer. "Is she your sweetheart?" were the words that met Charley, as'he found himself beside Irving. It was an inquiry of surprise from Brent. 'Oh, no," replied the young man; "'not exactly a sweetheart, but a young lady in whom, from my first acquaintance, I have felt a deep interest. I knew her in Lexington,.and she is tho sweetheart of one of my particular friends." "Is Mort on, of Louisville, a friend of yours, Irving? Do' you know he is now in the Federal army? He and Miss Lawrence are to be married soon."'     150        RAIDS 4ND ROMANCE                 C "Married to young Morton, BrentI That cannot be. She is,     : undoubtedly, engaged to a young friend of mine. There must be   L some mistake. I Where did you get your information? Surely, it   : can be nothing more than rumor."       ,           g During this conversation, Charley's face was flushed almost to  i crimson. His pulse throbbed violently.               X "Oh, no; it is not mere rumor. A letter just received from    i my sister in Louisville, says the marriage is certainly to take place." X Charley clutched young Irving's arm convulsively. "I should like to see the statement, Brent. As you may well   ' conceive, I feel a deep interest for this friend of mine, who I know . X to have acted honorably and sincerely throughout; Would there  be any impropriety in my reading herain the presence of our friend,  Charley, as much of the letter as is pertinent tothe subject?" "None in the world. I will step to the tent and get the letter.  You and Charley remain here."e . Charley had scarcely time to request his friend to read the paragraph carefully and a second time, before Brent returned and   i handed him the letter, pointing out the fearful passage. Irving. took it, read it slowly to himself, and, shaking his head rather  ominously, began to read aloud :* "Oh, I had almost neglected to mention," the young girl wrote to her brother, "l the strangest item of news, and one that creates the greatest sensation among our young friends. It is said, and generally believed, that Mary Lawrence and Fred. Morton are to   , be married very soon. Lizzie Hutton told me yesterday there was no doubt of it. And you know Mary and Lizzie are old friends. Yet I scarcely know how to credit the statement, I have so often heard Mary declare she would not marry a Union man, if her life depended upon it. And Fred. Morton is now a Federal officer, dressed in his uniform. I met him on the street this morning. : We passed without speaking. You know I have no admiration  for blue-coats, and so I dropped my, veil as I approached him. I  iJ do not think he recognized me. I have not seen Mary myself for   i weeks.

I cannot believe it unless she informs me of it herself, even  if rumor does say it's a certainty." Irving folded the letter and returned it to Brent, remarking, ic I do not understand this, surely there must be an error sornewhlere.'  Charley rose and walked away. ;            '      .

BEFORE a large mirror, which reached from ceiling to floor, Mary Lawrence stood, while her maid fastened the last white rose-bud amid the rich auburn curls. A perfect picture of loveliness was she as she stood there, array- ed, in that soft white silk muslin, threaded with silver, fitting so reecherche her exquisitely moulded figure; while the elegant point- lace berthe, with its sprigs d'argent, the late gift of the fond mother, graced so charmingly the full drooping shoulders, and fell in gauzy softness over the rounded arms, which were encircled by a pair of bracelets, carbuncles set with pearls. A sash of white, spotted with silver, to correspond with dress and, bertlhe, was fas- tened round the delicate waist by a simple neeud to the left. I A pair of white kid gloves, perfectly fitting the small plump hand, and a costly pearl fan, completed the toilet. A few half-blown rose-buds looked out from the rich luxuriance of the lustrous curls. The last bud was secured by the hand of the admiring waiting- maid, who stood motionless, gazing on the angelic vision before her. Mary took a survey of herself. The blood rushed to the roots of the soft, dark hair. She threw -herself on the sofa, and buried her face in her hands. "Oh, indeed, Miss Mary, you'll mash your dress and all, all to pieces," ejaculated the maid, with a look of horror. Do get up, and let me straighten it for you." The young girl heeded not the request, but sat still as death, h(r head bowed in her hands. The door-bell rang. Mary sprang to her feet. "Go, Maria, see who it is," she saidi nervously, to the girl, who stood gazing upon her with astonishment. "It is Captain Mort n, I'm sure, Miss Mary. See, it is nine olclack. You know he Iws to be for you at that hour." "Go, Maria," and she waved the servant to the door, who, with . a feeling of curious wonder at her young 1mistress's strange man-     152        RAIDS AND ROMANCE               L- ner, descended the hall stairway, and, opening the front door, ush-  ered the Federal officer into the pallor.! With rabid step Mary paced the floor for a few moments, her agitation constantly increasing. Then, leaning her elbow on the  dressing-stand, she toyed with the exquisite bouquet which stood 1 in the vase before her, and which Captain Morton had sent with li; compliments but a few hours before. Maria returned, and announced Captain Morton.  Murmuring some indistinct words to herself, while the color  deepened in her cheek, Mary seized the fan from the stand, cast a  hasty glance into the mirror, and beckoninq to Maria, who stood  holding her nubia, to follow her, with trembling she sought her  mother's room.  Bending over the couch of the pale invalid; she printed an affec- tionate kiss on the wan cheeki "You look worried to-night, my daughter. What is the matter  with you?" asked the anxious parent, in a soft, tender tone.  "Your face is flushed and feverish."- "Oh, nothing, mother," replied the young girl. "Only excite-  ment." And stooping over the low couch, she kissed'her mother  a second time, and passed to the parlor. "God shield my child!" murnur ed the mother, earnestly, as  the form of her only, her darling daughter disappeared through  the door. Then clasping her hands, the mother offered up for her -- child's safety such a prayer as only the heart of a mother could  give utterance to. i EI With a sweet, affabtle smile, Mary bade the young captain good- l evening, which was returned by him with a most gracious air. He was charmed to see her looking so beautiful, and he stood   -. gazing upon her with an expression of fond delight.        A He observed she did not wear the flowers he had sent her. For  a minute he felt chagrined, but in a moment the thought occurred  to him, she regards them too highly to waste them on this evening. She keeps them in her roonm, that she may enjoy them. His rising fears were subdued, his self-conceit highly flattered.      I "You are appearing most charmingly to-night, Miss Mary. Your color is unusually beautiful. Nature's own cosmetic. I I amn sure that you will be the cynosure of all eyes, and I the envied of all. the beaux.

I had scarcely supposed this would be so. But then, Mr. and Mrs. H. love popularity. They would sacrifice a great deal to secure it. And they have succeeded well. Their names are on the lips of both parties. Everybody speaks approvingly of them, as generous, affable, polite. And yet, I doubt-" The young girl paused, and taking the nubia from the servant, threw it around her shoulders. "Doubt what, Miss Mary?" "I will not finish the sentence. I fear 'I might, perchance, do some one injustice."  C"'Shall we go?" and the gallant captain, with all the. air of one who hasra position and feels it, offered his arm to escort the trem- bling girl to the carriage, which stood at the [door awaiting them. It was a splendid scene. The gorgeously fuirnished rooms were brilliantly lighted, and thronged with the beauty and elegance of the city. Bright eyes flashed, and diamonds gleamed, and smile answered smile, and greeting and congratulations were every- where given and returned throughout that gay multitude, where each heart seemed to have forgotten forever all sorrow, where each face was radiant with smiles, and every tongue was voluble with utterances of joy and gladness. Near the door of the conservatory, where rich, rare flowers breathed out fragrant perfumes, and where a hundred lights threw a flood of dazzling splendor over these mute but eloquent rprae-v sentatives of every clime, stood Mary Lawrence,. leaning on the armn of young Morton. He was speaking in a-low but earnest tone, and his attitude and manner. betrayed the depth of his feel- ing. With half-averted face, now flushed to crimson, and eyes bent to the ground, she listened to the ferventi words. Her bosom heaved with deep emotion, her hand trembled as it clasped tlhe fan which she vainly e'ndeavored to use to cool her burning cheeks. She felt that the eyes of all who passed were fastened upon her, and this served to increase her embarrassment. "What can be the matter with Mary Lawrence to-night?" asked Miss Whitmore of Lieutenant Dickinson, as the two stood in a position in the parlor that commanded a full view of the conser- vatory door. She appears so excited. I have never seen her half so gay as she seems this evening, nor yet half so beautiful. Is not she a perfect picture of loveliness, as she stands yonder beside that I7* l     154        RAIDS AND 1OMANCEI large orange-tree? She looks a fairy 'mid the flowers. Indeed, no idea that I have ever formed of the ancient goddesses could at all equal my realization of beauty in that form and face. I do not wonder Captain Morton worships her.

Busy-mouthed rumor says they are engaged to be married in September next. I know not whether the statement be true. I    i have heard it from various sources, and I opine no one who has observed his devotion to her to-night will for a moment doubt it. You regard the engagement as being a matter of certainty,  do you not, Miss Lu?" said the lieutenant, turning to address  Charley's sister, who, but a few minutes before, in comIpany with Miss Brent and two young gentlemen, had taken a position near Miss Whitmore and Lieutenant Dickinson, and who, interested in the officer's remarks, had turned to give him attention. "Mr. Shirley and I were but a few minutes ago discussing that question," she replied, assuming as much calmness as she could  command. ' He took the affirmative. I differed in opinion." "It is certainly so, Miss Lu!" exclaimed young Shirley. "Fred is one of my friends. I cannot be mistaken."  ' I'No one doubts it now," added Mr. Grayson. "The evidences are conclusive."  "It has been believed for weeks," interposed Mins Brent. "Three weeks since the rumor was so rife, I felt justifiable in writing the report to my brother who is with Colonel Morgan, and since then I havt had such frequent intimations of it that F have learned to regard it as a fixed fact." "He has scarcely left her side during the evening. I have ob- i served several gentlemen endeavor to win her from him. I my- self thought to do so; but after using all the strategy that I could master, I had at last to acknowledge myself foiled." "Ah, Grayson! we unstarred, buttonless wights stand but a  poor chance now in winning the hearts of the ladies fair. 'Our occupation's gone.; There is something about the stripes and tinsel that charms the girls. We shall have to don les habits militaire, or make up our minds to be Benedicts," said Shirley with an air of badinage, at the same time loolking with an ex- pression of mock grief upon the three ladies present. "' ome, come, Shirley, you do the ladies injustice," responded the lieutenant. ' I appeal to the three present to support me in a i        OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        1 denial of the charge. Say, ladies, i there an attraction about the trappings of war to win your hearts and fix your affections?" "By no means," responded Miss Whitmore; "if a man is a patriot, I care, not whether he wears the insignia of the battle-field or not," and she smiled very complacently on the officer by her side. "There is a wide difference in our views of patriotism, lieu- tenant," replied Miss Brent, spiritedly, yet with no manifestation of unkind feeling. "I deem it far more noble, far more patriotic to oppose the wrong than to perpetrate it: to fight for freedom and liberty than for subjugation." "Oh, we will not rgue this question now, Miss Brent. Our views are diverse, an   I suppos,irreconcilable, responded thile Federal officer, reddening over the position in which the young lady's remarks placed him. A smile of satisfaction gleamed on the face of Grayson and Shirley at the embarrassment of the lieutenant. They were at heart Southern, and were only awaiting an opportunity to get through the lines to join Colonel Morgan. "Will it not be the Union of the white and red roses when Miss Lawrence and young Morton marry?" remarked young Grayson to Miss Brent, as they withdrew to a position nearer the door which led ut to the conservatory. "You know she was always regarded as one of our most patriotic Southern ladies. Indeed, it is said that she had a lover who was taken at Donelson. It is no other than our old friend, Charley R., and that she went in disguise of a nun to Camp Chase to visit him." "And so she did, though it is not generally known. Lou. R., Charley's sister, acconmpanied her, and she will not believe that Mary and Fred Morton will ever be married. You see she will not be convinced. But certainly she is the only one that doubts. And she can no longer disbelieve after what she must have ob- served this evening." Supper'was announced, and the guests were ushered into the large and brilliantly lighted dining-room, where tables, laden with every dlicac that could please the eye or tempt the palate, were spread ut in luxurious bounty and elegance before the chaed ee; sparkling Wines, every variety of confection, in style a la Parisi- enne, ices, sherbets, voyaus, jellies, cakes of magnificent size and proportion, witI every variety of iced ornament that the imagina- tion could conceive, with fruits of all climes, were arranged with such artistic taste and. skill as to give an air of magic gri'andeun to this splendid collation.     156        RAIDS AND ROMANC  It so chanced that at the table Lou. R. found herself is-a-vis ij to Miss Lawrence and the young captain, while to her left stood Miss Brent with Mr. Spalding, an old friend of her brother Charley,  and no/w a devoted admirer of Miss R.   ,          I :: Mr. Spalding, a young man of twenty-seven, handsolne and in-  ti! telligent, was the son of a wealthy farmer near Lebanon, Kentucky. i t Having met Miss R. during the winter while on a visit to her : aunt, who resided in the vicinity of his father, he had formed a ji warm attachment for her, and during the spring and summer had   j becomi quite a frequent visitor at her father's.  Having been, from his earliest childhood, a great favorite with j the family of Mr. H., with whom he was distantly connected, he  ! was ever a guest in the house while visiting the city. As soon as ! he received his invitation to the party, he hastened to Louisville to secure the company of Lou. R., but found, on arriving, that Mr.  : Shirley, who was also an admirer of the young lady, had previ-'  : ously engaged it.                         : 'Opposed to Miss Brent and Mr. Spalding were Miss H., the    ; daughter of the generous host, and young Quimby, a cousin of   A Captain Morthn's, who had formerly been a lover of MTss Brent,  X but, owing to political differences, they had become estranged, and ? the young gentleman now vied with Lieutenant Dickinson in his    attentions to Miss Whitmore, one of the belles of the occasion.  i Conversation flowed freely between the friends across ttle table. Only young Quimby seemed averse to enjoy the dashes of witty   i and brilliant repartee which were giving zest to the charming viands. He was piqued at his proximity to Miss Brent, and as-  sumed an expression of contempt for what he chose to denominate i persiflage. Captain Morton appeared the very embodimetnt 6of happiness. He had a smile and bow for every one, and a satisfac- tory air which seemed to say I possess all my heart desires.   l Mary Lawrence was gay, unusually so, but' her friend Lou. PR. thought she discovered in her conduct .something which pro-   X nounced her buoyancy an effort. There was an expression of s bduedness in her manner and on her face which, to the sister's eager searching interest, appeared the index of that soft and tender emotion, the consciousness of loving and being loved. And as the thought of her friend's falsity to her brother ettled into a convic- tion in the sister's heart, she grew pale with the feeling of the deep wrong done that noble soul, of the agony and sorrow that must wring his heart with anguish unutterable., The remainder of the evening was passed by her in alternate   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         157 hope and fear. Every movement of Mary Lawrence received her searching scrutiny. But amid the whirl and elxcitement of the mnoing multitude she could form no just conclusion. Often, as she passed amid the throng, her ear was greeted with the fearful announcement of the certainty of the approaching marriage.  Once she thought to take Mary aside, and ask her if it could be true that she had deceived Charley.  But why ask her, she said to herself; if she is false, will she not deny it? I could not expect her to confess to me. Bewildered, chagrined, grieved, jealous of her brother's honor and happiness, and yet unwilling to inflict an injustice, even in !    thought, upon the friend of her childhood, Lou jR. left the gay as- semblage, at the close of the evening, with. feelings to which slhe had hitherto been a stranger--feelings that she could not analyze. "You are sad to-night, Miss Lu," said Mr. Spalding to her, as lie accompanied' her and Mr. Shirley to the house of a friend on ! Broadway. "A  perceptible change has passed over you in the last two hours, Miss Lu," interposed Mr. Shirley. "Did you lose your heart in the gay .throng; of cavaliers, to-night? I observed the admiring and very devoted manner of the gay Lothario from Lexington, Mr. Grigsby. Was he really successful in making an ineffaceable impression?" "Oh, by no means, Mr. Shirley,"' she replied, with that frankness so characteristic of her heart. "' He is a pleasant, agreeable gen- tlenman; but I shall have no remembrance of him beyond an evening acquaintance." i;  "I would not be bold or inquisitive, Miss Lu," said Spalding, in a serious tone, " but I will dare to ask, as a friend, why it is you have been so sad for the last few hours?" "Whiat, have I been sad? I fancied I was very glad and happy. You gentlemnen must be deceived. Hare I not been fuli of smiles anrd laughter?" E a Rather of thought and sadness. It could be read in your face; was echoed in your tone--spoke in every movement." "All a mistake, gentlemen. Allow me to say to you, you have greatly deceived yourselves." "happy to hear you so declare, Miss Lu," replied Spalding "Better that we should be deceived than you grieved."' "How very brilliant your friend Miss Lawrence was to-night!" he added, after a pause. "And so beautiful! I presume, there is no doubt but that she is engaged to youn MYIortori. His attentions ,^^     158       IRAIDS AND ROMANCEE to her tonight were vexingly devoted. I but bowed to her. I had desired to converse with her, for I wished to hear her describe her visit to Camp Chase. She is aufait in description. Captain Morton 1ill secure a lovely and charming prize when he claims her as his own." The yoi ng girl made no reply. ", He is a lucky fellow, indeed," interposed Shirley. "Miss Mary is one of he most beautiful girls of our city, and as good as she  is beautiftl." The party had reached the steps as Mr. Shirley concluded his remark. Waiting to see the young lady safely in, they bade her good-nigh , and left.     -  To describe the sister's emotions, as she lay thinking over the strange, inexplicable" question before her, would be impossible.. Her soul was stirred to its depths at the thought of the deep injury her brother had received, and her indignation against the author of the crime changed her love to hatred. "I will write to Charley!" she exclaimed, as she lay tossing on her pillow. "I will tell him he has been deceived-wronged- cursed-in bestowing his wealth of love on this unworthy girl."   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        159 CHAPTER XXIX. THE SURPRISE. IT had for some time been the intention of Colonel Morgan to advance into Kentucky, for the purpose of recruiting his forces, and of harassing and damaging the enemy, by cutting off transpor- tation, capturing his detached troops, and destroying his stores at such points as he should find imperfectly protected. The sad disaster at Lebanon, Tennessee, had delayed the accomplishment of his plan, but though postponed it had never been abandoned. His designs had been imparted to his staff, and their advice and co-operation solicited. They fully coincided in his views, deeming the undertaking one that, if properly conducted, would necessarily result in great benefit to the Confederate cause. His adjutant, Major Basil Duke, a man of cool judgment and undaunted courage, together with Colonel St. Leger Grenfel, an English officer, who had attached himself to Colonel Morgan, and who, from his experience and skill, was peculiarly fitted to accom- pany such an expedition, were his chief advisers. One ofNthe objects of the expedition-indeed, the main one- was the destruction of the Louisville and Nashville railroad, upon which the enemy in Tennessee, owing to the low stage of the Cumberland river, was almost wholly dependent for supplies. Could the road be effectually destroyed, it would necessarily greatly embarrass him for the present, and certainly retard his advance. After the return of the eighty prisoners, the first thing to be attended to was the arming and equipping of as many as it was possible to attend to under the circumstances. Most of them were veterans who could be relied on in any emergency. Many of them were natives of the State, perfectly familiar with its roads and streams, and consequently peculiarly fitted for an advance, and for reconnoitring. ' Colonel Morgan, after having matured his plan, and made such preparations aS he deemed necessary, determined to move into     160        RAIDS AND ROMANOE Kentucky. It was about the 4t1l of July when he set out on his undertaking. Leaving:his headquarters in the vicinity of Knoxville, he made a dash through Middle Tennessee, crossed the Cumberland river near Hartsville, and entered the State south of Scottsville, to which point he proceeded with the main body of his force, numbering about one thousand men. Meanwhile, he sent Colonel Stearnes, with a detachment of about two hundred and fifty men, to capture Tompkinsville, and destroy what stores might be found there. There were stationed at this town four companies of a Pennsylvania cavalry regiment. Not supposing that the enemy was within hundreds of miles, the Yan- kees were completely surprised, and after a short and bloodless contest, were fully routed, with the loss of forty prisoners and as many horses and guns. It was an entire defeat to the Federals, and so rapid were the movements of the Confederates, that before the routed foe could recover from their consternation and rally reinforcements for an attack, the enemy had fled, they knew not whither. Colonel Morgan, at the head of his command, then dashed into Glasgow, where, after capturing the place and its provost-guard, and releasing some Southern men whom lhe found imprisoned foi their opinions, he issued a proclamation explaining his object in invading the State, and called on all true Kentuckians, who re- garded freedom as a birthright,' and were unwilling to bow the knee before usurpation and tyranny, to join his standard and assist in redeeming their beloved State from the vile thraldom under which she now groaned. A little incident occurred here worthy of notice, since it illus- trates the difference between the animus of Southern men and so- styled Union men. There was in Glasgow a Judge McFerrin, a prominent member of the Baptist Church, now au old man; his head was whitenedI by age, his litheness and buoyancy were long since gone. When the question of North and South was introduced into Kentucky, he took a very decided stand in favor of what he called." the Gov- ernment." Some of his friends, more far-sighted than himself, endeavored to convince him of his error in supposing an abo- lition administration ever was or ever could be the constitutional government of the United States. But the old- man, never dis- tinguished for quick perception and correct conclusions, with his faculties blinded by years, could not be made to discriminate be-.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        161 tween the two. And with a zeal all untempered by judgment, he espoused the "union cause" and became the bitter opponent of all who dared to entertain' a contrary opinion. With that intoler- ance characteristic of narrow minds governed by prejudice and passion rather than right reason, he denounced all who opposed his mistaken views as destitute of all religion, and wholly debarred forever from entering the kingdom of heaven. Thus, with Jesu- itical zeal, he became the persecutor of his brethren. For months he had been active in finding out who, in his vicinity were "vile secesh," as he contemptuously branded them, .and when- ever a fitting opportunity offered, he would " bring thein to jus- tice," as he denominated searching out innocent neighbors, and having them imprisoned. His zeal equalled that of Paul, when breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord. He persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into prison both men \ women. And all this was done to support the "best government in the world," it was alleged, as if the precepts of the Divine Teacher were no longer binding on the consciences of those who had es- poused the cause of the civil magistrate. Colonel Morgan's men had been informed of the course pur- sued by the old judge. Partly by way of retaliation, and partly for amusing variety, they determined on his arrest. It was high noon. The old judge, sitting in his office, in all the assumption of judicial dignity, was conversing with two or three friends, like-minded with himself, on the "wicked rebellion," e and the doom that ought to be meted out to every traitor in the land, be he young or old, distinguished or obscure. His wrath waxed hot as he dwelt on the " high crime of trying to overthrow the best government, in the act of endeavoring to break up the glorious Union for which our forefathers bled ;" and as he warmed with his subject, his. righteous indignation would vent itself in sundry hard thumps on the red cherry table at his side, which served with him to give emphasis to his loud and bitter words. While the old judge was thus in the very height of his abusive tirade, a young man, breathless with excitement, rush- ed to the door of the office, and calling out, "Morgan's men! Mor- gan's men in town!" disappeared down the street. Suddenly the scene changed. The question was now, not how he should defend his country against the vile secesh invader, but how he could save 'his own important person.          iT     1 162       RADS AND  ROMANCE  A fearful silence quickly succeeded the loud rant of the moment before, and the crimson of fierce passion died out in th e wrinkled face of the old man, over which the deadly pallor of fear now spread itself. Thisl violent denouncer of "traitors and rebels," like Felix, was seized with sudden trembling in view of his high misdemeanor. His ardent patriotism vaporized in a moment at the mere mention of the enemy's presence. Not waiting for any further assurance of danger, he cast one wild, blank look on his horror-stricken companions, and seizing his hat with the despera- tion of a man who seeks to free himself from impending destruc- tion, he rushed through the back door of his office, and with rapid strides sought his home. Reaching the house, he dashed frantically in, and exclaimed with gasping breath, L"Morgan, Morgan, Mor- gan!" and without pausing to answer any of the many inquiries proposed by his affrighted family, he dashed out of the door through which he Ihal entered, hastened down the street as if pursued by the vengefl Furies, never pausing a moment to look to the right or left until he reached the outskirts of the little town. He was making his way with all possible celerity to a field of corn which stood to the left of the main road, hoping to secrete himself therein until he could pass unobserved to the house of a friend two miles distant in the country. But, alas for his vision of escape, just as he gained the fence a voice cried out- "There he goes, boys i see him, see him; catch him 1" "Where, where?" cried, out a dozen voices at once. Like a death-knell the words fell on the ear of the old man, now vainly essaying to climb the fence. He was perched target-like on the tlopmost rail, his hair streaming out on the breeze (he had lost his hat in his desperate plunge at the fence), his face pale with affright, while he shook from head to foot with trepidation and alarm. 4Where, where?" the boys repeated. "Yonder on that fence, behind that large tree. Don't you see him 2" and young Leslie, who knew the old man well, dashed on towards the spot, followed by his comrades, shouting like mad- men.    J "Our prisoner, judge,?" said he, as he sprang forward towards the old man. "Turn about is fair play, you know. You have been persecuting our friends; we must now avenge their wrongs. Come with us, if you please." The old man was assisted from his perch, placed between two of the boys and marched back to town, I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         163 his guard in the mean time preserving the greatest gravity, while the boys behind were convulsed with laughter. "And the day of retribution has at last come, and woetto the  offenders I tell you, boys. They must now endure something more than the lashings of conscience!" responded Morgan in a solenmn voice, at the same time looking most mischievously at Charley.        '  'Ah! most fearful indeed must be their doom. Ours is the Draconian code-death by the law for every crime," addedf Charley aimpressively, catching in a moment young Morgan's meaning. Leslie and Irving, scarcely able to contain themselves, glanced round with an approving smile upon their companions, while the boys behind the'n laughed outright at the farce The boys knew that Colonel Morgan would release the old judge after scaring him a while, and they were' determined to punish him a little on their own score. So Charley and young Morgan, assisted by several others who crowded round the trembling culprit, continued their ominous remarks, preserving all the while a most serious tone. The old judge looked nervously first on one side and then on the other. He would have defended himself, but he could not think what to say. He knew he was guilty of all the charges the boys so adroitly brought against "offenders," and he was left without one plea to argue in his own behalf. He was thinking, as well as the confused state of his mind would allow, of throwing himself on the clemency of Colonel Morgan, who he had often heard was full of magnanimity, when Charley remarked to the boys in a loud, distinct tone-    [ "' Our colonel is always ready to forgive a persdnal wrong, boys, you know; but whel his friends have suffered at the hands of Union men, he never fails to redress their grievances in the most, summary mtanner. The oldlman's heart sunk within him. His last hope was gone. His knees trembled violently-the deadly pallor of his face i:- creased- he stared wildly upon his tormentors. Soon e would be in the presence of his inexorable judge, to await his fearful sentence. "What would that sentence be?" his fearful heart asked. What could it be but the severest punishment!  - ; Oh, that I had but pursued a different course!" he said to hinm- self. "My country did not require all this at mny hands. Oh that I had minded my own business and left these matters alone!" "There are Southern men in jail in this town now, I Ileal,' re-       164       : RAIDS AND ROMANCE plied Morgan, "'placed here through the efforts of Union men. They must be avenged." "' Some of our friends and relatives are in prison, Jones," said Leslie to one of the young men near him. ' WE must sele that they are released, and their persecutors sent down to Dixie to try the charlns of imprisonment there." These two young men were from the vicinity of Glasgow. Their relatives were all Southern in sentiment, and with others had shared the injustice of the mob. "They will be fully avenged now, Leslie. Those who have placed them there. will have to suffer for it. Colonel Morgan will ferret out the whole matter, and whlen he finds the guilty one, I tell you, woe be to him." 4"It were better that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the depths of the Mississippi.," "And it is but just that they should suffer," responded Charley, preserving his solemn air and impressive tone. "Nothing but just. It is a crying sin, that should meet with the severest penalty, this thing of taking up a man and putting him in prison merely because he can't think as another man does. We don't imprison men for their opinions, and woe to the Union man when he falls into our hands who has been the cause of hunting out his Southern neighbors and putting them in jail." Thus regaling the ears of their conscience-stricken prisoner, the boys bore him along to the presence of Colonel Morgan. Leslie introduced the judge. "Judge McFerrin," observed the colonel, eyeing closely the trembling old man: "I think I have heard of you, judge. Not very friendly to us 'vile secesh,' I believe-have had something to do with arresting those gentlemen there whomn I have just re- leased," said he, pointing to the five citizens of the place who had but a few minutes before stepped forth- from the county jail. The old man could not reply. He stood as if spell-bound, look- ing upon his accuser.         I "Take care of the judge, boys. I will attend to his case an- other time," and Colonel Morgan having very politely waved to the boys to remove the prisoner, it was done with all possible solemnity. The old man, trembling from head to foot, was conducted to his office, the door locked, and a guard stationed round the house. The boys, who had entered into the scene with great zeal, and   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        165 who had derived no little merriment from the ludicrous fright of the old judge,. determined not to release him until he was sworn to good behavior for the future. So after keeping him in prison for full three hours, dinnerless and quaking with alarln, they brought him forth and duly administered the oath of 'allegiance to the Southern Confederacy, to which the old judge, happy for any means of escape, subscribed, albeit his self-pride brought certain contortions to his face, which the boys, divining the cause, enjoyed most fully.    l "Go, sin no more. We'll be round about here soon again, and hope to have a good report from you," said Irving, taking upon hinself the dignity of a magistrate. The old judge turned, and hastened away from this improvised court of justice a wiser if not a better'man., In a few short hours fear had so far bvercome his patriotism that he has never since manifested any lingering of his Jesuitical propensity. That evening Colonel Morgan, with his command, set out on a rapid march to central Kentucky. "I wonder," said Charley to young Lawrence, as the two rode on in the soft moonlight, "if we shall really reach Louis- ville?" The interrogatory was propounded in a tone so full of meian- choly that Lawrence looked up in surprise, and fixed his eyes full upon the face of his friend, which was plainly visible in the moon- ligtlt, its sadness deepened by the pale, soft light. "Indeed, I cannot tell, Charley, but suppose we will if it its practicable. But one would think from your look that you would prefer death to a return to your old home. What is the matter - with you, anyhow? You have looked as if, Atlas-like, you had the whole world on your shoulders. I have noticed it ever silice this expedition was projected. Surely you are not seriously opposed to a visit to our dear old city, if it does wear the gyves of the ' Old Baboon.'" "No, no, John; of course I do not object to returning to Louis- ville." The -lips uttered the words-the conscience questioned their truth. "If she is false," he exclaimed to himself, "why should I de- sire to return? Death--the cold, lone grave-eternity with all its dread uncertainties-any thing-any thing rather than see her- she, the light of my life, another's!"     166        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "Charley, you puzzle me, old fellow. You act like one in a strange, wild dream. I have noticed it for several days. Whllat on earth can be the matter with you? When we are all so delighted with the thought of being once more on old Kentucky soil, so wild with the hope of getting back to Louisville, to greet our friends and punish our foes, to find you sad and gloomy, I is anomalous. I can't tell how to interpret it. You must have something on your mind, that you haven't told me oft Out with it. If it is a secret, I will keep it for you most masonically-that you iknow. If you have sins to atone for, let me be your father con- fessor. It will do you good to unbosom yourself. Come, let's have it." The words of avowal struggled up to our young hero's lips. He was about to disclose his consuming grief. He paused a moment, choked down the words with a mighty effort, and replied, with as much nonchalance as his feelings would ad- mit- "You must be mistaken, John. I am sure I act very naturally. I am not well, to be sure, and this no doubt affects me. Perhaps I do seem dull-I certainly feel so."  "I am glad to hear that, my old boy. This trip will cure any indisposition you may have, I'll wager. Won't it be too fine, if we can pounbe down on old Prentice, Jerry Boyle, and a few others of the same calibre, and whip them off to Dixie? But the cowards, they'll run. I'll venture old Prentice is already sleep- ing of nights in Jeffersonville or New Albany. We'll never get him, I'n afraid; he will always manage to keep out of harm's way." Charley made no answer to his friend's remarks, but rode along silent and thoughtful. After several fruitless lefforts to engage him in conversation, Lawrence desisted, and gave himself to humming snatches of Southern airs, and indulging in bright dreams-many of which, like the dreamings of us all, were never to be realized. About ten o'clock the column reached Barren river, where they halted for the night. Pickets were thrown out-scouts sent forward-every precaution was taken to avoid surprise by the foe. The remembrance of Lebanon, Tennessee, was yet fresh in their memories.      r Charley was required to do picket duty. The lonely hours of the night rolled wearily on, as sullenly he brooded over his great grief. How mockingly every sound fell on his ear I how mock-   OF MOGAN EAND HS MEN.         167 ingly every sight met his eye! The moonbeams, quivering in silver sheen on the bosom of the quiet-moving river; the nodding star of heaven; the deep, dark forest; the breeze that through its silence crept; the low monotone of the cricket; the baying of thd watch-dog;-all seemed to whisper to his soul tales-of disap- pointment and woe. "Scenes that are brightest awhile may beguile Hearts that are lightest, and eyes that smile; And o'er them, above us, Nature may beam-- But with none to love us, how dark they seem!" I     168        RAIDS AND ROMANOE I      / CHAPTER XXX.  "EBANON, KENTUCKY. IT Was Friday morning, Jul 11lth, when Colonel Morgan, with aboutiseven hundred men, set out for Lebanon, distant thirty-five miles from Barren river. The day was hot and dry; the burning summer's sun looked down from the cloudless heavens above upon the parched earth, which reflected back his scorching beamns into the heated air, until the breath of the Simoom seemed to sweep over the land. But the men, neither unnerved by scorching sun or winter's icy breath, rode cheerily on. And one, to have seen them with their coats off, carelessly hanging from the arm or thrown across the horse before them, while they jauntily sped along, and listened to their gay conversation and merry laughter, would have thought it a jocund hunting-party, rather than a band of soldiers, far away from friendly assistance, in the heart of an enemy's coun- try. Honor, all honors to those brave men and their gallant chieftain, who thus boldly penetrated the lines of the foe, and carried terror and destruction throughout his borders I Twntyfnine miles of the rough, weary road had been passed. Eleven o'clock at night found this handful of brave men at the New Market bridge, on Rolling Fork, six miles fromn Lebanon. Up to this point they had encountered no difficulty. The enemy had wisely withdrawn from their path.  And here they were, hundreds of miles from any force that could give them relief-in a hostile country, surrounded on all sides by a vengeful foe-everywhere beset by those whose chief joy it would be to betray -them into the hands of that foe-they braved danger in every form, encountered hardship in every phase, that t ey might serve the cause of right and human liberty. Lebanon, the county seat of Marion, is a well-located town, with; population of several hundreds. It is the terminus of a branch of the Louisville and Nashville railroad, and the thorough- fare for all the travel and produce from the large extent of coun- try surrounding it, which finds outlet at Louisville. It was re- garded as a point of great importance by the Federal government, l   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        169 and was one of the first places in Kentucky permanently occupied by their troops. At the time of which we write, they had con- centrated at this point a large amount of stores of every descrip- tion. A commodious hospital had been erected near the town, and the large wagon-yards were filled with wagons, ambulances, and all vehicle Iaraphernalia. It was a tempting prize to the Confederates, and their brave leader decided to secure it. Two companies of the Twenty-eighth Kentucky, under the Fed- eral officer, Lieutenant-colonel A. T. iJohnston, held the place. So rapid had been the movements of Colonel Morgan since he entered the State, that but little respecting them could be ascertained with certainty. i i  o -. The excitement and indignation consequent on the occupation of this town by the Federal troops, had subsided. All was now peace and quiet-the villagers had grown accustomed to thE "blue-coated gentry," andithose who detested them and the prin- ciples,they represented, had learned to regard them with con- tenlptuous silence. Suddenly, on the 11th of July, the town was thrown into a state of the wildest confusion and alarm. Rumors spread through the streets that John Morgan' and his men, having driven before them all the Federal forces in the southern part of the State, routing and slaying them at every point, were now marching rapidly on Lebanon. Every tongue caught up the fearful intelli- gence-from house to house the news was borne-each repetition giving a widely exaggerated margin, until the story was indeed one of fearful import. Shortly, a dispatch came-this was authentic -and never did questioner of oracular divinity wait with more eager fear the decisive response, than did the terrified crowd the unfolding of the lightning's message. Alas i it was but little cal- culated to still their consternation. About noon, the following dispatch was received- "John Morgan is twenty miles southwest of Lebanon, near the little village of ' Pinch 'Em Slyly,' and will take Lebanon to- night," This confirmation'of their fears sped on the wings Of the wind, and like the morning rumors was soon added to, and so highly colored, that the six hours' future became the fearful now. Every moment Morgan was expected to rush through the streets. What was to follow his debut, no one knew-each one imagined as suited his preconceived opinions and desires. 8     170        RAIDS AND ROM4NCE The military partook deeply of the fright. Runners were dis- patched here, there, everywhere, to warn the Home Guards to hold themselves in readiness for a most fearful attack. One corn- patny of the Twenty-eighth Kentucky was placed in position for offensive operations, under command of Captain Barth. Dis- patcles were sent to Louisville and other points for feinforce- ments Ito be forwarded immediately; the town was but feebly defended, and unless assistance was received, it must certainly surrender. Evening came, but brought no reinforcements. The coin- inander, Lieutenant-colonel Johnston,' was in a sad dilemma. Every moment the dreaded foe was expected to bear down upon his fee- ble band with an overwhelming force of veterans. In the con- sternation, the bridge across the Rolling Fork was forgotten. It was a point of some importance, and might be defended. Some one mentioned its strength to the terrified commander. Immedi- ately a squadron of men, composed of volunteers and Home Guard, under young Lieutenant Vatlin, was sent out-to guard the bridge. Pickets were stationedaon all the roads leading into the town, for no one seemed to have the least idea from what direction Morgan would approach. Men, women, and children thronged the streets, hurrying to and fro with no definite object in view, except to hear the news. Stores, groceries, shops, all were closed-their alarmed proprietors swaying to and fro with the moving crowd. It is doubtful whether a drachm of medicine could have been secured for a dying man. Hour. after hour of fearful suspense rolled by, and yet no enemy came. Half-past eleven o'clock at night a man dashed into the town, saying Morgan was at the bridge, only six miles out. The guard had? fired upon him, and he was in full retreat. This calmed the fears of the over-credulous, and some of the weary watchers ventured to retire. But the Federal commander had too high an appreciation of Colonel Morgan's courage to suppose that the force at the bridge could thus easily put him to flight. So he ordered two men to accompany Lieutenant Fiddler to the bridge, and ascertain the true state of affairs and report immediately. This Lieutenant Fiddler, a pettifogging lawyer, who used to "fiddle" on every possible occasion in all matters, whether of church or State, finding his profession wholly unremunerative, "had en- listed," to use his own words, "under his country's glorious ban-   dF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        171 ner, to serve his country's glorious cause." He was of medium \ height, slim, red-haired, and self-important. He had volunteered his services on this momentous occasion as aid to Colonel Johnston. Mounted upon his charger, with a splendid navy pistol at his side, he dashed off amid the darkness, accompanied by his body- guard of two, to see how matters stood at the bridge. Inflated with a sense of his own importance, he spurred on at break-neck speed towards the accomplishment of his momentous mission. He, with his two aids close beside him, was ascending  hill a few hundred yards from New Market, when thelthree were very unexpectedly ordered to halt by the advance guard of Morgan's brigade. The fiddling lieutenant debated not a moment. \Wheel- ing his horse about, he started out under whip and spur for Leba- non, followed by his panting attendants. Shots came whizzing around their ears. The clatter of the pursuing horsemen grew every moment nearer. He strained his failing steed to the utmost. Already he was distanced by his body-guard, and solus he was urging on his fearful gallop, when two of the dreaded foe dashed by him and cut off flurlher retreat. Appropriating horse, equip- ments, and revolver, they gave him parole and left him to his fate. Two miles from this the Confederates encountered the pickets, which were readily driven back upon the nmain body. Morgan sent forward scouts to ascertain the enemy's position and num- bers. They reported a smIall force drawn up in line of battle two miles ahead. Advancing, he dismounted and deployed two com- panies to attack the enemy on the left and right. Rapidly, yet silently,the men marched on. They were not dis-  covered until they were within a few hundred yards of Johnston's command, when they were fired upon by the Federals. They rushed forward and returned the fire with a well-directed volley, and at the same time the mounted men dashed up in front. A general panic seized the enemy, and casting aside guns and every thing that could impede their race, they set out, pell-mell, in full retreat along the road, over fences, through fields and wood- lands, each one striving with strained nerve to make the best time back to the town. Two of their men lay dead upon the field, others were wounded so severely that they had to be left. The Confederates pressed on after the fleeing enemy. In a few min- utes Colonel Johnston and sixty-five out of his force of eighty men were prisoners. Only thirteen escaped. Colonel Morgan, at the head of his brigaderentered the town without further opposition. He was welcomed by many with evi-     172        RAIDS AND ROMANCE dernt manifestations of joy. Taking iimrnediate possession of the telegraph office, he learned that the 60th Indiana, under Dolbnel Owens, had been dispatched from the Junction to reinforce John- stoln.  An order was given to Major Gano, of the Texas Rangers, to proceed with a coinmpany and destroy the railroad bridge on the Lebano/n branch, thus preventing the troops from reaching the! town. This was successfully accomplished by this youlg! and darling officer. i They were now fully secured from a11 attacks, and the few re- maining hours of the night were 4pent in rest. Early next morning Morgan threw out pickets on every roadd, and then proceeded to the work of inspecting the depots, with their stores of sugar, coffee, flonra, bread, guns, caps, cartridges, powder, boots, shoes, hats, etc. Not wishing wilfully to sacrifice these immense commissallyf stores, lie made known to the people his in- tention to divide, adnong those that needed, such portions of tihe captured articles as they niglht desire. Great was the rush to the depots from every quarter. Men, woinen, and children, with wheel- barrows, baskets, buckets, and every available mneans of transpor- tation, crowded the depot to receive a share of the general spoil. Sugar, coffee, and flour were distributed with a generous hand by the soldiers appointed for the phrpose. "Come, boys," said Colonel St. Ledger Grenfel, who was charged with the burning of the depots; ' come, we must do our work, the day passes. Get your torches. We are going to have a grand bonfire, of which Uncle Sam will pay the expenses. We have fed the hungry and administered to the wants of the needy, and now we must commit this surplus to the flames. But first, boys, take for yourselves all you desire. You are entitled to it by right of capture. Come, boyS, to work." T The order was scarcely given, before the boys, eager for the un- dertaking, ruslied in and fired the building at a dozen points. "Now, Captain Roberts, you proceed with your men to the ordnance department, and do likewise."      i With alacrity the command followed their leader, and, aftqf having secured such arms as the colonel had designated, for tlhe arming of new recruits, the men dashed into the depot, gathered up arnfuls of guns, and proceeding with them to the nearest avail- able point, Wvjould batter them over rocks until they were bent double; others would pound them with heavy stones, thus render- ing the locks entirely useless. It was a scene of the greatest activ-   OF MORGAN AND HS    IrEN.    , 173 ity. The boys would cheer each other with song and jest, and kind- ly word, while the citizens who grouped round them, joined in the merriment and laughter, i'rrespective of old prejudices. Cartridge- boxes, kegs of powder, cases of caps and guns, were indiscrimi- nately thrown into a stream that rlun outside of the town, which precluded forever their recovery by the Yankees. It was laughable to see the many and ready transformations ef- fe cted by thd boy, who, amid the roaring of laughter, stepped forth metamorphosed into Lincoln soldiers. Every man who de- sired, plovided limself with a fall Yankee outfit-pants, coat, hat,  boots, and gun. All instructions having been obeyed, the order rang out, "Now fire the buildings, boys." In an instant, twenty men rushed in and applied the burning brand. A few moments more, and the flames, crackling and /hissing, leaped from point to point, until the two large houses were wrap- ped in a glaring sheet of fire. As the boys stood gazing on the fearful and sublime scene, they sent up shout after shout of tri- umph, their pealing voices rising high above the crashing noise of falling timbers and the iishing tongues of fiery flame. OColonel Morgan had reserved for himself the superintendence of tile destruction of the large hospital with its stores. Taking with him a detachment of picked men, among whom. were Charley, Brent, Curd, Irving, and Hawkins, he proceeded to have removed to places of safety and comfort, the few Federal sick that there were contained in it. Gently, as a brother, he provided for their wants. He remembered that, though foes, thley, were helpless; though seeking to destroy his life, they were suffering human be- ings. When the last nman was beyond danger, the hospital was fired. Simultaneously with this, the torch was applied to the wagons and ambulances, and the flames from these two points, combined with those from the burning depots, gave to the scene an aspect of wild P] terrible sublimity. Colonel Morgan remain- ed long enough to see that his purposes were fully executed. Then, mounting his horse, he dashed out of the devoted town, followed I by his jubilant command, and, lighted by the wild, red flames, pursued his way to Springfield. Chlarley obtained permission to pass the night with his aunt, Mrs. Payne, who resided a few miles from Lebanon. There he met with young Spalding, wl o had just returned from Louisville. The two being old, tried friends, having been educated together at Bardston, were delighted to meet again. Spalding, in the ingen-         I/     174        RAIDS AND ROMANCE uousness of his soul, recited to dhairley all the intelligence he possessed, giving a lengthy and most minute description of the elegant party at Mr. H.'s. Most of Charley's friends had leen present on that occasion, and the gay young man deemed he could select no topic of equal interest. When he dwelt on the increasing devotion of Captain Morton to Mary Lawrence, and the certainty of their speedy marriage, Charley's heart ceased its beatings, his soul was pierced as with barbed arrows. "And so you think they will be married, Ben?" he asked, with a mighty effort to control himself, while he felt as one who asked for his own death-sentence. '"No doubt of it, Charley. The city is full of the rumor; in- deed, it creates a great deal of gossip, as Miss Mary has hitherto been considered unalterably opposed to every thing Federal, even so stringent in her views, as to seek the middle of the street, rather than walk under the old flag. And then she has a brother John, her only brother-by the by, is he here with you?-in the Confed- erate service. Her friends are astonished at her ourse, and some blame her in unsparing terms. But Morton is rich, you know, and a very fascinating fellow in his manner; but, in my judgment, by no means worthy of Miss Lawrence. You know his habits are very Goose, and no one gives him credit for patriotism in donning the Yankee uniform. He only desired to be important, the world says." Charley made no reply to the rernsks of his friend. He dare not trust himself with words. The fast ray of hope was gone. Shipwrecked on life's sea, he was lost, for6ver lost. The future, rayless darkness; the present, a Promethean fire; the past, a tan- talizing dream. Deceived, betrayed, wrecked by the beautiful idol of his soul, whom his pure, trusting heart had worshipped with more than earthly devotion, henceforth, the world to him must prove a cold, barren waste, life a weary weight, which must be borne as the prisoner does his galling, clanking chains. In torturing thought the night was spent. The following morn- ing found him in the saddle, ready to start forward to join the command. He waited not to bid adieu to his friends. He felt all earthly ties snapped forever. Henceforth, he would court death.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         175 CHAPTER XXXI. ONWARD MOVEMENTS. CAPTAIN Jack Allin had been dispatched from Barren river with three companies, to destroy the bridge over Salt river at Shepardsville. But, before reaching his destination, he was en- countered by a force that had been sent from the Lebanon Junc- tion to reinforce Johnston at Lebanon. After a sharp engagement, he was repulsed with the loss of one man killed. He' then pro- ceeded to Springfield, where he rejoined Colonel Morgan, who had moved to this point after the capture of Lebanon. From here Captain Allen advanced with a squad of men to Taylorsville, from whence he sent forward a small force under Captain Champ Fer- guson in the direction of Shelbyville, in order to menace Frank- fort, thereby preventing reinforcements being sent from this place to Lexington or Paris. At Shelbyville, when it became known that Morgan's men were in the vicinity, the wildest confusion prevailed. Here, as at Le- banon, the most conflicting rumors ran riot through the streets. 'Morgan is assuredly marching on Shelbyville," cried out one. "It is so, for a reliable gentleman has just seen his men only a few miles from the town." "He is coining from Taylorsville on the Mount Eden road, and no mistake," asserted another. A few minutes more, and a man, breathless with excitement, dashed into the town, declaring "he himself had seen Morgan's men, and their horses' heads were set towards Shelbyville, and they would be there in a few minutes-half an hour at the outside."' This time he was approaching from the direction of Louisville. "He is on his way to Frankfort, and must necessarily pass througlh here," argued another. And thus it was settled, Shelby- ville, par necessit, must receive a visit from the dreaded chieftain. The funds were hastily extracted from the bank vault, and dispatched under strong escort to Louisville. The Homte Guard were called upon to defend the place. In the' most hurry-skurry manner that could be conceived, they hastened to arm themselves, '  '           .     176        RAIDS AND ROMANCE and after much more noise and confusion than a skilful general would have made in preparing an army for battle, they finally succeeded in formnng themselves into something like an orderly line, and stood prepared to meet the impending crisis. Alen flocked to the town to hear the news, each one receiving a different statement :from every informant he met. The day, wore on--every hour the excitement grew more and inore intense. And by the early evening it was asserted. as a fact, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Morgan, with hundreds of nien, was within a few miles of the place, and would be upon it directly. At this intelligence the Home Guard suddenly broke ranks, and fled in ievery possible direction, never for a moment slackening their pace until they were assured that danger no longer beset them. Henry F. Middleton, a most rabid Lincolnite, editor of the town sheet called the Weekly News-every issue of!which dealt out  , ' the most unsparing abhse of the -.orth, and of all that pertained thereto-hastily gathered up ihis family and valuables, and, with- out waiting to procure a more suitable conveyance, jumped into a furniture car, with some free darkies, drove off at lightning speed, and never halted until he was fifteen miles from the enemy. A council was called to see what was best to be done under this most alarming exigency. The defenders of the town had fled- the editor was off with his valuables, many of the prominent Union men of all ages were gone, no one knew whither-every- body was panic-striken. What could be done but surrender tile place to this formidable chieftain? After mluch debate, it wgs decided that this should be done, and two of the council were proposed las fit personages to set out under a flag of truce, to meet the dreaded hero, and tender him possession of the place. And now the question arose, "who should go?" Here was a dilemmua. Union men were afraid to venture. Southern ]nen said it was a matter of:no moment to them whether the town was given up or not. They did not fear John iMYorgan and his men, and if he chose to take the place, they were content. Finally, after much ado, a Southern man, who had enjoyed the sport to his greatest satisfaction, and who felt his heart moved with compassion for the helpless womlen and children so nearly dead with fright, consented to be one of the flag-bearers. But now a new difficulty arose. The few loyal men left did not know how to get up a flag for the occasion. "'Tlley wanted no mistake about it-Morgan was a terrible man, mighty particular, and must have things done upon the square." I   OF MORGAN  AND HS MEN.       1" The ladies were importuned to assist in finding a suitable emblem of submission, and finally succeeded in procuring one that satis- fied the most faint-hearted Union coward.   * Out 'rent the truce-bearers, followed by the prayers and tears of the anxious multitude. On they rode, bearing high aloft their imlnaculate ensign. Pursuing the route of the reported approachl, they passed on, mile after mile; but no enemny appeared. Strange, wild stories imet them at every step. - But nothing could be credited. Feel- ing, at last, thiat they had pursued the fleeing phantom far enough, they wheeled their horses, and galloped back to town to relieve the fears of the friends who awaited their return in torturing suspense. Meanwhile, Colonel Morgan was quietly pursuing his way through Springfield to Macksville, where he arrived late in the evening. Here he rested for a while, and here was attacked by tile Hone Guard, who, after the exchange of a few shots; were routed-not, however, until they had severely wounded one of his men, and taken two others prisoners. Morgan, finding two of his boys captives in the hands of the en- emy, determined not to leave the place until they were recovered. Seizing upon two of the most prominent Union men in the little town, he made it known that they should not be released until his men were restored. This had the expected effect, and early the next morning the two missing men found their way to camp. X From Macksville a detachment was thrown across the country to the Lebanlon pike, to threaten Danville from the southwest. "Thtis looks but little like getting to Louisville," 7said Charley, despairingly, to Lawrence and Brent, as the three paused for a few iminutes' rest beneath the shade of an old sycamore-tree that stood by the roadside. He. sighed deeply, while his expression grew noticeably sad. "Oh, don't be so down-hearted," remonstrated Brent. "Why, Charley, you have grown to be the unhappliest of luckless wights. Wlhat has wrought such'a change in you? You were formerly full of spirit and fun, but now you are spiritless, and full of sighs and sorrows. You haven't smiled half a dozen times since it was known that we were turning back into Kentucky. You must be sorry at the promise of getting home. Colne, come, you must rally, my friend. Never mind the sweetheart now. We must whip the Yankees first, achieve our independence, and then woo and win the fair Desdemona."     178        RAIDS AND ROMANCE Charley paled, then reddened at the remarks of his friend. Did Brent know his secret? How could he have heard it? If not, why should he have spoken as he had just done? He endeav- ored. to reply, but could only stammer out a few incoherent words, while his color deepened, and his whole manner becamie con- fusedl "' aught, Charley, caught, my boy," exclaimed young Morgan, who, with Curd and Irving and two others, had joined the group undei the tree. "You need not dehy it. We all see you are in love, and desperately too. Now make a clean breast of it, and tell us all about the fair one. We will sit here on this grass, and listen to your tale of love and-trial, and perhaps we will all relate our stories." "qapital suggestion, Cal. What say you, Charley?" called out young Curd, as he dismounted, and throwing his bridle rein over this horse's neck, seated himself on a projecting root of the tree. i"I sympathize with you, Charley, for I too remember well a dark eyed girl of Lekington. Cal., you can't appropriately laugh at Charley. You are wild now to get back to see your lady- love. Remember your fancies at Lebanon." o (Coine, Ed., you are not going to betray me. Don't you know you Lre masonically bound to keep my love affairs secret?" "Oh no, Cal., I'll not betray you; but I have no idea of laugh- ing Charley out of his spurs, when I'd venture, if the truth was known, we are all in the same fix." "Don't doubt," interposed Irving. "I own up to the weak- ness." "B ut, boys, you have the advantage of Charley and myself," interposed Lawrence. "You expect very soon to be at home, where you can enjoy the delectable society of your lady-loves, while we have not the most remote prospect of such happiness." "Oh, don't speak so discouragingly of our chances, Lawrence," ejaculated Brent, rising from his seat. "There is hope for us. What shall we do when we get to Frankfort, but sweep down on Louisville? The good people there will wake up some morning to the clatter of our horses' hoofs, as we dash along its sounding streets, and the cry will ring out from square to square, Louis- ville is fallen! Louisville is fallen! John Morgan and his men have got possession of us sinners!'" The boys shouted in wild merriment as young Brent closed his description. "Come, boys, dismount, and refresh yourselves in this grateful   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        179 shade. Why do you set perched up there on your horses in that burning sun?" "Indeed, boys, we must hasten on," replied young Morgan, taking out iis watch, and looking at the hour. "You know we must pay our respects to the Danville Home Guard before dinner." With jes; and laughter the detachment of thirty sped along, little dreaming of the wild dread their approach was sending into the hearts of the good people of Danville. , , ,',1             l     180        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER XXXII. DANVILLE ,AND ITS DEFENDERS. IF the consternation of Lebanon and Shelbyville was great, what shall be said of Danville, that seething cauldron of Unionism?-- the birthplace of Colonel Smith Fry, who, with brutal coarseness, boasted that L" he killed Zollicffer!" and of General Jeremiah S. Boyle, who has publicly asserted that "he would wade through the blood of his wife and children rather than this rebellion should succeed." Glorious patriots! How approvingly humanity must laud your noble sentiments! Colonel Morgan's deeds at Lebanon had reaclled the anxious ears of the Danvilians, and filled their hearts with terror. They knew their guilt in oppressing the Southern nien in their midst, and' while, like the Babylonian king, they saw the handwriting on the wall, fear seized their souls. There was alarm, anxiety, consternation, depicted on every face. Fear and confusion charac- telized every movement. The cry went out for "help, help!"  The captain of the Guard, who lived two miles out in the country, on receiving the frightful news of Morgan's approach, galloped into town with all the dignity befitting his position and the momentous crisisI al- though it required but a glance to perceive that he was q aking within. Runners were sent to and fro to inform the Home Guard to assemble immediately. The money was taken from the bank, deposited in an express- wagon, placed in charge of Mr. Rice, a rabid old Unionist, who, mounting the seat, dashed off as fast as the horses could go to- wards Lexington, with instructions not to stop short of Cincinnati. Ladies gathered together their silver and other valuables, and boxing them up, dispatched them,r post-haste, to a place of safety in the country. They buried their linen and bedding, and bidding a hurried adieu to their homes, jumped into carriages, wagons, and every available vehicle, and left for safer points. Old men, whose heads were bleached by age, suddenly fired   OF MORGAi AND HS MEN.         181 with patriotism, seized their guns, and rushed out " to defend their homes from the lawless invader." Some wag facetiously. named the heroic band of venerable sires ' The Silver Grays," and it was serio-comic to see them strutting around armned cap-a-pie.         Through the desperate exertions of the bustling captain, mat- ters at last assumed somewhat of form. About sixty men were assembled, armed, and ready for the fray. Pickets were thrown forward on the Lebanon, Perryville, and Harrodsburg roads. Morgan was advancing upon the city, no one knew from what point. Itere, as at Shelbyville, the-wildest and most contradic- tory rumors filled the streets. Finally, scouts were sent out to ascertain the truth of the matter. The one sent forward on the Lebanon pike, came dashing into town after a half hour, in thle highest degree of excitement, breathless with fear, his eyes start- int from their sockets, and his whole appearance that of a mnadman. "IIe had seen Morgan, no (doubt about it, and llis men covered the whole face of the earth. No use trying to hold the town- men enough to take away every house, not to talk about people." When this most alarming intelligence was received, the town became frantic. Men - lurried to and fro as if an evil deity had imposed on them this fearful penance to expiate some dreadful crime. Wonen, pale withl affright, dashed through their houses, seizing on any thing that imet their hands, to bear it off to some secure point, or stood hopelessly despairing at front doors and windows to hear the latest news. Children, following the example of the men and women,' drove about like masqueraders at carnival. Hurried consultations were held at every corner of the streets, but no onelcould tell what was best to be done. At length, after much general debate, it was decided to move out the armed force to Dix River Cliffs, and there fortify. This point was six miles from the town, and in a direction dia- metrically opposite to the one from which Morgan was expected. Accordingly, this gallant band of patriots darted out pell-mell, ;some mounted, some on foot, to begin their all-important work of "fortifying Danville," six miles out, and fully twelve miles from the nearest advance of the enemy. During this last scene, to the ludicrousness of which no language could do justice, some Southern boys, who had been hugely en- i  joying the fright of their Union neighbors throughout the day, conceived the idea of heightening the effect of'the dr(.Iina. Understanding that the "r oble defenders" were to march out     182        RAIDS AND ROMANCE and begin active prepa ations for the erection of suitable fortifica- tions, they hired some negroes to follow after them at rapid pace with empty wagons. Then setting out before the armed heroes, the boys reached the Cliffs first, and secreted themselves where they could hear all that passed, without being themselves observed. On, amid the deepening twilight, at break-neck speed, the brave band moved towards the river, each one discoursing on the mo- mentous crisis that had overtaken them. Suddenly, as they were nearing their Thermopylae, a strange and fearful sound met their ears. What could it be? they asked each {other in breathless anxiety. Were they pursued? Was the dread enemy hard after them? It must be so. Dreadful thought!   ! ' Hist! Hist, boys, be quiet; let Ine listen," said one of their number-Jack Webb, by. name--a very important personage, in- deed, since he had been at the battle of Fishing Creek. ' I know all these war sounds, and can tell in a minute the noise of cannons, and horses, and infantry, and all such things. Stop, men, and be riglit still while I listen. I can soon tell whether it is the enemy or not."  Every thing halted in breathless suspense. Jack stooped down and placed his ear close to the pike. It was a moment of fearful expectation. "Can't tell, boys, yet; sounds mighty like the enemy: wait a moment till it comes a little nearer." It was asking a great deal of these patriots to wait until the en. *  emy should get a little nearer, but they submitted most heroically. "You stop here, boys, and I'll go back to the top of the hill yonder. Maybe I carihear better there." Jack had gone but ' minute, when he came rushing wildly back, crying out at the top )f his voice, "Enemy, boys-T-ying artillery -enemy upon us fast as they can dash; no mistake!" Just then the report of several pistol-shots reverberated\ along the cliffs to their right.  4"The enemy is upon us-every man look out for himself!" was the order of the terrified captain. In a moment, the men were scattered in wild confusion, each one- rushing for dear life along the road that led to Nicholasville, twenty miles distant; nor did they stop until that point was gain- ed. Never was there a more inglorious finale of warlike' prepara- tion for defence. Surely the bards of Danville, through all com- ing time, will delight to sing in stirring verse the heroic deeds of her brave defenders.    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         183 CHAPTER XXXIII. A LOOK AT LOUISVILLE. "FATHER,. father! do see here!" exclaimed Mary Lawrence, eagerly, as she rushed into the breakfast-room, a few mornings after the party at Mr. H.'s. Her face was beaming with delight. The soft, auburn curls were thrown back from the blue-veined temples, her cheeks were of the brightest rose-hue, while her large, blue eyes spoke out from their soft depths, as gladly as if the soul. within had received a heavenly inspiration. With her bright, airy morning-wrapper, confined at the waist with a Simple sash of blue ribbon, floating out on th'e breeze as she entered through the open door, she looked more like a Hebe than a child of human mould.  Here, father, here, do read that," and holding the paper before him, while she threw an arm around his neck, she called his atten- tion to an editorial paragraph. Pausing a moment for the father to read the announcement, she exclaimed, "Isn't that glorious news? John Morgan coming into Kentucky-coming right here to Louisville, and will bring brother and all our friends with him I Oh, I am wild with delight. What a blissful time we shall have i" "' But, perhaps, Colonel Morgan will not reach Louisville, my cllild, even if he should come into the State." \ "Oh, yes he will, father. Don't you see old Prentice is scared out of his wits; and that, you know, is a fine indication. I am sure the Confederates will come to Louisville!"And Mary clapped her hands and commenced to waltz gracefully round the breakfast- table. "Oh, my child, do not grow too ecstatic," said the mother, gaz- ing with a look of tender, reproachful love upon her beauitiful daughter. "It is scarcely possible that Colonel Morgan will reach Louisville. His force cannot be sufficient to take the city; and, O moreover, there is nothing here to induce him to come. I judge the object of his visit to our State is to obtain recruits and horses, neither of which he would find here." An expression of sad disappointment, in a moment, overspread the young girl's face and manner. She threw herself into her ac-     184        RAIDS AND ROMANCE customed seat at her mother's right, and supporting her headlwith her hand, while her elbow rested on the -table, looked inquiringly into her mother's face. Mrs. Lawrence was'a woman of most excellent judgment, and her word had ever been law with her household, because every member of the family daily felt her superior wisdom and justice. She was one of the loveliest of women, gentle, kind, thbughltful, and, at the same time, firm, decided, even unyielding in a matter of right. She had been deeply pious from her earliest girlhood, and the Spirit of all grace in her heart, lhad moulded he/ manner and expression of face into sweet conformity to its own gentle teach- ings.. She had, for a long while, been a great sufferer, her bodily infirmities increasing with each year, and now she was so enfeebled as scarcely to be able to leave her house. But! while thus slowly passing to the far-off larnd, mid pain and weak:ness, she grew day by day strong in faith, and that abiding hope which-irradiates with heavenly beauty the darkest path ever pressed by the weary feet of the earth-pilgriln.    e "O, father, don't you think Colonel Morgan will c mre here? He has so many Louisville boys with him; and then it would be such a satisfaction to us Southern people. He ought to come to release us from bondage, if nothing more. And there is old Pren- tice. Morgan ought to have him and ride him down to Dixie. A trip of this kind, I am suare, would improve his morals. Don't you think it is possible that the Southerners may come here, father?" "No, my daughter. You need not revel in that anticipation. I am convinced they will visit central Kentucky, remain there a short time, and then leave the State." "Too bad-too bad!" ejaculated Mary, as she raised the cup of coffeelto her lips and sipped it. Placing it nervously back in the saucer, she looked thoughtful for a few moments, and then her face lighted up with the new ideas that flashed through her mind, and, smiling to herself, she again sipped the coffee, and glancing up to her miother, was about to speak, when she suddenly checked herself and remained silent. The mother's sweet, sad face was very thoughtful. Her heart was with her boy. She longed to see him once nore before her eyes should close in death. She knew her stay on earth must be brief: that before the flowers should fade, and nature clothe her- self again in the emblems of death, she might be quietly resting from her labors beneath the green hillock. The father folded the paper, and mechanically placing it beside him, fell into a grave, quiet mood.   OF MORGAN ANIY HS MEN.       185 The door-bell rang. Mary started nervously. The servant entered, bearing a card from Captain Morton, and handed it to her young mistress. It was a request for the pleasure of Miss Law- rence's com pany for an evening ride. An apology for the early intrusion accompanied the note. He was going inlmediately to thile country, and would not be back until the afternoon. "Bring me my escritoir, Maria." The girl obeyed the bidding. The mother -looked at her daughter for an explanation. Mary never had any secrets from her loved parent-only one thing, her engagement with Charley R., had she ever withheld. 'Fr om Captain Morton," she answered to her mother's inter- rogatory look. "He wishes me to ride with him this evening at five o'clock." "And will you, go?" "I cannot, mother; I have other plans."  The servant returned with- the writing-desk. Mariy took fromn it a card, penned a deli- cate refusal, and enveloping it, dispatched it to the servant in waiting at the door. Mother," said the young girl, breaking the silence that had reigned for several minutes, "I should like to go to Frankfort this evening." The mother looked up astonished at the request. "Go to Frankfort, Mary! when that country will be filled with armed Inen in conflict!" "Ah, they will not hurt me, mother; I have no fear. I wish so much to see brother; and I am sure I shall do so, if I can only get into central Kentucky."   I ould you go alone, my daughter?" '"Oh, no; I am sure cousin Frank will gladly accompany me. May I go if he will? Say, father, won't you consent? You know cousin will take good care of me." "I don't know, Mary, that you will be in any danger in going to Frankfort; but I do not think you will get to see your brother." "But. let me. go. May I, mother? What do you say? You won't object, I know e" "You must first see if your cousin Frank will go with you. I could not permit you to set out without him." "Olh, I will go and see him. I am sure he will be delighted to Ilhave an opportunity to take a little recreation.';! Mary sprang from the table and ran to her own room, enthusi- astic at the thought of accomplishing the plan that had so forcibly presented itself to her as she sat tasting her coffee.     186       RBAIS AND ROMANCE In an incredibly short time she was bonneted and ready to set out. As she reached the door, she encountered Captain Morton. His face was clouded, and his look one of unusual sternness. Mary started back as she beheld him. Recovering herself, she in- vited him into the parlor. "I wish to see you for a few minutes only." She motioned him to the hall sofa. "I called, Miss Mary, to see why you refused to ride with me this evening. It is the first time, and I, of course, felt surprised." He fixed a penetrating look upon her as he spoke. Feeling that he had no right to address her thus, the young girl straightened herself up, and with most perfect calmness replied: "I have other engagements for the evening, Captain Morton. I presume this explanation will suffice," and she compressed her lips and assumed an air of hauteur which repelled further inquiry. The color rushed to the face of the excited captain. He was foiled. Seeing and fully appreciating the hopelessness of any furthei attempt to secure a satisfactory explanation, he took his hat frjm the stand, and, bowing stiffly, left. Twd o'clock came. The hour found Mary, escorted by "cousin" Frank; at the depot, ready to take the cars.  "Por Lu! She will be so sorry that she went to visit her firiepdg in Ohio, when she hears that Morgan has been in the State. She set out yesterday morning for Cincinnati. Did you see her, Frank?" "Only in passing. She has not been to see us since the party at Mr H.'s. I haye met her on the street once since then, and she only bowed coldly and passed on. Something is wrong with her, I am sure. I intended to go out and see her, and ask her what it is; but mother, you know, has been so feeble most of the  time, I did not wish to leave her. Oh, I am so happy she is better now!'  The car-whistle sounded. Mary and her cousin entered and seated themselves. A few minutes more, and they were merrily speeding their way to the "City of Hills."   J'S  oF OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.           187 CHAPTER XXIV. THE PANIC INCREASES. "EAVING Macksville on Sunday morning, Colonel Morgan pressed forward to Harrodsburg, which point he reached about noon. As the column rode listlessly along, the colonel conversing with Captain Duke and Colonel St. Ledger, on their recent successes and future plans, Morgan's keen eye discerned in the distance two suspicious-looking horsemen. Calling upon Captain Castleman he ordered hin to take four men with him and pursue. The five, driving the rowels deep into the sides of their horses, dashed forward. They had been gone but a short time before they were seen returning, bearing with them as prisoners a Federal captain and lieutenant. On reaching Harrodsburg, Colonel Morgan found that the Home Gua rd from all that section of the country had fled to Lexington. Receiving no encouragement from the citizens to protect them, and deeming their own personal safety could be far better secured by flight than fight, they had precipitately set off at the first note of alarm. Thle whole population of the town turned out to welcome Mor- gan and his gallant men. Ladies and children appeared on the streets to hail them as friends. Handkerchiefs Were waved from every window, and bouquets, arranged with artistic taste, were showered upon their passing ranks. Smiles, cheers, and pleasant words met them everywhere. Gaining the public square, Colonel Morgan ordered his men to halt and alight. In a moment the boys were surrounded by men, women, and children, eager to shake their hands and present them with every token of sympathy and respect. The few Union individuals in the town, whether from policy or admiration, vied with their neighbors in acts of kindness and re- gard. The scene was like a grand holiday occasion, where every one, happy himself, felt it a pleasure to contribute to the happiness of every one he met.     188        RAIDS AND ROMANCE The men were invited into private houses to dine, and when  they refused, because of their dusty and neglected appearance, baskets, laden with the nicest edibles, were sent 'out in the great- est profusion. There was scarce a housekeeper in all the town who did not that day prepare some dainty for "Morgan's men." And an old nion man, who had hitherto trembled at the very name of Morgan, providing himself with a basket of the best his wife's pantry pould afford, went in person to present it to the dreaded chieftain, who received it with such a pleasant smile and polite' bow, as completely won the lifelong admiration of old Mr. Sa- vant. After having partaken of the kindly cheer of the good people of Harrodsburg, Colonel Morgan set outi for Lawrenceburg, twenty miles distant. In the meant tilme, he had sent forward a detach- inent to threaten Frankfort on the left, and another to menace Nicholasvile onthe right. The whole country was in an uproar-Frankfort, Lexington, Nicholasville, Lawrenceburg, Versailles, were all seriously menaced. The HomeGuard had fled in the wildest confusion from, the minoi' towns, and concentrated in Lexington and Frankfort. At the latter point there was assembled a force of about three thousand Home Guards and regular troops. Nicholasville and Versailles were deserted. The shops were all closed, and the citizens awaited in anxious suspense the approach of the formidable column. In Lexington' the scene was widely different. Dispatches had been sent to Cincinnati for troops to assist in defending the place. All business was suspended-the stores shut up. Persons might be seen hurrying to and fro through the streets, as if bestirred by tihe fearful voice of an earthquake. Martial law ras proclaimed, and every man found on the street was immediately placed under arms. It was more than a man's life was worth to whisper the name of Morgan. A citizens' guard was organized, and authorized to arrest or shoot down any man found unarmed on the streets, so eager was their thirst for the blood of Southern sympathizers. Various rumors, wholly conflicting with each other, were caught up and repeated at every corner of the streets by men'whose fa- naticism manifested itself Albne in curiosity and excitement. "Morgan wasat Midway  Morgan was at NicholasvilleI Mor- gan was approaching the town fromn Versailles Morgan was en- tering Harrodsburg! Morgan was within six miles of the city with ten thousand men!"   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         189 Then came the thrilling tidings that the fight had commenced at Frankfirt. Vhat should be done? Could troops be spared for poor besieged Frankfort? If men were sent, might not the ubiquitous Morgan suddenly swoop down upon Lexington? The Eighty-fifth Ohio, under Colonel Sowers, had just reached the city ffrom Camp Chase. It Was decided to dispatch this regiment to the relief of Frankfort. But one company mutinied outright. It was mnre than they had bargained for. They had set out for Lex- ington, and would not go a mile further. The officers took the matter in hand, and after some coaxing, mixed with threats and curses, they succeeded in bringing the men to the point of ac- quiescence, and 'off the troops set, at railroad dash, for Frank- fort. All these movements being made known by telegraph in Louis- ville, that great city was thrown into a state of the most ludic- rous confusion. Troops were ordered over from Jeffersonville; regiments were recalled from the Nashville road; bank vaults were robbed of their contents, which were inclosed in strong boxes for ready shipment across the river. Drays were kept in readiness for this purpose before the bank doors. The greater portion of the type of the daily press was packed up, and landed safely on Indiana soil. Armed men were rushing about, seemingly with no other object in view than to scare timid men and women out of their senses. Forces were hastened to the Lexington depot, but scarcely had they reached there before the order was coun- termanded, and they were marched back again. Headquarters were besieged by crowds of pale and anxious citizens, eager to catch onb item of reliable information. The streets were literally  blockaded by the rushing mass, all on the gui vive for intelligence from Morgan.  Cavalry from Nashville cashed through the crowded streets, their headlong speed and clanging swords adding to the already wild furore. News came that Morgan was at Shelbyville, and would be at Louisville that night. Then ran along the seething multitude the rumor that martial law had been proclaimed, and every'man capa- ble of bearing arms was to be called out in defence of the city. This soon silenced, to a great extent, the crowded streets. Many of the Union patriots were unwilling to risk themselves in the presence of Confederate bullets, and deemed it more prudent to retire to their own peaceful dwellings, and there keep as quiet as their excited nerves would permit them to do.     190        RAIDS AND ROMANCE During the grand melee Southern sympathizers looked on at the farce with inward satisfaction: They did not for a Inoment believe that Morgan would attack the city, but they were quite/ willing that their Union friends should think so. While this fearful panic was shaking Louisville, Frankfort, and Lexington to their centre, giving rise to numberless ridiculous scenes, Colonel Morgan was quietly pursuing his way, as we have said, from Macksville, through Harrodsburg to/Lawrenceburg. Reaching this latter place Sunday night,] Morgan remained until his scouts camne in from Frankfort and, other points. He then proceeded to Versailles, crossing the Kentucky river at Shryoqk's ferry. Here he found the boat sunken in the- stream by the Home Guard as they moved on in their ignominious flight to Lexington. About sunset on Monday evening Colonel Morgan, at the head of his command, entered the streets of Versailles, twelve miles distant from Lexington,;and about as far from Georgetown. "Here, boys, is a rich prize," said the colonel to his men, as dashing along the street he discovered about three hundred horses and mules belonging to the Federal government. ' If any of you have sorry horses, here is a fine opportunity to exchange them for better ones. Help yourselves. Uncle Saml will not dare to enter a protest, I presume."  The little band was now situated in/ the midst of the enemy. At Lexington, on their immediate right, and only twelve miles distant, there was a considerable force under the commandant of the post, Brigadier-general Ward. At Frankfort, about equi- q^n ^ distant on their left, were three times their number of men, sone of them regular troops. Either point could be reinforced at a few hours' warning. Colonel Morgan fully appreciated the danger. He ordered pickets thrown out on every outlet from the town, and command- ed that his men should hold themselves in readiness for attack at any moment. The men sat sleeping on the pavements, their bridles resting in their hand, their arms beside them, ready at a moment's warning to mount and meet the foe. But no foe came., He was glad enough to be left to act on the defensive. At dawn on the following morning, the command was ordered to be ready in an hour to set out for some other point. Promptly the command was obeyed, and as the sun, climbing up the sides of the morning, threw his first beams over the summer's land- scape, the whole force set out at a brisk' pace for their unknown I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        191 X destination. The Lexington boys hoped to be led to their homes and friends; the Louisville boys turned their anxious, longing thoughts towards that city. "Not to Lexington to-day, boys," said Captain Castleman, with a sigh, as the column advanced along the road leading to Midway "But, I do hope we shall yet have an opportunity to look in on our friends and sweethearts before we leave this part of the State." "Really, it doesn't look much as if we shall, Castleman," re- plied Irving. For my part, I think I shall don mly Lincoln blue,' and try my hand at deceiving the Yankee pickets. What say you Curd and Morgan? Wouldn't you venture this much to see those lovely girls you were speaking of a day or two ago?" "Aye, and more than this, Irving, for the accomplishment(of an object so desirable. Just insure us we shall see those angklic beings, and get back with whole )ones, and we'll risl every Ihing. Won't we, Cal.? "Any thing, Curd, short of grim death itself," responded young Mrgan.  "But, Morgan, how is it--" "Halt!" rang' along the line, suddenly breaking in upon the young men's fancies and earnest conversation. "Morgan!" called out an aid, dashing to the rear. "Thi col- onel wants his brother iznmrediately."  The column was rapidly nearing the Lexingto  and Louisville railroad. Colonel Morgan had been informed that the train firom FrAnkfort, having on board two regiments of Federals, would be due in a few minutes, and hb determined to secure it. Accordingly, he dispatched a squad of men to tear up the track in fiont. Another force was ordered to look to their guns and station themselves in position on either side of the road; while yet another company was given charge of the howitzers, which were so placed as to fully command the road at the point where it was supposed the cars shou ' stop. Colonel Morgan, with his operator, Mr. Ellsworth, repaired to th e telegraph office,'and took possession. They had been but a 'few minutes there, when a telegram from Lexington came flashing along the wires. "Is it safe to start the train from Lexington? We hear Morgan is on the road." "All safe-let the train come," wwas Ellsworth's answer. Immediately preparations were made to give the train due re-     192        RAIDS AND ROMANCE ception. Breathlessly the men waited. Drawn up in line of bat- tle, for one hour they stood momentarily expecting the prize. But the alarm had been given, and the trains retraced their steps in hot lhaste-one to Lexington, the other to Frankfort. i Being convinced that the enemy had been warned, and that noth-  ing could be gained by longer delay, Colonel lIorgan moved on towards Georgetown. As he neared the town, he was informled that some Home Guards had assembled to dispute his entranpe. He halted, and sent in h demand for surrender. But nowhere vere armed men to be found.  Like their copatriots of other places, they had precipitately fled to Lexington for safety. At Georgetown, as in Harrodsburg, shouts of welcome greeted the approachI of the Confederates. Every preparation was made by the citizjns to entertain them in a manner worthy of their chivalrous deeds and gallant daring. All knew and appreciated the brilliant record these noble men had made in defence of liberty and right, and they dared to mani- fest their approbation, though it might cost. them their freedom and property. Union men were everywhere left unmolested. Many had fled, leaving their families behind them. Some remained, willing to trust the magnanimity of Colonel Morgan, whose conduction all occasions had taught them that they had nothing to fear at the hands of Kentucky's noble son, \I(2 I                  i   OF MORGAN AND   IS MEN.      193 I    l CHAPTER XXXV. l    UNNEXPECTED HAPPINESS. As the troops were passing in column along the tmain street of the town, amid the glad cheers of the ladies and child-ren Whlo everywhere thronged the pavement, Charley's attention was sad- denly arrested by hearing his name pronounced in soft, clear toneo. Hle looked in the direction from whence the sound proceeded, and discovered a group of females standing on the front balcony (, one of the houses to his riglt. One was slightly in advance of the others, leaning over the banister and waving a kandkerchief to the soldiers, as they slowly filed along. She was dressed in a simple white iuslin, confined at the waist a long sash of blue ribbon. A wreath of natural flowers gar- landed her soft auburn curls. Charley's heart stood still as his eye rested on this beautiful female figure, so like that of Mary. Bending forward, he gazed earnestly upon it. His eyes dilated to their fullest extent, and his lips paled with fearful anxiety. Could it be Mary? Ah, no-it was impossible. Surely he was mistaken! And yet so like--that' form, those curls, that sweet, glad face. It must be--and yet holw was it possible? ie gazed, and gazed, as one bewildered by some bright, fascinating object, which he could not comprehend, and yet from which he dare not turn. "Charley, Charley! don't you kno  me spoke the same Sweet tones.               spoke the same Ah, that voice-bhe could not mistake it. It must be Mary. It could be none other. His first impulse was to spring from his horse and clasp her to his bosom-his heart's own idol-the day-star of his destiny. But with more than rush of Alpine torrent, came the frantic thought, "Perhaps she is already another's!" and, turning in his Saddle, without even a bow, or look of recognition, he passed on. Ah, the anguish of that moment! What words can portray it? The hopelessness of despair crushes the human heart, and wraps rayless gloom our human life; we sink--we fall-prostrate, we     / I 194       RAIDS AND ROMANCE lie bleeding-but, ah, can the sufferer tell you what he feels? No human utterances ican describe the weight of unutterable woe that chains the victim down to misery worse than death itself, As may be imagined, our young hero knew but little of what transpired after this. What to him was the gay pageant, the loud acclaim of the joyous multitude? What to him that men, impelled  by admiration for all that ennobles our nature, all that elicits true and undying praise, were now regarding him as hero-deliverer? No eulogy, not the battle-trump could have aroused him from his deep, dull apathy. He moved amid the living throng insensate to its tumultuous applause.  An hour later, and Charley lay outstretched on the college- green, as one haunted by a strange, wild dream. He looked out on the beautiful town spread out before him; on the clear, smiling sky above; and then away on the charming landscape, bounded by its margin of green woodland that encircled the town. But none of these things gave him pleasure, or abated for a moment his deep, mental suffering. "Come, Chnrley, come; what are you doing here? You look more dead than alive, my boy. What's the matterwith you? Get up, get up. Mary says she wants to see y9u, as soon as you can get there." Charley gazed with an expression of perplexed inquiry up into his friend's face, as if he did not fully comprehend the meaning of his words. "Wants to see me, John? Are you not mistaken?"Then, pausing a moment, he asked, slowly, "Is your sister married?" "Married, Charley!" and John burst into a loud laugh. Pre- posterous, boy! You are certainly crazy. Here, let me feel your pulse and forehead. You must have b ain-fever, from your appear- ance. This July sun has been too hot for you. Come, get up, and take a refreshing bath at that spring yonder, and prepare as fast as you can to accompany me to see two of the most charml- ing girls in the world."  Charley looked up again into the face of his friend with an expression of doubt and anxious inquiry. He made no effort to arise.  "You are too weary to go, Charley. I will excuse you to Mary; but I know she will be sorely disappointed in not seeing you." "Do you really think so, John? Don't deceive me," said Char- ley. springing up as if animated by a new life. "I had thought   OF MORGAN AND HS IMEN.        195 olur sister was engaged to be married, and would not care to see an old friend."  "Engaged to be married to whom?" exclaimed th brother, in astonishmnent. "To Fred Morton.'" "Fred Morton, Charley! that Lincoln sycophant. Do you think Mary Lawrence would thus disgrace her brother? All, I understand it all; yes-yes," and young Lawrence shook his head kno vingly; it's all plain to me now. But we won't stop to dis- cuss this subject, my boy. Rest assured, Mary wishes to see you- and I am Isure she will never marry Fred Morton. Come, we have no time to lose. Time is fleeing, and the girls await us." Charley could not divest himself of the sad apprehension that i deepening into conviction, had so long hung like a death-pall over his soul. And yet, with that readiness to seize upon the faintest promise of good, so inherent in the young heart, he suffered him- self to hope that his friend's words were true, and that Mary might yet be his own. Hastening to imnprove his friend's suggestions, he was soon transformed in appearance, and ready to set out to meet Mary at the residence of M. Johnson, whose daughters had been her schoolmates and intimate associates. With trembling footsteps, and with conflicting emotions and thoughts filling his bosom'and racking his brain, he ascended the steps of the front balcony, and What years of dread and misgiving he lived in the few moments that intervened between the ringing of the door-bell and the a4- pearance of the servant to usher them into the parlor! Char- ley deposited his cap on the hat-rack ih the hall, and followed  his friend to the room. There, on te divan before him, sat Mary, more beautiful than Peri of ancient Parsee faith, She was robed in a simple dress of white muslin, with a chaplet of roses and. myrtle encircling her brow. As Charley entered the room, she sprang forward with all the love-look of oldheightened and ishe tensified by the joy of meeting.           in- The lover's doubts and fears were gone. It was the Mary of yore, the idol of his heart, that stood, in her purity and loveli- ness, before him. He could not be deceived. She ws true to im--faithful and constant as when they two had sat together beneath the old elm-tree, and plighted their vows. The shadows sPddenly lifted from his heart--his doubt and dread gone-his fearful apprehensions forever dead. -     196       RAIDS AND ROMANCEO His whole frame trembled with the intensity of his feelings. Happiness, such as the beings of a higher and brighter abode ex. perience, thrilled his soul, and awakened therein the most rap turous delight. How deeply he upbraided himself, as he sat beside her, and gazed into that beautiful face, and felt his whole being stirred by the soft, sweet tones of that gqntle voice, that he had ever, even for a mo- ment, indulged a suspicion of her truth! He wondered at himself to think that he should have credited idle rumors, when he had received from her whom he had known from childhood vows of eternal faith. An hour later, and the lovers sat on the balcony, in the soft moonlight. Never were there two happier hearts. Not a shade intervened to cloud their joy. Mary had fully explained why it was she had received the attentions of Fred Morton, the Federal captain. Their mothers had been intimate friends from childhood. The young man was the nephew of her mother's physician, to whose solicitous care and tender watching she believed she owed the possession of that inestimable boon, a mother's love. And, in addition to this, Mr. Morton, the father, had kindly aided her father at a time when, but for this opportune assistance, he would have failed in business and been hopelessly ruined. "I never loved Fred Mroton, Charley, you know this; but I  have known him ever since Ilknew any one, and the considerations I have mentioned I deemed sufficiently binding upon me to compel me to courtesy in my demeanor towards the young gentleman. I\ know what the world said. I know my friends censured me. Your sister, Charley, whom I have ever loved as my sister, turns coldly from me. Often has my heart bled, often have I wept at being thus situated. But I did what I was convinced was my duty. But had I known-had I thought it possible that you, Charley, would have distrusted me, for a moment, I would have hazarded all old family friendships, and rejected the attentions of Captain Morton. But I did not dream that you, Charley, could ever have cherished a doubt of me,-you who have known me so long and so well, to whom I have ever shown kindness and truth." The large tears that had been gathering in the liquid depths of those soft, blue eyes, rolled down the burning cheek and choked the young girl's utterance. "F 'orgive me, Mary; forgive me that I have thus sinned against you," and Charl'eyknelt before her, and clasped the soft, dimpled hand in his, while his broken words full well attested the strength   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        197 of his emotions. "I have wronged you, my angel-my life: have. doubted you, when I should have hurled from me the vile slanders on your pure fidelity: have blaled you, when I should have loved. Forgive me, Mary-oh, forgive me my folly, and reinem- bler not against me this horrid weakness, this irreparable guilt." The fast-flowing tears fell on his hand. He had but to read the sweet words of full forgiveness in that tear-dewed face, as the moonlight revealed it in all its living beauty. He clasped her in his arms, and pressed his lips to her flusling  cheek. They were reconciled, forever reconciled-full atonement had  been made, and thenceforth there should never arise one thought to mlar their perfect love. Sgfelt those two young hearts, as they sat there wrapt in the bliss of confidence restored, of forgiveness granted. Ah, alas! how poorly did they understand their own hearts-how little appreciate the influences of time and circum- st:nces! They forgot, while plucking the fair and blooming flowers of Eden, that "the trail of the serpent is over it all." -For several moments both were silent. Each -,bosom was too filled with bliss to find language. "But you did not tell me, Mary, how you chanced to be here in this little country town," said Charley, breaking the stillness. "Why, in this wise, Charley," she replied, something of her wonted vivacity speaking out in look and gesture. "Convinced by father's arguments that it would be wholly impossible for Colonel Morgan to reach Louisville, I importuned mother to per- mit me to come to Frankfort, under the protection of my cousin. She consented. When we reached Frankfort, we were persuaded, from the information we received there from Southern men, that you would certainly pass through this place, and cousin Frank took a carriage and brought me here." "And where is he to-night, Mary?" "Oh, you know he has a sweetheart out in the country about three miles from town. Notwithstanding we were hourly expect- ing you, he could not resist the magnet, and he is now with Miss Appleton. Hlook for him back every moment." "I thank God that we have met once mnore, Mary. Oh, you cannot tell what unutterable anguish I have endured under the belief that another had won from me that love which I hold as above life itself. I have told you of. Mary Brent's letter to her brother. This was the first intimation I received of the attentions of Captain Morton, and the consequent rumor that you were to     198        RAIDS' AND ROMANCE marry him. It came with such assurance of its truth, that II could  not--pardon me, Mary, I did you a great wrong, I know--could not doubt it. Love is jealous, you know, Mary, and the thought of another, a hated rival, coming in between me and the being of all others to me most dear, drove me to distraction. I sank as one suddenly overtaken by a fearful disease. Life lost all charms ti) me. I wandered as one demented, pursued by an evil spirit. The prospect of return to Kentucky gave me no joy, no hope. It was like saying to the criminal,-Come, walk and take the fresh air, we will go by the gallows whereon you must be executed on the morrow. I came, because it was unavoidable. When I reached Lebanon, Ben Spalding, all unconscious that he was thrusting poisoned barbs into my very soul, rgpeated to me/the rumor, as- serting on his own knowledge its truthfulness. I rose, dressed myself, and fled the house, unable Ito rest a moment linger beneath a roof where I had endured such agony of mind. And when, three hours ago, I saw you standing on this balcony, and heard you ccll my name, I looked coldly, distractedly upon you, and said to my- self, "What is she to mte? Even while I belhold he'r, another may call her his own," anal I resolved to die. I felt that I could not bear the insupportably burden of an existence that had been for- ever robbed of its light and joy. But, thank God, I now know that you are mine; that no image of atnother has ever, even for a mo- mnent, enshrined itself in the temple of your affections. And now, Mary, I again beseech you to forgive and forget this deep, un- founded wrong done you by my black, Iny infamnous suspicions. God forgive me, Mary--I feel that I have sinned against heaven in thus sinning against you!"  "Forgive you, Charley? My heart tells me that I should rather. plead with you for forgiveness. I now seei that, while doing what I believed to be a right, I did, all unnecessarily it is true, but, nevertheless, did surely lay'the foundation of all your unhappi- ness.

He-I pressed her more Closely to him. He was about'to speak, when a. footfall on the steps attracted their attention. It was Frank Car- /ter, Mary1s4 cofsin, just returned from the country. "And Morgan has come, cousin!" he exclaimed, as soon as he 5*   OF MORGAN AND H,  S MEsN.      199 caught a glimpse of Mary. "Where is John? I arnm almost crazy to see him. I understood he was here." Charley stepped forward. Young Carter recognized him in stantly.   X "Why, Charley, my friend, is this you? How do you do , I am so glad to see you!" and he stood shaking the young soldier by both hands, looking him intently in the eye, his face-beaming with the happiness the meeting witth his old friiend gave him. "And where is John, Charley? Isn't he with you?" "He accompanied Miss May to the ice-cream saloon a short time since, but will be back in a few minutes, I suppose."  I The three passed into the parlor. In a few minutes, Miss Jenny May and young Lawrence returned. Carter sprang from his seat, and clasped his cousin in his arms. They had been playmates in childhood, and the love of brothers characterized their whole life. "O, John, I am so glad to see you once more safely back in old Kentucky! In the name of all the true hearts in our once prond, but now degraded State, I welcome you. May you 'be one of the noble braves to drive the 'hordes of abolition invaders from her bosom." ' "Join us, Frank; we need strong, young arms and nerved souls, to aid us in our work." "Have you a gun for me, John?" "Yes; can give you a complete outfit. Will you accept it, and cast your lot with us?"       j "With right good-will, John. I set out from home with that expectation. I have long desired a fitting opportunity to join you, and I am now ready. I go with you to-night." "And what will become of me, Frank? You know mother in- trusted me to you." "Oh, you will be taken care of. I shall assuredly provide for you., "Patriotism first, gallantry afterwards-first our country, then our, sweethearts. This should be the motto now, Mary; don't you think so, gentlemen?" asked Miss May. "Our country and our sweethearts, first and forever, Miss May, is the watchword of Kentucky soldiers. We fight for both, for both we die, but never yield either to the foe." The evening was spent most delightfully in song, music,and cheer- ful conversation. Southern songs were sung without restraint. No blue-coated spy paced the streets to search out " tireason."     200        RAIDS AND ROMANCh'  Charley and Mary again found the balcony. Love seeks no society save its ow. Time sped by with nimble feet. Charley lingered. To-morrow he might be torn away for the rapid march or bloody skirmish. Sweet were the words of love interchanged by these two young, trusting hearts. How brightly, wreathed with the halo of hopeful promise and joy, did the future outspread before theln! Love is a kaleidoscope which, however many new and rare combinations are presented, none are devoid of beautiful colors or symmetrical forms. "Time for us to leave, isn't it, Charley?" said young Lawrence, appearing on the balcony, accompanied by his 9ousin, Mr. Carter. "Can you guess the hour, my friend?"  ' Ten o'clock, I suppose," replied Charley, taking out his watch for the first time during the evening. "Ten o'clock, Charley!" cried Lawrence, laughing heartily. "Time must have passed pleasantly with you, truly. Wouldn't you think so, Miss Jenny and Frank? Charley says ten, my watch says five minutes to twelve. Charley has taken no note of time, the watch has measured every minute, so I suppose we shall have to take the testimony of the latter, and bid you ladies good-night." We soldiers don't often have the pleasure of ladies'society," responded Charley to his friend's badinage. "This must plead our apology for the present trespass. When we call again, we hope to be more thoughtful of your comfort and the prescribed forms of etiquette. Good-night, ladies," and, bowing politely, he de- scended the steps. His two friends, after promising to return on the porrow, " if circumstances would permit," bade the young ladies good-night, and followed his example. Descending the steps, and turning the corner of the street, they were soon lost to sight.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.      ,  201 CHAPTER XXXVI.  SUCCESS OF AN ATTEMPT TO VISIT LEXINGTON. IT had been concerted by Curd, Irving, Castleman, and young Moran, to visit Lexington in disguise, if they could obtain leave of absence until the following evening; This done, the four rested themselves up in a full suit of Lincoln blue, and about nine o'clock they set out on their perilous undertaking. They knew every mile of the way, having often travelled it, and they were also fully acquainted with the sentiments of every individual on the road-side, so that they had nothing to apprehend on the score of falling into Union hands. Their only danger on the way was the Federal pickets, which must, par necessity, be either evaded or deceived. But they also ran the further risk of being recognized by every individual whom they might meet in the city, and thereby be betrayed into Federal hands. But these young men were fond of adventure, and they cared not a whit how narrow the escape was, so they escaped. Indeed, the very danger they must be subject to throughout, only served to add zest to the scheme. The four, mounted on fleet horses and completely disguised, set out amid the shouts and cheers of their comrades, on their rather dubious expedition. Many were thewagers laid by the boys that they would be nabbed by the Yankees, and sent to the military prison at Louisville; but the young adventurers, corfident of suc- cess, in every instance doubled the sum that they would return the following night, with all the items ofnews known in the besieged city of Lexington.     i Present our regards to our friends in the city," shouted a dozen voice', as, laying whip to their horses, the merry quartette dashed off on their excursion. They rode at a rapid pace for five or six miles, heeding neither toll-gate nor the groups of two and three Federal soldiers which they passed on their way. When within five miles of Lexington, they halted to discuss and decide upon the best plan to be pursued. Morgan and Curd were in favor of attempting to pass the pickets on horseback. Irving     202   r     RAIDS AND ROMANCT4 and Castleman thought it best to dismount,lleave their horses at the house of a friend, and, avoiding the pickets, enter the city by a by-path. "We can deceive them, Irving, rest assured we can;" argued Morgan. ' They'll never suspect us; I'll give the Yankee twang so cmrnpletely, they'll swear I am a regular Down-Easter, and no mistake."   ' "But, Cal., is it not better to avoid them altogether? Then we shall certainly be safe." "But how can this be dore, and where shall we leave our horses, Irving? I would as soon the wretches would get me as my horse."  "Ah, I can manage that, Cal. There is an old friend 6f mine, just across the Way here, that will take good care of them until we come back. Once in his hands, and I'll wager my head the Feds , v will never get them."  "But how shall we void the pickets? They are as thick about the city as leaves in Vallamnbrosa, no doubt." "But certainly we can shun them better as pedestrians than we could on horseback." "But in the latter case; if we could neither deceive nor shun them, we could effect an escape; while if on, foot, they might shoot us and we ccnld make no effort to get away." "I will take the chances on foot, Cal. I am convinced it is the safer plan." "And I will trust to my ingenuity, blarney, and this good steed of mine to secure me a safe passage through, or a safe exit from the rascals." After a lengthy discussion on the subject it was fi ally agreed, as a test of the judgment of the respective parties, that Morgan and Curd should attempt the trip on horseback, while Irving and Castleman would essay it on foot. It was arranged that they should meet the next day, at two o'clock, to dine at Mrs. Morgan's, mother of the colonel, provided they succeeded in the attempt. Irving and Castleman turned through a gate to the right, to seek the house of the friend with whom the horses were to be left. Morgan and Curd, bidding them good-night, pursued their way along the pike. They rode on about a mile, planning their passage \ through the lines, when suddenly they came upon the pickets, seven or eight strong. Morgan rode forward. "Halt!" called out a Hoosier, thrusting his bayonet across the road. "Halt I I tell you, or I'll blow out your brains in a minute!"   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        203 "Two of the 51st Ohio," answered Morgan, with the veritable Yankee drawl," trying to escape from Morgan's mnen. Got caught out here, and came within an ace of being made prisoners. Had a hard time to get off. I tell you, these rebels iare regular dare- devils. Bully fellows, they." "Where's your pass? Let me see that." "Passi my friepd? How do you suppose we could get a {ass, when there was nobody to give us one? Our pass to-night were these two good steeds." Just at this juncture, four or five others, that had been sitting by the road-side, about half asleep, came up and joiped ttle Hoo- sier, who explained the matter to them, and asked their advice. Our orders are to let no one pass in or out," spoke a red-hair- ed man, whom Morgan immediately recognized as Bill Green, of the Lexington Home Guard. "And we can't disobey orders, if Morgan's men do catch you," added another voice, perfectly famni- liar to his ear. He looked over the group. There were four there that knew him well-the least circumstance might betray him. What should he do? To attempt to deceive them was risking every thing. They might recognize him at any mIloment. And how gladly would they seize upon him. What ,a prize!"Cal. Morgan, the brother of John Morgan!"All the papers in the land would be filled with the glad intelligence. They debated but a moment. Giving Curd the signal, he wheel- ed his horse, and started off at full speed. "Rebels! rebels!" and a htalf dozen bullets shredded the air around their head. One passed through young Curd's Lincoln cap. One glanced by Morgan's right foot, but no damage was received by either, as they;dashed on as rapidly as their horses could bear them, pursued by four of the picket-guard, who, mount- ing their steeds, set out to catch the rebels. The horses of the pursuers were fresh, and they were fast gain- ing on the two fugitives.  "Fire, Curd," said MorgIn. "Maylbe we can kill one of them: This will put an end to the chase." Curd obeyed the bidding, and fired. The shot was harmless. It was immediately replied to. Morgan turned himself in his saddle, and aimed at the man nearest him.  "Oh, God! I am shot-I'm  killed!" cried out the Yankee. His companions halted. Morgan and Curd took advantage of the confusion, and spurring     !A04       R! RAIDS AND ROMANCE their horses forward to their fullest spep.d,!daslhed bver the hill and out of sight. Nor diol they stop until they were assured they were beyond the guns of their enemies.               .        l There was hbgh merriment in camp as they told over tile story of their escape, and many a joke was perpetrated at their expense. It was one o'clock the following day. A young female, closely veiled, rang the door-bell of Mrs. Morgan's residence. A servant quickly appeared. ' Hand your mistress this card."                  v In a few minutes lMrs. Morgan entered the parlor. "Is your son at home, Mrs. Morgan ?" asked the girl in a whis- per, as the two seated themselves on the sofa. "Which one, Belle? What do you mean ?" asked the old lady in a voice of surprise. "Cal, Mrs. Morgan." "No, my dear. You surprise me by your question. What do you mean ? You did not expect to find him here, did you ?" ask- ed the old lady, tremnbling from head to foot. "Get your bonnet, Mrs. Morgan, and go Iwith me. My brother and young Irving are at my mother's, and wvant to see you. Be quiet; I'll tell you when we reacti the carriage. Let me call the seivant," added the young girl, as she saw the nervous statei of Mrs. M., who, unable to control herself, stood leaning .on tlhe table. The young girl placed the bonnet and shawl on the tremt bling mother, and led her to the carriage, ordering the driver to take the most private way home. The young girl turned to Mrs. Morgan, and said, " My brother and Mr. Imving reached home this morning about three o'clock. They avoided the pickets, and got in without difficulty. Your son and--" "Which son, Belle?" gasped the agitated mother, seizing her arll. "God grant John has not fallen into their bloody hands?" " No, no, Mrs. Morgan; it was not Colonel Morgan, but your younger son, Cal. It was agreed that he and Jack Curd should attempt to pass the Federal pickets in the dress of Lincoln sol- diers. They were on horseback. My brother and Mr. Irving set out on foot, and succeeded in getting safely through, and are now at my mother's. They were all to dine with you to-day ;; this was the agreement wtlen they parted. But brother thinks our house is watched, and he and Mr. Irving are afraid to leave. They sent me to see if your son and young Curd were with you, and if they were not, I was instructed to bring you home with me." " Oh, my child, my poor son! I am atfraid the Yankees liav6   6 MORtGAN AND HRS MEN.       205 got him. How shamnefully they will use himn, merely becaise he is a Morgan! My cup of grief is full-it overflows. Surely, I am stricken-hfflicted. But I must not falter. These are no times for fear and irresolution. My children fight for a just cause; I must trust them in the 1an1s of God. Have you seen the' morning       I;aper, Iny child? It they are captured, that, no doubt, conta is  the intelligence." "I have not, Mrs. Morgan. We do not take the Observer; but there is a boy with some papers. I will call him, and get one." The carriage was stopped; the boy called; the paper p r- chased. Eagerly the young girl looked over its columns, while Mrs. Morgan sat in breathless suspense at her side. "They were not caught, Mrs. Morgan. Here, listen how nar- rowly they escaped. I know this must be the account of it," and the young girl read the description of the scene as it had occurred the night before. "They were dressed in Federal uniform, Mrs. Morgan. I know they were so; there can be no mistake about- it. My brother and Mr. Irving are thus attired, and they told us your son and young Curd used: the same means to avoid detection." Thank God! my child is safe.' I should be very glad to see  in, but I would not have him risk his life to come to me. I have been trying all the morning to get a pass out of the city, but they would not grant me one. I feel I would risk every thing to see my children; but, with their brutal cruelty, they deny me this poor request, just because they know it almost breaks my- heart." The ladies alighted at Mrs. Castleman's door. Mrs. Morgan was shown up stairs into a private room, where she was welcomed by the two soldiers, who sat enjoying themselves in the midst of lends of both sexes, and of all ages. The heroes soon related to Mrs. Morgan's anxious mind the whole story, and assured her that the statement in the morning iper must be correct, as the description of the two men accorded precisely with the appearance of her son and his friend. Most happily the evening passed to these two men, prisoners as they were in the home of their birth; their rights as freemen trampled into the earth by a horde of Abolitionists, who had no are right on Kentucky soil than Caffres or Bushmen. Friend after friend called in, until the large room was filled with the young, the old, the gay, the sober, all anxious to see old ac- quaintances who now enjoyed the high reputation of being Mor- gan's men.     20)6       BRAIDS AND ROMANCE Having seen their sweethearts and friends, and obtained all tile information they could, the two set out to retrace their steps, and heroes they were dubbed, as at one 'clock that night they entered their camp at Georgetown, without a scratch or any such memento of an affray with the Yankees. Ah, what lasting memories gather around that midnight ex cursion I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         207 CHAPTER XXXVII. STAY OF THE CONFEDERATES IN GEORGETOWN. COLONEL MORGAN took possession of Georgetown on Tuesday evening, July 15th. The same evening, he issued the following proclamation to the people of Kentucky: "Kentuckians! I come to liberate you fron' the despotism of tyrannical fanaticism, and to rescue my native State from the hands of your oppressors. Everywhere the cowardly foes lIave fled from my avenging arms. My brave army is stigmatized as a band of guerillas and marauders. Believe it not. I point with pride to their deeds as a refutation of this foul assertion. ' We come not to molest peaceable individuals, nor to destroy private property, but guarantee absolute protection to all who are not in arms against us. We ask only to meet the hireling legions of Lincoln. The eyes of your brothers of the South are upon you. Your gallant fellow-citizens are flocking to our standard. Our armies are rapidly advancing to your protection. Then greet them with the willing hands of fifty thousand of Kentucky's bravest sons. Their advance is already with you. Then, ' Strike for the green graves of your sires I Strike for your altars and your fires 1 God, and your native land?" The citizens believed his words, and reinforcements assembled around his standard from Franklin, Scott, Trimble, Owen, and Bourbon counties. Brave hearts and strong arms rallied to swell the number of Kentucky's deliverers. On entering the town, Colonel Morgan immediately took pos- session of the press and telegraph office. The operator, a deep-dyed Lincolnite, declared, on a demand being inade for his apparatus, that it had all been packed up and sent to Cincinnati as soon as it was known the Confederates were marching on the place.' Colonel Morgan scanned the poor af- frighted felon from head to foot. He was a pretty good judge of men and circumstances, and feeling assured that the crnature was trying to deceive him, he in a very calm, decided tone, told him      208        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  he could make his choice of two things: either produce the battery,  etc., or take a trip with him South, to share the privileges of a Dixie prison. The man looked blank with astonishment. This fearful alter- native was wholly unexpected. His heart drew back in dread be- fore the horrid picture his excited fancy drew of the miseries of a Castle Thunder. He hesitated-looked confused-paled ind red- dened by turns. How could he convict himself of falsehood? He cast a furtive glance on the colonel, as he stood there calmly awaiting his decision. He saw the demand was imperative. Moving slowly towards the bed, he stooped down, and, with the look of a criminal, drew from its hiding-place all the missing ap- paratus. Colonel Morgan received it gracefully, at the same time ordering two of his men to take in charge the poor, trembling operator until further directions. Situated as Morgan was, in such close proximity to the enemy now assembled in force at Frankfort, seventeen miles 'in his rear, and at Lexington, only twelve to his right, and also rapidly congregating at Paris in front of him, it became necessary to act with the greatest dispatch and caution. A company of men, under Captain McMillan, was immediately sent out to effectually destroy the railroad between Midway and Lexington, and Midway and Frankfort, thereby preventing rein- forcements from being sent to Lexington. The boys performed this task with alacrity and success. They tore up the track, blew up the stone bridge, rendering the road wholly useless to the enemy, and returned in triumph to George- town. Scouts were also sent forward towards Paris, to ascertain the number and position of the troops at that point. The day following Morgan's entrance into Georgetown, as he was sitting in his office with Colonel St. Leger, Major Duke, and others, among whom were many of the first citizens of the place, an old man, of venerable appearance, was conducted in by two of his men, who informed the colonel that the visitor had intelligence of importance to communicate. The colonel rose, andreceived the old gentleman with a polite bow and pleasant smile, at the same time requesting him to be seated, which the visitor did with an air of simple modesty. Col1 onel Morgan scanned him closely from head to foot. He was a plain, unassuming farmer, dressed in homespun, and wearing a low- crowned beaver hat, which he now held in his hand. His coun-   OF MORGAN AND HS 3l N.        209 tenance was open, and expressive of ingenuousness and truth. C:,- onel Morgan was satisfied with the scrutiny. It was ilupossitle for sucJla mnan to be guilty of a desire to deceive. Excusing himself to his fiiends, and leading the visitor into a small ante-room, Colonel Morgan questioned him respecting the intelligence he bore. "I come, colonel," replied the old man, in a mild, respectful tone, which at once bespoke him a gentleman, to inform ou with regard to a Federal force at Stamping Ground, about twelve miles from here, which I think, sir, you can easily capture, with all their accoutrements."  Convinced that the old man's story was reliable, Colonel Morgan asked: "How many Yankees do you think there are in the force of which you speak?" "Only about seventy-five, sir. I myself have counted theml twice,' and both times I made that number." "Are they well armed, sir?" "Very well, colonel. First-rate guns and every equipment necessary."  "What have they besides their guns?" "Tents, wagons, and stores of every kind, which have been sent up recently firom Frankfort. And,"in addition to these, they have solne boxes of guns which have not yet been opened." "Can they fight pretty well, and have they a brave captain?" "Can't answer for the men, colonel; but their captain is as brave a man as ever lived." Are they looking for mny men, and have they mace any prepa- ration to receive them; and if so, of what nature, and where " "When I lef  ere, late yesterday evening, they were all in confusion, every moment looking for you to come down upon them. I judge, colonel, they are looking for you yet. They had no de- fence then, and I should think, from the scare they were in, that they have found no time for preparation of an, kind; your scouts could readily ascertain. this, colonel. Any ma n there would tell them." Colonel Morgan thanked the old gentleman kindly, and desired him to dine with him at the hotel. But the old farmer declined. "All he desired was, to be permitted to shake hands with the men, and bid them 'God-speed in their glorious cause." A guide was appointed to show the old man to the campe and introduce him to the boys. "Call Captain Hamilton," said Oolopel Morgan, to one of his aids.     210        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "Captain," said the colonel, as the young officer stood before him, "take with you one hundred men and proceed to Stamping Ground, break up the Federal encampment there, and capture all their stores, and report to me at this point."  The dashing captain set out with his men about noon. The road was fine, and, after a ride of an hour and a half, they came upon the Federal pickets, who fled at their approach, giving to the encampmeht the fearful intelligence that Morgan's whole force was marching into the village. In vain their captain endeavored to rally them for a fight. Ife itold them they could drive back thrice their number. But his ar- gurnents could not convince the frightened men that they possess- ed this wonderful amount of courage. They seized their guns, but, ifurther than this, they manifested no disposition to fight. They istood, fearful and irresolute. He assured them the enemy num- bered but about fifty men-that the pickets were scared, and did !not remain to see how many there were; plead with them to pro- tect their homes and families-to show themselves worthy sup- . porters of the glorious old flag which their forefathers had so no- bly defended. After much persuasion, he induced them to follow him a few iundred yards from their encampment, where he formed them in ne of battle. By this time the enemy could be distinctly heard, rapidly descending the hill into the village. The clattering of their horses' hoofs was fearful to the affrighted ears of the trembling men. i A young man of the place rushed up and cried out that Morgan, at the head of at least five hundred men, was dashing on to attack them. It was enough. The forces broke and ran, scattering in every direction. Each one sought safety where he thought it c uld best be secured. Some did not stop until they found themselves lost amid the high hills that bound the village on the north. Others secreted themselves in barns and houses, while others, finding escape im- possible, surrendered themselves and received their parole. Cap- t in Hamilton ordered his men to set fire to the tents, and destroy the g ns and stores. They then returned to the village, and, amid the onder of the gaping crowd, took possession of the medical and corm issary supplies, which soon shared the fate of the tents and guns. The victors remained awhile to rest and enjoy the hospitality of the friends who, as soon as they were relieved of the presence of the Lincolnites, hastened to surround them and congratulate them on their bloodless victory.    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        2" Recruits, to the number of seven or eight, joined them here, and were provided with guns taken from the vanquished Lincolnites. A detachment was sent under Captain Castleman, brother to the one who had so successfully entered Lexington, to destroy the rail- road bridges between Paris and Lexington. Success having crowned all of Colonel Morgan's plans, the bovs felt themselves safe in their present happy position, and gave then- selves up to erijoyment. They dashed out into the country, visited the farm-houses, where they were kindly received and treated to Kentucky's best cheer; called to see the ladies; partook daily of the nicest provisions, which were sent in the greatest profusion into the camp; laughed, danced, and sung. Colonel Morgan was waited upon by many of the best, citizens of the place, who dared thus to speak out their sentiments, despite the dark scowls and bitter threats of the Union neighbors. There was a physician in town, uncle to Major Gano, of the Texas squadron. This gentleman had been a rabid Unionist from the beginning'of the troubles, and was one of the first men in that community to advocate the formation and arming of a Home Guard company.. In consideration f his active services in obtaining arms and enlistments, he had been selected as captain of the body, but with his men he had ingloriously fled to Lexington, having first sent his family to the country. His residence wds in the suburbs of the town, and fronted by a most beautifulqawn. Into this Major Gano marched his command and encamped.  The Texas boys soon learned they were on the premises of one of their bitterest foes, and, fired at the thought, they vowed to destroy every thing before them. "Why should they protect the property of a man who was then under arms to kill tlem?" they argued, and with that spirit of "evil for evil" which inhabits the human breast, they set out to begin their work of destruction. The major, hearing of their intention, forbade any man's touch- ing any thing on the premises, and placed a guard around the house. And, a few days after, when the pqssessor returned, he found every thing in statu'quo, except some forage, which the men had been permitted to appropriate for their horses. The premises of other Union men were everywhere guarded  with the same fidelity. And instead of the ravage and ruin which always characterize the progress of the Abolition hordes, they left; behind them undisturbed homes and thankful, happy hearts. l"     212        RADS AND ROMANCE  sr ,\ CHAPTER XXVIII. THE PARTING.  IT was the evening of the second day of Morgan's occupation of Georgetown. Orders had lbeen given that on the'following nmorn- ing the whole-command mAust be ready to advance at an early hour. lBusy preparations for a move were everywhere made throughout the ranks, for the men well knew what Colonel Mor- gan meant by an earlylhour.  The dreamy twilight was gliding noiselessly over the earth. The sun declining behiid the western horizon, had left in his golden way a flood of light, which fell in mellow radiance over the soft summer's landscape. The stars, one by one, stole out from bellind their blue hidings above, and-looked quietly down upon the green earth. The moon sent out her silvery beams to add to the heavenly beauty of the scene. The meek-eyed flowers lifted lovingly their tiny heads to catch the kiss of the dooling zeplhyr as it sported on airy wing across the tufted lawn and waving meadows. With mingled emotions of joy and sorrow, Charley werded his way over the slope that intervened between the encamlpmlnt and the town. Old memories rushed through his mind. The past, the present, the future, each crowded upon his thoughts wiLh their promises, their sadness, until, bewildered, he could only feel-not think. To-night he should see Mary-perhaps for the last time. Should they meet again, it must be after years had run their weary round. Perhaps-and he shuddered at the thought-perlhaps the Angel of Death might come and intervene his dark wing-and they should never again meet until they should together stand before the Great White Throne above. He was passing through the beautiful lawn which bounds that famous1 stream, the "Big Spring of Georgetown," when he heard a ringing laugh, which was all too familiar to be mistaken. Seek- ing the point froml whence it issued, he found Mary, Jenny, and John reposing on the grassy mound, which rises like a throne   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        213 above the gurgling spring, the mossy haunt of the guardian naiad of these crystal waters. Charley approached them, and seating himself on the green car- pet beside the group, joined in the merry conversation, which was chiefly supported by Jenny and John. There was a want of inter- est in his words, and his air was that of one whose thoughts were far removed. Mary was silent and embarrassed. She, too, had essayed to joiln in the merry chat, but 'her words were without interest, her sentences left unfinished. Her eyes sought the ground, or looked listlessly out into vacuity; while the varying shades that passed over her now thoughtful and saddened face told the changeful feelings that thronged her bosom. Her soul was burdened with a fearful sorrow. Afar dff in the future she saw tl shadov which now fell so ominously about her, deepening and deepening, until it became impenetrable gloom. She had parted once before with Charley,-but then she felt no fear. All was bright and Ihopeful, and adown the opening vista she looked and beheld everywhere sunlight aqd joy. Why the change-this sad, this fearful change? She could not tell. There was no cause in the present for this dark foreboding. Why should she borrow sombre clouds from the future? She asked herself the question, and her heart answered, "Coming events cast their shadows before." But she would be cheerful; for Charley's sake she would cast away her despondency and be herself again. She made the endeavor, and for a few minutes succeeded in assuming her wonted gayety. But it was a desperate effort, and could not last. Charley observed the marked change in her manner, and it served to increase the sadness which was brooding so heavily over his own heart. I He looked on that sweet face, usually so radiant with smiles, and its thoughtful, pensive cast, rendering it tenfold more beautiful, was as a barbed arrow to his soul.  And those large, lustrous eyes, ever the home of gladness, now, despite herself, suffused with tears, spoke to his trembling, loving heart in tones of resistless eloquence the deep feeling that she was struggling to suppress. Charley led her slightly apart from the others, and seated her beneath the wide-spread boughs of an old oak-tree that crowned the summit of the gently rising slope.

Charley felt his heart bursting to tell her all he felt-all he hoped-all he feared-- but he knew not where to begin. "Mary," he said, at length, ' I go away from you to-morrow. This is the last time I shall see you for months-perhaps for years -indeed, Mary, we may never meet again. Ydu know the chances of war are uncertain ;" and he paused, unable ti proceed. Sup- pressing his feelings, he resumed: "We may never meet again on earth, Mary; but let me pledge you once more, here beneath these bending heavens, whose myriad beings witness-the vow, that in death as in life my love shall be yours. I need not tell you of that love, Mary; you know its depths-its constancy. But I felt, as I sat beside you on that mossy slope, that it was perhaps asking of you too great a sacrifice to remain pledged to me, when there seems to be so little promise of any consummation of our happi- ness. And here, Mary, I would say-though it is like driving the cold steel through my own bosom-that if you prefer, I will re- lease you from an engagement which, under the present circum- stances, may prove unpleasant to you. She turned upon him those large soft eyes, now filled with tears, and her voice was low and tremulous. "Charley, do you doubt me? Else why this proposal?"Thl tears gushed from her eyes, and streamed over her sad face. "Doubt you, Mary; doubt you! No! No!" he replied, with deep {earnestness; and he threw his arm around her, and drew her to his bosom. "Doubt you! never, never, Mary! Sooner would I doubt the words of Holy Writ than the love which, amid change and time, has shown itself unchanging-steadfast as the fouiida- i tions of the earth. I iknow your love is as true as the heavens themselves. But, Mary, you are young, beautiful, admired, court- ed, and is it not wrong-ask your own heart, is it not unjust to yourself-to bind yourself to one who has not now the remotest prospect of rendering you happy?" i' If you do not doubt me, Charley, and will promise to love me always, I ask no more;" and she looked up into his face with such a sweet trusting snrile, that Charley felt it to live the bliss of years in those few fleeting moments.  "It is enough, Mary!" he exclaimed, while his tears fell thick and fast, "I ask no more. I shall go feeling in the depths of my soul that, come what may, you will prove constant and true.

He drew forth a locket, and threw the chain about her neck. "Look at that, Mary, when I am gone,and remember always that I love you." He pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her long and fervently. 4"I go now, Mait. To remain, is but to torture both your heart and Oine.. God bless you--God bless you!" He kissed her one mo4e, and leading her back to her brother and friends, bade them farewell, and hastened away. li     216        RAIDS Al D ROMANCE CHAPTER XXXIX. THE TRAP--THE TA LES TURNED. ON the velvet grass, beside the Big Spring at Georgetown, lay the manly form of Colonel Morgan, stretched out at full length, reading the Cincinnati arnd Louisville papers of the previous day. "The trap has been laid," said the Louisville Journal, "and the horse-thief Morgan has fallen into it. He is now at Georgetown, with Frankfort on one side of him, Paris and Cynthiana on the other-with Lexington in his front-each point with as many men as he has in his whole command. There is no way of escape for him, unless he decides to betake himself to the Ohio river, where he will find ample} opportunity to cool the ardor of his patriotim n.  Caught at last, let every loyal heart rejoice that this traitor, thief, and coward, is soon to meet his just doom." ( We may expect to see the reckless guerilla chief, John Morgan, soon a prisoner in our city," said the Cincinnati Gazette. "Escape is now impossible. He is surrounded on all sides, and there is no outlet from the mesh which environs him, save through our city to Fort Warren." Caught at last," wrote the editor of the Commercial. John Morgan, the noted bandit and horse-thief, is at length entrapped. Reliable information locates him and his dirty followers at George- town, completely surrounded by our troops, who, under their gal- lant leaders, will soon make an easy prey of their victi m. He is now just in the situation we have long/desired to plac him, and the next intelligence we look for will be the announcement that the whole gang is bagged." i Ha! ha! ha!" broke out the colonel. Dashing the papers from him, he sprang to his feet and approached the murmuring spring. What's that, colonel, that pleases you so?" asked his adjutant. "Nothing, Alston, except that we are now completely entrapped by the Yankees; surrounded on all sides; no way of escape. Here, read for yourself. Great and mighty prophets, these Northern editors. But we'll see," and the colonel stooped and drank a re- fresling draught from the cool, crystal waters of the old spring V ell e,adteclnl toe n rn i   OF IMORGAN AND HS MEN.        217 "Castleman has left?" said the colonel, looking round from his stooping position to the adjutant, who stood reading the papers. highly amused at the startling announcements. "Two or three hours since, colonel. They have already reach- ed the railroad, and successfully accomplished their business, I hope, and are now menacing Lexington fromn the Winchester pike." "We must leave here at an early hour to-morrow morning, be- fore sun-up. Let every thing be ready, Alston. Harrison, with a company of seventy-five men, must menace Lexington from the Georgetown pile, as soon as the day dawns. If necessary, we must drive their pickets into the very town." Tlhe adjutant bowed, and left to carry out the orders. Colonel Morgin threw himself on the green sward to perfect his plans. The evening was very warm. The thermometer stood at ninety, but the thick foliage of the grand old oak, beneath which the col- onel reposed, shut out the sun's scorching rays. The breezes danced among the leaves overheard-the clear, limpid waters gur- gled at his feet.  "Dotards!" exclaimed Morgan to himself, laughing. "Do they think I would allow myself to be hemmed in and taken by them? Old Prentice will have another tale to tell his gullible readers be- fore the setting of to-morrow's sun." Colonel Morgan took a calm survey of the positiol- of affairs. All Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky were aroused, and from every available point, troops had been forwarded for the purpose of sur- rounding him and " bagging his whole force." Heavy reinforcements had been sent from Cincinnati to Cynthi- ana, and from thence to Paris. A large force was assembled at Lexington, at Frankfort, and at Louisville. But, as the road was destroyed between Lexington and Frankfort, no reinforcements could be furnished the former city by the latter. Lexington, if threatened, must depend for succor on Paris. This would relieve this point, and also greatly weaken Cynthiana. Castleman, on the morrdw, would advance upon Lexington from the direction of Winchester. Harrison, with his men, would, at the same time, threaten the city from Georgetown. This must necessarily create a panic, and the withdrawal of troops from the line of the Lexington and Covington railroad.  "What's the news from Frankfort?" asked Morgan of his cou- rier, as he rode up, covered with dust and perspiration. "About three thousand troops, colonel, and fortifying. Ex- pecting an attack every hour." 10 '/ /     ' 218       RAIDS AND ROMANCE "  Ah, hah!" ejaculated the colonel to himself. "All right-just as I desire."  The morning sun was just beginning to beam above the eastern horizon, when Colonel Morgan, at the head of his men, set off at a rapid pace on the road that leads from Georgetown to Oynthiana. They had proceeded but a few yards, when a courier dashed to his side. "How is Lexington?" inquired the colonel, checking his horse. All in consternation, colonel, since yesterday evening. It is believed that our men, to the number of several thousand, are moving on that place from Winchester; that the road to Paris was destroyed, and that you would attack the city early this morning. Couriers were immediately dispatched to Paris for re- inforcemnents just as soon as the news reached Lexington, and  troops had already commenced to pour in from that point when I left, about two hours ago." "Did you meet Captain Harrison and his men?" "I did, sir, half way to Lexingtor." "Trapped, bagged, indeed!" said Morgan. "I'll show them who's bagged."                 - The July sun poured dQwn'his hot, scorching rays on the mov- ing column, as it dashed along the dusty limestone road. The springs and streams were dry, and not a drop of water could be obtained for man or horse, after leaving Elkhorn creek at George- town. It was just past noon when the wearied and dust-covered col- umn of almost famished men were ordered to halt, three miles from Cynthiana. The scouts that had been sent forward to as- certain the position of affairs at that place, returned; bringing the intelligence that a large force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery was well posted in the town for its defence. 'a Call Major Gano," ordered Colonel Morgan. 'Major," said he to that officer, who promptly appeared in response to the call, L "take your Texas squadron and make your way round so as to enter the town from the right; and you, Colonel Harper, with   J your regiment of Georgians, cross the river and get into the rear. Lieutenant Harrison, you, with your artillery, accompany me.  The attack will be made by me in front in half an hour." The Texas and Georgia regiments dashed off to take the posi-  tions assigned them. Colonel Morgan, at the head of his men, moved down the pike.  When within half a mile of the town, orders were given for four   OF MORGAN AND HsS MEN.       29 hundred men to dismount and secure their horses in a woodland to the right. The others were to remain mounted, and dash upon the cavalry of the enemy, his infantry being in most excellent position, just outside the town, protected by a stone fence. The engagement conlmenced by the firing of a volley from the enemy, upon the advancing column. This was quickly responded to by Harrison's battery. "Forward !" rang out, and the men, inspired by their leader's presence and daring, rushed on the concealed foe. The Federal cavalry were soon driven back before the impetuous onset of the Confederates. But the infantry, protected by the stone fence, held- their position, and continued to pour volley after volley into the advancing ranks.- Here and there fell one and another, killed or wounded. But the moving force pressed steadily on. ' Showers of bullets cut the air and sped 6n their work of death.  The loud and rapid dis- charge of artillery stunned the edr with  deafening roar. For an hour the contest raged with the wildest fierceness on both sides. The Federals knowing their advantage in position, and stimuIated by the cheering words of their commanders, were determined not to yield. But they could no longer withstand the impetuous charges of Morgan's men, who fought with more than their wdnted despera- tion, and finally they began to retreat. They fell slowly back, taking advantage of every fence and house, to shelter themselves, and fire upon their pursuers. There was a stone wall within the surburbs of the town, behind which a squad of men had taken cover, and from this protected point they poured into the Confed- erate ranks a sharp and destructive fire. Thley ould be dislodged only by a   direct charge upon thir position.  Private   Moore, of Louisianae heading a  company   of twenty-five men, rushed upon it in face of a rapid fire of musketry, and, leaping the fence, routed the enemy, who   fled in wild confusion, throwing aside guns and haversacks in their precipitate flight. The Home Guard. made a sudden rush for the Court-house, but this movement had been anticipated, and a  detachment of Confederate cavalry swept round and cut off   their retreat. The regulars were hemmed in between Morgan in front and Gane on the right, while the Georgians moved, up in the rear. Thus  com- pletely surrounded, they  saw nothing before them  but a  hand to hand fight. Suddenly white handkerchiefs    were observed streaming from   220        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  the points of many bayonets, and waving from windows. The battle was over. Tne vanquished enemy had surrendered.  Four hundred and twenty persons were soon paraded in front of the Court-house'for parole, among whom were seventy Home Guards. Colonel Morgan, while crossing the street, had his attention ar- rested by a little girl who ran wildly along shrieking with fright. He caught the child in his arms, and asked her what was the matter. She laid her little bare head on his shoulder, and sobbed wildly. He smoothed her tangled hair, patted her stained cheeks, and with soothing voice endeavored to assuage her grief. It was several moments before she could speak. "Oh, my father-my dear father! They have got him! I will never see 1im no more!"And the little, trembling creature burst into a fresh paroxysm of tears. "Where is your father, my child?" asked the colonel, in a soft tone, at the same time continuing his caresses. "The Secesh has got him, sir. They'll put him in the big prison. Aunt Nancy told me so." "And where is your mother, my child?" "I haven't got no mother, sir. She's went up to heaven, when I was a little baby." Colonel Morgan felt the tears rush to his eyes. He thought of his own little girl and her mother now in heaven. He understood the whole case, and bearing the child in his arms, he moved into the midst of the prisoners. "Whose child is this?" asked the colonel. "Is her father here?" A man-one of the Home Guards-rushed forward. "It is my child, colonel. Thank you-thanlk you for your kindness," said the grateful father, as the tearsj streamed down his face.  It was an affecting incident-such a one as sometimes occurs to relieve the horrors of dread-visaged war. And none of those who witnessed it were ever known to call Colonel Morgan harsh names after that.  The men were speedily paroled and sent under an escort to Fal- mouth, where they took cars for Cincinnati. Colonel Morgan found himself possessor of a fine 12-pounder brass piece of artillery, a large number of small-arms, a great supply of commissary and medical stores, tents, ammunition, and about three hundred gov-   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        221 ernment horses. The horses-such as were deemed fit-were se- lected by the men; the stores of all kinds, together with the arn- munition, were destroyed. The command rested in Cynthiana for the night, ready to set out on their victorious march at an early hour on the following morning.      222        RAIDS- AND ROMANCE  CHAPTER XLI.  PARIS, RICHMOND, CRAB ORCHARD, SOMERSET. -THE alarm and uncertainty which pervaded the Federal forces in central Kentucky at the brilliant exploits of Colonel Morgan, and the rapidity of his movements, can scarcely be conceived. Lexington and Paris both threatened, Cynthiana taken, no one could decide which would be the next point of attack. Lexington called upon Paris for reinforcements-Paris, in reply, demanded succor of Lexington. But the condition of the latter city became so hazardous, menaced as it was from the direction of Georgetown nd Richmond, that it was finally decided to concentrate the troops within its limits for its defence.' Accordingly, the forces were ordered from Paris to Lexington, leaving the former town wholly at the mercy of the advancing foe. On the 19th of July, the day following the capture of Cynthiana, Colonel Morgan moved upon Paris, now entirely undefended. When within a few miles of the city; he met a flag of truce, ten- dering him the peaceful and quiet possession of the place, and when he entered tihe streets, cheers and welcomes rang out on the air. Remaining here through the night, Colonel Morgan under- stood, through his scouts, that very nearly the entire force from Lexington was being moved upon Paris, for the purpose of attack- ing him. Not desiring an engagement, when it could be avoided, Colonel Morgan determined to fall back upon Richmond, prepara- tory to leaving the State. Accordingly, orders were issued to the men to be ready to march early thq following morning. Mean- while, pickets kept watch, lest at any time they should be sur- prised. - As the Confederates were setting out the next day towards Richmond, they discovered the Federals moving towards the town from Lexington. Colonel Morgan called a halt, and, by a little manceuvring, so scared the Yankees, who supposed he intended to flank them, that they wheeled about and made a quick retreat. Thus relieved of their presence, ColoneI Morgan was enabled- to bring off all his guns and stores without molestation or detriment.   OF MORGAN   AND HS MEN.      223 The only loss sustained was that of one picket, who, it was sup- posed, was surprised and captured by the enemy in their advance. Froim Paris the Confederate force marched to Richmond. Here the warmest enthusiasm greeted them on all sides. Their passage throughl the town to their encampment beyond, was a grand ova- tion each individual vieing with his neighbor in his endeavors to manifest his delight and approbation. Ladies showered bouquets and waved handkerchiefs-children waved handkerchietfs and smiled-men, old and young, smiled, and bowed, and hurrahed. Ample provision was made for a luxurious repast for the whole command, who partook of the kindly cheef  righlt good zest, their appetites being well developed by their long and weary ride. Several recruits joined them here, who were furnished with arms and mounted. It had been Colonel Morgan's intention to remain in Richmond several days, thereby giving an opportunity for the enrolment of many who were desirous to enlist under his standard, but being informed that a large cavalry force had been sent out by way of Danville to intercept and cut off his retreat, he determined to thwart their plans by pushing forward to Crab Orchard, which point lie reached the 22d July, at daybreak. There he found about one hundred and twenty wagons and about one million dollars' worth of stores, all of which was given. into the hands of his men to be destroyed, as it was impossible to remove any thng over that rugged, broken country. ' The boys gave themselves to the work of burning and breaking with great zest, and soon the gigantic task was accomplished and the whole column  again on the advance towards Somerset, which was reached at sundown of the same day. This point was the depot of the Federal army at Cumberland Gap, and contained large " stores. Colonel Morgan, feeling entire safety, took possession of the telegraph office, and countermanded every order of General Boyle with regard to the movement of the troops still in pursuit of him.. There another million dollars worth of Federal property was destroyed, and a thousand stand of arnms recaptured that had been taken from General Zollicoffer's forces at the memorable and disastrous engagement at Fishing Creek. Having here rested his troops, Colonel Morgan moved forward to Sparta, which point he reached July 24th, having been absent on his expedition just twenty days, during which time he "cap- tured (and paroled) over twelve hundred prisoners, seven thou- sand stand of arms, one gun, and destroyed, at lowest computa- 1 l]     224       RBAIDS AND ROMANCE tion seven and a half million dollars' worth of stores, arms, and subsistence, besides hospital buildings, bridges and other property. Besides this, with the loss of only ninety men, he dispersed over seventeen hundred Hrome Guards, captured seventeen towns, in which he destroyed war material, and marched above one thou- sand miles, and recruited his force of eight hundred and seventy. men to twelve hundred." After Colonel Morgan's return from Kentucly into Tennessee, the latter part of July, he removed his headquarters to Hartsville, a small town on the north bank of the Cumberland, some twelve or fifteen miles from Gallatin, in a direct line, but much further than this by the river.  There was a Federal force, mostly Kentuckians, in possession of Gallatin, commanded by Colonel Bruce. Colonel Morgan deter- mined to capture the town, Yankees a]ad all, and to this end he sent a force under Captain Desha to execute his purpose. Tlis was on the morning of the 12th of August. The detachment was accompanied by George 'A. Ellsworth, telegraph operator, who had, on so many occasions, rendered Colonel Morgan valuable assistance while in Kentucky. The morning was beautifully bright; the sun had scarcely risen when the party found them- selves within two miles of the town. Dashing forward so as to catch the Federal colonel unawares, the Confederates were de- manding the surrender of the place before the Yankees knew aught of their unwelcome presence in their vicinity. The move- ment was comme il faut. The Federals were completely sur- prised. No resistance whatever was offered, but surrender came as if it had been a premeditated thing. The men, with their col- ,onel, were paroled by Captain Desha. When, however, the paroled colonel and his men reached Louisville, a few days after- wards, they were arrested on the charge of cowardice, an sent torward to Camp Chase for imprisonment. Colonel Bruce was severely reprimanded for yielding his corn u   ,and into the hands of the enemy without a struggle; b lt he argued that r sistance, under the circumstances, was wholly use- ]ess. They were surrounded by the Confederates without a mo- ment's warni g. His men wer-e not under arms, there was no organization, nor could any be effected before the rebels were upon them.               ! While Captain Desha, assisted by Captain McCann, of the Cheatham Rifles, was scaring the Yankee Kentuckians out of all sense of propriety by marching upon them, sans ceremonie and !   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        225 claiming them as prisoners, Mr. Ellsworth was playing his part of the game by annoying the enemy with dispatches. Dashing into Gallatin, on his fine, chestnut sorrel steed, booted and spurred like any other brave Knight of the Southern Cross, he rode quickly up to the principal hotel and inquired, in quite a peremptory tone, for the telegraph office. "At the depot, sir," replied the .waiter of the public house, looking at him in blank astonishment. Ellsworth hesitated no further, Spurring his horse, he galloped off at full dash to the depot. Alighting, hurriedly, and throwing the rein over his horse's head, he burst open the door, and sprung up stairs to the bedroom of the sleeping operator, who, aroused by the dreadful noise, looked up from his bed to see-oh- horror!-a " rebel" standing over him with a six-shooter presented at his head. Pale with affright at this most fearful apparition, he sat stark upright in the bed. Co(ild it be so? He rubbed his eyes and gazed wildly up. There it stood. Was it ghost or de'il, or what was tenfold worse than either-an avenging rebel? His hair stood on end. His eyes stared fearfully from their sockets; his lips were pale and motionless; he trembled from head to foot, like one suddenly seized with a strong ague. "Why are you so scared, man?" said Ellsworth to him. "I do not want your life-behave yourself, and you have nothing to fear. Resist, and you are a dead man. Dress yourself and come with me; Colonel Morgan needs your services in the room below." i The poor affrighted operator, somewhat reassured, sprung from his bed at the word of command, and hastily donned his apparel. As he gave the lest few hurried strokes to his hair, Ellsworth, impatieht of waiting, turned upon him and said: ";Now, follow me, sir, to the room below." The man seized his hat and obeyed the command with alacrity. "Now, show me all your signals. Mind, no cheat. I will not be imposed on," said Ellsworth sternly, as the two reached the room and stood beside the desk.  Had the operator thought for a moment'of deception, the blood- thirsty look 6f the huge revolver which Ellsworth still held in his hand, would have dissipated any such intention in a moment. "Now, let me test the line to Nashville and Louisville." The Yankee, with a gracious smile, stepped aside. "O. K.," said Ellsworthl; what is your earliest office hour?" "Seven-thirty minutes, sir," responded the operator, bowing obsequiously. 10*      226        RIDS AND ROMANCE "And it is now just five," said Ellsworth, taking out his watch and looking at the time;!" two hours and a half before I can begin my work." Ellsworth ordered breakfast for himself and prisoner, and the two sat down side by side to the steaming coffee and smoking rolls as if they had always been the veriest cronies. "Seven o'clock! we must to our work, sir!" and Ellsworth es- corted his new-found friend from the breakfast-table back to the office. Placing Mr. Brooks outside the office under guard, Ellsworth entered and took possession, feeling that he sufficiently understood matters to communicate with any point.  The signal was given at seven and ten minutes. It was from the depot office in Nashville. "Train left here for Louisville on time." Another signal, and the operator at Franklin, Kentucky, informed Gallatin that the train had left on time for the South.  Ellsworth stepped to the door. "Tell Captain McCann I wish to see him at this place irnmedi- ately," he said to a Confederate soldier who was standing near. In a few minutes the captain rushed into the room. "Any trouble, Ellsworth           I " "The train from Franklin will be due, captain, in a very littlh while. Had you not as well p arpare to take charge of her?" "Certainly, certainly, Ellsworth. I will do so with pleasure ;"  and the captain dashed'out, called together his men, and posted them in proper position for the proposed business. Soon the train came steaming on, all unconscious of danger. She had scarcely reached the water-tank, just outside the town, when the Confederates very politely made known their desire to take her in charge.  This was readily assented to by the engineer and conductor, who saw that resistance or escape was not for a moment to be thought of.  The train from Nashville was due, but there were no indications yet of her arrival. Ellsworth, seating himself, asked of the Nashville operator: Train No. 6 not yet arrived. What can be the trouble with her?" The reply soon came. "Guess Morgan's got her; she left on time with twenty-four cars, six loaded." Bowling Green called Gallatin. "Where is the Nashville train? i Heard any thing from her?" !    OF MORGAN AND "IS MEN.        227 Not yet arrived," responded Ellsworth.  Bowling Green then called Nashville. "Gallatin says No. not yet arrived; have you heard firon it?" Nashville, in reply, said: "No; they left on time." Bowling Green, quite perturbed and beginning to suspect foul play, called to Nashville: "Any rumors of the enemy between Nashville and Gallatin?" "Nary rumor!" was the laconic answer. Gallatin was then informed by Nashville that the passenger train had left on time, bound North. Inquiry after inquiry was made of Gallatin with regard to the two trains, both by Nashville and Bowling Green. The ivariable response of Gallatin was, "Not yet arrived." Eleven o'clock came. Nashville, as if aroused by some sudden fury, began to call on Gallatin with great earnestness. Ellsworth suspected the cause. The cars, having obtained in- formation of the occupancy of Gallatin by the Confederates, I ad suddenly put back to Nashville and given the alarm. Questi ns were asked which Ellsworth did not dare to answer, for fear of betrayal.  He stepped to the door an invited in the Feeral oprator, Mr. Brooks. "Now, sil," said Ellsworth to him, "I want you to answer     C I Nashville in the most satisfactory manner. I shall listen to your  re!lies, and if there is any thing wrong, it will have to be atoned  I fo' by a life during the war in a Dixie prison." "All shall be right, sir," responded the accommodating opera- tor,. glad to be at his old work again. Nashville, with suspicions highly aroused, called to Gallatin: What was the name of that young lady you accompanied to Major Foster's?" "Be careful," enjoined Ellsworth, leaning over the shoulder of  the operator. "Give a correct reply!"                 i "I don't remember of -going to Major Foster's with any yourg lady," was the response. "Whlat about that nitric acid I sent you the other day?" asked Nashville. "You sent me no nitric acid." "Is that correct?" and Ellsworth eyed the operator sternly. I "Correct, sir." Nashville, yet suspicious: ' Mr. Marshall, the Superintendent of Railroads, is not yet satisfied that you are not Morgan's operator, * '             '               0'f1     228        RAIDS AND ROMANCE 1nd wishes you to tell him who you desired to take your place while you were gone on leave of absence, how long you wished to be gone, and where did you wish to go?' Gallatin responded: "Tell Mr. Marshall that I wished Mr. Clay- ton to take my place, while I got a week's leave to go to Cincin- nati." Nashville was convinced, and soon there came over the wires the following order:  "To MURPHY, Conductor, Gallatin  "You will run to Edgefield Junction to meet and pass trains Nos. 4 and 6, and pass them both at that point. /Answer how' you understand.             B. MARSHALL." The answer was promptly returned, that the instructions would be obeyed. Nashville informed Ellsworth that "trains Nos. 4 and 6 had left again at eleven fifteen minutes." About four o'clock in the afternoon, Nashville again called lusti- ly on Gallatin: "Trains Nos. 4 and 6 are back again the second  time. We have positive information that the enemy is in posses- sion of Gallatin. Where is Murphy?" It was unnecessary to practise the deception further. The cars would not come. At five o'clock, Ellsworth sent the following to George D. Pren- tice: "GALLATIN, Aug. 12, 1862. "GEORGE D. PRENTICE, LOUISVILLE, KY.: "Your prediction, in yesterday's paper, regarding my where- abouts, is like most of the items from your pen. You had better go to Jeffersonville to sleep to-night. "JOHN H. MORGAN, /  Commanding Brigade." A lady, beautiful and. sprightly, accompanied by Captain Mc- Cann, and two other ladies, made her appearance in the office, and was introduced to Mr. Ellsworth. "Will you, Mr. Ellsworth, send a message to Prentice for me?" she said, laughing. "Assuredly I will, with pleasure." She turned to the desk, and hurriedly wrote her dispatch:   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        229 "GALLATIN, Aug. 12, 1862. "GEORGE D. PRENTICE, LOUISVILLE, KY.: "Your friend, Colonel John H.

Morgan, whom you published in your paper some time ago, when he was in Knoxville, accompanies his cousin John, with four hundred Indians. He seeks no scalp but yours. "A SEOESH LADY." Mr. Brooks, who was now released from his military position, as prisoner, joined in the conversation of the merry party, with as much zest as any one. He seemed to enjoy highly the whole day's proceedings, and even jested over his morning fright. The party repaired to the house of the lady, where, with the assembled fair of the good town of Gallatin, the heroes of the day passed the evening with song and dance, and the graphic recital of thrilling adventure. Every manifestation of joy that the citi- zens of Gallatin could give at their release from Yankee thraldom, was displayed by all classes. Captains Desha and McCann, and their men, were welcomed to the best cheer the town could offer-were feted and toasted-and smiled upon by bright eyes, until they were made to appreciate, in some degree, at least, the great favor they had bestowed on the grateful inhabitants.     230        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER XLI. GALLATIN-ITS REVERSES. THE great joy of the good people of Gallatin at being relieved from Federal domination, by the brilliant and successful attack of the Southrons, under Captains Desha and McCann, was soon turn- ed to mourning, by the sudden reoccupation of the town by the enemy. Nashville was aroused when she heard that Boone and his men had been seized upon by the Confederates, and the Yankees were determined [to be avenged for the loss, by repossessing Gallatin, capturing the hated Morgan and his men, if possible to do so, and, in the event of failure in this object, to wreak vengeance on the defenceless inhabitants of the town and country. Accordingly, an Indiana regiment, headed by one Colonel Hef- feren, set out from Nashville to avenge the dignity of the Federal arms on the audacious rebels, who had dared to molest them in their fancied security. The Federals proceeded to Gallatin, but found no Confederates upon whom to be revenged. But their insatiable cruelty must be gratified, and with that fiendishness characteristic of the Yankee soldier, they sought out the aged and peaceful citizens, and drag- ged them from their homes, to incarcerate them in their wretched dungeons. From house to house these armed wretches proceeded, bursting open doors, rushing from room to room, using the most revolting languages to unprotected females, dragging forth, with abuse and cruelty, old men whose only crime was daring to oppose such inhuman proceedings, and a government that would sanction and support them. Store doors were forced by this lawless mob, Idressed in the uniform of United States soldiers; the owners were seized and placed under guard, and all their goods either appropriated or wantonly destroyed. A squad of fifteen of these armed ruffians, with demoniac yells and imprecations, rushed upon the Masonic Lodge, drove in the door, and with the fury of madmen, upset   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         231 and broke chairs, tables, desks, dashed the fragments about the room, threw the Bible from the window, dragged forth the para- phernalia of the order, ahd scattered it wildly about the street. The astonished citizens stood aghast in mute horror as this fearful work of destruction progressed, not daring to offer even a word of protest against the brutal outrage. Private property shared the same fate, and those who were knowj to the despera- does as Southern men and women, had to behold in silent despair their houses sacked, their valuables destroyed before their eyes, or taken off by the despoilers. The work of lawless plunder ended, the unholy rioters set out to return to Nashville, carrying with them forty of the best citi- zens of the place. They proceeded on foot as far as Sandersville, at which place Colonel Morgan's men had burnt the railroad bridge, only a few days before. They had not advanced many miles on their way before Colo- nel Morgan, with twelve hundred men, appeared in the streets of Gallatin. His arrival was greeted with the joyous tears of the grateful citizens, who hailed him as the deliverer of their hus- bands, sons, and brothers. He needed not to be importuned to pursue the dastardly foe. Gaining a few points of, information, he dashed out after him. He had not gone far before he overtook the retreating column, who, instead of giving battle, fled precipitately in the direction of Nash- ville. The Confederates pursued the fleeing Indianians, killing about sixty and taking a large number prisoners. On they dashed, as if for dear life, the victorious troops driving them everywhere before them with dreadful carnage. At last, the remnant of the fugitives, breathless with affright, threw them- selves behind a triangular stockade at the junction of the rail- roads, and here made a stand. The Confederates made a charge upon the ranks, but it was a strong position, and the few Yankees sheltered behind the walls would not repay for the trouble, so the colonel withdrew and retraced his way to Gallatin, bearing with him the released citizens, who had been rescued from a doom worse than death. The women rushed into the streets, wild with joy, as they saw the conquerors advance, bringing with them their husbands and sons.; They clasped their benefactors in their arnt thanked them with streaming faces, and invoked the blessing of Heavell on them i                    A     232        RAIDS AND ROMANCE in all their undertakings. Never was there amore affecting scene, and never before had Colonel Morgan and his men felt so grateful for triumph over the foe. Officers and men were alike welcomed into every house, where repasts were prepared for them with a lavishness that fully be- s8Poke the gratitude of generous hearts. The young ladies played and sang for the gallant heroes who- had restored to them their fathers and brothers. A late hour in the night found the festivity  and joy unabated. Early the next morning Colonel Morgan was informed that a large Federal cavalry force, led by R. R. Johnston, formerly a * lawyer of Paducah, Kentucky, who had been sent out for the express object of capturing himl and his command, was rapidly /marching on Gallatin. With his wonted quickness Colonel Morgan rallied his forces, land set out on the Hartsville road to encounter his sanguine pur- isuers.             l l With him were Major Dnke, Colonel St. G(renfel, Major Gano, !Captains Desha, McCann, Hamilton, Castleman, Harrison, etc., all of them tried men, whose courage and daring were everywhere [known and acknowledged. The force of the enemy was reported as very heavy, well armed and equipped.     ,  N othing daunted by those rumors of superiority the brave Southrons shouldered their guns, and, mounting their steeds, rushed out to the conflict. They had proceeded but a mile when the cry ran through the ?anks, "' The Yankees! the Yankees!"                Instantly orders were given to halt and prepare for an engage- ment. Colonel Morgan formed his men as rapidly anrd as well as he could, and opened upon the advancing foe a heavy volley of musketry. The attack was furious; the Yankees replied in a man- ner which told their determination to fight. - Again and again, in rapid succession, were the Federal ranks as- sailed by a stunning shower of Minnie balls and bullets, while the men advanced nearer and nearer towards the serried ranks of the enemy. The sharp, quick fire of the guns, mingling with the low ass of the trampling horsemen, filled- the air with strange, wild sounds. "They are determined to give us close quarters," observed Col. Morgan to Major Duke at his side. "See, they are advancing apidly upon us!" "But see, colonel," said Duke, " they bring a flag of truce; they   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         233 will surrender. Cowards!" added Duke, scowling, "lthus to yield  ^ without a fight." "They surely will not do that," rejoined Morgan, keeping his eye steadily fixed upon the approaching squad, who bore down upon them at a pretty lively pace. ' They would brand themselves with infamy forever to pursue such a course." The firing ceased as soon as the flag had been observed, and the column, all ready for a renewal of the engagement, stood awaiting the issue of the parley. Colonel Morgan received the deputation with his usual dignity and grace. The note was presented, bearing the signature of the Federal colonel. It was a request for an armistice of several hours. John- ston stated that he was surprised; hadn't his men together and was not prepared for battle. Colonel Morgan read the missive. "Tell your colonel," said he to the Yankee adjutant, "that he has been pursuing me from point to point, eager for a fight. I am now ready, and he can have it. If he can defeat me, very well." The officer dashed back to his colonel with the pithy reply, and i in a few minutes hostilities were resumed. \  The IConfederates, like men in earnest, pressed upon the foe, sending at every step a hail-storm of bullets into his irresolute ranks. The Federals made but a feeble reply. Onward drove the inspirited men-onward, onward to glorious victory. Again appeared the truce flag. Johnston had surrendered! Loud and long rose the shout from the joyous hosts of the victors. The air was rent with their wild acclamations. The Federals were surrounded and compelled to lay down their arns. Colonel Johnston, with six hundred of his men, were made prisoners. The remainder fled to the Cumberland. Believing themselves pursued, they had cast aside every thing that might re- tard their flight, and actuated-by that strongest law of our nature, "self-preservation," had betaken themselves to the river by the shortest available route, thinking if they could but place that stream between them and the pursuing hosts, they had nothing to fear. On reaching the bank of the Cumberland, many deserted -their horses and dashed into the stream to swim to the opposite shore. They were bootless, hatless, gunless, horseless-a parcel of poor affrighted men, running away as best they could, fromnthe 4 dreaded Morgan anld his dare-devil creW." * * I     234       -RAIDS AND ROMANCE Finding themselves On the south bank of the stream withl their horses on the wrong side, unable to walk to Nashville, they fell to work to press into service every horse, mule, and vehicle they could find. And it was a rich, rare spectacle to see the motley cavalcade under whip and spur, bound in hot haste for that city of safety. "What's the matter friends?" asked a traveller, as he jencoun- tered them outside of Lebanon, driving on as fast as circumstances would allow towards Nashville. "Done for--done for," was the response of a little red-haired man, who sat astride a mule, on which there was not even so much as a blanket; "Morgan has cut us all to pieces, taken our colonel and all his men, and we only are left to tell the tale." "Too bad, my friend! Has Morgan whipped us again? But where did this occur?" interrogated the delighted Southlerner, pre- serving a grave mlien and solemn tone. "At Gallatin!" responded half a dozen voices, as if eager to proclaim their defeat. "Who commanded you, and how many strong?" "We were under Colonel Johnston, and numbered eleven hun- dred." "And did that desperado Morgan whip you wfth his handful of ragamuffins?" "I Oh! he had thousands--the earth was perfectly covered with his men. He did whip us, and I believe he can do it again. These Slecesh seem to have the devil in them. They fight like the old scratch himself!" "Bad-bad!" exclaimed the traveller. "Something must be done to put ts fellow Morgan out of thie way." "Can't catch him; he's here, and there, and everywhere. We were after him for days, and then met him where we didn't expect to find him. You can't head him; it's no use trying!" The traveller bowed and rode on. As he passed along the col- umn, he asked several more the same question. All gave a like X  response, "Morgan had used them up!" Colonel Morgan again returned in triumph to Gallatin, bearing with him his long line of prisoners. The remainder of the day was occupied in giving them paroles. The next day Morgan and his men, followed by the blessings and prayers of the whole population of the little town, left Gallatin for earnest work else- where. But a few weeks elapsed, before the Yankees were again the   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         235 masters of the place, exceeding, if possible, their former cruelty and coarseness.

AFTER the brilliant victory at Gallatin, the COofederates retired to their headquarters near Hartsville, to wait another favorable op- portunity to pounce upon the Yankees. The defeat of Johnston had served to greatly heighten their fear of the invincible and ubiquitous Morgan, teaching them an increased degree of caution, which they evidenced by prudently keeping close to their base of operations. Now and then, an ill-omened squad, venturing out too far, was caught up by the vigilant Southrons and placed be- yond the pale of further mischief. It was a time of activity with the Confederate army in Tennes- see. Bragg was busily engaged in preparations to move into Ken- tucky. Buell, understanding his designs, and desiring to thwart them, was slowly falling back froln Deckherd. General Kirby Smith was advancing into Kentucky through Pound Gap, with an army destined to occupy the central portion of the State, and there act in conjunction with General Bragg, whose proposed rou;e was through Glasgow, Mumfordsville, and Bardstown. Colonel Morgan, with a portion of his force, dashed once more into Glasgow, arrested the provost-marshal of the place, and is$ued a proclamation, in which he told Union men of the punishment with which they were to be visited for their cruel treatment to his friends. Then returning into Tennessee, he consummated his arrange- ments to accompany Bragg on his proposed expedition. "Welare going into Kentucky again, boys," said Lawrence, as the mess sat around the table one morning. soon after the return from Glasgow, " and we go this time to stay." "Three cheers for old Kentucky!" huzzahed a half dozen voices. ' Three cheers for the noble old State; may we win her from Yan- kee-rule!"                 i "Come, Charley, what are you doing there, moping in that cor- ner?" said young Brent to our hero, as he lay stretched out on his straw pallet, on one side of the tent. t"Come, don't you see break-,   OF MORGA:N ED HS MEN.        237 fast is ready? and didn't you hear that glorious news? We are going back to old Kentucky to stay. Why, Charley, I should think you would jump over the table at that glorious announce- ment!"            i         "' I am delighted, Brent, at the news, but my head ches so mis- erably, I don't believe I could sit up. John, are you sure this is true? Where did you get your information?" "From headquarters, Charley. It's as true as the Bible, and no mistake. Major Duke told Cal. Morgan, and I had it from Cal. himself just a few minutes ago. Come, Charley, get up, boy, and drink this cup of coffee. It's some of my own make, and it is most excellent-isn't it, boys?"  "First-rate! first-rate, Johnl" answered all present. "Good enough to make a sick man well." "Here, Charley, drink this," said Brent, as he moved from the table to the side of the straw pallet with a tin cup of smoking cof- fee in his hand. "Drink it, and if it doesn't cure your head in ten minutes, I am no doctor." "Charley raised himself up on his elbow, and taking the cup from the soldier's hand, pipped a few drops, and handed it back to his friend. "Pshaw, Charley, you haven't taken any. You must drink it all. Two sips won't cure you! I do believe, boys," said Brent, turning to the mess, "that Charley has the heartache! Have you been hearing any bad news from Kentucky lately? Come, make i a good confession. Here, let me feel your pulse. Pshaw! just as slow and steady 8s an old clock. Not a bit of fever. Now put out your tongue, Charley. I must examine you thoroughly, and ; find out your symptoms, before I can prescribe." Charley, smiling, obeyed the bidding, and turning his face full to the light, thrust out his tongue for Brent's inspection. i Why, your tongue is a little coated, old fellow--but not much. i A good cup of coffee, and you will be well by dinner. No time to get sick now; we may be off to Kentucky in less than twelve hours. When did you say we were to set out, John?" "In a few days,. less than a week, I understand. But it may be to-morrow. You know Colonel Morgan gives us but short notice." "Here, Ollarley, you must indeed take this coffee,--notling like At for headache and heartache; indeed, it will cure all kinds of aches. Drink it down, and think of the Kentucky girls, and, my word for it, you will be well in two hours." "No doubt of it, Charley," said John.    I     238        RAIDS AND RO[AISCE "But, here," said Brent, 'let me pour you another cup. That's child." "Don't put any sugar in it, John; I am sick at my stomach, and can't bear any thing sweet." The fresh coffee was handed, and Charley drank it down, wear- ing all the while a martyr look. "Now, be still a little while," said young Brent, feeling his pulse a second time with mnock gravity, " and by dinner you may be up and preparing for your trip to Louisville.'" Breakfast being over, young Brent took it upon himself to clear away the table and arrange things generally. He could do this, he said, and at the same time attend to his patient. The other boys went out to learn the news of the day. They had not been gone more than half an hour, before John rushed back to the tent, his countenance bright with joy, exclaim- ing: "News from home, Charley-a letter, a letter! Come, my boy, this will make you well, and no mistake." Young Brent, who sat, beside the open tent, motioned to, him to be silent. "What's the matter, Brent?" inquired John, anxiously, as he rea ched his side and saw his grave expression of countenance. "Be still--Charley is asleep, and is really quite sick." "Oh, I hope not, Brent-nothing more than a nervous head- ache, I judge. You know he has done a great deal of hard work recently. No one fought more bravely at Gallatin than did he, and he has been kept quite busy since we came into camp." "It may pass off without serious consequences, but I feel anx- ious. He has a very high fever. Here, look how red his face is, and he complains of severe pain in his side." John approached the bedside, and stooped down to look at his friend.  The sleeper's lips moved-"Water, water!" he muttered. "What will you have, Charley?" asked John, bending tenderly over him, and speaking as softly as a woman. The sound of his voice aroused the sleeper, who, starting, opened his eyes and looked wildly up. "What did you say, Charley?" repeated John. "Is there any thing you want?" "i I didn't say any thing, did I? I must have been dreaming. But I am intolerably thirsty. Can I have some water, Doctor Brent?" he said, casting a mischievous glance into that person- age's face.                 t   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         239 Young Brent hastened to procure him a cup of fresh water. "Charley, what for a letter from old Kentucky?" asked John, quizzically. "Oh, have you a letter, John?"And Charley sprang up in bed and gazed beseechingly on his friend. "Is it from Louisville? But you haven't got one, John," he added, despondingly. "Why did you tantalize me so?" and he fell back upon his pallet with a sigh. "Oh, my head!" he exclaimed, a moment after, pressing his hands on his temples. "It aches to bursting." "I am sorry I excited you so, Charley; but here is a letter for you, and it is from Louisville, too."         I Charley stretched forth his hand eagerly, and grasped the ex- tended missive. "Fromrn  Lu-my dear, dear sister. But how did you get it, John?" "A man came through direct from Louisville-young Mayneir. He brought a large lot of letters for our men."  "Did you get one from home, John?" inquired Charley, most earnestly. "Yes; from Mary-a sweet, loving letter as ever a brother re- ceived. You shall read it, Charley, when you get through with yours. You will see Mary has not forgotten you. She mentions your name in every line. And she says, too, as you will see, that she has written you a long letter to be sent out with this. Per- haps it has not yet been distributed." "Where is Mayner now, John? Do tell him to come here im- mediately, if you please." "He is somewhere in camp. I will go directly and bring him here. But let's read our letters first." "Here is a good, cool drink .of water, Charley; I ran all the way from the spring," and Brent put the cup to his fevered lips. tHe swallowed the draught eagerly.     . "I must bathe your head, Charley." "Oh, wait, Brent, until I read my letter from home," and Char- ley hastily tore off the envelope. As he opened the letter, a neat- ly folded sheet of note paper, closely written, fell Out. He took it up and examined the signature. As his eyes rested upon it his face flushed crimson. "Ah, Charley will have no further need of my services now, John. That billet-doux will prove a sovereign panacea. Head-i ache and heartache will now be cured. I'll leave you to your happiness, my most happy patient, and go and see if I can't hear     240        RAIDS AND ROMANCE of a letter for myself. Surely some friend has remembered me." Brent stepped outside the tent, leaving Charley to peruse his sheet uninterrupted by his presence. John sat down beside the straw pallet, and the two read and re-read their letters, and talked of the dear friepds at home, whom ,they hoped so soon to see, until Charley forgot his headache in the joy of glad thoughts and bright anticipations. ' How pleasant it would be, John, if we could but get to ILouis- ville in time for Lu's marriage! It is strange Spalding told me nothing of this, when we met at Lebanon; but then I left so ab- ruptly, and doubtless he had deferred it till morning. And Mary, too, she ought th have known of it." "She told me, Charley,'that for some weeks previous to your sister's visit to Cincinnati-you know Miss Lu was there while we were in Kentucky-they had met only on the street. Lu for some reason had avoided her. May not this account for her want of information?" With sparkling eyes and throbbing brain, Charley read over and over the letters. Great big tears gathered in his eyes and: rolled down his burning cheeks, as he dwelt on the sweet words of love from her who was his heart's idol. ' All well, Charley?" asked John, re-entering, after an absence of several minutes. "Very well," was the reply, while a happy smile lighted up the fevered face of the speaker. "Yes, that's it. How sad for us all that that miserably false report should obtain currency I You know to what I allude, John? It caused me such anguish as I could not describe, and produced that temporary estrangement between Mary and Lu--these two,  who have been as sisters from their childhood."  "Bad, bad-too bad. But it's all passed now, Charley, my boy, and we won't torment ourselves over it longer. You see, the two girls are reconciled, and I should think that you and Mary were friends again. And who knows, Charley, but we may yet be able to accept Miss Lu's invitation? Do you not know, my boy, that we are all going into Kentucky soon I heard it just before I came to you; but, in our joy over the letters, forgot to mention it. Yes, indeed, it's so. We go to stay this time, and, if I mistake not, I shall have the pleasure of attending more than one wed- ding," and John looked so significantly at his friend, that Charley, in spite of himself, blushed red, and betrayed deep embarrassment. ;    OF MORGAN AND HS   EN.      241 "Going into Kentucky! when, John?" and with the excitement of the thought, he sprang from his straw pallet, on whichC he had been sitting during the conversation, and placed himself on a sad- dle that stood near by. "Can it be possible, John, that this is true? Oh, what joy! But, then," and, sighing, he leaned his aching head on his hand, "I may not be well enough to go." "Oh, yes, you will, Charley. Why are you so despondent? All you need is a little rest. You have been overtaxed of late; in- deed, I don't think you have gotten over your trip to Kentucky. Come, now, you must lie down and be still; keep quiet, and you will soon be better. I'll go now and see if I can learn any thing respecting our movement." Charley threw himself on his low bed, in accordance with his friend's desire. But he could not rest. He endeavored to call in his thoughts and compose himself to sleep; but the endeavor was a futile one-his mind would go out to live in the future.

OF MO1IGAN AND HS MEN.       243 Noon came. Charley was no better. His fever had increased, and with it the pain in-his head. The physician was sent for, but he had rode off to a neighboring farm-house, where one of the \men lay ill with fever. Just at night Dr. Lapsley returned to camp. He was immediately called in to see Charley. After thoroughly examining his symptoms, he prescribed medi- cine to be taken at intervals of four hours ithrough the entire night. "What do you think of my case, doctor?" inquired Charley of him, most anxiously, as the physician sat holding his pulse. "I will be well enough to go to Kentucky won't I?" "Oh, I hope so, sir," responded the d t', most encouragingly. "Your fever is pretty high at present. But I think a night's rest and the medicine I have left will greatly restore you. Who will take it upon himself to administer these powders, gentlemen? They must be given regularly." '"I," said John, promptly; "just leave them with me, sir." "You understand directions?" John bowed assent. Next morning found our young friend much better. He had slept well through the night, and the medicine had produced a most happy effect. His head was measurably relieved, the pain from his side gone, and his fever quite abated. He spoke most hopefully of Kentucky, and, with the others of his mess, longed for the moment of departure to come. The doctor called early, pronounced him better, but advised quiet through the day.  At noon, it was announced that the whole comahand must hold itself ready to leave the day after the morrow. Charley joyously set about preparations for the trip. When evening came, he was weary and exhausted, and his fever quite burning. But he was determined to brave it out, and did not mention it to any one. He spent a restless, wakeful night, and the next morning found him unable to rise from his bed. Dr. Lapsley was again called in. He examined him and pro- nounced hiim worse. "Oh, can't I go, doctor?" asked Charley, in a most pleading voice. The doctor hesitated to answer. I must be candid with you, Charley," he said, after some delay. "I think it will be impossi-  ble. I fear you may have a serious attack of fever." Charley turned himself on his low bed, and burst into tears.

I feel I shall not go. I trust you as a friend. I know you will not betray me."           i "Yes, Charley, I will do any thing I can for you." "Here, sit down beside me, and I will tell you all." The young soldier did as he was requested, and Charley told him the story of his love.                    I "I confide my secret to you, Brent, as I would to a. brother. I know you will notJ deceive me. Now get the paper, and let me tell you what to write." ' Brent wiped the tears from his face, and obeying Charley's directions, got paper, pen, and ink. The letter, full of love and devotion, was penned.      j "Tell my friends, Brent, that if I live I will follow the army into Kentucky as soon as I am able." Dr. Lapsley looked in about noon, to order Charley to be moved  to a neighboring house. He had been out and/secured a place for him. ,The ambulance was provided, and stood ready to carry him to his new home. One by one his friends called to bid him good-   by. It was an affecting scene to see th se brave llen, so unused to weep, wipe away the tears from their sun-burned faces, as one after another took leave of their sick comrade. "I will stay with you, Charley," said John. "I feel it my duty. I cannot leave you in this condition." / "Oh! no, John, I cannot ask it of you. .The doctor informs me that the people where I am going have promised to nurse me, and he hirnself will board in the same family. No, no, go on, and may you be permitted to reach Louisville and see again all our dear friends there." John and Brent accompanied Charley, and saw him most conm- fortably situated at farmer Johnson's. "Tell my friends all you know I would say, boys; I #m too weak to talk now," said Charley to them, as they stood o r hin  to bid him farewell. The boys shook his hand affectionately, wishing him a speedy recovery; and dashing away their tears they hastened off to camp.   OF MORGAI   aM  HS MEN.      245 CHAPTER XLIV.     I THE MARRIAGE.

'Just let me try them on you, Lu. There, see how beautiful I Oh! are they not exquisite-perfect? But I see you would rather not wear them to-night; so I'll unclasp them and lay them gently back in their soft bed." l"When woill you wear them, Lu? I am almost dying to see them on you 1" exclaimed Dolly Quitman, as she gazed on the beautiful ornaments. ' Oh, how superb they arel! I never saw - any thing more magnificent. But I agree with you, Lu, in your taste; I am determined when I marry not to wear ornaments, even if they are diamonds themselves." iL Now the queen, and now the gentle girl-bride," said Evange- line, as she undid the clasps and placed the ornaments back in the ecrin, beside which lay two other sets-one of amethyst and pearls, the other a chaste turquoise. 'And there she stood, the " girl-bride,'* as beautiful as. a poet's dream. No ornament needed she to enhance her loveliness. Her black hair parted over her forehead, swept back from the full white temples over the delicate ear, and was gathered into a large roll behind, confined by a comb of consummate workmanship, and her face was partly shaded by the gossamer veil that fell sweeping like fancy frost-work over the chiselled shoulders and full bust until it reached the floor. "And there were roses on her cheeks That came and went like living things." And her lustrous dark eyes beamed bright with the hope and joy of her swelling bosom. Below in the large,- elegant parlors, numerous guests were as- sembled, awaiting in breathless expectation the appearance of the bride and bridegroom-for it is now the hour of ten.

The prayer is ended and congratulations and kisses are showered on the happy pair, wh ose present is perfect happiness, and whose future now wears only the hue of the rose-tint. Ah! well it is that at such moments one dannot look with un- clouded vision adown the- way of life. For there must we behold the grief-the disappointment-the anguish-the parting-the pall -the bier-the narrow house which all must meet, and our hearts, aweary with the contemplation, would sit down in silence and in gloom, heeding not the present good. What wisdom, then, that the veil of uncertainty is thrown before our eyes to shut out the ill that soon must come! It was a joyous company. Ease and genuine hospitality char- acterized every movement of the kind host and hostess; and that freedom from restraint and mutual interchange of thought and feelings, which always distinguish wedding parties from all others, prevailed among the guests. There was but one cloud that threw its shadow over the bright and gladsome scene-it was the thought of the far-away loved ones. Many present had friends in the Southern army. Soon they must be exposed to the shock of battle; for it was fully known that General Bragg had taken up his march into Kentucky; and the husbands, and brothers, and sons who accompanied him, with eyes fixed so strainingly on the old homes, and hearts bent so yearningly towards the loved ones there, might never again sit by the hearth-stone, or hold sweet converse with the cherished friends of yore. Ah, no! but it might be that they would fall in the fierce conflict, and insatiate Death batten on their prostrate forms; and amid the merry laugh and joyous conversation the heart would stand still at the dread picture which the imagination called up. The evening passed pleasantly. The entertainment throughout was marked by the finest taste and the utmost liberality. The table combined elegant profusion and most exquisite grace. The wines were of the finest flavor, the confections of the most choice kinds : while the polite and agreeable manner of Mr. and Mrs. R., served to heighten the pleasure of the whole. On the following morning, attended by numerous friends from the city, they proceeded to Lebanon, where several days were to be passed in festive enjoyments. Mary Lawrence was bonneted, all ready to take her seat in the carriage which was to conyey the bride and groom to the railroad depot, when a note came sum- moning her to her mother's bedside.     248        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER XLV. PARTING OF THE FRIENDS. IT was the early morning. The first rays of the sun, struggling through the thin clouds that lay lazily floating in the east, threw a soft, uncertain light over the earth, which was but just awaken- ing from its deep repose, and early morning birds, decking afresh their soft plumage, began to warble their matinal paeans to Him who feedeth the young sparrows and satisfieth the desires of every living creature. The hand-of autumn was just beginning to touch with mellow dyes the rich foliage of the woodlands. Already her presence had hushed into holy stillness the roystering summer, and filled the soul of nature with calm, contemplative thought. Beside the uncurtained window, Charley lay on his' soft, clean bed, looking out into the gray dawn of the morning. The long, weary hours of the night in Which fitful sleep brought only ghast- ly dreams, were passed at last, and as he caught the first faint beams of the opening day, he hanked God that the dreary night- watches were over. f  ad  ached-oh, so severely; end his' heart sadly-ah, so sadly! Alone-alone! His friends gone -and he in pain and suffering, amid strangers, away, far, far away from home and kindred. No mother to bend over him and soothe his throbbing brain; no father's voice to bid him hope; no sister's gentle hand to smooth his pillow or administer the cooling febri- fuge. ' Alone--alone! Great, scalding tears rushed to his eyes, and chased each other down his face. He endeavored to disengage his mind from these sad contempla- tions, and, turning on his pillow, he strained his gaze through the window, to find, if perchance he might, some object to distract his attention. He saw the uprising sun battling with the slothful clouds, sending his golden glory through the ridgy rifts, and heard the birds sinlg from amid the drooping boughs that came down over his open window, and he thought but the moie of home--for often in his careless boyhood had he looked upon the same morn-   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         249 ing scene, and listened to the sweet songs of early birds. And the tears, a moment before, wiped away, now streamed thick and fast. Just then the loud and ringing shouts of his happy comrades, as they broke up camp and set out on their homeward marci, borne on the morning's breeze, came in through the casement and fell on his ear. He sighed deep. "Gone-gone-to Kentucky!" he sadly murmured to himself. "And I am here alone--left without a friend-perhaps to diet They go to meet with parents and sisters, and mingle with them in joy and gladness amid the haunts of olden times, while I, in sickness and pain, must linger here in a strange land, with strange faces around me, where no one will care for me--and all the kind- ness I shall receive will be bestowed because I am a Southern sol- dier. Hard-hard fate! Oh, the horrors of this dreadful strife! When shall it end, and we be permitted t6return to homes and friends in peace?"?'                - Just then!a gentle rap was heard at his room door. He wiped away his tears, And, assuming as cheerful a tone as he could, re- plied, "Come in."  Supposing it to be one of Mr. Johnson's family, he drew the light spread up so as to conceal his face. i "Good-morning, Charley. How do you do? What, old fellow, here by yourself? Where is Dr. Lapsley? I thought he was go- ing to Icure you immediately, so that you might go into Kentucky. Didn't know but that I might find you well enough to set out with us this morning. Came by to see. Say, my boy, can't you be off? I cannot bear the thought of leaving you behind. How do you feel, anyhow Let me call the doctor; isn't he in the house? Perhaps he  will agree for you to go. I don't know but a ride in the cool morning would do you good. You can rest in the heat of the day. I will stay with you, and we can travel when it is cool. What say you, Charley?" "Oh, John, I wish I could go. But I fear I am too sick. My head aches dreadfully, and I feel feverish and full of pain. But I am tempted to risk it, anyhow. I had just as well die in the effort to return, as to lie here and waste away. I am sure it will kill me to remain after you are all gone. The boys have all left, I suppose?" "Yes; started out but a little while ago. Didn't you hear their shouts? A force left this morning before daylight--an advance. All of our mess, except myself, and I obtained permission to re- main, to come over and see how you did this morning." "'     250        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "I am very glad you did, John," the sick man replied, looking gratefully up into the face of his friend. "I have some little keepsakes I wish you to take home for me. I intended to mention it to you and Brent yesterday, but in the cohfusion of the hour, I entirely forgot it. Look there, John, in that valise, you will find two rings and! a breast-pin. Give the on6 with the three sets in it to my sister; the other, John, with the two hearts, to Mary.

"Oh, well, Charley, I will take them if you wish me to, you know. But there is no need of sending souvenirs home, that I can see. You will get there as soon as we do. We go to open the way for you, and there will be nothing left for you to do but fol- l w on.      '  John stepped to the valise, which stood in the corner of the room, under the stairway, and, unlocking it, drew forth the keep- s kes. "Ntow, John, the hair," said Charley, "You know that is an item of the request." "Well, where will I cut it?" inquired John, assuming a gay air, although he felt as if preparing his friend for the coffin.

"See, here, I have got a big lock; this is enough to give you renown throughout all Louisville. The ornamental hair-makers will have enough to do for weeks to manufacture it into charms, and Pings, and guards, etc., etc. But where will I find the doc- tor, Clarley? I must see him before I go, and it is high time I was off. The Yanks will catch me, if I don't look out pretty sharply." "The doctor is up those stairs, John. I don't think he is out of bed yet." "Well, he must get up and tell me just exactly how you are. That's what I came here for. I wished to know precisely how your case stands. I'll go up and rouse him. It's high tine he was out of bed, anyhow."      \  Without further ceremony John sprang up the stairway, three steps at a time, and, approaching the doctor's bedside, shook him most violently. "I want to know just how Charley is, doctor, before I set out. His friends will be anxious to hear all the particulars. He is awake now." The doctor made a hasty toilet and descended to the sick man's room. He examined him closely, and shook his head. '"I must go, Charley," said John, bending over his bedside. "I hope you will soon be well enough to join us in old Kentucky. Don't gi*V up; you are not very sick. He will be well in a few days; won't he, doctor?" I hope so, in the course of a week or ten days at the most," replied Dr. Lapsley.  "My love to all Kentucky friends, John," said Charley, in a voice, choked with emotion, while his bosom heaved, and his eyes became suffused, with tears. "And shall tell them you will come as soon as you get well?" Charley bowed assent. "Good-by, Charley; keep in good spirits," and John shook his friend's hand most affectionately. Charley returned the kindiy grasp, but no words escaped his lips. He dared not trust himself with utterance. John wiped away the tea's with his rough coat-sleeve, and     252        RAIDS AND ROMANCE grasping again the outstretched hand, turned hastily away and passed out of the door.  The doctor followed him to the stile. "What do you think of Charley's case, doctor?" asked John, as the two walked out. "He is not very sick, now; but I think, from all his symptoms, that he may have a serious spell. He is greatly threatened with typhoid fever." "What shall I tell his parents when I see them?" The doctor, looking down on the ground, hesitated for some time to answer. "Tell them," he said at length," that he is quite sick, but not dangerously so. I will give him every attention, and, I think, with careful nursing, he may be up in the course of two weeks, at most." John shook the doctor's hand warmly, and, mounting his horse, galloped off at full speed. to join his command.

Low, in that still, dark chamber, the young girl bent over the wasted form of the patient sufferer, as she lay there on the soft, white couch, resignedly awaiting the summons of the messenger that should bear her to the mansion prepared above. Long had the tried soul looked calmly at death as one who should deliver her from the pain and sorrow of this present time, and anxiously had she desired his guidance into that " world to come," whose heavenly glory from afar had shone in upon her longing spirit, giving it a foretaste of that fruition which awaits tlhe humble child of God in His infinite presence. Day by day had the immortal being been purified sublimated, and now yet a little while and it should cast off the last lingering remains of earth, and rise to live forever amid joy unspeakable and full of glory I Faithfully, tenderly, had the daughter watched beside the be- loved mother. Gently had her hand smoothed the aching pillow, soothed the fevered temples, wiped the damps of disease from the white, transparent brow; had administered with solicitude to each want, had anticipated every rising desire. Her form was that of an angel minister, her light foot-fall as sweetest music to the loving mother, whose dimming eye would rest with look of tenderest affection upon her darling child. And often would the mother's heavenly aspirations fall back to earth and linger there, as she thought that soon she should see no more with earthly vision this cherished one, who, bereft of a mother's affection and care, must walk the paths of life alone-no guiding hand to point out to her its hidden snares and pit-falls. They were together alone one evening-the mother and daugh- ter. The physician had just left, who had confirmed the/opinion of Mrs. Lawrence, that a few hours more might end her sufferings. It was a soft, still, September evening. The golden rays of the departing sun stole faintly in through the draped window, and rested on the couch of the dying woman, and then fretted out in /     254        RAIDS AND ROMANCE dreamy lines upon the dark carpet of the floor. A fire was flick- ering in the grate. The mantel clock, with its wonted stroke, measured off the last hours of the waning life. Mary, to whom Dr. Hardin's words were not unexpected, for her quick eye had perceived the change come on which marks mortality for the tomb, but upon whose young and devoted heart thie announce- ment of its certainty fell as the storm on the crushed flower-the death-knell on the ear of joy-sat weeping beside the bed, ]olding the cold, wasted hand in hers. Her heart was well-nigh break- ing, yet she endeavored to suppress her emotion, for she would not disturb; by her grief, the last moments of her beloved parent. The dying woman fixed her languid eyes, beamingin their wasted light with love to her child, upon the bowed form before her-then closed them-and the thin bloodless lips moved in rayer. "Mary, my child," she said-her voice was very feeble-"God will protect you, my darling." The young girl sobbed aloud. "Weep not, my child. I go to be forever at rest." She paused, for her breath came feebly up. "'And you--God will shield and protect you. You have given Him your heart. -He will-never leave nor forsake you." The eyes closed, and the ufferer lay silent, exhausted. Recovering, she attempted to'proceed-it required great effort. "Trust in His promises, and seek his gui- dance. And your brother, Mary, should you ever see him again, 'tell him my last moments were spent in prayer to God that he might be saved. Urge upon him the necessity of turning to God. Comfort your father, my child. He will be lonely now. Weep not for me, Mary. 'Tis the Lord-He doeth what is right." /The sobbing girl slid from her chair, and, kneeling beside the couch, buried her face in the clothes, and wept convulsively. The nother lifted her feeble hand and rested it amid the luxuriant curls that fell over the bowed face. "God bless you, my child, and give you that consolation which He aloie can impart. And be thou, O Eternal Father, her guide and strength through all the coming years of life " I The husband entered, and seated himself beside his dying wife Wand sobbing child. His heart was too full for utterance; and as he realized the solemn scene, the tears gathered and swept down his furrowed face. The manly form was buried beneath the weight of anguish that pressed upon the chastened soul. The wife'turned her look to his. Her breathing was growing each moment fainter and more faint. II.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        255 "I am going, my dear," she said, "but do not grieve for me. It's hard to part with you and my dear children, but God, who does all things well, calls me hence, and I must go." She paused for breath. Her eyes drooped. For many minutes she was silent. Her breathing became meore oppressed. The color appeared very faintly in the sunken cheek. She pressed her hand on her heart and gasped as if struggling for breath. Some friends entered the room and approached the bedside. "Air, air!" gasped the sufferer. Mary sprang to her feet and threw open the window. "' Lift-me-up," she feebly uttered. Mr. Lawrence, with the assistance of Mrs. Doiglas and her sis- ter, Mrs. Grant, raised her-from the pillow, and, supported in an upright position, she motioned to be removed to the large chair in which she had so often sat when suffering from this difficulty of respiration. Gently they bore her and placed her in it. She gazed feebly up, while a half-formed smile played round her lips then closed her eyes, and her head sank on her bosom. Her breathing became more and more labored: the pulse in the fallen hand less and less distinct. "Oh, the doctor! the doctor! Run, Maria, for Dr. Hardin., Oh, mother, mother!" exclaimed Mary, convulsively, as she threw] her arms wildly around the suffering form and pressed it to her bosom. ' Oh, mother, mother! can't you speak to me, your child? One word, just one word!" The husband, trembling in every nerve, stood over his dying wife, bathing the pallid brow. Mrs. Grant and Mrs. Douglas rubbed the cold extremities. The anguished daughter could do nothing but cling to the loved form of her idolized parent, and give vent to the bursting grief of ; her heart. "Oh, mjther! don't you know me-your own child, your Mary? Oh, mother, dear mother! speak one woid to me-just one word mother. Oh I you are not dying-you will not leave us. Mother t-nmother!" and the poor, grief-stricken girl sunk to the floor and blasped her mother's knees, as if, in her frenzied madness, she felt a power to stay life's ebbing tide. *The dying woman opened her eyes feebly, and made an effort to look up. The lids drooped again, the labored breath grew fainter, a short, quick gasp, and the mother's life was done! It was but a minute-so quickly passed-it was difficult to re- alize that death, in ghastly form, was in their midst W When the dread reality burst upon them, the father sank on the bed, speech- r\     256        RATMDS AND ROMAONCE less with grief. Mary uttered one wild, piercing icry, and fell fainting to the floor.                 / The physician entered. He read, in a moment, the fearful fact. Assisted by the servant, he placed the dead form of Mrs. Lawrence on the bed, and, turning to Mary, proceeded to restore her. + It was some minutes before consciousness returned; then, springing to the bedside, she threw herself on the' cold, rigid form of her mother, and sobbed as if her heart would break. It was a sad, solemn scene. Death had come to claim his vic- tim, and though nqot without warning, it was hard to bow to his stern, relentless will. Oil, how it rends the throbbing heart, to stand and gaze on the cold motionless form of one who but a'few moments before was with us-whose eyes looked fondly into our own-whose words of love fell on our ear as whisperings from the upper spheres! We gaze, and fear and wonder mingle with our grief, and the awe-filled soul asks itself,-"Is this death?"Ah, what is this strange, dread power, whose fiat none can withstand?  And the spirit-the life that we have loved, with which we have walked and held sweet converse-whlre has it fled, ah, whither gone?-and shall we be permitted again to meet it and enjoy its companionship?                      " ' How often along our pilgrim-path are our most cherished hopes, like the beautiful temple before the whirlwind's wrath, dashed to the earth by this invincible power! We spread out on the glow- ing canvass of the future our life-pictures, colored in roseate tints of expectancy and joy, and when the scene is complete in beauty, and happiness alone is breathed by every form and feature, then $ Death comes and with one bold master-stroke, dashes his pencil, dyed fn darkness, over the picture, and with bowed head and break- ing heart we stand as in a maze, and gaze on the wrecked loveli- ness over which despair sits brooding. Ah, what can console the crushed soul under its poignant sorrow? what impart light to it amid its rayless gloom? Naught, naught, save that promise, all radiant with the beatns of God's infinite mercy, which for eighteen hundred years of wailing and of gloom has come in tones of heav- enly tenderness to the hopeless spirit-l I am the Resurrection and the Life."          Even when w6 weep over the grave of buried love, and in all the misgiving of our contracted vision we ask, with the patriarch of old, "If a man die, can he live again?" there comes swelling up in tones of celestial harmony the response, ." I am the Resur-   OF IORGAN AND HS MEN.        257  rection and t!e Life," and our feeble faith "lifts a wing with the angels," and anchors itself hard by the throne of God. The night wore by. I will not attempt to depict the grief of the stricken husband and orphaned daughter. I Morning came. In the still, silent chamber, hung with the drapery of death, the lifeless form lay robed in the habilimellnts of the grave. Beside the open coffin the weeping daughter knelt alone with the dead. Through streams of blinding tears she gazed on the pale, rigid face, until the accumulated anguish of her soul burst forth in convulsive gasps. She bowed herself, and in the bitterness of her soul wept until exhausted, prostrated- her grief found vent only in sad, low moans., Rising, she smoothed the marble brow, placed a white rose on the pulseless bosom, then kissing and kissing again the icy lips, she took one long, lingering look, and turned away to weep. It was the daughter's farewell to the dead mother. Never again did she behold the sleeping form. Evening came. Slowly the long procession of mourners moved through the streets, wending its way to the "City of the Dead." "Dust to dust, ashes to ashes," said the man of God, as the body was lowered into its narrow house. Then came the rattling of the clods on the coffin-lid. A few minutes of breathless silence, while the hearts of the spectators commune with death, and the low tones of the minister rise in subdued notes to the throne of God for mercy on the dying congregation, wlhich soon, one by one, must turn aside from life and come and take up their abode in the silent chamber of the grave. 1To their darkened home the father and daughter return. Oh, how sadly desolate! How fearfully void! The world, too, is dark, the heavens hung with gloom. Light, light! Ah, it is no- where to be seen. To the chambers of the soul enshrouded in despair, hope comes not; nor is there a whispering of joy in all the music of the earth. -Poor, oppressed mourners! naught save the voice of the Gospel can carry consolation and peace to your stricken bosoms.     25t8       RAIDS AsD ROMANCE CHAPTER XLVII. GENERAL KIRBY SMTHS VICTORY AT BIG HLL, KENTUCKY. IT were a work of supererogation to dwell lengthily on the campaign into Kentucky. Every reader is familiar with its most trivial incidents. The battles of Big Hill and Richmond, in which our men drove the flying foe before them with most fearful slaughter-the successful occupation of central Kentucky by General Kirby Slnith's army-the victorious assault on the Fed- eral garrison at Mumfordsville by a portion of General Bragg's forces-the race between Bragg and Buell for Louisville, and the great excitement of both parties in Kentucky consequent on the relative movements of these two generals-the great rush of Fed- eral troops into the State to oppose and drive out the Southern army-the bloody battle of Perryville-the retreat of the Confed- erates-all these stirring circumstances of War are as household words to every Southern heart. The invasion of Kentucky was a bold, a daring movement. Could it have been made earlier, before the hosts of Lincoln troops were ready for the battle-field, it doubtless would have proved more of a success than it did. As it was, the forces that were sent against the Southern army, although not disciplined, were well armed, and overwhelming in numbers. The movement of the Confederates through the State was so rapid, as to make it an impossibility that large numbers of recruits should join their ranks; and, while in this respect the campaign must be regarded as a failure, the want of success should be attributed to the un- favorableness of the circumstances, and not to the lack of devotion on the part of a large proportion of Kentuckians to the Southern cause. Kentucky is to-day, if her intelligence and interest were allowed to speak out boldly, Southern, truly Southben. She has been duped, deceived, enslaved;' but, seeing the suicidal folly of her former course, sihe is now beginning to awake to a true sense of her position and her rights; and she will yet, let us hope, stand - - ' I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        259 nobly forth in defence of tlhose great principles for which the South has earnestly and victoriously cornbated. Tie campaign has been pronounced a failure, a sad, sad faux pas, and the commanding general has been sorely censured for mrant of ability and oversight of points which would have insurd l /o the Confederate arms a glorious victory. Were the design of the invasion the permanent occupation of the State by General Bragg's army, then, indeed, did the movement most sadly mis- carry. If the object was to withdraw the Federal forces from their threatening position to north Alabama, relieve eastern Tennessee, obtain a supply of provisions and clothing for the men, and give thpe Southern sentiment of the State an opportunity to enlist under the Southern flag, then it was not a failure, even though the ex- pectaticdns of the friends of the South might not have been fully realized in any of these particulars. 3eneral Buell was compelled to withdraw his forces from south- ern Tennessee to northern Kentucky. The Federals, under General Morgan, found themselves forced to abandon Cumberland Gap, and thus was this important point regained to us. Provisions and clothing, to a large extent, were secured, and if recruits did not swell the ranks of the Confederates to meet even our most modest lopes, we must consider all the circumstances, and also remember that General Bragg was clothed with no power of conscription whereby to enlarge his forces to the desired maximum. That expectations were not met, none can deny. But were not our hopes the offspring of desire, rather than of sound judgment? And even if all was not accomplished that might reasonably have been looked for, let us not censure where we do not fully under- stand. Failure does not always argue a want of capacity-and certainly not of patriotism. . The contingencies of war are so many, and so frequently have the best plans of the best generals been de- feated by fortuitous circumstances, that every reasonable mind must admit that "( the battle is not always to the strong," but that the hand of the Lord of Hosts guides to results. The bridal party, after having passed a joyous week at Bards- town and vicinity, returned to the city. In that short time Evan- geline Lenoir had become the affianced of Edward Lasley, a dash-  ing young man of twenty-four, who, having been left possessor of a large fortune just as he had attained his .majority, had given himself up to the indulgence of every whim and caprice that his versatile nature could suggest. Ilis father had diedwhhen Ed ward     260        RAIDS AND ROMANCE was but twelve years of age. His mother, whose wedded life had not been happy, owing to the acerbity of her husband's temper and his continued neglect of her comfort, had never married again, but with the devotion of a tender, loving parent, had given her whole time to the development of her son, devoting herself with the most solicitous care to the cultivation of such traits as her judgment approved, and to the- suppression of those characteristics the indulgence o which she felt must lead him to ruin. But de- spite her vigilant watchfulness, the son had grown up hot-headed, self-willed, and iven to self-indulgence. In his early childhood he had manifested this wayward disposition, and shown sad proof at an early age that he had inherited the sporting character of his father. When at school, he was always the leader in all disputes and combats-the agonistarch of the neighborhood. Handsome, fascinating, when he desired to be, he had won the admiration of Evangeline, who, with all the ardor of her French nature, had been captivated by the handsome face, exquisite moustache, and easy neglige air of the young man; who, in turn, had yielded to the charms of personal beauty, and the magnetic power of her natural vivacity and grace, so strikingly in contrast with the cold, dead manner of the maiden aunt, who was now the only near relative he had. The aunt, with whom he lived, was about sixteen years his senior, fastidious, imperious, captious. Possessed of ample means, Miss Dorcas Lasley led a life of unhappy indolence and ca- pricious gratification, spending half her time plucking the gray hairs from her head, and the other half in. putting them in, by fretting over every thing that came within her purview. When she heard that "Edward," as she always called her neph- ew, was devoting his attentions to Miss Lenoir, she fell into a tow- ering passion, declaring that a boy of his age was not capable of judging for himself, and had better be thinking about doing some- thing for himself in the world. Miss Dorcas, in amonetary view, was the antipode of her deceased brother and his son. Frugal almost to parsimoniousness, she had added each year to the com- fortable estate left her by her father, until she had grown to be one of the wealthy inhabitants of the neighborhood. The bride had returned to spend the fall and winter with her mother. This Mr. Spalding had promised the dohting parents when they consented to the marriage of their daughter. He had decided to engage in business in the city, and the arrangement was a very happy one to all parties. Two weeks. had passed since the marriage-about the same   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        261 length of time since the death of Mrs. Lawrence. During that in- terval, great changes had been made in the position of the Con- federate forces in Tennessee. The plan which had been adopted by the generals as wisest and best for the repossession of that State by the Southern forces, and the occupation of Kentucky, if possible, was hastening to a development. The family of Mr. R., seated around the fire, were discussing the prospects of the fall campaign, when Mary Lawrence entered, clad in deep mourning, her fade expressive of the greatest excitement. Without waiting to bid them good-evening, she exclaimed, breath- less with agitation, "Have you heard the news-the glorious news? General Bragg is coming into Kentucky; going to march directly for Louisville! General Kirby Smith is already in the State, as you know, and he has whipped the Federals completely near Rich- mond, and they are now flying before him as fast as they can run. General Bill Nelson is killed, too, the report says, and the whole army is literally cut to pieces. The Union men in the city are running to and fro, like so many madmen, scared to death for fear the Confederates will march right down on Louisville, and take it before they can get troops across the river to protect it. I never,  in all my life, saw such a commotion; the whole town is frantic. They are moving every thing they regard valuable across the river, and they are really making preparations to surrender the city, I believe." Exhausted, the young girl sank on the sofa beside her. Mrs. R. looked up in amazement, while Mr. Spalding sprang to his feet as if electrified. The young bride remained transfixed to her seat, her face turned with the most earnest'look towards her friend, and filled with an expression of wonder: she was the first to speak- "Oh! Mary, Mary! can all this be true? I fear it is too good to be believed. Have you not been deceived? The city is always so full of rumors that prove so false when you test them; and I fear this is like most of its predecessors." "True, Lu; of course it is. If you could only be in the city for an hour, you would not,be disposed to doubt it " "What is the authority, Miss Lawrence? did you understand?" asked Mr. Spalding, eagerly. "Telegraphic dispatches, sir, from Lexington-dispatches which have been received to-day at headquarters, and which Union men, in their great consternation, could not conceal."  "Oh, that it may be true!" exclaimed the young bride, clasping     262        RAIDS AND ROMANCE er hands energetically. "Then shall we once again see our 'fiends." "Oh, you need not fear, Lu; it is certainly so. The wlole iown is filled with the intelligence. All the Union men believe it. It has come by telegraph, and will be in to-morrow's papers. You never saw such a stir in all your life. People are thronging the streets, and it looks as if everybody were beside themselves. Pa came rushing in after dinner, his eyes starting from his head, and be was scarcely able to speak. We were all terribly alarmed at is appearance, and could not imagine what was the matter, and it was Isome time before he was composed enough to tell us. As Soon as I understood the story, I called the carriage, and Sunday evening as it is, I drove out here as fast as I could to tell you the good news; and now you are disposed to discredit my whole story. Isn't that too bad!" i Oh! no, Mary, I would not doubt, but rather fear to believe est we be sorely disappointed, as we have so often been before." I "Call your father, daughter, and let him hear the glad tidings. He is asleep in the back chamber. Take off your hat, Mary. Did y ou go to church to-day? Mr. R. was not very well, and we did not go in. Really, Mr. McKee is such a coercionist I cannot enjoy his sermons, and I find that we allow the least thing to keep us at iaoe." 'JI was out this morning, Mrs. R., but did not hear Mr. McKee. I go to the Baptist church. Their minister preaches the gospel, and is a good Southern man, though noqoolitician." "Oh! father, father!" cried put Lu, thumping against the chamber door, where her father Wvas sleeping. "Do get up in a minute, and come and hear the good news. The Southerners are all coming into Kentucky-Bragg, Morgan, Charley, all, going to take Louisville and hold the State." The old gentleman sprang from his bed, aroused more by his daughter's wild manner than her message. "Come, father, come to the parlor; Mary Lawrence is just out from the city-come on purpose to tell us all about it. I There is no doubt of it-all the Union men believe it, and are scared out of their wits. Mary says they are dashing about the streets like crazy people." "And what is the news, Lu?" asked the old man, rubbing his eyes to get them fairly open. Oh! come, father, and let Mary tell you herself;" and Lu took his hand and led him along the darkened hall into the sitting-room.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        263 "How do you do, Mary?" said the old man, smiling, and ex- tending his hand. "What is all this wonderful news Lu has been trying to tell me about Bragg and Morgan coming into Kentucky, and taking Louisville?" "Oh! Mr. R., it is all so, sir. Everybody believes it." "Believes what, Mary?" asked the old gentleman, smiling at his young friend's eager manner. Why, that General Smith has whipped the Lincolnites all to pieces at Richmond-that General Bill Nelson was killed in the fight, and Colonel Jacobs either killed or seriously wounded-,that the Yankees are retreating as fast as they can to Louisville, and the Confederates have Lexington by this time. And General Bragg is coining into the State at the head of a powerful army, and the Southerners are going to hold Kentucky. It is true, Mr. R. that General Kirby Smith has routed the Federals at Big Hill near Richmond, and is marching victoriously upon Lexington. This part of the story will admit of no doubt. Pa says all the Union men acknowledge it, and are half wild lest he should move on and take possession of Louisville before they can make any preparation for defence. "And do you think all this can be relied upon?" asked the old man, as much excited as any of the party. "Oh! there is no doubt of it, sir. Pa had it from the most an- thentic source. You know, Mr. R., pa is not a very excitable an, and by no means credulous. He has so often been disap- ointed about the Confederates coming to Louisville, that he is now afraid to believe any thing in our favor. Bt he thinks every- word of this is true; and you would too, Mr.. ., if you could be in town half an hour and see the craziness of the Unionists. They are running hither and thither half the time, not knowing what they are about; but all agree in saying that their forces have been butchered-that is the term they use-at Big Hill and Richmond." "And, what is better than all," further interposed Lilly, who, up to this time, had been a silent but highly interested listener, M'organ will be here and bring all our friends with him. - Oh  won't that be a joyous time! I am sure I shall be too happy. I am going right to work to-morrow morning to prepare for them. All the peaches, and preserves, and jellies that we kept so long last fall, waiting for Buckner's men to come, are nearly gone. I must get to work and bake dozens of big cakes, and make all the nice things I can think of, for brother Charley and his friends. Won't you stay and help me, Miss Mary?" and Lilly sat down     264        RAIDS AND ROMANCE -beside her visitor and grasped her hand imploringly. The ear- nestness of her soul spoke out in hler large gray eyes, and happy anticipation from every lineament of her face. "Can't stay to-night, Lilly, but I will come out again to-mor- row, and we will then' bake the cakes. Pa will look for me to *return. He is lonely now," and a sad look stole over Mary's face as she thought of her great bereavement. ' And then suppose, girls, the boys do not come? You will have baked your cakes in vain." ' Oh, but they will come, Mr. R. And if they don't-but I will not allow myself to think they will not. Lu, don't you intend to make some preparation for them? and don't y6u, Mrs. R.?" 'i Oh, indeed I will, Mary, if there is the least prospect of their getting here. I shall prepare every thing good I can think of," resionded Mrs. R., with animation. She was quite as enthusias- tic as the girls, and ready for any good work. a3  "Indeed, Lulu, I think you and Miss Mary and Lilly had bet- ter prepare lint and bandages for the wounded. They cannot take Louisville without a severe battle, and many a poor fellow must fall before we can welcome our friends back to their homes again."          "That is too true, Mr. Spalding," responded Mary, thought- fully, " and I shall not forget 'your suggestion. Oh, my heart bleeds, when I think that perhaps friends may fall in the strife. Oh, that this horrid war could end without any further blood- shed! But I must leave, it is growing, late, Lilly. Get your ihat and ride in with me. Your father can call for you to-morrow- can't you, Mr. R.?" "I will bring you out after we receive thelmorning news."  "Can't you remain with us to-night, Mary?"  j "No, thank you, Mrs. R.; pa made me promise to be back to- night. He wants the carriage early in the morning for some pur- pose. I only came out to tell you the good news. /I knew you would enjoy it so much. Mr. McKee would be almost tempted to church me, if he knew that I had been engaged in such' Iunholy business.' Don't you think he would? Come, Lilly, where is your hat? We have just timne to drive to the city before dark." Bidding the friends good-evening, the two girls entered the car- riage and drove rapidly to the city.         /   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         265 CHAPTER XLVIII. DEPARTURE. IMMEDIATELY  after the death of his wife, Mr. Lawrence gave up his establishment. Bereaved, saddened, he could no longer remain amid the scenes of his former joy and happiness, now so enveloped in gloom. He took boarding for himself and daughter with a friend, a distant relative of his, who had been left a widow about two years before. Her only child was a boy of seventeen, and Mary finding but little companiohship in the house, spent as much of her time as her duty to her father would allow with her friend Lu, who, though married, yet found a large place in her heart for the companion of her childhood. They already regarded each other as sisters, and Mary found a solace for her grief in un- bosoming her sorrows and anticipations to one who could so readily sympathize with her. Mr. Lawrence's time was very much occupied in settling up his business, preparatory to moving South. As soon as it was known in Louisville that the Confederate forces, under General Smith were assuredly moving into Kentucky, he determined, in tlhe event they had to leave the State, to go out with them, and for this purpose he was daily making arrangements for a speedy de- parture from the city. When Mary reached his room, she found him sitting in his old arm-chair before the fire, his head resting on his hand, and ab- sorbed in thought. i She was pained at the expression of his face, fo in addition to its usual sadness, it wore a look of anxiety and gloom. She approached him, and thrbwing her arms about his neck kissed him, and in a sweet, persuasive voice endeavored to win him from his sorrow. He replied tenderly to her. caresses, and as he gazed upon her, the large tears started to his eyes and silently coursed down  his cheeks. She wiped them away, and inquired the cause. Seating her on his knee, and throwing his arm around her, he proceeded to unfold to her'his plans. "I have been thinking, daughter, while you were out, that now 12     266        RAIDS AND ROMANCE is my opportunity for throwing off this galling slavery, by going into Confederate lines and remaining there." Mary looked up astonished. "Why, father, why need you leave Louisville? The Southern- ers will certainly take possession of this place. There is no doubt about it, pa. Just wait a little while, and you will see there will be no need for you to seek Confederate protection-it will coipe to you."  "We cannot now know any thing with certainty respecting the permanent occupation of our State by the Confederates, my daughter, although every thing now looks go promising. They may be able to hold it, and they may not. If they remain, it will be an easy matter for me to return to Louisville; if they do not, I shall be safe in leaving." Mary looked up earnestly into his face. She did not fully com- prehend his meaning. She waited a moment, hoping her father would explain himself. Bending a sad look upon his daughter, Mr. Lawrence resumed: "Tle only obstacle in the way, Mary, is leaving you." "Leaving me, pa!" she exclaimed, with surprise. 'You surely wouldn't go and leave me behind What would I do with- out you?" The father scarcely knew how to reply. There were difficulties in either case, which he hardly knew how to meet. After think- ing for some moments, during which time Mary gazed beseechingly upon him, he said:   , "If I stay here, my daughter, I may be arrested at any moment, and sent to prison. If I go, I shall be free from this dreadful ap- prehension. If the Confederates remain in Kentucly, I can return to you again; if not, I can send fop you at any timie. You will be safe here among your friends, in any event, and I may have an opportunity to send for you if the Confederates are driven back. For me to remain longer is to endanger my liberty. And as my preparations are nearly completed, I feel I had better set out the first suitable opportunity." "You are right, pa," said Mary, throwing her arms about her father. "I would rather you were safe in the Confederacy, than to have you remain here, all the time in fear. And then, as you say, they may arrest you and put you in prison, as they did last summer, when Morgan was here, and perhaps they would not re- lease you in years to come. But, pa, why can't I go with you  You know I'm not afraid of danger."   OF MORGAN AND HS iw;i.        261' "But, Mary, you had better wait until I can get through, and secure a home for you. I shall have to go clandestinely; they would not grant nre a pass, and I may have to walk half the way to Lexington.. The roads are thronged, I suppose, with the Fed- erals retreating upon Louisville." "But when will you go, pa?" "To-morrow evening, if I get all arrangements made. I will drive out to Dr. Foree's, and send the carriage back, depending on their kindness to convey me beyond danger. It is best that I ,should go, Mary," added the father, as he saw the flushing face of his child, and readily understood the mighty effort it required for her to suppress her tears. "You understand it all, my child? Mary buried her head without speaking. Her judgment ap- proved her father's suggestion-her feelings revolted against it. "And you will send for me just as soon as you determine what is best to be done-won't youi pa?" she said, as cheerfully as she could. "Yes, my child; or come after you myself, if circumstances will allow." * ' I must go to Lilly, now; I left her down stairs, with cousin Pauline. To-morrow, pa, I will arrange your clothes;" and kiss- ing her father again, she arose from his knee, and went down stairs in search of her friend. Exhausted from the excitement of the day, Mary sought her room at an early hour. After conversing for some time on the prospects before them, the two girls retired to bed. Lilly, young and free from all care, soon fell asleep; but Mary, to whom the last year had taught many a sad lesson of anxiety and thought, lay, her mind distracted with doubt and apprehension, and many a slowly measured hour wore by before she could calm herself to sleep. She awoke with the early morning light from her unre- freshing slumbers, and, making a hasty toilet, applied herself to preparations for her father's departure. It was a heavy task for her poor breaking heart to accomplish, but amid her dark trial she had one consoling thought which she constantly whispered to herself: I shall soon get within Confederate lines, and then I shall see Charley and my brother! "I cannot go with you this morning, Lilly, but I will be out late this afternoon or to-morrow. Mieanwhile, you and Lu must begin your preparations. You see what Prentice says; and more- over, the whole Legislature from Frankfort reached here a .few     268        RAIDS AND ROMANCE minutes ago, fleeing in hot haste from the Confederate forces, who, it is said, are now in possession of Lexington." "Be sure to come this evening, Mary; we shall look for you." "Lu said I must not fail to bring you out this morning, Miss Mary," said Mr. Spalding, rising to meet them as they entered the parlor. ' "She is expecting you, and so is Mrs. R. They will be greatly disappointed if I fail to bring you. Come, get your hat; I cannot be denied." "Thank you, Mr. Spalding; it is impossible for me to go out now. I have an engagement that will keep me in the city until late this evening. If I am well, I will drive out about sundown; but, should I fail to do so, look for me to-miorrow. Love to all." "To-night, Mary, we shall expect you," and Lilly kissed her friend and sprang into the carriage. "Don't let me look in vain, Miss Mary," said Mr. Spalding, shaking the delicate hand. "Lu is never so happy as when you are with us."      ' "Ah! Lu needs me not now, Mr. Spalding, to make her happy. You have stolen her from me, and I am left alone." "Soon to be disposed of in the same way, I judge, if the Con- federates reach Louisville," said Mr. Spalding, mischievously, as he seated himself beside Lilly. Mary blushed: the two, bidding her adieu! drove off. Mary accompanied her father to make a last visit to the grave of the mother, and place there some tokens of remembrance. Above the hallowed mound the two knelt and silently wept. Their grief was too sacred for words. The heart alone could indite voiceless petitions to the throne of the unseen Father for guidance and consolation. Ah! what pen can describe, what pencil por- tray the grief of the crushed heart as it bows over the grave ol buried love'? A mourner on the waste of time, the sad soul wanders, and sees no promise of hope, save in the goal which death offers. Placing the mementoes of love on the newly nmsde grave, the father and daughter arose and silently wended their way back to the carriage. Moments there are in the life of every individual, when the heart, communing with itself, holds its joy or grief-too holy to mention even to the dearest bosom friend. We wo ld not clothe our emotions in words to whisper even to ourselves. Evening came. Arrangements were completed: ir. Lawrence was ready to depart.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         269 "Good-by, my child! God bless you and keep you from all- harm," he said, in broken accents, as he pressed Mary to his bosom and kissed her tear-bathed cheek. The sobbing girl clung to her father in silent grief. Oh, how desolate she felt as she stood there leaning against the pillar of'the front portico, watching the car- riage bear away her loved parent-her last friend! As it disap- peared from her view, she burst into a fresh paroxysm of tears, and turned to seek her chamber, that she might weep there alone free from the gaze of human eyes. There is a luxurious relief in tears, when the stricken soul can weep its fulness of sorrow away unmolested by prying curiosity, or cold, hollow words of sympathy. What can others understand of our grief? Even though another as felt what we now feel, has not time measurably healed the anguish? The remembrance may remain-the poignancy is gone. And then, how sad a thing it is to feel ourselves alone in this hollow world! Alone! How like a death-knell falls this hollow word on the isolated heart! To crowd our sympathies, loves joys, sorrows, expectations, hopes, into our own bosoms, there to remain-for we are alone on the earth-what oppressive anguish! How the poor burdened soul feels like bursting as it vainly seeks relief in tears and sighs! We mIst have sympathy. Life without friendship is but a miserable gr ping mid the dark labyrinths of passion and despair. The nature with which God has endowed us requires that heart commune with heart; and the outerlife can as well exist without its legitimate nourishment, as the inner life without sympathy and love. Asceticism is an anomaly-a lusus nature-the contemplation of which should fill every well-poised mind with horror. Mary Lawrence, as she sat weeping in her chamber, felt the need of some congenial spirit to share with her the grief that wrapt her soul. Instinctively her thoughts turned to the friend of her child- hood. Bathing her face so as to remove the traces of her bitter tears and cool her fevered brow she threw on her hat and mantle and calling the carriage, drove out to Mr. R.'s. "Why, Mary'dear! what is the matter with you?" exclaimed Lu, as she threw her arms about the young girl and kissed her. "You look as if you had been weeping for hours. No bad news I hope. Do tell me, have you heard any bad intelligence?" Her Voice was tremulous, and she grew ashen pale as she looked "pon Mary, who had burst into a flood of tears.     270   .     RAIDS AND ROMANCE ' 't Come into mother's room," she said, as, gently taking ,her hand, she led her along the hall to the family-room. "Why, Mary-Lu,-what is the matter with the girls?" said Mrs. R., as she sprang from her seat, and clasping Mary in her arms, partly bore her to a rocking-chair which stood beside the window, near the fire.          l The mother looked inquiringly at her daughter. Mrs. Spalding shook her head.        . "Oh, Mary, do tell me, my child, why you weep! Have you heard any bad news from the army? Are any of our friends sick or dead?"  Suppressing her emotion as well as she could, the sobbing girl ! ejaculated in broken sentences: "No--no--Mrs. R., not that.  Pa has gone-gone-to the army." '"Your father gone to the army, Mary!" exclaimed Mrs. R. and her daughter at the same moment, their voice and manner betray- ing the greatest surprise. "Yes, gone--gone-left this morning for Lexington." "To join General Smith? Why, how can he get there, child?" Mrs. R., with the gentleness of a mother, removed Mary's hat and mantle, and by kind words endeavored to soothe her. After a few moments, she sufficiently recovered from her emo- tion to tell Mrs. R. the sad tale of her sorrow. The friends were greatly surprised to hear of Mr. Lawrence's sudden departure, but when the reasons were given, his course ap- peared one of wisdom. Mr. R. had returned from the city and brought with him the Bulletin and the Evening News. The latest telegrams were filled with the success of the Confederates, their advance towards Ldtiis- ville and'Cincinnati, and the consequent panic and dismay of Union sympathizers and Yankee soldiery.   i It was asserted by Prentice, as a fact incontestable, that General Bragg was marching northward, with the avowed design of tak- ing permanent possession of Kentucky; also, that Colonel John H. Morgan, at the head of a large cavalry force, had been dispatched to intercept the Federal General Morgan, ih his retreat from Cum- berland Gap. The tone of the editorials was gloomy enough. Unionists were quaking with alarm. The entire State was threat- ened, a part of it already in the possession of the Conf!derates, who were daily extending their lines, and daily receivinD acces- sions to their ranks. *                         ! . I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         271 "Oh! do you think, Mr. Spalding, that we shall be able to hold Kentucky?" said Mary, as she threw aside the paper, and leaned earnestly forward to catch his reply. "Old Prentice is evidently alarmed, and Harney too. I wonder why they didn't send Col- onel Morgan to take .Louisville? I am afraid General Smith will wait until the Lincolnites are so strong here it will be difficult to do. They are coming in every day, and I see it is stated in the News that General Nelson will take command here in a few days. I thought he was severely wounded?" "And so he was, Miss Mary, but it has been two weeks, you know, since the battle, and he has mneasurably recovered." "Mr. R., do you think the Southerners will hold Kentucky?" 1"Indeed, I cannot tell, Mary. That will depend greatly, yes, entirely, on General Bragg. It is impossible for General Smith to do so without assistance. There is a great contrariety of opinion respecting Bragg's intentions; some believing that he designs to remain here through the winter-others that he only wishes to force Buell from Tennessee, and regain Cumberland Gap; by for- cing General Morgan to abandon it. I confess, from the confused and contradictory statements of our papers, I am unable to form any just decision. No one can decide fully what will be the end of this mighty movement. We can but hope that it may prove eminently successful; but there are two to play the game, and some of the Unionists are sanguine that the whole thing will prove a failure." "On what do they base their hopes, Mr. R.?" asked his wife. "On their numbers, and the hope that Buell, who is moving rapidly on Louisville, will reach here before Bragg. In which event, they feel confident that with nis own army, combined with the reinforcements that they can bring to this point from Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio, he sNill soon drive the Confederates South again." "I hope the Confederates will not attempt to come to Louisville now," interposed Mr. Spalding. "Oh! do not say so. Why do you wish this?" exclaimed Mrs. Spalding and Mary. "For these reasons," replied Mr. Spalding. "It would not be worth the trouble and loss o life, even if they should take it. Every thing of value has been removed beyond the river. They would only get some shoes and clothing which the Southern ele- ment now holds, and this they will get anyhow, if they but hold central Kentucky. And, moreover, if they should take the city,     272        RAIDS AND ROMANCE they could not hold it against the gunboats and the artillery the enemy could bring to bear against it from the opposite side of the river." "But would the Yankees shell it, Mr. Spalding, do you think? Is there not too much Union capital here for that?" "But, even admitting, Mr. R., that this would not be done, it would certainly be too far north for a base of the Confederates. They should be nearer the centre of the State. Remember, the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers are in the hands of the enemy." "That is very true, sir; and I suppose if the Confederates leave the State, they would go out by way of Cumberland Gap?" "Undoubtedly so. There is no other safe exit for them. And your father has gone to Lexington, Mary? I was astonished when Mr. Sparke told me of it. What was his idea for leaving?" "To get into Dixie, Mr. R.," replied Mary, choking Idown the tears that were ready to overflow at the mere mention of her father's name. "It has been his intention for some time to go South as soon as he could; and regarding this as a fine opportu- nity to get within Confederatei boundary, he determined to avail himself of it, fearing if le should delay he might have difficulty, even if he succeeded at all, and that if he remained he would be imprisoned." "A very wise decision, I think. And he has left you to us, I hope, Mary?" "Oh I am going through, too, just as soon as pa finds out what the Southerners are going to do." i'But you will stay with us, Mary, until you do go through?" said Lilly, beseechingly. Oh yes, Lilly, I will stay with you a great deal. This is more like home to me now than any other spot on earth. You know I never go to my old home now that another owns it." Ten o'clock came. The family retired. Lilly and Mary re- mained in the sitting-room, as girls are wont to do, after the others had left, to talk over their own particular plans. "Oh, Mary, how I wish I could go through to Lexington with you! I am almost crazy to see brother Charley. I wonder if pa will let me go? You know he consented for sister Lu to go to Camp Chafe." "We can ask himi Lilly. I hope he will, I should be so glad to hlave you go with me."

"Or, Lilly, if you can't go Somith, you could remain in Lexington or Georgetown until the railroad communication is established, and then return to the city." "That I could. And I'll ask pa to-morrow to let me go. Sis- ter Lu will be here to keep mother company, and I shan't go to school any more this fall. I expect, Mary, Evangeline Lenoir would be glad to go with us. You know her sweetheart, Harry Roberts, is with John Morgan?"' "Oh, my dear girl, you are mistaken. Harry used to be Evan- geline's sweetheart, but she has proved false to him. Don't you know she is engaged to Edward Lasley, of Bardstown?" "Oh, I don't believe that, Mary. I have heard it. But, surely she would never think of giving up such a lover as Harry Roberts for young Lasley. Lasley has nothing to recommend him but his fine appearance and his fortune, while Harry is noble, true, brave, one of the finest young men in all this city. "B But Evangeline is assuredly engaged to Ed. Lasley. I know it, and they are to be married the 16th of next month. She wished me to be bridemaid; but you know, even if I were going to remain here, I could not accept her invitation. I would not change my dress to be married myself." "Oh, is it possible! How shameful in Evangeline to treat Harry so. He is one of the noblest young men in the world. She may live to repent her folly. Ed. Lasley is by no means steady in his h'abits." !"But he has money. Evangeline has none. And, moreover, she is fickle."    / "Her aunt is wealthy, Mary, and has no children. Of course she will inherit that fortune. She need not marry for money." "Oh, she is so notional and inconsistent by nature. And what a pity, too; she is so beautiful, so generoub and kind. It will be a sad blow to Poor Harry, when he hears it, for he idolizes her, and cannot see that she has a defect. Poor fellow it is hard. But then, perhaps she would not make him happy, and it may be for the best." "Oh, if she were married, I am sure she and Harry would be happy, she is so affectionate. And she loves him, 1 know."      274        RAIDS AND RBOiANCIK Just then a loud knock was heard at the front door. "What can that mean, Lilly?" said Mary, starting up With fright. The two girls stared at each other, in breathless silence, their hearts beating audibly. "Perhaps it is some drunken Lincolnite," whispered Lilly, as she moved close up beside Mary, and grasped her arm. "Perhaps we were mistaken, Lilly. It might have been some other noise. But didn't it sound very much like a rap at the door?"      ' "Indeed it did; but it might have been some of the servants in the kitchen." The two girls stood breathless for a moment. Rap, rap, rap, went the door again, louder than before. The affrighted girls hesitated no longer, but, seizing thie lamp, hastened through the hall into Mrs. R.'s sleeping-room. i "Father, father," said Lilly, in a whisper, at the same time shaking her father with all her power; " father, there is somebody at the front door-we have heard them knock twice." "Oh, you must be mistaken, my daughter, no one could come here without arousing the dogs. Have they been barking?" 4"No, sir, I have not heard them."' "4 Well, then, you are mistaken, daughter. Go to bed. It's too late for you and hMary to be up," and Mr. R. turned over-to com- pose himself again to sleep. "There it is again, father. Don't you hear it?" The old gentleman sprang from his bed, and hastening tocthe window, called out in a stentorian voice: "Whose there, and what do you want at this hour of the nighlt?" The two girls stood trembling with fear, lest a bullet from some Lincoln gun should speed its way into the room. "Be still, girls; let's hear what the man says," whispered Mrs. R., as her husband threw open the shutters. "Who are you?" repeated the old gentleman, as the visitor, forsaking the porch, approached and stood under the window. "A Southern soldier-one of Morgan's men," was the answer. "Charley-Charley 1" shrieked Lilly, and rushed to the win- dow. Her father caught her and drew her back. "Charley 1" she exclaimed, " is that you, my brother-my brother?" "It is not your brother, but I bring news from him." "And where is he-oh, tell me, is my brother dead?" "Be still, my daughter," said Mrs. R., as she drew the pale and trembling girl from the open casement.    OF MORGA1N AND HS MEN.         275 Mr. R., having prepared himself, went out, light in. hand, to ask the soldier in.  "I have but-a few minutes to remain, sir. I must be off again to-night, or the Yankees may catch me," responded the young man to Mr. R.'s invitation to enter. "But you will have time to come in and warm yourself, and take a hasty meal. It is several hours to day yet.: Come in, sir; come in." I The soldier followed Mr. R. into the sitting-room, where the fire was still burning in the grate. "I have a letter for Miss Mary Lawrence. Is she with you, sir?" said the soldier, as he passed through the hall. At the mention of her name, the young girl, who stood within the door, stepped forward. The letter was handed her. She tore the envelope and glanced at the name., It was froln Charley. "And is he dead?" she gasped convulsively. "This is writ- ten in Tennessee. Where, oh, where is he now?" "He is still there."  "Oh, do not deceive me, I beseech you. Do not deceive me- tell me truly, is he dead?". and the young girl, unable longer to stand, sank on a sofa beside her, and with ghastly look gazed np into the young man's face. "Who, who?" exclaimed the father, mother, and sister in one breath. "Who is dead? your brother, or--" '"Charley!" was the scarcely articulate reply. "Oh, no, no! I assure you he is not dead+" exclaimed young Brent, for it was he, faithfully executing the pledge intrusted to him. "He is not dead, sir; I left him quite sick, as he writes there to Miss Lawrence; but his physician assured me he would recover." The burdened hearts breathed more freely.    . "Thank God! thank God!" exclaimed the mother, tears of gratitude streaming from her eyes. "Thank God'! my boy yet lives!" !"Be seated, sir," said Mr. R., conducting the young man to the fire, and, drawing up a large arm-chair beforeits genial warmth, led him to it. At this moment Mr. and Mrs. Spalding, who, wher aroused by the noise, had made a hasty toilet, descended the tairway and entered the room. "Why, how do you do, Mr. Brent?" said Mrs. Spalding, a4- vancing, and shaking the young .nan's hand. j  ]     276        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "How do you do, Miss Lu?" said the young man, rising. "Leot me introduce to you ]Mr. Spalding, Mr. Brent."      i "Happy to see you,- Mr. Brent," said Mr. Spalding, shaking hands with the soldier, who looked at him a moment surprised. "Ah me, Miss Lu, I understand. Yes, Charley told me you were to be married, and we had hoped to get to Louisville to the wedding."  "And where is my brother, Mr. Brent? isn't he with you?" "He was not well enough to join the command when we left Tennessee, and we were forced to leave him behind." "( Was he ill?" she asked, quickly.  "Quite sick ; but his physician assured me he would recover. He had fever, and was unable to bear the fatigue of so long a trip." ' Had he been long sick, Mr. Brent?" asked the mother. "Only a few days, madam." "4And was he confined to his bed?" i'Yes, madam. The physician thought he needed rest. He had been taking a great deal of exercise, and was pretty well worn out. - Dr. Lapsley, who is a most excellent physician, will stay with him until he recovers." "And where is my brother, John Lawrence, now, sir?" said Mary, as she folded the letter she had just finished reading. "I left him with Colonel Duke, near Lexington." "And will he not come to Louisville?" ;' Yes, if we take possession of it; but, otherwise, I think Col- onel Morgan's men will be retained around Lexington. It is rather a dangerous experiment for us to come alone into the city. Ol e of our men was caught in the streets this evening, and sent to prison."                  I ' Who was this?" asked Mr. Spalding. "Harry Roberts, sir, of Colonel Morgan's command. Itsseems Harry had a sweetheart that he was determined to see, so he came to Louisville at all, hazards, and this evening some Union man recognized him on the streets, and he was immediately arrested. I took warning by his fate, and left for the coun- try." Just at this juncture Mr. R. appeared, followed by a servant, bearing a large waiter of nice lunch, which was placed before the young man, who was pressed to eat. Mary stood all the while beside the lamp, reading and re-read ing the letter, the tears streaming down her cheeks, and all un-   OF MORGAN AND HSuS MEN.       i 2" conscious of the presence of others. Lilly stole to her side, and whispered: "Did you hbear that, Mary, about Ipoor Harry Roberts? Isn't it sad to think he should come to see Evangeline, and she engaged to be married to another? And now he is in prison-" "In prison, Lilly, where-h' ow? I did not understand," said Mary, looking on Lilly abstractedly. "In prison here in Louisville. Came to see Evangeline, and was arrested."*'  "Poor Harry!" ejaculated Mary. "Sad, sad fate!" "( I will go," said Mary to herself, as she folded the letter, and replaced it in the envelope. "Go where, Mary-to prison?" asked Lilly, With surprise. "Oh, nowhere, Lilly," she replied, coloring deeply. While yoing Brent was partaking of the timely cheer, he has- tily gave to his anxious listeners a brief outline of the Confederate movements in Kentucky since Colonel Morgan had joined General Smith at Lexington. "I must go," he said, rising to his feet. "I wish I could remain longer, but the hours are swiftly passing, the morning will soon be here, and it will not do for it to find me within danger." Messages were sent to friends, Thanking them for their kind- ness, he bade them adieu and departed. ,  ^ \ 1  2 .-     278        RAIDS AND BOMACE  CHAPTER XLIX.'

"Oh, public opinion is but a poor solace for a bleeding heart, Edward I When our hearts are breaking, of what matter is! it' what the world says?"

'"Answer me, Evangeline; I will ndt be thus trifled with}!" and a dark scowl gathered over his face as he fixed his eyes on her bowed form. His voice was severe even to harshness. She felt it, and shuddered as she did. "You will not answer, Evangeline? Why do you treat me thus? I cannot submit to it; I will not longer endure it!" and he sprang from the sofa and, paced the room with rapid strides. Evangeline still wept aloud. "Great God!" he exclaimed, passionately, " am I to be mocked thus? ,What have I done to deserve such a fate? I will not bear this suspense; she shall answer me!" and he stamped his foot in his rage; then strode on across the floor, his whole manner that of a madman. His wrath partially exhausted by his rapid exercise, he threw liimself on the sofa beside her, and forcing her hands from her face, exclaimed: "Evangelin e, you must tell me-and tell me now!" She started and struggled to free herself; but he held her tightly in his grasp. "Do not strive to go from me, Evangeline. This question must be settled now and forever."  She looked at him fiercely, defiantly. r "Loose me, Edward, loose me! iI will not be forced!" All the passion of her nature spoke from her face. "Loose me, and I will tell you all; but you cannot extort from me. one syllable. I will not be driven!" The young man dared not disobey. The inferior one always yields to the superior. He relaxed his grasp, and sat eyeing her with a look of mingled wonder and sternness. Evangeline, nerving herself, drove back her tears, and looking him steadfastly in the face, said, with a degree of calmness quite surprising: "Edward, I have loved Harry Roberts from my childhood. I love him still. I thought when I promised to marry you that I had forgotten him and loved you. I was mistaken. If I have wronged your heart--forgive me, ohl, forgive me! but I cannot        v     280         D RAS D A OMANCE Rf  marry one I do not love! I cannot forsake one to whom my heart is wedded, now that he is in prison and suffering!" The noble sentiment of the noble girl fell idly on the ears of young Lasley. He understood but one thing--that Evangeline could not mrrry him. i'Cannot marry me, Evangeline! Is this your decision? Do forget that you are bound by a solemn promise to do so? You da not break that promise I cannot release you." And why, Edward? you do not love me?" "Yes, but I do love you, and I intend to marry you. -All the ::d( knows we are engaged, and I do not choose to be trifled wittihthus. This passion for Roberts will soon pass away. You only feel sorry for him because he is in prison. A week hence you will feel and think differently. I will give you a week to de- cide, Evangeline," said he coldly, as he arose to leave. "Oh! Edward, I want not a week-not a day. I am decided now. I tell you I cannot marry you while I love another! You ought not to wish me to do itI It would only be to render us both miserable forever. I tell you again I cannot marry you, Ed- ward Lasley!"I ' "You shall never marry Roberts, then, Evangeline!" he said, while his face kindled under the dark working of his fierce pas- sion. "Then I'll never marry!" she replied determinedly. Scowling with the fury of a fiend upon the girl he professed to love, he replied in tones of bitter retaliation:'  "So let it be 1"He paused a moment for a reply; but with the same look of resolution, Evangeline sat silently gazing upon him.

We will meet again, Evangeline. Then--then, perhaps, you will understand me!" As he finished this ominous sentence he turned from her, and, passing out through the hall, left the house. Evangeline's heart stood still, and her cheek grew pale as those threatening words rang on her ear. She could meet the enraged man with boldness as he stood before her with his words of sarcastic, reproach and bitter taunt, but she shuddered with fear, as a feeling of mysteri- ous dread took possession of her bosom. "What can he mean?" she asked herself, as she revolved his   OF  ORG#AN AND HS MEN.       281 . menacing words in her mind. "What does he intend to do? Surely he does not contemplate being revenged on Harry-and yet what else can it be? His words were s9 dark, and he looked so fierce as he spoke! But what harm can he do him? Harry is in prison and beyond his reach. But he is a Union man, or professes to be one. Would he use this power against him? Ah! it must be that! It can be nothing else. But what can he do?" she ask-' led herself. "He can have him sent to Camp Chase, perhaps, and kept there. Surely, he cannot mean to take his life; and if lie did, how could he accomplish it? He could not shoot him- he would not dare do this. But, perhaps, he could hire the guard to do it. Men have been shot down in that prison without provocation --one, merely because he looked out of the window and waved a handkerchief at some girls who were passing. Oh! if he should do this, how horrid it would be! (You shall never marry Roberts!' he said. He must mean by this to destroy either Harry or me. Fearful! fearful!" and so Evangeline trembled as she sat there alone on the sofa in the silent parlor. Lonlg she pondered the last words of Lasley--"There is a future for me; we must meet again, Evangeline. Then--then, perhaps, you will understand me!" "Harry shall be saved!" she said, half aloud to herself, as she rose from the sofa and sought her own room. i                          - ,           / /        I/     282       RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER L. A VISIT TO PRISON. UNDER the auspices of a Union lady, a friend of her aunt, Evan- geline obtained permission to visit the prison where the Southern men were kept, on the day following the remarkable visit of Ed- ward Lasley.                     I It was ten o'clock in the morning. Evangeline, attired in a plain street suit of green, with a hatitrimmed in black velvet, from which hung a veil of green that fully concealed her features, and bearing in her hand a basket of cakes and fruits, with a beautiful bouquet, set out with Mrs. Hanna to visit the prison at the corner of Green and Fifth streets. This building had been, bef re our peaceful people had learned war, a medical college; but, at the commencement of hostilities it was not used for this purpose. The Abolitionists of Louisville, ready to do the bidding of their dicta- tor at Washington, decided it should be fitted up for prisoners, and accordingly men were engaged to put it in proper condition for this purpose. The whole building, with its small front yard fronting on Green-street, was rapidly inclosed by a high plank fence, and barracks were erected along the west side for the ac- commodation of the guard. It was a novel sight to the people of Louisville to see such preparations in their midst. But, notwithstanding the opposition of the Southern people, who believed it an overthrow of all con- stitutional right to imprison men for opinion's sake and the won- der of Unionists who had not yet grown altogether accustomed. to the attempt to enslave freemen, the work went rapi ly on to completion; and the citizens saw in' their midst a large building set apart for the incarceration of men who dared to maintain the doctrine that the free people of a sovereign State had a right to decide on the course they, as a free and independent people, should pursue. As Evangeline pursued her way beside Mrs. Hanna, from Broadway, down Second street to Green, and thence to the prison, she found the streets thronged with men, discussing the   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         283 startling events of the day. As she passed the custom-house, on the corner of Third and Green streets, and slipped in to ask for a letter for herself and aunt, she heard a gentleman at the door ex- claim, with great emphasis: "Yes, Bragg will come; he has got the start of Buell, and is already on his way here, and we have no preparation to meet him. These fortifications they are erecting are mere child's play-only intended to deceive the people into a false idea of security." She started as the language fell on her ear, fearing lest some Southern man, in the gratification he felt, had so far forgotten himself as to utter " treasonable sentiments." She looked hur- riedly roupd, and found to her relief that the words had fallen from a known Union man; of course there was no treason there. As she passed out, she paused a moment to ask Mr. McAllister, the speaker, when General Bragg would reach Louisville. "Be here in a few days, 'Vangeline; no help for it, and then the wretches will drive us all from our homes, and burn our prop- erty." "Oh, I hope not, Mr. McAllister," she answered, pleasantly; "Southerners don't do such things, I believe."  "Yes they do; greatest outlaws the world has ever seen-full of revenge and the devil." Evangeline not deeming it proper to make any further remark to the excited old man, bowed and hastened to overtake Mrs. Hanna, who was a few paces in advance. "What I do must be done quickly," she said to herself, as she walked rapidly on. "L A few days delay, and all is lost." Overtaking Mrs. Hanna, she repeated the remark of the old gentleman. "What do you think, Mrs. Hanna? Is it your opinion the Southern army will reach Louisville?" "Never, never, Evangeline. They wouldn't dare to attempt the thing. Don't you know General Nelson is fortifying every day, and fresh troops are arriving every hour. Old Mr. McAllis- ter is wild, he doesn't know what he is talking about-scared to death, I suppose." "What am I to believe?" asked Evangeline, mentally. ' One tells me Bragg will certainly come. The next moment another says it is impossible. I will execute my plan, anyhow, and then I shall have nothing to fear." The two females reached the prison gate, and were about to    ,                 ,     284        RAIDS AND ROMANCE enter, when the guard, a burly Pennsylvania Dutcmhman, presented his bayonet across the entrance.  Where is your pass? You cannot go in without a permit," he said, gruffly. Mrs. Hanna paused, felt in her pocket, and produced a paper. The man turned it upside down, eyed it very earnestly for a few minutes, wearing all the while a look of great wisdom, and then returned it, saying: "All right, pass in." ) Mrs. Hanna smiled, as she replaced the remnant of a gas bill in ,her pocket, and Evangeline, who had caught a glimpse of it, and iunderstood what it was, laughed outright. The guard looked amazed and somewhat suspicious, but either not fully understand- ing the cause of the ladies' merriment, or perhaps unwilling to admit his ignorance, allowed them to proceed without further interruption. At th3 door they encountered another armed man, who, bowing phtely, asked them whom they wished to fee. They replied they desired to see all the prisoners, but partic- ularly young Roberts.  '; You can see Roberts, ladies, and any other prisoner you may wish, if you will but name them; but you cannot be allowed to make a general visit." "We will see Mr. Roberts, and any other of Morgan's men that you may have here." The soldier called to one of the attendants of the prison, and instructed him to conduct the visitors up stairs and show them to young Roberts. The ladies followed the old man. On reaching the landing they found themselves in the presence of several men, all uniformed. They could not tell whether or not they were Southerners. Evangeline thought they were, and eagerly strained her gaze to discover, if possible, young Roberts. The search was fruitless. Only strange faces peered upon her. She looked round for her conductor-he was gone. There the two ladies stood uncertain what to do, wondering if amid that crowd they were to be left to meet the prisoner. Evangeline trembled at the thought, and the basket she held in her hand manifested her perturbation. At length, after a painful suspense, the old man returned. Evangeline looked up as she heard his voice. Behind him was a young man in prison garb. She thought at first\ glance it was Harry, and was about to step forward to make herself known. But looking again she encountered the face of a stranger, a hand- some man of about twenty-five years of age, who bowed and   RAIDS AND ROMANCE         285 moved towards them, and stood a moment as if waiting to be ad- dressed. "Walk in there, ladies," sid the conductor, pointing to a long room filled with benches that opened on the landing. They did as directed, and found themselves in the midst of prisoners. The young man followed. Entering, they bowed. Evangeline knew in a moment that those before her were Confed- erates, and she-lifted her veil, hoping that if she did nbt recognize Harry, he might see her and come forward to her relief.  "We wish to see Harry Roberts, one of Morgan's men, who was put in prison a few days since," said Mrs. HannatBing to the young gentleman who stood beside her. "Excuse me, ladies," said the young man, bowing politely; " my name is Robertson, and I was told some ladies wished to see me. I'll speak with the guard, and have Roberts sent in." "And so some ladies do wish to see you," said two females, stepping forward from their seats and confronting the prisoner. iHe looked at them steadily for a moment. "AuntJane and Cousin Flora!" exclaimed the young 'man sur- prised, at the same time grasping their extended hands with all the warmth of his ardent nature. 4 Why, how did you hear I was in prison?" "Dr. Henly, of our neighborhood, was in the city when you were brought in, and saw you taken from the cars-he recognized you, having seen you when you were last on a visit to us. As soon as we heard it, we determined to come and see you; but! your Uncle James was taken sick the very day we had appointed to set out, and has been so indisposed ever since, that we could not leave him until yesterday."  "And how is Uncle James now?" "Better; we hope he will soon be well again. He sent you a great deal of love, as did all the children, and says, ' Don't despair you are in a good cause,'" she added, in a whisper, as she discov- ered the eye of a Lincoln soldier fixed upon her. The man moved ' forward and took a nearer position. Mrs. Richey understood the meaning, and quickly changed the conversation to an inquiry for the young man's health' "Pretty good, Aunt Jane, and spirits fine; we have most excellent company,' and aS good fare as rebels deserve, I sup- pose."     o "I am glad to seeybou in such fine spirits, Samuel. It will de- light your Uncle James togknow you bear your fate so heroically. ')     I     I     -            / I     286        REIDS AND EOMANCE He has been greatly distressed since he heard you were here. You know you are his favorite nephew."  "Tell uncle it is net so pleasant as meeting the enemy on the battle-field, ibut as a soldier I have made up my mind to'take whatever chances befAll me, and make the best of my fate.'  "How long do you expect to remain here, Samuel?"  "Oh, I suppose we shall soon be sent fromr-here to Camp Chase, and perhaps we shall remain there until the war ends. Can't tell; these things are so uncertain." Mrs. Richey looked up; the guard had moved back to allow a young Confederate to proceed to the two ladies who were sitting beyond her. Seizing the opportune moment, she leaned forward as if to pick up her fallen handkerchief. "Take that, Mr. Richey sent it. Escape if you can, and come to our house." She slipped a roll into his hands, which the prisoner immediately placed in his pocket. The whole movement had escaped the ere of the guard. "Harry!" "Evangeline!" It was all the two lovers could say, as their eyes met. Mrs. Hanna rose,' expecting Evangeline to introduce her. But the young girl sat still, overcome by her emotion. Her face was crimson, and she trembled violently. No endeavor to be calm availed. Mrs. Hanna seeing Evangeline would not introduce her, intro- duced herself. - "I am very glad to see you, Mr. Roberts," she said, endeavoring to relieve the young man's embarrassment. "Your mother and I were schoolmates, and although we did not meet in after life, I have always remembered our girlish associa- tion with pleasure, and I an happy to meet ypu for her sake, though sad to see you in this place." At the mention of his mother's name the tears started to his eyes. Four years ago she had been laid to rest beneath the green sod in the family burying-ground in the country. Hdrry had idol- ized he?, for she was to him the very embodiment of all goodness and loveliness. He had heard but the day before that his father had married a second time, and this thought seemed to touch his heart the more deeply.   -  You are comfortable here, Mr. Roberts, I suppose?" remarked Mrs. Hanna, desiring to turn the currept of his thoughts. "As well situated as I could expect in a prison, madam; but it can scarcely be styled comfortable. However, I wish not to com- plain. Soldiers must take the chances of their profession."   OF MORGAN AND   ISI MEN.      28' "This is a sad and horrid war, Mr. Roberts, and untold suffer- ing must: yet be endured before it ends." "Yes, madam, war is the most dreadful scourge that can be sent on a people, and this war of wars is to us the most dreadful. And it will become more and more so the longer it is protracted.' "Only in one way, Mrs. Hanna." "And what is that?" "Acknowledge the independence of the Confederacy!" "Oh, that will never be done, sir. It cannot be done, for it would never do to sever this great and glorious Union." " The Union is dissolved already, Mrs. Hanna, and force of arms will never reunite it. But it will not do for me to discuss this subject. You know I am a prisoner in the hands of my enemy- an enemy who thinks that to differ with him is a crime worthy of death." "How did you know, Evangeline, that I wa here? I thought you had not heard it." "Mary Lawrence told me, Harry. One of Colonel Morgan's men told her-young Brent, I believe. II heard it the morning after you were arrested, but they would not let me come until now." She spoke very low, so that the guard who stood by to overhear their conversation might not catch her words: "Did Brent-escape?" "Of course he did, or he would be here." "Oh! yes; he left that night, and I suppose got back safely, as we have heard nothing from him since." This conversation was conducted in a low tone, and as Harry had moved his seat beside Evangeline, Mrs. Hanna did not under- stand it. Observing that the two young people desired to inter- change some words privately, she engaged the guard by remark-, ing: "Rather an unpleasant duty, sir, to watch here; but it is a duty that some one ' must discharge.'" "Oh, yes, mum, as a soldier I have to obey commands; but I would a great deal rather be in the field than here. I don't like the confinement nor the business of keeping men in prison. But these are war times, madam, and the regular order of things is en- tirely changed" "Harry" said Evangeline, while this conversation was pending, you must get out of this prison. Here is my purse-bribe the guard if you can!" As-she said this, she drewsout of her pocket a small purse filled with gold, and slipped it into Harry's hand.

"In this bouquet, Harry, is a note. If you find you can carry  out the plan, be at the second window on Third-street Sunday evening, at four o'clock, and give the signal mentioned. Be plain, distinct, so that I can understand you." I will attend to the rest. Understand, Harry?"    ij      He nodded assent. "Be careful; don't betray yourself. You will be shot if you do!"              - Harry gazed at her in wonder. He had always known that she was resolute and fond of daring deeds, yet excitable and frequently overcome by her strong emotionm o behold he/r so calm, collect- ed, planning his escape from prison; was a manifestation so unex- pected he was filled with astonishment. l Don't look so surprised, Harry ; the guard will suspect you." "Here, Harry," she said, modestly, as she saw the eye of the guard fixed upon her, ' is a bouquet? of flowers. You allow the prisoner to receive flowers, sir, I suppose," she said, looking up at the man with one of her sweetest smiles. "Won't you have some fruit, sir?" and she extended-the basket to him, while she handed i the flowers to Harry. "Those apples and oranges are very nice; i do take some!" The man, bowing politely, reached forward an d took an apple. "Have an orange, sir?"' "No, mum, I thank you; this is sufficient." "Won't you have an orange, Mrs. Hanna?" The lady declined. "Well, Harry, I am sure you will not refuse me." "Thank you," he said. "This young gentleman may have as much fruit as he pleases, sir! Good for his health."/ "Oh! yes, mum; we do not deny the prisoners any little thing to eat that their friends bring them." c' Well, then, Harry, you shall have it all; take the basket!" As he was receiving it, she leaned forward and whispered, "Take the note from the bouquet; it might fall out." Then turning to the guard, she asked, in order to distract his attention: "Do you admit ladies every day, sir?" "t No, mum ; only on Thursday mornings." "And can any one come in then who desires to? I have neveri been here before, and do not understand fully four regulations."'   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         289 Any one who has a permit can come; but our orders are strict, and we cannot allow any one who has not a pass." Mrs. Hanna looked at Evangeline and smiled. While, the soldier was interesting himself to instruct Evangeline, Harry had extracted the note from the bouquet and thrust it down into his pocket with the purse. His manner was nervous. Evan- o geline observed it; the others, unacquainted with the young man's manner, did not. Relieved of her great anxiety, Evangeline regained her natural vivacity, and chatted with Harry and the guard with all the ease and naivete for which she was so remarkable. Mrs. Richey and Flora rose to leave. Evangeline looked up as they did so. Recognizing the young girl, she rose to meet her. "Why, Flora! when did you get to the city? I had not heard you were here. Are you staying at your Aunt Ludlow's, and will you be here long?" Flora answered her questions and then introduced Evangeline to her mother and cousin, young Peterson. Harry Roberts advanced to speak with her. "Why, Mr. Roberts! is this you?" exclaimed Flora. "I am surprised to see you here. I thought you were with Colonel Mor- gan, near Lexington!" 6"And so I was, Miss Richey, and ought to be there now. But, anxious to see my friends in Louisville, I yielded to my desires and returned home, and, in an evil hour, I was betrayed by one whom I thought was a friend; and now I am here en route to Camp Chase. You know ' the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft aglay,' Miss Flora. What can't be avoided must be submitted to; and it is as much a part of a soldier's life to endure hardships as to fight. I have fought, and now I shall bear as best I can whatever is imposed upon me." "That is true philosophy," replied the young girl, her face grow- ing animated under the expression of such sentiments. "No man is a hero without this element of character. We must learn to suffer and to wait. It matters but little where we' are, or how iit- uated, if we but serve the great cause of right." The guard standing nearest her scowled. Mrs. Richey touched her warningly on the shoulder. ' Good-morning, Mr. Roberts. I hope a brighter fate awaits you." ^Evangeline, come to see me; I shall be in the city but a few days longer." 18 ?                    I/.     290        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  "If you will be in this afternoon at five, Flora, I will call then." "You will find me at home and glad to see you." Bidding farewell to the prisoner, and bowing to Mrs. Hanna, Mrs. Richey and her daughter left the room. Your half-hour has expired, mum," said the soldier to Evange-  line, who was about to reseat herself beside Mrs. Hanna.  "Do you allow us only a half-hour to see a friend?" "Had you come earlier you could have remained longer, but our orders are to have no company for the prisoners after this hour." "We will come earlier next Thursday, Mrs. Hanna. It seems to me we have been here but a short time. But then, all is so novel to me, time has passed quickly by. You will allow me to come in next visiting day, will you not, sir?" she said, turning and addressing the guard. "I shall wish to visit my cousin as often as possible before he goes to Camp Chase." "Oh, certainly, mum; if you have a permit, you can come in. I may not be here at all then; I 'am expecting every day to be called out to the field. You know the rebels are marching upon the city, and we shall all have to turn out to defend it." "Why, do you think General Bragg is coming to Louisville?. He will not be rash enough for that, will he?" "He'll come if he can, mum. It is our business to prevent him. I scarcely think he will get here; but these rebels are a determin- ed people, and no one can tell what they'll attempt." "Very true," responded Mrs. Hanna, "but I do not think Bragg V will ever reach Louisville. There are too many men to oppose him." "Good-by, Cousin Harry," said Evangeline, gayly. "Keep up your spirits-'tis as well to be merry as sad. You know what un- cle always says," and she bent forward and whispered, "Remern- ber Sunday evening, before six o'clock-get out if possible, or you'll be sent to Carl Chase. Pretty good logic, isn't it, Harry?" "Oh, very fine, and it shall be my motto for the future. I shall, undoubtedly act upon it, let whatever will betide me, rest assured of that."  Mrs. Hannalexpressed her hope that the young man's imprison- ment might n t be long, but that an exchange would soon be ef- fected in his behalf, adding, "I have a son in the Union army, Mr. Roberts, and, as a mother, I can feel for you. Good-morning, sir. I will call again and see you, and if there is any thing you desire, I will bear the request to'your father." "Much obliged to you, madam. The superintendent, Captain   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        291 Dillard, kindly forwarded a note for me to pa, yesterday, and al- though I have not yet had an answer, I know my requests will be attended to." Mrs. Hanna and Evangeline, accompanied by the guard, who seemed to be quite pleased with the young girl's kind and fascinat- ing manner, passed out into the entry. On the landing, they en- countered Mr. Roberts, Harry's father, with Captain Dillard, the Prison Superintendent, and followed by a servant boy bearing a basket of clothing, which showed from its tumbled appearance that it had been very unceremoniously examined by the sentinel. Evan- geline bowed to Mr. Roberts and passed on. Gaining the street, she bade Mrs. Hanna good-morning, thank- ing hertfor her kind escort, and engaging to accompany her to the prison on the following Thursday morning, and proceeding down Green-street, past the hospital, turned into Centre and pursued her way to Market-street. She walked up Market until she reached the Brook-street market-house. Discovering here a Jew furnish- ing store, she entered and examined several suits of dark clothing. Finding one that answered her purpose, she drew forth a roll of Kentucky bills and paid for it: ordering the merchant to send it to Mr. Ludlow's at five o'clock that evening precisely, she turned to leave. "To whom must I direct it?" "Miss Flora Richey," she replied promptly. "You know Mr. Ludlow's residence, do you? near the corner of Chestnut and Sixth, north side."  The man made a memorandum and placed it on the suit, which he had laid aside on the shelf. On her return home, Evangeline met Mary Lawrence. "I have just called to see you, Evangeline, and the girl told me you had gone to the prison to see Harry Roberts. Is that true? You haven't been there, have you? What will Ed. Lasley say, when he hears you are visiting your old sweetheart in prison? Won't it arouse his jealousy a little? You know he is a Union man, and it might be the means of einbittering his feelings." "Oh, Mr. Lasley must look out for himself. You know it is my duty-so aunt has always taught me-to visit the sick and those that are in prison." Her manner was so full of meaning, that her young friend could not conceal her surprise. d ( Come, Mary, go back home with me, and I will tell you all. You know I was engaged to Lasley, and asked you to attend me?"     292        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "Was engaged, Evangeline I What do you mean? You have not broken your engagement, have you? He if in town now. Took dinner with Mr. Spalding yesterday. at Mr. R s. I was present. He did not act like a rejected lover. Was gayer and more animated than when I met him before. Have you seen him since?"     ' "Yes, I saw him last evening, and for the last time, Mary." "Why, Evangeline, do explain yourself. Surely you are trying to hoax me. For the last time You haven't discarded him, have you?" "Hush, Mary, yonder he comes, now. I do not wish to meet him again. Look! I do believe he reels. Come, quick, quick, into this store, and I'll shut the door, so that he can't see us." The two girls stepped into Mrs. Le Compte's fancy store, on Fourth-street, and immediately closed the door. Mrs. Le Compte looked up from behind her counter rather surprised. "What's the matter, Miss Evangeline, with you and Miss Law-  rence this morning?" iasked the shopkeeper, looking out from under her nicely plaited French cap-border. "A drunken man, Mrs. Le Compte, and I am so afraid of drunken men," and the young girl held tightly to the door knob, at the same time peering curiously out into the street, through tihe glass door. Just then young Lasley, leaning on the arm of a young man whom neither of the girls recognized, passed the door. His face was flushed, his eyes red, his hat slouched-his whole manner evi- denced his condition. It was with difficulty his friend could keep him steady. He was talking in an earnest tone, and Evangeline fancied she heard him say, "And I will be revenged, Nick, see if I ain't."  The two young girls looked at each other in mute wonder. "What was that he said, Mary? did you hear him?" whispered Evangeline. "Something about being revenged, I believe it was. I could not hear distinctly.'l' "I thought so, Mary. Ah, I know what he means. He is threatening Harry., I will tell you all when I get home. Look out, Mary, see if they have turned the corner of Market." "They have turned, but are walking out towards Main-street." "We can go then. I didn't know but that he had recognized me, and would wait until we came out." The two girls left, and pursued their way rapidly towards   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        293 Broadway. Reaching the house of her aunt, Evangeline rang the 'bell, and ordering some lemonade, conducted Mary up stairs to her own room. Closing the door, and securing it so that there might be no in- trusion, the two girls seated themselves on the sofa, and Evange- line told Mary all that had occurred the evening before with young  Lasley, and of his threat that she should never marry Harry Roberts. "' I do not know, Mary, whether the threat was against me or Harry. He may take my life if an opportunity should offer. I have already heard that he possessed a violent temper, and when once excited he is desperate. But I never realized how violent his temper was until I saw him last evening. Why, I tell you, he acted the madman. If I did not love Harry Roberts, I would never marry him now. I would be afraid to do it." "Well, Evangeline, this is all very strange to me, wholly unex- pected. When I met you this morning, I supposed you had been out making preparations for your wedding. You know everybody believes it is to take place on the 10th of next month. I have heard it half a dozen times since I came in this morning. Does your aunt know your decision.?" "No one but yourself and Ed. Lasley, and he doesn't believe it. He said among the last things before he left, that he would give me one week to decide. I fear to tell my aunt. This is the only dread I have on my mind. If she but knew it and was re- conciled to it, I would be so relieved. But my aunt, Mary, is so anxious that I should marry Ed. Lasley. He is rich, you know, ahd an only child, and will doubtless be the heir to his old maiden aunt's fortune. And my aunt wishes me to make what she calls "a handsome establishment" when I marry. She never favored Harry Roberts, and now that he is a rebel, she would be more opposed to it than ever. Oh, I dread to tell her, and yet I must do it. I will never marry Lasley. I love Harry, have always loved him, and if he ever gets out of that prison, I will go to the ends of the earth to marry him. He is brave, noble, honorable, Mary, one that I could love if we had to live in a cottage. Wealth does not bring happiness, Mary. Look at Aunt Cecilia. What is there on earth that she desires, that she does not have, and yet where will you find a more wretched woman? Her fash- ionable friends think she is blessed beyond most human beings, and no doubt many of them envy her her position. But could they lift the curtain and se' behind the scenes, how differently would they feel and judge!" 9  X l     294    R   V RAAMS A"ND ROMANOB "Your views are correct, Evangeline. and you talk quite like a philosopher. But have you considered this matter well? Do you know all iti ivolves?"            . "I have considered it this far, Mary; I love Harry, and I do not love Lasley. -I thought I did, but it was mere fancy. As soon as I heard Harry was here in prison, I felt I should die if I. did not get to see him, and I have walked by that prison a hundred times in the last two days, hoping I might catch a glimpse of his form. I see that wealth does not purchase happiness, and I choose the latter. And besides, Harry will have a maintenance, and a hand- some one, too, if this war leaves Southern people with any thing; and if it does not, why I will love him still, and we will live in poverty."    . "You are decided, then, Evangeline?" "I am, Mary.'- "But do you not think it may be sympathy for Harry, rather than love, that has decided you thus? May you not change your views if he should be removed from you again?" "Oh! but I do not intend he shall be removed, Mary, unless they take him 'to Camp Chase. I am afraid to tell you what I have decided to do. I know you will think it so rash, so wild. But, Mary, you know I have but few in this world to love me; no one loves me as Harry does. Aunt Cecilia admires me because I afford her pleasure and draw around her young and gay society, of which she is very fond; and then, you know, she has no child of her own to bestow her caresses upon. This is the extent of her affection for me. But Harry would lay down his life for me, Mary; he is my best, my truest friend. Why should I not cling to him, even if I yield uj every thing to do it? Will you betray me if I trust you? I liave always told you every secret of my heart, but this is one more momentous than all others. Fill you promise to hide it away in your own bosom and never speak of it to any one?" ' Have I ever forgotten my trust, Evangeline.?" Just then the servant knocked at the door with a waiter of ice- cream and cakes.  Evangeline rose to open the door. "No lemons, Miss Vangy, and Miss Cilla told me to bring you some cream and cakes.            .I "c Very well, Emily; bring it in and put it on the st nd, and tell aunt I am much obliged to her. You must not come, again until I ring for you." ,\ I!   OF MORGAN AND HS MM.        295 The girl passed out and closed the door. Evangeline, throwing off her hat and takingS Mary'S, resumed her seat beside her friend on the sofa. "I have decided to do this, Mary: first, to effect Harry's es- cape; and then, if he has to leave Kentucky, to go with him." "But, Evangeline, how are you to accomplish these two haz- ardous undertakings? You cannot get Harry out of prison; and if you did, how will you get through to the Confederate lines?" "Mary, my belief is that any thing can be accomplished, if you only determine it shall be done. These are times when the very foundations of isociety are moved, and what would be regarded under ordinary circumstances as: insanity, will pass current now for heroism. Many females in every age have dared every thing for their lovers' jsale; why may not I do the same? If I can once get within the Confederate limits, I shall have nothing to fear." "But how- is Harry to escape?" "Oh! I don't know that he will, Mary; that is yet to be tested. His attempt may prove successful; it may not. But you know several havel escaped from that as well as from other prisons. I do not see why he cannot do so too. He has promised me he will try."  ' You saw him tBen this morning and mentioned it to him? How did you find an opportunity? I have heard that all visitors are so closely watched by a guard stationed in the room for that purpose, that no private conversation at all can pass between them and their friends." "Oh, I whispered to Harry, who sat beside me, while the guard was talking to Mrs. Hanna. He looked suspiciously upon me once ! or twice, but I paid no attention to it. Moreover, I carried Harry a bouquet of flowers that had a note concealed in it, proposing a plan of my own, and this I gave him and in a few words explained the outline, so that when he had read it he would understand whls I meant." "Why, Evangeline, you astonish me! You are really a heroine. Who could have thought that you--always so thoughtless, so gay -would have ventured upon'an experiment so full of danger and requiring so much thought and courage?" "Ah, Mary, love is a powerful incentive-a great teacher." "And did you consult no one, Evangeline?" "No one, Mary; I have told no one! but Harry and you. It     296        RAIDS AND ROMANCE must be kept very secret, or the whole thing may fail and Harry's life be the forfeit." Mary sat a few moments absorbed in deep thought. Two or three times she looked at Evangeline as if shle wished to tell her something she dared not communicate, and then, lowering her' eyes, relapsed into thought again. "Evangeline," she said at length, looking up through he r curls, "you have confided in me; I will confide in you. I need :ot ask you to keep faithfully what I tell you from the ears of every human being. I know that under the present circumstances you could not divulge it. You know, Evangeline, that, like you, I am pretty much alone in the world. All my relations, save my father and some cousins, are in the South; and Charley R. is there, too, Evangeline-they left him sick in Tennessee. My father has gone through to Lexington, and I am left alone."  "Has your father gone, Mary? How did- he get through, and. when did he leave? I had not heard a word of his going." "Of course it was best to keep it secret. He has been gone a week, and as I have heard nothing from him, I am led to hope that he has reached Lexington safely. He went from here to a friend's six miles out in the country, in a carriage; froul there he proposed to get forward as best he could. Did not know but that he would hlave to walk most of the way." Mary paused as if uncertain whether to proceed. "'And do you propose to follow your father in the event the Confederates do not come to Louisville?" asked Evangeline, un- derstanding the cause of her hesitation.  "Yes, Evangeline, that is my determination. I am now waiting to see what will be the issue of General Bragg's movements as re- gards this city, and also the permanent occupation of the State. This is all that keeps me here now. Pa said he would send for me just as soon as it was decided what the Confederates would do; but I shall not wait for him to do this, if General Bragg passes into the interior of the State. If he does not come and take me, I will immediately make my way through, lest it be too late if I wait for pa to send some one for me." "Was LCharley very sickl, Mary? and how did you knowr it? and where is your brother? You, of course, have not seen him yet?"             - ' "No; John is with Colonel Duke at Lexington. Young Brent, who came to LOuisville, left him the very night Harry Roberts was arrested and put in prison. He brought me a letter from   Qo MORGA N AND HR MEN.       297 Charley, and came all the way out to Mr. R.'s, where Lwas spend- ing a few days, to deliver it to me."' "And how was Charley when Brent left him?" "Quite sick; had typhoid fever, but his physician did not con- sider his case dangerous. He was in Tennessee, not far from Enoxville, in a private house, where the familylwould take the tenderest care of him. The physician boarded in the house, so that he will need for nothing that kindness and medical skill can afford. But, oh! Evangeline, you cannot tell how miserable I am; I fancy all the time he is dead; dream at night of his sufferings and death! It is horrible, this agonizing suspense. I feel at times I shall go mad. And I cannot hear from him! It will be weeks -perhaps months-before I know whether he is dead or liv- * ing." "Oh, the horrors of this war, Mary! what tongue can describe them? I shudder when-I think of the suffering we have yet to endure. Surely, a just God will punish these Northern fanatics for the misery and death they are spreading over the land I Yes, a day of retribution must come when they shall be made to feel the curse of their own evil doings. I sometimes think I could rejoice if the earth would open and swallow them .up, as it did those peo- ple of old that Mr. Young preached about two or three Sabbaths ago. But, Mary, if you have determined to go to your father, why cannot we go together .?" "O 11! I would be so glad of your company, Evangeline, and we will go together if it is possible. But will you go out to the Con- federates if Harry is sent to Camp Chase?" "No, Mary; if he should fail to escape and be kept here, or be forwarded to any other Northern prison, I would remain here. You know I could but be miserable in the Confederacy where I should never hear from him. There is nothing to take me South but Harry."            I "How soon will you -ca  you-decide, Evangeline?" "In a few days, Mary. I can let you know on Monday morn- ing. You will not leave before then, will you?" "Oh, no! 'General Bragg could not get here before that time. My going depends on his movements. I shall see you before Mon- day. I am  coming to town again Saturday evening to stay all night; call and see me at my boarding-house." "Oh, come and stay with me, Mary! Do not think of going to your room-so lonely, so cheerless it must be, now your father is gone 1" 13*     298        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  ' Thank you, E angie; I shall be compelled to remain at home to make some preparations that will be necessary if I leave." "Then stay with me to-day, Mary."       / "Cannot to-day. I came in with Lu and Mrs. Spalding, and shall have to return with them. They leave at two; it is now half-past one," she said, looking at her watch. "We will meet at church--but you come to see me Saturday."     E "Very well; I'll do so." Throwing on her hat, Mary hastened to her friends at the ap- pointed place of meeting, and they had not yet arrived. Stepping I into a store for a few moments to buy a mourning collar, she heard one of the clerks remark to an elderly gentleman, who stood in front of the counter examining some cassimere, and whose face was turned from her so that she could not see it: "Will they not send our prisoners across the river before Bragg ei  can get here?"       I  She did not hear the gentleman's reply distinctly. The words, "Harry, haste, and pantaloons," met her/ ear, and she quickly con- cluded that it must be Mr. Roberts, who was anxious to get suit- able clothing prepared for his son, before he should be sent to  Camp Chase. Ordering one pair of pantaloons cut off and trimmed, the old gentleman then asked for some pocket-handkerct iefs. In turning to look after the clerk, who proceeded to the fri-nt of the store, Mary caught a glance of his features. It was, aslshe had supposed, Harry's father. Ah, how sad was that usually mild, genial face! What an expression of sorrow haunted the deli), gray eyes and rested around the mouth!                   - "How do you do, Mr. Roberts?" saidi Mary, as cheerfully as she could, advancing towards him and offering her hand. "He looked at her a moment intently. i "Why, I did not recognize you at first, Mary. How do you do? You look changed, my child, in your mhourning dress. How is your father? I have not seen him for several days. I used to meet him almost daily. I thought, perhaps, he had gone from the city." '                      I   - '; He has, Mr. Roberts," replied Mary, lowering her voiceTT "Pa left several days since to join the Confederates at Lexington/" "' He is not going into the army, child, an old man as he is!" exclaimed Mr. Roberts, in astonishment. '"No, sir; but he desires, in the event the Confederates have to leave Kentucky, to go out with them, and he felt the surest way   OF MORGAN AN]D HS MEN.        299 to secure his object was to get into their lines while the army was stationary." - Ah, I wish I could go, Mary. But they have got poor Harry here in prison, and I could not leave him. Too bad that he should have run so much risk to see us and be caught. We did not get to see him before he was arrested. He had been in town but a Ilalf hour when an old schoolmate of his, a Union spy, met- him and recognized him, and had him immediately put in prison." "' And'haven't you seen him at all, Mr. Roberts?" "Yes, this morning for a short time, just long enough to ascer- tain what he needs to make him comfortable. He left all his clothes at Lexington, putting on the worst he had to avoid detection. I am out trying to get him clothing ready before he is sent to Camp Chase."   .    ,' ' Have they decided to send our men there?" ;' I don't know that they have; but of course they will do it if there is any certain promise that Bragg will get here. I would not be surprised if they were ordered off to-morrow morning." Mary's heart beat quickly as she listened to these words. "Poor Evangeline-poor Harry!' she said to herself. Wouldn't it be too dreadful if they should send him away I Oh, poor girl, her heart would break, she is so sanguine now of his escape. I wish I could go and tell her what I have heard. But, then, what good would result from it? ;She could not communicate with Harry, even if she knew it, and the dread would only be a source of mis- ery."     . "Have you been long waiting, Mary?" said Mrs. Spalding, en- tering the store and laying her hand on her shoulder. "1 Why, how do you do, Mr. Roberts? I did not observe it was you ;"the room is so dark after coming out of the bright sunshine. And how is Harry?  I suppose you have seen him." 'He is well and i fine spiritsi poor fellow. He bears his im- prisonment like a; hero. Where[ is Charley? I did not ask for Johni Mary; I suppose they are both With Morgan at Lexington?" "Charley was left very sick in Tennessee, Mr. Roberts.

This is the only intelligence we have had from him since the Confederates entered the State."  "Mr. Spalding is waiting for us at the door, Mary." The two bade Mr. Roberts good-by, and seating themselves in the carriage, drove out into the country. 9  i           '         1.     E   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        301 CHAPTER LI. MARY had scarcelyleft Evangeline's room before her aunt sent up Emily to tell her young mistress to come to her room for a few minutes, as she wished to see her. "1 What does Aunt Cecilia want with me, Emily?" "Indeed I don't know, Miss MVangy. She told me to ,make haste; had sumthin' of importance to tell you." Evangeline tremble4d from head to foot. Her heart foreboded evil. Smoothing her hair and taking off her basque, she descended the stairway and sought her aunt's room. "Evangeline,"! said Mrs. Terrant, " every thing is in such con- fusion herj ave decided to go to Indianapolis for a few days, and. ! leave this evening on the cars. You must get ready immediately.

Your uncle cannot go with us, so we shlall have to take care of ourselves. You know we should not dare to take Emily or Pauline. We no doubt shall have a pleasant visit. It will at least be a recreation, and we can remain until the fate of Louisville is sealed. God grantlit may never fall into the hands of the rebels, though it looks as if it might. Mr. Knott told me there was some danger of such a disaster, and I heard a gentleman remark that the authorities had ordered every thing valuable to be removed to the other side of the river, and the prisoners to be sent to Camp Chase. They seem to be pre- paring for Bragg." /  "But, come, Evangeline, we have no time to discuss these mat- ters now. You had better go to your room and take out such clothes, Evangeline, as you wish to carry with you. Do not leave any of your valuables behind. Use three trunks if neces- sary." "Dinner is ready, mistress," said Pauline appearing atthe door of Mrs. Terrant's room. "Well, come, Evangeline, we will take our dinner; you will then have time to select such clothing as you propose to take.     8302        IAMS AND ROMANCE Come, we will not wait for your uncle, to-day. It is a half-hour earlier than he usually comes here." Evangeline mechanically followed her aunt to the dining-room. She had not once essayed to speak. Her aunt attributed her silence to her unwillingness to go on account of her approaching marriage, and ascordingly said, as soon as the servant had left the iroom: - 1001 n ,: i "You must rite a note, Evangeline, to Mr. Lasley, postponing y your marriage at least one month. Perlhps he may call in this evening. He has not been here to-day, has he? You had better write the note as soon as dinner is over. I will tell your uncle to have it handed to him, if he has not left the city; and if he has, to have it forwarded without delay to Bardstown. Matters are in such a confused condition now, that it would be impossible to make preparations for any thing of the kind. Invite him to visit you at Indianapolis; and if you choose, you can marry him there."  Evangeline sat like some one petrified. Her heart was burst- ing with fear and anxiety. How could she relieve herself from this dreadful position? She could not leave Louisville, that was impossible. But what valid excuse could she offer to her aunt for desiring to stay? Once she thought she would acknowledge all; and throw herself on her aunt's clemency. But she could not do this. It would be to ask too great a favor. And then she remembered her aunt's antipathy to Harry Roberts, and her utter dislike to all secessionists. She dared not make the appeal, so she sat still and silent, her heart beating violently. The color came and went in her cheeks, and the tears would rush up to her eyes, but she would force them. down again and endeavor to ap- pear unmoved. You do not seem to be pleased with the prospect of your visit, Evangeline," said Mrs. Terrant, "I thought you would be de- lighted to have a short respite from this ruinous excitement. For my part, I am almost dead. I do not believe I could live unless I can escape from it awlile. If I find Indianapolis in such a tu- mult, I shall leave my slster's and go into the country, to some quiet village, if such a place can be found." * -' Indeed, aunt, I do not wish to go," said Evangeline, summon- in' all her resolution for the fearful task. "Do let me stay with -UJnle Terlant, and keep house for him whilO you are gone. I will get Mary Lawrence and Mrs. Davy to stay with me." ' Why, Evangeline, on't you wish to go? What strange freak   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        303 has come over you? You are usually desirous to travel. And who will go with me? I cannot go alone; never travelled by my- self in all my life. But why don't you wish to go, Evangeline? What reason can yon have for'desiring to stay here?" "Oh, aunt, I could hot leave Louisville now. I like the excite- mIent. It would take my life to have to go and stay among the Yankees now. You know, Aunt Cecilia, I never did like them." "Oh, ybu needn't trouble yourself about the Yankees; you shall not be adnoyed by them."' "' But, aunt, I hope you will excuse me this once. If it were any other time in the world, I should take pleasure in accompany- ing you. Let Uncle Terrant go with you, and then he can return; and if you desire it, I can come out as soon as the fate of Louis- ville is decided. Won't you excuse me this time, dear aunt, and allow me to stay?" said Evangeline, most coaxingly, quite reas- sured by the kind, considerate manner in which her aunt received her refusal. "I do not wish to force you, Evangeline, but should be very glad to have you with me." "Oh, aunty, you will have company enough when you get there. Your nieces will go with you wherever you wish, and they are most charming society, you know. I will pack all your trunks while you are down town, and will insure that Uncle Terrant will go with you. Had you not better take most of your silver, aunt? or will you leave it all ready packed to be sent across the river as soon as it is ascertained that the Confederates will certainly reach here?" I believe I will leave it, Evangeline. It would be a great bur- den to me to take it with me, and you will keep it in readiness to be moved at any moment, won't you?" "Indeed I will, aunty. It shall be the first thing attended to by me to-morrow. I will have'it all nicely rubbed, and securely put away."  "Get my bonnet and mantle, Pauline," said Mrs. Terrant to the girl, as she arose from the table. "Evangeline, put all my best dresses in one trunk, with my jewelry and velvet cloak, and fill another with plainer wear, and yet another witl undercloth- ing. Pauline and Emily must do the packing-you supervise. I shall leave for Jeffersonville at half-past four o'clock." "Oh, I will have every thing ready, aunt," said Evangeline, gayly, feeling as light as a fairy. Leaving a few directions with the servants, Mrs. Terrtnt then     304       RAIDS AND ROMANCE threw on her bonnet and silk mantle, and drove down the' street, to shop. Evangeline applied herself most energetically to the task before hler. Wardrobes, drawers, boxes, were robbed of their contents to fill the three ponderous trunks, that stood open in the middle of the room, awaiting their filling. Evangeline had scarcely begun operations before her Uncle Terrant came in. "' Heigh-day, Evangie, ain't you and your aunt ready to be off yet? Oh, this trunk-packing--what a nuisance to the world! I don't see what women want with such an interminable quantity of clothing, anyhow. Come, come, make haste, you will not be ready in time. We must cross the river, at precisely half-past four." ,                            X "Go, Emily, tell cook to bring in uncle's dinner directly. Here, uncle, come lie down on the lounge and rest. I want to talk with you awhile," and Evangelinp prepared the pillows in her sweetest manner, and drew down the shade at the heald of the couch, so that the light would not fall too glaringly on the mer- chant's face. "Now, uncle, I have a little kindness to ask of you," said Evan- geline, with one of her charming smiles, as she threw her aunt's large plaid shawl over his shoulders, and smoothed back his hair from his forehead. "And what is it, child?" asked the old gentleman, in a gentle tone. Evangeline knew her uncle's heart was all right. He had i called her L child," with him the most endearing epithet, and so she knelt beside him, and said; "Uncle, I do wish you would go with aunty to Indianapolis, to-night. Now, won't you just for my sake, uncle? I cannot leave Louisville qow, and you know she cannot travel by herself. And aunty is so worn out with the excitement, she really needs a little rest-and then her heart is so bent on going. I shall have to go, if you don't, and stay there with the Yankees until aunty gets ready to come home again. And I would sooner be in Fort Warren; for then I woulTn't be annoyed by them, you know. I never did like the Yankees. I would so much rather stay with you. Now won't you go, just for me?" and Evalngeline stroked back the silver-threaded hair, and patted her uncle's cheek most caressingly."                    I "Oh, my child, I don't see how I can go, I am so busy. Heels over head, scarcely time to draw' my breath; large government   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        305 contract-must be attended to, and it keeps me so busy, busy, busy!"  "But you will soon be back again, uncle. Only one day and night, and the relaxation from business will do you good. I am sure it will, and then I shall keep such a nice house for you.' I am to be your housekeeper while aunty's gone! You didn't know that, did you? And you shall have such good coffee every morn- ing, and such excellent dinners just when you please, and nice lunch at your store every day at eleven, and music in the evening to drive away care and trouble, and every thing pleasant and nice. Now, won't you go? Oh, I am sure you won't say no, uncle!"  '"Oh, you women! Evangie, you women! How you do have every thing your own way! There is no managing you at all. No wonder poor old Adam fell, if Eve was half as persuasive as you women are now-a-days. I am most outrageously busy, but I sup- pose I shall have to go, jtist to please you, for your aunt is bent on the trip, and somebody must go with her. But what will you do to-night? You can't stayhere alone." "Oh, never mind me, uncle, I can take care of myself to-night. I am going round to Mrs[ Ludlow's, to stay with Flora Richey, a friend of mine froln the country. Oh, I am so delighted you will go! And when you get back to-morrow, you shall have every thing so nice, and all your own way, and you shall see what a good housekeeper I'll be. But there is Sarah to tell us dinner is ready. I had you a good, strong cup of tea made. I thought you would enjoy it this chilly day. Walk in, uncle," and Evan- geline assisted her uncle to rise, and led him to the dining-rooIn. During dinner she chatted away so gayly, and attended to Mr. Terrant's wishes with such a pleasing, fascinating manner, that that gentleman began to feeLthat he had made quite a good arrangement in retaining Evangeline during her aunt's absence even though it should cost him some present inconvenience. With no child of his own, it was but natural that the uncle should lavish his love on his young and interesting niece. Evan- geline was the'only child of an only sister, who, at the age of six- teen, had married a Frenchman of some means, and who, imme- diately after the marriage, liad taken his young wife to Rouen, his native city, where misfortune after misfortune beset them, until they were finally left in very limited circumstances. When Evangeline was four years of age, Monsieur Lenoir died. His widow, gathering together as best she could the remnant of     306        RAIDS AND ROMANCE her husband's property, returned with her daughter to America. Two short years found Evangeline an orphan,in charge of her only remaining relative, Mr. Terrant. She brought as her dower a few hundred dollars, which her mother had scrupulously preserved for her, and which Mr. Terrant immediately placed at interest for :the benefit of his niece, when she should marry or becpme of age. She was adopted intoi his own family, and always regarded by him as his own child; and although a man of extensive business and of few words, yet he had found both time and means to make Evan- geline feel that she was beloved by him. '"! must go to the store, child, and make my arrangements," said Mr. Terrant, as he r6se from the table. "And I shall tell aunt you will be back in time to go with her," she said, as she followed him into the hall, holding to his hand. "Yes; I will be here with a hack precisely at four o'clock. Have every thing ready, Evangie, so that there will be no delay." "Oh, yes, that I will. Every thing shall be aufait in time."' Just as Mr. Terrant was about to place his hand on the door- knob to go out, the bell rang. Evangelihe, stepping back to the parlor door, paused to see who it was. Mr. Terrant opened the door, and there stood revealed the form of Ed. Lasley. Evange- line caught a glimpse of it, and with one bound rushed into the parlor. This was the only way of escape. As she stood there trembling, scarce knowing what to do, she heard her uncle say: ' How do you do to-day, Mr. Lasley? Walk in, sir." "Is Miss Lenoir in?" the young man asked, as he moved for- ward to enter the hall.  "Yes, she is at home, sir; walk in, walk in." The young man entered the hall, and encountering pauline, who had gone to answer the bell, said: "Tell Miss Lenoir Mr. Lasley wishes to see her in the parlor." "I will go and see if Plho is in, sir."  "Oh, yes she is; Mr. Terrant has just told me so." Evangeline waited to hear no more. Frightened at the idea of encountering the man who had threatened her, and whom she saw on the street but a few hours before in such a disgusting plight, she sprang into the back parlor through the open door, and gaining the door that led into the hall, stood trembling with. alarm. As soon as she heard the step of t4e young man in the parlor, she glided across the hall into the dining-room, and from thence she gained her aunt's chamber, where, locking the door I   i I          l /   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        307 behind her, she threw herself on the couch near the window and hid her face in her hands. "What is the matter, Miss 'Vangy?" asked Emily, who was busily engaged packing one of the three large trunks with her mistress's silk dresses and laces. "You look scared to death, Miss Vangy--pale as a ghost!" A knock was heard at the door. 1 Oh, do not let any one come in, Emily!1" said Evangeline, her voice tremulous with fear. "Keep the door looked, do!" "It's only Pauline, Miss 'Vangy; don'tlyou hear her voice?" And Emily turned the key and admitted her before the frightened girl could command her not to do it. "Mr. Lasley wants to see you in the parlor, Miss 'Vangy," said Pauline, as she approached the bedside, and stood over her young mistress, who had not yet dared to look up. "Here is his card, iriam." The young girl started up. "Tell him, Pauline, that I cannot see him; I am engaged maling preparations to go to Indianapolis to-night."      ? The servant bore her young mistress's message to the parlor, and soon returned with one from young Lasley. "Mr. Lasley says he must see you, Miss'Vangy; he cannot leave the house until he does. He has Something important to say to you, and he must see you now, directly." "Pauline, tell Mr. Lasley,"' said the young girl, trembling from head to foot, yet with her eye fixed steadily on the servant that stood awaiting her bidding, " that I cannot see him this evening; it is impossible. Then dovou come here and finish putting your mistress's clothes in that trunk. It is now almost three o'clock, and every thing must be in readiness in a half-hour." "What did he say, Pauline?" asked the young girl, nervously, as the servant returned from the delivery of her last message to the visitor in theeparlor. "He says he is going to stay here until he does see you, Miss 'Vangy; that he won't move one step until you come into that parlor!" "Then he will weary of waiting," said the young girl to herself, as she rose from the couch and proceeded to attend to her aunt's jewelry. "Lock that door, immediately, Pauline, and come here and re- move these things from the two drawers to that large black trunk by the washstand. And you and Emily make all the haste you     308        RAIDS AND ROMANCE can. You have but little time; the hack will be here at four, and they must not be kept waiting. This carpet-bag leave; I'll at- tend to it myself. Hand me those rubbers; they must go in it. Put those dresses and those mantles in very smoothly, Emily; and Pauline roll Ithose underclothes very tightly." Evangeline having secured her aunt's jewelry and attended to the important carpet-bag, threw herself on the lounge, where she could superintend the operations of the two girls. Her face was crimson; her hert beat tumultulously, and her temples throbbed violently; yet she "elt she must nerve herself to the task, cost what it might. What she had undertaken must be accomplished, and time was pressing.  As she lay there she could occasionally hear across the hall the footsteps of young Lasley, as he moved about the parlor. Every  time this noise reached her ears, she started, up and looked towards the door. Once she heard him step out into the hall- "Thank God! thank God! he is going!" she said to herself, and suppressing her breath and ordering the two servants to be silent, she waited in torturing expectation for the hall door to open. But the young man, after walking to the front door and looking out through the side-lights, returned to the parlor and resumed his seat. "Why don't you go in now, Miss 'Vangy, to see Mr. Lasley? Me an Emily can finish these trunks in time. And you see he is inot going until he does see you." "Attend to your own business, Pauline, and finish those trunks I I do not wish to see Mr. Lasley this evening, and do not intend to do it." "Oh! if he should remain here until my aunt returns! What shall I do? I cannot explain this thing to her now, and she will be all curious to know about it. Olh,I do wish he would go! What a simpleton to be sitting up there, thinking he will force me to come! I wouldn't go into that parlor now if I suffered death for it! Half an hour le has been here already; he must possess smne patience to set up there all that time alone." "This trunk is as full as it will hold, Miss 'Vangy." "And have you put in all the handsome dresses, and the man- tles, and aunt's velvet cloak?" "Yes, mam." "Well, set it to one side-help her there? Pauline-and then go up stairs, Emily, and look in my room and bring your Miss Cecilia's large travelling shawl and that cloth cloak; she may wish them both. Go the back way."   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        309 Again Evangeline heard the footfall in the hall, and again she started up and listened breathlessly. The young man repeated the same act of going to the door, peeping out, and then returning, walked into the parlor and strode across the room. "IHe is growing restless," said Evangeline to herself. "He will go after awhile; another half-hour!" and she again took out her watch to consult the time. "Another half-hour and his patience must be exhausted. God grant he may leave before my aunt comes!'  Fifteen minutes more had passed. The trunks were ready for strapping. Again the footfall was heard in the hall. It passed. "Thank God-thank God! he is gone at last 1" exclaimed Evan- geline, as she heard the hall door open. She sprang to the window to see him pass out. She waited a moment, wondering why he did not descend the steps. She heard the door close. "Now he is gone, surely!"She pressed her face against the glass to catch a glimpse of his figure; a moment more and she heard the same detested footfall enter the parlor. Looking towards the front gate, she discovered her aunt alighting from her carriage! "What shall I do! what shall I do!" she said, wringing her hands in agony. "There is aunty, and that simpleton is still in the parlor! What will she say when she learns he has been here an hour, and I have not been in to see him?T I have a great mind to go in now-no, I won't. He shall not conquer me by his rude- ness. Maybe heqll have sense enough to keep quiet, and aunty will be in such haste that she will not find out he is here. She has only fifteen minutes. Oh, what will those fifteen minutes de- velop!",  "Unlock that door, Emily, and open the hall door, and tell aunty as soon as she comes in that ll her trunks are ready. Pauline, go and bring those packages from the driver. Did you leave room for them in the brown trunk?" Yes, mam!" All things ready, Evangie?" said Mrs. Terrant, bursting into the room. I have but fifteen minutes. Your uncle will be here in that time with a carriage, and he says I must not keep him wait- ing a moment. He is going with me, he told me. Bring my large shawl, Emily." "Here it is, aunty, and your cloak too." "I shall want them both. I will wear the cloak, and Mr. Ter- rant can take the shawl on his arm. I shall need it to-night. The whole town is in an uproar, Evangeline, about General Bragg's     310        RAIDS AND ROMANCE coming. Oh! I am so iglad I am getting away from it. I should go crazy to stay here a week' longer. Here, Evangeline, you put these things in the trunk, will you, where they won't get mashed. There are some ruches and flowers in that box; I could not get my bonnet trimmed in time, so I bought the materials and will have i it done in Indianapolis. Shop-keepers, milliners, mantua-makers -everybody-are beside themselves. If you had seen Mr. Lasley I would take you with me just as you are, and let your trunks be sent after you. Tell him, Evangeline, that the marriage must be postponed a month, until all this noise and confusion are over. It would be impossible to give you a wedding under such circum- stances." "Sit down, aunty, and rest a moment; you look so flurried. You are ready now," "Every thing in the trunks? Well, then, strap them, and tell Harry to take them out to the front gate. Did you put me up a snack, Evangeline? I may not get any supper."  "No; but I can in a moment."  ", Some bread and cheese, child, and some of that cold ham with a few pickles. Where is my palm fan? I may need it. I be- lieve it is in the parlor;" and Mrs, Terrant rose fromn her seat to get it, as no servant was present to wait on her. Evangeline, who heard her words and saw her movement through the open door, bounded into the room-- Oh, aunty, do sit still! I will get it for you. See, your col- lar is on wrong side out; change it, while I get the fan." She was about to cross the hall to encounter young Lasley in the parlor, when Emily came in from assisting Henry with the trunks." "Aunt's palmi fan, Emily, in the parlor-not a word for your life"                  .  "It's in the back parlor, Miss 'Vangy; I saw it there when I cleaned up the room this morning." "' Get it quickly-not a word about Mr. Lasley I Do you heai?" "Yes, mam," replied the girl, whose wonder was every moment increased by her young mistress's stra ge movements.  Evangeline hastened to the dining-room, and with the assistance of Sarah, the cook, soon, returned with a nice package of edibles, which she deposited in her aunt's travelling basket. "There's your uncle with the carriage. Write me, Evangeline, at least three letters a week-and don't forget to tell Mr. Lasley about the postponement. And attenI to the silver. Emily, you t             I IY   OF EORGAN AND HS MaE.         3" and Pauline do what your Miss 'Vangie tells you, and behave your- selves." And Mrs. Terrant walked rapidly out into the hall, fol- lowed by her niece and the two servants. I         l "Oh! will he come out?" asked. Evangeline to herself. "If he will only stay a fewmomoents longer, all will be safe.1" But the young man, who knew full well how, kindly Mrs. Terrant had treated him, bwas determined to retaliate, if possible, on the young lady whoe had left him waiting one long, weary hour to catch a glimpse at her person. And--oh, horrors!-just as jMrs. Terrant stepped into the hall from the room door, he issued from the opposite one and bade her and Evangeline good-evening, and taking his hat from the rack, proceeded to accompany them to the carriage. "Evangie has told you that I am going to Indianapolis to-night, Mr. Lasley?  Scared away by the Confederates."  "This is the first glimpse I have caug t of Miss Evangie this evening, Mrs. Terrant." "Oh! but a short time in, and Evangie has been so busy."' "Have been in the parlor an hour and twenty minutes." The aunt looked at her niece wonderingly. The girl colored, but made no reply. "Found Evangie very busy this evening, Mr. Lasley?  But I suppose she hasghad time to say all that was necesisary," remarked iMr. Terrant, jocularly. "I have just this moment seen her for the first time, Mr. Ter- rant," replied the young man surlily. The uncle cast a penetrating glance on Evangeline. The rose on her cheek-blushed itself to crimson. She was about to say to her uncle that she had been so busy as to prevent her appearance in the parlor; but conscience interfered and saved her the sin of prevarication, and smiling a forced smile, she remained silent. "Evangie is very tired now, Mr. Lasley, and I  know cannot prove interesting; so you had better take a seat with us and drive down to the hotel," and Mr. Terrant placed the packages so as to give the young man a  comfortable seat. "'We have not a moment to lose; it is now four o'clock," said Mr. T., consulting his watch. ( Come, Mrs. Terrant, let me assist you in; and you, Mr. Lasley."7 The aunt bade Evangeline farewell, whispering in her ear as she kissed her, "Don't forget to speak to Mr. Lasley about the post- ponerentc," and stepped into the carriage. The young man hesi tated. I        I     812       RAIDS AND ROMANE  "Just as well ride, Mr. Lasley," said Mrs. Terrant as she dis- covered his pause. Turning to Evangeline he said, "I shall call and see you at six. Where shall I find you?" "Not at home," was the low reply. "Very well!" he remarked, mistaking her answer, and putting his foot in the step, entered and closed the door. "Good-by, my child; I shall be back to-morrow, without an accident," called out her uncle as the carriage drove off. ,    II \.                    * ;          *  .?.

Closing the door, she threw herself on the bed and gave way to the pent-up excitement of the day in a flood of weeping. It was the outhreak of the tem- pest that had been silently gathering together its mighty fotces. She wept long and bitterly as she thought of all she had endured -all she must yet meet; and as she looked out upon the responsi- bilities of the coming two weeks, she shuddered and recoiled as one who contemplates a fearful doom. How strange, how wildly strange, to her was her present position! She who had been the petted child of fortune-who had lived so dependent on others, and who, hedged about by kind protection, had never felt otherwise than safe from all danger, free from all care! It was the turning-point in her life. She had now assumed to act for herself, was about to cut adrift fronl the old moorings and launch out on an unknown sea. Should sAe succeed, wai the question she asked herself; for she did not for\a moment swerve from her purpose. "Itlis for H lrry," she said; " and whether or not I am success- ful, I must make the attempt. For his sake I will encounter every obstacle, endure every trial, meet every reproach. He is worthy of all this on my part, and I shall not show myself unworthy of him. If I accomplish my purposes, I secure my hap- piness for life; if I fail, I have done my duty-all-all I could- and this, poor as it is, will be some consolation to me amid my grief and helplessness. If I lo not marry Harry, I shall have to marry Lasley. My aunt is determined on it. BIut-no-I cannot do it! Rather than do this, I will forever immure myself in a convent, where,' shut out from the world, I can cherish my own sorrows, indulge my lifelong grief. Oh, should Harry fail to escape I should he be shot, or die in prison! Then-then-what then! God grant he may get out safely!" she ejaculated aloud, as the thought of-his death swept thlrough her mind. '"A life of dark trial mine has been. Fatlterless motherless- no .brother, no sister-an orphan alone in the wide world. And "     314        RAIDS AND ROM ANCE yet my uncle and aunt have been kind to me-bpt they could not love me as my poor mother-they could never understand my heart as she could have dbne. Oh, no one c n love us like a mother-none enter into our joys or sorrows as s e-none forgive like her own tender heart. Alone, alone, I have been-alone, alone, I am now. None truly loves me but Iarry, and he loves me with all my faults; he knows them all, and loves me still I nd shall I not risk every thing for him? dare every thing to remove him from the hands of his cruel enemies? Yes, yes, if I perish in the attempt, I'll try it! I will not shrink now, that dangers seem to surround me on every side; I'll nerve this heart of mine to bear all things, that I may accomplish my purpose!"' and she sprang from the bed, and dashed away her tears, her large black eyes flushed with the fires of her invincible resolve. The clock struck the half-hour. "I must not weep now-no time for tears! Action, action, demands my thoughts, my time, my efforts. I have a great work to perform, and I must lay aside my grief-'tis but a weakness to weep, when duty calls to exertion. Five o'clock, and I must. be at Mrs. Ludlow's. What if my plan should be discovered? But, no! this cannot be-they will think it a mistake of the shopman. But I will be there in time."  Throwing back her hair, Evangeline bathed her face until the throbbing of her brain was partially allayed, then combing the rich masses of her black hair, she changed her dress for a dark blue silk, and throwing on her hat and a black silk paletot, she descended to her aunt's room to give directions to the servants about! closing zhe house for the night, telling them she would not return until the following morning, at ten o'clock. "Be carefu', Emily; see that none of the windows are left open, and shu; the conservatory doors-it will be cold to-night. And poor little Blanche, give her her supper and breakfast, and put her to sleep in your room,"' she added, caressing the little poodle that just then sprang up at her side, and commenced jump- ing around, as if by its gambols it wished to drive the sad, weary look from the face of its young mistress. "Poor Blanche i" said Evangeline, stooping, and taking up the pet in her arms. You are so happy, and my poor heart is break- ing!".  "i You do look so tired, Miss 'Vangy," said Emily to her young mistress, as she came from the dining-room, into Mrs. Terrant's room, where Evangeline was standing with the poodle, smoothing   OF MORGA- AND HS MN.        315 its soft, white hair. "You ain't going to walk round to Miss Ludlow's? Let me tell Henry to bring the carriage, he hasn't put it away yet-stopped to eat his dinner first." "If the carriage is ready, Emily, Henry may bring it round, for I am very weary. But I have no time to lose, I must be at Mrs. Ludlow's at five, and it now wants only ten minutes of the hour. See to it immediately, Emily." The girl left the room; in a moment she returned to inform her young mistress that Henry was driving round to the front gate. "Don't forget what I Pave told you, Emily. Attend carefully to Blanche," she said, handing the dog to her. Then seeing that the shutters were closedi she passed through the frnt hall fol- lowed by the girl.  "Is this a card of Mr. Lasley, Miss 'Vangy," and Emily handed the young girl an envelope, which sh'had just picked up near the hat.-rack.  Evangeline took it, and reaching the hall door, paused to look at the superscription. She recognized the handwriting of Lasley and saw the note was directed to a young gentleman of Bards- town, a fast young man, but a particular friend and intimate asso- ciate of Lasley. 'Evangeline also discovered that it had been recently penned, and that it was unsealed. Her curiosity was excited, but without waiting to give the subject further consider- ation, she slipped the missivelinto her pocket, and hastened to the carriage. In a  few minutes she was at Mrs. Ludlow's door.\ Alighting from the carriage, she rang the bell nervously. A servant ushered her into the parlor, where sat Mrs. Richey and her daughter, and several lady visitors. They were all strangers to Evangeline save Mrs. Dumfries, who was formerly an intimate friend of her aunt; but differing very widely in political sentiment, th  two had ceased their friendly visits, and were now so estranged as scarcely to recognize each other in meeting. After the introduction, Evangeline took a seat by this lady, and the two engaged in conversation. In answer to Mrs. Dumfries inquiry for Mrs. Terrant's health, Evangeline replied that hei aunt's health was good, but that, still suffering from nervousness. she had allowed herself to be scared away by the Southerners." "And you did not go with her, Evangie? Didn't yoa feel afraid of the 'rebels?' asked Mrs. Dumfries, with some surprise. Oh, no, madam; I am not afraid of Southern people. I am     316        RAIDS AND ROMANCE Southern myself. I wish General Bragg would come and take possession of the city, and release us all from Yankee rule, I am so tired of it.".  "Your aunt is violently opposed to that, isn't she?" asked Mrs. Dumfiies, smiling; "and your uncle, too?" "Aunt is Union; uncle says but little about it. He thinks the whole thing is wrong, both parties are to blame, and wishes the war would end. Do you think, Mrs. Dumfries, that it is possible for General Bragg to come to Louisville?"Evangeline asked, the earnestness of her voice attesting the deep interest she felt. i"It is possible, Evangeline, I think, but perhaps not probable. Unionists are dreadfully alarmed. The rumor this evening is that he is marching direct upon our city with a force of seventy-five thousand veteran troops. If this be true, he can take the place without trouble. The troops already here and those that are pouring in hourly, are wholly undisciplined, and could make but poor resistance to such an army. I have never seen such intense excitement as prevails in the city. The Union men don't know what to do, those I mean who are informed and capable of judg- ing of matters. They are moving all their valuables to Jefferson- ville and New Albany. General Nelson, I understand, has ordered all the heaviest guns across the river, to be placed in position to shell the city, in the event Bragg comes. He says he will contest every inch of ground, and if driven across the river he will shell the city from the opposite side; that not one stone shall be left on another, if the rebels get the place." a General Nelson is a very rash man, Mrs. Dumfries," remarked Mrs. Sedgwick; ' I have known him from his boyhood. There is a great deal of bluster about ihim. I do not regard his threats with much terror." "The only fear is his extreme recklessness," said Mrs. Miller; "I judge, from what I have learned of his character, that he is a desperado, and would not hesitate to do any thing that would sub- serve his purposes." "But even if he were crazy enough to attempt to exec ute his threat, I feel confident his own party would not allow him to do it. Union men are more avaricious than patriotic,and will never be willing to be reduced to poverty, even to support their 'best government in the world,'" replied Mrs. Dumfries. "I feel no fear that General Nelson will either burn or shell the city. He would be murdered on the streets first by his own party." After some minutes' conversation on the all-absorbing theme of iO   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        317 the war, the ladies rose to leave. As they gained the hall, the door-bell rung. Evangeline consulted her watch. It' as fifteen minutes after five. Stepping out with the departing visitors, she encountered the shop-man's errand-boy at the door' bearing the package of clothing. "This is tor me, Flora," she said hastily to the young girl beside her. Have it taken to your room. It is addressed to you, you see. I will explain all after awhile." Flora ordered the servant to receive the roll and carry it to her room up stairs. The two girls very soon followed. Evangeline in a very few words explained her plan to Flora. "I know y  I will not betray me, Flora," she said, as she fin- ished her hasty recital. It may not succeed, and should it not, you can readily perceive the necessity of the most profound se- notesy. Put that package away where it will meet no one's eye, ,lot even your mother's, Flora. I will have it taken home to- norrow. I did not know when I ordered it that my aunt would be absent when it was sent, or I should have directed it carried home. But I have to be very cautious; one misstep, and the whole matter is thwarted. Oh, you cannot tell what anxiety I feel. I am almost wild, :Flora." "I should think so, Evangeline. But how I regret I did not propose something of this kind to my cousin. Mother gave him money, and told him to escape if possible and come to us. Per- haps if the two could have concerted together it would have been better for both."c "And they, may yet do it, Flora. They observed that we knew each other. This will doubtless lead to a friendly conversa- tion, which may result in some understanding on their part." "I sincerely hope for this, Evangie. In a matter of escape no prisoner would trust another unless he knew him well." "Can't you convy your cousin a note privately, Flora?" This is impossible. There is no visiting permitted until next Thursday, and your friend is to escape on Sunday, .didn't you tell me?" "Sunday night; but, oh, Flora, if he should fail I Isn't it dreadful to think of!" "He would be in a worse condition than now, Evangie."  "Oh, he might be shot and killed! You do not know how dan- rerous it is to attempt to get out. These Dutch guards are so )eartless. They don't hesitate a moment to shoot a man down f he offends them in the least thing. How many have been shot -      1,            'ii     318        RAIDS AND ROMANCE at Camp Chase for mere trivialities. Oh, I shudder to think if Harry should meet this sad fate. I should never cease to upbraid myself for his death!" and the excited girl covered her face with her hands/and burst into tears. "We muist hope for better thngs, EvaDgie. ou know a great many escape unhurt," said Flora, cheerfully, endeavoring to win, 'her young friend from her grief. Tea came. Evangeline felt no disposition to eat. Her head ached violently, and to her highly nervous agitation had succeeded a most depressing languor. Yet she felt she inust make her ap- pearance at table, and summoning all her fortitude -and assuming, a gayety entirely foreign to her feelings, she desenided the stairs with Flora to the supper-room. The topic of the tea-table chat was, of course, the movement of the Southern army into Kentucky, and the preparations for defence. Various were the opinions expressed relative to the final issue of the invasion, each one being biased in his judgment by desire and fear. While sitting at the table the bell rang. The servant soon re- turner bearing a card, which she handed to Evangeline. The young girlilooked at it for a moment. Her color rose to her very temples, and her hand trembled with agitation. She appeared confused, irresolute. Turning to the servant, she said, in a low tone, 'L Tll the gentleman I am at tea." I The girl bowed and bore the message to the parlor. Evangeline sat and sipped her tea, joining in the conversation whenever it:seemed necessary for her to do so; but her manner- was constEcined, and her words devoid of interest. She plead headache for her want of life and animation, and Mrs. Ludlow in- . sisted she should take a second cup of tea, which, however, she declined, remarking l"That tea did not often benefit her headache." Excusing herself before the family arose, she hastened to the , room alone, and, taking a pencil from her pocket, wrote a few words hurriedly on the card, and laid- it on the stand beside her to await the coming of a servant to bear it to the parlor. Then, as if sud- denly recollecting the note which Emily had found in the hall at home and handed her, she drew it forth and approached the burner as if to read it. In doing so she passed the mirror. Casting a glance into it, she started back at her flushed and wild appearance. "No wonder the children at the supper-table stared at me so,p? she said, as she took a second look; "really, the Witch of Endor could not have appeared more frightful!" Standing beneath the gas-light, she held the missive in her hand, !    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         319 as if uncertain whether :or not to read it. Opening it after a min- ute, she glanced over itsi contents. She saw in the second line her name, and just below it that of Harry Roberts. "It concerns me, and Providence hlas thrown it in my way. I will read it!" and sealng herself on the sofa, she ran rapidly over the first page.  :- "The wretch!" she eclaimned to herself, " does lie call this love? No, no! he shall neve# have the satisfaction of executing his low, base threat. I will release Harry, or die in the effort! But, be his-never, never! I shall neither be threatened, forced, or ca- joled into marrying a man whom I detest. How strange that I should ever have fancied I loved this coarse, heartless man-this man who seems bent on my destructiotf, merely to gratify his pique I He shall never have to boast that he, conquered Evangeline Le-  noir!" she said, as she arched her neck, and cast a look tcon- temptuous defiance on the sheet she held in her hand. "Ah, ha I a very fine plan, indeed!" she said, curling her lip in bitter scorn, as she read the second page. "' He may succeed in 'putting Harry Roberts out of the way,' but never in I leading the proud girl to the altar."' She read the epistle a second time carefully, then folded it in the envelope. "^A very dishonorable act under other circumstances, but, in me, inexcusable now. Thank God! I know his plans, they shall be thwarted. He cannot, shall not succeed." - Stepping to the stand, she was about to add something to her reply. She stood thoughtful for a moment, then, putting the pen- cil back into her pocket, she threw the letter on the stand with the card. In a few minutes, the servant entered the rdom bearing a pitch- er of water. "Girl, take that note and card to the young gentleman in the parlor, and then return and let me know what he says," she added, as the servant was leaving the room. "The young gentleman didn't say any thing, miss," said the girl, opening the door and peeping in. "He looked very mad, maa'amn when he read the note, and took his hat and went out." "Very well, girl; where is Miss Flora?" 4 In the parlor, ma'am. She told me to tell you to excuse her; an old friend had called to see her, and she would be in the parlor some time." "It is all perfectly right. Tell Miss Flora I would prefer to be alone, my head aches so."            320        RAIDS AND ROMANCE The girl passed out, closing the door behind her. Evangeline threw herself into the large arm-chair that stood beside her, and burying her face in her hands, wept aloud. Oil, the agony, the utter desolateness of that moment I There are times in the history of every heart, when the sorrows of life crush out for a time every hope, every desire. How wild and meaningless existence then seems! We shrink from the very thought of our own being, -and unless the soul can lift the eye of faith to the source whence cometh all consolation, it sinks into the dread wish for annihilation. Life! strange, enigmatical life I who can fathom thy mysteries? Evangeline wept and wept. The fountain of tears was unsealed and gushed forth in unceasing torrents. No power of will could check themln  Sobbing, she threw herself on the sofa, and ia- paroxysm of apguislt lay like one bereft of reason. Her brain burnt as with fire, and her heart throbbed almost to bursting. She clasped her hands despairingly, and looked up as if implor- ing aid. "Oh! God pity me!" she exclaimed, "piity me, pity me! -and bring relief to my poore breaking heart 1" A half hour passed. Evangeline was still weeping. Her sobs and moans, so low and piteous, were sad to hear. Flora Richey entered the room. Going to the sofa, she threw her arms around the prostrate form and slid soothingly, "Do not weep so, Evangie. It will all come right." The young girl openedi her eyes and put out her arms to clasp the neck of her friend, but they fell powerless at her side, and the large black orbs closed again, while her whole countenance took upon it a look of unutterable woe. Flora bathed the hot blrow and chafed the cold hands, and poured into the distracted ear tender, loving words. But many an hour passed before the tried heart found peace in sleep i Friday and Saturday were days of restless anxiety, and conflict- ing doubts and hopes. On Friday night, Mr. Terrant returned from Indianapolis, and the vocation that Evangeline had assumed, that of housekeeper, gave her employment which served measura- bly to win her from lher trouble. Young Lasley did not call again during the, time. Evangeline hoped that her note had convinced him that his visits were no longer acceptable. Sabbath morning camne. Evangeline prepared for church. Her uncle was to accompany her. She was donning her bonnet and paletot when the door-bell rang violently. "Who can that be?  I   I         aOF MORGAN At   HS MEN.      321 she said, as she sprang to the window to look out. She could not discern who it was, but she could perceive it was a man. Her heart misgave her. Breathlessly she awaited the servant's ap- proach. "Mr. Lasley is in the parlor, Miss 'Vangie. Called to see if you are going to church this morning." 4"Tell Mr. Lasley I have company, Emily, and he must excuse me." "Has he left, Emily?" she asked of the servant, who returned to announce that the carriage was at the door. "No, ma'am; he says le'll go with master." "Go aPd tell him, Emily, that your masterr is going with me in the carriage. I have borne this insolence'long enough," she said, -..-.passionately, to herself. "I will bear it no longer. He cannot be insulted. He is determined to have his own way in this matter, and make me yield in order that he may show his power. But-if he has governed his old aunt all the days of his life, he shall not govern me. If he wishes to go with my uncle he can do so, but he shall not go with'me." "What does he say now, Emily?" ' "He didn't say any thing, Miss 'Vangie." "And did he leave?" "No, ma'am; he is still sitting in the parlor." "And where is my uncle?" "'In his room, maam; he doesn't know Mr. Lasley is in the parlor." !"What shall I do?" she asked herself, perplexed at her disagree- able position; "if I decline going, uncle vill think it so strange, and I cannot go with this man."  She bowed her head in her hand as she Stood by the bureau and thought for a moment. Then rapidly descending the stairway, she knocked at her uncle's door. In answer to Mr. Terrant's "come in," she entered, and approaching the window where ier uncle was standing, she skid: "Uncle, Mr. Lasley is in the parlor--came to go with me to church. What shall I do?" "Go, child; of course you could not refuse, could you?" ' But, uncle, I do not wish to do so. You know persons always talk so much when a young lady is seen with a gentleman at church in the forenoon!" and Evangeline, despite herself, blushed deeply. "Oh, well, child," said the indulgent uncle, " if you do not wish i \ i              ), ' 14*     {         9 322        RAIDS AND ROMANCE ito go with young Lasley; but I can't see why you don't. But you women are strange creatures any how I You needn't do it; he can walk with me and you can go in the carriage." "That is the very plan, uncle Please go in the parlor and take him with you. See here, I am not ready to go just now. He will understand it." The unsuspecting uncle! did as he was bid. "Girls are very modest creatures anyhow you know, Mr. Las- ley," said he to the young man, after explaining the matter to him as delicately as he could. "All right, I suppose; the strange crea- tures must have their own wayl No accounting for their Wvihims." Lasley bowed assent, but he by no means received the case as did his more elderly friend. Not knowing, however, how to object to the proposition, nor to refuse the polite invitation to accompany Mr. Terrant, he fouhd himself reduced to the extremity of seeming to indorse the one and to accept the other. Evangeline waited until she thought the gentlemen had reached the church, then taking the carriage, she dirove round for Mary Lawrence, whom she found already gone. After services, Evangeline and Mary hastened out of the church so as to avoid observation, and drove home quite in advance of Mr. Terrant.  "I do wonder if he will return with my uncle!" said Evange- line, as the two girls seated themselves in the carriage. "Look yonder, Mary, do! he is with him, and I wager he will be bold enough to come to take dinner with us. If he should, what will I do " "Ohl treat him with freezing politeness, Evangeline."  "Politeness, indeed! I do not believe I could tolerate his pres; ence for a moment. I do not know why I should feel such utter dislike to one whom I so short a time ago fancied I admired; but, Mary, he has haunted me so--his manifested such entire destitu- tion of all noble sentiment, that I am filled with disgust when I contemplate his character." The two girls reached home and entered the parlor to wait for Mr. Terrant. In a few minutes he entered the room alone, and bidding Mary good-day, seated himself beside her. "Where is Mr. Lasley, Mr. Terrant?" asked Mary, smiling. '" ()h, he has gone to the hotel, I suppose. Why, girls, how re  miss 1 was; I did not think to invite him to dine with us to-day. He remarked to me, too, that he would call this evening at foul o'clock,"   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        23 The girls exchanged meaning glances. ( What have you two been doing, girls, that you had to run away from church so hastily to-day? I strove to overtake you, and thus caused me to forget to ask Mr. Lasley to dinner. You are after something wrong, Evangie, child; I see it in your face. Haven t you a guilty conscience on some subject Come, tell me what it is you are about. Some prank I warrant." "No prank in the world, uncle!' replied the young girl, blush- ing as she spoke. "Something is, going on, child, with regard to Lasley that isn't right. He has been here twice and you have refused to see him Be careful-a mati won't bear a woman's whims always!"  But, uncle, I was so busy on Thursday; how could ee any one?"  "And then this mbrning, Evangie"- i Well, I gave you my reason, uncle. Now, be candid, wasn't it a very good one?" "Oh, modest and plausible enough; but if your Aunt Cecilia had been so chary w   whe e were courting, we should never have been married, I can tell you, child! I couldn't have stood all these new-fashioned ideas of modesty; they would have run me crazy." "Oh! but times have changed since then, Mr. Terrant, haven't they?" remarked Mary Lawrence, laughing, as she rose to follow Evangeline to her room. "' Yes, yes; and for the worse, Mary. I'm sure of that." "Oh! no, no,  I. Terrant," remonstrated Mary, as she turned in the doorway to reply. I "You know this is an age of improve- ment inmall things."' "Well, well, may besso; you women will always have things your own way," said Mr. Terrant, bowing deferentially. Mary re- turned the bow with a most bewitching smile on her sweet, sad face, and passed with Evangeline up the stairway. "I am going out with Mary awhile this evening," said Evange- line to, her uncle, as they returned to the parlor after dinner; "You will wish to take your siesta, and should Xr. Lasley come before I retarn-- but of course he will not-tell Em1ily to tell him where I have gone, and he can call at Mrs. Purd 's and see us both." Oh!. 'Vangie, child this will notldo.

"And, uncle, should I fail to be back at ten, won't you tell Henry to drive round for us? We may not have any company to church to-night." "Better tell Paulinle, child. You know I am so forgetful about these little matters."  Evangeline rung the bell, gave Pauline the necessary instruc- tions, then bidding her. uncle good-evening, set out with Mary Lawrence for  rs. Purdy's. Fifteen minutes to four. -The two young girls, deeply veiled, descended the fot steps to the .street and directed their way to the prison. As they w;alked rapidly along, they-encountered several of their friends, but they passed them by without recognition, lest they should le betr:lyed. Street after street was quickly passed, the two girls scarcely daring to interchange a word. Just as they were turning the corner of Third and Green, they met Mr. Roberts in front of the custom-house. He paused as if about to speak. Evangeline trembled as she felt herself recognized; but the gen- tleman, after casting his eye vacantly up and down the pavement, proceeded in his walk.                 i "How sad and disturbed Mr. Roberts looks!" whispered Mary to/her friend.           I "I am afraid something has befallen Harry," was the tremulous reply of Evangeline. "I wonder," she said, after a short pause, " if lie has been to, the prison! May be Harry is sick-has gone away!" she added slowly, as if afraid to give voice to her own apprehension. A few moments more and the two had reached the prison.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        325 Evangeline timidly raised her thick veil and looked hurriedly up and down Green, and in and out Fiftlh-street. But few per- sons were passing. The guard kept watch in front of the great closed gates that opened on Green. A solitary sentinel paced back and forth on Fifth-street. He was a youth, pleasant, friendly, and genteel in his bearing. After taking this furtive survey, Evangeline cast her eye up to the designated window. There stood a prisoner. Was it Roberts? She looked again. The prisoner bowed, and she knew it was Harry I "' Mary, you cross the street and engage the sentinel in conver-: sation, while I stand here to receive the signal. Ask him any thing, Mary, any thing; whether the prisoners receive company, and when; if they behave themselves pretty well? You know wlhat to do, Mary. Go, go  we will Carouse suspicion if we remain longer here!"              i Mary quickly crossed over, and throwing aside her thick mourning veil, approached towards the guard. She paused as soon as she found she had attracted his attention. This she did that he, in advancing to meet her, might leave Evangeline stand- ing on the opposite side, at his back. The man raised his cap as his eye fell on the graceful form and beautiful face of the young girl before him. -Mary bowed, and spoke pleaskntly but modestly, and commenced to question him, as Evangeline had suggested. Evangeline stepped forward, so as to place herself directly in front of the window where the prisoner stood. She waved her ,handkerchief, and strained her eyes for the answering signal. A moment passed. Oh, what a moment of suspense that was to the expectant heart of the young girl, as she stood there ,gazing upward towards that window  It came. The prisoner's right hand was raised, placed on his brow, then drawn slowly across his face, and rested on his shoulder. it was the indication of suc- cess that Evangeline had proposed. She stood as one bewildered, stupefied,o under the rush bf her wild emotion. Harry would be free-a few short hours lwould restore him to liberty and to her I! The thought was intoxicating. Yet another sign was needed: the hour must be designated. She raised and gently waved it a second time. The prisoner bowed understandingly. Evangeline sent up another eager, fixed look. The left hand was raised, then slowly lowered. This gesture was repeated eight times. "Nine o'clock," said Evangeline to herself. Then raising her left hand she repeated the action of the prisoner niua tinmes. As her hand fell the last time, the prisoner bowed tI            '      326        RAIDS AND ROMA'NCE twice, and turned from the window. It was the work of but a minute, and yet what mighty results to these two young hearts hung on its fleeting moments! "Thank God! thank God!' exclaimed Evangeline, "Harry will be safe!"She said no more, but turned to look for Mary. As she turned she encountered Captain Fred. Morton. She had " forgotten to lower her veil, and was recognized. She started backlas if she had met a spectre. The captain bowed politely, and passed on.  "Mary!" she called, unconscious of what she did. "Mary, Mary, do come on." "She was ready to sink under her agitation. Had she been discovered by this Federal officer? Had she? And if so, what would be the result? But Harry is safe, she said. Thank God he is not implicated, and as regards myself, I defy Fred. Morton and all the Yankee hosts; they won't dare to annoy me. Mary responded to her call, and came tripping across the street delighted that she had acted her part so well in the fearful drama. Just as she reached the pavement, on which Evangeline was standing, she met young Morton face to face. She bowed coldly, -and as he passed stiffly by, Mary thought she saw on his face a sinister smile. It was the first time they had met in weeks. She had persistently avoided him on all occasions, which avoidance he had deeply felt. He loved her devotedly-hopelessly he knew, yet he could not conquer his affection. And he felt a constant pique that he should at all times be the recipient of marked neglect. "Will Harry get out, Evangeline? but - need not ask, I read his escape in your face." "Yes, yes, Mary, he will soon be free. The signals were all right, and to-night at nine o'clock he will meet me at the First Presbyterian Church." "O ! Evangeline, we are betrayed, betrayed!" exclaimed Mary, grasping the arm of her young friend. "I am sure we are. Fred. Morton has seen it all-knows it all. We have nothing to hope." "Why do you think so, Mary? Did you see him observing us?" "Oh, no I I was busy talking to the guard. But I read it in  the expression of his face as he passed me. His look was full of significance and malignity." "You are excited, Mary,"' replied Evangeline, endeavoring to   l        I   .        I OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        32' appear calm. "I am confident young Morton could not have seen any one but me. Harry had left the window before he came up. You were on the opposite side of the street, and what could he suspect from seeing ime standing gazing up at the prison?" "Are you sure, Evangeline, that Morton did not see you? Might he not have belen where he observed all your movements?" "I am confident, Mary, that he did not. I heard him approach- ing me from Walnut-street, and I feel assured he saw only me. Don't be alarmed. You and Harry are safe. If he desires to make mischief, I only am involved, and I bid him defiance. I am not one whit afraid of all the Lincolnites in creation." "You are protected, Evangeline, by your Union friends. I am so unprotected. You cannot realize what it is to know you are alone without a friend to defend you. Pa is gone; John is gone, and I am alone, isolated; I have no one to look to, to shield me from the violence of a foe: no one, no one," and Mary sighed as if her heart were breaking. "Oh that pa would come,--no, he cannot, dare not do this, but that he would send some one to take me from this horrid place." "Be patient, Mary; when Harry gets out we will all go beyond Yankee lines and Yankee rule, and be free and happy. I am al- most wild with delight at the thought that he will so soon be free. Do you think there is any possibility, Mary, that he will be dis- covered?" "He is to bribe the guard, is he not?" "Yes, that is the plan, and the matter is already arranged be- tween them." "He may be betrayed. There is a possibility of this. A man who will suffer himself to be bribed, will betray if he can find it his interest to do so. But let us hope this may not be."  "Oh I do not fear, Mary. Harry is very shrewd and would not' allow himself to be imposed upon. But I must secure a hack to take him out of the city." "Better leave his escape from Louisville to his own management. He has learned to avoid detection, and he will be much safer on foot that in a carriage." The girls returhed to Mrs. Purdy's to await the appointed hour. To their great delight they found that Lasley was not in, nor had he called. "And did you reach the city, Cousin William?" "No, it was impossible. Thsy would not allow me to pass their lines."     328        RAIDS AND ROMANCE  "Who would not?" "The Confederate pickets at Shelbyville. I told them the case, and plead with them to let me go, but it was all in vain. Their orders were to permit no one to go out of their lines, and they could not disobey, they said." "Oh my poor, poor child!" said Mr. Lawrence, as he bowed his head and heaved a deep sigh. "What will become of her? I know that she is almost frantic with grief. Oh, that I could but get her here!"He buried his face in his hands and sat for some minutes engaged in thought. Looking up at the young man before him, he said: "Do you think you could get through by way of Bardstown, Cousin William?" "I do not know. The effort might be made. It might prove successful." "Will you try?"  "Most certainly, if you desire it."  Oh, I should be most thankful if you would male the attempt. It may succeed. I will remunerate you to any extent. I would willingly sacrifice all I have to get my child. It was folly in me to leave her, but I felt so sure I should-get back to Louisville and bring her out myself."  "And this you may yet do. The Confederates mgy take the city." "I think not. There seems but little promise of it to me. In- deed I am very doubtful about their remaining long in the State. But Bragg's force and success must determine that. This army of General Smith's will soon have to leave this point unless reinforced. But when can you set out again for Louisville by way of Bards- town?" "Just as soon as I can procure a pass, sir." "This is Thursday. If you do not succeed you will be back by Sunday, I suppose?" "Oh yes, sir, that will be ample time to go and return." "If possible, Cousin William, bring my daughter. God grant you may succeed." The father spoke earnestly. His grief-marked face wore an expression of unusual sadness.  "I will accomplish the object of my mission, if possible, sir." "Take this letter to Mary, it will tell her what to do; and here is a purse, hand it to her, she may need it." The young man bade his friend farewell, and leaving the hotel, proceeded to the stable, where, procuring a horse and buggy, he set out once more to endeavor to reach Lo/uisville.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         329 Two days passed-days of anxious suspense to Mr. Lawrence, who, in the uncertainty of his daughter's fate, was the prey of dire- ful apprehension and alarm. Sunday evening came. It was the 21st of September. General Bragg having defeated the enemy intrenched at Mumfordsville, capturing four thousand prisoners, and heavy stores, was advancing towards Louisville. The news of his successful march had reached Lexington, and every Southern heart was beating high with grati- tude and hope. It looked as if Kentucky was, at last, to be re- deemed from the hand of Northern rule, and placed where she should .be, under the government of the Confederate States. Gen- eral Kirby Smith's army had received many accessions, and through - out that portion of the State regiments were being organized for the Southern army. Every city, town, village and hamlet in the State was the scene of the wildest excitement. The two parties, Southern and Northern, which everywhere existed in antagonism, served by conflicting opinions and desires to keep the flame of agitation brightly bu'ning. It was a time of comparative liberty for Southern men, a season for fear and trembling with the North- ern party. Every thing wasi forgotten in the one theme, that of the advance of the Confederate army. Mr. Lawrence was seated in his room at the hotel, gloomy and sad, under the weight of his own personal sorrows, which neither his faith in God's providences nor the consolation of divine truth, so clearly set forth by the minister of God in his morning discourse, could remove. He was  esolate amid the throng-grief-laden, though surrounded by'the rushing whirl of stormy events. His  only son, exposed to the calamities and hardships of war, his only daughter separated from him within the enemy's power, unpro- tected and alone. His thoughts were away with her, and he was endeavoring to paint to himself what she was doing this beautiful Sabbath evening. And then he pictured to himself the happiness of the meeting with her, which he hoped would not be long deferred. The sunlight came in through the uncurtained window, and fell in rich golden glory over the floor. Its radiant light reminded him) of the beauty of that heavenly home, where dwelt amid the hosts of the redeemed the spirit of his lost wife, and his soul lifted its aspirations to that celestial city which needeth not the light of a candle, nor yet of the sun, for the Lord God giveth it light, and His redeemed ones, clothed in shining garments, worship before the great White Throne, whereon sits the Eternal Father. It was an hour of soul-communion with the stricken father. To him the     330        RAIDS 'AND. ROMANCE joy of the world had become dimmed-life had lost its charms- the earth its false glare and baneful influence. The old man took up his Bible and read, and as he read the tears streamed down his face. Yet, while he wept, his soul rejoiced, for by faith he laid hold on the promises of the Gospel, and his spiritual strength was renewed even amid the heart's deep sorrow- ing. After reading for some time he closed the -book, then knelt to pray. Long and fervently did he supplicate God's mercy and guidance, and earnestly ask for submission to His will. Rising, lihe approached the window, and seating himself, looked out into the busy street below.  While he thus sat,/ a gentle knock was heard at the door. He  rose and opened it. "Unsuccessful again, Cousin William?" said Mr. Lawrence, calmly, but in a low, deep tone, that. told far better than language could have done how bitter was his disappointment. The young man bowed assent, and moving forward to the seat designated for him, explained the cause of his failure. "I must bear it,-though it is very hard," said Mr.'Lawrence, resuming his seat near the window. "If I knew my child was safe, I would ask nothing more. But I have heard nothing from her since I left, and I know not what may have befallen her." I 'Oh, I doubt not she is safe, sir. No one is allowed to leave Louisville now for this portion of the State, and letters do not come except by private hand. You could not reasonably hope to hear from her under present circumstances, I think. I sent your letter by a citizen of Louisville, whom I met on my way, and who: will go in to-mnorrow or the next day." "And they are fortifying the city and have placed it under mar- tial law?" "That is the statement of all who seemn to be at all acquainted witlh the present position of affairs there.'" "And where is General Bragg now?" "Marching on from Mumfordsville in the direction of Louisville. It is the opinion of many Union men ithat lie will certainly take that city in a few days, notwithstanding their fortifications and reinforcements." "I should be most happy t, see it, but I am by no means san- guine. .And yet if he allows them a foothold they will in their turn drive him South again." t"Tile only danger I see, sir, is that of Buell's getting to Louis-   OF MORlGAN AND HS MEN.        331 ville. first. Both armies are striving with their utmost power to beat the other in this closely contested race." "And where is Buell now?" r"In close pursuit of Bragg, it is said. Only a day behind him." "And will General-Bragg allow himself to be hemmed in by the two forces--the one at Louisville in his front, and Buell in his rear? If he does, he will show himself utterly devoid of general- ship, I think." "4 It is said, sir, that the troops at Louisville will offer no resist- ance, but fall back across the Ohio river at Bragg's approach." ) - "But even then he would beyas it were, flanked, unless Buell should cross the river into Indjina. And then the gunboats, to- gether with heavy ordnance placed on the opposite shore, will make his position in Louisville doubtful. I con see but little hope -very little hope." "A few days, sir, will determine the issue. Active preparations are being made by the Federals. They are concentrating large numbers of the newly enlisted men at Jeffersonville and New Al- bany, and are about to construct pontoon bridges across the river at Louisville, I suppose either for advancei or retreat, whichever may be their fortune." 1 Are the Southern people enthusiastic in the portions of the State where you have been?" "Very, indeed. They feel the permanent occupation of Ken- tucky by the Confederates to be a fixed fact. It may be I have caught their enthusiasm. I certainly am iqclined to hope." "But should the Confederates have to abandon the State, what a sad, sad thing it will be for thousands of Southern men, who will have to leave their homes, their wives and children, and exile themselves. or else remain to be imprisoned! Oh, if I but had my child with me, I should feel able to defy every fortune! But the , thought of having to leave her behind almost breaks my heart. I may never^again see her, and she may fall into the hands of the unsparing foe." "She spoke of coming out. But how can she come alone and  / unprotected-? i I would go for her, but should I be discovered, I would be immediately sent to prison, and then shle would be left without any hope. Sad, sad fate for any one so young and inex- perienced!" he said, while his whole frame heaved with the pres- sure of his mental distress. The young man felt it was unnecessary to attempt consolation. He looked upon his relative with deep sympathy. After some     332        R AIDS AND ROMANCE  minutes' silence on the part of both, Mr. Stanford proposed a walk to the encampment. While this conversation was taking place between Mr. Lawrence and his young cousin, Mary and Evangeline were standing before the prison, carrying out the bold endeavor of Harry's liberation. The church-bells rang. Mary and Evangeline put on their bon- nets and shaws. "Who will go wh you, girls?" asked Mrs. Purdy, as the two entered the parlor, ready to leave. "I wish I were well enough to accompany you, but really my head aches too severely. It would be doing myself injustice to go out to-night. There is Lewellen, he can escort you. You will feel no fear with him. Come, my son, get on your cap and go with the young ladies to church." ' Oh, no, no, Mrs. Purdy, don't make Lewellen go out, he looks so weary. Uncle will send the carriage for us. If it is not at the door, it will be there in a few minutes. See, girl, if it has not al- ready come." - Yres, ma'am, Mr. Terrant's c rriage has been here for some time." ' We are not at all afraid to go in the carriage alone, Mrs. Pur- dy. Henry is a very safe driver, and the horses are so gentle." ' Come back with Mary, Evangeline, and pass the night with us." i "I shall either do this or take'IMary with me. You know aunty is from home now, and I do not remain at home at night without some company." The two young ladies bade Mrs. Purdy good-evening, and, get- ting into the carriage, bade the driver take them to Dr. Hoyt's church. "Shall we go in, Mary, or remain in Ithe carriage until nine?" asked Evangeline. "I do not know what is best. If we can se- cure a back seat, so as to leave unnoticed, I should prefer it to staying without. Would not you?" t"Greatly; but then we must avoid observation. Mr. Plumber has a pew in the back of the church. None of the family are in town. Shall we sit in that?" "Yes, yes, anywhere to be secure from notice." Bidding the driver to remain at the corner of the street until' the services were over, the two girls alighted and entered the church. They found themselves early. As yet but few persons were seated, and the gas was burning at half light, Quietly they   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        333 made their way to Mr. Plumber's pew, where, seating themselves. they drew down their veils, so as almost wholly to shut out the view of their faces. Family by family the congregation came in. until the building was pretty nearly filled. The gas was turned on to a full jet, the organ pealed forth a salutatory as the minister ap- peared in the pulpit, and services commenced. During the singing, the prayer, and the rather lengthy sermon that succeeded them, Evangeline and Mary remained seated like statues draped from view. They dared not turn their faces right nor left, lest they should be recognized by some friend. As the minister concluded his sermon, Evangeline quietly drew forth her watch. It wanted five minutes to nine. We will go," she said to Mary.  As the minister, uplifting his hands, said, "Let us pray," they arose and noiselessly left the house. "Oh, Mary, Mary, if Harry should not come!" said Evangeline, as ,se nervously handed her fiiend into the carriage. "Stay just where you are, Henry, until I' tell you to leave, church is not out yet." She remained standing on the pavement holding open the door of the carriage, her eyes fixed on the dark, grim form of the prison that rose up before her view. "Strange ,contrast," she said, "this close proximity of the house of God, iwhere men assemble to worship Him according to the dictates of their own conscience, and the prison-house, where men made in His own image and born freemen are shut out from society, abused, insulted, merely because they have dared to exercise their reason and express their convictions-dared to enjoy this right that God himself has bestowed on them, and which, all liberal governments guarantee to their meanest subjects. What a shad comment upon mankind, upon the passions to thelbehests of which he yields up conscience and judgment, and which, like the brute creation, he follows as his guide!" "Mary, Mary!" she said excitedly, thrusting her head into the carriage, "some one approaches. I can't see him distinctly, but it looks like Harry."    ^  "Where, where, Evangeline?" replied Mary, springing out and. taking position beside the trembling girl. '"Yonder.- Don't you see somebody in the dim gas-light coming this way? He turned from Green-street. Look, he is crossinI It must be Harry. Oh, Mary!" and Evangeline started hastily forward to meet the approaching figure, and as it neared the pave- ment she ejaculated, "l Harry, Harry!"     334        RAIDS AND ROMANCE The man suddenly stopped, raised his head, and looked inquir- ingly round. Evangeline advanced to the rear of the carriage, and said more softly than at first: -"Harry, Harry! is that you?" Again the figure paused, and peered more earnestly in the direction from whence the sound proceeded. Discovering, in the dim light only a female figure near the carriage in front of him, he lowered his head, and passed quickly on. Evangeline sprang to the door-step, and rushed into the car- riage, exclaiming, "It was not Harry, Mary. Who could it have been? I hope he did not know me." Her voice was harsh, her manner bewildered and agitated. She trembled in every limb, her heart beat audibly. The clock of the cathedral sounded out the hour of nine.       : "Be still, Evangeline; be composed. You have nothing to fear. The man evidently did not recognize you, or he would have made himself known. I do not suppose he heard your words-only your voice arrested his attention. Be calm, we have nothing to fear."  "But if Harry should not come? It is nine-the hour-and he is not here. I shall die, Mary, if I am disappointed. It is my only hope in life. For days I have lived on the expectation of this mnoment. And now, if he should not come--" Just then the organ pealed forth its deep, bass notes. Evan- geline threw her Arms around her friend, and hid her face on her bosom. "Not come-nodt come   Oh, how can I bear it " and she burst into tears. "You must be calm, Evangeline. You will betray us, if you weep that way. It is not too late. Harry's plans may have been delayed. I shall look yet half an hour for him."' '"Oh, will you-do you, Mary?" she sobbed, starting up and gazing into the sweet face bending over her, as if a ray of hope, altogether unlooked for, had that instant found lodgment in her bosom. '"Do you really think, Mary, that this is true? Harry is always so punctual!"I' ' But, Evangeline, Harry is now dependent on circumstances which he cannot master to suit his will and desires. It may be he is watched, or some of the officers of the prison Perhaps are in; or the sentinel with whom he has made the arrangement may not' have yet entered on his duty." 1 "True, true, Mary; I see that a hundred things may prevent his being here at the moment. But church will soon be out. m "   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        335 What shall we do then? Will it not be suspicious for us to remain here in this place without any apparent reason?" "Suppose we drive round the square while the people are leav- ing the church, and then return to this point?" "If Harry should come while we are away, Mary! No, no, I cannot leave. But this we can do," she added, after thinking a moment; "I will remain and keep watch for Harry, while Henry drives you round. I will shield myself in that deep shade yonder, and no one will see me; if they do, I will tell them I am await- ing my carriage. If he should come, and I do not see him, he will doubtless remain until after every one is gone, for he will feel sure I am here." "Tell the driver, Evangeline, to- drive slowly around the square, returning just to this point, but not to set off until the congregation is dismissed."  Evangeline gave the order slowly and emphatically to the boy on the box.       l "Do you understand me, Henry?" "Yes, ma'am," was the reply of the drowsy coachman. A footfall on the pavement. The two girls simultaneously thrust their heads from the carriage window. Breathlessly they awaited the advancing steps. Nearer and nearer they came, until they were distinctly audible just behind the carriage. The girls grasped each other in silence. Neither spoke, as they caught the dim outline {of a man, evidently making his way towards the carriage. He paused near the open door. Evangel- ine leaned out until their faces almost met. Her eyes searched his features by the pale light. It was not Harry, only somli one who had come to escort a wife or sister from church. As shle fell back in the carriage, she pressed Mary's hand convulsively, heaved a heavy sigh, but no word escaped her lips. The audience commenced to leave the church. Evangeline repeated her command to the driver, alighted, quietly closed the door, and sought the deep shade of the building. The carriage drove slowly off. Almost fearing to breathe, lest she might arrest the attention of some one, Evangeline repnained motionless, ensconced in her dark hiding-place. 'Group after group moved off, and she was left alone. She shuddered as she thought of her situation. Dark fears shot through her mind, but she dismissed them in a moment as ill-ornened gists. The sexton extinguished the lights, swung to the ponderfus front doors, locked them, and descending the steps, walked away humming a low air. '       I  -            .  i     336        RAIDS AND ROMANCE They appeared hours, those few minutes of racking uncertainty. ThIe lone, trembling girl, hid away in the deep shaidow of that silent church, experienced the varied emotions of a lfetime, while her throbbing heart pulsated but fleeting moments. Wonder we at that marked stamp of maturity that characterizes the manner and countenance of some young beings who cross our life-path as we journey onward? Ah, the heart doth often write down in its own ineffaceable record the sufferings1 and experience of many years, while the hand but moves in time's great dial-plate. What dread, what apprehension, what doubt, what sinking sor- row, swayed the bosom of Evangeline, as she felt the peril of her position? Not for herself cared she. It was for him whom her soul loved with all the intensity of its passionate, clinging ardor. How unselfish is pure, young love! Ho o ready to immolate itself on the altar of its idol's happiness! Building its own pyre, it  looks gladly up, and rejoices while it reads in the Preparation for its fearful doom the immortality of its own beloved Psyche. To the tear-dimmed eye this earth-is waste and barren, and time and selfish interest eat out the good from mnan's heart as it obdurates under their ossifying touch. But in the fresh, glad spring-time of youth, flowers bud and bloom, and send abroad sweet fragrance, and the whisperings of angels speak to life, in the soul of unsullied innocence, rapturous emotions akin to those that swell the bosoms of celestial beings. The noise of the carriage-wheels moving slowly over the boldered street caught Evangeline'$ eager ear. Uncertain whether it was Mary, she remained under cover of the darkness. She listened attentively. It came tardily on to the corner, turned, and Henry's voice called out, "Whoa, whoa!" She forsook her covert and stepped to the carriage "Not yet, Evangeline?"  l "Not yet, Mary." After a lapse of time she said, "He will not come, Mary. Harry will not come. My heart tells me so. 1 felt itas I stood'yonder beneath that frowning wall." She spoke with the determination of desperation, and the voice so cold, so hollow, fell fearfully on Mary's ear. "Oh, do not despair. It is time yet. Get in the carriage, and we will wait here. There are several minutes yet to half-past nine, and I do not expect him before then." "Don't you, Mary?" asked Evangeline, sadly, as she seated herself in the carriage, hnd leaned her head on Mary's shoulder.    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         337 "Ah me, I fear he will not come," she added hopelessly. "Per- haps-perhaps-" The words died out on her lips. She could not trust herself with speaking the fears that haunted her soul. Twice again during the ten minutes of eager expectation that followed, Evangeline's ear was mocked by the sound of some one coming towards the carriage. Each time she started up, waited until the individual passed by, then fell back with a groan into her original position. Mary's arm stole gently around the languid form. Shl felt how deeply Evangeline needed words of comfort. But how could she, convinced as she now was; that there was no longer hope left, continue to offer words of cheer or consolation? Minute succeeded minute. Oh, how wearily they dragged them- selves across the tortured heart of the expectant girl! The old cathedral clock rung out the hour of ten. Evangeline fell on her friend's bosom and gasped out-'"Too late! too late! he will not come; we must go." Henry was or- dered to diive back to Mrs. Purdy's. More dead than living, yvan- geline lay, every sense benumbed by the weight of disappointment. She did not attempt to speak. She did not move; her low still breathing was scarcely perceptible. Mary took her icy hands in hers and chafed them gently, and smoothed back from the rigid brow the sheet of raven hair. "If Mr. Terrant is awaiting Miss 1Evangeline, tell him she is with me," said Mary to the driver, as she assisted the almost life- less form of Evangeline to ascend the front steps. Supporting her as well as she could, Mary rang the bell; the servant answered tardily. "Assist me up stairs with Miss Evangeline," she said to the girl in a low tone. "Do not make any noise." "Is Miss 'Vangie sick, Miss Mary?" asked the girl, rubbing her sleepy eyes. 'She is not well, Kate. Has Mrs. Plrdy retired?" hOh yes, ma'am, been in bed long time. Missis got such a headache." Noiselessly Evangeline Was conducted along the hall and up the stairway to Mary's room. Reaching it, she threw herself on the bed, but spoke not. "Some fresh water, Kate; ice-water." While the girl prepared the cooler for water, Mary raised the form of Evangeline and took off her hat. She then loosed her clothes and removed her shoes, and rubbed her face and hands. "Here, Evangeline, take this water, it will refresh you ;" and 15     338        RAIDS AND ROMANCE he poured a glass of ice-water fromn the pitcher the girl had brought, and turning into it a tea-spoonful of'sal. volatile, she placed it to Evangeline's lips. She drank, and looking up into Mary's face, whispered, "He did not come, Mary, he did not come."                   ,     I "You can go down now, Kate, Miss Evangeline is better." ".If you need me to-night, Miss Mary, ring the bell, and I'll come;" and the girl placed the water on the washstand and left the room. As the door closed behind the servant, Evangeline sprang up, and throwing her arms about Mary, who sat on the bed beside her, burst into tears. She wept persistently for some time. Her sur- charged heart found relief from its crushing burden, and!after a lapse of time, she said, looking sadly, beseechingly at her friend: i' Oh! tell me, tell me, Mary, why did not Harry come? "'I cannot tell, Evangeline. He could not get out. Perhaps the guard deceived him."  "Yau did not hear any shooting, Mary, did you?" "tnqo, Evangeline; Harry is safe, no doubt." "But in that horrid prison," she responded, shaking her head slowly, and gazing out into the room despairingly. "He said he would come. It was-all arranged, I know it was; he understood all the signs, and answered them all. I wonder why he disap- pointed me?"  "I He could not carry out his plans, Mary; he has been deceived in some way."' "And if he was, discovered they'll put him in irons, Mary, and send him to Camp Chase. Oh! I shall never again see him! never, never!" and again she wept bitterly. Mary endeavored to soothe her, to bid her hope. But how can the heart hope when it is breaking? A thousand reasons presented themselves to the tortured mind of Evangeline, but nothing was satisfactory. Around each sug- gestion gathered doubt, uncertainty, fear. Over all hovered the incubus of disappointed expectation. Throughout the night Mary watched beside her. Sometimes she slept fitfully, at others wept, and then again, with seeming composure, she would converse over her bitter trial. "Could Lasley have thwarted me, Mary?" she asked, as the two lay, at the midnight hour, vainly endeavoring to upravel the mystery. "No, no, Evangeline; it cannot be. What influence has Ed.

But there comes over mea vague feeling at times amounting to conviction, that he is the author of all this." "You do him injustice, Evangie. I am assured he has not pene- tration enough to discover your secret, or ability to overturn your arrangements. No, no; it is not Ed. Lasley that has done this. The guard has either deceived or betrayed Harry. Wait, lEvan- geline, a'few hours may disclose it all." 9 I must wait, Mary. Stern necessity demands it of my break- ing heart. But, oh how dreadful to bear this wasting'anxiety I If Harry is killed or sent away, then life to ne is worthless-I ask not to live." *                 ,.         340        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER LIII. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1862. BRIGHT, beautifully bright, as if the angel of light and glory had spread her pinions over the earth, opened the morning of this day so memorable in the annals of Louisville. And with the uprising of its multitudes of men, came what hopes, what doubts, what fears! During the previous week ditches had been dug and guns mount- ed, so as to circumvallate the city from the river on the east to the river on the west. Thousands of men, impressed into service, had toiled, beside the soldiery, to prepare " defences against the rebels under Bragg." The fears of the near-sighted and unwary had been stilled by this semblance of strength, and many there were who regarded their little treasures as safe from the " vandal foot" of Southrons, as if some genii, in answer to Aladdin's lamp, had transported them to Central Africa. But others-the wise and prudent-knew and felt how little resistance these pits, dug in the very outskirts of the place, would offer to veteran troops deter- mined to secure a foothold in this "Union stronghold." They were not to be misled by this mere show of safety, and fearfully did they open their eyes to the certainty that General Bragg could take Louisville if he desiredl to do so. With such, all was fearful apprehension. At an early hour the streets were thronged with, the unquiet multitude, eager for the morning news. "Bragg had left Mumfordsville, where he had defeated the Fed- erals, captured over 4,000 prisoners with all their accoutrements, and was marching in heavy force towards the city." This was the news that ran from lip to lip-arouSing the hopes of Southern hearts who were panting for deliver nce, and filling with gloom and anxiety the bosoms of Lincoln' supporters. Men were at. work on the intrenchments; regiments were paraded through the thoroughfares to, impress the public with a feeling of security. Forces were constantly being crossed over from Jeffersonville to take position among the defenders-of the city. Officers dashed through the streets on hprseback, all eager in the accomplishment !   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        341 of suitable preparations to meet the enemy. Cannon rattled along, followed by the shouts and yells of boys and darkies. Union flags waved from Union windows. Cavalry, with rushing tramp and clanking swords, swept from point to point. Everywhere the work went on; everywhere were signs of confulsion and fearful looking for danger. Men's hearts failed them as they thought of the coming conflict. l Suddenly the newsl ran through the streetS, "General Nelson ,has issued an order for all the women, children, and non-combat- ants to leave the city." It sped froml tongue to tongue, until it reached the length and breadth of the town. Had there been written on the clear azure above, in characters of living light, the fearful doom of all mankind, darker and more dire panic could not have seized the hearts of mtn and women. What had been pain- fully contingent before was now a most appalling reality. Bragg was at the very gates of the city, and Nelson declared, rather than it should fall into the hands of the rebels, he would fight hand to hand through the streets; and then, if he were compelled to evac- uate and cross to the northern bank of the river, he would plant his guns on the Indiana shore 'and shell it until every house was demolished before the enemy should hold it. Nlelson was known to be a reckless, desperate man, always ready for any rash, un- natural act, and each individual con idered not only his property, but his life, in jeopardy. In less than a half-hour from the first i   faint rumor of the baneful order, every house seemed to have emptied its inmates into the already thronged streets; men, pale and trembling, eagerly asking of every responsible friend they Ilet if the rumor was really true. Women weeping and wringing their hands in agony; children affriglhted, and aroused by that sense of dread and anxiety which the young always feel under excitementj dashed wildly to and fro. Everybody appeared frenzied, de- void of both reason and method.  The order had been issued. Bragg was within a few miles of the city, and the battle would btegin in a few hours. Then came the fearful rush of thousands, eager to escape the dreadful doom of conflict. Every vehicle, from the most superb hack down to the rickety old dray, was impressed into the service of transporting families to a place of refuge. Clothes were hastily thrown into trunks, which trunks were thrown into drays, furniture wagons, omnibuses, carriages, hacks, or whatever vehicle gould be obtained, and driven at pell-mell speed to the wharf. Houses, with every. thing in them turned upside down, were hastily cleared and con- [! e     342        RAIDS AND ROMANCE signed by their fleeing owners to the fate of war. Babes were snatched from the cradle, and, wrapped up in any thing that could afford protection from the chill air of autumn, were pressed to the throbbing bosom of the distracted mother, and borne to one of the boats that stood waiting to convey theem to the opposite shore. The river-bank was thronged with fearful crowds, all anxious to  secure a speedy transit to the opposite side of the Ohio. As each hour passed, rumors became more and more numerous, more and more terrible. "Bragg had whipped Buell's forces and cut them to pieces, and was now halting outside the city, demand- ing its surrender. Dozens of persons had seen his truce-flag borne along the streets; others, who had ascended the roof of the Custom-house, had seen, with the aid of glasses, his whole army only a few miles out, awaiting the return of the flag of truce. As Nelson had sworn he would never surrender, it was believed the city would be immediately attacked, and the expectant ears of the panic-stricken fugitives, as they sped the streets, or lined the wharf, or pursued the various roads that communicated with the country, eagerly listened for the first booming of the death- dealing cannon. Evening came, but brought no attack. Yet the excitementwas Lot one whit abated. Still the stream dontinued to outpour. Everywhere new reports sprang into life, and were caught up by eager listeners and repeated as truths, until to walk one sq are and hear the varied recitals that met you, was to grow bewildered and doubt the truth of all. At one corner you would hear that Bragg had completely anni- hilated Buell's army. At the next corner, you would learn from a source equally as veracious, that Buell had encountered Bragg and routed his army, scattering it in every direction. One would assert as a fact wholly unquestionable, that General Bragg would certainly reach the city that night; another would declare that he knew beyond contradiction that Bragg had but twenty-five tiou- sand men, and that hewould not dare to venture upon the place.  Shops and storehouses of ll descriptions were closed, their alarm- ed owners having fled, leaving behind them every thing that would embarrass their precipitate exodus.' Evening came-yet the frightful rush continued, and when the chill September night fell down over the earth, thousands of' the citizens of Louisville, without any comforts, many destitute! of even a shelter from the night air, were congregated in Jeffer-  sonville, New Albany, and other points on the Indiana shore.   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        343 Many of the more wealthy had gone to Cincinnati and Indianap- opolis; while others, unwilling to attempt to seek safety on free soil, had moved out by every possible means into the nearest towns and the contiguous counties. The prisoners had all been forwarded to Camp Chase, and manyoof the military officials had made full arrangements to depart at the first appearance of necesg sity.  '  Meanwhile, General Bragg was quietly pursuing his way to Bardstown, having diverged from the direct route to Louisville at Hodgenville, some thirty miles from the city. Reaching Bards- town in the forenoon of that memorable day, he halted his weary troops for rest, and immediately sent out detachments of cavalry on all the routes leading towards the city; which lmovemnent being made known, gave rise to the belief that it was his intention to approach by the various roads that led from the vicinity of Bardstown to Louisville; and all who ventured out in that direc- tion expected to meet the heavy columns of triumphant Confeder- ates marching on to the certain capture of the town. It was also believed by many that General Kirby Smiih's forces were advan- cing from Lexington by way of Shelbyville, to form a junction with Bragg, ahd thus simultaneously attack the town from two different points. ' What is the news, Mrs. Purdy?" asked Mary and Evange- line in the same breath, as that lady entered the room heated, flushed, and trembling with affright. ' Oh, tell me, Mrs. Purdy, tell me!" gasped Evangeline, as she started up in1 the bed from which she had not yet risen. It was ten o'clock in the morning, and Mrs. Purdy had just returned from market. Without waiting below to lay aside her bonnet and shawl, she hastened up stairs, sought Mary's room, and disregarding the' ceremony of rapping at the door, entered with an expression of terror on her countenance. Evangeline sat in bed, her hands clasped, and staring up into Mrs. Purdy's face, as if she would read therefrom the dread secret of her alarm. Mary rose and conducted her to the sofa. In interrupted sentences the terrifiedl woman informe'd the girls of the fearful order and the imminent peril of the city.  Not a word of reply was spoken. The three sat in silence, horror-stricken. After a lapse of some moments, Evangeline ex- claimed, "Can this be true, Mrs. Purdy, or is it only a rumor " "True, Evangeline-true, child. I saw Mr. Middleton, who had just returned from the office of the Journal, and he told me     344        RUADS AND ROMANCE that Shipman told him the order had been issued by General Nel- son, and would appear on the bulletin-boards as soon as it could be printed."  And what shall we do-what shall we do?" asked Evangeline, imploringly, springing from the bed to the side of the yet trem- bling woman. Leave, leave-we must leave!" was the-emphatic reply. "And where must we go, Mrs. Purdy?" asked Mary, quickly, as the hope sprung up in her heart of getting to her father. "Anywhere, anywhere, where we will be safe. Hundreds are already on their way to Cincinnati and Indiana." And would you go across the river, Mrs. Purdy W? ould you seek safety in the midst of our enemies?" "I cannot stop now, Mary, to debate differences. To secure the preservation of my own life and the life of my' child is now my first business." "And is the city certainly to be shelled, Mrs. Purdy?" "General Nelson says so." "And what will be done with the prisoners? Are they to be kept shut up to take their chances for life or death ." i "I do not know, Evangeline. I heard no mention of thlem. Perhaps the morning paper says something about it. Here, I have one in my pocket. Didn't have time to look at it. Maybe you will find there what is to be done with them," she said, as she handed the sheet to Evangeline, who took it, and hastily ran her eye up and down the columns. "I must go and pack my trunk, and ie ready to be off as soon as possible. Mary, will you go with lime?' "Where are you going, Mrs. Purdy?" "To my cousins, at Hanover, Indiana. It is the only place where I can go." "'No, Mrs. Purdy, I shall never cross the river to seek for safety. I will die on Kentucky soil first.'" "But I cannot leave you, Mary."    "Oh, don't give yourself a moment's thought about me. I will take care of myself. I am not afraid of the Confederates, if they should come; and if Nelson should be wild enough to try to shell them out, I will go to the country." Youl are not going to trust yourself here, Mary?" said Mrs.  Purdy, in surprise, as she turned from the door to look back upon the heroic girl. 'Stay'here and be killed! You will have no time to get away when the fight is raging everywhere."   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.      i  345 ' "I cannot go to Indiana, Mrs. Purdy. I will not place myself beyond the reach of my brother and father, and all who are my friends. No, no; I'll remain on my native soil, and take the chances. But do not let me interrupt your arrangements. I will go out to Mr. R.'s, and whatever they think best, I will d(o." Mrs. Purdy left the room, wondlering that anybody should stand, at a juncture so critical, upon a question of difference of opinion.  As the door closed, Evangeline ejaculated, "To Camp Chase, Mary, to Camnp Chase!"' "Who, Evangeline-the prisoners?" "Yes-to-day, at twelve o'clock. I must see Harry." ' And are you going to remain here, Evangeline?" "Oh, Mary, Mary, I know not what to do. I am bewildered, my brain reels. My uncle cannot go with me. All the men capa- ble of bearing arms are to be kept for the defence of the city. I cannot go myself. I cannot remain if Harry is taken away. What shall I do-what shall I do?" "Go with me, Evangeline." "' And where will you go, Mary?" "' Through the Confederate lines to my father and brother." "But how will you get through, Mary? Who will go with B  '  you?" "I do not know. There will be some way of escape for me." "But if Harry is to be sent to Camp Chase, I must keep within Federal lines. You know I have no one to rely on, if he cannot escape, but Union friends, who will never go beyond Federal limits. Oh, that Harry had but escaped last night! then would I gladly go with you." The door-bell rang. Evangeline shuddered. "Who or what can that be? The least noise affrights me. My hpart forebodes evil. What if Harry is dead?" "Oh, Evangeline, that cannot be. The morning, paper would have mentioned any occurrence of the kind, and the streets would be filled with it." "Not now, Mary. Every one is-too much engaged looking to his own welfare to regard the fate of another." She had scarcely finished the sentence when the door opened, and Mrs. Spalding entered, trembling, as Mrs. Purdy, with alarm, without waiting to' bid the girls good-morning, said, "I have called, Mary, to take you home with me. The city is to be shelled in an hour, they say. Gt your bonnet on immediately, 15*     346        RAIDS AND ROMANCE and go with me. You will then be beyond present danger. And you, too, Evangie, there is room for you. Why, what is the mat- ter, child, are you sick? you look so pale and worn. Don't be alarmed. There is no possibility of your being. hurt at pa's, unless the battle should be fought out in that direction, and then we would fall further back-go to Bardstown or Lebanon. Dress yourself quickly. The carriage will be here in a few minutes." "Do, Evangeline, go with us, I cannot leave you," said Mary, beseechingly, as she hastened from drawer to wardrobe, and from wardrobe to trunk, gathering up a few needed articles of clothing. Evangeline buried her face in her hands, and remained silent. Then looking up, she said, "No, no, I cannot go. I remain here." "Stay in the city, Evangeline, and it being shelled I Why this is folly-rashness. You must go with me-must go. There is no choice left. Your aunt is away. Your uncle will not be permit- ted to leave. You cannot go alone-to remain here is impossible. You must go with me. I cannot leave you here. Come, get on your dress, we have no time to lose, the fight may begin at any hour. Hush! I vasn't that the report of cannon?" and Mrs. Spald- ing sprang to the window, and hastily throwing it up, listened with trembling fear. A few moments more, and again the report of cannon sounded out on the air.  "It is-it is!" she exclaimed, springing back, her eyes starting from their sockets. "It is cannonading, perhaps the conflict has already begun. Evangeline, Evangeline! do come. Oh, do-in a moment. Don't sit there. See, Mary is almost ready. And Mrs. Purdy has her trunk packed, and has sent out for a carriage to take iher to the boat. Dress, dress, or you will be too late." "I cannot go, Lu. Oh! I cannot," she said, emphatically. "I must stay with my uncle." "Stay with your uncle, Evangeline! What good can you do? You only endanger your own life. General Nelson says all the women and children must leave the city. It will be shelled, and if necessary, to prevent its falling into our hands, shall be burnt. Come, there is Mr. Spalding. Get up, get up, and dress yonr- self." "Oh, 1Evangie, do go," said Mary, throwing her arms about the neck of the pale, wan girl. "Do go, Evangie. It is of no- avail for you to stay here. The matter cannot be altered. We must submit." Evangeline looked up at her friend. Her eyes were red with   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN1.        347 the weeping of the past night, and on her face there rested a sad and anxious expression. But her compressed lips, and the fixed look of those expressive black eyes, told all too plainly of her re- solved purpose. "Do not ask me, Mary. I must remain here. You know my reasons. I should be miserable in Confederate lines, where I could hear nqthing, and life is not worth preserving now. I can- not go." "But what will you do, Evangeline?" Oh, I cannot tell. There will be some way opened for me." "But I cannot leave you so." "Yes, Mary, you must. Do not delay a moment for me. Al- ready you may be endangered. Go, go, and leave me. I will take care of myself." "But you will not remain herte. Mrs. Purdy will be off in a short time, and the house will be closed." "No, no, I shall go directly home. From there to the prison and the boat," she whispered. "I may perchance see him once more." Mary threw her arms about her neck and burst into tears. Oh, Evangie, we may never meet again. Good-by," and she kissed her again and again.  Evangeline spoke not. The tears gushed from her eyes. She strained Mary to her heart, and imprinted a farewell kiss upon her lips, and the two parted-to meet no more. Mrs. Spalding bade her good-by. The two left the room, and gaining the carriage, drove rapidly out to the country. Evangeline dressed herself mechanically, and walked home. She found her uncle gone, and all the 'servants, save the cook, out on the street to hear the news. The clock struck eleven. "One hour more, and he goes from me forever, Once in that horrid prison, and he will never come out again," she said to her- self, mournfully, as she closed the door of her room, and set out alone, to catch, if possible, one more glimpse of the beloved form. She drew her veil closely over her face, and proceeded in the direction of the prison. Everywhere met her eyes evidences of the terrible panic that had seized the people. The streets were thronged with vehicles carrying away women, and children, and baggage. The side-walks were crowded with themoving masses, jostling against each other, as each rushed along in pursuit of his own particular phantom.  Quickly, quietly, she threaded her way along the streets, regard- :                              A      348        RAIDS AND ROMANCE ing nothing but her own safety from the danger of being thrown down. Her mind was filled with the one dread thought, that of not seeing Harry before he left. As she neared the prison, she saw a great crowd around the gateway. Men were moving about as if some consternation had befallen them, and I on lifting her veil to endeavor to ascertain the cause of the commotion, she saw several soldiers pass in and through the dense mass. "They are taking the prisoners away," she said, and with one bound she pressed forward and forced herself on the corner of the pavement by which they must pass on their way to the river. Almost ready to faint with emotion, she maintained her position as well as she could amid the surging movements of the ever- changing throng. She could not see the door of the prison, nor the great gate guarded by its sentinels. Throwing her thick veil aside, and shielding her face from; the peering curiosity of the passer-by as well as she could with her hand, she looked up over the heads of the people to the'prison windows. A few forms stood before them. Her heart bounded as she fancied she caught a glimpse of Harry. She looked again-the form was gone. Ea- gerly she strained her eyes upward, each moment hoping he would reappear. "What's going on here V" asked one man of another, as the two met on Ithe pavement near where Evangeline was standing be- side another female, like herself, closely veiled. m Going to take the rebel prisoners to Camp Clhase. Are afraid Bragg will get them." "Pshaw! heth never come here. Buell will cut him all to pieces, and send his starving, naked vandals flying back to Dixie." 1 Not so sure of that, Mr. Duncan. Things look mighty doubt, ful now, I tell you. The order of Nelson means a great deal. Desperate struggle ahead.":  "Desperate struggle, Mr. McAllister! Why, you don't think so, do you? Why, the starving, naked, cowardly Southerners won't fight. They haven't got any arms to fight with. Some old flint-lock guns, and now and then a man -with a squirrel rifle. What can such a people do? Our men can whip them out in an hour and not half try. ' Don't feel so certain about that," said the old man, looking searchingly. into his friend's face to see if he was not quizzing . him. "Don't feel certain-not at all certain, sir. I used to be- lieve these tales about these rebels being starved and naked, and. having no guns; but'I tell you, sir, when they are right here i         .    -   OF MORGAN AMD HS IlEN.        349 ready to Ioverrun us, and we have got so many men, it looks mighty strange, sir.

R"But Prentice tells you not to fear, they are nothing but a handful of men, made desperate because they have got no bread and bacon; and he is good authority, sir."      . "Confound old Prentice. I used to believe all-he said. But I tell you, sir, he's lied about these rebels. Needn't tell me any longer they are cowards, when they stand right here threatening this city. All a mistake, sir, all a misthake. They've got plenty of spunk. I've been down South, and I know what they are. Prentice needn't tell me they won't fight." "Oh, but Buell will whip them out. Don't be alarmed. He will manage therm." j Not so sure of that either, sir. He didn't manage them down in Tennessee. I don't see thow he's going to do it now--they've got the start of him. Mighty fearful Bragg will ruin him, and then pounce down on us, and ruin us. Needn't tell me, Mr1. Dun- can. You're a Southern man, and I doh't believe a word you've said. You are only laughing at me. You Southern men are all in fine spirits. Not one of you but what can laugh over this mat- ter, serious as it i'." "I'm only telling you, Mr. McAllister, what Prentice says. "I thought he was the cream eof all wisdom and truth. As to what I believe, that's a matter of smlall- moment; it can't possibly affect the issue either way." "Are you going to leave Louisville, Mr. Duncan ; I mean your I family?" 'l No, sir; we have decided to remain and take the shelling." , "Yes, that's the way with you rebels; ,you all believe Bragg's coming. Not one of you is going to budge an inch; this tells the tale. YOu all think Bragg will be here in a few hourq  Well, well, it may be so. Good-by; I may never see you again, for if the rebels do come, I, for one, will' leave; I shan't fall into their hands." The two bade each other farewell and parted. Evangeline had listened attentively to this little bj-chat. Sihe would fain Catch at any promise of hope, however vague and un- certain. Could the Southerners reach the city before the prisoners were sent away, Harry would be saved.   Or could there even spring up an uncontrollable excitement, -it would offer some hope of deliverance. As these thoughts were passing. through her mind, her eys were seeking the open window, desirous to catch one view of Harry.     350        RAIDs  AND ROMANCE Two men encountered each other on the paveinent on her left. Their words, though spoken in an ordinary voice, reached her ear. "What's all this, going on here?" asked one of the other. "Going to take the rebel prisoners across tie river; afraid Bragg will get them here." "Al, yes, yes. One of them attempted to escape last night, 1 believe, didn't he?" remarked the elder of' the two to the otler. The speaker was an old man, with white hair, sunken blue/ eyes, and thin pale face. He. leaned on his cane as he walked along, being stooped in the shoulders. "Did he, indeed? I had not heard of it," was the quick, ner- vous reply of the younger gentleman. "Yes-one of Morgan's men; they are perfect dare-devils, you know." "And did he succeed?"Evangeline's- ready ear had caught the words of the speaker. She stepped forward; to the front of the pavement, the better to hear the thrilling conversation. "I heard that-"The old gentleman had proceeded thus far with his reply, when a rough, brawny man knocked up against Evangeline, almost dashing her down. She lost the lst words of the answer, for before she could recover herself the gentlemen were bidding each other " good-morning." Amazed, distracted at the uncertainty in which she found her- self, she looked round to see which way the elderly gentleman had proceeded. Her strong impulse was to follow him, but he was lost to her vision amid the throng. Turning to the veiled female. who stood near her, who she hoped might hlave heard the old gentleman's answer, she asked timidly: "Did you hear whether one of Morgan's men escaped from the prison last night?"  "No.!" said the girl, astonishment evident in her tone. "Did one get out?" "I heard something said about one of them attempting to escape." I I do hope he succeeded," the female replied, without raising her veil, only turning her face to Evangeline. "I wonder who it was.        I       ; ' "I did not hear his name. Are there more tlan one of Morgan's men there?"  "Oh, yes; several. I have an acquaintance in prison, young Roberts, who is one of his men.",  At the mention of this name, Evangeline started. Did she know   )I     O OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.       351 Ithe female standing beside her? Did the lady recognize her? No, else she would have assuredly addressed her by nane. "The prisoners go to Cincinnati to-day," said Evangeline, her curiosity excited, and desiring to prolong the conversation, hoping to hear something that would throw light on Harry's dark fate. "Yes,' at twelve o'clock. I have an uncle, from Owen county, among the number, and I am waiting here to see him as he passes. Poor old man! he has been in prison for a month; and his health is so feeble. I went to see him last Thursday, and lie looked so pale and thin; he can't live long in Camp Chase. Have you a friend here?" she said, extending a look of anxious inquiry upon Evangeline. ' Yes," saiEvangeline, averting her head as she felt the blood rising to her cheeks. The crowd gave way, and the prisoners, under strong guard, marched from the gateway to the middle of the street and formed in line. Evangeline, from where she stood, could only catch a view  of the two who were in front. She scanned their features closely as they stood with bold defiant air bent on the gazing gaping as- semblage that lined the sidewalk on either hand. A few minutes and the last one had fallen into the,ranks. Then came the order, "'March!" With elastic step and stern unyielding front, the head of the column reached Fifth and turned out to- g  wards the river. Scrutinizingly Evangeline searched each face. Pair by pair went on, but Harry was not of them. "He must have escaped," said Evangeline to herself, beginning to feel the risings of hope in her bosom. "Strange I should not have heard it; but perhaps he had no time-had to flee to the country." She was solacing her heart with this thought, when she heard a' voice say "Good-by, good-by." Instantly she pressed nearer to -the passing column. It was the old uncle addressing his niee, who had thrown up her veil so as to be recognized, and who ly a signal had attracted the attention of the old man.- , Scarcely had the young girl recovered from the shock this sud- den surprise, had given her, when she heard her own name pr'o- nounced in tones all too familiar. Harry had seen her, knew her, and had pronounced her name as he passed rapidly by. "Harry!" was the only response of the excited girl, as she saw the young man in advance of where she stood. "Come, go with me to the boat," she said to the female beside her, " we shall see our friends there-it will be the last titme;" and she seized the arm of the woman convulsively, who, without time     352        RAIDS AND EOMANCE to reflect, yielded without remonstrance, and the two set out with the running mass to follow the prisoners. "Nobody will notice us," said Evangeline, feeling that perhaps the woman might have solne reluctance to accompanying her in this strange and sulnmary nmanner. "The whole city is in an up- roar to-day they will think we are endeavoring to flee." The female allowed herself to be led along. "Cvome quickly, we must pass them and reach the boat first. See! it wants only fifteen minutes of the time. We will not get to see." Pressing on through the moving tide of human beings that crowded every street, Evangeline and her friend succeeded in gain- ing the wharf in advance of the prisoners, Selecting a position by which the men must pass as they filed on board the boat, which already awaited them, they paused until the column, the front of which was already in view, should reach them. A moment, and the advance had passed. Riveted to the spot, Evangeline gazed on each passing form, until her eyes rested on Harry. Just as he reached her, the column was ordered to halt. o "Harry," she said, as she rushed to his side, L why didn't you come 2" "The guard, Evangeline-the guard deceived ime." "And can't you get away, dear Harry?" she whispered low, as she saw the soldiers nearing the spot where she was.  Impossible-impossible! I will try at Cincinnati. If I don't succeed there, I will surely get Away from Camp Chase." "Oh, Harry-" "Don't be distressed, Evangeline," broke in the prisoner, as lie saw the look of hopeless despair that gathered on the sad face of Evangeline. "A few weeks more, perhaps a few days, and I shall be in Kentucky again. Tell my father, Evangeline, what I say, but breathe it to none other." The young girl regarded her lover with amazement,-so calm, so cheerful, o hopeful, while she saw nothing but distress and suf- fering: she (ould notjrealize that the scene before her was reality. ' Bragg wrill be here in a day or two, Evangeline, then you will have freedom, and we shall meet again. Rest assured I shall get out, and the Confederates will hold the State." "God grant it, Harry! but, oh, my heart fears. Harry, you don't know what I have suffered since you have been in that prison." "I know, Evangeline. It is hard to bear, but these are times of trial, and we must not shrink from suffering. God shield you :                    z   O   MORGAN AND HIS MEN. )          -s from all harm. Be/brave, never yield, Evangeline. We will meet again." The order was given to advance. Harry grasped the hand of the young girl, looked upon her withi an expression so full of love, that, as sad as it was to Evangeline's heart, it thrilled it with glad emotion. And with a "God bldss you, my dear girl, I'll write you soon," he followed on. Once he turned to look back; Evangeline's eyes were fixed upon hiln, and there she remained gazing, gazing,: until he mounted the steps to the boat, where, apart from the rest, he stood to bid her a last adieu. She returned his salutation; then tearing herself away, she leaned on the arm of her yet un- known friend, and ascended the slope that led from the river to Main-street, from whence she found her way with slow and pen- sive step to her now 'desolate home. In her own room, apart from all society, she remained engaged with her own plans and thoughts throughout the remainder of that eventful day.     354        RAIDS AND ROMANCE CHAPTER   LIV. (           LEXINGTON-LOUISVILLE. WHEN, on the morning of the 4th of September, the Confed- erate army, under General Kirby Smith, consisting of the divis- ions of Generals Claiborne and Heath, and two brigades, one frotn Texas, the other from Arkansas, commanded by General Ohurch- ill, marched into Lexilgton and through its' streets, it was every- where received with the loudest attestations of sympathy and welcome. The streets were thronged with thousands of men, women, and'children, waving red and blue ribbons, small flags, handkerchiefs, and who witth smiles and tears hailed with joyous acclaim the presence of the men who had come to deliver them from the presence of the insolent oppressor. Windows and galler- ies-indeed, all available points-were filled with delighted spec- tators, who appeared to rival each other ill their manifestations of gratitude and happiness. It was a glad scene--one well calculated to cheer the hearts of these toil-worn soldiers. Everywhere substantial evidences, in the way of baskets of provisions, and buckets of cool refreshing water, met the hungry, thirsty men, hundreds of whom were, in addition to this, presented with shoes, blankets, hats, overcoats, and tobacco. Their passage through the town was a grand ova- tion. Never did Roman eimperor, on returning fromn the scene of victorious conflict, laden with the spoils of triumph, meet IWith mnore enthusiastic welcome than did those weary, battle-stained men, who had endured every hardship, overcome every obstacle, surmounted every difficulty, that Kentucky might be free. All thanks to tlhem. Let their names be perpetuated in all future history as heroes who darede and suffered, Fnd bled for the right. But if the reception of the infantry was enthlusiastic, what shall we say of that of Colonel AMorgan and his lnen, who now, for tlhe first time in ten long months of toil and daiger, returned to the homes of their childhood, the bosom of thlei loved families? The scene was one which utterly defies description. The bells through- out the city pealed out joyously--men, women, and young boys   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         355 and girls, with smiles, tears, shouts, and cheers rushed into the streets, waving white handkerchiefs and small Southern flags, and mnaking the very air resonant with the strains of wildest joy. Wives pressed husbands to their bosoms; parents clasped sons in affectionate e-mbrace. General gladness reigned throughout the vast multitude, and for hours the most intense excitement every- where prevailed. No class was exempt. Even the negroes were eager participants in the universal enjoyment. Colonel Morgan's forces were allowed but a short time to recu- perate  But during this brief interval, the boys, forgetting all they had endured, gave themselves up unrestrainedly to the joys of home and society. They visited their sweethearts, went riding with old friends, dashed out into the country, and were toasted, feted, welcomed, everywhere. A detachment of Colonel Morgan's forces was thenent forward northward as far as the five-mile house, in front of Covington, where for three days they menaced the enemy, driving up in front of his hastily constructed rifle-pits. Falling back from this point, they returned to Georgetown, and from there passed hastily on, with the view of intercepting the Federal General Morgan, in his retreat from Cumberland Gap. The Friday following General Bragg's occupation of Bardstown and the issuance of the Federal General Nelson's order for the women and children to leave Louisville, General Buell reached the city with his,worn'and jaded army, and assumed command of th' place. This restored confidence to'a great extent, as he was re- garded lqy both parties as a wise and prudent man, who would not unnecessarily bring fear and suffering on the inhabitants. A week from the date of General Nelson's order, he lay a corpse at the Galt House, having been shot by Jeff. C. Davies, of Indiana, in an altercation provoked by himse F/ Troops were hourly pouring into tihe city from across the iver, to swell the already heavy army of Buell. The fortifications were also being strengthened in every possible way, and the:panic which for; days. had reigned universally was but little abated. During all these days of internal suspense, General Bragg was quietly resting at ' Bardstown, seemingly awaiting the development of General Buell's plans. His advance pickets had been thrown forward to within a few miles,of Louisville, and thus the city was constantly menaced. Evangeline Lenoir was aroused early on the Saturday morning following her farewell to Harry Roberts, by a messenger bearing the following note:                i'     856        RAIDS AND ROMANCE "OUISVILLE, KY., Sept. 28, 1862. MY DEAR EVANGELINE:-I have escaped from my captors, and am now safe at my father's house. Were it not for the fear ot betrayal, I would call to see you. But my recent sad experience makes me cautious. I shall leave before morning, to endeavor to make my way through to Lexington, to rejoin Colonel Morgan. Dare I ask you-Will you follow me? Will you forsake hone and friends, Evangeline, for one who loves you more than life itself, and who will do all a devoted lea-t can do to secure your happiness? Once in the land of Freed4mi, we could be united, happy. As it is, we may never meet again. Say, Evangeline, will you meet me at Lexington? I can write no Iorb. Ever, my dear Evangeline, yours, HARRY. Evangeline stood as one electrified, wlile she read ard re-read the note sl e held in her hand. As the breakingl of the morning light to the weary pilgrim, who amid storm and darkness lias wandered on through the tangled inaze of khe trackless wild, was this joyous intelligence to the heart of /pvangeline. Since the morning she had bidden Harry adieu, as the boat left the wharf, she had sorrowed hopelessly. All joy had fled her darkened soul -all hope died out in her stricken bosom. Confining herself to her room, avoiding all company, she brooded over her deep griet and bitter disappointment until her brain was fvenzied, and life became a weary burden. The wild excitement which prevailed throughout the city failed to Win her attention for a moment ; and when at table Mr. Terrant would rally her over her silent and despondent appearance, she would only smile faintly, and reply that nothing distressed her but the dreadful condition of the coun- try. Her uncle, unsuspecting man as he was, ascribed her gloom to her disapp'ointment at her delayed marriage with young Lasley. This gentleman, fearful of being pressed into the ranks of the "refugee defenders" of the city, lhad wisely availed himself of the furore o9 Monday to return to his home at Bardstown. He re- mained in Louisville long enough to see his hated rival conveyed to the blat which was to bear him to Ohio. Then, as if satisfied that he was avenged, he hired a buggy and set off at full speed tor a place of security. "I will go," said Evangeline, determinedly, to herself, as she read again Harry's earnest request. A thousand obstacles rose up to prevent the execution of her design, but she heeded them not. I                    I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         357 Undaunted she looked at them, and where she could not devise a plan to surmount them, she left the difficulty unsolved, and trusted herself to some unforeseen interposition in her behalf. After breakfast, she ordered the carriage, and drove out to Mr. R.'s, to see lary Lawrence. As soon as she found an opportunity to speak with her alone, she showed her Harry's note, told her of her decision, and requested her advice. "We will go together, Evangie," said Mary. "And when shall this be?" asked Evangeline, earnestly. "Just as soon as it is ascertained that the Confederates are going to leave the State. There is still a hope that they may come to Louisville, and the strong possibility is they will hold Kentucky. The difficulties of getting through are so great, we will not risk the trip until it becomes necessary."  "But, oh, Mary, what if the army should go out, and we be left behind?" "That can scarcely occur, Evangie. We shall, most undoubt- edly, have some warning-sufficient to enable us to prepare and get through." "Qave you spoken to any friend, Mary, of your intention to go to Lexington?" "Oh, yes." "And do they approve this plan you have just mentioned?" "Yes; it is the advice of all my friends. . This is why I have adopted it."  "And you will let me know, Mary, when you determine to go? I nmust make some preparations, and I will attend to it immediate- ly, so as to be ready at a moment's warning. But how shall we go, Mary?" "In a carriage. There is left to us no other alternative. All the railroads are broken up, and no stages are running now on any of the old routes. We can hire a carriage for the trip, and go by way of Bardstown. I have an aunt there, and a cousin who will go through with us and protect us."  "But who will take care of us to that place, Mary?" "Lu's brother can go with us. I know the way well, have travelled it often, and would notfeel the least afraid." Evangeline, having Arranged the whole plan with her friend, returned to the city to make such preparation as she thought necessary for the trip before her. On reaching her room, she found a letter on her table from her iaunt. It was directed to Mr. Terrant, and in a handwriting she     358        RAIDS AND ROMANCE d did not recognize. Seizing it, she read it hastily tlhrough. It was an urgent request for Mr. Terrant and bherself to set out irn- mediately for Indianapolis to see her aunt, wlho was confined to her bed, seriously disabled by a fall she had received in descend- ing the steps of a hall where she had been in attendance to hear a war speech. The appeal was mnost forcible, the language setting forth the extent of the sad accident, and Mrs. Terrant's most earnest desire to see her husband and niece. Lookingagain at the table, Evangeline discerned a note which had fallen on the carpet. It was addressed to her by her uncle, telling her that he would make every preparation to leave on the evening train for Indian- apolis, and she must be ready to accompany him. "I cannot go," soliloquized Evangeline, as she throw herself into the large arm-chair that stood before the bright coal-fire that was blazing in the grate. "I cannot go, and it is no use to talk about it. The Confederates may leave the State Whhile I am away, and then I should never get Soucth, and Harry would think I had deceived him, and Lasley will annoy me to death with his importunities; not that he loves me--no, no-the creature is incapable of love--but he is determined to marry me, merely-be- cause he cannot bear to be disappointed in hs desires. Poor, dear aunt, I do wish I could see her,-she has always been so kind to me; and now she is away from home, and suffering so, too. I ought to go. It will be so ungrateful in me to refuse, when she is so anxious to see me. She knows I can nurse her better than any one else. And what reason can I give for stay- ing at home? I have none. Oh, I will have to go!' she added, after a pause; " and then if the Southerners should go out before I can get back, what shall I do--what shall I do! I can't stay long. But how am I to get back? It will not do to leave her until she is well-this would be so unkind. Oh, me, what shlall I do! I cannot go. But what reason can I offer uncle for re- fusing? I cannot tell him I am sick, though mercy knows I have suffered enough in the last week to kill me. I dare not say I am afraid to go, for that is a place of safety-this of danger. And to urge any dislike to the Yankees, when my poor aunt needs me I Oh, that I was ready to set out for Lexington this very hour! I would run all risks, take all consequences, if I could but get through. The world might say what it could, it could not harm me then." She took up the letter that had been lying on her lap during her soliloquy, and read it again. "I shall have to go to poor, I II    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.       359 dear aunt. I would never forgive myself if she should die and I not see her. I will stay asfw days, and then come back. But how can I get away? Aunt will think so strangely of my wish- ing to return before she is well. I must go, and I must return in a few days," she said, energetically, as she arose and walked to the window. The carriage istood waiting to take her down the street. Paus- ing a moment to consider, she took her escritoir, wrote a note to Mary Lawrence, explanatory of circumstances, and urging upon her to write to her at Indianapolis each day, that she might be ; kept informed of what was passing, and of the unfolding of her plans. Then ringing the bell, she ordered Emily to put her / clothes in her trunk, and have every thing ready for her depart- I ure.     i "My small trunk, Emily. I shall be back in a few days. Put up such dresses as are suitable for a sick-room. I shall have no use for evening and dinner dresses, only wrappers and one or two street suits. Be careful, Emily, heed what I say to you." jWith these directions, Evangeline descended the stairway, and taking the carriage drove, to one of the most extensive stores on Fourtt-street. Alighting, she made such purchases as she de- sired, and -ordering the packages done up directly, -took them with her to her mantua-maker, where she left directions for the making of the dresses, requesting that they should be finished by the middle of the following week and sent home. From the mantua- maker's she drove to Merriman's cloak-store, and quickly selected a very genteel drab cloth travelling-cloak. She then proceeded to her milliner's, ordered a travelling-bonnet, and calling at Mrs. Ritchy's fancy-store, purchased gloves, collars, handkerchiefs, etc., etc. Having bought all she deemed necessary, shretup ed home, and occupied the time  until dinner in preparing her travelling trunk, so that she might be ready on her return to set out for the Confederate lines at an hour's warning. As she placed in the last articles, including her morning purchases, she told Emily to be sure to fold the dresses which would be sent home Wednesday. evenirg of the following week, and put them in the trunk. "Going to travel again, Miss 'Vangie?" "Perhaps so, Emily," she replied, carelessly. "I may be I   I shall have to send for my trunk. I  wish to have all things ready." ; "Yes, Miss 'Vangie, you are very right. These troublesome times it's well to be ready for any thing that turns up."     360        RAIDS AND ROMANCE The evening found her with her uncle, on their way to Indian- apolis. On reaching that city, they found Mrs. Terrant far bet- ter than was expected. The injury, which at thil time of the fall had appeared quite serious, upon further examination had been found to be comparatively slight, and the physician assured 'Mr. Terrant that his wife would be in a condition to return home in eight or ten days. On the fifth evening after Evangeline's arrival in Indianapolis, she received a hasty note from Man y Lawrence, infoirming her that she had decided to leave for Bardstown the following week, and urged upon Evangeline to return immediately. "What shall I do!" exclaimed Evangeline to herself, as the hand that held the letter fell heavily on her lap. "Aunt cannot travel yet; uncle is gone, there is no one to accompany me. What shall I plead as an excuse for returning so soon? and how can I persuade aunt to let me go alone? I must go-rthis I am deter- 'mined on, and must leave on the next train. If I delay, Mary may leave without me, and then all hope of getting South is gone- forever gone." Rising from her chair, she passed into her aunt's * room and stood beside the large cushionedclair on which that lady was sitting. She bore the letter in her hand. "What news from Louisville, 'Vangie?" asked her aunt, looking up and seeing the letter. t' Oh, nothing unusual in a military point, aunty. This note is from Mary Lawrence, who urges me to return immediately." Evangeline hushed down her feelings, resolving to be calm. She had a part to play; she must do it well, or all would be lost. "And what is the matter, Evangie, that Mary should request you to returnwat a time like this?" "c Some affair of her own, aunty. PYou know I must not betray confidence," and the gay girl laughed and blushed deeply. "Ah, you need not try to deceive me, child. Mary Lawrence is going to be married to Fred. Morton. Well, well, that is all right. If she ever intends to marry him shb ought to do it now. Then, if he should be wounded, she can wait on him; or if killed, she will have a right to pmourn for him. But you cannot go, Evangie, for several days. You know it is impossible for me to accompany you now, and you cannot go alone. When is the wedding to be?" Evangeline hesitated a moment. Should she continue to deceivei her aunt, or, undeceiving her, depend upon her powers of persua- sion to influence her to let her undertake the trip alone? Intui- tively, fqr she had not time to reason, she concluded to let her    ' OF MORGAN ANBD HS MEN.    . 361 aunt enjoy her own opinion, and looking at the letter again, she answered: "She says not a word about the day; only urges me to come imlmediately, not to delay a moment." "But how are you to go, Evangeline? It is impossible. She had better be married without you than for you to risk yourself alone, now that the country is so filled with soldiers travelling to and frio. Write to her and tell her you cannot come for a few days. As soon as I get well enough, I will go with you. Perhaps the case is not so urgent as she represents it'; and, moreover, if she is to be married in, a day or two she can do without you; it will be a small wedding, of course-very few present." "Oh, aunty," said Evangeline most peosuasively, "I do wish you could go wlith me; don't you feel well enough? You know you can be still when you get on the cars; I will attend to you and the baggage; you shall have no occasion to exert yourself at all. I am so anxious to go. You know Mary is one of my dear- est 'friends, and she has no sister, and no mother, aunty. She is so alone iin the world, I must go to her now; she would never forgive me if I did not."  "Let me see the letter, child. Does she give no reason why she wishes you to come right away?" "Oh, it is marked secret, aunty," replied Evangeline, her color deepening. "Mary wishes me to show the letter to noone, but says come without delay. Can't you go, aunty? Here is Doctor Floss coming up the avenue-if he says you may go with me, won't you go this very morning?" "Oh, my child, I cannot; even were I well enough, and I know I am not, I could not get ready this evening." Dr. Floss entered the room. Evangeline made known her desire. What do you say, doctor?" she asked eagerly. "Can't aunty go with me? she is well enough for the trip, isn't she?"The old man shook his head-"Not for several days will your aunt be in a con- dition to travel." Well, aunty, I will go this evening, and send uncle after you," she said most determinedly, though her heart beat doubtingly as she spoke.  "I am not a bit afraid; and if I were, I would feel it my duty to risk every thing to gratify Wary." "What do you think, doctor-willZ/be prudent for my niece to go to Kentucky alone in these troubus 'times?" The old man, who had been raised' in Connecticut, where females travel unprotected, looked at the matter/in abusiness-like 16  362   ,     RAIDS AND ROMANCE view entirely, got for a moment considering it in the light of pro- priety. "u I think she might go safely, madam, if she is willing to under- take the trip." "Thank you, doctor, thank you," exclaimed Evangeline. "Dr. Floss knows there is no danger, aunty; and you know I am not one bit afraid. How long before the cars leave for Louisville, doc- 'tor? will I have time to get ready?" ' Just two hours before the western train will be in," said the old man, taking out his double-cased silver watch, which had measured the time for him the last twenty years of his practice. "Oh, I could get ready for a trip to Europe in two hours. Aunty, may I go? I know you will not deny me. Doctor, won't you take me to the cars and see my baggage safely on them? I shall have nothing to do but be quiet until I reach home." The doctor readily assented to acting as her1 escort. Her aunt protested against the undertaking, but Evangeline had too much at stake to submit to any opposition. Most wonderfully preserving her equanimity, she made all necessary preparations, and when Dr. Floss drove up at the appointed hour, she was ready, bonneted, awaiting him. Bidding her aunt an affectionate farewell, and enjoining her to come home as soon as possible, she seated herself beside the doctor, who drove her to the depot and placed her on the cars, attending to every minutiae that would enhance her com- fort. In the excitement of achieving her purpose, Evangeline had had no time for reflection or reason. She could entertain but the one thought, that of reaching Louisville in time to set out with Mary Lawrence for Lexington. When alone, as she was, left to her own reflections, the momentousness of the step she was taking rushed in upon her mind with overwhelming power, and she shrunk as the picture in all its grand and fearful proportions rose up before her. Tremblingly she contemplated it, and as she ex- amined it in all its shades and colorings, she stood back aghast at the magnitude of its gigantic dimensions. Should she succeed? this was the momentous question. Once the wife of Harry Rob- erts, she defied the sneers and jests of the unappreciative public. She could look down from the heights of her security and laugh at those who would endeavor to assail her. But, then, tlha fearful opposite! Should she fail in her attempt, and her plans and futile endeavors be exposed to the cold, heartless world! How could             OOF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        363 she live beneath its power? how submit to its coarse remarks and unfeeling opinions? She felt that her proud, independent spirit could never brook this deep trial--this sad, enduring mortifica- tion, which must ever haunt her life. Poor, tried Evangeline! Thou art, indeed, entering in upon a path beset with trial and danger I     364        RAIDS AND ROMANCE I  I  I  - I CHAPTER LV. IS THERE NO LIGHT? THE morning after Evangeline reached Louisville, she drove out to Mr. R.'s, to ascertain when Mary Lawrence would leave for Lex- ington. She found her young friend in the midst of preparation, but foiled in the plan which she had hoped to consummate on the following day. She was now uncertain wohen she should leave. This gave Evangeline more time to perfectlher arrangements, and although it but prolonged the suspense which she felt almost un- endurable, yet, for some reasons, she was glad of the delay. Ap-  plying herself with the utmost assiduity to the task before her, unadvised and unassisted, she succeeded, in a few days, in com- pleting all arrangements deemed by her necessary-for the proposed trip; Her trunk was conveyed to Mr. R.'s, to await the day of departure. Her uncle, all unsuspecting, furnished her with what funds she desired, and with miser's care she hoarded them, that she might be ready to meet future exigencies. Meanwhile she re- ceived no intelligence from young Lasley. She had' expected to be annoyed by the reception of letters, or' perhaps the intrusion of his presence. Why he was thus' silent she was at a loss to di- vine, but, amid her wonder, she was grateful to be relieved of this feature of her perplexity. Ahl could she have known what that silence portended-could she )have read the secret workings of that heart, bent on its ever fiendish purposes--have understood its act of cruel revenge-how would her soul have sunk within her! how would she have fainted beneath the torturing burden! Anguish, deep, dark, unutterable, would have seized the very life- springs of her being, and she would have sought death rather than life! Robbdl of joy-her every hope perished-Lthe light of the future changed to rayless darkness-what would there have been upon which the weary soul could have leaned for support .? what to which the poor broken heart could have looked for consola- tion? Well it was for her, surrounded as she was by uncertainty, her bosom each moment the prey of doubt and anxiety, that the sad intelligence could not reach her. Well, that while the cloud   :- ...OF MORGA N AND HS MEN.                  365 gathered over her pathway, she saw not its black folds--heard not its fearful thunders! Incarcerated in the! prison at Bardstown, shut out from the light of day, surrounded by a Federal guard, with the penalty of death overshadowing his soul, lay Harry Roberts, hopeless, sad, despair- ing. It was the 8th of October, the d6y of the sanguinary battle of Perryville. - He knew not of the conflict that was then raging, all- he knew was the wretchedness of his condition-the utter hopelessness of his future. And for the first time amid the varied fortunes that had beset his path for the last twelvemonth, did he despair. He thought of Evangeline, of his request, with which he felt confident she would endeavor to comply; of her endeavors to join him, her hopes, her fears, the risks she would run, and then of her overwhelming grief when she should learn his dark fate; of the bitterness of her disappointment, the awkwardness of her po- sition, when she should find herself a stranger in a strange land, away from home and friends, alone, unprotected, exposed to the vicissitudes of war, with the deep mortification of failure to en- counter, the reproach of Union friends, wh o would rejoice at her sorrow and taunt her with her want of success; of the entire helplessness of her Southern friends tq extricate her from the tor- tures of her position ;-all this, like ariving panorama, passed be- fore him to heighten his distress and increase the horrors of his imprisonment. Death, he felt, would be a sweet relief, were it not that the happiness of another was involved in his fate. But in his darkest moments the thought of Evangeline would nerve him, and he resolved that whatever fate awaited him he would live for her sake. Gloating with delight over his successful revenge, feasting with a fiendish joy at the contemplation of the picture of the distress he had wrought, Lasley delighted to recount to his friends in vice and dissipation the achievement of his desires. He 'had van- quished his hated rival, humiliated the 'heart of her wholn lhe had professed to love, foiling all their plans, darkening their every joy Young Roberts, believing it more practicable to join the Con- federate arrmy at Bardstown than at Lexington, had attempted to reach that point. At every stdip he encountered the danger of discovery. His progress was retarded by the movement of the Federal troops, wiho now thronged every road from Louisville that led out in the direction of Bardstown. As he made hs way cautiously from house to house along the route, he heard that General Bragg had left Bardstown, and was falling back upon     366-       RAIDS AND ROMANCE Camp Dick. Robinson. The rumors of his movements were con- flicting and unreliable, and Roberts determined to prosecute his frst intention. Accordingly, he pursued his way to Bardstown. I Reaching that place, he found it in the possession of Federal troops. Being known to no one save young Lasley, of whose im- placable hatred towards him he knew nothing, and being dressed in citizens' clothing, he felt no fear of recognition, and ventured to walk the streets in open day, to see if lie could ascertain the true position of General Bragg, and his safest route totgjoin him. He was walking leisurely along towards the hotel when he met Las- -ley walking between two young men. The two immediately recognized each other. Roberts, smiling, bowed; Lasley bowed coldly. The two passed on. After proceeding a few steps, Harry turned to look after Lasley. He discovered one of the men he had seen with him following on his steps, while Lasley and the other were hastily cryssing the street towards a group of soldiers. Fearing that some evil threatened him, Harry made his way as fast as he could to the hotel. As he entered the door of the bar-room, he observed the individual that had been following him pass by the aoor and cross the street to the right. Harry stood a few minutes as if uncertain how to proceed. Then walk- ing to the door, he looked cautiously out. There was no appear- ance of danger-no blue-coats were to be seen in the street. He breathed more freely. Believing that his fears were wholly un- founded, he returned and quietly seated himself in one corner, where he would be free from  observation. There were three other men in the room besides the bar-keeper, who were all re- joicing together over the certain retreat of the rebels from the State. Harry listened attentively to all they said, endeavoring to gather from their loud and confused statements any information that would serve him in the future. The bar-keeper joined the trio in their tirade of invective against the rebels, and the four were most unsparing in their wild denunciation of every thing Confederate. Harry felt the blood rush to his face, and the words to his lips, but prudence dictated silence, and he choked down his swelling indignation as best he could, and assulmed an air of indif- ference. Looking out of the window into the cross-street, he was not aware of the approaclh of any one, until he heard a heavy foot- fall at the door. He suddenly turned his head in' that direction.' His gaze encountered three Yankee soldiers approaching him. One stepped forward, and laying his hand on his shoulder said, in a harsh tone, " You are my prisoner-follow me!"   i.1            OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         367 "How dare you arrest me!" said Harry, gazing sternly into the face of his captor,- determined to try the force of bravado. It was Ihis only weapon. ' How dare you arrest me, I ask, a peaceable citizen I Show me your authority." The soldier was a man of nerve, and returning Harry's look wilth one equally as firm and unyielding, he very quickly and without the least perturbation responded: " You need /not try to deceive me. You are one of Morgan's men, who has escaped from prison. Come with me-no words, I have no time for discussion." 1Harry saw that he must yield. It was useless to resist. Calmly he arose from his chair and walked out between the soldiers. As he passed along the street that led to the prison, he saw on the opposite side Lasley and his two companions, who were laughing and talking together. He knew that he' was the subject of their remarks, the cause of their merriment, and with the ferocity of a demon he scowled upon them. It was all he could do. He dared notf speak. He knew the heartlessness of his enemies. The prison-door was closed, he was left alone with his thoughts. Silent aind morose he sat, dwelling on the hopelessness of his fate. The hope that had cheered him during his previous imprisonment was now gone. He could see no way of escape. He knew now that he should be watched with the greatest vigilance, from the fact that he had once evaded them. As he sat, sad and despoqd- ing, his head bowed; and his whole attitude expressive of the despair that filled his soul, he heard one of the guard outside say to another: * "We have whipped the rebels all to pieces at Perryville. A man has just reached here, and islays they have been' fighting there since yesterday morning, and are now fighting, and the rebels are being slaughtered like sheep."  Harry started, and applying his ear to the key-hole listened attentively. The two continued their conversation only a few minutes. He gathered from what he heard that the Confederates were sadly whipped. Were this the case, he knew they would have to retreat from the State as best they could. It would be impossible for them to remain, if the first engagement Ishould terminate so disastrously.      . i What will become of Evangeline?" he said to himself, bitterly, as he resumed his seat on the old stool, and buried his face in his hands, while the great drops that he could not force back   368        RAnI ANID OMANCE streamed through his fingers. ' If I knew she was safe, I should ask no more. Oh, God, Itake care of her, and shield her from all danger!" he exclaimed, vehemently, as he sprang from his seat and paced his narrow room. Haunted by his fears for her who n he loved, oppressed under a sense of his utter inability to aid lIer in any way, bereft of all hope in his own case, he was as one bereft of reason. Frenzied, he walked to and fro, until, exhausted from the severe exertion, he sank again-on the hard stool. Could his heartless persecutor have seen him as he sat there, ready to sink under the weight of his fearful doom, surely he would have felt that he was fully avenged. This unfeeling crea- ture was revelling in dissipation and vice, while his victim was writhing in anguish. Why, oh, why is it that the base and grov- elling are often so prosperous, are permitted to sit in high places and grind beneath their crushing injustice the proud and noble soul, who finds no means of defence, no power of redress? When these anomalous aspects of human society present them- selves, we are led to ask, is there a hand of inflexible justice deal- ing out to all, impartially, the reward of their deeds? If so, why do the wicked and debased prosper, and why are the true and ele- vated dashed to the earth beneath their infamous power? Philos- ophy cannot solve the question. Enigmatical it must ever remain to that man who seeks not its solution in the words of heavenly wisdom, which tells us, "When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyedforever. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be." Harry Roberts sat in his dark, noisome prison, filled with the most despondent thoughts, He could see no gleam of light, look which way he might. His future was without promise. He saw nothing before him but captivity, ending in death. He felt that having once escaped, he would hereafter be the object of increased vigilance and of additional insult. And when he looked away to the object of his soul's adoration, the gloom deepened, until all was cheerless niglit. Could he shield her from suffering, chagrin, disappointment, he would not murmur at his own fate. It was for Evangeline far more than himself that he sorrowed. But how unavailing all this grief! He could give her no assistance, no protection. To a proud, self-reliant spirit this sense of utter inability to shield or defend a-loved one is maddening. Robbed   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        369 of the power to exercise the right of protecting the weak and de- pendent, a noble man sinks in his own estimation into nothingness. How many a brave, defiant Southern heart has had to endure this unspeakable humiliation since the war began I While Harry was thus groping his way amid the darkness of the present and future, Evangeline and her friend, Mary, were pursuing their way towards Bardstown. Having obtained a per- mit, they entertained but little apprehension of annoyance or delay from the Federal pi ckets that guarded the road over which they had to pass. They were accompanied by Willie R., the younger brother of Charley, who was to escort them to Bardstown, at which point they were to place themselves under the charge of Mary's cousin, who would give them safe conduct to Lexington, if it were possible to reach that point; if not, they were to be taken rithin Confederate lines, and there remain until Mr. Lawrence, or his son, or young Roberts could be heard fIom. On the two girls travelled, the subjects\of alternate hope and fear. At one moment the prospect before them appeared cheer- 'ing--the plan agreed upon so feasible, success so certain; and then again all was doubt, difficulty, failure. To Evangeline, who was leaving behind her all the friends and associations of her girlhood, bidding them adieu forever, to go forth into a strange land, where there would be but one heart to appreciate her sacri- fices-many to turn with coldness away, some to censure-to her young ardent soul the journey before them was one of the most momentous bearing. Vain were it to attempt a description of her varied and conflicting thoughts and emotions. Sometimes she would weep sadly, as the probabilities of disappointment and con- sequent mortification rose up vividly before her excited imagina- tion; then again she was wild with blissful anticipations at the glad future that opened up before her, when,-all her trials past, she would safely repose on the bosom of him for whom she had yielded up levery promise which had so brightly beanmed over lher pathway-Sbhould listen to his burning words of love-receive the full and tender sympathy of his pure affectionate soul-rest on his strong arm for protection, and claim him her own for life. It was a strange, a novel undertaking for one so young, one reared in the indulgence of every desire, however wild or capricious; but, Evangeline possessed, all unknown to herself and her friends, the1 characteristics of a heroine. Independence of thought and feel- ing, determination to brave difficulties and endure hardships, a commendable freedom firom the tramrnmels of public opinion, will      370        RAIDS AND ROMANCE to accomplish undertakings although fraught with danger-all these were traits of character which a close observer would have 3 marked as possessed by her. And now the incentive of love-of deep, deathless affection for him to whom she had given her heart, called into exercise and prompted to unwonted' energy these-ele- ments of character, which, for want of opportunity to make them- selves manifest, had been hitherto comparatively dormant.    , ,: i Mary shared her young friend's alternate gloom and joy. There  X was even a darker cloud in her horizon, one that overshadowed "the brightness of bler future landscape. It was the uncertain- X ty with regard to Charley's fate, which hourly haunted her     - thoughts.                            . li ' Is he dead?." was the question that constantly recurred to her ruind; and the possibility that this might be so, took away the  X light that would otherwise have gilded the eventful life .she was  now entering upon. That she should meet her father and brother She did not for a moment doubt. She had set out to do this, and .d she calculated upon no failure. She might encounter many diffii.  culties, but it was practical and must be achieved. It was late at night when they reached Bardstown, they having been delayed on the way by the breaking of one of the axletrees  to the-carriage. Most persons had retiredat the hotel at whitch they rested for the night, so that they had no Opportunity of learn- X ing any thing respecting the relative position of the two armies. Weary and worn they sought their room, after having partaken of a cup of tea and sopne cold bread which the landlord had hastily. prepared for them.          1             ! Morning came, and found them sleeping after the fatigue of their journey. The sun was shining fully when Mary awoke. It had     X been their plan to drive out to her aunt's before 'breakfast, that they might proceed several miles on their way during the day. i Awakening Evangeline, the two made a hasty toilet and de- scended to the breakfast-room. They were but just seated at the  table when three young gentlemen entered and placed themselves  a near the foot of the table, on the same side with themselves. Neither of the young girls looked towards them. They were scarcely in their places before a middle-aged man, who was enjoy- ing his coffee and hot roll on the opposite side, called out in rather a loud tone of voice: "What news this morning, Lasley? I hear a courier is in." At the mention of this name Evangeline started, looked sudden- ly around, and turned deadly pale. , The young man who sat next  i   OF MORGAN AND HS aEN.         371 her observed the movement, and fixed his eyes upon her in cu- rious wonder. She was aware of his fixed gaze, and she strove to calm herself. His companions reading his surprise in the ex- pression of his face, followed his example, and directed their look towards the head of the table where the two girls sat. Evange- line was trembling with emotion, vainly endeavoring to preserve an unmoved exterior. Mary saw her agitation, and measurably partook of it, as she realized that the attention of all at table was directed to them. Despite herself, the blood would mount to her face, and her hand perceptibly quivered as she conveyed the cup of coffee to her lips. Across young Lasley's face there shot a look of triumph, and in his eye there gleamed an expression of revengeful satisfaction, as he became assured of the presence of his helpless victim. Elevating his voice above its natural tone, so that his words might reach the ear of Evangeline, he replied to the interrogatory of the gentleman: "The news is most gratifying, indeed. A courier just in from Perryville, brings the reliable intelligence that we whipped the rebels all to pieces on yesterday, and they are now flying, routed and panic-stricken, in the direction, of Lancaster, making their way out of the State as fast as they can. Buell is sure to overtake them before they can reach- Stanford, and the great probability is that the whole army will be captured." "Is it possible!" exclaimed the first speaker. "I fear this is too good to be believed. Is the man to be relied on?" , "Most assuredly. This is the news that is to be sent to Louis- ville. It is official." , "And did we suffer much loss?"1 "Pretty heavy, but by no means sufficient to telay an imme- diate pursuit. General Buell will move on this morning after the scattered and flying troops of Bragg. The Confederate campaign in Kentucky is at an end, sir. The army is literally destroyed, not one in twenty will ever getl back to tell the story of their dis- astrou's defeat."     i Mary and Evangeline sat like statues, pale and immovable. Riveted to their seats by the very hoirorlof the intelligence they \ heard, they felt as if they should faint under its crushing weight. X They looked at each other with an expression of fearful wonder, but neither spoke. They essayed to eat, that their agitation might not be observed. But they could not swallow their food, and trembling, hopeless., helpless, they sat listening to. the conversa-     372        L RAIDS AND ROMANCE tion, every word of which fell like a death setence on their  ears.                    n    -      i "Oh, we will make short work of these invaders of our soil " said Lasley, his very tone speaking the gratification of his heart., "We'll teach them a lesson they will not soon forget. Their au- dacity is unparalleled. Who asked them to come into out' State to A steal, and thieve, and destroy? What right had they to use Union men as they have done, and to possess themselves of our property, :li as they have been constantly doing? By the way, we have got    X one of these patriots, one of Morgan's men, in prison here--a fel-  low that escaped from Louisville on his way to Camp Chase, and who had succeeded in getting this far on his route to the Confed- II erate army."  At this announcement the knife dropped from Evangeline's  I : hand, her heart stood still, all the color forsook her face, her brain reeled, and she felt as if she would fall from her seat.      . : "Yes, I heard something of it when I reached town on yester-  X day.  Who is the young fellow'? and how did it happen he was  : recognized 1?" Evangeline listened with her soul to catch Lasley's answer. "His nLme is Harry Roberts," replied the heartless wretch, X slowly and emphatically. '"He was sauntering along the street  here, in all security, when I recognized him, and knowing that he X was a fugitive froml justice, I had him arrested and placed in con- : finement until he can be sent back to Louisville." Evangeline could hear no more. She arose, left the room, and finding, she knew not how, the chamber where they had slept the night before, she staggered to the bed, on which she threw her- self, and lay rigid, immovable, as one bereft of life. Mary fol-  lowed her quickly.  Finding her in this frightful condition, not-  withstanding her own heart was breaking, she set about restoring her to consciousness. Bathing her face in cold water, apd apply- ing toaher nose a small bottle of sal. volatile which she chanced to i have in her pocket, and chafing her hands and forehead, she suc-  ceeded at last in partially arousing her. The young girl opened her eyes, looked wildly about her, and then, with a shudder, closed them -again and moaned.  Mary was alarmed at her ap- pearance.  Her first impulse was to call for aid, but feeling that their position was one that demanded the greatest caution, she determined to keep the whole matter as secret as possible. Dis- patching William  R. for a servant to bring fresh water, she locked the doo&r, lowered the blinds, and undoing Evangeline's' fJ    OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         373. travelling dress, and removing every thing that might impede circulation, she continued to bathe her temples and rub her hands, at intervals applying the ammonia. After awhile Evangeline opened her eyes a second time, and gazed up imploringly into the face of tler young frien , who was bending over her witl all the ten(derness of a sister.  "He is in prison, Mary," she said, slowly and mournfully. "My life is lost; oh, tlht I could die!" "Do nottalk sce Evangelsine, there is yet hope," replied Mary, feeling that she must maintain all calmnness and courage. "Bet- ter there than dead. We may yet manage to relieve him. Char- ley, you know, has been a prisoner three times. There is hope for Harry, certainly." Evangeline shook her head despairingly. "No, no!" she said, a; she closed her eyes, while the great liquid tears rolled down her / cheeks. "Oh, yes I there is hope, great hope, Evangeline. I will send for Lasley and get himn to interfere. He can be influenced to exert himself in Harry's behalf. Don't give up; it will all be right. These are times when we must not suffer oprselves to be overcome by difficulties, however insuperable they may appear." "But what shamI   do, Mary?" asked Evangeline, aroused by Mary's words and look of calm determination. "Send for Lasley, and appeal to him-surely ne cannot be heartless; lie will interfere for Harry." k "Oh, you do not know Lasley, Mary; he is prompted by no motive but self-interest and gratification. I can appeal to hm-- but oh, it will be so humiliating I yet for Harry's sake I could prostrate myself before him, and plead as a slave to his master; but it will be in vain-he will not hear me--his heart is lard, selfish, brutal." "But, Evangeline, it is the only hope I see for Harlny's release. It may not succeed, but certainly the object is worth the trial; and what is to be done must be done quickly. You heard what he said about the retreat of the Confederates from the State; it may already be too late for us to overtake them." "Send for Lasley, Mary; and yet, how  can I meet him- - how ask a favor at his hands?" she said, a look of disdain overspreading her face; but it is for Harry-for him I will humble myself even to the dust. Were it for myself I would die -,die before I would encounter this heartless, detestable man. Perhaps, Mary, he will not see mee) she said, as she stood before     374        RAIDS AND ROMANCE the mirror, smoothing her dark hair back from her aching fore- head,                      .       r ' You can but try. Willie has gone to ask him to the parlor to meet you there."            . "You must go with me, Mary; I cannot s e him alone." "Yes, Evangie, I will go with you, and gi ve you all the assist- ance I can." In the course of fifteen minutes, which appeared hours to the waiting girls, William R. returned and informed them that Lasley was in the parlor awaiting them.  Nerving herself for the task before her, Evangeline, leaning on  Mary's arm, descended to the parlor and confronted young Las- ley. As she met him, she felt all the spirit of defiance of which her nature was capable swell her bosom. Her face assumed a look of hauteur-her eyes fixed themselves ;esolutely on his- her proud lips compressed, while her nostrils expanded-that unmis- takable evidence of determination and conscious superiority. He received her with the air of one who, aware of his own per- sonal weakness, yet feels strong in the power of circumstances. Mary left them alone, and walked out on the gallery. "I come," she said to him as she seated herself, " to ask you if  it is in your power to have Harry Roberts released from prison." "Indeed!" he responded, with bitter scorn. "Do you come to -me, Miss Lenoir, to ask a favor? to me, whom you have insulted, taunted, derided? I would scarcely think you would ask of me,  whom you have thus treated, to render you assistance-to aid my rival, my foe!" "Harry has never injured you, Edward Lasley. Nor would he ask this at your hands-he would perish first-die in prison a  thousand times rather. It is H come to beseech you for my  sake, for the sake of humanity, of mercy, to act if you have any influence, any power."'  "' When I besought you, Miss Lenoir, to!have compassion on me, to relieve my feelings, did you do it? How did you act when I supplicated? Did I not tell you then we would meet again? and now my words are fulfilled. The scene is cihanged; it is you who now sues. Should I heed your plea? Remember your own scorn, your indifference, your neglect! Though late, revenge has cor e at last; we have met again. You shall never marry Harry Roberts. My words are now made good." t'You knew, Edward Lasley, why I did not marry you. I told you I did not love you, that my heart was another's. Would you   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        375 have wedded me with this fact staring you in the face? Could you have proved so false to yourself, to every pure and noble sen- tirnent, as to wish me to marry you when my affections clung to another?" "But I loved you, Evangeline. You promised to be mine; you broke that vow, and refused to see me." "f I have wronged you, Edward Lasley, I ask your forgiveness. I acted hastily in promising to marry you; I should have con- sidered the subject. Had I done this, I would not have fallen into this fatal error. But was it not best, right, just, when I found that I had acted unwisely-that I did not, could not love you-to tell you so, and thus save us both a life of misery! Surely, Ed- ward Lasley, you cannot upbraid me for this. Why, oh! why do you torture me? Will you endeavor to have Harry released, or shall I plead in vain?" "There is one condition, Evangeline, and only one, on which I will grant your request." "And what is this!" the excited girl exclaimed eagerly. "Say, say! I promise any tiing. Just release Harry, let him once again be free, and you may demand of me whatever you choose. I will e grant any request. Name it, name it!"  "Be careful how you promise," he replied, while his lip curled with irony, "you may have again to repent a rash vow l', "Harry, Harry! if he is free, I ask no more I Any thing, even my life, to save him!" "The condition is"-and the young man fixed his eye intently on the girl before him as he slowly uttered his horrid stipulation. She trembled under his look and the ominous tone of his voice. i'"The condition is-and it is the only one-that you will marry me at the time mentioned in your last note." Oh! heaven pity me!" ejaculated Evangeline, starting frantic- ally from her seat. "Marry you, Edwitrd Lasley? marry you? oh, how can you ask of me to do this? Any thing, any thing but tlis. This is not the only condition; it cannot be-you would not be so cruel-you could not make yourself unhappy for life-curse your- self and me. Oh, no! you do not mean this; you are jesting, sporting with my feelings. I beseech you , spare me;oh, spare me!" Her manner was wildly excited, her face livid and rigid, her lip quivered, her voice was harsh and broken, she trembled in every nerve as the gazed upon him. He met her look coldly, calmly, unfeelingly. Around his mouth there lurked a smile of fiendish enjoyment-in his eye there rested a look of dogged determina-     376'       RAIDS AND ROMANCE     E tion. He spoke not; but sat, his eyes riveted on the suffering girl, as if gloating over her anguish. Evangeline read his thoughts, and her heart beat wildly.                     "You do not ask me to marry you, Edward Lasley i" she re- sumed, after some moments' pause, during. which he did not remove his steadfast gaze. "Oh! you do not require this of mle as the  return for releasing Harry from prisonl No, no I you will not be -  so cruel!"                           X "Nothing more I ask-nothing less will satisfy my demand. I love you, Evangeline, and have determined to make you my wife.  Say you will marry me, and Harry Roberts shall be free in an hour ;-refuse, and the setting sun shall find him in Louisville, on his way to a Northern prison-and I suppose to death."      X "I do not love you-I tell you once again, I cannot love you,  i X Edward Lasley. How then could I ever consent to be your wife?"  ' Marry me, and you will afterwards learn to love me. Marry me, I ask no more. I will risk all the consequences."  She bowed her head, as if in deep thought. But how could her  poor distracted brain think-reeling as it was with the horrors of the destiny that awaited her--let her choose as she might. Silent and bewildered she sat there, stupefied with grief.       . "You must answer me now, Evangeline. There is no time to lose. In half an hour the stage will leave for Louisville, and un- less you consent to my proposal, Roberts shall be sent down." 1 Oh! wait-wait-let me have time to think. I cannot decide -the question is too momentous." "tNo time for wasting; you must conclude speedily. A few minutes must decide the question forever. It rests with you." "'Oh! Harry, Harry!" exclaimed Evangeline, as she buried her face in her hands. "Must I make this great sacrifice?-must I marry him, and leave you forever? Oh I how can I do this! knd yet, if I refuse, your life will pay the forfeit. We shall never meet again! Yes, yes," she said to herself, "if he can but be fiee, I am happy. To spare him, I will die; yes, die. I will give I1 myself for him."                        , "Do I understand that you consent to be my wife, Evangeline?" i said Lasley, as these low-spoken words fell on his ear. She looked suddenly up at him.      ,- "You will have Harry released if I promise you this; you will not deceive me?"  -  "I will not deceive you, Evangeline. I Roberts shall be a free   J OF fORG-AN AND HS MEN.       3" man and placed in a position of safety befor'e the sun goes down."                 i "Then I consent," she said, slowly, in a low, husky voice, as if her soul spoke out its eternal doom in these few words. "And will marry me at the- appointed time?" She bowed assent. "Remember, Evangeline, what you promise. Do not deceive yourself-think not to deceive me."         ' She gazed at him, but replied not. "And when shall Harry ibe free?" she asked, as if she had naught else on earth to desire but his release and safety. "Very soon. I will go now and make the arrangements." "And may I not see him once-just once-to bid him farewell; to tell him all. Oh! deny me not this request. It is but a poor one-the last one." "Yes; you may go with me to the prison, Evangeline, but you must remain here until I can see about it. I will call in a few minutes and let you know." "And do you mean, Evangeline, to marry him?" a*fked her friend, who entered the room as Lasley left, and heard from the lips of the desponding girl the story of her fearful promise. "Oh, ask me not, Mary. I am wild, wild!" and Evangeline clasped her friend in the agony of despair. "Great God!" she exclaimed, "what have 1 done-what shall I do! Oh, Harry, Harry! must I be torn from you forever!" Young Lasley returned to announce that he was ready to go to the prison to see about the release of Harry. "Oh, go with me, Mary," besought Evangeline, as they ascend- ed the stairway to their room. "Go with me, Mary-; it may be the last favor I shall ever ask -of you. Will you go through the lines, Mary? Will you risk yourself in the present wild and con- fused state of things? 'Oh, do not leave: me! Stay, stay, there may yet come relief."         : u"I must go, Evangelin. You krinow all J hold most dear on earth is there. My father, my brother, and-Charley-if he still lives. I grieve to leave you, Evangeline, but you'know my heart is with the South. I could no longer life amid the scenes of my once happy, but now desolate home. What awaits me in my at- tempt to get out, or what is before me in the future, I know not. It is all darkly wild, fearfully strange; but I will brave it all, be- lieving it to be right."    ! n Mary threw ODn her hat and tied it, and was in the act of put-     378        RAIDS AND ROMANCE ting on her gloves to join Evangeline, who stood awaiting her, when Willie R. rushed up the steps and into theroom, exclaiming in broken accents: "Morgan!-Morgan!-Morgan is coming, Miss Mary! Will be in this town directly with his men!" ,  The two girls looked at the agitated boy in silent astonishment. Had he lost his senses  "It's true! it's true, Miss Mary! I heard a man say so, who just now dashed into the town-says he saw them all."  "He is deceiving you, Willie," saidi Evangeline. "Somebody wants to create an excitement."  Just then a rush was heard below-stairs. The two girls ranl down to the parlor to ascertain its cause. They there encounter-  ed some ladies and several gentlemen, all in the greatest pertur- bation."  "Morgan! Morgan!" was on every lip. "Is Colonel Morgan coming here?" asked Mary, bf the gentle- man next her.  "Yes, miss; is within a few miles of the place. Will be here directly."  "May there not be some mistake about it?" "None in the world-it is so. I have seen two men whom I know to be truthful. They saw Morgan at the head of his forces I but a few minutes ago, coming right in the direction of the town. The whole place is in confusion. Men arpe running to and fro, and the soldiers are scared to death."  "Will they offer any resistance, sir?" "Oh, I suppose not. It would be useless to do so. There is comparatively but a small force here, and tley have had so little  warning, that they could not prepare to fight. Oh, no, they will all be made prisoners." Evangeline looked around. Lasley was gone. Her heart throb- bed violently as she thought that perhaps he had gone to see that  Roberts was conveyed to some point beyond the reach of Morgan.  By this time the hitherto quiet streets of the little town were filled  with frantic people hurrying to and fro. "Morgan! Morgan "  X was on every tongue. Many were the bright faces in these busy throngs, as it became certain that the rumor was true. There were many friends to the Southern cause in Bardstown, ever ready to greet the champions of liberty and right. A felw minutes more of suspense and wild conjecture, and the Confederates, headed by their gallant leader, dashed into the town I                , I   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        379 amid the cheers, and shouts, and loud huzzas of the expectant crowd.  As the deafening acclaim rang out on the air, Mary and Evan- geline rushed with others to the gallery of the hotel. What a mo- ment of rapture to these two anxious hearts! "Free! free! Harry will now be free!" shouted Evangeline, forgetful of the presence of those around her. "Free! free! and I released from that fearful engagement! Oh; God! I thank thee!" and she clapped her hands in the delirium of joy. "Be still, Evangie. Watch and see if you can find John, my brother. Oh, if he is only with them!" She had but just finished the words, when her brother came prancitg by. He chanced to be looking in the direction of the hotel. As Mary caught a glimpse of his form, she shouted: "John, John! my brother, my brother!" The soldier recognized his sister. A moment more, and she was clasped in his arms. In a few words Mary made known to him the sto; of. Harry Roberts's imprisonment. Without delay he hastened to inform Colonel Morgan, who immediately sent a squad of men to open the prison dodrs, and set the prisoner free. "My God, Lawrence! is this you?" exclaimed Harry, as, open- ing the door of his narrow room, he met, face to face, the friend of his childhood, his deliverer. How came you here? and how did you know I was in this wretched place?" While he spoke, he continued to shake the hand of his friend warmly, his face speaking out the full gratitude of his soul. "We came to deliver youi from the clutches of the Yanks, and we have accomplished our purpose, you see," answered Law- rence. "Thanks, thanks, a thousand thanks for your opportune pres- ence. I was daily looking to be sent to Camp Chase or the gal- lows. You know this is my second arrest, and I wasn't sure they wouldn't hang me. But, tell me, are all the boys here?' "Come out and see. Are you so attached to your headquar- ters as to be unwilling to leave them? Really it looks like it. You are a free man. Come, enjoy your liberty." Just outside the door stood Brent, Irving, Curd, and other of Harry's friends, awaiting his appearance. When they saw him they made the air ring with their shouts of congratul tion. Each in turn grasped his hand, and shook it warmly, as the welcomed him back to the privileges of a freeman and a soldier. It was a     380        RAIDS AND ROMANCE         happy moment for Harry, one he fiad never expected to realize. H There was but one apprehension to mar his joy, that was fear for i Evangeline. He longed to ask if any thing had been heard from her, but he deemed it so impossible that he dared not venture the question.            i  The boys conducted him to the hotel. Following Lawrence, he X entered the parlor.     ,  CH HARRY!"Evangeline could say no more, as she sprang from her seat towards him.                     " He clasped her in his arms. Not a word escaped his lips. The tears rushed to his eyes, and fell from his manly cheeks. :I "Evangeline! Evangeline! i Oh, God! and you are here safe!" i he said, as soon as be could find utterance. "How came you g : here, Evangeline? Do tell me! As soon would I have expected to have met an angel visitant from heaven as you. Did you know I was here? No, no, you could not. I thought you were at    i Lexington, or perhhps had not yet left Louisville." The young girl related to her lover the outline of her adven tures. When -she mentioned Lasley's name, Harry sprang to his feet, and asked where he could be found. She dared not tell him  of the insult-the infamous promise extracted from her. She   ; knew that Lasley's life would be the propitiation for his deep, damning wrong. "4 OLh, do not trouble yourself about him;" interposed Lawrence.  "Wickliffe will attend to his case. I expect he is now occupying your room at your late headquarters."         . '( There he goes now, I suppose," said Brent, looking down froni the window. ' Wickliffe has some young, black-haired upstart in charge."'                           X There was a general rush to the balcony. Lasley looked up at S the suddeo movement. His eye rested on Evangeline beside Har-  ry Roberts.: The vanquisher was vanquished. His eyes fell to the ground, and he marched on powerless as a child, chagrined, disappointed. A short walk brought himr to the jail. Conduct- ing him in, the boys left him alone to hig own reflections. Mary immediately informed John of her intention to accompany him through to -Ten/nessee.  "' How can thig be done, Mary? , It is impossible." i t"Not :im ossible, John. You and Harry must get a carriage, and send us under special escort. - You- tell me ladies have gone out from Lexington. There is Mrs. John C. Breckinridge and iothers now under the protection of General Bragg's army finding ',-,',.,               S:   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.         381 their way South. , You know father expected me through. How dreadful he must have felt when he found I did not come! He thinks I am in Louisville, of course, separated from him--perhaps forever. Oh, I must go through, let it cost what it may. I can take no denial." A plan was soon devised that promised entire safety. A vehi- cle was procured, and all arrangements made for the party to set dut after dinner. John Lawrence was transformed into a plain, peaceable citizen, by donning the civilian's suit of blapk cloth that Evangeline had purchased to insure tarry's safety, and which she had taken the precaution to place in her carpet-sack while Harry readily metamorphosed himself into a soldier, by enrobing in John's military garb, land .taking possession of his horse and all accoutrements. It was decided that they should travel as rapidly as possible, keeping under the protection of the cavalry force until beyond danger from the few Federals that were scattered around in the country intervening between Bardstown and Elizabethtown. Never did a happier party set out on a perilous journey. Ap- prehension had given place to a feeling of security, agitation had changed to tranquillity, sorrow! to joy. On they travelled as rapidly as it was practicable, meeting with no danger, encountering no cause of alarm-a merry, cheery com- pany, where past trials were all forgotten in the bliss of the pres- ent, and the promise of the future; When between New Haven and Elizabethtown, the CQonfeder- ates encountered a wagon-train of supplies, guarded by a small Federal force. After a slight resistance on the part of the Yan- kees, the wholei was captured and destroyed. This was the first acquaintance with' the a art of war" that Evangeline and Mary had had, and brave as they were, their hearts quailed as they heard the rapid clash, the quickl, successive firing of the musketry. After this encounter, Colonel Morgan swept over the country be- tween Elizabethtown and Mumfordsville towards the Ohio river, and formed a junction with Colonel Johnson in the neighborhood of Henderson.  His object was to secure recruits, and give oppor- tunity to the guerillas of these counties to get through into Ten- nessee, and in this he succeeded finely, accomplishing his purpose, besides' destroying Federal stores at many points, and interrupting, communication with Nashville. l      382        RAIDS-AND ROMANCE CHAPTER LVI. THE CONSUMMATION. THE two girls under the care of young Lawrence pursued their journey into Tennessee by the way of Glasgow and Hartsville, and on the evening of the sixth day arrived at Mr. Jamison's, in the vicinity of McMinnville. Through the kind assistance and direction of friends, they had avoided every semblance of danger. The trip had been one of fatigue and anxiety, but all this was for- gotten by the happy party, as they sat around the cheerful fire of the hospitable farmer and recounted their adventures. Mr. Jamison informed them that Charley had recovered, and had passed through his neighborhood a few days before, taking dinner with him. He was on his way into Kentucky to join his command.  Mary's eager heart heard the intelligence of-his recovery With a thankful joy which no words could portray, but when she was informed of his mission into Kentucky, fear and despondency seized her soul. She felt that fate was against her. She had risked all to come to Charley, and now he was gone, perhaps to become a prisoner in the hands of the enemy. Evangeline endeavored to console her, by telling her that Charley would very soon obtain information of the Confederate retreat from Kentucky, and return to McMinnville. But her fears were aroused. She could see nothing but disappointment hover- ing over her future pathway. Imagine then her joy when, on the day following, Charley rode up to Mr. Jamison's. As Evangeline had said, he had learned that Colonel Morgan was coming out of the State, and knowing that he would likely establish his headquarters at McMinnville, he had returned to Mr. Jamison's to await him. The meeting was as unexpected to Charley as Mary, and their mutual joy at thus again beholding each other, after all the trials, suspense, and anxiety that had tortured their hearts during their separation, was akin to the bliss of Eden,-was as the light from   OF MORGAN AND HS MEN.        383 the celestial spheres shining into their souls, chasing therefrom every vestige of darkness and sadness. Two days more, and Colonel Morgan, with his force now large- ly increased from different parts of Kentucky, arrived in the vi- cinity of McMinnville, and encamped in the neighborhood of Mr. Jamison. Harry Roberts was safe, and never were there happier hearts than the four that, on the evening of the arrival of Colonel Morgan's forces, assembled around the cheerful board of the kind host, Mr. Jamison. The evening passed in recitals of adventures and escapes. Each had a thrilling story to relate-a history in itself worthy of record. The rapture of the present was heightened by the remembrance of thl trials of the past. Tlere are times in the life of every individual when the bliss of years concentres in a few fleeting moments. No words can pic- ture the joy of such seasons. They are brief, but in their rapid flight they write remembrances on the soul as with the point of the diamond-relaembrances which all the vexation, all the grief of after-life canndt wipe out from the tablet whereon they are en- graved. There they remain, unmarred, ineffaceable-a well-spring of rapture to the heart as long as it continues to throb. And in  old age we look back from the gathering shades of years upon these green and sunny memories, and linger around their blissful haunts' until the heart is young again, and our youth is renewed more potently than if we had drank of the famed Elixir of Life of the Oriental magician. Such a moment was the present one to the bounding hearts of the lovers. How quickly and effectually, as if under the magic wand of some kind genii, did all past sorrows, all apprehensions, fade out in the sunlight which was now flooding their enraptured bosoms! We need not dwell in detail on the incidents of the few succeed- ing days, nor give our readers all the suggestions of the various parties as to the proper course to be pursued by the lovers. Suf- fice it to say, that after much debate, innumerable propositions and devising, a plan was finally adopted, and all necessary arrange- ments made for its speedy consummation. A week passed. Within the respectable home of Mr. Jamison, Colonel Morgan and staff, together with all the particular friends of Charley and Harry, and a few of the jespecial acquaintances of the family, were assembled to witness the marriage of Mary Law- rence and Evangeline Lenoir to the two gallant soldiers, Charley R. and Harry Roberts.     384        RAIDS AND ROMANCE It was a cool evening in October. That month of mingled sad- ness and-beauty was bidding a last, an ethrnal farewell to earth. The hand of autumn had dyed, with richest hues, the foliage of the forest, and spread, with lavish beauty, over all nature a gar- ment of gilded splendor. But as the eye rested on this gorgeous vesture, the heart read beneath it all lessons of decay and tl. The trappings of the tomb were visible through all the ,y para- phernalia, and amid the sweet symphonies could be heard the low wail of the dirge which earth chanted for her bright and beautiful children, so soon to sleep forever in the deep, dark grave which had relentlessly swallowed up, age after age, the offspring of her care and nourishment. , The wind sighed, mournfully, the requiem of the dead.. Tlrough the boughs of the tall old trees it crept, waking them to notes of saddest music. In striking, genial contrast to the darkness and gloom without, was the happy, cheerful' scene within. There glad faces beamed brightly, and heart went out to heart in kindly sympathy. The bright wood-fire which tlazed so determinedly on the hearth, as if resolved to add its quota to the general enjoy- ment, threw a cheery aspect over the scene; and the glad faces of Mr. and Mrs. Jamison plainly spoke the pleasure it g ve them to be active participants on an occasion so happy. It was a unique affair-so every one felt. But around it clustered so much of novelty, that the strangely peculiar features of the occasion were lost beneath the interest tiAt this very novelty excited. I Dressed in deepest mourning, her face flusihed into the most transcendent beauty, Mary Lawrence entered the room, leaning on the arm of Charley. He bore himself proudly erect, conscious of the responsibility of his position, and the consequences involved in the sacred relation he was about to assume. Immediately following them were Evangeline and Harry. In consonance with the circumstances, she wore a silk of dark olive, finished at the neck and wrists by a handsome collar and cuffs of Valenciennes lace. Her rich dark hair was combed back from the full round brow, and rolled into a heavy bandeau behind her ears, covering the back of the well-formed head. Some simple rose- buds were her only ornament. In making her bridal toilet she recalled the conversation that had occurred on; the occasion of her friend Lu's marriage, and the handsome breastpin and bracelet were left in the case, and the place of the former supplanted by some fresh rose-buds. It was a strikingly impressive scene. There stood two mianly   OF MOR-GAN AND ms MEN.{      S  385 forms, animated by as brave and daring hearts as ever throbbed in human bosom-exiles from their homes, defenders of the high and holy cause of liberty and right--the representatives of manv a fiercely contested and successful battle-field-the escaped ,vic- tims of fiendish hate and cruelty; while beside them, leaning con- fidingly on themn for protection and support, stood two beautiful females, who, raised in indulgence and luxury, accustomed to all that can make life pleasant, and throw around it the charms of elegance and refinement, had forsaken all these comforts and joys, had encountered hardship and danger, that they might solace in i exile, relieve in distress, and comfort in affliction these brave men, to whom they had given the true, undying affection of their Young and trusting hearts. Beautiful picture! Life does not often present its counterpart. The minister approached and stood before them. Alluding in brief, chaste words to the peculiar position of those who were about to take upon themselves the sacred vow, he proceeded sol- emnly, yet beautifully, to unite them in the holy ties of marriage. And thus, after trials and sorrows, difficulties and disappoint- ments, that butI few so young are called on to., endure and over- come, these foul tried but heroic hearts found at last the full con- summation of their hopes, the fruition of earthly joy. i And here, amid their happiness, we leave them; bid them fare- well, while gladness beams around their pathway, and fills their young and bounding hearts with bright visions of that future which beckons tlhem  on to fresh delights, and ever-awakening joys. We will not now anticipate and portray the cares, the anxieties, the fearful looking for of news from the Tread battle. field-,the sickening, racking jdisappointment at tidinligs delayed- the nights of watching, the dfays of waiting, when the girl-wife, in the bitterness of separation from the young husband-gone forth to fresh deeds of valor and blood-shall wait, and watch, and pray, yea, faint, beneath the weight of disappointed hope and torturing suspense.  Ah, no! Let us not lift the veil that would reveal this painful panorama. The contrast would be too striking, too sad. Victories must yet be won; many an ensanguineed plain must yet attest the heroic and successful struggles of Morgan and his men, before a nation can shout, in loud and grateful strains, "Victory I victory!! independence! independence! I!" That day approaches. The clouds begin to lift themselves from the horizon of our national future. Already the faint glimmerings 17     386      ,RAIDS AD  ROMANCE, ETC. of the day-dawn of peace are beginning to throw their glowing light through the- dark shades that have so long enveloped us. Let us hope for this glorious realization of-our desires, pray for it, and, above all, let/ us put forth every energy, strain every nerve, avail ourselves of1 every resource, endure every hardship, sur- mount every obstacle, vanquish every difficulty, until this blessed era shall burst upon us, and we, a free and independent people, shall unite as with one voice in pleans of triumph and thanlsgiv- ing.  Already, since the happy scene we have just described, have Hartsville, Elizabethtown, Muldrough's Hill, and other points borne witness to the indomitable spirit of Morgan and of Duke- of Hanson and of Hunt-of Harper and Gano--of Charley, Harry,* Burt, Curd, Irving, Castleman, Wickliffe, Hawkins, young Mor-. gan, and nunbers of unknown heroes, whose endurances anid achievements, full of chivalry and romance, will yet be added to the page of history, as deeds worthy the emulation and. praise of their grateful anc admiring countrymen and whose names, co?- ered with glory, shall become household words with a free and prosperous posterity.  I APPENDIX.       APPENDIX.          389 APPENDIX.  GENERAL JOHN H. MORGAN Is one, and the oldest, of six brothers, all of whom, save one, have been active and useful in the present struggle of our young Corfederacy, devoting their all to the great cause. Calvin O. Morgan has acted as an agent at home in Kentucky for the com- 1 mand of his brother, and has undoubtedly done as much good in that capacity as he would have done had he been in the field. His third brother, Colonel Richard Morgan, is the adjutant-general of the junior Hill, and has been with that gallant officer through his whole campaign. The fourth brother, Major Charlton H. Morgan, is at present in his brother's command, having been recently trans- ferred from the army of the Potomac. When the present war broke out, Charlton Morgan represented the United States govern- ment abroad. He immediately resigned his position and came home to take his part in the struggle, and was the first member of his family to come into the Confederate States. The fifth brother, Lieutenant Thomas Morgan, at present a prisoner at '"Camp Chase," Ohio, was one of the first youths of Lexington to shoulder his musket and march to the defence of Kentucky. The sixth brother is yet too young to bear arms. General Morgan, as were all of his brothers, was born and edu- cated near the city of Lexington, in Kentucky, and is a lineal de- scendant of Morgan of Revolutionary fame. In 1846, during the Mexican war, when the call came for " more volunteers," John H. Morgan, then scarcely of age, raised a com- pany, and was just upon the point of starting when the news  reached the States that a treaty of Peace had been concluded. Well do the survivors of that company remember the conduct of their captain upon the disbanding of his company. Every man of the company (which lwas principally composed of young men dependent upon their labor for support) was indemnified for the h0ss of his time during the period of recruiting. 'Twas at this     390          APPENDIX. time that Morgan gained the title of captain. The Kentuckians of his command still refuse to recognize or apply any other title to him than that of "THE CAPTAIN." General Morgan is not a "West Pointer," but one of the few men who was born to command, as he has incontestably proven. He believes that it is his destiny to fight against a race of men whose every principle is so utterly repulsive to his own noble nature. His contempt for the Yankee character is great and natural, and his daring deeds in this war show how thoroughly he understands it. Some time after the Mexican war, he purchased an establishment and engaged in the manufacture of jeans, linseys, and bagging for the Southern market. About the same time he married the ac- complished Miss Rebecca Bruce (whose traitor brothers are all against us in this war). After years of suffering from sickness, she died about the commencement of the present troubles. After performing the last sad rites to his departed wife, he immediately and secretly collected a little band of followers, not over twenty- five in number, and left the country, making his way to Green river, where he reported himself to the Confederate officer in command " ready for duty." His band was rapidly increased by the arrival of exiles from Kentucky, who knew well the worth and valor of the man as a leader.  His command, upon reporting, were placed, with some other cavalry, upon picket duty on the Green river, where he began a series of bold and daring exploits, which are unequalled for their boldness and the manner of their execution. It was his determination when he left his home in Kentucky, should his command ever become numerous enough, to return and drive out the crop-eared Puritans, who, through Kentucky's gen- erosity, had quite ruined his native State, by overrunning it and driving her sons to the States of the Southwest. A little incident, showing the strategic powers of Morgan, is here worthy of mention: An order was issued by the authorities of Kentucky, from headquarters at Frankfort, that all the arms in the State should be forthwith forwarded to the State armory, there to be inspected and repaired for the use of the "State Guard," who were to maintain what the Union shriekers termed Kentucky's "ARMED NEUTRALITY." General Morgan, then cap- tain of the "Lexington Rifles," was suspected of having evil in- tentions against the peace and quiet of "Uncle Sam," or rather that "old Hoosier," King Abraham. It was, however, known to   APPENDIX.          391 all loyal Kentuckians that he was " a good man and true;" in other words, that he was for his State first, last. and all the time. Hence the Lincolnites kept a sharp eye on the guns held by Morgan's company. Morgan knew that they had determined to get the arms out of his hands, and issued the order mainly for that pur- pose. And he, in turn, had determined that they should not have them; so, in the dead of night, Ithey were removed some dis- tance from the city, and the boxes, in which they were to have been placed, neatly filled with bricks instead, and marked "Guns from Captain Morgan, State Armory, Frankfort.' Good care was taken that the boxes should reach the depot at Lexington just too late, and there they lay exposed to public view. The Lincoln- ites received the boxes with unspeakable delight, winking and blink- ing at one another, supposing that they had fixed Morgan and his Secesh company, and flattering themselves that they had for once in their lives defeated a man who had always been as a thorn in their sides. That night Captain Morgan, in command of his brave band, passed through Lawrenceburg, Ky., a distance of twenty- five miles from Lexington, having in their possession eighty fine rifles belonging to the Yankee government. At the commencement of the present struggle, General Morgan was possessed of great wealth, all of which he left in the hands of the enemy when he came South. He has ever been a public spirited gentleman, and dispensed his means with a liberal hand for the public good. There are many who can testify to his quiet manner of doing good. There is no man living who can say of John H. Morgan, that he went to him " tired and hungry, and he fed him not; he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not." General Morgan is now about thirty-six years of age, and in the full vigor of manhood. He is about six feet in his stockings, as straight as an Indian, and magnificently proportioned; light curly hair, small gray eyes, and fair complexion. His general appear- ance is that of a gentleman of leisure-his carriage exceedingly graceful and manly, with rather an. inclination to be fastidious in his dress.- His modest, unassuming style of speech, when ad- dressed, at once assures you that you are in the presence of an unpretending, thorough-bred Kentucky gentleman. Unlike many other of the great men of war, though a man who entertains great respect for religion, he is not a member of the church. His deeds have been heralded throughout the broad limits of the universe, and his name will be cherished wherever the "Stars and Bars" of his beloved Confederacy wave.      392          APPENDIX. MORGAN'S OPERATIONS IN INDIANA AND OHO. RICHMOND, VA., Friday, July 31, 1863. MESSRS. EDITORS :-As much interest has been manifested in reference to the recent raid of General Morgan, I have thought it but right to add my "mite" to assist in appeasing the appetite of the public, who are eagerly devouring every morsel or crumb of news coming from General Morgan's command. Sincerely sorry that the Federal gunboats cut off the finishing of the account, I shall at once commence. The command of General J. H. Morgan, consisting of detach- ments from two brigades, numbering 2,028 effective men, with. four pieces. of artillery-two Parrots, and two howitzers-left Sparta, Tennessee, on the 27th of June, crossed the Cumberland, near Barkesville, on the 2d of July, finished crossing at daylight on the 3d. Means of transportation-canoes and dug-outs, im- provised for the occasion. Were met by Colonel Hobson's cav- alry, estimated at 6,000, drove them back to Jamestown, Ky., and our column marched on through Columbia, at which point found the advance of Woolford's celebrated Kentucky Cavalry, numbering 250 men, dispersed it, killing seven and wounding fif- teen men. Our loss, two killed and two wounded. Marched on to Stockade, at Green river, on the 4th. Colonel Johnson, commanding the second brigade, attacking stockade, rifle-pits, and abattis of timber. After heavy slaughter on both sides, our forces withdrew: loss about 60 killed aid wounded on each side. Of Morgan's command, the gallant Colonel Chenault fell, pierced through the head with a Minnie ball, as he led his men in a charge upon the rifle-pits. The lion-hearted Major Brent also poured out his life-blood upon the field. Indeed, this was the darkest day that ever shone upon our command-" commissioned officers were killed and nine wounded. Moving on to Lebanon on the 5th, we attackid the town (fortiiied), and after five hours' hard fighting, captured the place, with 4 vast amount of stores, 483 prisoners, one 24-pounder, and many finet horses. The commandant of the post was Colonel Charles Hanson, brother to the lamented Brigadier-general Roger Hanson, who fell at Murfreesboro. His command, raised in the heart of the Blue-    APPENDIX. I         393 grass region, contained brothers and other near relatives to our brave boys; notwithstanding which, when the gallant patriot young Lieutenant Tom Morgan, a brother to our general, and idol of the command, fell, loud and deep were the maledictions that ascended against the cowardly cravens for seeking shelter in dwelling-houses, and the question was raised as to their right to receive quarter. The enemy lost nine killed and 15 wounded;. our loss, three killed and six wounded. Rapid marches brought us to Brandenthurg on the 7th, where Captain Sam Taylor, of the old Rough and Ready family, had succeeded in capturing two fine steamers. From eight i M. on the 8th until seven A. M. on the 9th, was consumed in fighting back the Federal gunboats, whipping out 300 Home Guards, with artil-  lery, on the Indiana shore, and crossing the command. The first was accomplished by Captain Byrne, with his battery-two Par- rots and two 12-pound howitzers; the second, by an advance regiment, capturing the guards, and securing a splendid Parrot gun, elegantly rigged. 9th.-Marched on to Corydon, fighting near there 4,500 State militia, and capturing 3,400 of them, and dispersing the remainder; then moving without a halt through Salisbury and Palmyra to Salen, at which point, telegraphing with our operator, we first learned the station and numbers of the enemy aroused for the hunt; discovered that Indianapolis was running over with them; that New Albany contained 10,000; that 3,000 had just arrived at Mitchell; and, in fact, 25,000 mpn were armed and ready to meet the "bloody invader." Remaining at Salem only long enough to destroy the railroad bridge and trac ,we sent a scout to the Ohio and Mississippi road, near Seyinour, to burn two bridges, a depot, and destroy the track for two miles, which was effected in an incredibly-short time. Then taking the road to Lexington, after riding all night, reached that point at daylight, capturing a number of supplies, and destroying, during the night, the depot and track at Vienna, on the Jeffersonville and Indianapolis railroad. Leaving Lexing- ton, passed on north to the Ohio and Mississippi railroad, near Vernon, where, finding'General Manson, with a heavy force of in- fantry, we skirmished with him two hours as a feint, while the main command moved round the town to Dupont, where squads were sent out to cut the roads between Verno annd Seymour on the west, and Madison on the south, a0d Vernon and Columbus on the north. Not much brighter were the bonfires and illumin- 17*     394          APPENDIX. ations in the celebration of the Vicksburg victory by the Yankees, than our counter-illuminations around Vernon. Many old ladies were aroused from their slumbers to rejoice over the brilliant vic- tories recently achieved. Surmises we e various and many. One old lady knew that the city of Richmond was on fire; another that Jeff. Davis had been killed; a third that the army of Vir- ginia was used up. Not one knew that General John H, Morgan was within two hundred miles of them. -Daylight brought the news, and then, for miles, houses were found vacant. Loaves of bread and buckets of pure fresh water, with an occasional sprinkle of wines, liquors, and sweetmeats, were thrust upon us. Terror was depicted on every countenance, until a brief conversation assured them that we were not warring upon women and children. Then their natural effrontery would return, and their vials of uncorked wrath would pour upon us streams, as muddy as if emanating from old Abe's brain. From Vernon we proceeded to Versailles, capturing 500 militia there, and gathering on the road. Near this point, Captain P., a Presbyterian chaplain and former line-officer in one of our regi- ments, actuated by a laudable desire to change steeds, moved ahead, flanking the advance, and running upon a full company of State militia. Imitating his commander's demeanor, he boldly rode up to the company and inquired for the captain. Being in- formed that there was a dispute as to who should lead them, he volunteered his services, expatiating largely upon the part he had played as an Indiana captain at Shiloh, and was soon elected to lead the valiant Hoosiers against the "invading rebs." Twenty minutes spent in drilling inspired complete confidence; and when  the advance guard of Morgan's band had passed without Captain P. permitting the Hoosiers to fire, he ordered them into the road and surrendered them to our command.  Crestfallen, indeed, were the Yanks; but General Morgan treated them kindly, re- turning to them their guns, advised them to go home and not corre hunting such game 4gain, as they had every thing to lose and nothing to gain by it. From Versailles we moved without interruption arross to Har- rison, Ohio, destroying the track and burning small bl idges on the Lawrenceburg and Indianapolis railroad. At Harrison we burned a fine bridge. Leaving Harrison at dusk, with noiseless tread we moved around Cincinnati, passing between that city and Hamil- ton, destroying the railroad; and a scout running the Federal pickets into the city, the whole command marched within seven   APPENDIX!          395 miles of it. Daylight of the 14th found us eighteen miles east of Cincinnati; sunset had leftus twenty-two miles west, but the cir- cuitous route we travelled was not less than one hundred miles. During this night's march many of our men, from excessive fa- tigue, were riding along fast asleep. Indeed, hundreds would have been left asleep on the road had it not been for the untiring vigilance of our gallant general. Up and down the line he rode, laughing with this one, joking with that, assuming a fierce de- meanor with another, and so on. None were left, and when we reached the railroad near Camp Dennison, few persons would have guessed the fatigue the men had undergone from their fresh and rosy appearance. A fight was imminent. Madam Rumor had been whispering that old Granny Burnside would pay us a visit that morning, but instead of arriving, he sent us a train of cars with several of his officers, who were kindly received, and in honor of their arrival a grand fire was made of the cars, &c. Nothing of special importance occurred after passing Dennison, except at Camp Shady the destruction of seventy-five army wagons and a vast amount of forage: until the morning of the 19th our command had heavy marches over bad roads, making detours, threatening both Ohillicothe and Hillsboro on the north, and Gallipolis on the South. Daily were we delayed by the annoying cry of L"Axes to the front," a cry that warned us of buskwhackers, ambuscades, and blockaded roads. From the 14th to the 19th every hillside contained an enemy, and every ravine a blockade. Dispirited and worn down, we reached the river at three A. M., on the 19th, at a ford above. Pomeroy, I think, called Portland. At four, two companies were thrown across the river, and were in- stantly opened upon by the enemy; a scout of three hundred men were sent down the river half a mile, who reported back that they had found a small force behind rffle-pit3a and asked permis- sion of General Morgan to charge. He assented, and by five he was notified that Colonel Smith had successfully charged the pits, capturing 150 prisoners. Another courier arriving about the same time, reported that a gunboat had approached near our bat- tery, and,nQu being fired upon, had retired precipitately. General Morgan finding both of these reports correct, and be- lieving that he had sufficient time to cross the command, was us- ing every exertion to accomplish the task, when simVaneously could be heard the discharge of artillery from down the river, a heavy drumming sound of small-arms in the rear and right; from the banks of the river came up three black columns of infantry,     396          APPENDIX. firing upon our men, who were in' close column, preparing to cross. Seeing that the enemy had every advantage of position, and overwhelming force of infantry and cavalry, and that we were, becoming completely environed in the meshes of the net set for us, the command was ordered to move up the river, double quick. The gallant field, staff, and line officers acted with decis- ion and promptitude, and the command was moved rapidly off the field, leaving three companies of dismounted men, and perhaps 200 sick and wounded men, in the enemy's possession. Our ar- tillery was doubtless captured at the river, as two horses had been killed in one place, an4 one in each of two others, and the mount- ain path, from which we made our exit, was too precipitous to convey them over. Two lieutenants and five privates were known to have been killed on our side. After leaving the river at Portland, the command was marched to Belleville, some fourteen miles, and commenced fording, or rather swimming, at that point. 330 men had effected a crossing, when again the enemy's gunboats were upon us-the iron-clad. and two transports. Again we moved up the river. The second brigade, commanded by Colonel Adam Johnson, was ordered to cross, guides having represented the stream as fordable. In dashed the colonel, closely followed by Lieutenant Woodson, Captain Paine, of Texas, young Rogers, of Texas, Captain Mc- Clain, A. C. S., second brigade, and myself. IThe colonel's noble mare falters, strikes out again, and boldly makes the shore. Woodson follows. My poor mare, being too weak to carry me, turned over and commenced going down; incumbered by clothes, sabre, and pistols, I made but poor progress in the turbid stream, but the recollection of home, of a brig] t-eyed maiden in the sunny south, the pressing need of soldiers, and an inherent love of life, actuated me to continue swimming  Behind me I heard the piercing call of young Rogers for help; on my right, Captain Helm was appealing to me for' aid; and in the rear, my fiiend, Captain McOlain was sinking. Grad ally the gunboat was near- ing me. Should I be able to hold up until it came; and would I then be saved to again undergo the horrors of a Federal bastile? But I hear soinething behind me snorting! I feel it passing! Thank God I am saved! A riderless 'horse dashes by; I grasp his tail! wward he bears me, and the shore is reached. Colonel Johnson, on reaching the shore, seizes upon a ten-inch piece of board, jumps into a leaky skiff, and starts back to aid the drown- ing. He reachers Captain Helm, but Captai McClain and young   I   APPENDIX.          397 Rogers are gone! Yes, Captain McClain, the true gentleman, faithful soldier, and pleasant companion, has been buried in the depths of the Ohio. We sadly miss him at quarters and in the field. His genial smile and lmerry laughter will no longer ring upon the ear. But from his manly piety and goodness of Iheart, tile angels of heaven will never mark him as an absentee. May the memory of his' many virtues serve as a beacon-light to guide us all to the same heavenly abode where he is now stationed. Two men were drowned in the crossing. The gunboat and transports cutting us off again, General Morgan fell back again, and just as daylight was disappearing, the rear of his command was leaving the river. Sad and dispirited, we impressed guides, collected together 360 men who had crossed-many without arms, having lost them in the river-and marched out towards Claysville. But before leaving the river, I will briefly recapitulate and sum up in shorf order the damage to jthe enemy in this raid, and the  sufferings through which General Morgan's men passed. On first crossing the Cumberland, we detached two companies-one to operate on the Louisville and Nashville railroad, the other to op- erate between Crab Orchard and Somerset, Kentucky. The first captured two trains, and returned to Tennessee. The second cap- tured thirty-five wagons, and also returned. We then detached 100 men at Springfield, who marched to Frankfort and destroyed la train and the railroad near that point. We also captured a train, with a number of officers, on the Louisville and Nashville railroad, near Shepherdsville-sent a detachment around Louis- ville, who captured a number of army supplies, and effected al crossing by capturing a steamer between Louisville and Cincin- nati, and rejoined us in Indiana. We paroled, up to the. 10th, near 6,000 Federals, they obliga- ting themselves not to take up arms durihg the war. We de- stroyed thirty-four important bridges, destroying the track in sixty different places. Our loss was by no means light-28 com- missioned officers killed, 35 wounded, and 250 men killed, wound- ed, and captured. By the Federal accounts, we killed more than 200, wounded at least 350, and captured, as above stated, near 6,000. Thie damage to railroads, steamboats, and bridges, added to the destruction of public stores and depots, cannot fall far short of $10,000,000. We captured three pieces of artillery, and one 24- pounder at Lebanon, which we destroyed; one, a Parrott 3-inch gun, at Brandenburg and a 12-pounder at Portland. These guns     398          APPENDIX. may have fallen into the enemy's hands again; I do not know if it be so, but fear they have. After crossing into Indiana, the inhabitants fled in every direc- tion, women and children begging us to spare their lives, and amazingly surprised to find we were humans. The Copperheads and Butternuts were always in the front opposing us. Occasion- ally we would meet with a pure Southron, general y persons ban- ished from the border States. In Indiana one :recruit was ob- tained, a boy fourteen years old, whol came as ah orderly. Our command was bountifully fed, and I think the people of Indiana and Ohio are anxious for peace; and could the idea of their abil- ity to conquer us once be gotten rid of, they would clamor for an immediate recognition. Every town was illuminated, and the people everywhere rejoicing over the downfall of Vicksburg. Crops of wheat and oats are very good, but corn very poor, indeed. After leaving the Ohio at Belleville, on the night of the 19th, we marched to near Elizabethtown, in Wirt county, from there to Steer creek, and across the mountains to Sutton; from Sutton, on the Gauley Bridge road, to Birch creek, crossing Gauley at the mouth of Cranberry, and thence into the Greenbrier Country, crossing Cold mountain, passing a heavy blockaded road; tired steeds prevented rapid marches, and six days were consumed ere we reached Lewisburg, near which we left Colonel Grigsby, with a detachment, which then numbered about 475 men. From the crossing of the Ohio until our entrance into Gireenbrier, our men lived on beef alone, without salt, and no bread. Yet their only wish seemed to be for the safety of General Morgan and the com- mand. To the kind officers, soldiers, and citizens whom we have met upon our journey, since reaching the Old Dominion, in behalf of our command, we tender them our undying regard, and assure them, if unbounded success has not fallen to our lot this time, that we are more fully determined to strive for our country and cause than ever. I have the honor to remain your obedient servant; I   S. P. CUNNINGHAM, A. A. A. G. Morgan's Cavalry Division. i          i   APPENDIX.          399 GENERAL MORGAN'S ESCAPE. GERNERAL MORGAN made his daring escape from the Ohio Peni- tentiary, generally considered one of the strongest prisons in the country, on the bight of November 27th. The bedsteads of the prisoners were small iron stools, fastened to the wall with hinges. They could be hooked up or allowed to stand on the floor; and to prevent any suspicion, for several days before any work was attempted, they made it a habit to let them down and sit at their doors and read. Oaptajn Hines superintend- ed the work, while General Morgan kept watch to divert the at- tention of the sentinel, whose duty it was to come round during the day and observe if any thing was going on. One day this fel- low came in while Hokersmith was down under the floor boring away, and missing him said, L Where is Hokersmith?"The gen- eral replied, "He is in my room, sick," and immediately pulled a document out of his pocket and said to him: "Here is a memorial I have drawn up to forward to the government at Washington; what do you think of it?" The fellow, who perhaps could not read, being' highly flattered at the general's condescension, took it and very gravely lookeed at it for several moments before he vouchsafed any reply. Then handing it back, he expressed himself highly pleased with it. In the mean time, Hokersmith had been signalled and canme up, pro- fessing to feel " very unwell." This sentinel was the most difficult and dangerous obstacle in their progress, because there was no telling at what time he would enter during the day, and at night he came regularly every two hours to each cell, and inserted a light through the bars of their door, to see that they were quietly sleeping; and frequently after he had completed his rounds lie would slip back in the dark with a pair of india-rubber shoes on, to listen at their cells if any thing was going on. The general says that he would almost invariably know of his presence by a certain magnetic shudder which it would produce; but for fear that this acute sensibility might sometimes fail him, he broke up small parti- cles of coal every morning, and sprinkled them' before the cell door, which would always announce his coming.     400          APPENDIX. Every thing was Inow ready to begin the work; so about the latter part of October they began to bore. All were busy-one making a rope-ladder by tearing and twisting up strips of bedticlk, another making bowie-knives, and another twisting up towels. They labored perseveringly for several days, and after boring through nine inches of cement and nine thicknesses of brick placed edgewise, they began to wonder when they should reach the soft earth. Suddenly a brick fell through. What could this mean? What infernal chamber had they reached? It was immediately entered, and, to their astonishment andjoy, it proved to be an air- chamber extending the whole length of the row of cells. Here was an unexpected interposition in their favor. Hitherto they had been obliged to conceal their rubbish in their bedticks, each day burning a proportionate quantity of straw; now they had room enough for all they could dig. They at once commenced to tunnel at right angles with this air-cham]er, to get through the foundation; and day after day they bored, day after day the blocks of granite were removed, and still the work before them seemed interminable. After 23 days of unremitting labor, and getting through a gran- ite wall of six feet in 'thickness, they reached the soil; They tun- nelled up for some distance, and lightobegan to shine. How glo- rious was that light! It announced the fulfilment of their labors, and if Providence would only continue its favor, they would soon be free. This was the morning of the 26th day of November, 1863. The nextinight, at twelve o'clock, was determined on as the hour at which they would attemnpt their liberty. Each mo- ment that intervened was filled with dreadful anxiety and suspense, and each time the guard entered increased their apprehensions. The general says he had prayed for rain, but the morning of the 27th dawned bright and beautiful. The evening came, and clouds began to gather! How they prayed for them to increase! If rain should only begin, their chances of detection would be greatly lessened. While these thoughts were passing throughl: their minds, the keeper entered with a letter for General Morgan. He opened it, and what was his surprise, and I may say wonder, to find it from a poor Irish woman of his acquaintance in Kentucky, commnencing, "My dear ginral, I feel certain you are going to try to get out of prison, but for your sake don't you try it, my dear ginral. (ou will only be taken prisoner agin, and made to suffer more tpan you do noW." The letter then went on to speak of his kindness to the poor   APPENDIX.           401 when he lived at Lexington, and concluded by again exhorting him to trust in God and wait his time. What could this mean? No human being on the outside had been informed of his intention to escape, and yet, just as all things were ready for him to make the attempt, here comes a letter from Winchester, Ky., advising him not to "try it.' This letter had passed through the examin- ing office of General Mason, and then through the hands of the lower officials. What if it should excite their suspicion and cause them to exercise an increased vigilance? The situation, however, was desperate. Their fate could not be much worse, and they resolved to go. Nothingnow remained to be done but for the General and Colonel Dick Morgan to change cells. The hour ap- proached for them to be locked up. They changed coats, and each stood at the other's cell door with his back exposed, and pretend- ed to be engaged in making up their beds. As the turnkey enter- ed they "turned in" and pulled their doors shut. Six, eight, ten o'clock came. How each pulse throbbed as they quietly awaited the approach of twelve! It came-the sentinel passed his round-all well. After waiting a few moments to see if he intended to slip back, the signal was gi ven-all quietly slipped down into the air-chamber, first stuffing their shirts and placing them in bed as they were accustomed to lie. As they moved quietly along through the dark recess to the terminus where they were to emerge from the earth, the general prepared to light a match. As the lurid glare fell upon their countenances a scene was presented which can never be forgotten. There were crouch- ed seven brave men who had resolved to be free. They were armed with bowie-knives made ogut of case-knives. Life, in their condition, was scarcely to be desired, and the moment for the des- perate chance had arrived.- Suppose, as they emerged from the ground, the dog should give the alarm--they could but die. But a few moments Were spent in this kind of apprehension. The hour arrived, and yet they came. Fortunately-providential - -ly-the night had suddenly grown dark and rainy; the dogs had retired to their kennels, and the sentinels had taken refuge under shelter. The inner wall, by the aid of the rope-ladder, was soon scaled, And now the outer one had to be attempted. Captain Tay- lor (wh6, by the way, is a nephew of old Zack,) being a very ac- tive man, by the assistance of his comrades reached the top of the gate, and was enabled to get the rope over the wall. When the top was gained they found a rope extending all around, which the general immediately cut, as he suspected it might lead into the     402          APPENDIX.  warden's room. This turned out to be correct. They then enter- ed the sentry-box on the wall and changed their clothes, and let themselves down the wall. In sliding down, the general skinned his hand very badly, and alli were more or less bruised. Once down, they separated, Tayloriand Shelton going' one way, Hoker- smith, Bennett, and McGee another, and General Morgan and Cap- tain Hines proceeded immediately towards the depot. The general had, by paying $15 in gold, succeeded in obtaining a paper which informed him of the schedule time of the different roads. The clock struck one, and he knew that by hurrying he could reach the down-train for Cinciniati. He got there just as the train was moving off. He at once looked on to see if there were any soldiers on board, and espying a Union officer, he boldly walked up and took a seat beside him. He remarked to him that as the night was damp and chilly, perhaps he would join him in a drink. He did so, and the party soon became agreeable to each other. The cars, in crossing the Sciota, have to pass within a short distance of the Penitentiary. As they passed, the officer remark- ed, "There's the hotel at which Morgan and his officers are spend- ing their leisure." Yes," replied the general, "and I sincerely hope he will make up his mind to board there during the balance of the war, for he is a great nuisance." When the train reached Zenia, it was detained by some accident more than an hour. Im- agine his anxiety as soldier after soldier would pass through the train, for fear that when the sentinel passed his round at 2 o'clock their absence might be discovered. The train was due in Cincinnati at 6 o'clock. This was the hour in which they were turned out of their cells, and of course their escape would be then discovered. In a few moments after it would be known all over the country. The train, having been detained at Zenia, was running very rapidly to make up the time. It was already past six o'clock. The general said to Captain Hines, "It is after six; if we go to the depot we are dead men. Now or never." They went to the rear and put on the brakes. "Jump, Hines!" Off he went, and fell heels over head in the mud. An- other severe turn of the brakes, and the general jumped. He was more successful, and lighted on his feet. There were some soldiers near, who remarked, "What in the h-- do you mean by jump- ing off the cars here?"The general replied, "What in the h-- is the use of my going into town when I live here; and, besides, what business is it of yours?" They went immediately to the river. They found a skiff, but   APPENDIX.           403 no oars. Soon a little boy came over, and appeared to be wait- ing. "What are you waiting for?" said the general. "I am wait- ing for my load." "What is -the price of a load?" "Two dol- lars." "Well, as we are tired and hungry, we'll give you the two dollars, and you can put us over." So over he took them. "Where does Miss -   live?" "Just a short distance from here." "Will you show me her house?" "Yes, sir." The house was reached, a fine breakfast was soon obtained, money and a horse furnished, a good woman's prayer bestowed, and off he went. From there, forward through Kentucky, everybody vied with each other as to who should show him the most attention-even to the negroes; and young ladies of refinement begged the honor to cook his meals. He remained in Kentucky some days, feeling perfectly safe, and sending into Louisville for many little things he wanted. Went to Bardstown, ind found a Federal regiment had just arrived there looking for him. Remained here and about for three or four days, and then struck out for Dixie, sometimes disguising himself as a  government cattle contractor, and buying a large lot of cattle, at other times a quartermaster, until he got to the Tennessee river. Here he found all means of transportation destroyed, and the bank strongly guarded, but with the assistance of about thirty others, who had recognized him and joined him in spite of his remon- strances, he succeeded in making a raft, and he and Captain Hines crossed over. His escort, with heroic self-sacrifice, refused to cross until he was safely over. He then hired a negro to get his horse over, paying him $20 for it. The river was so high that the horse came near drowning, and after more than one hour's struggling with the stream, was pulled out so exhausted as scarce- ly to be able to stand.  The general threw a blanket on him and commenced to walk him, when suddenly, he says, he was seized with a presentiment that he would be attacked, and remarking to Captain Hines, "'We will be attacked in twenty minutes," commenced saddling his horse. He had hardly tied his girth, when "bang, bang," went the Minie balls. He bounced his horse, and the noble animal, ap- pearing to be inspired with new vigor, bounded off like a deer up the Mountain. The last he saw of his poor fellows on the oppo- site side, they were disappearing up the river-bank, fired upon by a whole regiment of Yankees. By this time it was dark, and also raining. He knew that a perfect cordon of pickets would surround the foot of the mountain, and if he remained there until morning, li      404          APPENDIX. he would be lost. So he determined to run the gauntlet at once, and commenced to descend. As he neared the foot, leading his horse, he came almost in personal contact with a picket. His first impulse was to kill him, but finding him asleep, he determinedf to let him sleep on. He made his way to the house of a Union man that he knew lived near there, a(nd went up and passed himself oft as Captain Quartermaster of Hunt's regiment, who was on his way to Athens, Tenn., to procure supplies of sugar and coffee for the Union people of the country. The'lady, who appeared to be asleep while this interview was taking place with her husband, at the mention of sugar and coffee, jumped out of bed in her niglit clothes, and said, "Thank God for that, for we ain't seen any rale coffee up here for God knows how long!"She was so delighted at the prospect, that she made up a fire and cooked them a supper. Supper being over, the general remarked that he understood some rebels had " tried to cross the river this afternoon." "Yes," said the woman, "but our men killed some un urn, and driv the rest back." "Now," says the general, "I know that, but didn't some of them get over?" "Yes," was her reply, "but they are on the mountain, and can't get down without being killed, as every road is stopped up." He then said to her: "It is very important for me to get to Athens by to-morrow night, or I may lose that sugar and coffee, and I am afraid to go down any of these roads, for fear my own men will kill me." The fear of losing that sugar and coffee brought her again to an accommodating mood, and she replied,( "Why, Paul, can't you show the captain through our farm, that road down by the field?" The general says, "Of course, Paul, you can do it, and as the night is very cold, I will give you $10 (in gold) to help you along." The gold, and the prospect of sugar and coffee, were too much for any poor man's nerves, and lie yielded, and getting on a horse, lie took then seven miles to the big road. From this time forward he had a series of adventures and escapes, all very wonderful, until he got near another river in Tennessee, when he resolved to go up to a house and find the way. Hines went to the house, while the general stood in the road. Hearing a body of cavalry come dashing up behind him, he quietly slipped to one side of the road and it passed by without observing him. They went travelling after Hines, and, poor fellow, he has not been heard of since. How sad to think he should be either captured or killed, after so many brave efforts, not only in his own behalf, but also in that of the general, for the general says that it is ow-   APPENDIX.           405 ing chiefly to Hines's enterprise and skill that they made their es- cape. When he arrived at the river referred to above, lie tried to get over, intending to stop that. night with a good Southern man on the other side. He codld not get over, and had to stop at the house of a Union man. The next morning he went to the house that he had sought the night previous, and found the track of the Yankees scarcely cold. They had been there all night, expecting that he would come there, and had murdered everybody who had attempted to reach the house without hailing them. In pur- suing this brutal course, they had killed three young men, neigh- bors of this gentleman, and went away, leaving their dead bodies on the ground. After he had crossed Okey's river, and got down into middle Tennessee, he found it almost impossible to avoid recognition. At one time he passed some poor women, and one of them commenced clapping her hands, and said, "Oh, I know who that isl" but catching herself, she stopped short, and passed on with her com- panions. The general says that his escape was made entirely without the assistance from any one on the outside, and, so far as he knows, also without their knowledge of his intention; that the announce- ment of his arrival at Toronto was one of those fortuitous coinci- dences that cannot be accounted for; that it assisted him mate- rially, no doubt. In fact, he says that his " wife's prayers" saved him, and, Ks this is the most agreeable way of explaining it, he is determined to believe it. The above account may be relied on as correct; and, although much has been left out, yet enough is printed to stamp it as one of the most remarkable escapes in history. I I     406          APPENDIX. MORGAN'S JOURNEY THROUGH EKENTUCKIY. S. 0. REID, the correspondent of 'he Atlanta Intelligencer, had an interview with Captain Henry T. Hines, at Dalton, Ga., on the 4th inst., and obtained the particulars of his capture, escap? from the Ohio Penitentiary, and return to Dixie. As the publje are familiar with the circumstances of the capture, &c., we c nfine our extracts to the thrilling incidents of the return to the Confed- eracy in company with General Morgan, which will amply repay perusal. It had been previously determined that, on reaching the outer walls, the parties should separate, Morgan and Hines together, and the others to shape their course for themselves. Thus they parted. Hines and the general proceeded at once to the depot to purchase their tickets for Cincinnati. But, lo! where was the money? The inventive Hines had only to touch the magical wand of his inge- nuity, to be supplied. While in lprison he had taken the precau- tion, after planning his escape, to write to a lady friend in a peculiar cipher, which, when handed to the authorities to read through openly, contained nothing contraband, but which, on the young lady receiving, she, according to instructions, sent him some books, in the back of one of which she concealed some "greenbacks," and across the inside wrote her name, to indicate the place where the money was deposited I The books came safe to hand, and Hines was flush I Going boldly up to the ticket- office, while Morgan modestly stood back and adjusted a pair of green goggles over his eyes, which one of the men having weak eyes had worn in the prison. They took their seats in the cars without suspicion. Ho their hearts beat until the locomotive whistled to startl! Slovly the wheels turn, and they are off! The cars were due in Cincinnati at 7 A. M. At Dalton, Ohio, they were detained one hour. ,What keen anguish of suspense did they hot suffer-l They knew that at 5 o'clockl I M. the convicts would be called, and that the escape would then be discovered, when it would be telegraphed in every direction; consequently the guards would be ready to greet them on their arrival. They were rapidly nearing the city of Abolition hogdom. It was a cool, rainy morning. Just as the train entered i"   APPENDIX.          407 the suburbs, about a half a mile from -the depot, the two escaped prisoners went out on the platform and put on the brakes, check- ing the cars sufficiently to let them jump off. Hines jumped off first, and fell, considerably stunned. Morgan' followed unhurt. They immediately made towards the river, striking it at Ludlow's Ferry. Here they found a boy with a skiff, whbo had just ferried across some ladies from Covington. They dared not turn their heads, for fear of seeing the guards coming. "Hines," whispered the general, "look and see if anybody is coming!"The boy was told that they wanted to cross, but he desired to wait for more passengers. The general told him that he was in a hurry, and promised to pay double fare. The skiff shot out in-to the stream, they soon reached the Kentucky shore, and breathed free I The boy had told them the place of residence of a lady friend; thither they bent their steps, and were received with the wildest demonstrations o joy and hospitality. They were afraid to tarry long. Horses were immediately procured for them, and that day, the 28th November, they rode to the town of Union, in Boone county, twenty-eighlt miles from Covington. There they stayed all night and the next day, leaving on the night of the 29th, with volun- teer guides, and travelling by neighborhood and by-roads, passing through Gallatin county to Owen county line, where they stopped with a friend and spent the day of the 80th. They resumed their travels at night, passing through New Liberty; crossed the Ken' tucky river, and at 2 A. M., on the 1st December, stopped twelve miles the other side of Newcastle. Pushing on that day, they arrived at nightl eight miles this side of Shelbyville, where they spent the day of the 2d with their friends, meeting with a glbrious reception. At night they departed again, passing through Taylors- ville, and reached the vicinity of Bardstowh on the morning-of the 3d. Here they remained over until the nighteof the 5th, having received a most cordial greeting and unboundediospitality. Again advancing, they passed through glorious old Nelson county, stop- ping on Rolling Fork. On the 5th, they laid over, and at night reached the vicinity of Greensburg, passing between the pickets of the enemy and their base. The fugitives had been joined by four others, and the party now consisted of six. They remained concealed inside of the enemy's pickets during the day of the 6th. Their trip through Kentucky had been one grand ovation, the ladies going wild with joy, and the men offering them every thing in their power, showing that the true spirit still breathes in that down-trodden State.     408       i   APPENDIX. On the night of the 6th they procured guides to proceed to the Cumberland river, the road being thickly lined with Yankees. At ten A. M., on the 7th, they reached the Cumberland, nine miles "S Ibelow Burksville, having travelled sixty miles -that night, and crossed the river-in a canoe, swimming their horses and passing for Federal cavalry. That night they stayed at the house of a good Union friend, who, supposing them to belong to Jacobs' cav- alry, took the best care of them. On the 8th, they passed into Overton county, Tennessee, following in the rear of a large Yankee scouting party, who, they learned, were in hot chase after Morgan! The'general here learning that a number of escaped prisoners of his command were in the vicinity, a portion being under Captain Ray, he determined to wait until they could be collected, and then take them out, for which purpose he laid over until the 12th of December.    I The squad was now increased to forty men, under command of Captain Hines, and crossing a spur of the Cumnberland by way of Crossville, between Sparta and Knoxville, they arrived at Bridge's ferry, on the Tennessee river, at ten o'clock on the Inorning of the 13th. There being no boat or skiff to cross, the party was compelled to fell trees to make a raft. This ferry was within two miles and a half of a Yankee cavalry camp, By two P. M.'they had succeeded in crossing twenty-five men and six horses. At this time a cavalry force of the enemy appeared on the north side of the river, and fired upon the party who had been engaged in making the raft. The enemy succeeded in capturing three or four men, but the others made their escape back into Tennessee. At the same moment the enemy also appeared on the south side of the river, when General Morgan, Hines, and four others mounted their horses to escape. After riding two miles and a half from the river, Hines rode up to a house for the purpo3e of procuring a guide, leaving Morgan and the other iren in the road. Hines had ob- tained the guide, when he heard Morgan halloo tq him, and soon after a party of cavalry dashed up towards Hines, which at first he took for a party of our men, until they approached so close that escape was impossible. Hines had on a Yankee gun-cloth which covered his clothes, and seeing that they took him for an "Abolish," he feigned to be a Yankee. The Abolish captain "Where are the rebels.?" asked the captain. "They have just gone down thi's road; come on, andt we will catch them,' .said Hines, riding off in the opposite direction from that taken by i                     ,   ,    . I *   APPENIDIX.          409 I Morgan, who, at the time, was near the foot of the hill, and was thus enabled to escape. The party followed Hines, but soon after discovered him to 'be a true rebel, and taking away his arms they i threagened to hang him for misleading therm. lines was carried across the river to their camps, and put under guard. He passed off for a private under the name of Bullitt. That night he ate up several letters and private papers, besides thie notes of his trip, which would have condermned him, thus making a paper supper, which probably saved his neck. On the evening of the 14th the captain returned from the scout, and re- ported that the rebels had escaped. He had learned from a citizen  that Morgan was one of the party, and suspected Hines of being an escaped prisoner. He charged him with being a Confederate- officer, and questioned him very closely. In order to gain Hines's confidence, and to pump him, he treated him very kindly, and asked/bim to go to a Union man's house to take supper. On leaving the house, about nine p. M., whiph was half a mile from the camp, after getting off about ten steps, the "Yank" remem- bered he had left his shawl, and went back. The night was dark, and Hines struggled with himself to gain his consent to escape, but considering the confidence and kindness of the officer, he con- eluded to wait until he got out of hid hands. Hines remained in camp under guard during the night'of the 14th, and the next morn- ing was sent to Kingston, with an escort of ten men, where he *as placed in jail, and kept for five days without fire, and almost with- out food. Here he found three of his comrades who had been cap- tilred on the other side of the river. On the 20th, he and his three companions, William and Robert Church, and Smith, of the third Kentucky Cavalry, were sent to the camp of the Third Yankee Kentucky Infantry, opposite Loudon, on the Tennessee river, nine- teen miles from Kingston. The prisoners were confined in a small tlo Se in the centre of the camp, the timber being cut down in every direction for half a mile, and there being but one path leading to the mountain from  the camp, which was closely guarded. That night it was bright moonlight, but the moon went down just before daylight. Hines and his companions, by agreement; under pretence of being very cold, dressed themselves at the time, and sat down with the guards round the fire. At a given signal his comrades rose and stood round the fire, while Hines, keeping one of the guards busily engaged talking, quietly approached the door unob- served, raising the latch,!giving the wink at the same time to his 18     l "O          APPENDIX. friends. Then turning suddenly, he threw the door wide open,; and said, with composure, "Gentlemen, we have remained here long enough; it is time we were going." The guards were struck dumb with surprise, and thought it a joke. But before they could recover their senses, Hines flew past the guards in front of the house, and ran like a deer for the woods. He heard a struggle for a moment near the house, and then-a volley of Minie balls whizzed by him. His three comrades must have been caught. The enemy pursued him to the wood and up the mountain for three-quarters of a miie, when they lost his track. Hines travelled six miles across the mountains that morning, and lay concealed during the day. At night he approached a house in a valley, and finding the occupant a Unionist, he passed himself off'as a Yankee govern- ment agent. In conversing about the rebels, the Unionist said there were a few still lurking about, but as the river was well guarded, there were but few places they could cross at, and men- tioned one place five miles below Loudon, where he said a rebel lived who kept a canoe. Hines made an excuse to go out that night, and proceeded to the ferry indicated, where he found the canoe and crossed the river. He soon found many friends on the south side of the river to aid him, and travelling altogether by night till out of danger, he finally arrived at Dalton, Ga., on the evening of the 29th December, having walked the whole distance from Loudon.        .     i'   APPENDIX.           4" THE CAPTURE OF MORGAN.* sin your paper! of the 13th of February, this notice appears: "Brigadier-general Shackelford, who captured Morgan, has re- signed." You are not the first who has been led to believe Gen- eral Shackelford deserves all, or the greater part, of the praise due in that "affair." That "honor may be given, where honor is due," and that your readers may become acquainted with'the facts, and judge for themselves, I give below a plain statement of the whole matter as it came to my knowledge, and for which I can vouch. Before Morgan crossed th6 Cumberland river, Brigadier-gen- eral Judah, commanding the Second division of Twenty-third arnhy corps, ordered Brigadier-general E. H. Hobson, command- ing Second brigade of Second division, to move from Columbia to Glasgow, Kentucky. When he arrived within five miles of Glas- gow, he received orders from General Judah to move with the Second brigade to Tompkinsville-that he, Judah, had left for Scottsville, south of Big Barren river, and expected to attack Morgan at Carthage, Tennessee. General Hobson arrived with his command at Ray's Cross Roads, eighteen miles from Glasgow. Leaving his infantry at this place, he proceeded to Tompkinsville, with six hundred cavalry, and occupied the place, until General Judah could cross Barren river and join him at Tompkinsville. When General Judah arrived, General Hobson reported to him that Morgan was moving up the Cumberland, and would cross at Burksville. Hobson insisted on General Judah giving him orders to move immediately to Burksville, and prevent Morgan's crossing into Kentucky. Judah gave him orders tq move his brigade to Marrow-Bone, ten miles southwest of B ksville, and holi the place at all hazards, until further ordersN Hobsoa arrived at Marrow-Bone on the 1st of July, his advance driving the Rebel pickets from the place. On the 2d 'of July, at daylight, Hobson's picket line was attacked, and the Rebels repulsed. Duribg the whole of that day Hobson fought Morgan's command. He also F* rom the Army and Navy Journal.  "     "2          APPENDIX. ascertained that Morgan was crossing his force at Burksville and Cloyd's Ferry, nine miles below; Burksville. Hobson informed Judah of his movements; and of Ithe movements of Morgan, and stated that he had ordered General Shackelford's brigade from Ray's Cross Roads to assist him. Shackelford arrived at Marrow-Bone at 12 P. M. July 2ld. Hobson did not put him on duty, but told him to rest and feed his men, and be ready to move at an early hour next morning; that he would attack Morgan's command next morning at Oloyd's Ferry, and prevent him from uniting his two brigades; this he would do in violation of General Judah's orders, as it was the only way to prevent Morgan from entering and devastating the State. Hobson dispatched General Judah, who was then sup- posed to be at Ray's Cross Roads, fourteen miles in the rear, his plans, and the disposition he intended to make of his forces, and stated it was in violation of orders i heretofore received." Gen- eral Judah met the courier six miles from Marrow-Bone, and sent an aide at full speed, with verbal orders to General Hobson, to. suspend all military operations, and to countermand all orders for the moving of troops. General Hobson reluctantly obeyed, and stated to General Judah that Morgan would unite his forces, and. get considerably the start, if he (Judah) did not order the troops to move and attack Morgan. After delaying one brigade twelve, and another twenty-four hours, General Judah adopted "Hobson s second plan; to cross the country, sending one brigade through Columbia, and one through Greensburgh, to unite at Campbellsville.  Judah returned to Glasgow. i Hobson  and 'Shackelford united at Campbellsville, and proceeded to Lebanon, Kentucky, leaving Judah south of Green river, he having failed to cross his cavalry before the river became too high. General Burnside telegraphed to General Hobson to assume command of all the cavalry at Lebanon, consisting of his own, Shackelford's, Woolford's, and Kants"' commands, and to pursue and capture Morgan; and to impress horses, subsistence, &c., for his corn- mand. Upon receiving this order Hobson continued the pursuit, and directed all the movements of the troops under him. IMorgan having stripped the country, through which he passed, of hors-es, &c., Hobson labored under many disadvantages, iut pushed alead, determined to attack Morgan with fifteen rnen--4f no more than that number could keep up with him. At Buffin-g- ton Island, on the 19th of July, Hobson attacked, routed, scat- tered, and whipped Mdrgan; having followed him for twenty-one   APPENDIX.    x       413 da ys and nights. Hobson leading in the fro t when the attack was mrade, was convinced that Morgan could not cross the river, and would attempt to get to the rear, and take the back track. T( prevent this, Hobson sent orders to General Shackelford and Colonel Woolford to occupy positions four miles from the river, ard. attack Morgan's force, part of which was moving to that piint. Also to pursue in every direction,'and lose no time in capturing Morgan's scattered and routed forces. These orders were promptly obeyed, and resulted at this point in the' capture of four hundred and seventy-five men. Colonels Kants, Sanders, and Lieutenant-colonel Adams had similar orders to follow up Morgan's scattered force, and drive them in the direction of Shackelford and Woolford, all of whom, in obeying these orders, captured quite a number of prisoners.  It is evident that General Hobson was in command of the expe- dition from the time he left Lebanon, until its close, as he had been placed in command by Major-general Burnside, and received no countermanding orders; although it is true he did receive instructions or- information from time to time from Generals Burnside and Boyle.             : Major Rue, of the Ninth Kentucky cavalry, is the officer who captured Morgan in person; Sergeant Drake, of the Eighth Mich- igan cavalry, and a sergeant of the Ninth Michigan cavalry, cap- tured Colonel Basil Duke, Colonel Howard Smith, and one hun- dred and sixty line-officers and privates. General Hobson could not, of course, lead in every direction after he had lbroken up and routed Morgan at Blffington Island. It was his duty to see to his wounded; give orders to the pur- suing parties, and see that the prisoners were' properly secured and cared for, as well as other details, that none but a command- ing general are likely to be familiar with, or think of. There are many other interesting incidents concerning, the action'of Generals. Hobson, Shackelford, Manson, and Judah, Col- onels Woolford, Kants, and others; but it is not my purpose to go into a detailed history, further than to give-what I hptve en- deavored to give above-a plain and truthful statement of facts connected with the pursuit and capture of the rebel General John 1i. Morgan. i '      "4 "4          APPENIDIX. MORGAN, THE HOPE OF THE WEST. THE war-cloud hung lurid and dark, And terror each soul did assail, When anon with fury it burst, Sending forth a heartrending wail. Mothers to their offspring did cling, Fair maidens did beat on their breasts, For the hordes and freebooting bands Of Lincoln did ravage the West. Hearts in supplication arose, That God some deliverance might bring, When lo I a brave leader appears, Whose advent in chorus now sing; For no common leader is he; High towering amongst all the rest, No brand with such terror does flash, As Morgan's, the hope of the West. His advent the Yankees did scorn, And dubbed him with every vile name,  Guerilla, land-pirate, outlaw, Whom naught but a halter could tame. But dearer this leader became To every Confederate breast, And never did star brighter shine Than Morgan, the hope of the West. To Abe, this brave chieftain appeared A iend of ubiquitous dread; A whole mint he'd most freely give, The price of this hobgoblin's head. For oft while his minions feel safe, Far, far from this foe to their rest, Destruction would leap like a flash,- 'Tis Morgan, the hope of the West.   APPENDIX.          415 Whilst fear, consternation, and, dread, The freebooting hordes sore oppressed, Bright Hope, with soft pinions, did fan The hearts of fair maidens distressed. A shout, now spontaneous arose From every ond Southern breast, No champion of Freedom's so bold, As Morgan, the hope of the West.  -  -, I GENERAL MORGAN'S KENTUCKY HOLIDAY RAID. IT'S of chivalrous Morgan I propose to sing, And of the brave heroes that round him do cling, Whose valor has thrilled the heart of the nation, Whose prowess astounds this lower creation; But 'mongst his brave deeds, that most worthy of praise Was his dash in Kentuck during holidays. The enemy held this entire neutral soil, And each true Southron was the victim of spoil. The heart of brave Morgan beat high in his breast, As the plume of the tyrant waved in his crest, te vowed that his State should be happy and free, And his watchword was death to all tyranny. Many brave hearts had flocked to this hero bold, From that doomed State that to the despot was sold, Many others, likewise from States further south, Whose hands they had torn from the gorilla's mouth. With this heroic band of brave volunteers, Whose free hearts were strangers to unmanly fears, He set out for Kentuck with high beating heart, Determined to baffle the enemy's art; With speed far surpassing the old warrior's code, 'By day and by night we vigorously rode, No halting our horses, so weary, to unsaddle, That our foeman might have no time to skedaddle. We eagerly attacked each bristling stockade- For railroad defence these strongholds were made,-     "6          APPENDIX. But they all surrendered, even seven or more, And prisoners very numerous,-yea, many a score. Thus, by boldly baffling the enemy's wiles, Their railroad we destroyed for forty long miles; Far had we entered the terror-stricken State, Where tyranny guards every iron-barred gate; But the object achieved of this bold foray, To the South we'd return without delay. The enemy's r:ge now with fury did burn, That to the So th they swore we should never return; So they fiercely beset us on every hand, In hopes of de troying our heroic band, Each highway they guarded with a numerous host, Each far more numerous than Morgan could boast. Destruction seemed certain, and conquest most sure, As we appeare4 now entrapped by the enemy's lure; 3 it Morgan was there, whose wits never fail him, Who's always at home when dangers assail him: JBy by-ways he led us that cold, dreary night, And this snarl we escaped by next morning's light; Each day and each night it was common to hear,  "The foe are pursuing-are fighting our rear;" The fire we returned, yet right onward we sped, Though risks we did run, every danger we fled. Thus dangers we escaped and conquest we made, In this brilliant Kentuck, this holiday raid. Some mishaps we met with, some few men we lost, But each gallant life cost the foeman a host; A sad mischance occurred to the heroic Duke, Who's as bold as a lion, but mild as St. Luke: This braveihero, who is scarce less than Morgan, Was severely wounded on the cranial organ, While repelling an attack made on his rear, He fell by a shell that exploded too near; But long may he live, a terror to the foe, For he will perform all that valor can do. One incident more I will here barely note, Like that the old Muses so fondly did quote. Of brave Captain Treble and another as bold, Whose deeds are equal to the heroes of old. They met in combat, three champions to two, Whom fiercely they fought, and a colonel they slew;   APPENDIX.           417 The others surrendered, but almost too late, For the weapon was poised to seal the sad fate Of one, the most daring of that vanquished band, As prostrate he lay under bold Treble's hand. Colonel Halsey fell by brave Eastin's fire; The doom of the rest was less fatally dire: Was that of prisoners whor surrender in war To a foe more generous than tyrants by far. But now, having returned to true Southern soil,  We are calmly reposing after our toil; But Morgan, our leader, is still scenting his game, And soon he will have us pursuing the same. Long, long may he live, this true son of Mars, And triumphantly wave the Stars and the Bars, And each Southern sister in glory arrayed, Recline most gracefully beneath its wide shade. 18* / I
