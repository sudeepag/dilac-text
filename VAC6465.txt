A prolific subject, indeed-and one which, to ;do it justice, requires an amount of labor, care, experience, and appli- ,eation, of which the uninitiated can form but a very vague opinion. Within the past ten years, New York has changed more rapidly than any other city ever did-changed not only in its material extent and physical aspect, but in its moral tone and composition, and especially in ts relative position in respect to the other great cities of the world. Ten years ago-we speak not of the last century, a field of comment aand wonderment sufficiently occupied by the Laurie Twaddlers of the last and present generations-ten. years ago, New York was still en- gaged in the struggle for metropolitan supremacy. Philadelphia and Boston--the one on account of its manufactures and former position, and the other on account of its railroads and intellectual activity--each -contended stoutly for the palm, and did not consent to pass into the rank of secondary cities but after a long and bitter contest. Even now, some ambitious frog, in one or other of 'these small ponds, occa-. sionally swells up to an unusual size, and tells the world that it is at' as big as the ox. These harmless demonstrations, however, are only indulged in by the "young mothers" of the provincial press.. The respectable and experienced Inatrons--as well as the: rest of the world- have settled down in the. comforable conclusion, that New York is "some pumpkins," and that this is the only place where the "Elephant" ban be seen in all his glory. It was, in fact, a necessity for so large and controlling an empire as the United States, to have a centre-a metropolis. A nation is but the symbol of the individual. There must be a head-a heart--as well as body, limbs, and muscles. Nations. do not progtess merely by physical A*.. "     8     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. extension. The great interests of fashion, society,' art, literature-in a word, the realm of genius and the imagination-must be developed step by step with the material growth, or civilization retrogrades to barbarism, and its highest achievements are worth no more, in the great game of life, than the battles of the Indians on the prairies, or the buffalo htnts at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.- Well New York being, then, the admitted metropolis of the New World, we can easily understand the intense interest which attaches to its slightest movements. It is in this view that the present task is undertaken, and if we, do not succeed in conveying to the public who read these sketches, a better idea of the real character of the various classes of society and occupations in New York than they can obtain elsewhere, why, we shall have failed to accomplish what we set about. At all events, you will lose nothing by giving us a trial. Let us start, then, without further preface. THE CRYSTAL PALACE-OUTSIDE. Your chief motive, of course, in coming to New York at the present time, was to see the Crystal Palace. Not that you had any very cor- rect or decided idea as to what the Crystal Palace was or is-but that, as every body has been for some months past talking and writing about. the Crystal Palace, and as you have been told that all the world is to be there, you naturally feel that you ought to be there too; and so, here you are. Of course, you have put up at the  Hotel. (We don't men- tion'the name, for fear of being accused of partiality) Let us take an omnibus, and make our .initial visit to tho precincts of the Crystal Palace. And, by tht way, it would be well to commence by giving you some accurate information in respect to the various means of reaching the Palace. We will take our stand at St. Paul's, and describe things one by one. There go the Sixth avenue stages, white and red, or entirely red. There are two lines-the "Empire," and the "Waverly n The former go up Broadway to Ninth street, then down Ninth to the Sixth avenue, and so up the avenue to the Crystal Palace-passing directly by one of the principal entrances, and the most eligible of all. The "Waverly" line goes down Eighth street to Sixth avenue-not down Waverly Place, as one would naturally suppose. The "Amity street and Seventh avenue" stages, (omnibuses are always called stages in New York,) pass up Broadway to Amity street--down Amity-through Sixth and Green- wich avenues, to Seventh, and so within one square of the Palace. These stages are white, with dark-blue lettering. The various Eighth avenue" lines of stages go within two squares of the Palace-all but the old Bleecker street, or "Knickerbocker" line, which stops at Twenty-third- stredt. The Sixth avenue stages all stop at Twenty-third street to change horses, which we consider to be a great bore, although probably they don't. Then there are'tjhe Fifth avenue stages, (dark-blue, with red or yel- low letters,) and the Broadway, (white, with red letters,) which take-   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         9 you near enough to the Palace, for all practicaipurposes. Besides these there are the railroads-the Sixth and Eighth avenue, especially. These start a car a minute from the corner of Chanbers street, (run- ning down by the upper end of the Park, and past the Irving House,) and take passengers through a most pleasant part of the city, and over a smooth, rapid-running track. The Sixth avenue cars take you directly to the Palace, and are of course the most eligible. If you find yourself too far up town for these, you can take a car at the corner of Broadway ,i ,  and Canal street belonging to either of these lines, and coming on to the principal track at Varick street. A car belonging to each of these lines is always standing at Canal street, and is despatched the moment its successor arrives. They leave about once in three minutes, and are a great convenience. We have now shown you the principal means by regular public con- veyance, of reaching the Crystal Palace: And there is one thing we wish you particularly to observe-it is, that every omnibus and car in New York, always goes irrevocably according to the direction painted on it. If you enter a car, or stage, having "Sixth avenue" painted on it, you may be sure it goes to the Sixth avenue. You need ask no questions and have no fear. Every public vehicle goes exactly according to its label; and a little attention to this will save a world of anxiety and vexation. In coming down town, however, from the Palace, you must take care to distinguish between the cars which run only to Canal street, and those which go clear through to Chambers street. If you don't, you will give yourself, perhaps, half a mile walk for nothing. As to getting about town, in a cab, you had better make a bargain with the driver before you start. If you wish to stop on the way, engage him by the hour-one dollar for the first, and seventy-five cents for every succeeding hour. Otherwise, twenty-five cents each person, every time you stop. If any driver attempts to impose upon you, pay him all he asks, and take down the number of his carriage. Your own statement, at the Mayor's Ofice, in the southwest room of teh City Hall, will re- fund your money and fine the owner of the carriage $5. The moment the driver sees, by your acquiescing in his demands, and taking down is ,number, that you are up to the trap, he will come down. A know- ledge of these little points is an absolute security against imposition and extortion; and those who neglect to inform themselves on the sub- ject, have no claim on our sympathies. While on the subject of omnibuses, cabs, public conveyances, &c., &c., we may as well inform the stranger of the minute details of the process of getting to his hotel from the railroad or steamboat landing. If you go to a first class hotel, you had better,by all means, see the driver of the coach belonging to that hotel. Give him your checks, seat yourself in his coach, and you have no more trouble. He will look after your - baggage much sharper than you could do yourself, and will take every possible care of you-his recompense being an extra twenty-five cents, which you had better not pay yourself, as you will find it charged in your bill all the same. If, however, you choose a cab, all you have to do is to take a look over the crowd, select a fellow with an honest face, take Mis card, and hold it up so that all the others can see it. There is honor among     10     FIFTEEN MNUTES ABOUND NEW YORK. cabmen, as well as among thieves; and as soon as they see that you have a card, they will let you alone. You may give your checks to the driver, if you please, but we should advise you to go with him yourself, to go to the MZIayor's Office and make a complaint, when the money will. be refunded, and the owner of the vehicle fined $5. We have now rshown you how to get to your hotel without being plundered-now for a cruise "about town." ret    * C..-,*..   , . A.. . , CHAPTER II. THE COUP D'OEIL OF THE PALACE-INSIDE. FOR some blocks we have been aware, by the accumulation of coffee houses, grog-shops, "saloons," peep-shows of living alligators, model- artists and three-headed calves, that we were approaching the newly- discoverd, Sedgwickian centre of the metropolis. "Fortieth street- Crystal Palace"-says the conductor, stopping the cars handily on the crossing. You get out, and raising your eyes, you are for a moment transfixed with delight and .wonder at the beautiful dome, rising from the centre of the Palace, and hanging in air as lightly as a new-blown bubble, which the next breath will undulate to and fro. The defect of the Palace, architecturally considered, is the lateral retreating walls, which, from a central front view, give it an insignificant appearance; but from. the corner of either Fortieth or Forty-second street, this de- fect is lost sight of, and the entire structure fills you with its grandeur as well as grace and'beauty.  Let us pass by the southern entrance, and round to the entrance on Forty-second street. Here we go, through a patent revolving regis- tering gateway, which keeps accurate tally of all who go through. It is an English contribution to the Fair, and is an ingenious contrivance -unnecessarily clumsy and massive, however, Going straight down the North Nave, we are soon arrested by the opening extent and mag- nificence of the view. In the centre stands the colossal equestrian statue of Washington, by Morochetti, grandly overlooking the scene. It has been much and ignorantly criticised. Those who have spoken disparagingly of it, appear for the most part to be ignorant of the-fact that a colossal statue can only be justly judged from a proper stand- point. The true'critic can create this stand-point in his own mind, and can therefore see the real beauties and defects of the work, and the real effect it would produce when viewed from the point intended by the artist. The uninitiated, however, do not possess this faculty-a gift closely allied to the creative power of the artist himself. But, un- fortunately, many of them do profess the faculty of writing, and getting printed what they write. So the perceptions of the mass, but just awakening to the light of art, are beclouded and obscured, and incal- culable damage is done to the cause of popular refinement. Maro- chetti's statue, though not faultless, is, on the whole, a noble work. It contains many points of great excellence-and especially the mien, atti- tide, and expression of Washington are truly admirable. The grub- bing critics see nothing but the warrior's breeches-and their modesty is terribly shocked. They would find more congenial studies in the "Living Models" across the way.     12     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. 'le next object that strikes the attention is the "Lion and Amazon' of Kiss. This is a group already celebrated in Europe, and we will not criticise it in detail. It has great beauties, and one or two defects quite unaccountable in so true an artist-for instance, the right thigh. of the Horse is much too small, and the left leg of the Amazon consid- erably too long. The agonized terror of the Horse, the clinging tena- city of the Lion, the hold of the Amazon's hand upon the mane, and the high-poised lance aimed unerringly at the monster's eye, are mag- nificent. But if you want your heart to beat faster than usual, take a position about fifteen steps from the statue, in a northwest direction, and examine well the head, face, the attitude, and the form of the .Ama- zon herself. Ah I what a woman! Full of strength, courage, self- possession-not a line of fear in form or feature-her round and flexible form, beneath whose elastic flesh you can see the heart beat and the firm bosom sink and swell with the half-suspended breath-she looks the very goddess Bellona imagined by the ancients, (who, confound them, imagined everything, and left us to imitate.) But now let your glance glide softly down that glorious form, and across to the knee and foreshortened thigh, towards you. They are the limbs of a young girl,. that never encountered aught more terrible than her mother's lap. So tender, so infantile in their round, unconscious voluptuousness-so plump I It makes you faint to look. And herein is the genius of the artist mostly displayed: that while he has succeeded in endowing his. Amazon with all the strength, and courage, and physical dexterity; demanded by the occasion, he has still exquisitely preserved all the fas- cinating femininity of the woman. What a lesson to our "strong- minded women!"  We now go back a little, and wander delightedly along a row of those snowy marble children of art contributed by Italy to this noble' Gallery of Sculpture-for so it is, with a world of costly stuffs and pro- ductions of human skill, profusely piled round for a back-ground. We must not dare to pause but a moment before each one-or the day, the week, would be consumed in silent admiration or dreaming reverie, and not a line would' be-written. There-see that Flute-player I Was ever anything so perfect?-the two small, girlish breasts pressed together by the attitude of the lovely arms holding the flhte to the lips--don't you see the white, firm flesh palpitate? No 1 Well, we do-and that's enough for us I Then what think you of this upright, self-poised figure of "Truth," naked and pure as a beam of light in the blue sky-looking at herself in a silver mirror? Do you see anything immodest in that figure? Would you do anything but admire and, reverence it, for worlds, if it were this moment to become alive, and look at you with those immaculate eyes? No, for your life you dare not. Apollo would transfix you with a fiery arrow, could you but dream of such presumption. There lies a sleeping babe-oh, how beautiful, how pure, how inno- cent, how glorious, is this unstained humanity, transfigured by tho artist's touch to an immortal form I It is not sacrilege to worship art, for it is the forerunner and symbol of God himself-the only thing buts quenchless human love, that we dare worship of this cold, half-frozen world. Then come with us to this "Leda and the Swan," by Croff   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         13 -Croff, remember that name, for the swans of immortality already are learning to sing it. Our swan-our God-Swan, with the downy. bosom, so soft and warm that it does not startle' the bosom still whiter, and softer, and warmer, of the dazzling young creature,' nestles lovingly in her lap. The long, graceful neck twines in her pleased arms,4 and clings like a stream of kisses between her unconscious breasts--glides along her neck, graceful as itself, and the head lifts, as with passion's own fingers, the hair that tendrils the white temples, and whispers in the unconscious ear the talismanic word that unveils the universe to her wondering soul. Look at the face, where this word, lighting the lamp of love within the bosom's alabaster shrine, spreads such a glow of amazed rapture and expectation as only the voice of a God could create. Let us pass round the "Austrian" department, where this statue is placed, (why? since it is of Milan,) and enter the solemn, darkened tent of Christ and &e Apostles." Were this gallery of Thorwaldsen's greatest worl to be opened to the public by itself, the whole world would run to see it. But here it is only one of the attractions. The visitors have not yet got up to the point of understanding and appre- eiating this great work, but it will do so. Daguerreotypes and lace pelerines will not hold them forever. Of course, we can go no farther in our mention of individual works of art, lest our look should turn out rather a criticism than a picture. But we cannot help mentioning the "Grisly Bear and the Hunter"- one of the most life-like and terribly powerful works we have seen. The immense and crushing strength of the bear, the feeble, final strug- gle of the hunter, whose head and left arm have fallen relaxed in death, while the remainder of the body still quivers with the last muscular action of life-are something that make you shudder with a sickening horror. And so, for the first time in America, we have an opportunity of seeing, studying, understanding, the sublime art of sculpture, in its tro- phies, won from the old homes of the sculptor's genius in Europe. By- and-by the picture gallery will give us the same chance to know what painting is. And the treasures of art, thus gathered from the different nations of Europe, are brought to our capital of the New World, as Napoleon' sent to his metropolis of the old-to embellish, to, enrich and to teach our eager and ambitious nation what we most desire to know. But, not like Napoleon the conqueror, have these spoils of art been gathered-not at the price of a decimated populace, whose bravest and most precious,blood has been poured out upon the battle-field-not at the price of a nation bankrupted, of empires and kingdoms dismembered, of governments overturned, and a whole world steeped in blood and horrors. A few private gentlemen, whose unobtrusive lives passed at the desk or the counting-house, had accumulated a few hundred thou- sand dollars-conceived the idea of doing by themselves for their coun- try what the governments of England and France had done or were doing for theirs, A few articles in our newspapers-a few letters sent to and fro by our international fleets of ocean steamers, English, French, German, and American-and behold the result I How will all the havoc and devastation that the "combined fleets" may work, or     "    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. may even now have wrought, within sight of the dome of St. Sophia, compare with this peaceful and beautiful sight, beneath the dome of our people's Crystal Palace-this beautiful temple of art and science? Let history answer to posterity this pregnant question. We have no time th-day to go further through the Palace-to mount these elegant stair-cases and penetrate the labyrinthine galleries, pro.- tected by the beautiful and graceful wire railing, as light and pretty as a lady's lace ruffle. We must take another day to examine the count- less and precious objects of art, and science, and manufactures, with which the Palace is filled. Indeed, many days might be agreeably and instructively spent here. But we can only give one more to the Pal- ace, and must then hasten to visit and explore the other quarters of the city.  ,                      .       i i        I                     "   CH APTER III. WALL STREET AND THE MERCHANTSO EXCHANGE. THE stock sales are over. The little group, consisting of some two score of the initiated, who understood the mysterious jargon going oa within the inner red-canopied sanctuary of the Exchange, and a few wondering outsiders, who knew no more of it than did the Epicurean of the mysteries of Isis, that daily takes its place around the chancel railings of this crimson-canopied altar of Mammon, have dispersed. The loud-mouthed auctioneer, selling most picturesque and romantically situated village lots, country residences, villas, mansions-in fact, cas- tellated palaces, surrounded by century old parks, stocked with deer, and pheasants-have all bawled themselves hoarse and gone to their r8   underground dens to count their honestly earned gains of the morning. The members of the " third board" are snooping about " the street," picking up items here and there of what has really been going on during the morning among the big bugs; who is " short," who is " lame,: who has been " cornered," and what is whispered about among the knowing ones as the programme for to-morrow. It is a quarter past two o'clock. There is an apparent lull in the street--but it is only apparent. The forty-five minutes between this time and three o'clock contrive to crowd themselves with more anxiety, solicitude, hope, fear, despair, and mental agony than was ever got together in any other three-quarters of an hour sine the last mo- ments,of the flood. From our look-out behind this titanic granite column, let us look abroad upon the street. The sun pours down his streams of red hot light upon the step and sidewalk. The Custom House gleams like an immense live coal at white heat, and, the banks that contain this deep- flowing current of Wall street, with {their sombre hues of dirty greys and hot, smouldering browns, throw back the sunshine with livid beams that suffocate the very air. Still, through this gasping atmosphere, hurry, with silent, shuffling step, throngs of men, old, young, well dresa- ed and untidy, fat, lean, tall, short-all different, yet all alike, with- that expression of uniform anxiety, which, to the knowing observer, is as unmistakable as the aspect of a counterfeit bill to a broker. Vp and down the steep steps of the banks, which at every few paces dip themselves in the current-in and out at softly-swinging green baize doors, thatturn as noiselessly as the gates over which is written in the vision of the immortal Italian, "Let those abandon hope who enter here"-plunging down into the innumerable caves that line the street and lie below the level of the walk: see them go. Would not a rational being, stationed here for the first time, and knowing nothing of the     16    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. great game of money-making which absorbs the faculties of the present age-would he not conclude that some gigantic lunatic asylum had been let loose, and that its inmates were rushing about in disgust with their newly-found freedom, trying to find their quiet and sombre cells again? But let them go-the rabble of the street: while *e turn our atten, - tion within, and see what is going on in this beautiful Rotunda, with its marble walls, and graceful Corinthian columns, upon which those compo- site capitals have not been placed. The in-comers here are, for the most part, evidently of the mercantile old fogy class. They pause to blow, at every three or four paces, as they hoist their heavy and unwieldy per. sons slowly and toilingly up the granite steps. The Shaving Cream man lifts his hat with involuntary respect, as they pass by. They are evidently themselves the shaving cream of our financial aristocracy. Heaven help those who are so unlucky as to be shaved by them!  Within the Rotunda you only see a crowd of commonplace people, winding in and out, grouping themselves together, pairing off, and talk- ing in a low voice in some corner, or against a pillar-and you hear a confused, perpetual murmur, like the swarming of bees, or the voice of the sea in a calm. The lofty panels of the dome catch and reverberate every sound, sending it- back with increased force, upon the ear, until the accumulation of these whisperings and low ttlkings, becomes thun- derous in your ear, and almost crazes you. If you listen to what is said, here, unless you are initiated, you will learn very little that will guide you in forming an opinion of what is going on. Half phrases, broken sentences, mysterious gestures and signs-these form the staple of what is doing here. If you have not the key, you might as well be an attendant upon the worship at a Chinese temple to Josh (not Silsbee), and chop sticks. Here, at this hour, daily congregate the real, bona fide, no-mistake magnates of our financial and commercial aristocracy. Having taken their two shilling dinner at Brown's, or their cut of pie and coffee (or perhaps eve something stronger), at the Verandah, they meet here to discuss the commercial news of the day-the prices of exchange, money and produce-and to play the great game of gambling, which leads to respectability and success, or to disaster, bankruptcy and ruin. "Treason is ne'er successful; what's the reason  When 'tis quocessful, 'tis no longer treason." Hudibras, nor any other satirist of human nature, ever wrote any- thing truer than that; and it applies with especial force to the Mer- chants' Exchange of New York. The hours devoted to the brokers and avowed speculators are a different affair. But at this particular hour of the day-this "High Change,"' as it is called par excellence-the millionaires and magnates of the city-those men whose slightest re- marks uttered on' 'Change are greedily recorded by the commercial reporters and trumpeted forth the next morning ad if the Delphian oracle had spoken, meet here, and in whispers, shrugs and inuendoes, decide prices, fortunes and destinies; which ramify through every rank of society, and effect, for good or evil, the whole movement and life of the community. It is they who get up or suppress panics-who cause money to be "light" or "easy"-and whose decisions, formed upon u *   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         1 their own personal and private gambling interests, settle the question whether the country is to be prosperous or unfortunate. Yonder, prowling about like a cat at midnight, among the tiles and chimneys, is a commercial reporter, the "money market man" of a daily paper. If ears were ever useful, his are so. Each one of these Somewhat:ungraceful auricular appendages, opened to its fullest extent, is drinking in the whispered, broken, ejaculatory conversations going on around him. With the electric apprehension only to be acquired by snch a life of experience as his, he gathers into the focus of his brain, all the different rays of intelligence, news and thought, floating about, in this gold-impregnated atmosphere. When he leaves the Ro- tnda, which will not be till the "l st cat is hung;" he will linger down the steps and along the walk in the vicinity, to catch some laggard millionaire by the button, and try toworm out of him the secretof some " transaetion in flour, or grain, or what not, that as not "trans- pired." Then off he rushes to the telegraph office, to put his Southern and Westrn correspondents' in possession of. the important secret that "20,000 barrels flour were;sold' to-day, at an advance of 6d on yester- days quotations-to be delivered next week." The same astounding, intelligene is repeated in the evening editions ef his own paper, andjn sundry correspondences which he keeps up with journals out of the city. These apparently insignificant facts are what regulate and con- trol the whole movement of society and aede'dethose other all-important questions, whether madame is to have a newn carriage and mademoiselle a new lover, who is only to be caught in a point-lace net stretched over a palpitating bosom (swelling with vanity, not love); or whether the old Brougham and the old Harry are to do until the next favorable turn in the market. The fatal hour of three is chiming from the spire of Trinity-that beautiful, pure and holy monument of art, rising like an exhalation from the fiery dust of the cityj ahd looking solemnly down upon the clamor and crowd of Wall street. The banks 'have already their shutters closed, though now and then some' belated customer steals out from the door and rushes wildly off with a bit of paper in his hand, which he savagely crushes up in his fingers; lest it Should escape his grasp and have to be taken up over again to-morrow. The street grows rapidly vague and silent-footsteps echo but rarely along the pavement-the omnibuses cease to stop at the head of the street to wait for passengers -the clock points to ten minutes after three, and Wall street has lock- ed up and gone home. What a time we have been lingering here I We have consumed almost the other three-quarters of an hour which we had wrenched from the business of the day, for our visit to Wall street. But we must not quit this important and interesting quarter 6f New York without some grave and profitable reflections. Who, then, are these favored and powerful individuals who exert this immense control over society and the world? What they were, we will say nothing 'about: as towho and what they are, go to Juilien's or Ole Bull's, or Sontag's, and you will see. They are the patrons of the Opera-the hope of Art in this couhtry and this age: and the beauty of it is, that they know as much of painting, of statuary, of architecture, and the 2     13$,    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. belles lettres, as of music. They are quite as familiar with Shakespeare and Milton, Shelley and Tennyson, Byron and Coleridge, as with Ros- sini and Meyerbeer. There is no conceivable subject of poetry, art or literature, upon which they will not pronounce a judgment with the authority of a critic and the prolixity of an amateur. They have that which is so much better than knowledge, or study, or experience, or brains, or in fact, than anything but money-they have position; and that position they have obtained and can only keep because of their money. No one cares to dispute with them their claims to fashion and  exclusiveness. No one dares to exhibit the ludicrous mockery of their pretensions to elegance and social eminence. No one dares lay bare the lie upon which they live, nor to hold them up for what they are. No one dares question them, as they stride insolently through the tem- ple of fashion and good, society, or march disdainfully and with flying colors to their velvet-cushioned pew in Grace Church.* While all know the truth, yet they pass unquestioned. Why is this? Because the great majority of their neighbors are as bad as themselves, and dare not for their lives agitate the question of an investigation into the title deeds of those who hold within their grasp the lordly domains of aristocracy and fashion. The few who might safely challenge these vulgar pre- tenders, shrink with instinctive disgust from the thankless task while of the great struggling, fighting, straining world below them, each hopes to receive, at some remote period, the favor of a smile of recog- nition from these misshapen images that the demon of snob democracy sets up in the niches of the beautiful and the great.'  Let us return from our long and interesting detour to Wall street and the purlieus of the Exchange. Let us watch the process by; which the fortunes are accumulated that enable their possessors thus to lord it over the world, and climb to these places of eminence and distinction which should be reserved alone to the wise, the brilliant and the good. We will not descend to the particulars of the various transactions which go to make up the sum of that profession known as trade. Suf- fice it to say, that the foundation of it all, the secret of success, the key to wealth and power, is the cautious over-reaching of the neighbor. So long as the merchant or the speculator maintains untarnished that conventional honor which thieves find it absolutely necessary to enforce in the division of their plunder; so long as his bank account is good and his credit untainted in "the street," no matter how savagely he may oppress the poor man within his power-no matter how many hearts he may have wrung with anguish, how many lips may turn white with hunger, how many desperate souls driven to crime, how many milk-white virgin bosoms be given to the polluting touch of lust, for money to buy bread-how many fellow beings may be wholly crushed and made forever desperate by the iron grasp of this' man, he is. still respectable, "one of the most respectable of our citizens." And should one of his beggared victims cross his path on his way to church, or entreat but a solitary penny to stave off the pangs of hunger, he would, assume the indignant air of a martyr, suffering under the persecutions of an insolent and Ungrateful world. The engines andinstruments by which this man works are numerous and charadteristic. Sometimes he forestalls the market of a certain   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         19 kind of produce, and then when his carefully concealed operations are completed, gradually expands the price in accordance with the increas- ing demand, until he thus gathers his thousands from the absolute neces-  sities of the community. Sometimes he organizes a company to kindly supply the people with money, or to dig coal, or copper, or zinc, or lead, from fabulous mines, drawn carefully out on paper maps, and situated in some inaccessible Sahara amid the wild regions of New Jersey. Then  he sells the stock out upon a fictitious valuation got up by incessant puffs in the leading commercial papers, and so makes a fortune, and the scheme explodes. Sometimes he discovers that the interests and honor of the nation require a railroad from Frogtown to Tadpolopolis, and a similar operation lines his pockets at the cost of a few hundred green victims; or perhaps the commercial prosperity of the Empire State demands that a line of steamships should be established to break down all opposition, and prove that some things can be done as well as others. Straightway the newspaper pumps are put in operation, and books of subscription opened, and flaming appeals made to the patriotism of Congress for a small appropriation of a million or two, just by way of experiment, and to sustain the honor of the country. Of course the stock is subscribed and paid for by the victims, while the appropriation goes into the pockets of the shrewd capitalist, and he becomes more magnificent, more haughty and insolent than ever. Arrived at the sta- tion of the millionaire, whether in fact or in renown, it makes no differ- ence, he has forgotten himself and all the incidents that might embar- rass or humiliate him in his present position. Trace him back but a single generation, and we may find his paternal ancestor cobbling boots or hammering at a barrel; while on the maternal side, the shop-board and the goose loom in the distance, and a well-worn thimble would be the only proper seal and device for the family coat of arms. Such is a fair and not overdrawn picture of a type of the money, shop-keeping aristocracy of the New World-a race of beings who, as a natural historian, we undertake to say, have never been equaled on the face of this earth, in all that is pompous without dignity, gaudy without magnificence, lavish'without taste, and aristocratic without good manners ,!  'a     CHAPTER IV. BROADWAY IN ITS SUMMER OLOTHES., FROM Wall street, let us take a stroll up Broadway. Look up at the Trinity Church clock, and see what time it is. WhatI It is stopped again ---suspended business, eh?-and is fairly to be enrolled in the catagory of lame ducks I It has for some weeks been going on time, but the tick now seems to be exhausted, and all hands are brought to a regular stand-still. No doubt the old clock, from its proximity to Wall street, has felt the contagion of the terrible excitement among the' bulls and bears going on there, and has been dipping into some of the desperate speculations as thick as blackberries in those digging.! The fact is, we suspect the old fellow has been awfully bitten, and hasn't a "quarter" left, and that all his " insides" are in such a state of exhaus- tion and derangement that it is doubtful whether he will ever again make good time if he runs. Tie defalcation of this elevated public functionary is at this moment particularly unfortunate, as the-rush-of business down town is so tremendous that people don't have time to pull out their watches, and can only now and then take a hasty glance at the spire of Trinity, which stands like a' grim-sentinel over this-laby- rinthian cave-just to see how near three o'clock it is. We-hear that, solely on account of the dissipation of this clock, and its not keeping regular hours, several supposed-to-be wealthy individuals have forgot- ten to pay their notes during the last week, and are now in a state of, suspended animation, similar to that of the clock itself. Well, never mind-it is not yet four o'clock. Let us up Broadway, leisurely, and see what is going on. Although it is September, yet the summer is still here, with its thousands of summer visitors, while our own citizens remain tenaciously out of town, clinging to the fading dissipations of Saratoga and New- port, or quietly and sensibly enjoying the delights of hundreds of shady and romantic retreats within easy railroad reach of Wall street and the City Hall. Meanwhile the city, though deprived of those who fondly think they are the salt and spice that save it from spoiling, is quite as busy, as noisy, as gay, and as exciting, as when Operadom, with its feathers and flummery, is in full state. In fact, we think New York never enjoys herself quite so heartily as in August and September, when the citizens of the west and south meet here for their annual dip and polish in the magic sea of metropolitan life. The splendid mansons of the Fifth avenue and the West End are hermetically closed, and it gives one a cold shudder to go by them ; they seem like a sort of PalmyFa in the desert, abandoned by its imperial and dissipated revellers. Meanwhile,   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW     YORK.     21 the social movement concentrates about the hotels, where dinners, re- ceptions, soir6es, and hops, rule and embellish the hour. This phase of life in New York is not without certain distinctive and characteristic points of-interest. 'At the theatre and concerts, at the Chrystal Palace, the afternoon promenade, the drive in Broadway- you encounter a style of dress and manner as un-New-Yorkish as pos- sible. Elderly gentlemen, in remarkably-cut black coat and trowsers, with black satin waistcoats and antiquated chokes, scramble into wrong omnibusses, attended by two or three ladies attired like duchesses in masquerade-and, after long and earnest conversations among them- selves, and angry colloquies with the driver, (of course to the intense disgust of all the other passengers in a hurry,) scramble out again with- out paying, and with a knowing air, as much as to say, "you New York chaps can't cheat us-we're sharp enough for you!"At the concert or the theatre, those extraordinary woolen tidies and chair aprons, which must make a lady's head feel, in this hot weather, asif it were wrapped up in a flannel petticoat, generally take the place of the light and graceful head-dress appropriate to the season. Glass brooches and bracelets, with ear-rings to match, and which, if real, would cost the income of the President, glitter amid the many-colored ribbons and 1   * showy cotton laces with which the- wives and daughters of the sove- reigns from the country adorn their dashing figures. Voices are louder and laughs more frequent than usual. The steady-going New Yorker, looking up from his reverie or pausing in his grand rush about town, wonders into what strange place he has been spirited. But he looks up and sees the City Hall clock pointing ominously to half past two- and, suddenly remembering that he has a note to pay, he rushes off like mad, and speedily forgets'his " stunning" friends from the country. But, at all events, this is the season when everybody enjoys himself; and New-York never within our remembrance, (although we are not the oldest inhabitant, yet we are distantly related to the family,) has been-so lively, so brilliant, and so gay, as at present. Here we are at Taylor's new and gorgeous ice-cream palace-shall we enter? 'Many people imagine that these splendid establishments are nothing less than female grog-shops and 'assignation houses. It is true that wines and liquors of all kinds are sold at these places, and that no persons are excluded from them, provided they conduct themselves quietly'andtwith decorum. We do not see how-the proprietors could exact more than this, nor why the same censure does not apply to Stewart's and Beck's, to the picture galleries, and, in fact, the churches -for, so long as a woman conducts herself properly, she has a perfect right to enter whatever public place she pleases. We have very fre- quently seen our fashionable femmes de plaisir issuing from their fine car- riages, side by side with the liveried equipages from the West Endr and mingling with the fashionable throng that ebbs and flows daily at the fancy shops. We ourselves have seen, more than once, the mistress of one of the proprietors of a fashionable dry goods establishment trading and chatting with her paramour across the counter, while his own wife stood at the counter directly opposite, gnawing her pale lips and clench- ing her hands in jealous agony. Such things are comiron enough every where. Probably the ice-cream saloons witness their full share of these i      22     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. transactions; but it is out of the way for the proprietors to interfere and as to the general tone and appearance of respectability in these establishments, there is certainly nothing to complain of. As to ladies drinking, the general opinion is greatly exaggerated. Ladies occasionally take a glass 'of wine, a sherry cobbler, there, as they would do at home. But the instincts of women are all against intoxication, and we do not believe that such a thing as a drunken w'oman ever was seen at Taylor's or Thompson's. The only women who drink to excess are of the lowest and most depraved class of public characters--and they are so well marked by their personal appearance, dress, and' manners, that they would never think of such a thing as entering one of these places. We know well that female dissipation and thoughtlessness are com- mon enough, in all ranks of society-and that the married women and young girls of America, from their almost total lack of occupation, of wholesome mental excitement, and the absolute freedom, from restric- tions of their daily life, are powerfully incited to indulge in caprices and transgressions, which, at first innocent or merely mischievous, gradually lead to every consequence. Among the rich, the passion of women, pampered by high living and greatly neglected by their husbands and natural protectors, prepetually lead them to risk every thing to procure the homage of men. With the classes below, the universal temptation is the love of finery and the vain emulation inherent in womam's nature. Going still lower down, there are many who are driven to sell themselves even for bread-though the great majority of working girls resort to the infamous traffic of their persons merely for the enjoyment of a little social pleasure, denied them by their position, and for the sake of pro- curing finer dresses than they can purchase with their honest earnings. We have for years past investigated, thought and written much on this subject, and endeavored to view it in a strictly practical light. The conclusions to which we have arrived are, that women generally have no inclination to indulge their passions except with the man they love- but that, in too many cases, their reluctance is overcome by the stronger passions of vanity and love of pleasure. The open and universal infi- delity of men teaches women to suspect that the sanctity attached to female chastity is a humbug, imposed upon them as a bug-bear, and that what men do every day with impunity, they may do without any terrible harnf coming of it. Therefore, many young women, unprotected by the influence of a genuine love, which is ever a safeguard, yield up their virtue in a moment of discontent and desperation, and to purchase the gratification of that personal vanity and that intense love of pleasure which are the bases of so many female characters. This is a subject of so much delicacy and difficulty, that no real pro- gress has ever been made in it. Education and refinement appear rather to develop than retard the dangerous faculties of woman-and even religion too often becomes merely a cloak, in which the joyous, elastic, exuberant, pleasure-loving creature, woman, more securely carries on her merry masquerade. If the woman's rights conventions would turn their serious attention to this question, they might do a great deal of good, and redeem themselves from ridicule and contempt which thus far their movements have created.    .    ,   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK,         23 The gigantic establishment where we are, is but an exhalation from the hollowness, hypocrisy, and insincerity, of the times. We live on the sidewalks; we dine, dress, talk, and make society, in public.; we marry for money and live for appearance; our shops have all their goods in the street window ; women's forms are made of cotton, and the ideas that should enrich their brains, are developed in flaunting finery upon their bonnets. Even our splendid hotels and public houses are veneered with marble and stuffed in with old brick-bats-their magnificence is only skin-deep. The parlors are palatial, while the bed-rooms would disgrace a country tavern. Our steamboat builders spend a hundred thousand dollars in useless flummery and gaudy upholstery, and save two dollars a month by employing an ignoramus or a drunkard for engineer, who blows the whole concern to the devil, on the first fair opportunity. Our newspapers cut each other's throats, and spend thousands upon thousands, in printing the largest sheets, and getting the earliest intelli- gence by telegraph, of events which would be deemed utterly insignifi- cant transpiring under their noses-and even our churches exhaust the purses of their congregations in building spacious edifices and furnishing them extravagantly, while hundreds of miserable, ignorant, God-and-, man-forsaken wretches swelter in vice and filth, and starve and rot, around their very walls. Ostenstation and heartlessness are the vices of the day-and their worst feature is, that while they make so many wretched, they do not confer either dignity or happiness upon even their owners. A little taste, a little aspiration for refinement, a little heart, and a little genuine human nature, would be a million times better than this universal human crystal palace into which the world is arranging itself. ^ i . .i:..            CHAPTER V. PICTURE OF A LIVE NEW YORK EDITOR. OF COURSE, you must wish to know all about the press of New-York. The press I Mighty power I Miraculous engine I Irresistible impulse, that keeps the world's pulse throbbing,-electric thrill, that clarifies the moral atmosphere, and keeps this age of common-place from putrefac- tion and decay I What shall we say of thee? Perplexed between our veneration for -the press in the abstract, and our knowledge of the actual, we fear on the one hand to do it more than honor, and on the other less than justice. What the tripod of the Pythoness, the omens and oracles of the seers and soothsayers, the inspirations of the prophets, and the direct revelations from heaven, were to the eaclier ages-what the two tables of stone, given to Moses on Mount Horeb, were to the patri- archal epoch of the race-the press ought to be to the present generation; what chivalry and knighthood were to the dark ages, the knights of the press should be to this: the defender of the assailed, the protector ef the weak, the vindicator of the innocent-the terror of the oppressor, the scourge of the falfe, and the standard of all courtesy and honorable dealing. No institution or power on earth, sacred or secular, ever held so high a trust, or ministered from so lofty an altar, as the free press of the nineteenth century. And yet, sometimes, when looking partially or hastily at the subject, and seeing of what materials some of the elements of this powerful institution is composed, one is almost tempted to de- nounce it as the giant imposition of the age, the false priest and the dis- honest monitor, that should be chased in disgrace from beyond the temple. But let us stop moralizing and take an example. The argumentum ad hominem is the only effective appeal, now-a-days. Let us, therefore, illustrate the character of at least a portion-and no inconsiderable por- tion, either, of the daily press of New York-by a living example or two. And, as they say in the comedies at Burton's, here comes one who will admirably answer our purpose. He is the responsible editor of a wealthy daily paper. Let us take a view of the man as he comes towards us.' He is tall, full six feet in height, walks with a sort of stiff, hobbling gait, with his cane somewhat raised, as if he wished to be ready for an attack, if, perchance one should be made upon him; though, if rumor speaks the truth, when these assailants did find it con- venient to apply a slight foot friction to his seat of honor, he did not show that lion-like courage that might be expected from his size and tI   apparent strength; but rather the disposition that might be supposed  a   to characterize the ass in the lion's skin. In justice, however, to him, Xi jwe must say that he never lets the consideration of personal chas-   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.       -2 tisement, influence him enough to cause him to refrain from saying whatever he, thinks fit (no matter how scurrilous that may be), of those who may have incurred his enmity. His hair is grey and long, and he sports also grey whiskers, goatee and imperial, which, together with a slight obliquity of vision, and general expression of countenance, not the most amiable in the world, gives him in the tout elsenble rather an Ishmaelitish appearance. Whatever may be thought of the man, he is well known, and his influence is great, through his paper, in this country, and even in Europe it is read with great interest, as it is supposed to be a sort of exponent of the popular feeling of the people here, which the wisest of their statesmen, and even crowned heads, often dread, and look for with -fear and trembling. The enterprise and tact of the man in acquiring such a position must be admired, though we cannot extol the means which he made use df to attain his ends. Starting with but little capital, at a time when the great six-penny sheets, with plenty of money and a great flourish of trumpets, were supposed to monopolize all the talent and intelligence of the country, he had to strike out a new path, and he did it with consummate knowledge of, at least, the worst part of human nature. He made his paper piquant and witty, got up good and -humorous police reports, put in a little scandal, a crim con case now and then, some double-entendres, and it is said also did not hesitate to modestly hint in to-day's paper, and promise further developments in the next,6f some innocent peccadilloes of certain long considered very pious and conscientious church members, which, singularly enough, did not appear according to promise. After a while, as the paper prospered, these singularities in a measure disappeared, and it assumed its present position of one of the most influ- ential papers on this continent, though every now and then the old tricks will stick out, and some singular and mysterious advertisement appear, to wit: " that if a certain young lady, who rode up last evening in a 8d Avenue omnibus, dressed in black, with a green veil, and who, in pass- ing up her sixpence, unconsciously squeezed the right finger of a young gentleman with a swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, will address through the Post Office, Amens, she will hear of something greatly to her advantage;" and also now and then an advertisement for board for a very quiet and interesting young lady in a family, (that of a widow preferred), where no other boarders are taken; board paid in advance instead of reference. Barring these little peculiarities, every thing is now conducted in a highly conservative style, and would do credit to a Wall street journal of the fogy order; but it is only fair to state that while it has earned for itself an unenviable notoriety by admitting to its columns such morwezx as those of which we have given specimens, it has also achieved a world-wide celebrity for the enterprise and energy it has long displayed in furnishing its readers with early information on all matters of interest from the most remote quarters of the globe. The daily press of Now York is one of the most remarkable features of the times. The "penny press," commencing at the bottom, has reached the very topmost round of journalism, as understood in this country: while the old-fashioned "respectable sixpennies" are getting     26     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. farther and farther out of sight and mind. In regard to everything appertaining to enterprize and news, the two-cent papers of New York, of the present day, are ahead of anything else in the world. But we are forced to confess that, when we compare them with the leading jour- nals, of Europe in point of talent, dignity and style, they are greatly wanting. Indeed, the publishers and owners of these papers seem to think that an enormous amount of flimsy paper, closely covered with small type, and sold for an incredibly' low price, is all that is necessary to constitute a great newspaper: while the intellectual part of the business is treated with very little consideration, and suffered to get along as best it can. This cannot always be the case. The time must soon come when the very competition we now witness, in the mere mechanical departments of newspaper publishing, will have exhausted that field of excellence, and journals, in the rivalry of stretching their columns and adding to their expeinses, will be in danger of falling victims to the very competition they have themselves established. Theh, other elements of popularity will be sought after, and journals will begin to: be estimated as well on account of their eloquence, their candor, their knowledge, anid the disinterested expression of enlightened views, as for the length of their columns and the number of their pages. At present, save as organs for the advocacy and dissemination of cer- tain peculiar views, or as mere vehicles of publicity, the daily journals cannot be said -to exert any very wide or definite influence upon public opinion, or to hold any well-defined and fixed position. All know or think they know, the absolute venality of even the choicest and most reserved of the daily editorial columns-and the morning newspaper reader, after he has run his eye over the telegraph reports and the ad- vertisements, lays it aside and never refers to it again. If the real truth must be told, there is more original writing, and of a higher quality, in the regular Sunday morning journals, than in all the rest of the week. Now and then, something startling is brought forward in the editorial columns of a daily journal-but, for the most part, their leaded lucubrations are so notoriously stale, flat and unprofitable, that the reader gives up all expectation of being interested, and lays them aside in silence.  .'.   ;   , y                                      ,                               .  .-*^   ^ '. '   CHAPTER VI. A GENERAL DASH AT THE FERRIES. HURRA! There goes the bell I Give us the change-run-jump-dash -here we are! Thanks to a quick eye, a pair of tolerably long, if not handsome legs, and considerable practice in the sharp work of getting about and around New York. A greenhorn, or a Philadelphia, or anybody from those provincial places, would have now been paddling about in that involuntary salt water swimming-bath shut in by the slip. Imagine, for a moment, our venerable and respected cotemporary (that's the respectable word for neighbor, we believe,) of the City Item, in such a sctape. He would never say another word against New York- never! But the fact is, we needn't have been in so terrible a hurry. We could very profitably have spent five minutes of our sacred fifteen, in the passengers' room. Suppose we step ashore, and wait for the next dA   boat? The first person who enters the room, after ourselves, is a lady. She is dressed in one of those chocolate-colored, unrevealing, linen-and-cotton out-door night-gowns, which the Genius of Ugliness has just invented, and is chuckling over .as one of his most successful achievements. A shirred barege bonnet of a similar hue, with a thick green veil-that national symbol of propriety and virtue in this country-carefully con- ceals her features. Still, as she walks, the voluptuous undulations of the form, so seductively painted by Baliac, in his Madame Marneffe, -I!   disclose the young woman, full of life and animal spirits. Pretty, too, she doubtless is. But why that " envious veil?" as somebody calls it. There is no sun, and the. day is stewingly warm-regular fricasee weather. She must be nearly suffocated under that thick face-counter- pane. "Madame, we really must beg to suggest that --X "What would you suggest to that lady, sir?" "That--ehem 1-it is a remarkably fine day, sir. What Harry, my boy-is it you? Why, where the mischief are you bound?" "Sh-!"

She also composes a waltz or a polka rJ *j-     28  '   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. now and then, and writes tolerable articles for a s0i-disant American musical journal. She gets up at six o'clock in the morning, and spends ten hours every day in giving lessons at the houses of her-patients, we had almost said. What an unheard-of amount of stupidity she must encounter in the course of the year I What scores of "interesting young ladies" who don't know the difference between A flat and a dia- pason, and whose fingers are incapable of learning the distance from tonic to sub-dominant--to whom 3-4 time possesses no marked difference from 6-8, and who never could see the use of those tiresome fats and sharps I And yet our musical old maid has managed to preserve her temper and her complexion. What a wife she would have made I  Mose and Lize, with a party of very particular friends,' have just burst through the toll-house, very much like, as we may imagine, the CVoths entered Rome. They--our Bowery friends, and not- the Goths are laughing and shouting with fun. Mose carries his coat on one arm and a hnge basket in the other hand, at which he now and then glanhes in a most expressive manner. The thing is clear-a pic-nic is orming off-and there'll be "hirh" doings before that party ets home. Here is a nervous old gentleman, who is always afraid of being too late, and looks into the room,timidly, as much as to ask, humbly, whether anybody has any objection to his going over in the next boat. He advertised yesterday morning in the Herald for a wife-and, fearful that somebody would be sure to recognise him in New York, made ther rendezvous in Greenwood Cemetery. If he knew that the fair one whom he expects to meet, and who has written to him in such tender terms, is a  pocket-book dropper, a "burner," a "watch-stufer"--in short, a genteel swindler, who has laid himself out for a big haul, our nervous and timid friend would take the first stage-up town, and remain in bed andon a diet of herb-tea for a fortnight. The probabilities, even, are that he would'marry his landlady. Closely following the nervous man, is a lady whom you at once re- cognise for an Englishwoman. She is not in the least handsome, but. there is a solidity and reality about her, a sincerity of purpose and character, an absence of that shop-window-iveness of now-a-days,--a  real, substantial, business-like ailr, which announces unmistakeably the English wife and mother. We know her well. She is the wife of an Engrlish offe sent ove to this country to makLe some observations upon steam marine. They stop, of course, at the Clarendon; but the five children and the governess could not be permitted to stay in a hotel: it was altogether too much opposed to Englishaideas. Theylare established in Brooklyn, and the mother goes every day, and, mind you, 2vallJ, although it is so easy to ride, walks from the Clarendon to the South Ferry, and from the foot of Atlantic street, a mile and a half, to her children's temporary home. - Her American friends at the hotel--- thiwchested, crinolined and dyspeptic, done up in orange-colored organ- dies and Virginia-fence lace collars that don't go below the hem of the dress, are astonished at her temerity in taking those daily walks, and "'woutldn't do it for the world." In fact, they consider it quite'vulgar; and can't at all see the necessity of walking when' there are so many omnibuses I  Our Englishwoman, however, is sound and healthy-colored --enjoys the exercise--has strong and hearty children, and, in her   FIFTEEN MNUTIS ,AROUND NEW YBORK.        ,29 green-striped de laine dress and brown bonnet, is one of the most con- tented reatures in, existence. But the boat is in-we must be off. Stop! Let us wait for that graceful and msjestic woman, who walks down was deliberately as if she were. Cleopatra, and the "Passaic", were her pleasure-bark, so magnificently upholstered by Shakespeare. She is veitld, but in that, bewitching, fascinating, odalhsquisi sort of way so seldom achieved by an anglo-Saxon, on either side of the water. Who is she?   Lend us your ear: That is THE LADY IN BLACK. Her history and adventures were well known, some years ago, and she was for the usual period the object of one of those unaccountable moral spasms known as a "New York excitement." She was, among other trifles, accused of. murdering her husband, and stood her trial unblenchingly. She was acquitted, and soon after sunk from public attention. She now lives a retired, if not a virtuous life, and may be frequently seen going home or coming into the city, spreading her lures for any old victim with a sugary tooth, who may happen to encounter her on the ferry boat. If that heart could write its experience, its thoughts, its sensations, what a record it would be I What a veil would be lifted from the mystery of the life of woman I And now, we should like to know why it is that people will not and cannot wait quietly until the passengers who have just come over, have time to get off, and out of the way? Everybody knows that the boat won't go until the passengers are aboard-that it is safely chained up to the wharf, and that the bell will ring in season to give them plenty of time. Still, as soon as the boat appears in sight, the waiting crowd collects on the verge of the wharf, waiting its arrival with intense anxiety; and the instant it touches, a general rush and scramble takes place to get on bqard-of course, embarrassing, delaying, corn-smash- ing, and generally upsetting the comers ashore. The consequence is, that what might be so easily, naturally and conveniently achieved, is transformed into a regular battle between two opposing hosts, armed with umbrellas, baskets, bundles, and babies. The loss on both sides is of course tremendous ; and the whole business of crossing a ferry is thus voluntarily rendered one of the most atrocious " little miseries" to which metropolitan human nature is liable. At last we are on board again. A large fat woman, who jumped at the last moment, basket and all, has fallen short and gone dowLn How- ever, she considerately threw the basket on board, and its beets, sau- sages, and doughnuts are scattered all about. No doubt they will be collected, with the rest of the " remains," by the deck hands, and sent home; so that Mr. Theophilus Squiggins, of Myrtle avenue, although he may have a cold wife, will have a warm dinner. True, we are not exactly a lady--although we were very near one last evening at the opera--but still we shall take the liberty of going into the "ladies' cabin," where, stuck up in that Fourieristic arm-chair extending all round the cabin, are quite as many trowsers as petticoats. The "gentlemen's cabin" is only occupied by negroes, blackguards and smokers--a practical definition of the word gentleman, for which we beg leave to say we are in no way responsible. : r      30     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. Well-over we go, gliding swiftly as a dream, and gulping down great mouthfuls of fresh sea air, enough to supply the city deficit of oxygeni for the remainder of the day. The lovely panorama of the river and bay passes before us-we squeeze ourselves in among the posts and pier-heads of the shore-the bell rings-the usual desperate fight to "effect a landing" takes place-and our fifteen minutes, as well as our- selves, are- "over."   CHAPTER VII. THE CITY HOSPITAL IN THE MONTH OP AUGUST. ISNT it refreshing to crawl out of your suffocating sick chamber, where you have been for four days maintaining a feeble fight against the cholera, the heat, a doctor, and five hundred other leeches in the shape of mqsquitoes-to ride quietly out and catch this Friday morn- ing's breeze, the first breath drawn by the present week-and to sit by this cool window, looking out over the green lawn and through the whispering trees, upon the perspiring and toiling street? Truly, the sick and wounded are provided with a hotel which, in point of location, far surpasses any of the " magnificent" establishments, with their bal- conies over the sidewalk and their windows filled with dust, about which they make such a noise. 'But we didn't come here to be comfortable-that is not an editor's perquisite; our business is to look aftir the miseries and sufferings of others. Let us go into the wards. How clean and fresh they are. We fear the " wards" (for the bed-rooms are no bigger) of our fashion- able hotels aforesaid; could not show such clean, white sheets-do not smell so pure and wholesome; and yet 'these are occupied by the sick, and wounded, and dying-by all that is generally considered tainting to the atmosphere and disgusting to the sense. Nothing but the most untiring care, the most admirable discipline, the most conscientious dis- charge of duty, could produce such a state of things. The honesty of at least this "public institution" is patent. It requires no certificate or endorsement. It does its own white-washing. But, notwithstanding, you cannot look down'this long row of suffer- ers without a shudder, a pang of unsatisfied philanthropy, a sickening sensation, that there must be ever such an enormous amount of human suffering, with no power to absolutely; relieve it. The actual presence of material evil calms and subdues the sorrowing of the spirit. Before, these broken limbs, scorching with the intense fever of slow re-knitting -these convulsed breasts, gasping and gurgling for breath-these wan cheeks and bright eyes watching in the air the certain approach of the grim spectre whomfthey know is coming to wrap them in his arms-the. soul is ashamed to remember her own temporary sufferings, and smiles in sad commiseration upon all she sees and hears. The first five patients in the'row upon which we have been gazing, seem strangely alike; they must be all suffering from the same disease. They are Irishmen. Their faces are livid, and a slight line of white froth is visible about their mouths. They have evidently been foaming at the mouth, but have been gradually soothed. They breathe with-     32     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. heavy, irregular snoring, and you think, every now and then, that the next breath will never come up some poor fellow's throat, it waits so long. At last it gurgles slowly up, and issues with a sport; gasping, the man turns partly over, and makes a convulsive movement with his hands and legs. A young doctor stands quietly looking on, watching carefully every movement, every breath.  "Poor fellow 1" says he, almost with a sigh, (he is young and not yet hardened) "he is nearly gone. If you had witnessed the scene that passed this morning between him and his wife and child, you would not wish to return here." "Did he know them? "No ; he has been unconscious ever since he was brought in, yester- day afternoon."t "What' id the'matter with him--witih ae-these?  "What! do you not know?

He was very pale and calm, but his thin blue-lips, and a set frown on his brow, showed that he must suffer intensely. Childhood sometimes gives evi- dence of the truest courage and heroism. Our little sufferer had been run over by an omnibus in the Fourth avenue, and his thigh broken. "He was brought here before he was sufficiently recovered to tell his name and residence. His father and mother were sent for, as soon as he regained his senses, and they have decided' to let him remain where he is, as it would be extremely dangerous to remove him. We have, as you s8t, not even removed him to a private ward, though his family would gladly pay for any extra attentions or accommiodations.'   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         33 "Would he be better tended there "No: the only advantage is that he would be by himself. I can conscientiously say that, in respect to treatment, attendance, and nurs- ing, the poor fare as well as the rich." "And do the rich ever come here-?" "Oh, yes-very often; and wisely, too. A young man, or a stran- ger, who meets with an accident, can be treated much more comfort- ably and successfully here, than in any hotel or boarding-house, even the best. This is now generally known, and considerably practised upon." The little sufferer here opened his eyes, and said, faintly, "Doctor, do you think I could turn over, just a little?--it hurts so bad!" "My child, you must suffer patiently. Every movement you make renders you liable to be crooked, when you get -well, You wouldn't like that, would you, my little man?" "Mama wouldn't like it, sir," said he, with a suppressed groan, as he closed his eyes, and again resigned himself to motionless suffering. The next bed contained nothing that could be recognised as belong- ing to humanity. It was a mangled mass of crushed and bleeding flesh and bones, bound together with sticks, and plasters, and bandages. The face is no longer a face. One of the eyes is torn out, and hangs by a shred of flesh.' It has been partially replaced, but does not at all fit the ghastly orifice. An awful blow has crushed in the back of the head, and the thick blood is still oozing from beneath the bandage. The lower jaw is broken short off, and hangs down upon the chest, exposing the mouth and tongue, horribly distorted. The chest and trunk are literally smashed to a jelly. A sort ofr choking, bubbling sound comes up through this frightful mass, showing that life still strug- gles beneath the horrid heap. But it will soon go out. . "Poor fellowl' says thedoctor, "it would have been a mercy toput a knife in his heart. The dressing of :his wounds only added a keen and useless torture. The Indians ;understand humanity better than we,. after all" This man had not been more than an hour in the hospital. He had- fallen from the top of a building in Nassau street,.near Clinton Hall, and in his descent struck his head'against an iron awning post and railing, breaking them down, anid crashing, head foremost upon. the ground. :He was carried away on a litter,learing a track of blood all along the street, which was followed by the curious crowd, as a pack of'hounds would have followed the trail of a stricken deer.. Butt we have lingered here, quite long enough. The sickening/and insidious odors of the place, which were at first concealed from the sense by .the exquisite cleanliness and purification of the establishment, have at length penetrated to our inmost sense, and we begin to feel afainting sensation. We meant to have gone through some of the wards devoted, to theipractical clinique, and seen the knife glancing: among;the arteries and vital tissues, and heard the saw giating its sharp,: jaggedteeth; across the live bones.

THE BROADWAY ZEM-ZEM.             , READER, have you ever noticed the "watering trough' at which the omnibus horses always stop, on their way up and down town, to "take a drink." To us, this half-way equestrian coffee-house is a point of no little interest-a resting-place between up and down town-a sort of metropolitan zem-zem in the desert of brick and mortar, at which the omnibus horse, that patient and greatly-abused camel of civili- zation, stops periodically to " wood and water." Every day, for months past, we have stopped, morning and evening, at this spot, and have gradually become absorbed'in a study of its peculiarities. The horses know this spot much better than we. They have scarcely dragged the heavy stage out of the rail-track in Sixth avenue, and turned'up Amity street towards Broadway, before they seem to sniff the fresh smell of the sparkling Croton, bubbling perennially up from the bottom of an especially green and quisby-looking trough, presided over by a boy with a bucket, a blue cotton shirt, cloth cap, and grey satinet trowsers, particularly satinetted at the seams and seat.- He has a snub nose, a defiant eye, and chews tobacco like a Missourian. He- appears to be about sixteen, but has already acquired the easy swagger and sublimely-unconscious impudence of the full-grown b hoy. He doesn't handle his bucket as if he were exactly ashamed of it-; but he looks up at the driver, and splashes the water into the noses of the horses, with .an air as much as to say, "I won't even take the trouble to be ashamed I'll work my way into a position of independent loafer- ism soon enough 1"           .  One thing we must say for the poor horses at the watering-trough-- they never get enough I If, like little Oliver, they had been endowed with speech and a basin, they would undoubtedly ask for'",more,"-we are sure of it.. As it is, they snuffle, and whinnow, and bite the rim of the bucket, and rub their honest noses coaxingly against "Jerry's' shoulder, and dance the hornpipe of expectation, after the' first'brief sip. But it is no use-Jerry is incorrigible; each gets his due quarter of a bucketful, and, like Joe the crossing-sweeperi they must irrevoca- bly "move on" . ,The way the different sorts of passengers take this regular stoppage . is curious. In the morning, the old fogy, on his way to the down-town counting house, don't see the necessity of keeping people waiting-peo- ple nightwater their horses before they started. The young lady in black barege and cotton stuffing, hurrying to Taylor's to keep an ap- pointment for which she is already too late-ladies make it a point always to be too late-fidgets on her seat, jumps up and immediately   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         35 sits down again-gets red with a sort of stage fright, to which young ladies invariably fall victims upon making the slightest exertion. Then she fumbles in her porte-mrnnaie, and after a long and anxious search, she fishes up, from the inner, rose-lined, most secret compartment, that horror of all omnibus-drivers and passengers in a hurry-a five dollf bill ' Good heavens I  this, then, the veritable personage of whom we have heard so much-the Lady with the Five Dollar Bill 1 Give us our umbrella-somebody's umbrella-any body's umbrella-and let  us go. The elements themselves are not so unkind as-this sort of i thing, as Shakspeare observes. Now, our young lady, having steadied herself by all the knees on either side of' the stage, is thrown by a sudden jolt-did an omnibus horse ever stand still till you were fairly out?-into the lap of old fogy, who gives a tremendous grunt-half rage and half satisfaction-while the lady picks up herself and her parasol, and, grasping convulsively whatever change the driver has chosen to reach down to her, makes a dart' out of the stage. The fringe of her mantilla, of course, catches on. a gentleman's coat-button, and while trying nervously to disengage it, both gentleman and lady blushing at the earnestness of their mutual efforts; her foot gets smashed by the door, which the driver had just pulled to. She screams, the gentleman with the button d--s its eyes, and: cuts the fringe-old fogy anathematises the whole omnibus system, and the rest of the passengers indulge in that quiet, intensely sarcastic omnibus smile, known and understood only by thorough cits. At last everything is free, and the young lady is landed in the middle of a-magnificent mud-puddle. No matter-we are fairfy rid of her.. No 1 she has forgotten her pocket-handkerchief I. Here comes the up-town stage-and there is a regular 'accumulation of drays, carts and carriages, all waiting their turn at the watering- trough-the horses vainly endeavoring to free themselves from the flies with incredible stampings and tail-whiskings, and the drivers sitting quietly and looking contentedly on, as if they relished the joke amaz- ingly, and didn't care how long it lasted. Up and down the sidewalk are running a couple of lovely little girls I Their bright, rosy faces, and their neatly-combed, extra-auburn hair, (surmounting vulgar countenances it would be red,) upon which the sunlight seems to love to linger, making a sort of halo round them, such as the old painters put round the heads of their Christs and Saints, win your heart at a glance. We have watched for them, morning and night, all summer long; and when we missthem from their accustomed seat on the one-step of the little portico, we feel quite sad and forgot- ten. They have got also to know us a little, from our now and then throwing them a handful of bon-bons, which the eldest always catches in her apron-holding it out in her pretty hands with such a modest, beautiful attitude, and with such a sweet smile of thanks on her face 1 And then, the inimitable grade with which the motherly little creature pours them into her sister's lap, and can hardly be prevailed on to even touch a single one for herself I Is anything on earth so beautiful as the protecting love of a little girl for her younger sister?

And then, when the little package, in it gold andS whiterpaper, appears, she comes as near to the curb-stone as she dares, while "little siss" holds, her back by the frock, and receives ourgift with such a gesture of infantile gladness and such a look of unconscious gratitude, as fills our heart with happiness.

Well, there- dertainly is another palace-the Palace of Mirrors, it. is called by its proprietress. If you have never received a gilt-edgei, perfumed, and highly embossed note, settitg forth its meritsi aid attic-' tions, it is because your name did: not appe&arin the "list of arrivalbi in the Express, "fourth edishing." n Tat list is carefully 'countL 9r by the inhabitants of the Palace of Mirrors,  and other subboriW'te establishments, as by the drummers of the desperate dry goods and other concerns down town, who lie in wait for customers, Andlb fore them to death with preliminary persuasions, before they are fai'lyi enrconised in their hotels.             - , But what is the Palace of Mirrors? and where is it situated? Is it advertised in the Tribune?  No-not exactly; but if-the Tribune could have its own way, we should soon have Palaces of Mirrors- all over the world. There was a small- attempt to establish something of: , the kind at Brook Farms, some years ago, by the Tribune- editors, edi- i tresses, philosophers, and reformers. But the men were all so mean, and the women so ugly, that the whole concern fell through, leaving poor Greeley, who may be termed the sumpter mule of modern reform to foot the bill and take thedliseomfited members of the affair on his back., Come with us, and we will show you what the " civilizers" have been able to effect in the way of antithesis to the Crystal Palace. I  The street is narrow and dirty, and not, it must be confessed, over respectable.  However, the rum-holes and disreputable places in thei l8eighborhood are not so numerous or so large as those iM the vicinity     38     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.. of the Crystal Palace. They are better frequented, and not nearly so well policed. The lamps are scarce and dim, and the odor in the air is anything but either Jockey Club or Vervain. Never mind-let us go on. If you get a thump on the head, or a stab in the side, don't cry out and make a noise-it's of no use; the policemen have all got their "soger clothes" on, and have gone up to the Crystal Palace, leaving the Palace of. Mirrors to take care of itself. Here we are, before a tall, dark-looking house, with a grated door. Let us ring. They have a peculiar etiquette at the Palace of Mirrors. When a visitor rings, the portress (a very magnificently dressed young woman, with bare arms and very low-necked gold and black brocade dress) turns the slats of the iron grating, and looks down upon the new-comer with a searching glance, that infallibly takes in everything in the appearance, manner, dress, and place of residence of the applicant for admission. You think your spruce new claret paletot, with that immense cravat, and that Jullienistic waistcoat, pass you off as a New Yorker . Not a bit of it. Our keen-eyed -portress has, "spotted" you in a moment. She knows you came from the prairies, where people are obliged to walk with their legs wide apart, on account of the high grass. Your paletot and cravat, waistcoat sand loosely-hanging trowsers, came ready made from Fulton street, and you board at the St. Nicholas or prescott. You are, in short, a country green-horn, come to New York to see the elephant, and: she thinks she will let you into the cage. You are a safe man. So, the door is unlocked, and uncained, (the elephant is a dangerous animal I) and we are ushered into a brightly-lighted hall, gaily decorated and chandeliered, with half-a-dozen fantastic-shaped sofas divanning the walls. These sofas have several occupants-gentlemen and ladies-the latter being all dressed in the most extravagant and startling style. The display of bare a ams and shoulders, of splendid dresses, and mag- nificent head-gear, quite overpowers you. However, nobody takes the least notice of you, except our portress, who asks- ,' Who do you wish to see, sir?" * "Why, the elephant. Doesn't he live here?" "He don't do nothing shorter I Walk into the parlor, and I'll trot him out." The parlor; well, this is a parlor I What magnificent carpets, spft as a baby's pillow I What brilliant rosewood furniture I what a splen- did grand piano! what delicious, cosy, velvet ottomans I And then the walls-one continuous mirror, reflecting you, and the gorgeously X undressed women who lounge on the luxurious sofas, and the furniture, the chandeliers, and all, even to the bust of Napoleon in the corner. The effect is magical, bewildering. You think you have been transport- ed into dream-land. And then the ladies-a little melo-dramatic, perhaps, but still mag- nificently got up. Such crimson cheeks and lips! such costly robes! Their manners are as luxuriant as their attire; and in a moment you find yourself perfedtly at mwne! *  *       *   * We have not time, this evening, to go through the other apartments of the Palace of Mirrors. If, like Asmodeus, we had the gift of un- roofing houses, we might discover subjects at which we ourselves should   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         39 be astonished. But we have seen enough to give us a general idea of this other side of the picture of our Crystal Palace, with its respectable and dazzling outside and inside. We will go. "No you don't I Aren't you going to call for some wine?" "Certainly, madam, if such is the custom: Champagne, if you please." The wine is very bad; but then it is so eheap I only three dollars a bottle! You couldn't expect a first-rate article for that price - And now-the witching hour of midnight has arrived-the fog from the bay comes up thick and impervious, like'a walking grey blanket-the comet has put. out its tail and gone to bed-President Sedgwick and his edito- rial revellers at the Crystal Palace have departed on the last down-town car, and the whole city is sinking into silence.' The echoes of the tiou- , sands of hurried footsteps have faded from the sidewalk-and as'we emerge into Broadway, all is silent, save the rattle of a distant cab, taking home a belated member of the Union Club, and the continuous, irrepressible murmur of the vast city-that human ocean, which ever ebbs and flows, remorseless and irresistible as the eternal destiny of which it is the symbol. { t J , ,                         -     CHAPTER X. A PLUNGE IN THE- SWIMMN.-BATH. PLOP I goes the fat man, whom we just saw waddling across the -Battery, with his face red as the full moon, and his whole man appearing about to melt. He stripped in marvellous quick time, and glided into the water like a large lump of warm fat. How gratefully to him, in every pore of his body, is the cool wave, embracing him in its soft, inexorable arms, no thin man can conceive. A lean man splashes and splutters about in the water like four sticks tied together. The only wonder is, why he ever came into it. There is no use in his trying to swim-that's clear; he would inevitably break his toes or scrape his shins, or even his knees, against the bottom. He belongs to the crane species-he can only keep his head above water by wading. But your fat, sleek, oily, contented man, like our friend who has taken the plunge, enjoys his bath with an active and positive enjoyment. The bath is his antithesis; and for the few moments it lasts, he is as much at home as if he were a very large and very clumsy fish, and, in fact, he very much reminds you strongly of a porpoise, as he goes wallowing and rolling and blowing about. There's Dandy C---, who has been told by his physician that the swimming-bath will permamently relieve the gout and general debility brought on by his incessant and indiscreet dissipations. At any rate, the doctor is conscientious. His skill can do nothing for decayed mar- rows, diseased livers, disorganized kidneys, and a general atrophy pro- duced by a premature exhaustion of all the forces of life. Dandy unfolds himself as carefully as if he was a contribution to the Crystal Palace, and had been marked " very fragile-this side up, handle carefully." Having neatly folded his clothes, and deposited them in a safe and dry place, he cautiously dips one great toe into the water and wdws back with a shudder and a "ugh I how cold it is!"Our fat friend, who is cruising lazily along shore, sees the state of things, and makes a sudden dive, which throws a barrel or two of water into the face and over the attenuated person of our roue. He gives a scream, falls back, and faints, like a fine lady. Everybody runs to the spot-nobody has any salts or French vinegar, and nobody is exactly in a state to go to the apothecary's. The fat gentleman, who has now come up, and is floating on the surface of the water, like a rich tit-bit in a bowl of turtle soup, suggests that water is a sovereign remedy for fainting away; and, it being at least the treatment nearest at hand, they all consent, and Dandy is thrust into the water. The fat man's therapeutics succeed admirably. The patient, after a few kicks and dying gasps, opens his eyes, and, taking a dismayed look of "'surrounding circumstances," screams, lustily. ,    ,   FIFTEEN MNUtTES AROUND NEWYORK.         41 "Oh, dear I .Oh, I shall be drowned I've gotthe cramp! iHelp me -But I Murder I Mur-!-bbl-uble-phltubble i Ah 1"- and the po6r'fellow, overpowered with .perhaps the first positive "Aensatidn" he ever had in his life, actually disappears beneath th water, The fat geitleman, who ishlying on his back, dying with laughter, reaches down and grabs Dandy by the hair, as he supposes, ^nd up comes-a wig I .  "What a fool, to go in, swimming with a wig on ": exclaims the in- dignant and cheated fat gentleman; iand, jtst cas he is preparing to ,nake another-dive, Dandy catches him by the leg, with desperate gripe, and drags him down, down I Things' begin: to look seriqIs. The fat gentleman, roused tothe high- ,est state of muscular activity, splashes, flounders,: and splatters so lusti- Jy, that itis no easy matter to approach. Dandyhaiigs on, like death, and -with that fatuity which :belongs exclusively to drowning -men and men in love, makes every: possible effort for his own destruction. At length, and-when affairs are evidently approaching a crisis, a Stalwart  Caiifornian--the bony and muscular embodiment of leanness, with a head like St. Paul, and a body like an omnibus horse-wades -upto the defendants in the case, and, with a jerk, throws the water-logged Dandy on: dry land, and lifts the gentleman once more into the air. Dandy, however, was pretty far gone. They had to take him away in a cab; :-nd we have heard nothing of him since. Here is a young and dainty fellow, with a just budding motutache, :and a skin as soft and white as a woman's. He is almost as modest, too, and blushes at the sight of his own legs, like a girl. W doubt -whether he will finally venture to extract himself from his 'chemise. Yes--he is looking around fearfully; and seizing a moment- when. he :thinks no one is watching, off it comes, and he, like a poor sinrer, 'Stands shivering on the brink, And fears to make the plunge." Poor, dear little fellow I He really quite -reminds one of Edymon, or some such moonshine. And now he has attracted the notice of a party of gamins, who have been making all Forts of mischief for half an hour, splashing themselves and everybody else, ducking one another and "holding 'em under" till they grew purple in the face, and could no longes breathe, and cutting up every imaginable " shine" which it enters into the heart of boys-terous youth to conceive, or its hands to execute. We fear our Miss Nancy will fare hard with them. He has not yet ventured into the water, but stands with his last gar- ment in his hand, very much in the attitude of Canova's Venus. One of our gamins comes up softly behind him, and, ke-wash! in he goes, his shirt flying in one direction and his legs and arms sprawling towards all points of the compass. His gasping cries are stopped by shouts of laighter-and one of the tormentors cries- "Hold him under, Jim I He's a green 'un 1" What may be the sensations of this poor devil the next minute and a half, we won't undertake to say ; but we should imagine they were something similar to those of poor stuttering Charles Lamb, who was ri: ducked three times by the Brighton bath-men, before he could manage ,to sputter out, "I'm to b-be d-dipped-only once!"     42     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. Here comes an old fogy. We shouldn't wonder if he were president of a mining company, or a director of the Crystal Palace, at the very least. He enters with a grave and stately step, looking round with awful dignity upon the place, and all that it contains. The atmosphere grows grim with respect, and the very water takes a brown and mud- dled hue, as if something of great importance were about to happen- perhaps a water-spout I The very shad in the bay keep well over to- wards the Jersey shore, and the vessels at anchor wheel slowly around with the tide, and point their noses seaward, as if ready for a sudden start. Endymion scrambles out of the water, wringing his shirt, in briny despair, and his white, satin skin looking like that of a young sea-gull. Our fat friend, who has by this time gotten himself completely rehabil- lated, walks off, giving a look askance at the old fogy; and even the' gamins themselves cower, shivering, in a crowd, and begin trying to insert themselves into their crumpled and unstarched garments. The Californian is the only one not overawed by the august presence. Wading up in front, of the old fogy, and looking at him with a comical-. expression, he says- "I say, old feller--give us a chor o' terbacker, will yer?" "Tobacco, sir t" exclaims Old Fogy, Esq., aghast. "Tobacco i Do you mean to insult me?" "Well, I'shouldn't mind, old hoss! Jest you come into this here small tin pan full of water, what they calls a swimmin'-bath in these emall-potatoe diggins, and ain't no obections to takin' a turn with you. Whooray! Who's afeard?" Old Fogy looks, reflects a moment, slips on his boots and trowsers, and muttering something about the "encroachments of democracy," disappears. Now for the ladies' department.   CHAPTER XI. 1   .FOURTH OF JULY    FROM  THE ROOF. THE CHLDREN had been listening every hour in the day for a week, to the incipient discharges of fire-crackers, which preluded the Fourth of July. To all the hints, insinuations, and charming inuendoes of the little people, aided by sundry expressive winks from mama, that a certain sum should be set apart for the purchase offire-works, we had resolutely  turned a deaf ear. Of course it was freely admitted, in these desultory and skirmishing conversations, that fire-crackers, as a general thing, were a nuisance -papa triumphantly exclaimed that he would like to see the little girl-or even the little boy-who could deny that! Still, it was contended that the great universal principle upon which society is con- ducted, of " doing as your neighbors do," demanded a certain sacrifice of individual comfort and convenience. Finally, as the best "compro- mise" that could be made on the occasion, it was arranged that two bunches of crackers should be let off on the morning of the " eventful day," in the back garden, in presence of the assembled community; aad that in the evening we should all go on the roof and see the fire-works all over the city. The Fourth, fortunately, was a little muggy, and consequently the tin roof was not quite melted off during the day. A cool and grateful beeze, even, sprang " all out of the west," and shed its delicious influences over roof and brow, side-walk and suspirating cithood. Immediately after dinner, while the sun, breaking out of its bondage of thin clouds, was pouring down beams hot enough to have broiled the cutlets and baked the strawherry pudding, to adjourn to the roof, for the purpose of being all ready "for the fire-works I This being overruled, we were amused for the remainder of the afternoon by the incessant cliek-clackery of crackers in boxes, in barrels, and in every way, going off and yet never going off, inevery direction. From the back window of the little drawing-room, there is a fine view of an entire blockof buildings, occu- pied by about a hundred and fifty German families, who seemed on this occasion to be particularly patriotic. . Every window had its pistol, or its noise-creator of some kind-all of Which were kept busy, as the bat- tery of a besieging army in a storm. One lusty fellow-the champion and hero of this sporadic zoll-verei--had got posession of a double-bar- relled gun and a horn of powder, and he loaded and fired with a " fatal facility" which would have made a hero at Monmouth or Boridini. His next-door neighbor played atrociously, throughout the day, on a clarionet ; ,and in the same block there were an accordeon accompanied by a squeak- ing sixteen-year-old treble; a third flute! and a bass trombone. 'Never before had we so full an appreciation of the national devotion of the Germans to music I r     "    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. At last the day, weary and disgusted with all the senseless noise, and unmeaning marching and countermarching-sick'at the stomach with the enormous quantities of nasty ice-cream and wilted oysters she had had been compelled to swallow-put on her grey night-gown, and giv- ing a last fiery look of indignant contempt at the world, went to bed, EC Like one who draws the draperies of his eouoh Around him, and lies down to dismal dreams." Then, upon every point and half point of the compass, settled in- tense and dusky silence. The engineers of rocket, pistol, cracker and Roman candle, for a moment retired into their back parlors, to refresh themselves with a cup of tea, before commencing the grand operations of the evening. We were all gathered around, in a state of intense expectancy- when- Phissss-s-s-ss-se I "What's that?" exclaimed the small people, in a state of intense ex- citement. "That is a rocket.", In twenty seconds from that announcement, the whole household were on the roof. Papa, who came last, got a glimpse of a pair of silk stockings, which had evidently been reserved for this "august occasion." Pillows, stools, and cushions, now found their way up through the sky-light, as if they had been put in communication with Dr. Gray and the spiritual rappers. The tin roof was not much hotter than a gridiron-and, all things considered, we were comfortably bestowed-especially as all sense of minor annoyance was lost in the intense exertion necessary to keep the children from leaping over the parapet or tumbling down chimney. And now, from every neighboring sky-light, uprose mysterious traps, giving place to heads of every sort, followed by the persons of our neighbors, all rigged out in their holiday attire, and evidently prepared to hold a grand levee on the house-tops. On the opposite roof, now appeared a neighbor who keeps a large establishment "down-town," and with whom we have struck up a sort of "Rockaway acquaintance," as John Keese did with his vis-atms, who ogled him from her rocking-chair over the way. After having greeted us with a grand military salute, he seemed to be very busy in extracting something from the sky-light through which he'had appeared. After a long time and an infinite deal of trouble, the trap was safely delivered of the wife and baby of our friend-and subsequently of the fat nurse, who duly screamed and tumbled over with modesty-after which she scrambled on all fours to the chimney, which she clasped affectionately in her arms, like a landsman hugging the mainmast in a blow off Cape Hatteras. Meanwhile, from all points of the compass began to rise faint, green- ish balls of light, like a regiment of will-o'-the-wisps who had lost their way, and were bobbing in and out of every chimney-top, in quest of somebody who could see them right. Here and there, an impatient rocket, chafing in its traces, went off prematurely, puffing and blowing its sulphurous breath into the cool face of evening, and trying vainly to, make an "appearance" against the gorgeous sunset sky--which, /   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         45 spreading all over the west a curtain of fire, embroidered with golden and rosy threads, mocked to scorn the ridiculous gunpowder imitations of mortals. In fact, it was clear that Apollo had been celebrating the Fourth on his own hook; and as he cast a disdainful parting look upon the earth, he seemed to say--"I have had my fun-go on with your fizzling 1" It was a curious spectacle-the rockets whizzing up into the sky, far and near, so that you could detect the various localities whence they issued. "There goes Washington Square!" cried the oldest and most learned of the babies, as a pearl-edged ribbon of fire unfolded itself above the roofs of the houses, and suddenly blew out into the magnificent blue and crimson artificial flower. "There's the Hippodrome! Oh, I know that's the Hippodrome!" screamed the little one of all-the red-cheeked pet, with a mouth the size of a rose-bud, and enthusiasm enough in her white bosom to upset a world or throw a drawing-room into confusion. But it wasn't the Hippodrome-which had as much as it could attend to in making " fetes of Verseilles," and other exhibitions. These beauti- ful rockets, which went up into the air like lillies born of fire, and embellished the dull leaden night with forms and hues of beauty, were but the avants coriers of the coming storm-magnificent, gorgeous, splendid beyond description or conception-which now burst in glory upon the night. For half an hour, we are sure the babies were crazy; and even we ourselves, as we lay on our back, propped up by three pil- lows, and watching like an astrologer the culmination of a star that seemed to have grown suddenly brilliant with jealousy of the corpora- ation glimmerings in Madison Square-even we were forced to confess that nothing quite so beautiful had ever been seen. Our position on the roof fortunately preserved us from the politician's necessity of taking sides, either by word or brickbat, with the grand battle between a boy and an omnibus-driver, on the one side, and three hundred members of an Irish society, on the other. Even at the slight elevation we had attained, we respired (with the exception of an infer- nal smell of roast mutton from the next chimney,) the free air of inde- pendence, and let the whole world crack, whistle and splutter by, far below us, without so much as exciting our attention. Gradually the babies and the air grew sleepy. Our neighbor on the opposite roof sent down his wife and baby through the trap-door, and gave a last puff at his cigar, as he also disappeared, with an indescribable air of resignation, incident to virtuous and well-trained married men. The sky, at length angry with all the imbecile mockeries that had been thrown in its face, began frowning and flashing lightning from its indig- nant eyes; and at length, heaven's fireworks leaped madly from the clouds, and played such fiery antics across the heaven as made even the most extravagant thoughts of man, tame and insignificant. Then it was that we stuffed the babies down the sky-light, followed by mamma, pillows, and other soft and cosy things-and, taking a last look at the rain-cloud that came passing down upon us, from the north, ended with. a plunge our quarter of an hour upon the roof.     CHAPTER XI  A QUARTER OF AN HOUR UNDER AN AWNING. SIx O'CLOCK and down-town-and a thick grey blanket spreading out all over the north and west. Broadway is a dense and turbid stream of people, flowing upwards. Men, women, children and little niggers, rush wildly up the sidewalk, hurrying to escape the coming- shower- while here and there prudent old gentlemen, (they are not nearly in the same proportion as the wise virgins spoken of in Scripture,) pick their way leisurely along, with their umbrellas ready for use, and a quiet chuckle of self-complacency on their faces. The rain has not yet come down-but it will come, and speedily. The question now is, "can we get home before it comes?"It is worth trying, at any rate-so, here goes for a dash into the struggling current. What enormous strides the women take, with their beautiful silks and fresh summer muslins wabbled up ingloriously about their ancles I They go like a quarter horse down the back stretch-passing every- thing on the road, and determined to pull up ahead of the party. Its no use-we can't keep up such a killing pace; and, besides, here comes the rain, in drops as big as eggs. We drop behind and take our stand under the awning at Chambers street, waiting for an omnibus. Under an awning in Broadway--waiting for a stage in a rapid rain- dash-at half-past six o'clock I There's a situation! and one which, if it could be fairly presented on the stage (we don't mean the omnibus) would draw the whole town after it. Here they come, gathering from all directions, crowding in beyond the line of rain, reaching over each other's shoulders, and maling frantic signs to every omnibus that passes -while the drivers, shaking the big rain-drops from their flapped hats with a most triumphant negative, splash on, leaving our awning con- gregation momentarily growing larger and more desperate. "Oh, good gracious me! suddenly exclaims a lady in the centre of this extempore mass-meeting, who wears a brilliant lilac bonnet, a green and orange silk dress, and flesh-colored silk stockings (easy to be seen) and lavender-colored boots. "Oh, my goody gracious I there's a hola in it and its all a-running down my back-and, oh my bonnet I it'll be clean spoilt!" "Hush, my dear-don't make a row; you shall have another." "Mhmh! I know I shall have another-but who knows whether I cap get another such one as this?" "I trust in Providence, my love, that you cannot. You certainly, can't do worse." 4      Snicker, giggle, he, he, he I from the crowd, sotto voce. "Brute!" "Darling!"   '  FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         47 Here's a stage at last, the driver of which' has pulled up. What a rush! There's a. man getting out. Help him out-pull him out- quick I hurry! Twenty umbrellas make a desperate dash at the - vacated place-one would almost think it was a vacant situation in the Custom House. No use I Off they go-four on the top, two on each side of the driver-two on the steps, and fifteen inside-twenty-two in all; as we do live by bread, 'tis true! And the discomfited nineteen, drenched and desperate, sneak back to the awning-which, by the way, is no longer much of a protection, except that it changes the shower without into a series of sporadic water-spouts, which pour down in steady streams on our devoted heads. The lilac bonnet is wilted long ago, and it now looks as if it had been a sugar bonnet, and all the extras had melted and run away. The owner would evidently like to follow its example; but the "brute" who paid for the bonnet looks at the fallen and smashed-up wreck with evident admiration-a sentiment he never entertained for it in the days of its pristine grandeur. Dinner was to be on the table precisely at six-and Jemima strictly enjoined it upon us to be punctual, as she and the girls were going out. Of course they can't go out such a night as this-but then, there are Jemimas, and Jemimas and punctuality are blessings. Don't it come down beaztiful! and just at this hour, too, of all others in the twenty-four! By the time one gets home thoroughly wet through, the storm without will have exhausted its fury, which will be transferred within. Who wonders at Caudle's untimely end? The stages rattle by in an incessant procession-every one apparently more crowded than the last: the drivers no longer deign even to look towards our melan- choly and stranded group, cowering like the last of a shipwreck, trying in vain to shelter themselves under the lea of the wave-washed deck.  We have an idea-let us take a seat in a down-town stage, and so stick to it till it returns. Lilac bonnet has just cast loose, with her convoy, and both are scudding under bare poles for the railcar, where they hope for better luck. Deluded mortals 1 The cars are all full and running over with down-towners, who had jumped on board to secure seats going up. A carriage of course is not to be. had--or, if it were, you would have to pay a week's salary for half-an-hour's use of it. No-there is but one alternative to waiting-and that is, wading. Lilac bonnet won't do either! She's evidently making up her mind to faint: that unsuccessful. trip to the railroad, and the return, have proved too much for her. There-she's off I Canry her into Rushton's, give her some ether or chloroform, establish her in an elegant attitude against that Windsor Soap box, and then run out and give "all the particulars" to that shark of a reporter who has been dodging in and out of the crowd during the whole affair.

The "gent" frowns sublimely at him-"Damme, sir, do you think I've got your dirty pocket-book V' "How did you know it was a pocket-book? He did't say what it was," remarks the astute reporter, who is rather up to snuff. so.                                   .     48     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. "That's him-hold him fast-I knows him!" exclaims a policeman, at this moment coming up-(he must have rained down 1) "How are ye, my covey? Come, tip-tain't no use--I knows yer of old, I does.' Our magnificent gentleman wilts instantly--as rapidly as the lilac bonnet. The policeman produces the pocket-book, from Whisker's out- side pocket-he all the while protesting, like the lover in Washington, that he hasn't the least idea how it got there. He begs the officer to step aside, and he thinks he can convince him, &c., &c. The proprietor of the restored pocket-book looks pleased-almost grateful. After fum- bling for a long time in his trowsers pocket, he drags out a very smooth quarter, and hopes the policeman will accept it, although, as a general rule, he; is opposed to paying public servants for the performance of their' duty: Policeman stares-and puts tongue in his cheek. Old gentleman wonders what that means-but he pockets the slighted quarter with evident satisfaction. Reporter takes a note, and, picking up an umbrella which the owner had leaned, dripping, against the fire-plug, scampers. off. Owner dumb with consternation, gesticulates violently in language which a member of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum would immediately- interpret into-"Here, you-rascal, bring back my umbrella!"Owner has a new Sat, and the umbrella is an old one: "A new hat on the- head is better than an old umbrella across the street."

But at. last there seems to be a lull-the mud-drops plop up less fiercely from the Ruiss--and, as if everything were about to come right at once, here is the very omnibus for which we have been waiting. Our- meeting under the awning has dispersed like a conclave at Tammany Hall, after the lights are turned off. The lilac bonnet has disappeared with, its, good-natured husband'; Don Magnificio Whiskers has paired off with the policeman; the owner of the new hat and the lost umbrella is staring vacantly in the direction where the reporter made his rapid exit; and the. red-faced financier and ourself start for the omnibus Wo are not malicious-but alls fair in omnibus riding.; and a sly trip of our respectable antagonist, quite by accident, lays him sprawling in the mud .. we mount the steps in triumph, and hurra for home. a wet welcome,. and a cold dinner I   :      CHAPTER XIII.  A STREAK OP SENSE-ANOTHER PEEP AT WALL STREET, OIOE more we find ourselves in Wall street, and attending up the Board of Brokers, the stock speculators, the money merchants and the financial operators generally of the street. But to let you a little into our confidence, reader, we have been very much at a loss whether to cast these individuals in our dissertation onithe mercantile world, or to lay them over until we come to the gambling houses and the lottery poli- cy shops-for the truth is that of all the gambling ever invented by the mind of man, the speculations in stocks, by which fortunes are realized and lost every day in Wall street, and whose stakes are millions, involv- ing the happiness or misery of whole classes, are the most absolute and unmitigated swindle-if gambling is swindling-and those engaged in them are all deserving of the State Prison. The buying and selling of "fancy stocks," by which is meant those stocks, and those only which are acknowlegegd by both parties and on all hands to be in themselves ntrinsically worthless-the whole business of marine, life and fire insur- surance, from its inception to its ultimate results-the manufactuing of paper currency-the buying and selling of real estate as carried on by our speculators-all these transactions are in fact and in spirit, noth- ing but gambling. Let us take the case of a fancy stock. By the help of lobbying and drumming and champagning the members of the State Legislature, a charter ha been obtained for a railroad from somewhere to nowhere, and by certitg hocus pocus operations, sham entries, and other conventional appearances, the charter secured, the stock ostensi- bly taken up and perhaps even a few miles of the road graded ; or if the operators wish to be particularly liberal, they may condescend to lay down a portion, even of the rails. It is very soon ascertained that this road, so far from ever paying a dividend on its capital, or remune- rating the stockholders, has no more chance of paying its expenses than a candle lighted at both ends of living till morning. So, after a strhg- gle or two for the sake of decency, the stock sinks into the unfathom.. able abyss of ill-considered and fraudulent speculations, and thereafter is known as a fancy." Nothing then remains but to get it out ini'the street and let the bulls and bears get hold of it-the one making'furi- ous efforts to toss it up, and the others hugging it as closely to pjui it down; and as the one or the other triumphs in dexterity in shuffling the cards, or by the heavier "pile" he is able to go upon his hand, the other is bluffed off and the stock 'for that day sinks or rises as the case may be. The transaction is looked upon as' extremely respbctable, and all the newspapers gravely report that "the fancies were someewhade. presed to-day, in consequence of the unusual delay of the arrival of the 4 P^^SAffrf?^^     50     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. steamer; or "there was a little more activity at the board to-day, and fancies generally increased from an eighth to a quarter, and a still far- ther improvement was apparent at the second beard." In extreme cases the disinterested editor adds that the "Reading" or "Harlem" or "Communipaw," or whatever stock lie happens to have been paid for puffing, appeared to be the general favorite with operators. The next day perhaps, without the slightest shade of change having come over the condition of the road, or the relations that existed concerning it and all the rest of the world, the stock goes up or tumbles down, the lucky operator pocketing his gains with a chuckle, the unlucky one pocketing his losses with a grin, and the bediddled community looking on with wonder and awe at these -astonishing evidences of the immens; commer- cial importance of New York. Insurance companies are founded upon an undisguised principle of gambling.. It is no more nor less than betting on a cord; while they have so multiplied and confused their calculations by the multiplicity, of their figuring, as to completely mystify the brains of their vietims, and make the chances come out by a very large per centage inevitably in their favor. There is no doubt that the operation of these companies has been to. a certain extent beneficial; but it is nevertheless gambling; open, palpable gambling; and the respective officers of these institu- tions with a palace in which to transact their business, and living in the most sumptuous and costly style, supporting extravagant families upon the proceeds and profits of their game, and the best and most unequivo- cal testimony that it is a game, and that the portion of the community who don't directly receive the security and advantage of the business must be plucked. As to the calculations necessary to demonstrate this fact mathematically, we have neither the time nor the patience, nor per- haps the requisite knowledge of details, to go into them; but it may be laid down as a settled proposition that the rich capitalists who insure, and the rich merchants who are insured, act like a pair of scissors, be- tween which a good slice of product of poor miserable laboring men and women who neither insure nor are inspied ev en from starvation,.are clipped away.  As to life insurance, it is of a piece with the other-a vast and cun- ningly devised scheme to excite the cupidity of, the ignorant, and draw from the earnings of the credulous poor the means for a few idle men to live in fashion, extravagance and luxury. Once a year or so the news- papers contain an extraordinary story of the wonderful advantages of life insurance-how somebody has died and left Mrs. Somebody five thou- sand dollars, for the education of the little Somebodies-and a great deal of gammon of that sort; but we who are behind the curtain of journalism, who see the puffs in manuscript, and know who bring, them in and pay for their publication, smile pityingly at these tales and lay them by in our memory with the accounts of wonderful cures by Smith's Universal Vegetable Pills, or the remedies for baldness invented by Brown, Jones or Thompson. The thousands of cases in which poor fel- lows have worked like dogs to scrape together the amount of the pre- mium from year to year, and at last by bad luck or illness have failed and lost all they haye paid, and thus been driven to dissipation or des- pair, are never recorded. If they were, life insurance would be soon at   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         51 a low ebb, and the fine fortunes made from conducting this business, would remain in the needy pockets of the destitute poor, from which they are extracted by the most equivocal of false pretenses. But there is a scheme of insurance which will yet be adopted that will be void of these objections and confer tenfold service and benefit upon the community. This is a system of mutual guaranteeism of every species of property, product or talent, skill or invention, interest claim or right of whatever description, made by the whole community to each of its members. The premium to, such a system of insurance would gradually and constantly recede from the enormous rates established by the present antagonistic, gambling. institutions called insurance companies, until it reached the merest nominal per centage of the entire value of the thing insured But, reduce this premium as we might, still the system would be so vast and so universally confided in, all its affairs being conducted with a limpid transparency into which all might look, that the profits would be enormous. But to this there would be no obligation; because the profits thus arising .to the com- munity at large from the transaction between itself and each member of the community, would of course belong to the community, and go to the payment of the expenses of government, and thus relieve individuals from just that amount of taxation. For instance, if all the insurance in the city of New York were done by the city itself, at a fractional premium compared with the present rates, the profits would support our entire city government, pay the whole expenses of police, gas, street and alms-house departments keep all our paupers comfortable, cure all the public sick, and pay the interest on our Croton water debt, without the necessity of taxing directly the citizens one single cent; whereas, in the present manner of distributing the profits of insurance, the wealthy property owners and the more prosperous classes only, receive the benefit of insurance-as the poor cannot afford to pay the premium; while the profits arising from the whole system go to support in extravagant idleness and corrupting luxury a few men and families, by no means among the, most valuable or most enlightened members of society. This is a subject which from the startling novelty of its suggestions will for a long time receive the go by among those pompous and self-sufficient classes who by the force of impudence and money are enabled to push themselves up over the heads of men of real talent, philanthropy and philosophy; but its time will surely come. The idea is so simple, so beautiful and so benevolent, and its consequences are so beneficient, practical and inevitable, that every mind which once fairly takes it in must inevitably become a con- vert to it; and thus little by little it will make way until the whole public mind has reached that state of developement and enlightenment, from which the project will burst into full bloom, and in due time bear its precious fruit. At all events, there can be no doubt that the present system, or rather no system, of insurance, especially the insurance of lives, is a mere hol- low, heartless and cruel mockery of assissance held out to the struggling poor--a hope most likely to fail at the moment that it should be most valuable and reliable.     CHAPTER XIV* A STROLL IN HOBOKEN-THE SYBIL'S SPRING ' IT WAS very warm-a sort of sultry, sticky day, which makes you feel as if you had washed yourself ia molasses and water, and had fofnd that the chambermaid had forgotten to give you a towel. The very rust on the hinges of the Park gates has melted and run down into the sockets, making them creak with a sort of ferruginous lubricity, as you feebly push them open. The hands on the City Hall clock droop, and look as if they would knock off work if'they only had sufficient energy to get up a strike. The omnibus horses creep languidly along, and yet can't stand still when they are pulled up to take in or let out passengers- the flies are so persevering, so bitter, so hungry I Let us go over to Hoboken, and get a mouthful of fresh air, a drink of cool water from the Sybil's spring, a good roll on the green grass of the Elysian Fields. Down we drop, through the hot, dusty, perspiring, choking streets-pass the rancid " family groceries," which infect all this part of the city, and are nuisances of the first water-and, after stum- bling our way through a basket store, " piled mountains high," we at length find ourselves fairly on board the ferry boat, and panting with the freshness of the sea breeze, which, even here in the slip, steals de- liciously up from the bay, tripping with white over the night-capped and lace-filled waves. Ding-dong I Now we are off 1 Hurry out to this further end of the bdat, where you see everybody is crowding and rush- Ing. Why? Why?

If you have corns, so, most likely; has your neighbor. At any rate, you can but try. No matter if your hat gets smashed, or one of the tails torn off your coat. You get ahead. That's tie idea-that's the only thing worth living for. What's the use of going to Hoboken, unless you can get there sooner than anybody else? Hoboken wouldn't be Hoboken, if somebody else should arrive before you. Now-jump!-climb over the chain, and jump ashore. You are not more than ten feet from the wharf. You may not be. able to make it -but then again, you may; and it is at least worth the trial. Should you succeed, you will gain almost another whole second! and, if you fail, why, it is only a ducking-doubtless they will fish you out. Cer- tainly they don't allow people to get drowned.

One would almost think that these disagreeable objects were placed there on purpose to enhance the beauties to which they lead. At last we are in the shady walk-cool and sequestered, notwith- standing that it is full of people. The venerable trees--the very same beneath whose branches passed Hamilton and Burr to their fatal ren- dezvous-the same that have listened to the whispering love-tales of so many generations of the young Dutch burghers and their frauleins- cast a deep and almost solemn shade along this walk. We have passed so quickly from the city and its hubbub, that the charm of this delicious contrast is absolutely magical. What a motley crowd I Old and young, men, women and children, those ever-recurring!elements of life and movement. Wel-dressed and badly-dressed, and scarcely dressed at all-Germans, French, Italians, Americans, with here and there a mincing Londoner, with his cockney gait and trim whiskers. This walk in Hoboken is one of the most abso- lutely democratic places- in the world--the boulevards of social equality, where every rank, state, and condition, existing in our c6untry--except, of course, the tip-top exclusives-meet, mingle, push and elbow  their way along with sparse courtesy or civility. Now, we are upon the smooth gravelled walk-the beautiful, magni- ficent water terrace, whose.rival does not exist in all the world.  Here, for a mile and a half, the walk lies directly upon the river, winding in and out with its yielding eutline, and around the base of precipitous rocky cliffs, crowned, with lofty trees.  From  the Bay; and afar off through the Narrows, the fresh sea breeze comes rushing up from  the Atlantic, strengthened and made more joyous, more elastic by its race of three thousand miles-as youth grows stronger by activity.  Before us, fading into, a greyish distance, lies the city, low and murky, like- a huge monster-its domes and spires seeming but the scales and protu- berances upon his body. One fancies that he can still hear the fainmur- mur of his perpetual roar.  No--'tis but the voice of the pleasant waves, dashing themselves to pieces in silver spray, against the rocky shore. The retreating tide calls in whispers, its army of waves to follow to their home in the  Sea. Take care-don't tumble off these high and unbalustraded steps,-or will you choose rather to go through the turn-stile at the foot of the bluff ?    It is very lean, madam-which you are not--and we doubt if you can manage to find your way through.    We   thought so I  Allow me to help you over the steps.  They are placed here, we verily believe, as a    practical illustration of life-- upone side of the hill, and down  the other-for there is no material, physical, or topographical reason, that we can discover, for their existence. Here is a family group, seated on the little wooden bench, placed under this jutting rock. The mother's attention is painfully divided equally between the two large boys, the toddling little girl of six, who laughs and claps her hand with glee at discovering that she cant throw a pebble into the water, like her brothers-and the baby, who spreads out his hands and legs to their utmost stretch, like the sails of a little boat which tries to catch asmuch of the breeze as it can, and who crows like a little chanticleer, in the very exuberance of his baby exis.    54     B FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. tence. Two half-nibbled cakes, neglected in the happiness of breathing this pure, keen air-which, by the way, will give them a tremendous appetite, by-and-by-are lying among the pebbles, and even the baby has forgotten to suck its fat little thumb. The Sybil's Cave, with its cool fountain bubbling and sparkling for, ever in the subterranean darkness, now tempts us to another pause. The little refreshment shop under the trees looks like an ice-cream plas- ter stuck against the rocks. Nobody wants "refreshments," my dear girl, while the pure cool water of the Sybil's fountain can he had for nothing. What I Yes they do. The insane idea that to buy some- thing away from home-to eat or drink-is at work even here. A little man, with thin bandy legs, whose bouncing wife and children are a practical illustration of the one-sided effects of matrimony, has bought "something to take" for the whole family. Pop goes the weasel!I What is it? Sassaparilla-pooh 1 Now let us go on round this sharp curve, (what a splendid spot for a railroad accident ) and then along the widened terrace path, until it loses itself in a green and spacious lawn, lovingly rising to meet the stooping branches-of the trees. This is the entrance to the far-famed Elysian Fields. Along the banks of the winding gravel paths, children are playingi with their floating locks streaming in the wind--while prone on the green grass recline weary people, escaped from the week's cease- less toil, and subsidingjoyfully into an hour of rest-to them the highest happiness. The 'centre of the lawn has been marked out into a magnifi- cent ball ground,- and two parties of rollicking, joyous young men are engaged in that excellent and health-imparting sport, base ball. They are without hats, coats, or waistcoats, and their well-knit forms, and elastic movements, asthey bound after the bounding ball, furiishi grati- fying evidence that there are still classes of young men arhong us cal- culated to preserve the race from degenerating. Yonder in the' corner by that thick clump of trees, is the merry go- round, with its cargo of half-laughing, half-shrieking juvenile humanity, swinging up and down like a vessel 'iding at anchor. Happy, thought- less voyagers! Although .your baby bark -moves up and down, and round and round, yet you feel the exhilirating motion; and you think you advance. After all, perhaps it would be a blessed thing if your bright and happy lives could stop here. But time hurries you-on irresisti- bly,to what destiny may'have in store for you. Never again will you be so happy as now; and often, in the hard and bitter journey of life, you will look fondly back to these infantile hourg, wonderingif the evening of life shall be as peaceful as its morning. But the sun has swung down behind the'Weehawken Heights, and the trees cast their long shadows over lawn- and river, pointing with waving fingers our homeward' road. The; heart is calmer, the head clearer, the blood cooler, for this delicious respite. We thank thee, oh green Iloboken, for thy shade, andfresh foliage, and tender gass, and the murmuring of the glad and breezy waters--nd especially for having furnished us with a subject for this Chapter,   CHAPTER XV. THE' ELDRIDGE   STREET JAIL. BEING in the- vicinity of Walker and Eldridge streets, the other day; our attention was attracted by a small wooden rotunda surmounting an ordinary looking two story dwelling-house. Crossing over from the immense and cleanly-kept private market, or abattoir, which occupies the corner, we read on the wall of this house, "Admittance to the Jail through the basement, from 9 till 4. No admittance on Sundays." This, then, was the "Eldridge street Jail," of which we hear so much. Not having, for our own part, any idea of this renowned public institu- tion, we were determined to pay it a visit "through the basement," and see what it was like. At the doorway we met the Cerebus, in the shape of a civil, quiet, gentlemanly looking man, who was puffing away lustily at a cigar:. "Good day, sir! I have come to ask the privilege of going through the jail." "Certainly, sir-but for what purpose?" "For the purpose of describing it. I am a writer for the press." "'What press?" "Oh, you will see when it comes out." After some further inquiries, as to whether any of the prisoners had written to us, and an indignant remonstrance on our part at the bare possibility of being mistaken for a shyster lawyer, Mr.'Smith--yes, that is his name, Henry J. Smith-invited us into the place where the spi- der asked the fly. Passing through a narrow passage into the back basement, we found a young humpbacked Savoyard, some sixteen years old, busy trimming some lamps. He is an important, witness in the case ofthie' Frenchman who was shot in New-York last March, arid is detainedhere as witness for: want of bail. This seems a great hardship, in the abstract, and' sometimes practically, is one. But what are you to do? It frequently so happens, that either 'the ends of justice nibut be foregone, or an important witness detained. In the preset case, for' instance, nothing would be easier than to induce this uncultivated young dwarf to disappear, if he had been left at large. He. is not subjected to a rigorous confinement, but is employed by the family of Mr. Smith in various household duties. He speaks English, and says he is quite as well satisfied with this life as any other. He is a perfect specimen of his race, and only wants a hurdy-gurdy, or a cage of white mice, to make a splendid study for Mount or Freeman. There are generally not' more than twelve or fourteen prisoners con. fined in this jail. Indeed, it could not well accommodate a greater number. The only provision for their confinement being a single row     56     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND. NEW YORK. *   - f of narrow cells, running along the second story, and opening into a general passage. The prisoners are not kept apart, and the greater number of them were amusing themselves at a game of leap-frog, at the lower end of the hall, laughing and shouting as madly as a company of school-boys. A majority of prisoners here are sailors, arrested for a constructive re- volt, in refusing to go to sea on the vessel where they have been ship- ped by their boarding-house master. The pernicious system of sailor boarding-houses is now so extended and ramified; that the whole body of our seamen are subject to its hardships, extortions, and rascalities. Every sailor, the moment he sets his foot on shore, becomes literally the property of some boarding-house keeper, who, if he does not succeed at once in inducing Jack to give him all his money in a lump, manages to get possession of it in a short time, through the inducements of the bar- room, and the seductions of the fair damsels with whom he is in league, or who frequently are in his employment. -Jack then must run in debt, of course, for his board; and the landlord then begins to ill-treat him, and to " knock him about like a dog," (as Greeley says the policemen in London do the quiet citizens,) until he chooses to ship him, in any direction, or any vessel, and for any price, he pleases. Sometimes Jack, taken on board half drunk, objects to the arrangements when he gets sober, and refuses to go to sea. This our wise marine laws convert into a revolt, and the poor devil, who has neither friends nor money, is con- signed to the care of Mr. Smith, until he becomes placable. The other class of prisoners confined here is composed of non-resi- dents, committed for debt, or persons accused of fraud, under some of the many and oppressive forms of our barbarous laws on this subject. Among these victims of our ridiculous enactments, and their perver- sions by lawyers, is one old gentleman, with a bright eye and benevolent grey head, who has been incarcerated now for over three years, for the heinous crime of endorsing a note, and not being able to pay it when it became due. If he had not been a non-resident, or if he had had plenty of money, he would not have remained there three days. As it was, a lawyer got hold of him when first he came in, plucked him of thirty or forty dollars, and then sold him to the other party. At length, after nearly three years of anxiety and suspense, he got another lawyer, by the advice of Mr. Smith, (to whom he expresses the greatest gratitude for his kindness)--and then, when the motion was made to discharge the prisoner, for the reason that the plaintiffs neglected to prosecute, their attorney produced a letter from the prisoner's former lawyer, re- questing them not to prosecute the case at present, and signed by him as "counsel for the defendant!" Doubtless the shyster had been well paid for this dodge-and the poor fellow still remains in jail. He has a happy, contented disposition, however, and says he enjoys himself very well. He has a cribbage board and a pack of cards, and his little room is got up with some considerable taste-the walls being ornumented with several engravings in handsome gilt frames-and his cot looked clean and tidy. Another prisoner has been in durance for over two years, on a charge of fraud in selling out the goods of a partnership concern. 'He is mo- rose and taciturn, and does nothing but smoke. Another, an Bnglish-   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NBW     YORK.      57 man, was arrested on some trivial pretence, but being unable to procure bail, must remain until i s the good pleasure of his persecutors to let him out. In short, so far as we can judge, all this part of our iode is a sheer oppression, more barbarous than the old imprisonment for debt laws. Under the present statute and code of procedure, a man can be arrested upon an affidavit stating that the plaintiff has reason to believe that the defendant is about to leave the State, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors-and on this he may be held in confinement for years, with no power (if he has neither friends nor money,) to force the case to a trial, and establish his innocence. Common humantiy calls loudly for some provision by which the rights and liberty of strangers and unfortunates should be protected, as well as those of the wealthy and influential creditor. Among the other victims of the present state of things is a poor negro, who made some money in California, which he loaned to his employers, and took it out in "rot-gut" liquor, in which they dealt. Having over- drawn the sum, about twenty-five dollars, according to their account, they had him arrested here, as he was about to return to California, and had paid his passage on the steamer. He can neither read nor write, and his case is one of very grear hardship. The better class of prisoners-that is, those who have money-are not confined in cells, or subjected to prison fare, but have the range- of the house, and board at Mr. Smith's private table-for wrich they pay ten dollars per week. This is the only remuneration Mr. Smith receives- being entitled for his depaty-ship only to house-rent. . Among this latter class of prisoners, the Danish naval officer figured, last week, for several. days,.buit he is now at large. Mr. Smith seems to be a very kind-hearted, plain minded man; and it is clear that, bad as it is, the Eldridge street prison has been much worse. The old prisioners are enthusiastically grateful to him for the many meliorations he has introduced in their treatment; we were going to write meal-iorations, bat we haven't time.     CHAPTER XVI. MY UNCLE'S. TnH play of "Simpson & Co." is performed much oftener than is announced in either small bill or poster; and, although at its most fre- quent representations, the audience is not large, yet it is select and curious enough to attract us there, rather than to the rush of the regu- lar dramatic establishments. If you like, reader, you may go with us to witness one of these by-plays in the great melo-drama of city life. It is eleven o'clock in the forenoon. The down-town omnibuses have disgorged themselves of their thousands of fat and sleek citizens, who have sought their offices and counting-houses, to take up their hand in the endless game of speculation, at the point where yesterday they laid it down, and to go on winning and losing thousands, with many a heart- pang, but with imperturbable faces. There is no current of travel yet established upwards, and the jaded horses crawl slowly along with the vehicles half filled with miscellaneous strangers, strayed away from the routine march of the great army of business. Let us get into this Dry Docker, and seek our promised amusement. There-pull the strap before this tall house with three golden balls suspended over the door. This is the residence of my Uncle. A curious, eccentric, benevolent old gentleman is he-so profoundly affected by the wants and necessities of the poor, that he has fitted up, all at his own expense, a neat and comfortable place-a sort of compromise between a fancy bank and a police office;-with coubters and shelves, and fur- nished with fifteen or twenty clocks of all paterns and ages, and with every sort of face upon which old father Time has ever laid his hands- all ticking away independently, and pointing out all sorts of hours and minutes in the most provoking and obstinate way, as if they were really human. On the lower shelves are arranged innumerable rouleaus in paper, with the ends t1ghtly screwed up like little kinkey tails. A sour, Barnaby Rudge looking fellow stands at the back shelf, with about two bushels of pennies before him, from which he is industriously making up rouleaus and adding to the pile. Half-way up the counter is a division, separating it into two stalls. Behind the counter, with the face to the audience, stands the master of ceremonies--my venerable uncle himself I He has a high, benevolent forehead, with a large development of the organ of ideality, and fine, silken hair, now faded to white, whose texture indicates a nervous and highly sympathetic organization. If phrenology is not at fault, this old gentleman must be one of the most angelic men that ever existed. -The door opens, and'enter a man and woman-a gentleman and lady, we ought to say, by their dress. Each carries a large bundle, wrapped i          ,   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUNb NEW YORK.         59 it white muslin and secured by innumerable pins. The lady hangs back -the gentleman makes a big gulp, strides fiercely up to the counter, and blurts out- "I have some articles here, sir, upon which I wish to raise some money. Will you examine them?" My Uncle is not at all frightened at this salutation from th'e ferocious young gentleman-probably takes pity on his youth. He does not examine the " articles"--he examines the young man. "What articles are they, sir?" asls. My Uncle, in a quiet, silken voice. "Look at them," gaspsthe young man, turning very red. The benevolent old gentleman complies without a word. He takes out the pins, removes the wrappers, and turns over daintily about a dozen magnificent and costly dresses-silk, satin, lace and brocade, evidently made up in the height of style. "What do you want for these?" says my Uncle, insinuatingly. "They are worth $300--but of course I don't expect anything like their value. I must take what you will give." "You can have $30." "Only that? For God's sake give me fifty-I mtvst have fifty l" My Uncle didn't even get angry I He merely turned on his heel and walkid to the other end of the-counter: The young man looked at his companion--her eyes were glistening with tears. My Uncle had turned in his walk, and again stood opposite the young man. He lifted the bundles and gently pushed them towaids him. "I-must-take the money." My Uncle said not a word-he turned to & little drawer behind him, and counted out the money-the young man made a grab, clutched the bills, stuffed them into his waistcoat pocket, and bolted out of the office, , apparently forgetting all about the lady, who followed with a frightened step. Meanwhile a poor, thin, cadaverous-looking woman, who had been for some moments standing shrinkingly at the counter, came forward, and with a pale, haggard, trembling hand, offered My Uncle a little roll of cloth. It was composed of two little chemises-such little, dainty things- made for an infant. The material was fine, and the workmanship exquisite. "Eighteen pence," said my uncle, flinging the article to Barnaby, who counted out eighteen pennies from his big heap, and handed them to the woman without looking at her. We believe her heart broke as she pressed her hand to her eyes, and staggered out of the office. There now entered a gaunt, sallow-faced man, dressed in seedy black. His eyes are wild, and he has a startled look, like that of insanty. He is an opium-eater-dying for lack of his indispensable stimulus, and fear- ful that this last effort to get the means of procuring it may fail. He has a little package in his fingers, and deposits it on the counter. My uncle knows this visiter. He looks at him with pity, almost comtempt. The package contains a plain gold ring. The story is told'in a word. The poor opium-eater i a widower-thiis his wife's wedding-ring. He    .     60     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. has brought it to throw into the maddening fire that consumes his heart and brain. Fortunately, he will die in a few days. My Uncle sees this, and gives him a handsome amount for the ring-six bright- new quarters. The man's wild eyes gleam more brightly; he clutches the money convulsively, and hurries away as fast as his thin, tottering legs can carry him. He has the advantage over some of us, after all- he will have at least a few hours of happiness. Who dare hope for more? Have you seen enough for to-day? My Uncle is fast beginning to warm in his benevolent functions, and smiles faintly as the door opens more and more frequently. Already quite a crowd has gathered at the counter. A motley crowd, forsooth I Squalid beggary, with its last spoon to pawn for rum-starving gentility, blushing with shame, through cheeks haggard with want-drunken and mad-eyed genius, ready to pawn soul and body for another dram-childhood cowering in hunger-- timid and shrinking girls-disease, starvation-every form that misery takes to escape, to the last moment, theft and prostitution, My Uncle, after all, is a benevolent gentleman, let his enemies say what they will. He supplies money to the needy when all others refuse, and only charges 25 per cent. interest, meanwhile keeping safely the property of the poor, and allowing them abundance of time to retrieve it. His banking house is a fruitful place for the study of human nature, and his "deposits" a most melancholy and motley collection of human misery. Good-bye, uncle-may we never need a better friend or more accommodating relative!"   CHAPTER XVII.  BEHND THE SCENES. IT is seven oclock-and at a dark,;mysterious-looking little door, in a side street, suspicious looking characters, male and female, have been stealthily entering. Most of them carry bundles under their arms, and now and then enters a boy with a basket, preceded by a woman. What are all these people, and where are they going? Stop-here comes a carriage, which pulls up at the little door. 'A lady gets out, followed by a maid and a bundle, and all disappear together behind the mysteri- ous door. Is it the private entrance to a foundling hospital? or is there to be an evening pic-nic, to which every guest brings his contribution? We will follow, and find out this mystery. Inside the door, we are met by a little man perched on a high stool, and acting in the character of Cerebus, to what, from the profund dark- ness, may well be the entrance to the infernal regions. We are stopped at the first step. "Do you belong to the company?" "Certainly-don't you know?" "Oh, yes-all rightl-go ahead." The company I What company? He says he knows; in which he has decidedly the advantage of us. All right-go ahead I Not so easy, in a strange place, where there is not the leastray of light. How- ever, it seems we "belong to the company," whatever it may be, and we must, of course, therefore, "go ahead." Let us feel our way care- fully. Ugh I what a stumble I And there goes our left shin against the sharp corner of something-what next? Isn't that the feeble glimmer- ing of a ray of light? Patience and perseverance, and so-we tumble down a flight of stairs. No bones broken-" go ahead!"A few feet. further brings us to a wild, strange, unearthly-looking place, partially lighted by perpendicular rows of gas burners, running along tall move- able partitions. A great many people are scattered about in all sorts of costumes and equipment. Here a squad of soldiers in loose 'tights and Chatham street uniforms, made to fit anybody, are gqing through the manual exercise, and manceuvring about the large open space in the centre. The captain of this band has a great deal of trouble to make his gallant followers all turn in the same direction; but at length he seems to be pretty well satisfied with their performances. In this corner a young lady, with extremely thin and still'shorter pet- ticoats, and legs quite as thin, but a good deal longer, is holding on to a projection from one of the wings,.and indulging in a series of the most extraordinary leaps, jumps, and strides, to the imminent danger of our-     B 2    FIFTEEN MNUTES AOUND NEW YORK. nose and her own neck. That is the dansense who is practising the pas sed, which she is to perform between the pieces. Though she is not wanted for an hour and a half, yet she always is the first to be " out and dressed "-or rather undressed-and amuses herself during the first piece by flirting with the actors as they come off the stage, and by quia- zing the actresses. Behind, the flat, "third groove, U. E..," several strangely assorted men are walking, each with a little book or a crumpled manuscript in his hand, and assidiously talking to himself. Generals, servants, British and Americans, an Irishman with an extraordinary red wig, all are mix- ed up promiscuously, or walking amicably side by side, and jabbering away, incessantly: to thetselves. AFrom their .grtesqnue costumes and strange gesticulations, you would imagine that we had penetrated into the interior of a lujatic asylum, on a holiday.

Amid the scene, running in and out everywhere, :bring all -sorts of queer utensils and "properties "--canes, coffeepots, parchments, pipes and tobacco, crowns and crockery, snuff-boxes and sandwiches--is. that all-important character, the property man. , He seems to feel the weight of a gigantic responsibility resting upon his shoulders. Atlas was no- thing to him. He must be everywhere at once, and have everything with him. Should a proclamation or a poker, a ;wa candle or a wed- ding ring, be out of place at the instant it was wanting-woe be to him 1 The world would stop I And now the prompter, with an air of the intensest bustle and impor- tance, makes his appearance-damning, as a point of conscience, every- thing that the poor perspiring property-man has so laboriously accom-  plished-upsetting all his arrangements with a kick and a pshaw I (sup- posed to be one of the veritable " kickshaws," heard of nowhere but on the stage)-and has everything all done over again. He looks at his watch, (a silver patriarch of watches, of the days when watches, as well as men, were twice the size they are at present,) and wonders " whether that d---d leader has come yet ;" and vows that, if he doesn't arrive in two minutes, he will ring in the orchestra without him i" As if in reply to this terrific threat, a little Frenchman, with gold rings in his ears, and a stealthy, gliding pace, like a cat, suddenly. ap- pears, and as suddenly disappears down a trap. The prompter, watch in hand, rushes to the side of the curtain where his little desk, palisaded *with bell-handles, is fastened to the wall. He touches one of these little handles, and looks anxiously at a quiet personage in black, who has been for some minutes standing in the centre of the stage, with his eye applied to a minute hole in the greeh curtain. At length, as if satisfied, or at all events resigned, at the appearance of the audience-which, for some time past, has been growing more and more noisy and obstreperous -he raises his hand to the prompter-a little bell tinkles-the orchestra snap their fiddle-strings, give the reed mouth-pieces a preparatory sneeze -the horns and trombones give a preliminary grunt-the piccolo blows his nose-the bass drum stamps with impatience-and off they go. The "first music, consisting of a magnificent introduction inisix flats,   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUID NEW-YORK.          -63 writtten by our little leader, in imitation of Beethoven's symphony in A minor, after ;eight bars and; a rallentsado as long as your arm, sud- denly fizzles into a sixth-rate German walt, .with which,the audience are So ,familiar, (having heard itevery night of the season,) that they materially. increase the force of the ' wind instruments,'" by whistling and .inging it in'concert. Meanwhile,'an intense activity prevails on the stage. The grand lady who ;arrived' in a carriage, now makes her ,appearance, dressed like a princess, but rather more highly colored in face and ,bearing than would, perhap, be, admisible at, a queen's drawing-room. The stage- manager, (who, of course, has cast himself for a leading light comedy part, altho ugh his fort is the heavy murderer business,) " sets the stage " withall due pomposity for the first scene. The aetors' and, actrewses-- the, "'titteipeople" and "general utilities"-drop along, one by,one, from trap doors and wings, and invisible stair-cases from ;the "flie," where the dressing-rooms are perched like birds' nests, among the branches of canvass trees. At last everything is ready-the orchestra have wheezed and gasped and squeaked their way through "Der Freischut's," the stamping, whist- ling and shouting of the audience have subsided, like a hushed storm -the stage-manager utters the order, " clear the stage!" the prompter, by this time grown very red and desperate, rings the fatal bell-the pro- perty-man starts convulsively and looks wildly at his tea-cups and tog- geries-and up goes the curtain! Meanwhile, the,characters not " on" till the second scene-those for- tunates who don't play in the first piece, but are wanted for the farce- the manager in close confab with the next " star," with whom he is set- tling the preliminaries of an engagement-all congregate in the green- room, whence the call-boy summons whoever may be wanted. Here wit, fun, good humor, generally prevail. Sometimes, perhaps, a little subdued scandal, or flirtation, in the style of fashionable drawing-rooms, may be carried on. But in every well-conducted theatre the tone of in- tercourse, conversation, and manners, is as strictly comrne ilfaut as in the most irreproachable circles of private society; while the conversation is much more witty, sparkling, and amusing than you can ever hope to meet among hum-drum, every-day people. The members of the thea- trical profession, from the very necessity of their daily and nightly pro- fessional duties, are obliged to acquire a quickness of apprehension, a familiarity with elevated sentiments, and an acquaintance with at least the forms of good breeding and civilized intercourse, which are unfortu- nately too rarely to be found in our self-conceited, ignorant, purse- proud, and puritanical "good society." The effect of this is seen in the- personal character of actors and ac- tresses. They are gay, light-hearted, good-humored, and unquestiona- bly the most kind-hearted and benevolent creatures in the world. No distressed actor ever appeals in vain to his brethren for aid, and all are ever ready to give their time and services on the slightest provocation, without stopping to inquire why or wherefore. As to the slanders and calumnies uttered against the morals of the profession, they do not deserve answer, for they only proceed from peo- ple who know nothing about the subject. At any rate, the idea of im- x 1     "    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. moral or criminal conduct in the green-room, dressing-rooms, or behind the scenes, is simply preposterous. All who have ever been behind the Acenes, well know that such a thing is impossible, as much, as it would be on the shilling side of Broadway. It is the very last place in the world for such a thing. Doubtless, a kind of light and playful badinage is sometimes indulged in, such as we alluded to in the case of our vain danseuses, but as to the idea of anything improper, it is ridiculous. We- are not responsible for what people say, either in the green-room, the drawing-room, or the church. Immorality and seduction may set traps in all; but we willingly avow that the maners of the green-room are at least equal to those generally prevailing in society. But the curtain is down-the " act music" is sawing away, and the performers are trooping towards the green-room. We have no right here, and it is only by special favor that we have been permitted to re- main so long. Having got in clandestinely, as" one of the company, we must make the best of our retreat, with as little ceremony as possi- ble.   3;1:       ACHAPTER      XVIII.  ,TBIE BLOOMERS IN BROADWAY.

Of course I am ever on the watch for every new fashion, and have sometimes ven- tured to -invent some peculiarly becoming to myself, which, under the sanction of the French name (I did not dare openly to avow my author- ship) my intimate friends have adopted; by that means, much to my enjoyment, making great frights of themselves. Imagine, then, how my curiosity must have been roused by this novel innovation which has threatened to annihilate the whole race of flounces and trimmings upon which our taste and attention have for many-years been lavished. I own, however, I was somewhat startled by the annoucement that we were to leave off petticoats; but the recollection of a very tiny foot and a very well formed leg soon reassured me; I hope you are not shocked at my mentioning this last circumstance. I suppose as it is no longer immodest to show our legs, it is no longer improper to talk of them. Accordingly, I resolved to be the first to set the example, and to connect my name with the first bien port&e St. Simonien dress in -New York. I give then this name to it, because, after all, this drss is neither a Turkish dress nor a novelty, but only the dress introduced by the first socialists (the Saint Simoniens, in Paris,) some twenty years ago. My French governess told me this-pray don't think I can remember anything so far back. Well, I got this dress made of the most beautiful material and it fitted--oh I so exquisitely I Ester nous -a tailor had made it, for you know dress-makers can't make trowsers, so they will soon be of no- use; I put it on, and having stuck a grey hat, called a 'wide-awake,' sideways on my head, I assdre you I made the prettiest little manuis sujel imaginable. It was night, however, when I tried these things on; so, resolving to go down Broadway in them on the morrow, I took them off, exchanged my trowsers for my 6     "    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. long, flowing night dress, (is this to be curtailed too?) and my hat for my little valenciennes-trimmcd night-cap. I confess, after all, on look- ing in the glass as I tied it on, that I thought it was quite as agreeable to be a pretty woman as a pretty boy; then laying my head on my pillow, I .went to sleep. Now comes the wonderful part of my story-I am almost afraid to tell it, but surely if grave magistrates, profound philoso- phers and eminent physicians believe in vulgar, prosaic knockings, and listen to horrid, illiterate spirits, who can't even say the words without first spelling them, surely you, dear Mr. Foster, who are a poet, will believe the apparition of sylph. Yes, a soft, murmuring noise, like the summer breeze through the thick foliage, roused me from my slumbers. A delicious perfume filled the air, whilst a brilliant effulgence lighted  the whole room--then, suddenly and but for a momept, the eetest ra:lization iof all one "iiagines to be an etherial being, appearee before me, and gently bending over me, touchedn me with its wing and'disap- peared, leaving in my hands the following address, whichX 6i hac tran- scribed on mortal paper, having myself secreted from all c01ntamination the real' maiiuscript from' the unreal' world; though I miglt have sent it to the journal dictated by the spirits, which/ is I believe, fte treing printed in vulgar type, noW circulated bodily amongst us b51,t, eared from the real, practical sense and ability of my spirit, sreitatiqpt , the mystic editoirs might doubt its authenticity for what lthertoieen s to add to the mysterious incomprehensibility of the knocking spiiits .i the utter uselessness of all they say or do-but  "Some secret truths, from learned pride concealed,' ;To maids alone and children are revle'dd" ' And now I leave, being assured you would; rather read the produc- tion of the golden pen' of a seraph thathat of the' humble' ffoeiquill of one who is but figuratively an angel in the eyes of her adiiireimS Your constant reader,          '   N ' .BIDA.

Ever from time immemorial has the flowing 'draper y, now cFlled a petticoat, been assigned to all to whoom homage  was due.  The Jewish rabbi, the Egyptian Pharaoh,; the 'Roian Emperor, the infallible Pope, the Venetian Doge, the Holy Friar, have amongst men been robed in flowing skirts; shall woman think she raises her position, then, by doffing that garment which men borrowed from her when they wished, by outward signs, to signify authority and command respect? In later ages, in the days of chivalry, men the most valiant stooped to kiss the hem of woman's robe'; and now how often does the rustling of redundant silk make hearts as brave and noble as theirs, beat, which the contact of buttons and broadcloth would not have power to move I Will manly coats and scanty pantaloons supply the sheltering folds around the expectant mother's form'; or will sutch rough attire content the baby's form, whose haven is its mother's lap, nestling the while warm and snug in her bosom, amidst soft folds of muslin, when the contact with its father's clothes chafes its fair skin and leaves its tiny form unsheltered? No; whatever her vagaries, woman will be a mother still. My sylph need weep no more. And the young girl, whose form so round and delicate seems to suggest the very texture which she wears, what will she look like, but a reedy, weakly lad, "n awkward likeness of her elder brother? For once, my faw young charges, let your sylph persuade you ; do not rush to womanly extremes; retain your womanly apparel; let the long robe sweep along the floor of the homes and caress the daisies of the spring turf; as you walk, a hundred sylphs shall bear each fold aloft; restrain the awkward foot; arrest the impending rent. Why aim at taking from man the very dress pronounced by fifty years of artists as the perfection of ungainly ugliness I Yet, as I have allowed the long, flowing skirt of the habit, so would I thus suggest that, as gradually from that mental superiority it needs no borrowed aid from dress to proclaim, and which each year will rapidly develop, you are brought into the battle of Active life and forced to buffet with the elements, you would adopt not Turkish nor Moorish trowsers, but trowsers just loose enough to conceal the shape of the limb it covers, made in dark cloth, fastened round the top of your own gaiter boots-then wear a high tunic to the knee of the same material, thickly plaited round the waist, a black leather belt with the aumoniere at the side for your handkerchief and purse; reveal at the wrists and round the throat a dazzlingly white collar and cuffs, put on yonr head the broad sombrero of the Spaniards, and go take your place in the stream of sordid, money-making men, by whom your prettiest womanly attire would be at such a time quitepnperceived. Formerly, women went abroad with a mask on the face, to indicate that business and necessity took them     68     FIFTEEN MNUTTES AROUND NEW YORK. out; let this dress replace the purpose of the mask. But. beware of laying aside your woman's skirt-the cestus of Venus did not contain more charms. This new dress was never invented by a voman-it is a trap laid by insidious man to enable him to throw off his allegiance to the sex he is now bound to court, respect and love; take the advice of a sylph who has known the belles and beaux of all ceuntries.

OH, FOR an Arab's tent, to sit down anywhere, and pack up when one wants a change of location I for to find a house is a Herculean labor, and as one wanders through the maze of brick edifices, one wonders how the people ever got in them,and, above all, how they can ever consent to get out of them. Take up the Sun, the Herald, and Tribune: it would seem you have only to choose. Put down the agent's name; or, stay-let us write to the agent. A pause of two days. Then comes the reply, referring you to such a number, such a street, or such an avenue. Now, the streets and avenues are pretty long ; so, as you don't know the where-abouts of the numbers, you proceed on foot. Here it is, "to be seen from 4 to 6"--it is just twelve I You are two miles from home. Get out of temper with that house ; turn down another street, and ring the first door on which you see a bill. "Can I see the house?' "Certainly." Over it you go, from'back basement to back attic. Wondrous are the sights you see. Viewing a house whilst inhabited by people going to leaver is like seeing the woman you love, in old slippers and curl papers. Still, you divest it in your mind's eye of its objectionable tenants, and think that it will do. You come to a confidential communication with the maid-servant in the hall, and 'ask the terms. Oh, don't imagine you're coming at them so soon as all that. No, no-all you get is an agent's name down in John street, or Nassau. Well-patience and an omnibus take you there.  The office is that of the gentleman--by no means a  house agent, excepting in this case; hates the business, and growls at you before you begin. "What rent?"  "Why, as to rent, he hadn't meant to rent, but to sell ;"--and he resumes his pen, his register and his calculation. "Well-its your- own fault; why didn't you read the paper?"So it is all to de over again. One lady is indis- posed-couldn't see the house to-day. To-morrow, perhaps, or next day. Another party wants to board with you, if you take the house.

"A thing of beauty is a joy forever;" and once spoken into existence by the creative power of the artist, every beautiful object or thought he produces lives eternally to work its beneficent influences on mankind. Those, therefore, who have been mainly instrumental in introducing the Italian Opera into this country, and who, through indescribable sacrifices, losses and disappointments, have persevered steadily in building it up as an established institution among us, deserve our applause and gratitude. Without the slightest intention of being invidious in what we are about to say, it must be admitted, by all who know the history of the Italian Opera in this country, and have watched it from its first trans- plantation to the present hour of its prosperous growth, that, of all who hayve labored in the cause, MAX MAiETZEK is the most efficient and deserving. It is to him, then, the Manager and sole Director of the Italian Opera in this city, and of its interests in the United States, that, with your permission, impatient reader, we will first introduce you. Come then with us into the Opera House. It is a gala night, and the house is what the daily papers so originally and graphically describe as "the fullest and most fashionable of the season." The flash of the gas- lights is reflected from hundreds of white and jewelled bosoms, from dark, sparkling eyes and azure orbs that melt their glances into the soul. A 'osy and perfumed atmosphere, such as is shed alone by the presence of the world of fashion and high breeding, pervades the house and intoxicates the senses like a distilled dream of. rapture. The rust, ling murmurs of whispered voices and the voluptuous sounds of women's silken robes, which always make the heart beat with a tumultuous and passionate sensation, are'gradnally stilled one by one. The lank and frightfully mustachoed members of the orchestra emerge from their underground and gnome-like retreat beneath the stage, and fall into their places at the little desks against which lean the huge misshapen monsters from whose throats the blatant overture is soon to be evoked. A moment of dead silence supervenes, and a handsome, bright-faced man, who insensibly makes you feel as if you were basking in the warm  sunshine, appears, like an embodiment of Apbllo himself. Gracefully and with a certain dignity which art imparts to all its disciples, he makes his way through the crouching musicians, and assumes his place on an elevated seat in the centre and directly in front of the green umbrella, behind which Italian prompters' traditionally are ensoonced-- though how in the name of all the Ravels they find room there for the coiling up and due functionality of their proportions, has ever. been to us the profoundest of Sphynx's mysteries, and so remains even to the present day. That is Max Maretzek, or, as the critics of New York are fond of styling him, Napoleon Maretzek; and truly such he is and has proved himself in many a hard-fought field, waving his truncheon high above the fierce conflict of trombones and hauthoys, violins and prima donnew and carrying off the honors amid showers of bouquets 'that flew like spent cannon balls, harmless about his head. Everything is ready; a couple of faint taps with the baton on the lit. tie tin candlestick announces that the grand cannonading of the brass pieces and other istruments of modern operatic warfare is about to   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         73 :begin. .igh in air for a moment the fatal baton is held suspended, while the eye of every soldier in the grand orchestral army is intently- fixed upon its jeweled point, ready to blow his brains out at its first descending motion. Crash, clang, clatter I Away they go-the first violin in hot pursuit of the trombones, like a pack of hounds after a yell- ing deer (though we don't know as deers do yell; but it is no matter- for our purpose they must yell.) The Clarionet gives a tremendous snort, and starts off pell-mell after the Flute, which whistles a loud de- fiance as it flies. The fat Fagotto grunts and waddles after, and the gigantic Contra-basso, with its arms raised high in air, growling defiance against the field, stalks majestically and solemnly over the course. The Bass-drum rolls out spasmodic fits of rage and excitement, and the Gong  clatters and clashes along, a very musical locomotive, set in motion by some superhuman laboratory of invincible steam. Calm and serene amid the operatic tempest, which his wand has invoked, stands the implaca- ble magician, guiding the storm to most harmonious measure and melodious issue. Gradually the excitement of the race increases, and all united mingle in the fray. In the terrible din that attends the last grand crash of the-hard hunted overture, it is, impossible to distinguish exactly who arrives first. But it is enough that the harassed creature yields gracefully to his fate, and that all are fairly in -at the death. Then, acknowledging the applause of the delighted spectators with a graceful gesture and a half bow, the leader of the fray reverses his magic wand- and up goes the curtain. Now begins the serious part of the duties of an operatic generalissi- mo in the hour of engagement. The inanimate flutes and fiddles of the orchestra, and the scarcely less mechanical Dutchmen who now blow. and scrape them, it is comparatively an easy task to guide and direct; but to manage the singers is a'far more delicate matter. To play the ,midwife to a prima donna big with a cadenza, and see her safely deliv- ,ered of a squalling cavatina ; to watch a bellowing baritone through the struggling agonies of the utterance of that musical sea, in which he threatens every moment to drown himself; to attemper the intonations f tihe orchestra, and the momentum of the rhythm, to the halting ad  libitum of the primo tenore; to caulk the vents that time has made in the vocal graniture of the basso cantante; and to cover up defects which a want of time renders but too apparent in the chorus-these are tasks which require more than the genius, the skill, the patience, and the indom- itable perseverance of a'mere military conqueror, and which Napoleon himself, in the height of his glory, could never have accomplished. But -Max-our Max-why, \t is nothing but childs' play to him. Minerva at the prow of Telemachus' frail bark was not more serene and compos- ed, nor more secure of the issue than he; for he feels within himself the 'conscious presence of that magnetic power over the mind and will of those whom he makes his instruments, which nothing but genius imparts, and nothing short of genius can merit. He counts not the time by bars or phrases, and sustains not the flagging intonations by mere force of mechanical tone; but heqinfuses his will into the performance and per- formers, and all move and undulate with the harmonious pulsation of his own brain. Seriously, without exaggeration, the office of operatic conductor     74     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROU-ND NEW'YORK. requires a rare combination of high powers and faculties, both mental and moral. -A mere mechanical knowledge of music, no matter how complete, is by no means sufficient to enable its possessor to conduct properly the works of the great masters of the lyric drama. Not only a thorough knowledge of composition, but no inconsiderable degree of absolute talent, is requisite to enable the' conductor thoroughly to feel and understand the very sentiment of the author, and to impart that confidence, precision and unity to the orchestral and choral departments, absolutely necessary to produce the true effect of operatic representation. The opera is a series of pictures painted with sound-a sort of musical panorama, in which the effect of music, as an'art, is intensified and infi- nitely heightened by being united to sentiment, passion, situation and plot. Therefore, none but one who is himself an artist, and can feel' and understand all the beauties and effects of art, is capable of under- takiing to interpret to the uninitiated world of listeners, "the thoughts that breathe and words that burn," of which music, in common with all forms of art, is intrinsically composed. Mr. Maretzek has shown, by many successful and brilliant composi- tions, which are'already well known to the musical world of this country and Europe, that. he possesses in an eminent degree the' gift of- musica genius and inspiration. Were he not so continually absorbed in the arduous and perplexing duties of theatrical management, it is evident. to' al who are familiar with the productions he has already given to tha: public, that he has it in his power to become one of the first and most eminent' composers of his age. It is the destiny, however, of many men of genius, especially in, this hurrying, hatem-scarem age, to fritter away,' in fragTentary efforts the strength, the mind and the genius which properly husbanded and discreetly expended, would raise them to a high, rank among the creative intellects f their day and generation. The. management of an opera or a theatre may be compared, in this respect, to the tadk of editing a daily newspaper. Many editors of journals in this '  av countrly have xpende are ontinuall exendi in the course of their professional career, mind and genius enough to, have built them the loftiest reputtiobis-b- t which, scattered broadcast' over the 'columns of a newspaper, seen this m6ient and then thrown aside forever, reflect no permanent renown uponithem, and only serve to enable them to meet'the daily and Weily nee ibf a common-pla e and imperfec 'eit eSxfis t e                      I   CHAPTER XXI. NEW YORK GOING IN THE COUINTRY-THE FIRST OF JULY. THE winter of the fashionable world is about to set in, and in preparae tion for its rigors, the dainty creatures who inhabit this fairy realm are repluming themselves in fresh and gay habiliments adapted to the emer- gencies of the approaching season. Already has commenced the annual migration from the brilliant arena of Wilton and gas-lights to the green fields and sunny. landscapes, the breezy beaches and the shady drives, where the listless hours of winter inactivity are to glide by. The gaie- ties and festivities by which the long nights of metropolitan summer have been embellished, and in which so many glorious scenes and emo- tions are embalmed, have ceased, and we are now standing idly in the lull between the two great waves upon whose crests the fashionable world rides to and fro, pendulating from Union Square to the United States, and between carpet flirtations and the sea-duck-tions of New- port. Though solitude and silence reign in the gold and velvet domains of drawing-room and'boudoir, yet in other departments of the fashionable household all is bustle and activity; not the thrilling -occupation of fatigue of enjoyment, but the exhausting and temper-destroying industry of preparation. Oh, who can tell the pains and penalties, the cheapen- ings and chafferings, the discontent, the toil, the anxiety, the heart- straining solicitudes, that attend a fashionable woman in conducting to a triumphant termination the grand labors of getting herself up for the summer campaign? What studyings of styles, what discussions of pat- tens, what coquetting with virgin millinery, what disconsolations of exhausted shelves, what divings into exhaustless bandboxes, what ravagings of ribbons and flummery, go to make up the daily toil and nightly dreams of the fair denizens of the West End, during these two momentous months now gliding so serenely by I In view of the newest color for bareges, the selection of a candidate for the presidency sinks into utter insignificance; and compared with bie momentous question of flounces and cadet waists, the destinies of all Europe deserve no sort of consideration.

Salesmen exhaust themselves in smiles, and pile their costly and gaudy fabrics mountain-high before the gloating eyes of their fastidious customers.     76     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. Seamstresses at nine shillings the week grow pale and hungry, and tlin and stoops-houldered, while by the meagre light of a hungry lamp they embroider with weary fingers the roses of their youth and the flowers of their existence into the robes that are to adorn the dainty hodies and limbs of their aristocratic customers. Husbands and papas implore moderation with tears in their eyes, and laggard pens scribble reluc- tantly away at check books; while young men hold nightly consulta- tions over brandy smashers and billiards 'a t Bassford's, of the best and "fastest" way of scattering the " governor's " allowance. In fine, the whole fashionable world is burning and restless under the incipient fever of preparation that ushers in the annual metropolitan epidemic, which nothing but change of scene and the most exhausting bleeding of the head of the family, vicariously for wife and daughters, can cure or alle- viate.   1i      CHAPTER XX1I. TIE CHEF OF POLICE-A TRUE ROMANCE OF LIE   IN NEW YORK. THERE are far better romances constantly occurring in the records of the police department than any imagined or written by our public novel- ists of society. The best of these, or rather the most interesting, seldom see the light or finc themselves in print. As it is against our principles, however, to publish and repeat the matter of our contemporaries, it is our purpose now and then to edify our readers by some of the most interesting of these police-office romances, the details of which we have gathered, no matter how, but we can;assure the public that we have a perfect right to them and that they are authentic. Of course, we shall disguise the names and localities and attendant circumstances of these cases, so that they cannot lead to a recognition; for our motto is, in respect to the slips and peccadiloes of mankind, "let by-gones be by- gones." Some time ago a very pious, respectable and esteemed deacon of one of our fashionable churches, one of whose functions was to carry round the plate on collection days, observed, for several Sundays im succession, a very blooming and handsome lady who invariably put into the contri- bution plate a five-dollar gold piece, where, amid the smooth dimes and worn-out ninepences by which it was surrounded, it looked like, the- mama and nieces mentioned by Byron, shining like "A guinea and seven shilling pieces*" The handsome lady invaribly, as she deposited her coin in the plate, gave the susceptible deacon a sad and tender glance, (doubtless, of unaffected charity and benevolence,) which went direct to his half frozen old heart and thawed out the flowery memories of sweet sixteen. At length, after this rather expensive process of 'coquetting with the old gentleman's susceptibilities had continued for several Sundays, the lady, as the plate came round, timidly arrested the hand of the deacon and whispered to him that she would 'be glad to consult with him on the affairs of an unfortunate member of " our church" who was in great embarrassment and distress--at the same time slipping her card with her address into his hand. It is the part of a Christian as well as a gentleman to be punctual to one's appointments, especially with the ladies; and it may be supposed that our respectable friend was not behind time in calling upon his fair parishioner.

' Pondering day and night on this sad secret, our worthy Deacon lost his appetite, his flesh, his spirits. He' grew sad, hypocho driac, and at length fell sick and took to his bed. The family physician came and told him at first sight that he was laboring under some great mental excitement, which was all that ailed him." He advised that his patient should immediately make a confidant of some member of his famnily and get the burthen off. his conscience as soon as possi- ble, whatever it might be. The advice was followed, and the old gen-   FIFTEENMNfITES AROUND NEW YORK.         79 tieman, with many a contortion of rage and mortification, at length told the whole story to his son-in-law, who at once undertook to arrange the affair amicably.        ' CallingKupon the very amiable 'and polite Chief Matsell, the son-in- law laid the case before him with perfect candor,'and asked his advice in the premises. The chief told him to call in a few days and he .would see what could be done.,.' eannwhile he set the subordinates'of his office at work upon 'the track of the fashionable Mrs. -  and her equally fashionable husband soon discovered that they were in the habit every night of supping latewith a few friends. This looked bad for their respect- ability, and confirmed the 'hief in his suspicions and his course. Arm- ing himself with the necessary keys, he waited'till the hour at which ther supper was in full headway. and then going to the house, he quietly opened the front door, walked up stairs. and entered the; front room where' the party were assembled round the supper table. Casting a trapid police6officeglance round the room, he was somewhat taken aback .; by failing to" ,cognise a single person. However, putting a good face on the matter'iind trusting to luck and' a good cause, he proceeded: "Good eveming, ladies and gentlemen!" said the Chief, "I am Ial' d to see you." "Who the -- are you," exclaimed the, master of the house,. jUmp- ing from (e ,table, while the other guests gave signs of great excite- ment.  "Oh it's all right," said the Chief; "Matsell, the Chief of Police; you know me., All right, go ahead." The announcement of this magic name created the utmost consterna- tion among the party, the members of which, each on his or her own hook, began making tracks for the door.- Quietly locking it, however, with his own key, which he deposited in his pocket, the Chief smiled benignantly upon the-company, and approaching the table, helped him- self to a glass of wine, which he drank to the very good health of the ladies and gentlemen present. At this moment he caught the eye of the mistress of the house-a vague reminiscence came over him of hav- ing seen her somewhere and at some time; when and where, however, he could not for the life of him remember. "Nice supper you have here, madam," continued the Chief, looking round the table. "Ham, boned Turkey, champagne, pie--let us see, difting up the cover,) pigeon pie, dove--um." i "For God's sake, Mr. Matsell," said the woman, "don't; come with me in the next room; I'll own up-it ain't any use--I see you know me." "No, madam," said the Chief, "I really have not that honor, although I confess, I should like to be better acquainted with you." "Why, haven't you just mentioned my name," said she, "in talking about that pie7?" A  light broke upon the Chief-pigeon, dove, thought he- Ah   my dear Mary--Mary Dove; -how do you do?   tow you have altered!" Mary owned up, as she had promised. She said that she had recently' come on to the city to meet her husband, who had just served out a     80     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. five years' term in the State Prison, and that they had put up this:game betweer them, making use for their purpose of the "swag" which he had "planted?" before he had got his sentence. She said it had already cost them pretty smartly, and if he would only let them off this time, they would take themselves out of town. It se ms that Mary Dove was a Scotch girl, who had emigrated-to this country several years before, and had been in good circumstances. She was, however, afflicted with the propensity to steal, merely for the sake of stealing--a propensity more common among women than is gen- erally supposed. Having been detected in several gross thefts, she had lost her position, friends and reputation, and had gradually been driven to a life of license and of crime. The result of this discovery and of the case we have been narrating, need not be told in detail; it is sufficient to assure our readers that the Deacon was speedily restored to health; that the great house of -- & Co. is as flourishing as ever,-and that the worthy head of the estab- lishment may be seen every Sunday at his accustomed duty of carrying the plate round among the benevolent members of " our church." But. if he ever sees a gold piece deposited among the change, or receives a. more than usually expressive glance from a pair of black eyes, he may be observed to turn pale and tremble, and to hasten away from that pew as if he had seen a rattlesnake coiled up on the velvet cushion, or the Father of Evil himself peeping out from behind a prayer bdok. I   CHAPTER XXIII. THE PRESS AND A PUBlLIC DINNER OF AM* the exciting and irritating periods of life, (might have written the great Doctor Johnson, had he been so dispoged,") perhaps the quarter of an hour before the ringing of the bell, is the most unmiti- gatedly tantalizing and provoking. We are among those unfortunate people who, in constant dread of sharing the fate of the truly unfort- nate- Mr. Daniel Tucker, who was too late to come to supper, are always from a quarter to a half hour too early. Are we'to visit Philadelphia or Syracuse, to attend the National Old Fogy Convention, we are sure to be at the depot, or on board the boat a full quarter of an hour before the bell rings, with ample opportunities for making out observations upon the men, women and things that come tumbling in up to the instant of starting.  But it is not of railroads and steamboats we are now to speak; the "quarter of an hour before the bell rings" with which we are inspired, is that which intervenes before the sitting down to a public dinner. Of course the press have all been invited, and all are, or will be present-at least, such as are in the habit of eating and drinking their way into the columns of each others' papers. Many notabilities (and celebrities are also to be present-here and there, perhaps, an alder- man has found his way in-and there is any quantity of generals, colonels, judges, etc., etc. Notwithstanding that 'Mr. Sandford came a great democratic dodge in going to Louis Napoleon's fete in plain black coat and trowsers, where, as the witty Turkish Ambassador said to him, he looked like a black crow among a flock of golden birds-notwith- standing the ultra-democratic pow-wow in which our press and people have indulged on this and all other possible and impossible occasions-- we will undertake to turn out a greater number of colonels,' majors generals, ald titled abilities of all sorts, than can be done in any other city oi the globe. A public dinner is especially a point where all these distinguished characters . congregate-and we have here a fine oppor- tunity of seeing and studying the masculine side of American "disti- guished society." Early as we are, there are those who have been beforehand with us; young reporters, just hatched, who are let out of the paste-room on a trial trip to a public dinner-awkward ensigns of new-fledged target companies, who have got in as substitutes on some editor's ticket who couldn't come-young ward politiciansnot yet Presidents or Governors, but who counideatly expect to be-here and there, perhaps, a hen-pecked. 6     82     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. divine, glad to escape an evening at home, on the pretence of attending a sick brother-or a maudlin poet, out of elbows and a boarding-house, who has begged the invitation of some editor upon whose readers he inflicts his capital-lettered platitudes-the Honorable Mr. Fitzdumpling, member of Congress elect from the forty-seventh district-these, hungry and shark-like, have been for an hour past hanging around the drawing- rooms, and watphing with eager eyes the movements of the waiters gliding in anq out of the dining-room. Yonder on a sofa in the corner, sits a dark, mysterious-looking man -philosophic yet ravenous, self-possessed yet sternly anxious: This is the gentleman upon whom devolves the responsibility of speaking, on all occasions, for the press. He is sometimes overwhelmed with the onerous and somewhat incongruous duties of his position. Some- times he does not sleep at all for several nights previous to some grand public occasion-though we never heard that his appetite was seriously - affected' It will, of course, be readily understood that such intense solicitude must create a corresponding thirst, which longs to assuage itself in oceans of champagne, (young Charles Heidseick, of course- cduldn't think of touching any other brand)-or in inducing oblivion of its fires in torrents of Burgundy. At the present moment, his capacious stomach and expansive nature are equally divided between a prophetic craving after the good things to go into his mouth, and a study of the g6od things which are expected to come out of it.  About this time there is a batch of new arrivals-regular, experienced, veteran dinner-eater, who, without putting themselves into an excite- ment, always manage to be just in time, and a few minutes to spare- that. may completely establish that severe tranquility so necessary to the proper enjoyment of a good dinner. These are men, who, either from parsimony or limited income, maintain an excessively modest cui- sine at home, and who depend entirely upon public dinners, trial trips of steamboats, railroad excursions, "feeds" at the trade-sale, &c., fcr the gratification of their gormandizing propensities. The great object of these persons is to become acquainted with an editor-any editor, any how, so that he is an editor. Then they toady him to the top of his bent-call him a modern Franklin, and predict for hjs journal a suc- cess far exceeding anything ever before heard of. All this is for the purpose of borrowing his tickets and invitations to dinners, concerts, &c., &c. To obtain thesKfavors, many people will spend more time and trouble than would be necessary to earn twice the money the tickets would cost. But then, there is something indescribably fascinating in going free-it makes one for the moment, febl quite like an emperor--' or an editor-which, we take it, is very much the name thing I - But the wives and daughter of these habitual diners-out-these watch- ers of other people's soup-ladles-must, of course, be horribly neglected --poor things! Poor things, indeed I If you had been in Broadway, yesterday afternoon, you might have seen a lady in a light-blue silk dress, covered with flounces which swept the unswept sidewalk, and a bon- net that costforty dollars at Madame Lawson's. A sixty dollar embroider- ed crape shawl was pinned to the cotton breastworks that defend the w e- V'?az de frize of her pointed shoulders-costly bracelets clasped her atte- nuated arms, and a diamond ring glittered otide of her white kid glore.   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         83' By her side was a small copy of herself, with even a more gaudy bonnet, a brighter dress (except that it only came to the knees,) and with a still more affected, bold and mincing gait than her mama. These were the wife and daughter of a prominent diner-out. The lady and daughter, after the fatigues of Jullien, the night before, had slept till ten, leaving papa and the breakfast to the tender mercies of an Irish cook, who, seeing the little respect in which the master of the house was held by its mistress, thought it was unnecessary to waste the nice fresh cutlets upon him, and so sent up the cold remains of yesterday's dinner, and ate ' the cutlets herself. These "high-flying" ladies had been shopping and exhibiting themselves (that's the word,) iniBroadway all the morning, and were on their way to Taylor's, for a woodcock and sherry cobbler apiece. After these slight refreshments were discussed, they prome- naded a little longer in Broadway-and then went home to dress for the evening-assuring papa, when he came home to dinner, that they really had no appetite and shouldn't dine, but they dare say he would find something nice in the kitchen. And that was the last he saw or heard of them until midnight-they both having gone to Ole Bull's con- cert with a young gentleman, a "friend of the family," who afterwards took them to Taylor's for an ice cream and more sherry cobblers. Can you wonder that the exemplary husband and father likes to dine out, and takes every opportunity he can to escape from home? But the dinner hour is at last approaching. The guests begin to thicken, and cluster about in frequent knots and groups, approaching and repelling each other very much in the manner described by Swe- denborg as taking place in the spiritual world. These last five minutes of most intense expectation are devoted to that instinctive classification and arrangement of the guests among themselves, which always takes place among regular diners-out. And now the important moment arrives. A dead pause, resembling the calm before the breaking out of the battle, pervades the drawing-  room! every hand, eye and tongue seems as if it had suddenly been arrested, "As by the stroko of the enohanter's wand." An expression of intense expectation is transfixed on every face, and every eye points rigidly as a pointers tail, to one certain door. The shining knob is evidently magnetised by the regards of so many powerful intellects concentrated upon it. It begins to move---it turns -the door opens-the smiling face of the host appears--he advances  "Gentlemen will you have the kindness to walk in to dinner?" Now begins the scramble-not the mere vulgar scramble for plates and places, which takes place at an " ordinary" dinner, where the only object is to get as near as possible to a great number of promising dishes, and to see that you have a small and feeble man on either side  of you, so that your arms and elbows may have full sway, without poking the ribs of anybody whose ire would be dangerous. The conten- tion on the present occasion is one of mock-modesty, every "distin- guished gentleman" present, of course wishing to make himself still more distinguished, by ignoring the fact of his existence, and being with     84    FilTSEN MNUTE   AROUND NEW YORK. difficulty persuaded that he-is anybody at all. In the melee, the adroit, the courageous, the best assured, and frequently the least meritorious, mantge to step into the best places, and to take the lead in eterything that follows. For ourselves, content that we have at length found an obscure seat at the bottom of the table, we go to work minding our own business, and in no way interfering with our neighbors \      \/   CHAPTER XXIV. THB NEW   YeRK  CUSTOM  HOUSB. HAVE you a package of goods to be exhibited at the Crystal Palace, andcan't you get them through the Custom Itouse? Let us go down and see about it. But first, as you are in no particular hurry-foreign- ers are never in a hurry in America--we will stop and take a look at things in this great white marble temple of customs and money-chan- gers. Of course, entering by the Pine street door, we stop to buy a peach of the immortally youthful Sarah, Mary, Catharine, or'whatever her name may be, who, through every political storm, and every change of administration, always keeps her place and her complexion. No one ever dares think of removing her, she is,as firm in her " place," as the clock of the Rotunda. Her cakes and peaches are always fresh-and so is the. red of her cheeks. Slanderers have asserted that they are both renewed every day-but this we potently disbelieve. She is always making up a gunny-bag into a petticoat, and the same gunny-bag, the same smile, and the same cheeks, greet you day after day, year after year, and collector after collector. Administrations change-collectors, and deputies, and naval officers, and inspectors, go out and come in, but she is always the same-her rouge and gunny-bag are perennial. In national politics, her position is with the North-being situated on the north side of the building-but she treats North and South alike, and has been even known to sell a rank woolly-head one:of her best and freshest peaches. She is on familiar terms with all the celebrities, the magnates, the hangers-on, and lazzaroni, of the Custom House. She knows at a glance, whose salary has been mortgaged to his land- lady and washerwoman, and who has no salary at all-whose stomach glows with well-fed contentment, and whose heart is torn with wretch- edness and despair, waiting for official promises from within the sanctum sauctorum of the temple, made to be broken. Surely you can afford to buy a peach, to conciliate this gentle Cerberus?-and besides, your pen- ny will be well spent, for the peaches are really delicious. Never mind the dark caves and dungeons below stairs,-they are all alike-nothing but stone walls, mahogany desks, smoky atmosphere, and a parcel of idle men lolling in arm chairs, talking politics, and smoking capital cigarp, which have been presented to them as "samples" by. shrewd importers, who know what you don't-how to get goods through the Custom House in a hurry. We will also leave, for the' present, the long ranges of offices below and above, on either side of the hall we are traversing. They are devoted to the silent, serious, business of book-keeping, in its hard-Working and unostentatious forms. Each apartment is appropriated to some distinct branch of the innumerable     86     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. entries, which form the immense, and probably more than half useless, machinery of modern importation. Let us pass into the Rotunda, through these double-jointed, smoothly. swinging doors, that open with the pressure of a finger, and close behind you like a severed wave. So far as convenience and comfort are concerned, the Custom House is certainly ahead of any other public establishment in the world. In winter it is kept at a constantly equal temperature, night and day, by innumerable pipes of hot water running all through the building. In summer it is as nearly ventilated as any building in this age of foul air, is permitted to be. Our builders and house planners (they can scarcely be called architects) have made admi- rable provision in our houses for water, light, and warmth-but the ele- ment of fresh air has apparently altogether escaped their attention. What between the want of ventilation, and the absence of convenient means of egress, it is a perpetual wonder to us, how people get alive out of any of our public buildings. But this is en passant. So far as our observations go, people who once get into the Custom House don't seem in a hurry to get out--in fact, don't like to go out at all-the atmosphere evidently agrees with them I In fact, they consider it quite a calamity when they are obliged to go out, now and then, to make room for new comers. It is now twelve o'clock, and the Custom House is in full activity in all its departments. The deputies and clerks do not arrive till ten, and from eleven to three is the busy season.. Seated at their desks on a large platform, (probably composed of the fragments of the Buffalo, Syracuse, Baltimore, and other platforms, of which one hears so much and sees nothing,) are the four Deputy Collectors-the most conspicu- ous and important objects in the Rotunda. Each desk is garnished with its eue, reaching to the Wall street door, of thin, spicily-dressed, tobacco-chewing young clerks, mixed up with bluff sea captains and muscular mates-with here and there a perspiring old fogy, to give weight and character to the procession. The deputies perform mira- cles of despatch in reading (?) and signing manifests, certificates, bills of lading, and what not-administering to each customer in turn, the following oath, in a hurry: "You solemnly swear .. '** * ' elp you God!" Passing through the Rotunda,'as if we were-going to descend into Wall street down the southern steps, (a thing whic' nobody, by any chance, ever does,) let us disappear through this tall doorway, which glides as noiselessly as all the others, and we shall find ourselves in the august presence of the Collector himself, who sits like a spider in his den, weaving his patient meshes, and ready to dart on any rash, intrud- ing fly. He receives us with a frown, because the pesterings of thee' horde off oice-seekers keep him in a continual ill-humor. As soon, how- ever, as he sees that we do not belong to that pestiferous class, his face instantly relaxes, and he points to a chair, with all the suavity of a finished gentleman. The Collector's Assistant, "Pious Mose," who pretends to an unusual degree of sanctimoniousness, is suspected to be a sort of Olivier le Dais, who is not always so immaculate as he would   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         87 appear. However, no doubt he is quite as honest as the subordinates ranged along the entry desks-who, though they knock off work punc- tually at 3 o'clock, still manage to take papers home with them, and despatch the business of those who know how to extract from them these arduous extra services. Of the general divisions and departments of the Custom House, we shall speak very briefly, as everybody interested is supposed to know all about them. As you enter from Pine street, on your. right hand are the apartments, of the Naval Office, and opposite, those of the Sub- Treasury, where, in a small, dark corner, stands Uncle Sam's safe, with some six or eight millions of gold. Up stairs, over the Naval Office, is the Auditor's Office, and opposite, that of the Surveyor-our beloved shoft-shelled friend and old Oswego acquaintance, John Cochrane-at one of whose desks sits perched our handsome whilom' editorial brother, Spencer Cone-now an inverted cone, subserving the purpose of bal- ancing a set of books for the people, instead of writing them. Down stairs, in the dungeons we spoke of, are the weighers, guagers, and measurers-a set of the most harmless and intense old fogies in existence. Many of them have occupiedl'rominent and influential positions in the community, and, having become unfortunate, hate accepted a situation here, as a sort of Chiltern Hundreds. Yonder is as old gentleman, formerly capitalist of the firm of Joseph & Co., which. made such a tremendous smash-up some years ago. He looks calm and contented-smokes his pipe in peace, and no doubt is far happier than he ever was in the hey-day of his prosperity. The failure of his house was as sudden as an Italian thunder-storm. He had just purchased a pair of magnificent carriage-horses for $1500, whi6h were driven to the door in the morning for the first time-in the evening of the same day he was a bankrupt for millions. He now has become a permanent inmate of that asylum for the destitute-the Custom House.  We said nobody ever passed down the southern steps. This is almost literally true. Americans are the chariest people in the world, of their steps; and every man who has to visit the Custom House, manages to take it on his return from the Post Office, so as to enter in Pine street, level with the ground. Thus the south steps would be comparatively unappropriated, were it not for the kindness of those peripatetic dealers in puppies and carving-knives, toothache drops and Shanghai fowls, who make it their general rendezvous and point' of departure, and whose'incongruous collection df wares and merchandize form one of the most characteristic features of the street. We will not leave the Custom House without whispering a word of advice to strangers and out-siders, who wish to have, their business here transacted expeditiously-employ a Custom House broker. He will charge you only two dollars for the job-and may save you sever valuable days.     CHAPTER XXV. A FASHONABLE GAMBLING)  HOUSE-AN HOfUR AT PAT HEARN'S NOTHNG in New York undergoes more marked and charactesistic changes, at the different seasons of the year, than the gambling-houses. The summer is their dulfleason. The regular sporting men, from whom the most substantial poqtion of their custom is drawn, have gone to the Springs, or to Newport, to practice upon the pockets and passions of the green and ennuyees sojourners there. People who have nothing to employ themselves with but their wives and bathing dresses, are glad of anything to distract their attention, or keep them alive. Saratoga, Niewport, the Blue Sulphur, &c., &e., are the harvest-fields of the gam- blers. In the early part of summer, one by one drops off and is missed from his accustomed haunts, until the fashionable gambling saloons are deserted, and the billiard rooms and coffee houses, where they are wont to spend their mornings, see them no more. By a kind of tacit under- standing, the ground is laid out amongst them, so that they shall not cross each other too frequently, nor appear in too large bodies. Certain places become the hereditary possession, as it were, of certain paries- like the Pigeon Roost, adjoining the United States Hotel, at. Saratoga, where, year after year, the J--ses of Albany, Lord G-- G--  n, and their set, regularly spent the mornings in fleecing such strangers as could be roped in, or in case of no outside victims, in plucking one another. At dinner, and in the evening, they condescend to appear, and were of course (as all scapegraces, libertines, villians and well-dressed vagabonds universally are,) lionized by the ladies, and took the lead in all the sports and amusements of the ultra fashionable and ultra moral people, who take the Tribune, and refuse to go to a theatre, for fear of moral contamination. After the suppers, dancing and flirtations of the drawing-rooms were over, and the ladies had retired to their virtuous couches, (very ricketty and bed-buggy little wooden bedsteads,) our young gentlemen resumed the regular occupation of their lives, and cut and shuffled, and passed buttons, till late into the night. Meanwhile, the establishments iln town were deserted. At last the principals themselves left, confiding the small, shabby, summer business to some trusted dealer or silent partner, who suddenly made his appear- ance from Philadelphia or some 6ther out-of-the-way-place. Thus, in summer, the fashionable gambling houses are not particularly interesting. Pat Hearn, who is the most gentlemanly man that ever   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YOBRK         '8 drank champagne or cut a pack, spent the summer at the Springe of course; and "C1bve" and his assistants, after lounging about all day, would gather round the tables in the spacious drawing-rooms in Broad- way, where the tiger lay as docile as a lamb-the splendid feed, now greatly reduced from its magnificent winter proportions, standing almost untouched and the bright and mischievous champagne devil pining in- gloriously in his bottle. Now and then a solitary straggler wpuld find his way in, but, seeing how dreary and melancholy everything appeared, (for there is no Peter-Funking in a first-class establishment like Pat's,) would take a drop of brandy and water, and retire. Frequently, for nights in succession dLring the summer, the cards are not dealt; and when they are, it is some "picayune game," at which everybody turns up his nose, except the greenhorn, who thinks is making a grand "splurge" by losing five dollars' worth of buttons, and goes off feeling quite grand at having come the fashionable swell soloud. "Cleve" sits in the back parlor, lolling back in a roclkng-chair smoking a choice segar, and poking his feet through the thick vines that climb about the window. But this season of inactivity is now about closing. The summer of metropolitan life has set in-and nowhere are its effects more percep- tible than in the fashionable gambling-house. The fast young men, who spend papa's money as magnificently as if it had. not been made by sell- ing sausages or speculating in slops, are again showing their miraculous trowsers and their still more miraculous legs, in Broadway. The nights are getting cool and pleasant, and the days not too long. Oysters are in their glory, and woodcock and other still more dainty game can be "had " for money. Madame ---   has opened her fall fripperies from France, and all the penny-a-liners out of situation, are making arrange- ments to start new papers which shall give the world an idea of what a journal should be. Let us call, therefore, with the rest of the fashion- able world, and pay our respects to the most respectable of gamblers, Pat Hearn. He was once refused admission to a quasi theatre-where, from the want of a third tier, virtuous women and their children are turned in side by side with the fancy women, rakes and bloods of the town, and listen, well pleased, to balderdash which would inexpressibly shock them if proceeding from the stage of a "regular" theatre. We ring, and the door is opened by a well-bred, well-dressed negro, who politely inquires our business. Seeing you in company, however, with a person he knows, he invites you to walk in. Had you been alone, and a stranger, he would, have called out the master of the house, who would have inspected you, and, of course, admitted you, as you parry entleman upon your face. We deposit our hats and canes in the hall, regulation not, however, strictly insisted on,) and enter the front drawing-room, where a supper table, covered with very handsome dishes and bountifully supplied with crystal, stands always ready. It is still early, and the habitues of the house have not come in from the theatre, billiard-rooms, bar-rooms, oyster cellars, &c., &c., where they have been picking up recruits. After being introduced to the proprietor, he invites you to take some supper, and upon your declining, presses you to at least do him the honor of taking a glass of .wine with him, and hopes that     90    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND. NEW YORK. you will find your appetite later in the evening. A gesture brings the faithful and silent waiter, who understands everything by a look from the master of the house, which says: "Here are a couple of gentlemen whom I wish to treat with especial civility. Bring a bottle of the very best champagne, and plenty of ice." "No ice for me, if you please." "Oh, you don't take ice? You are not an American. We consume an iceberg a minute in New York.

The habit of dropping great chunks of ice into wine is an infatuation-it destroys the flavor, and converts the choicest nectar into slops." "Sir, you are a philosopher." "I have learned how to live--as to dying, we arrive there without educating ourselves for it. But will you walk into the other room? By this time the company begins to collect, and the faro table is set. The game in its mere mechanical details, has been too often described for me to describe it, (as Shelly doubtless would have written). Every- thing goes on with the greatest order and quiet. --The old gentleman with his miniature table and remembering machine before him, watches the game closely, without moving a muscle or changing a hue, while the players and lookers-on eagerly watch him and make their calcula- tions. To the uninitiated nothing is so blind a riddle as even t1e sim- plest game of chance. The most intelligent man in the world might. watch the game of faro for ten years, and, without an explanation, would know nothing whatever about it. He would see a man seated at one end of a long table upon which a whole pack of cards were fas- tened, each by its back to the cloth, very busy in taking other cards out of a tin soda-powder b6x and carefully laying them down in two neat piles beside his box. By his side sits a man, with large piles of red and white ivory buttons before him, which he sells to the people standing about the table, at very dear rates-a dollar a piece for the white ones, and five dollars for the red. These buttons are distributed about'on various cards, by the button-holders; and at every second card he lays down, the dealer gathers them up from some parts of the table and'adds them to those at his side-while in other places he lays down from his own pile as many as the player had put down. It must be remembered that, as a general thing, he takes up much oftener than he puts down,- and that, if you watch closely, you will see a regular stream of bank bills passing up to the man at his side, while his piles of buttons con- stantly grow smaller, but never get exhausted,-for they all eventually come back to him, and he sells them over again to those maddest of all madmen, each of whom, knowing that the chances are infallibly such as to rin him, yet thinks that he alone, of all the world, has discovered a process for cheating the laws of numbers, and giving mathematics the lie. Scenes of intense interest and excitement perpetually occur here. The gambling-house is the cockpit of the passions, where the fight goes on perpetually for victory or death. Gambling is the mots serioas.

Every man who has duties he would per- form, obligations he would fulfil, affections he would indulge, or loved ones he would make happy, should shun the gambling-house as-he would the path that leads to moral, social, and spiritual hell.       I 1     CHAPTER XXVI. JULLIEN AT CASTLB QARDBN. OCu musical experiences would not be complete without a visit to Jullien. He was only in his glory at Castle Garden-the atmosphere of Metropolitan Hall did not agree with him. But, at Castle Garden, he was a veritable enchanter. Have you ever witnessed one of those wondrous, incomprehensible, holiday spectacles, where a handsome fairy appears, amid beautiful nymphs springing out of a fountain, who sends the hero of the piece scampering through the world in search of some magic rose, or harp, or sword, as the case may be-seen them brought at last into some horrid, dingy cave, with heavy chains and noisome, damp-eaten walls? Have you not then wondered how they were to get out, and how the magic article in demand is to be found- when, suddenly, the aforesaid fairy, entering bang through the solid wall, makes a speech, joins the lovers, and displays the talisman; then, with a wave of the star-tipped wand, the old cave vanishes up through the ceiling, down through the traps-every way it vanishes-and in its place stands the palace, (of happiness, or fame, or immortality, or what- ever the case may be,) all flowers, and gauze, and gilding, and light, and precious stones? Well, so it was with Castle Garden I Dirty old Castle Gafden-who could have known you? The magic baton of the great Jullien had transmogrified you completely. In white and gold shone your walls; your columns, wreathed in flowers, gar- lands round your galleries, and banners waving from your ceiling'; tro- phies of arms surrounded by waving gossamer draperies, relieved the monotony of the floral devices; and in the Orchestra, enlarged down to those first columns that always came between you and Salvi, or Sontag, or Steffanone, in their grandest moment, now rose the throne of the giver of the feast-a throne, a perfect throne, a crimson and gold arm- chair, on a crimson and gold carpet, and before it a golden music stand. An Orchestra so good that a mere common chord, given by its full and complete band, is delicious; then solos of various instruments, from artists sufficient each in himself to draw a crowd, and a conductor such as there never was, will be, or is. This is what is to be seen and heard at our renovated abode of sweet sounds. Jullien was wonderful. The living programme of each forthcoming bar, he stood aloft in that vast expanse of shirt and that creaseless bow of a cravat, acting out in gestures the sentimental, the heroic, the intri- cate and the tripping measures of the orchestra above, beneath, around. A pianissimo shriveled him all up into nothing-whilst a fortissimo stretched and expanded him into a giant. The roll of the drums lifted him off his feet; and the trumpts wafted him to the skies. Conduct-   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         93 ing is his vocation; he conducts as if he played each individual instru ment; and so does he love conducting, that even when subsided into his arm-chair, while Bottesini and Reichert were playing their solos to the hushed and wrapped audience, he did a sly little bit of conducting all to himself, behind their backs-beating, waving, wriggling, that immortal baton which never was so waved before. Comparatively, we like not the real, classical, expressive music by this orchestra. It is like a bad translation-it gives the outline of the story, but none of the finesse of language or detail. But the dancing music i beyond all praise. In fact, Jullien will do. He is the man for the masses; and when taking from its hiding-place the diamond-headed baton given him by his friends, he commanded his army to play Hail Columbia and Yankee Doodle, he forever ensconced himself in the hearts of the public. Jullien has developed musical taste-that is, a taste for musical sounds-in England, which will lead in time to an appreciation of a higher class of music. His concerts are one of the most rational, agreeable, and delightful of pastimes, and will probably-require no puffing, to be fully successful. Then the really great artists whose genius stands out from this musical back-ground, give an intense irte- rest which will draw educated musicians to his Concerts. Reichert is the ideal of flute-playing-soft, clear, brilliant; teeming with intricate difficulties, yet never boisterous, but ever even, like the flow of some gentle brook. Bottesini, who was welcomed as an old favorite, with cheers and waving of handerchiefs, 'is what we all remem- ber him. He seemed to draw, from within that large monster he han- dles so delicately, the very essence of Alboni's voice. Now that we hear Bottesini again, we remember that it was of his heart-searching, thrilling sounds, that matchless voice so often reminded us. Mad'lle Anna Zerr-a plain, thin, ungraceful German, not over- young-has giyen us little but her far-famed song from the "Plauto Magico," doing no end of E's in altissimo. With a wiry voice and numerous grimaces, her singing is like the perpetual tuning of the last half-octave of those monstrous seven and a half octave pianos. Those who like that operation, will like Anna Zerr's singing-none else.      . "     !  *         i*  . : o, .-    C HAPTER XXVII. P PLIAS  RE S  OF  HOTEL   LIF E. AN acquaintance of ours, from Mississippi-a prosperous planter, surrounded, when at home, with everything to make him comfortable and contented-has been for some weeks, with his daughter, sojourning in New York, for the purpose of seeing a little of life in the metropolis, and laying in a stock of souvenirs for the winter. Of course they could live nowhere but at a fashionable Broadway hotel, and so there they are. A glance at the way they live will furnish a striking and not uninstructive illustration of the extravagant inconveniences to which our hotel life subjects its victims. The gentleman himself has no room at all-he sleeps in his clothes, on a mattress laid down in one of the parlors, and washes, shaves and dresses where and how he can. If he happens to be in time for the grand rush at dinner, he perhaps gets something to eat-and perhaps  he don't. At all events, he spends a dollar or two a day for edibles, +&c., down town. The young lady has no room to herself, but occupies a room in common with two other ladies, and of course must find the scramble far more inconvenient than does her father. For these accom- ,modations, however, our friend pays five dollars a day, without " extras," which count up pretty fast, I can tell you. Some. hundred customers of this same hotel, after recording their names in the register lying on Ithe marble counter of the-office, and taking a look round the elegantly furnished apartments, are sent off to bedrooms and closets in private houses " over the way," where servants attend them " over the left," and where a perpetual bell-concert is going on, 'to no purpose, and in compari- son with which the Swiss bell-ringers were a total failure. These unfortu- nate convicts may rave and rail in their cells as much as they like- nobody hears or heeds them; and when they make their escape from ! their twenty shillings a day lodgings, they must dive into a barber's shop to be shaved, and into an oyster cellar to get breakfast. Two other friends of ours, stopping at another "first class hotel," have slept in their chairs every night during the present week, and look as if they had just arrived from Australia. We were so unfortunate as to be invited to dine with one of them, a day or two ago. The hour was five-and of course the slow-creeping omnibus, which never got full, although our knees ached with the weight of the plump young lady who did us the honor to ride on our lap, deposited us at the door ten min- utes behind time. Our friend was looking out of the window, and we   FIFTEEN-MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         95 saw in an instant that something doleful had happened. Prepared for the worst, we entered the bar-room, with sad misgivings. "What made you so late?" inquired our friend, with a dismal attempt at concealing the anxiety which was devouring him. "Oh, the confounded omnibuses l-they're always behind-hand. But no matter-we shall do well enough." "Yes, but-you see-the fact is-that-there are no seats at the table, and-we must wait till somebody is done." This was pleasant for a man who was to dine at five, make six calls between dinner and seven o'clock, and be in time for the opera I However, we talked politics, settled Mr. Marcy, and annihilated John Van Buren, and wound up with a drop of Stoughton bitters, (" just to give us an appetite," as our friend unfeelingly remarked,) and'wero at length ushered into the dining-room, where a lady in starched undersleeves was washing grapes in her finger-glass-and took our seats. The waiters, however, who had been, during the early part of the dinner, rehearsing the battle of Marathon-using the dish-covers for shields-were now engaged in assisting at the revolution in China, which precedes the pad- ding. It was, therefore, some time before they condescended to take any notice of the outside barbarians who had dared to interfere with the regular routine of their amusements. Finally, a sentimental gentle- man in love, with a tie to which he had evidently given his whole mind, condescended to stoop daintily between our heads and listen to our confessions of hunger. The soup was out-the fish had followed its example-chickens, ducks and pigeons had disappeared-and the turkey question had been settled and laid away on the sideboard, no longer furnishing even a bone of contention. The only viands remaining were a piece of cold roast mutton, with a dish half filled with coagulated blood, and a plate of cold boiled onions. The ladies had stripped the table of fruit, cakes, &c., carrying away for private mastication in their rooms, what they did not eat at table-and altogether the dinner resulted in our friend proposing an adjournment to a restaurant, where we dined sumptuously off a dirty table-cloth and fatwoodcock. j Now, there isn't a syllable of exaggeration in these instances we have quoted, and they are a fair sample of the overcrowded phase of fashion- able hotel life in New York. Strangers may console themselves, how- ever, with the reflection that there are half a dozen new hotels going up, and that in a few years longer, the whole movement of life and society in New York will be turned out of doors and go on upon the sidewalk.     CHAPTER XXVIII. "Pt  ON A BAiLROAD--SOENES IN     THE TUNNEL. Ai, the railroad tunnels in this country are dark-dark as Erebus-- dark as a pocket in a shirt-dark as an alderman's character-dark as pitch-dark as anything, in short, that is the antithesis of light. In France, where the people are so immoral that the government wouldn't dare to leave them together in a rail-car going through a dark tunnel, all the tunnels are lighted, by lamps hung at the sides of these modem Cyclopean caverns, and which flash their tell-tale rays through the car windows, so that it is impossible to get so much as a squeeze of the hand, clandestinely, from your vis-avis, or your companion, even while going'through the longest tunnel.  We are afraid we are getting as immoral as the naughty French people-and our pious and incorruptible rulers will soon have to adopt. similar precautions to those in the French tunnels, if they would not have our young gentlemen and young ladies who come down from Harlem in the morning trains, to be as bad as-themselves. We have recently witnessed-or rather heard-some curious illustrations of this fact, which, if we could reproduce them here, exactly as they came to our ears, Would make Mrs. Partington, and the worthy tea-party of whom that venerable lady is the venerated head, jump out of their skins with horror. A single instance we will attempt to describe. Two young gentlemen, bound down town to their employers' counting- houses, enter the cars at Harlem, or Mott Haven, or Morrisiana, or no matter where, simultaneously with two young ladies of " sweet sixteen," sathel and portfolio in hand, on their way to Madame 's celebrated young-lady-finishing establishment, in--Place. After the " customary greetings" (as James said in his celebrated novel of the "Two Horse- men"), the young gents select two seats and turn them face to face. The young ladies, with a giggle, intended doubtless as an apology for- not blushing, seat themselves side by side, with the gentlemen opposite -after a great deal of very laughable trouble in getting the knees of the whole party fairly dove-tailed together, and every thing comfortably arranged. Then commences a course of loud conversation and boister- ous laughter, which draws upon, them the attention of all in the car. Prudent mamas scowl and purse their lips; papas shrug their shoul- ders, as much as to say, " thank heaven, they are not nmine!" and bache- lors of all ages open their eyes, nurse their whiskers, and nudge their neighbors with a chuckle. By-and-by, however, everybody subsides again to his newspaper, and our quartotte goes on, crescendo, in noise   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.          97 and laughter. At last here comes the tunnel. "Here we are!" says blue eyes, with a giggle and a very faint imitation of a scream. "Now, Jim," laughs black eyes, " none of your tricks as you did yesterday. There's sky-lights in this tunnel." It now gets very dark; and, as nei- ther of the young gentlemen says a word, we have no means of knowing what is going on. Presently one of the'young ladies-we think, by the voice, it is our blue-eyed blonde-gives a little squeal and a giggle-one of the "sky-lights suddenly lets in a ray of light, and "Jim" starts bolt upright and throws himself against the b ak of his seat, looking i very red, and holding his hat in one hand. Now we are in utter dark- ness again-good gracious ['what is that? Is one' of the' axles break- ing, or have we run on a snake-head? Swyeechxceeppe!

If we must import our morality, let us also impor some of its conveniences and its safegards. e1     CHAPTER XXIXI THE  DOWN TOWN    EATING-HOUSE. 'IT is half-past twelve, and I must be in Wall street at one. We shall have no time to dine." "No time to dine? Absurd. Come with me, and I'll show you where you can dine sumptuously in-a quarter of an hour, and for a quarter of a dollar, if you like. It is just high-tide at the down-town eating-houses." We enter with a rush. You would think there was a political meet- ing going on; but it is something of even more importance than politics. The mnoment we leave the atmosphere of the street, we encounter a hot, moist current, composed of an infinity 'o rank smells, over which that of burnt grease decidedly predominates. Musty lemons, fried fish, onion steaks, and the contents of the slop-tub under the bar, contribute to enrich the preliminary repast of the nose, if they do not have the effect of increasing the appetite. However, we have no time to wasterin a useless analysis of smells.' Besides, if you complain of them here, what do you think of the poor people in the kitchen below stairs, where they make them? What shall we have for dinner? We move on from table to table, looking for a table cloth that doesn't look as if it had done duty in a surgeon's dissecting room. No use- they are getting worse andtworse. Stand not upon the order of your eating, but eat at once. Orhe castor is lame' of a leg, and is troubled with such a stiffness in the neck that it can't turn round. No matter- - there is nothing in it, as the man says in the play. The pepper has sneezed itself out-the mustard isn't on muster-the vinegar has evap- orated, and you catch up the ketchup bottle in vain. Here's a bill of fare: it looks like a scrap of old newspaper in which a schoolboy had wrapped up his dinner. But read fast-the waiter has stood glowering darkly at us for some minutes, and will be off, if we don't hurry. "Pea-soup? Very well. Bring us two plates of pea-soup." "P-soup all gene, sir." "Well--never mind the soup-bring us some boiled salmon." "Ain't got'ny, sir." "Why, here it is on the bill." "Must'a f'got to scratch'tout, sir." "Well, what have you got?" "Ros'beef-ros'mutt'n-ros'pork-and-applesauce, sir," "Well-bring us some of it, if you please!" "Which?"   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         99 Anything at all-only be in a hurry." The knives have not lately been scoured, and are but loosely inserted in black horn handles-so that you are obliged to hold fast by the blade. The fork consists of two very rusty iron prongs, inserted in a similar sort of handle-so that the only chance you have of making any use of it, is to stick it into something. As to the ordinary purpose of carrying food to the mouth, it is quite useless. But that is by no means the ordinary purpose of a fork in this place- as you can easily satisfy yourself by watching the operations of those  around. Every man grasps his knife tightly by the middle of the blade inserts the point, shovel wise, under the mass of beef, potatoes, gravy and tomato-sauce with which his plate is garnished, heaps it up with his fork, and so carries the shovel-full to his mouth, wiping the weapon clean with his lips as he withdraws it. That's the way to eat fast and dine cheap! Isn't it nice, dainty reader? While we are waiting for whatever the good feeling of the waiter, or the voracity of the sovereign people, (who dine in state for eighteen pence,) may have left us, we have two minutes to look about us. There, at the table opposite, is Mr. Winken, the celebrated lawyer of Nasau street. He has been brow-beating a witness all the morning, and has only slipped off 'for a minute to get a snack, while the court is deciding a knotty point as to the admissibility of evidence. The operations of his vast mind have not been disturbed by the interruption. He bullies the bread-plate, cross-questions the castor, and looks at the poor dumb- waiter with that peculiar withering glance, which, in the -- Court, usually portends a commitment for contempt of court. His cut of beef is clearly a tough subject, and after examining it in every possible point of view, he is evidently about abandoning, it as a bad job. He scm- nizes the white overcoat button which the waiter has laid by his plate, as if it were an affidavit-a counter-affidavit, if you will allow, us the pun-from the opposite party. He calls abstractedly for dumpling, and seems to consider it a fair excuse for non-payment of the previous bill, when the waiter tells him it is "out." Having his attention fully aroused, by a look at the clock, he seizes his hat, heavy with papers, which he always carries there as a specimen brick of his gigantic pro.. fessional duties, rushes off, settles his little bill of costs by giving a shilling and a five cent piece instead of eighteen pence, and so escapes into the street. Here is a philanthropist on your left, who professes never to eat meat. He has already despatched half a chicken, and is now putting into a cut of roast pork, as if it were the argument of an adversary. He looks leprous and scrofulous. He has tfeen overworked all his life-his brain has been developed like a hot-house cauliflower or a goose's liver -while all the rest of his nature,.except the mere mental faculties, is as undeveloped and fruitless as the potato-vines that sprout in the cellar and never see the light. He goes days without taking the necessary sustenance; and then, driven by blind animal instinct into the first place where his nose leads him, he gorges upon whatever is set before him, in a sort of hungry insanity. The effect of such -madness is writ- ten in his idiotic face, his boil-encumbered body, his vacant eye and pre-     100    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK maturely wrinkled face-the face of a child grown suddenly sixty. He is the victim of the most melancholy and hopeless kind of dissipation- and: yet he denounces in terms of frenzy, every man who drinks a glass of swine, or sells it to his neighbor. He will not eat again for some days ; and no wonder. He has entrenched himself behind a hecatomb fl bones. Do you see that paralytic, Jewish-looking man behind us? That is one of the mysterious characters who insert thpoe tempting advertisements in the Herald, addressed to all who want money, and offering to make the most liberal advances upon every species of personal property. You are hard up: you want money. You take your watch to our friend. It cost you a hundred dollars: he will buy it for twenty, or lend you fifteeo on its security. As a general thing, these private establishments are much less liberal than the regular pawnbrokers-and then these fel- 1owI may, at any time, run off with your property, and you have no redress. Our friend here, who began business with a hundred and fifty dollais, two -years ago, is already a capitalist. His victims are broken- dbon gamblers, extravagaznt clerks, unfortunatee landladies, foreigners who come to America -t make their fortunes, and sell their clothes to get home agaif---eturned Californi  t ans dot and injured by the climate and other causes,--and last, but by no means least, a certain class of women, who, rich to-day in jewels and rings, strip them off to-morrow, for a few dollars to gratify t lover or a caprice. They seldom reclaim them-and 'o our conscientious friend sees his store increase, and his bank account grow plethoric. But who is that grave, thoughtful-looking man in black whiskers and green spectacles? That is Dr. --, a well-known sporting man. He is an excellent fellow-has a generous nature, and is generllyesteemed strictly honorable: knave, of course, is his profession. Nor does he actually ckeqt even in' that. It is not by cheating that gamblers make their money, so much as'by pfaying upon the passions of their victims. Whatever chances are in the game, the gambler has cooly'studied, and provided against: it is his business. But the casual player gets excited with his losses- mad and furious, if they continue ; he cannot afford to lose'; he :ust make it up! )And so he plays on, and is ruined. In every ordinary relation of life, our friend in the spectacles is as fair, correct, and liberal a man as you can find. He pays his debts; is always ready to help a friend, and is, as you see, very quiet and gen- tlemanly. The " tiger" has sheathed his claws, but don't come too near the cage-there's no knowning what might happen I      ' Here comes our dinner: a slice of pale-looking beef drowned in watery gravy, flanked by a dab of mashed potatoes, mingled with a suspicion of ditto turnips, and a couple of thin outside slices of yester- days bread. Well, never mind, we havn't time to linger, or quarrel with our fare. This is the way in which the business world of New York daily dines-and it manages, you see, somehow to subsist. True, there are various grades of eating-houses-:from Delmonico's, where you pay two or three dollars for an ordinary meal, to Sweeny's, where the last commodity (at least so far as the words go) is served up for sixpence a plate. But we cut,into the first one we encountered and it v             *              (   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         101 may be considered a fair sample of a very large class of these public conveniences. Doubtless, they greatly facilitate the transaction of business, and save an immense amount of time. But it may be seriously questioned whether the men who frequent them do not find all this time taken, in one big slice, from the latter end of their lives; or whether any mere momentary convenience can compensate for the dyspepsia, ill health, and general degeneracy of the race, consequent upon this ter- rible system of gobbling down unchewed and unwholesome food.

He goes slowly enough, blocking up the way, and keeping back all that long row of carriages. Stop, I say I Oh, that is not an omnibus-it is the hearse, death's omnibus, which takes but one passenger at a time, and gives him a transfer ticket, free of charge; to old Charon's ferry, where he must pay his obolus for being carried to the land of shadows. And the carriages-they contain the mourners, at least the conventional mourners, who do duty as such, and follow on, with what sadness they may, after the corpse of him, who, in life, was perhaps indifferent to them. But here comes, at last, a real live omnibus, in which, for a sixpence, we may take a premature trip to Greenwood, and come back alive, and safe and sound. The ride is a long and dreary one, embellished with clouds of dust, that sift through whisker and moustache, and penetrate to the very brain. The prospect, on arriving, is not much improved-- a sandbank, crowned with a dilapidated shanty, in which the cock- roaches evidently have taken possession of the "Ladies' Refreshment Saloon,' is surrounded by a cordon of cabs and carriages, with a class of drivers of a peculiar type. They are, for the most part, native Long Islanders, shrewd and intelligent, but with the sentiment entirely bleached out of them, and who only feel an interest in the price of the ride which they expect to get out of you. But we won't ride: we will avail ourselves of this calm, clear, beau- tiful afternoon, and take a much needed stroll through these wild and beautiful grounds-this garden of the dead, where nature opens her arms smilingly to receive back the weary wanderer, who comes to take his * long, long sleep upon her kindly bosom. We city pent and dust- encrusted cits, whose lives are bounded by shop and parlor, and whose higher thoughts and aspirations are smothered by the dull atmosphere of routine, trade and traffic, need these occasional relaxations, these now-and-then breathings of the free air of heaven, even though it sweep over graves, to keep our hearts from becoming as callous and dry, and unfeeling, as the bones over which we tread. A walk in Greenwood is to us the realization of the old and ever true fable of Anteus, who received new strength from the touch of his mother earth. We enter at the stiff and narrow gateway, so awkwardly arranged that it would seem as if they begrudged to the silent applicants ad- mission to their grim domains    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.         103 Grim domains, indeed! Who ever saw anything more smiling and lovely than the fair landscape that begins to open and unfold around u s? Truly, the dead inhabit a most pleasant city, lying thus embraced with waters, the eternal sea murmuring at its very walls, and its winding streets lined with trees and roses. What a contrast to the senseless scramble of the living town I Here all is so still, so lovely, so serene- like a feverish, reckless and discontented life, glorified into the peace and beauty of eternity. Still, even these quiet shades whisper of a stil' greater change, and tell that this is not the final resting-place for those immortal beings whose bodies crumble here. Every tree is changing its colors, and the rich, deep green of summer maturity merges into a con- fused spectrum of diseased tints, that foretell the annual dissolution and resurrection of these children of the forest. The rose-vines and clematis, creeping lovingly among the graves, and twining their way from monu- ment to monument, have grown brown and withered at their vigils- and the turf upon the breast of each sleeping loved one is dry and sere. The perfume that but late led myriads of bees singing their drowsy song, from mound to mound of this Hymettus of the dead, no more loads the air. The winds that come up from the ocean, or sweep over from the land, are keen and biting; and, although the sun is bright and the blue sky bends over with its eternal arch of promise, and looks as with an eye of love into our hearts, yet the chillness strikes through bone and muscle) and we wrap our garments closer about us, andhurry on with quickened pace. We are not here to make a catalogue of ostentatious monuments, or to speculate upon the lives and 'histories of the sleepers beneath. But we cannot refrain lingering a moment at the Old Public Lot, before the humble grave of Bannister, the dramatic writer, once so well known in the reckless circle of the Green Room, now wholly forgotten there, as elsewhere. He was not a man of exalted talent, yet he possessed the genius of pleasing the popular taste. His melo-dramas and spectacles enriched those who owned them, and made permanent fame for those who acted them. He himself, however, with that helplessness which seems to exude from the inkstand, was always terribly in want, and obliged to submit to any exactions which were imposed Upon him-only ,*too glad, for a few miserable dollars in hand, to give up that which, properly managed, would have helped to produce a certain and sufficient income. He lived in want, and died almost in starvation. A large stone covers his grave, containing his name, and the quotation from Hamlet, "There is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow," &c. A tear and a sigh is the least tribute that even the stranger can pay as he lingers by the grave of N. H. Bannister. Here, too, is the only peaceful resting-place of poor Bengough, once an artist of repute, but who died in wretched and unmitigated misery. He was, in his best days, a lively, companionable and gay-hearted crea- ture, and some of those unknown friends, whom death for the first time brings to light, have erected a neat little monument over him, bearing a palette and easel, and another inscription from Hamlet applied t-. Yorick--"A fellow of infinite ;est," &c.     104     FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. And here, sadder than all, to us who knew him well, and, despite his great faults, loved him well, too, crumbles the form of Henry A. Buck- ingham-of whom we may well quote Willis' noble lines:  "He was born taller than he might walk beneath the starp; And, with a spirit tempered like a god's, He was sent blindfold on a path of light And turned asice and perished.': Poor Harry Buckingham 1 A more unselfish or manly heart than thine never beat itself to death, Courageous everywhere, towards himself, he did not dare to face the detail and the discipline of the science of life. To escape the meanness, as he called it, of being economical, he never earned money until he was compelled by hunger- then squandered in an hourwh4at had cost him so, dear, and reduced himself to the degradation of asking from those who owed him nothing. Disipation soon came in to aid in pressing him to the earth-friends wearied in their fruitless efforts to save him from himself-he went rapidly down, down, down, stumbling over every round in the ladder-- and, with all hit glorious gifts and noble aspirations--here he lies. Not a stone marks the spot where sleep the teeming brain; and throbr bing heart of one of fortune's most richly endowed and yet most unhappy children. And now we come to a little grave-indeed, a twin grave, if you mark it well. The history of that infant double grave-how, common, yet oh, how full of sadness i The first to claim this pleasant and dreamless sleep, and thus escape the fiery battle of life, fas a little.:girl, the first sole darling of the home she made so happy. Five years of unclouded love and joy-then Death strode over the sunny threshold, and his shadow darkened hearth and heart forever. No-not forever. Though the lost one is never forgotten, even for a single hour, yet the grief is softened; another has come to claim the empty place in the parent's hearts-a lovely, bright-eyed boy. Oh, how they love him I How fearfully and closely they cling to him, lest he too should escape them I And in the, fatal fifth. year, almost on the anniversary of his little sister's departure, he too bowed his head and returned to God, They have placed him side by side with their other lost darling-and they have added to the simple inscription that marked her silent cradles only, the touching words, "Her Brother." It fills the eyes with tears Ca to read it. Let us stop a moment at the neat. and charming grounds of the Unitarian Church of Brooklyn. Once we .wandered, in the bright summer, with a still brighter being, through its flowery mazes-but those flowers'have already bloomed five ever-bright. summers over her cold bosom, where the wild heart, once so joyous, beats no more forever. Childish and beautiful spirit seest thou me now, wandering idly among these withered flowers, and smilest in thy spiritualabode upon the way- ward,companion of thy brightest hours on earth? And seest thou that the beating heart is still unwithered, and that the full tide of glowing life pours panting through these veins,. fed with hopes, an4 passions and affections in which thou bearest no part? Farewell, "spirto gentil 1" -Since thou wert lain here, I have bent above thy grave, but not, as   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW     YORK.',    105 now, alone. Other tender eyes, looking out from a torn and fatally wounded heart, wept for the ineffable rest of thy fragrant bed. She, too, sleeps at last, and both your images mingle in a dim dream that floats above my head. Life's river is too strong and deep to pause before the graves that crowd its banks, even though the'wave remem- bers the faces that look into it no more. It is only when. the sunbeams of an eternal passion illuminated its profoundest depths and are with- drawn again, that the stream itself idries up.-- But we must idle no more among the idle graves-the pastime is too welcome, and. too sweet to be long: indulged; until oneJcOmbs here to claim citizenship in thisilovely and peaceful realm.

'     CHAPTER XXXI. 4 TOUCH   AT MANNERS AND MORALS. A YOUNG lady entering a crowded drawing-room, and finding all the- seats occupied, who should walk up to a gentleman and seat herself on his lap, would be very apt to create a " sensation." And a gentleman, who shouldl sit down beside a 'lady on, the sofa and put his arm round her waist, would most likely be ordered out of the house by the host, and horsewhipped by the lady's husband or brother. But young ladies in full dress with bare shoulders and arms think it all right to bundle into a full omnibus and seat themselves, sans ceremoni, upon the lps of men who 'are entire stangers to them, who may be pickpocket or blackguards, or who may have some cutaneous contagi- ous disease' Nay-they seem it capital fun ; and we actually saw a very ma gfcently got-up young lady, the other evening, set herself astride the ight and left knee of two gentlemen, and ride in that infa- mous and isgustiug position from twentieth street to Castle Garden. She was accompanied by a gentleman and two other ladies, and the whole party were evidently highly respectable." She took her seat with a giggle, and maintained it with as much sang froid as if she were sitting in a arm-chair of her own drawing-room. In the same stage, another das ing young lady came in and squeezed herself in between a lady and a man with crutches, making seven on the seat. The cripple soon got his arm round her waist-and when she left the stage, at Bar- clay street, a juvenile young youth, with a just sprouting moustache- a "fast" young man, who evidently knew more than his mother, left at the same time, and followed her down the street. She was evidently not a professedly bad character, yet nobody could pity her for thus vol- untarily subjecting herself to insult. Go into any theatre in New York, and you will find every other woman in the house, minus the old and ugly, with the arm of the next gentleman round her neck, and frequently the fingers tucked under her off shoulder, while the unconscious creature, looking as, if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth leans up against the manly breast, "like a sick kitten to a hot brick." This habit is becoming more and more prevalent. It would seem that men and women had no homes- no sacred places for, the exchange of their mutual endearments, and were reduced to the necessity of dragging the worship of the Lares and Penates into the streets and theatre. We do not know how this may strike other people, but to us it seems truly monstrpus. We are not over-nice or super-fastidious " but these daily and nightly exbibitions by soi-disant respectable, virtuous and more prvlet Itwudse   ha  e  n  oenhdn    o   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW     YORK.     107 refined young ladies, inspires us with disgust and horror. We- never see an exhibition of this kind without repeating to ourselves the obser- vation of a man experienced in the ways of woman: "The breast thus publicly resigned to man, In private may resist him if it can." Old Splitfoot, they say, is not so black as he is painted; but we declare that no one,- not even Mrs. Trollope herself, has yet done full justice to the detestable habit of tobacco-chewing and spitting, in pdblic places. It is, strictly speaking, an outrage of common decency for one to expectorate at all, in the presence of others. That is a function which the natural human instinct places with those which are to be performed in private. But now, nothing is more common than to see a 'whole bench at the theatre, or a pew in church, occupied by nasty wretches, all the time chewing anlL twisting their jaws about, distorting their faces, and squirting their disgusting saliva in all directions-leav- ing pools of liquid nastiness under foot, for the fine silk dresses and neat boots of the ladies to splash and draggle through. In omnibuses, cars, ferry-boats, &c., this habit is almost universal-and it appears to be espe- cially affected by our soi-disant fashionable young men. A man who spits in company is an unmitigated vulgarian, and ought instantly, on the first offence, to be kicked out of society. As to tobacco-chewing, it befouls the teeth and corrupts the breath to so great a degree that' a lady cannot, without a strong effort to over- come her repugnance, approach a man who indulges in this disgusting habit, though she may be ever so fond of him. And we verily believe that many cases of conjugal coolness and final estrangement-perhaps separation-may be traced directly to the foetid breath created by'chew- ing tobacco. Smoking is bad enough, and drinking wine is barely tol- erable-but to come near a neat, sweet, balmy woman whose instincts all spring from physical as well as moral purity, reeking with the yellow ooze of a tobacco quid, is an abomination that no delicate and sensitive woman can forgive. But spitting is an almost universal habit, even among those who do not chew. And a very dirty and injurious habit it is. This. continual exciting of the salivary glands eventually leads to a quasi inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea, and so goes down- ward to the substance of the lungs themselves, producing cough and  consumption. It is only a habit-entirely unnecessary to comfort or convenience-and which a resolute will and a decent ambition to be clean and respectable, can conquer in three days. Try it, oh I perpet- ual spitter 1 Whenever you feel an inclination to make a disagreeable grunt and eject your saliva in the presence of others, keep it down, and swallow a glass of Croton. You will find this cold water cure very easy and very effectual. The morals of the men are quite on a par with the morals of the women. Ever since the fall of man, which turned the beautiful uni- verse into a bazaar, and made all the men and'women mnerely shop- keepers, the vice of fashionable swindling has prevailed. Every now and then, some person of great respectability and unlimited credit, in     108    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND -NEW YORK. whom the whole community placed the most absolute confidence, is suddenly discovered to have been a swindler for years, and is removed at once from the circles where he has been so much respected, into the classification of the Tombs and the convict's cell. Gentlemen of dis- tinguished political position, after a life of active influence and useful virtue-eminent financiers, legislators, jurists, divines, whose names are honorably entwined in the very life of the community where they have grown up and prospered-are suddenly discovered to have been thieves, forgers, libertines, scoundrels, all this time, who, instead of enjoying all the honors of respectability and the beatitudes of wealth, ought to have been, at hard labor in the State Prison. Now, there is something appalling in these frequent illustrations of the gigantic injustice of human laws and human society, and in the uni- versal uncertainty, doubt and suspicion which they engender in every mind. If to-day a reverend divine, who for half a century has been regarded with veneration as a missionary of God among men, is discov- ered to be a libertine, a cheat, and a drunkard-if the man whom all Wall street regarded as the model of integrity and punctuality, commits forgeries for a hundred 'thousand on his own father, and escapes from the country, an unbranded felon-if a legislator of immaculate reputa- tion and spotless honor betrays his trust and swindles the government out of millions-what are honest men to think? Is it not natural that the man who examines his own heart, and finds that he is honest, and that ke is utterly incapable of any of these things, should look with dis- trust upon all around him? If these are guilty, who then is innocent? Why, it is enough to make a misanthrope or an anchorite of every really honest man in the community. And the worst of it is, that every one, in his own little circle of observation, knows several individuals of whom he greatly fears that similar things may be true. What is to be done to arrest this terrible progress of individual depravity, and the sus- picion and distrust it engenders?   CH-IAPTER XXXII. A SATURDAY NIGHT      A-MBLE. NEW YQor  is a sort of metropolitan aloe, aweekly plant that go-s intofull bloombut once in the seven days. During the rout of th0 week, everybody is engaged at his or her several ocupationu--th mechanic at his bench, the laborer at his hod, the ragopicker with hi bag, the beggar on his corner. Even the children of New York aro steady workers, notwithstanding their. pparent riotous idleness. The little girl with her .broom watches the sky for rain ; and when everybody else feels gloomy and uncomfortable, with: the shower. pa ttering abogt their ears, and their patent leathers spoiling in the mud/ she i, as merry as a clover-field to see the shower come down, and flies. :ther crossing as blythely as .a bee to the horse-hestnut trees.. The boys,ttoo,)al find employment-or employ themselves i ,trying to do -.for *a 4god. share of the time during the week. .But Saturday night is te p0or man's holiday. The laborer receiving his weekly pittase,. trdg homeward with- a light 'step, his honesthart ,selling with happine at the pleasure he is now able to confer upon thefamily. TEl newslvk y relaxes his cry, and gives -his overtaxed lungs repose-whil h: e dances into the street with insane glee, "bound to haveA ist-ratt spree." The pale house-wife, the ragged pauper, the tidy, the;wret^hbed, the handsome, the depraved-all welcome the .approach of Saturday night as a season to be' hoped and. patiently, waited for. In short, Saturday' night presents the city in an entirely :ear a ad more exciting aspect than any other time. of the week; :andhie. who has not closely studied it then, knows in reality buit half hisilesson. Let us set out from Nassau street. Six o'clock in Nassan street I and out-from the' narrow entrances and dark staircases of all those tall and many-:windowed buildings--up along Beekman, and Ann, and Fulton rstreets-the tide swelling rapidly, as i flows-pours into Nassau street the living stream of the New:.York' Gri- setterie seeking their homes, after the labors of the day. iBright faces, happy looks, trim ancles 'and cheap calico gownlsamingle as. far as yoaU can see-while plump shoulders and round chests, which would make' the West End die with envy, and covered with coarse grey. shawls or mering mantillas, swelling out grandly where health anddexercise habe placed the seductive inatural, tournure, that crinoline -attempts: irn vain to emulate-tell you that work is over, and that some ten thou- sand hard-working girls are let loose for the day. Where, will they, igo,     "O    FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK. now? How spend the evening? First, home, to tea, and a total meta- morphosis of their toilette. The calico gown will be replaced by the gaudy Catiarine street brocade-the brown hood by a dashing bonnet from Division street, twice as far off the head, and twice as " gallus," as Madame Lawson's best-and the grey shawl will disappear like Cinderella's kitchen robe, supplanted by a rakish and splendid matilla or scarf, falling off the symmetrical shoulders, and suggesting even! more than it reveals. Then, for Sykesey and the National, or Chris- ty's, or Owen's, or the Bowery, where an evening of right down hearty amusement repays them over and over again for all the hard work of the day. He who doesn't. see Nassau street at six o'clock in the day, misses one of the finest and most interesting portions of the great panorama of life in New York. Character, in many of its most piquant varieties, is to be studied :here; and beauty, in some of its rarest and most attractive fbrms-uniting delicacy with health and strength, and the modest demeanor of virtue with the undulating and free grace only possessed by women and waves-may be met with almost exclusively in these daily processions of the people. We wonder what these saucy, laugh- ing, romping, joyous creatures think of Lucy Stone, the Reverend Antoinette Brown, and the whole fanfaronade of Woman's Rights I 'But among all the indications of Saturday hight, no place affords so many or such striking ,ones as the markets. Here there is a regular c congestion; and, as in the single man the stomach is the principal point of commotion, so in the "grand man," or city, the market is the great focus of interest. He who lives at ease upon his income-or his land- lady-scolds if the steak be a thought muscular, or the eggs a shade too old-whose household experience consists in going to bed, getting up, breakfasting, dining, supping and sleeping, again-can 'scarcely form to himself any conception of the importance of Saturday night to the large class of our population who go to market but once a week. To themi the return of that time is waited for with hopeful stomachs, half fed during all the week on what remains from the last supply, and what can be "picked up" around. We know it is a melancholy thing to say, and still more melancholy to think of, that a couple of hundred thousand people in a single city-and those, too, who work the hardest and longest and in labors the most repulsive, and which ought, there- fore, to be the best rewarded-should be absolutely cramped for some- thing to eat But it is sadly true; Let us enter Washington Market. What a squeeze-what a crowd I It ie not here mere elbows and knees, and brawny chests, and broad, stout backs you-are to encounter. Now you stumble against a firkin, and now are overset by a bag. And there is a woman who has somehow-it is impossible to tell how-squeezed through between you and your next neighbor; but her basket, to which she clings with death- like tenacity, appears to be made of less elastic material than herself. It has assumed the position of a balloon, and forms a target for a score of noses pushed on from the rear. There is no chance of its coming. through, that is certain; and the woman will not let go of it-thatseems equally clear. There is nothing, therefore, to do but for you to stoop and crawl under it. As you are in the act of performing this difficult   FIFTEEN MNUTES AROUND NEW YORK.        II and delicate passage, a couple of salt mackerel at the bottom of the basket, as -if in sympathy for your suffering, bedew your Leary with briny tears, while a piece of corned beef, with a large slice of the fat, lovingly greases your coat collar. You at length get on your feet, and ascertain that you have been kneeling in a basket of stale eggs, and that your new black pantsare in, what would be called, in the Bowery, "something of a muss."  The Irish huxter woman, too, seeing this wholesale destruction of her brood of incipient chickens, pours out a vol- ley of abuse upon your devoted head, and loudly demands compensation for her loss. You gladly, pay whatever she requires; and at length, by dint of pulling and squeezing, and being pulled and squeezed, we make our way through the lower walk, past the butter and cheeze stands, the stalls for carcasses of dead hogs and sheep, now ankle-deep in mud, and so on into the fish market. If you are at all an amateur in smells, you surely will be gratified here to your heart's content. But don't tread on that pile of eels, for they are slippery fellows, and would be very likely to bring "you down upon them." And see there, a fine green lobster has caught your foot in his pincers, and will be through the leather directly. You will find him the closest friend you ever had. He'll stick like a burr. But all this is quite comfortable and genteel to Catharine Market, on the other side of the city. Here is New York life in one of its most ac- tive and demonstrative phases. So many attempts have been made to describe this class-all of them producing but the merest shadow of the original-that we should despair of better success were we to try the dangerous ground. Imagine all the coarseness, all the shameless filth, all the squalor and brutality from which you have escaped, and then conceive steeped in it to the lips a population made reckless by igno- rance, want and vice, and utterly regardless of public opinion, or even unconscious of its existence. Then you will have some faint idea of the many who frequent Catharine Market of a Saturday night. So be sure we do not mean to say there are not many respectable, weWto-do people who come there, but we speak entirely of the lower stratum of its cus- tomers.               . The truth is, that the condition, both moral and physical, in which such a city as New York permits its poor to exist, is utterly disgrace- ful-not to the poor, for they deserve only our deepest pity, ltut to the community--the powerful, enlightened, wealthy community-which per- mits its unfortunate children, who know nothing but how to work, to become thus horribly degraded. Are our readers weary of hearing this repeated? But it must be repeated and reiterated, until government and the wealthy know and feel its truth, and see clearly their bounden duty to that portion of their fellow creatures who are not able, in the sharp and selfish competition of keener brains, to takecare of them- selves.
