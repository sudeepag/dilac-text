Cowper. HE long-deserted village street-de- serted, save by two solitary fig- ures-had never looked so bleak and desolate as on that winter evening, more than twenty-five years ago. No welcoming stream of light fell across the pavement from any friendly win- dow, to give token of the cheerfulness within. In that primitive region the worthy inhabitants were, -most of them, enjoying their first sound slumber, and nothing but the baying of some wakeful watch-dog disturbed the stillness- nothing but those two lonely figures,'still press- ing forward with eager, anxious steps, varied the solitude.  ()     6   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. One of the two was a young girl, perhaps twenty years of:age, whose lithe, straight form -not lacking in grace and rapid movements- seemed to indicate that as yet no heavy care had laid its hand upon her, or tamed the natural gladness of her youth. Yet, had, the light suf- ficed to reveal her face, traces of deep and recent grief might have been discerned in all its feat- ures. Her companion was a lad about two years younger, and whose resemblance to her at once showed the relationship between them to' be that of brother and sister. At last, when they had nearly traversed the length of the street, they stopped before a shabby-looking house, whose sign-board an- nounced it to be the Green Hollow Hotel. Two or three lights were still to be seen in the windows, and their hasty knock soon brought a servant to the door. "Have you a vacant room?" was the lad's first question when the door was opened. "And what do you charge for that and a meal for five persons, two of whom are children?" The answer was in the affirmative, and the sum mentioned would seem to us ridiculously small; but Rose Carleton looked with a sigh at her slender purse, and, turning to her brother, silently shook her head. "But, dear sister," he remonstrated, "it is \   R. OSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     7 very cold, and you are so tired; besides, mother will be getting alarmed if we delay our return much longer." Rose still hesitated, and turned to look up the street. The sky was a black, impenetrable vault, and the eddying snow-flakes already filled the air ; besides, it was growing dark; so, with- out further parley, she allowed he orother to ask for the landlord, and the bargain was con- cluded. Then the two left the house, and has- tened to retrace their steps as fast as the dark- ness would permit them. Rose was the first to break the silence. "Well, Frank," she said, "we have tried our best to practice economy to-night, I think. We can not, at least, blame ourselves for dur want of success." Her voice was even cheerful, for she saw that her brother was vexed and anxious. She knew that he was easily discouraged, and she wished, if possible, to raise his spirits, although her own heart almost sank within her. He made no answer, and she continued: "It is better, after all, as it is. I see now that I was wrong and you were right how much more thoughtful and affectionate you were than I! Instead of being anxious to save money in this one instance, how anxious I should have been      8   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. for poor mamma to have a comfortable room and warm fire, especially to-night." Her voice trembled a little, and her eyes were dimmed with tears as she uttered her mother's name. "You mistake me, Rose," her brother an- swered, at last, "if you think I am worried about that paltry sum. No, it is not that which vexes me."  His tone had a certain ring of impatience in it that, under less favorable circumstances, might have become anger even to the gentle being be- side him, although the utmost tenderness of his nature flowed out to her; but the boy's spirit had been sorely chafed. by the trials he had been called upon of late to endure. "No, it is not that," he repeated; " nothing of the sort. It is that. it seems as though we Should never be able to cease to feel anxious about such trifles. What a wretched looking place this is! I know that you have the faculty of seeing the brightest side of every thing; but. does it not strike even you, Rose, that there is a very small chance of any thing offering for either you or me in such a neglected spot as this? I can not imagine what made us choose it, of all laces in the world, to come to!" Surely he could not again have so grieved that patient, loving heart, had he' but looked  W   ,    ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     9 down at her face, and seen the distressed and weary look that shadowed those soft, dark eyes -how full of affection for him-how mindful of the burden he had to bear-how regardless of that which weighed upon herself! But his mind was too much absorbed in contemplation of the darkening future to heed the gentler call of the present, or to reflect how far more important than any earthly gain-important as that was, at the time, to them-was the strengthening of that tender spirit, the comforting of that loving heart; to bear, instead of adding to, its burdens, and so fulfill "the law of Christ." So he scarce- ly heeded the gentle pressure of her hand upon his arm, that assured him of her ready sympathy, as she replied: "Perhaps the place will look brighter in the morning, Frank; we are seeing it under its worst possible aspect now, and surely papa must have had some good reason for fixing his choice here. You remember how hopefully Mr. G-- wrote of it. And, ah, dear brother, if we do not look higher than our own poor efforts for aid, how weak our dependence is!" She could say no more, and they hurried si- lently on. A few more moments of rapid walk- ing, and they reached their destination. It was the stage-office, near the entrance of the village, where they had) obtained permission for their     10   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. mother and two little sisters to remain while they went in search of a lodging. "Here is Rose, at last, mamma!" cried little Kate, springing forward to meet her sister. "Do, Rose, take us away from this cold, lonely place!" "Yes, love, we are going now; come and let me tie on your bonnet. We have succeeded very well, mamma," she added, cheerfully, turn- ing to her mother, " though it took a long time; and we had better start at once; come, Kate and Nora, you will soon have a warm fire, and something to eat. Let mamma go with Frank -I will take care of you." The children de- lightedly obeyed, and the little party set forth. It did not take long to reach the inn, where they were soon assembled around a cheerful fire, awaiting the call to their simple supper. The bodily comfort soon raised their spirits, and made each member of the little group more hopeful and content. To be sure, no carpet graced the floor, the furniture was scant and poor, and the curtains on the windows were old and even torn; but there was light and warmth, and to the children especially, after the long, cold ride in the stage, and the yet more dismal hour spent in the office, it seemed little short of elysium. By this time, supper was ready; and after   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD,     II partaking of it with much more thankful hearts than many who know no lack, Rose, at her mother's request, repeated a short psalm, and they all retired to rest. But it was long ere sleep visited the eyelids of Rose. Again she lived over the events of the last few months; again her heart was con- vulsed with grief for her father's death, while her mind was clouded by the dark uncertainty of the present. At length, as she tossed and wept, and found no rest, words of divinest com- fort she had pondered lbng ago came back to her memory with a clearer meaning than ever before: "Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass." And as the heavenly message soothed her troubled spirit, she suddenly called to mind that this day was the anniversary of the One on which, four years before, she had, indeed, committed her whole life and being into that Gracious Keeping. Ah, truer than any earthly friend, would he not be a Father to the fatherless, and direct their steps aright? A sweet feeling of security that could not be shaken filled her heart; she raised herself, and gazed long and tenderly on l@r mother's wan face, kissed her pallid cheek, and, with an ear- nest prayer to heaven for strength and guidance, composed herself to rest.

Tennyson. iT is time that we told something of , the f mer history of the Carleton fam y, and what mischance had re- du ed them  to their present diffi- cultms. Once theirs had been a pleasant home, where peace and plenty reigned, and the days and years sped by in sweet and calm succession; but they will never more be- hold that modest little homestead, endeared by a thousand recollections, or the green Irish hill-side on which it stood. There might they have ended their days, surrounded by all that.. they loved, had not Mr. Carleton, in an evil hour, consented to become surety for a friend. From that moment, till the day he died, his (12)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    13 peace of mind departed; he was ever dreading the storm which at length overwhelmed him in its fury, and devising vain means of escape. When, at length, no alternative remained but to bid farewell, perhaps forever, to the land of his fathers, and tempt the fortunes of a new world-to leave, behind him the labors of his life, and to see his children torn from their friends, and all the advantages with which he had delighted to surround them, and many of which can only be enjoyed in our native country-when he realized all this, the heart of the father sank within him; and, worn out by ceaseless anxiety, they had scarcely entered upon their voyage ere he was laid on a bed of illness from which he never arose. All through that dreadful time of grief, and suffering, and despair, Rose was her mother's great and almost sole reliance for help and comfort. She it was who quieted the fretful, tired children, and sang them to their nightly rest with the low, sweet lullabys they loved so well to hear; who soothed their frightened ques- tionings of when mamma would come to them, and why they never saw papa, by gentlest words of love and hope. Ah, brave young heart! how didst thou hope against hope during those dreary days! with what humble, agonized petitions didst thou beseech Heaven, while o     I4   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. those rosy lips murmured their childish prayer at thy knee! And when, at last, hopes and fears were alike over, when the ocean surges had hidden forever from their view the form so dearly loved, it was Rose who, mingling her tears with those of the sobbing, terrified little ones, yet strove to comfort and withdraw their minds from the painful present, by giving them -the surest consolation she could bestow- osome motive for their future; reminding them of their dear mother, to whom they would now surely give tenfold obedience and love. Her. mother was the great object of Rose's anxiety; entire and beautiful was the sympathy and attachment between mother and daughter; and all the graces that shone in the character of Rose seemed but a reflection from that of the other. Mrs. Carleton was a woman of no small strength of mind, and tenderly as she had loved her husband, rent as her heart had been by the bitterest grief mortal was ever called on to en- dure, she yet saw and felt how utterly false and recreant she would be to every claim of religion and natural affection-nay, even to his memory for whom she grieved-should she, left as she was, sole guardian of these. young lives, sink all her energies in ceaseless sorrow. This was the sacred trust committed to her hands, and with chastened, reverential joy did she accept it.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    15 "Ah, my sweet Rose," she said, as she em- braced her daughter, "God never blessed a mother with a truer, more devoted child. Life is short, my darling, at the longest; let us take it up, courageously and cheerfully, again; and peace, 'not as the world giveth,' shall fill our hearts." But the strain had been too much for bodily strength to bear, and a gtedious illness, from which she had but just recovered when they landed, set in, so that for the remainder of the voyage the chief care of the family concerns fell on Rose. Frank was her affectionate and able coadjutor, and her youth and unimpaired health prevented her feeling any of the evil conse- quences of such unusual fatigue. The. little group felt themselves to be stran- gers and alone in the. midst of those by whom they were surrounded, most of whom were igno- rant and selfish, caring little for any beyond their own contracted circle. There was one honorable exception, however, to this rule; one who did not, like the others, think that the timidity and reserve shown by Rose sprang from pride. This was a poor woman whose rich Irish brogue betrayed her nationality,.and whose uncouth face and figure might well provoke laughter among the thoughtless, but the fidelity and gratitude' of her heart would have done     I6   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. honor to a queen. Her whole soul was filled with pity and interest for the mother and chil- dren who had bidden adieu to the same beautiful island she had left, and to which the hearts of its exiles never look back but with the passionate yearning of the Israelite for the land of promise. But she had other and more substantial reasons for her regard. One of her children, a little boy, had been dangerously ill for the first week or two of the voyage, and Rose had found time, in the midst of all her own perplexity and grief, to perform many a little act of thoughtful kindness, which was now repaid with interest by those who had received it. The poor woman felt that noth- ing she could do was good enough for her "dar- lint Miss Rose ;" and many a time did she entice Kate and Nora away from their tired sister;while she amused them for hours by repeating quaint old legends and favorite nursery tales; or, at another time, when Mrs. Carleton, who was slowly recovering, had sunk into a refreshing slumber, would she gently coax the affectionate but weary watcher away- for half an hour, to taste the fragrant cup of tea or mealy potato she had drawn from her own little stores. She was coming out to America to join her husband, who had emigrated some two years before, and who was at last able to provide a poor but cheerful little home for them in the   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     17 suburbs of New York. With a beautiful deli- cacy which almost hesitated to make the offer, lest it should seem like reminding them of their altered fortunes, she proposed to Rose that she and her mother, with the two little girls, should remain with her for a few weeks, while Frank would proceed on the journey westward-io the place where they intended to settle, whence he could send word for them to come, when he had in some way prepared for their reception. The kindly refusal of Rose to accept the proffer was so skillfully worded as to leave no doubt that she fully understood the true motive which prompted the proposal. The poor girl had, indeed, weighty reasons for refusing. A short time after their father's death, and when they were daily expecting to come in sight of land, Rose and Frank had tearfully and gently asked their mother's consent, as she was too ill to attend to it herself, to investigating their fa- ther's. papers, that they might know exactly what means they had to depend on. The permission was readily given, and they began their sad la- bors. Frank knew that there should be a sum not less than five hundred dollars, which his father had told him was placed securely in a private desk; but the confusion and distraction of mind, consequent on the events which had occurred since then, had driven all memory of 2     i8   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. the place where it was concealed away. Rose and he, however, searched every place, probable and improbable, where it might be hidden, re- turning again and again, with fainting hearts, to athe vain search, for no discovery rewarded their efforts. At last they reluctantly accepted the conclusion that it must either have been stolen before or during the voyage, or through some fatal carelessness irrecoverably mislaid. All the means now at their command did not exceed two hundred dollars, so that it was of the utmost im- portance that they should proceed, with the least possible delay and expense, to their destination. "Well, mamma, what shall we do?" said Rose, when they consulted their mother. "I think the best thing to be done," answered Mrs. Carleton, "is to take passage in one of-the second-class railroad trains going west, as far as they can convey us; the rest of the journey must be performed by stage. This will be much the cheapest course to take; and, after all, the un- pleasantness it may involve will last but a short time." Rose said little, for she reluctantly acknowl- edged to herself that her mother had chosen the wisest solution of the dilemma; but when alone with her brother, she freely expressed her regrets. "Oh, Frank!" she exclaimed, "how  will mamma bear the confinement of those dreadful   ROSE CARLETON'S SEWARD.    19 cars and stages, surrounded by every class of people, rude and curious? And Kate and Nora,  too! You remember the shocking descriptions we have read of the stifling atmosphere, reeking with i he breathof so 'many passengers--the poor children will be suffocated! , Ah, how different it would have been with dear papa! Then we would have had our own wagons, and traveled at our pleasure." "I am ,very, very sorry," said Frank,', but I see no help for it; to stay in New York till some employment should offer itself, mother thinks is little short of madness. But cheer up;pJ Rose; perhaps it will not be so bad as we imagine, after all; those accounts we have read may have been written by prejudiced travelrs, and I know you are disposed to make the best:of every thing." A few days after this conversation they landed in New York, and taking an affectionate farewell of their humble friend, they started on their long journey, which happily proved to be not so pain- ful as they had all anticipated, and whith, in aftez years, gave rise to many a laugh, at the, quaint incidents which varied the route. At last, weary and dispirited, but rejoi6ed to have reached the end in health and safety, they arrived at the little village hidden among the Pennsylvania hills,; where we first found them, and to which, we will now return, to mark their future progress. /,.     CHAPTER    III. Love blessed their humble hearth, No stranger there, nor guest- An inmate true, thro' grief and mirth, Of every peaceful breast. HE morning sunlight streamed bright- ly into the room as Rose awakened from her lengthened slumbers, to find her mother already dressed, and Frank gone out to take a survey of the village, herself and the little girls being the only ones still enjoying their rest. "I did not like to awake you, dear," said her mother, as Rose remonstrated on the lateness of the hour, "for I knew you must have been sadly wearied." "Well, mamma, I am sure I ought to feel no weariness now," Rose answered gayly, as she hastened to complete her simple toilet. "Is it long since Frank went out?" "Not very," said Mrs. Carleton, looking out (20)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    21 on the street below. "I see him coming back now, and while we are taking breakfast we can decide on what is best to be done next." At. this moment Frank tapped at the door. "Really, Rose," he exclaimed, as -he entered the room, "this is quite a'pretty place by day- light; so rural and quiet-too quiet, I am afraid, tor our need-but I know you will be quite charmed." Rose's eyes expressed the pleasure she felt in her brother's opinion, though she said nothing. Mrs. Carleton opened the conversation at the breakfast table. "Now, the first thing to be accomplished" she said, while her eyes glanced fondly and anx- iously on the little group around her; "is to find a lodging. We can not afford too high a rent for this at present; it would be better to en- dure a little crowding and inconvenience now, till we are sure of some employment; we can easily change our abode if we prosper. So, Rose, you and Frank had better go out and make inquiries about this- at once; I will stay here with the children." But Kate and Nora were clamorous to have a share in the excursion, which looked so de- lightful to them, and could not be quieted till their mother assured them that, when "sister" returned, they would all go out together.     22   ROSE CARBETON'S REWARD. "Before you decide," she then continued, "you had better, perhaps,-" "Consult you, mamma?"Rose interrupted. "Yes, surely. I would not be content if you did not see the place first, too." "I am quite willing to trust to your judgment, my love,"- returned her mother, "but perhaps the people from whom we might be renting would think they could more readily impose on a young person. By this time Rose had donned her cloak and bonnet; so, kissing her mother and promising to be back soon, they descended to the street. Mrs. Carleton and the two little girls stood looking after them from the window of the inn; Frank's eager, handsome face and impetuous manner, as he turned to wave his handas a last adieu, forming a strong contrast to the quiet re- solve and cheerfulness of Rose. The widow's eyes were dim as she watched them disappear from her view. "Dear children," she murmured, "God bless them-God prosper them!"and her tears fell. "Don't cry, mamma," whispered the soft voice of little'Nora, who had climbed upon a chair beside her, while one round white arm was thrown over her mother's neck; "don't cry, mamma; won't sister soon come back?" "Yes, my pet," said her mother with an affec- /   %  -.ROSE CARLETON S REWARD.    23 tionate smile, and stooping to kiss the innocent lips that sought to comfort her, "I am wrong to sadden your fresh young heart." The last words were addressed more to her- self than to them, but the children, seeing her cheerfulness restored, were again happy and content, and were soon joyously helping to pack the few articles they had used the last night, that they might be in readiness to accompany Rose and Frank on their return, Meanwhile, the brother and sister proceeded on their tour of discovery. Before starting, they had asked the landlord's advice as to what direction they should pursue, and whether there was much likelihood of succeeding in their quest. He could tell them of no place at pres- ent vacant, he said, but one house-a small one, and sadly out of repair; but the village was not large, and they could easily make inquiry. Frank's opinion of the place was fully justified in the eyes of Rose as they walked through it. She had been far more depressed than she would have been willing to acknowledge to him the night before, and she was sincerely glad to see the cheerful view he was beginning to en- tertain. In truth, the beautiful sunshine, and clear, exhilarating December atmosphere, had not a little to do with the changed aspect of every thing around them. The snoiwstorm, of     24   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. which they had had a threatening the evening before, had entirely disappeared, but for a few flakes that still adorned the branches of some evergreens and whitened the roofs of the houses; the sky was as deeply blue as a sky in June, and the fine day made the little settlement the scene of unwonted activity. Surely hearts that were yet unpolluted by the world's breath might well yield to these gentle influences. None of the dwellings gave evidence of wealthy owners, but, though humble and unpre- tending, there was an appearance of thrift and steady industry very different from poverty. Rose noticed with delight that many of the little areas before the houses bore traces ot having been adorned in summer months with a few simple flowers, often transplanted from the neighboring woods, which spoke pleasantly of a love for the beautiful in the hearts of the inhab- itants. The brother and sister soon discovered that their only resource was the house which the inn- keeper had spoken of. They could easily have rented a room or two in one of the villagers' dwellings, but Rose shrank from subjecting her mother to daily, and perhaps unpleasant, inter- course with strangers, which. the retired life they had always led made doubly irksome. So, without further delay, they hastened at once to   ROSE CaRLETON'S REWARD.     25 the owner, to learn the rate of rent. He was by no means the-most liberal of the good people of Green Hollow, and, from the appearance of his visitors, falsely judged that he had at last se- cured a tenant above the common class in point of means; so he did not scruple to add a few dollars to his .original price before replying They endeavored in vain to induce him to lessen it, and at last departed to inspect the place, promising to return and make known their de- termination.            ,  The cottage was situated at one end of the village, and stood by itself, rather isolated from the other dwellings. It had been a pretty place once, but now it was in a state of sad neglect; the little garden looked desolate enough, with a few forlorn stalks of cabbage in the center and a crowd of tangled bushes in one corner. The only redeeming features were one or two trees. The area in front of the house had lost all trace of beauty, and the water dripping from the roof had formed a pool before the .door; many of the windows were broken; the. weather-stained walls did not give a hint of paint; and, indeed, the whole aspect of the place was discouraging in the extreme. "Well, my hopeful Rose," said Frank, mis- chievously, " what can you say to this?" "A good deal!" she replied, with an answer-     26   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. ing smile. "First, have you noticed that there are several fine-looking trees in the garden, whose fruit will be quite a boon to us in the summer? And then, brother, we can raise all the vege- tables we will need, with a little labor; besides,' . the house inside is pretty good. We will insist B on the owner's repairing the windows, and we can soon clear away the rubbish from around the doors. Then, you know, the garden will be something to interest the children, and they can play or work here under mamma's care, which could 'not be the case if we took rooms in the village. What do you think?" she added, laugh-. ing. "My speech is ended." "I believe I agree with you," said her brother. "Yes, I think we had better take it. We ought to get settled, that you and I may look around us for something to do. Ah, Rose, if we but owned this little spot, how pretty we could make it!" "Who can tell but we may, some day, Frank?"Rose answered, cheerfully, as they turned to go. "We must hurry and bring mam- ma to see it, that we may settle the bargain." "My sweet sister!" said Frank, tenderly, "how little I ever thought to see you in such  a place; but your brave spirit puts 'mine to shame!" "You praise me for too much, brother," said   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     27 Rose, affected by his words. "But do not la- ment for me; I hope and trust that we will suc- ceed; and, dear Frank, we may, some day not very distant, have a pleasant home we can call our own. I feel elated at the idea of working; 'the air of this new world has something inspir- ing in it."  "Yes," returned Frank, " so different from the old settled state of things at home. You are right, dear Rose, I know what you would say-that if we have but faith and patience, Heaven will help us. But here are the children watching for us." "What success?" asked Mrs. Carleton, as they entered the room. "Pretty well, mother," Frank answered; "we want you to come and decide." Rose, meanwhile, was busy arraying the little girls in their outdoor garments and answering their eager questions. They were soon on their way, telling their mother, as they walked, the particulars of their inquiry. Mrs. Carleton took the same view they had done of the position of affairs; and it was de- cided for her and Frank to go and conclude the contract, while Rose and the children would await their return. They were not long absent -at least, it did not seem so to, Rose, who, with Kate and Nora, was busy exploring their new ,         \r     28   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. domain; and as soon as the two messengers came back and reported their success, Frank set off to procure the little luggage they had brought. A man came, in an hour or two, to re-glaze such of the windows as stood in need; and when Frank returned, he found a cheerful fire enlivening one of the rooms, and all, includ- ing the children, ready to work. Kate had al- ready collected quite a little store of small pieces of wood that she had found near hand, and with which they had kindled the fire. This at once suggested to Frank the need of procuring some fuel; so, leaving Rose and his mother to un- pack, he hastened to request their landlord to oblige them with a temporary supply till they should be able to get some themselves. The man was well pleased at having at length dis- posed of his house, and readily granted the re- quest-offering, himself, to order a supply for them, which Frank at once, with many thanks, allowed him to do. Re-assured in this important particular, he and Rose, with some assistance and advice from their mother, proceeded to arrange the little furniture they had. Happily, they had taken the precaution to purchase a few. articles' on their journey, as they feared it would be difficult to procure them so far from the large towns. There was but one carpet, and this they agreed 4.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    29 to put on the room they wished their mother to occupy. This room would be the- gathering place of the family in the evenings, and they would thus economize comfort; but though this consideration helped to determine their choice, affection for the dearly-loved mother was the ruling motive. Working steadily 'for a few hours, they soon had every thing arranged; and Rose proceeded to prepare a simple meal, for they all stood much in need of refreshments. Their only table was set in Mrs. Carleton's room, and, with a'shy glance at her mother, who only remonstrated by a smile, Rose drew forth a snowy cloth to cover it, and set out a few articles of old china-heir- looms that they would not part with ;-and, indeed, they had at present no other dishes, though Mrs. Carleton intended purchasing some on the morrow. So the little table looked quite gay, with the fresh, golden .butter, and white bread, and fragrant tea Frank. had purchased during the day. Ah, that first tea in the new home-so different from the old-so cheerful, yet so sad! who of that little group would ever forget it? Mrs. Carleton's voice shook with emotion as she asked a blessing on the repast, and Rose's tears fell freely; Frank, too,. was much affected, and even Kate and Nora felt the influence. The excitement and worry of the     30   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. day had given an unnatural sustainment to their spirits, but reflection was busy now, when the toil was. over, recalling the past. But Mrs. Carleton knew too well the difficulties which lay in her children's path to sadden them-with vain regrets, and was the first to set an example of cheerfulness; so, before the meal was over, the little party were pleasantly discussing their new abode and laying plans for the morrow. Thus the quiet evening drew to a close; and, after offering up their prayers and thanks to Heaven, one by one, they separated to their rest. There was something peculiarly touching and beautiful in Frank's good-night to his mother; the boy's heart was thrilled with pity, affection, and reverence as he gazed on that pale face. He remembered how tenderly his father had loved her and sheltered her from every storm, and his ardent young spirit vowed to be faithful to her evermore. "The only son of his mother, and she was a widow"-how much of sorrow and of anxious love is centered in those words! They came to Mrs. Carleton's mind as she gazed on her handsome stripling with eyes dimmed by proud and loving tears-she had no fear that he would ever give her cause for any other-and blessed the Hand that still left so many treas- ures to her on earth:   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     31 "To-morrow will be the great day," said Frank, gayly, as he bid good-night to his sister; "so prepare yourself for the conflict, Rose, by a peaceful slumber and happy dreams." -^t as^ , *            t     CHAPTER IV.

ARLY the following morning the whole family were astir. Rose dressed her little sisters, as had always been her wont, while Mrs. Carleton prepared the breakfast; and Frank, thoughtful for his mother's comfort, carried in a small supply of wood, to last while he and Rose would be absent; for, immediately after breakfast, they intended setting out in dif- ferent directions, to solve the all-important prob- lem of getting something to do. Rose and her mother had already formed a plan, which they hoped to be able to execute; but Franle had as yet no definite course of con- duct marked out on which to act.  Mrs. Carle- (32)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     33 ton had always been exceedingly anxious on the subject of her children's education, particularly the womanly education of her daughters; and in their manual as well as intellectual progress had always endeavored to lay the basis of solid and lasting excellence, before rearing the lighter and more graceful structure of what are com- monly termed accomplishments.  Kate and Nora were, as yet, too young to exhibit much proof of her training, but Rose was an instance of which any mother might well be proud. Sewing-machines had not then entered upon  the scene of woman's labors, but the dainty . stitches set by Rose's busy fingerscould easily bear comparison even with ,their work. I con- fess to a-liking for the old way, though I hail the sewing-machine as one of the greatest indus- trial blessings; yet never can the work per- formed on it whisper so eloquently to the heart as that over which was spent, perchance, hours of pleasing reverie, and in which a mother's or a sister's love is entwined in every thread. Well was it for Rose Carleton that she had from her earliest girlhood been made familiar with this most womanly handicraft. Beautiful and de- lightful as was her skill on piano or with her pencil, and wrong and cruel as it would have been to have deprived her of the advantages the position of her family afforded, yet of how little 3     -34   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. avail would this knowledge only have proved in l   her new situation? Gladly, indeed, would she resume their practice, should fortune once more smile upon her pathway; but her cheerful, un- affected humility would prevent her from ever repining at their withdrawal, should they never be restored, though her pleasure in them had been as great as it is possible,for any soul, im- bued from its earliest infancy with a love for harmony and beauty, to feel. Indeed, to her affectionate heart the hardest thing to accept was relinquishing the delightful hope of imparting this knowledge to her little sisters; but she could still teach them much; and Kate, who already showed some taste for drawing, might, under her careful training, make great progress. But to return. Rose was a sjiperb needle- woman; the plainest sewing done by her hand was beautiful, though she did not lack skill in daintier branches. Her own clothing, the ex- quisite neatness of which was a thousand times preferable to the tawdry ornamentation with which so many delight to deck themselves in- stead, bore evidence to her just taste. It was on the fact of her excellence in this department of education that her plan was founded. Her mother agreed with her that, could she but form a school for teaching this k        ,  ,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     35 and a few other branches, such as good reading, its daily session to last for four or five hours, it would be the most feasible and pleasapt course she could pursue, besides leaving her time, should she choose, for other occupation. The great point to be discovered, and one which would largely determine her success, was whether any one had occupied the field before her. This plan, which had from the first dimly shaped itself in Rose's mind, sprang into definite form the moment they entered their new abode. The house boasted four small rooms and an attic, and one of these could be devoted to this purpose, and Rose could have the delight of being at home even while pursuing her daily avocation. "Kate and Nora must form part of your class," her mother had said, when they were discussing the scheme. "It will be good for them, and en- able you to become more familiar with'the over children." "How will you like that, my sweet little girleen?"Rose answered, laughing, catching up her favorite for a kiss. "Ah, won't these soft, wee fingers of yours, Nora, show many a mark of the cruel needle!" But the little one gravely shook her curly head and seemed to think that "Sister/Rose's school" would boast few cleverer pupils than herself. "The best person to apply to first," Mrs.     36   ROSE CARLETON'S REBWARD. Carleton continued, "is the village store-keeper; he will be naturally anxious to secure our custom, and will, perhaps, be flattered by our consulting him; besides, he will be the one best able to tell you all you will need to know about the people." But Rose and Frank have long ere this de- parted on their different missions, and we must needs follow them. Adhering to her mother's advice, Rose bent her steps to Mr. Breton's store; she made a few needful purchases, and then opened the impor- tant subject of conversation. He was a man naturally inclined to be generous, and his busi- ness was prospering; so he lent a ready and attentive ear to her proposal, lightened her heart by telling her she was the first who had started the idea, and introduced her to his wife, who was equally pleased with the scheme. They immediately headed her list with the names of their own little girls, and Mr. Breton promised not to forget to speak of it to any of the neighboring farmers who might chance to enter the store, as Rose could only apply, herself, to those dwelling within the village limits. Of course, his tuition fee would be paid in merchan- dise, but this was no disadvantage, as they would necessarily require many things they could only procure from him. So Rose departed, with heightened spirits, in   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     37 quest of new pupils, hoping every thing from so successful a beginning. But her sanguine ex- pectations were doomed to many a bitter disap- pointment, as, foot-sore and weary, she traversed the distance from house to house, meeting, often- times, looks of distrust and cold denial, instead of the warm acceptance for which she had hoped. Rose's disposition, however, was not a de- spondent one. When she heard many of the ignorant and covetous women, to whom she offered her proposal, declare that they had passed through life very well without much knowledge of these things, and that their children could do  the same-content rather with paying a few extra dollars to some dress-maker who announced her- self as " fashionable," instead of putting it in the power of their daughters to do the same work themselves; utterly ignoring the fact that while, truly .enough, they could, under their circum- stances, pass through life-tolerably well, slenderly furnished as they were for some of its require- ments, their children, attaining their age, would be introduced to an entirely new state of soci- ety, where much they could neglect with safety would be indispensable to comfort or happiness. When Rose heard and reflected on all this, in- stead of yielding to the utter discouragement some would have felt, she thought that, could she but succeed in making a beginning, the im-     38   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. provement she hoped to make manifest in their neighbors' children would induce them to alter their opinion and confide their own to her care. She sought, also, the enlistment of the chil- dren's sympathies in her cause; and what girlish heart, however young, could resist the tempta- tion of the beautiful specimens of her skill which Rose displayed to their eager gaze? She soon discovered, too, the taste and longing for music, inherent in so many youthful breasts. Rose had a delightful voice, and found that the offer to teach a little singing was received with great favor, so she soon had powerful allies in her ex- pectant pupils. But though some of the parents opposed her thus, there were others who gladly welcomed her with open arms; who having suffered the evils of ignorance themselves, determined that their children should never know like deprivation. Ah! the young teacher's had been a doubly thorny path had it not been for a few like these, though the poor pittance she claimed as her re- ward might well appeal to any heart not wholly devoted to "the root of all evil." So, when, in the waning afternoon of the short winter day, Rose turned her steps homeward, with all the difficulties she had had to encounter, she felt content and even elate at the success of her experiment.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     39- Frank joined her at the garden gate, and both entered the house at once, eager to hear each other's adventures, and to relate them to their waiting listeners. Kate was busy laying the tea-table, her mother was preparing some simple dish; but the picture which riveted Rose's attention most was little Nora, seated on the floor beside a pile of rough blocks, wholly absorbed in her play. The fire- light glanced on her golden hair, and lit with a rosy glow her soft, round cheek, while the clear, deep, violet eyes 'looked thoughtfully at her work. A slight movement turned the at- tention of 'all toward the door, and mother and children rushed forward to welcome the new comers. "Now you must not say a word," said Mrs. Carleton, embracing them, while she removed their wrappings, "till you have got rested and warm, and by that time tea will be ready. Sit at this side of the fire, Rose, I am sure your feet must be wet. Frank, here is a nice warm corner for you." "Ah, but dear mamma, let me tell you a little," Rose pleaded, "while I am resting; indeed, it won't tire me." And Frank and Kate uniting their voices to hers, Mrs. Carleton gave a smiling assent. "I see by your face," she said, "that your     40   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. news is good, and I own to being full as eager to hear it as any of you." So Rose began the recital of her adventures, with little Nora nestling in supreme content within her arms. "Well, then, mamma," she said, "in the first place, I have succeeded grandly. I have got the promise of twelve pupils, who all pay in advance, and-what day is this, Frank?" "Thursday." "So it is; well, my school begins on Mon- day morning; and I hope to get a few more children, for Mr. Breton promised to speak to some of the farmers I could not see. What do you think of my day's work?" she concluded, gayly. "Very well, indeed," her mother answered; "you could not have done better. But you have overlooked one thing, Rose." "What is that, mamma?" "I can not imagine how you are going to provide seats for your pupils." "Or wood for your school-room fire," added Frank. "Oh, I am cleverer thSn you think," replied Rose, laughing; "that difficulty is all nicely. ar- \ ranged. Mr. Breton said he would see that the fuel was provided by contributions ,from the parents; and I exacted a promise that every   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    41 child should bring a chair or other seat for herself." "You are a clever little rogue!" exclaimed her mother, kissing her, while Frank's voice and Kate's chimed in congratulations. "But now, brother," said Rose, when quiet was restored, "let us hear your story." "He can tell it while we are at tea," interposed Mrs. Carleton, "for it is now waiting." So they gathered round the table, ready to lend attentive ears to Frank's narration. "I have not been nearly so successful as you, Rose," he -began, "but I must try and be con- tent for the present, as I can discoyer nothing better than what I have obtained. You know, mother, what I wished if possible to do, was to get a place on a farm as a sort of'head-worker;' but I found that to be wholly out of character here, where all the farmers oversee their labor- ers themselves, and even work harder than any of them. Even so, I would not have objected to the toil, rather than have to lead other than a country life; but winter is a bad season to look for such employment, and I was rejected by all the farmers to whom I spoke, though some of them held out a hope of employment in the spring." "We might have known," said Mrs. Carleton, "that the idea could not be carried out now."     42   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "But I was so anxious," replied Frank, "not only for the work, but for the sake of the expe- rience it would have given me as to the best way of cultivating the land here; and if we could have laid aside a-little money, added to what we have already, we might, as land is so cheap, have been able to get a little place of our own." "But, brother," answered Rose, "we need not throw aside that hope yet; the winter will soon pass, and with the spring something new may offer. But let us hear what you did." "Well, then," he continued, his sister's words chasing away the momentary vexation which had clouded his face, "as a last resource, I re- paired to Mr. Breton's store, in the faint hope that he might be in need of a clerk. Fortunately for me, you had left the store, Rose, about half an hour before I entered it; and Mrs. Breton, especially, had been so charmed with you, that I suspect my success was more owing to that than to any merit of my own; at any rate, she inter- ceded so powerfully in my behalf, that her hus- band has accepted me as his assistant. When he saw my hand-writing, he at once stipulated that part of my time should be spent in teaching it to his little son. He told me he had emigrated four years ago from the Eastern States; this ex- plains his desire for his children's improvement. "But this has given me a new idea, Rose.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     43 What do yoz say, mother, to my teaching a class of boys writing, two evenings in the week? The store closes at seven o'clock, and I could have the use of Rose's school-room from that till eight." "The thought is a good one," Mrs. Carleton answered, hesitatingly; "but I fear it would task you too heavily, Frank--at least, just now; how- ever, we have time to think it over, and it is now quite late;. your young shoulders have borne heavy enough burdens for to-day; it is time you were at rest; to-morrow will be a busy day for all of us. Good-night, good-night, my dear, good children-my darlings!" as they clung to her, and kissed her with tremulous lips.' "God bless you, God reward you! I know he will, even in this life, and how much more in the life to come!" Her eyes, raised heavenward, seemed to im- plore a blessing on their heads; and a sacred calm, like a benediction from above, fell gently on their hearts; abode there, as they parted to their peaceful rest, as though the spirit of their loved one beheld, well pleased, fheir concord and affection.     U-. CHAPTER V. Each morning sees some task begun, Each evening sees it close; Something attempted, something done, Has earned a night's repose. Longfellow. GhWT   was no wonder Frank Carleton shrank from the life before him; his i,  f*g^%   free, glad youth had been so differ- ently spent on his father's beautiful f: )4  ^  farm-those fair; fertile acres he had once looked on as his own inherit- ance-now gone from him forever. a    Many a bitter tear had the boy shed in secret li   over the loss of that beloved home, as visions of the peaceful days there passed rose up be- It.   fore him.  All his instincts, training, wishes, t   pointed to the farmer's life as the one for him to follow; he had read much, and pondered Itj   well, and Washington's beautiful words had it   sunk deeply into his mind: "Agriculture is the 1r.  most healthful, the most useful, the most noble (44) lo .   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     45 employment of man." His every-day experi- ence had proved this true, and, therefore, it was, that he would rather have accepted hard toil, and even smaller remuneration, than enter on a life he so thoroughly disliked. We must do him justice, however, and not think it was selfishness that prompted this feel- ing, which must have subjected those he loved to present deprivation. Frank looked forward to nothing else than farming as the business of his life; this had been their object when they first thought of emigration, and, naturally enough, he regarded the hours spent in the dull routine of a country store as so much wasted time-stolen from the pursuit on which his heart was set. In this he differed from Rose, who accepted, with ready gratitude, what- ever was possible to be done for the time, and did not regard herself as necessarily committed to that course of life, though it might be the only one open to her at present. Much of this hopefulness was owing to her natural disposi- tion; much, also, to her deep, religious sense of trust; and all allowance must be made for Frank, who, ardent and impulsive, was easily dejected by a reverse; it was, therefore, quite a triumph of duty and affection to enter, with the ready cheerfulness he did, the path that lay be- fore him.     "  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. And who would not honor him for his innocent aspirations toward an honorable, independent career? Ah! how'many there are, who, instead of looking forward with eager longing to such a peaceful future, would have gladly rushed into the vortex of city life, loosening every sacred tie that bound them. Who would not sympa- thize with the free, fresh heart, that, torn from its green fields and breezy hills, echoes the ex- clamation of "Mary Powell," when a stray glimpse of what they have lost carries them back to the past-" h! sweet country life! I was made for you, and none other." And Frank knew the value of what he re- jected. He had seen city life under its most fascinating aspects. His father had been'fond of taking him with him on his rare journeys from home, and once and again had Frank vis- ited the fair capital of Ireland, and shared with all the zest of one to whom they were a novelty in the pleasures incident to a sojourn in the me- tropolis. His feet had trodden the pavements of Dublin's most beautiful thoroughfare, Sack- ville Street, described by one who holds high rank in literature, as being "a hundred perches in length and six in width, with a noble monu- mental pillar (in honor of Nelson) in the center, and some of the finest public buildings in the world lending it their effect." He had lingered   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    47 in delight over the treasures of art and science which are there so richly stored; and commerce had allured him to its pursuits by the most splendid series of shops and warehouses that perhaps any city can show; yet, even there, young as he was, he had gladly turned to the peace and love of his own dear home, to its rural charms and happy toil, pleased, but not dazzled, by the contrast he had witnessed. Mrs. Carleton was familiar with every thought and feeling of her son; nevertheless, she was secretly pleased with the turn affairs had taken, though she would not, on any account, hint this to him, lest it should add to hisdisappointment. She knew too well the difference between his former life at home and the one he would be expected to fulfill now, had the employment he sought been procured, not to feel great reluc- tance to his entering on it; though she had not opposed him, knowing the need there was of procuring immediate work, and fearing to ren- der his path more difficult by her remonstrances. She now encourahdhim by all the means in her power in what he had undertaken; showing him that a few months thus spent would be of great use in making him acquainted with the manners and customs of the people, and with their habits of thought. Frank could not but agree with what she said,     48   iOSE C ARLETON'S REWARD. and his face looked bright and hopeful as, early the next morning, he left them, to begin his new duties. "And now, mamma," Rose said, smiling, as she closed the door on his retreating footstdps, "I too, must prepare for work; only to-day and to-morrow for fixing up the school-room-and these winter days are so short." "Have you decided which room to take?" asked Mrs. Carleton. "Oh, no, not yet; I want you to choose that." "Then, I think the best one for your purpose is that looking out on the street; it is sunny, and cheerful, and easy of access." "Well, mamma, as you say; only it is almost a pity-next to this one, it is the pleasantest room in the house." "No pity at all," replied her mother. "You and the children will be there constantly, at least half of each day, and I will often join you; remember, too, my dear, that much of your pu- pils' liking for the school will depend ori giving them a cheerful place to work in. .Here is some kindling wood. We will leave Kate to wash the breakfast dishes, and you and I will go and light a fire, and prepare to clean the room." It was a mild sunny day, though Christmas was only a week distant; and the bright skies and balmy, spring-like atmosphere invited to   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     49 activity. The apartment was soon warm with a sparkling wood fire; and Rose, baring her arms, began to clean the windows, with many a merry laugh at her awkwardness in her novel occupation. The love of employment is infectious, and she had not been long at work before little Kate, having finished her task, stole in, and begged to have a share; Rose laughed, but yielded, and they went on merrily together; and, though they had not much knowledge of their new vo- cation, made good progress. Mrs. Carleton, af- ter giving them a few hints, went to prepare the dinner, taking Nora, who had followed Kate into the room, with her, for safe keeping, and lest she should hinder her sisters in their work. So steadily and well they wrought that, when Frank's knock sounded at the door, and their mother returned to summon them all to the noonday meal, their task was nearly accom- plished-the windows sparkling and clear, and half the floor much whiter than it had been. Rose and Kate hastened to arrange thoir dis- ordered hair and dress, and they were all soon assembled in the cheery little kitchen, with ap- petite sharpened by toil and fresh air. "I am sorry we can not afford a covering for the school-room floor," said Mrs. Carleton, as she took her seat at the head of the table; "the     50   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. tread of so many little feet, especially in winter, will entail a great deal of labor, I fear; besides, the noise will be very disagreeable." Frank interrupted her eagerly- "Maybe it is not so far out of our reach as you think, mother. What would you all say to mak- ing a carpet ourselves, of long strips of useless cloth-in fact, a rag-carpet?" "Oh, brother, you are jesting!" cried Rose. "A carpet of rags.? Impossible!" "But it is true, nevertheless," Frank answered, laughing at the incredulous faces around him; "for I saw it to-day; and very pretty it was, too. Mrs. Breton called me into their dining- room to ask some questions, I forget what, about your school, Rose, and my attention was at once drawn to the strange, new covering on the floor. She told me all about it, but I can not explain the mystery of making it as well as she did; the cost is so little, that it is a great pity to do without it. If you have time this evening to give her a call, I am sure she would be glad to enlighten you." "It would be well for you to do as Frank says, Rose," Mrs. Carleton said, when he had gone. "You can easily finish all that you need to do in the school-room to-morrow morning; and you might injure yourself byj such unusual fatigue at first."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     5 "Agreed, mamma, but you will come with me, won't you? Kate can take care of Nora till we return-can't you, Kate?" turning to her little sister, who, proud of the trust, replied, with an eager "Yes."  Her mother's first impulse would have been to refuse, for it was painful to her to meet new faces; but she could not bear to shadow the brightness in Rose's eyes, and gave a cheerful consent. Cloaks and bonnets were soon brought, and, after many careful instructions to the chil- dren, and promises to be back soon, they left the house. Rose was glad of an excuse to raise her mother's spirits by a walk in the fresh air, and rattled on in merry, happy talk till they reached the store-keeper's dwelling. Very differently, in- deed, did she feel, too, when she had last trav- ersed that path; then, her heart was sad with doubt and uncertainty; now, with Frank's earn- ings added to her own, they were sure, for the present, at least, of keeping poverty from -their door. Mrs. Breton received them kindly; gave them much information concerning the place and peo- ple; congratulated Rose on her success in her new enterprise-"though she had not had a doubt," she said, "but that it must. succeed, as she and many others had long wished for a (S  .     52   ROSE OARLE1'ON'S REWARD. school of that kind;" and last, but not least, made them thoroughly acquainted with the plan of manufacturing a carpet themselves; showing them how to sew the strips of cloth together, and giving them the commencement of a ball, to take home as a pattern. "Won't. it be nice, mamma?"Rose said, de- lightedly. "Only I am afraid we can not make as pretty a carpet as yours, Mrs. Breton," she added, stooping to examine it more closely. "Oh, yes, you can!" their hostess added, smiling. "A good deal depends on the direc- tions you give to the weaver; he is a son of one of the farmers living near here, and is very obliging-I am sure he will do it as nicely as possible." "We will begin to work on it this very night," said Rose, as they took their leave; "I am im- patient to see it finished." And truly, never house witnessed such an eager search for old or out-grown garments as did Mrs. Carleton's, when she and Rose re- turned. Unfortunately for their object, most of the wearing apparel and household gear they possessed was new, or so well preserved as to be equally unattainable; and it was but a sorry show of material for her purpose that Rose at length brought for her mother's inspection. "Is n't it too provoking, mamma?" she ex-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     53 claimed, looking disconsolately at the small re- ward of her laborious search. "We will have to give up all thought of such ax thing for years to come." "We will look again to-morrow," Mrs. Carle- ton answered; "but I know we can not find. much more than what you have already Agt. I am sorry for your disappointment, dear; though really, Rose," she added, smiling, "is it not a- little amusing to hear you lamenting that all our clothing is new?" Rose blushed at the gentle reproof, and could not help laughing herself, as she thought of it. "'We must put these vexatious things away," added her'mother; " it is time the candles were lit, and Frank will soon be coming to tea." Rose hastened to assist her, and had almost forgotten her disappointment when her brother knocked at the door. Kate flew to open it, and Frank, setting down a large basket, which hung 'upon his arm, stopped to return his mother's welcoming kiss before replying to the babel of questions that greeted his return. "So you did visit Mrs. Breton this even- ing," were the first words he said, turning to -Rose: "Yes," she answered ;" but we might almost as well not have done so; only think, brother, I was so stupid as to forget that we could not     54   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. possibly make a rag-carpet, for lack of any thing to make it of." "Oh, but some Qe has thought of that be- sides you," he replied,r merrily, proceeding to open the basket. "Mrs. Breton says, mother, that you must not be offended with her for sending you this; she came into the store a few moments after you had gone, to tell me that it had occurred to her that we might not, as we had emigrated so lately, have any thing we could afford to use for such a purpose; and Rose, she said, was so eager to begin, that she could not bear to have her disappointed; so she begged leave to send you these few articles, which were of no particular use to her, and she would be glad to be able to oblige you. There is not enough to make a carpet--at least, not a large one, but, maybe, with what we can muster of our own, it will do." Rose had been absorbed in exploring the basket long before the conclusion of Frank's speech, and now exhibited her trophies flushed; and triumphant. "Indeed, we won't be offended-will we, mam- ma? Just see how many things she has sent! I am so glad-we can begin our work to-night, after all. She was very kind to think of it." Rose did not know that she had quite won upon the affections of the good people of Green   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    55 Hollow, by her ready appreciation of a manu- facture in which they prided themselves as ex- celling. Tea was soon over, enlivened by Frank's ac- count of his first day's store-keeping, and the sweet household talk so familiar to us all; then he had to leave them, to return for another hour to the store, and they fell to work on their new project. When he came back he found them all busily engaged, except Nora, who was lying sound asleep on her mother's bed; and they con- tinued their occupation until weariness warned them of the approach of the hour of rest. I need not relate the incidents, of the many happy evenings thus spent; nor how the occu- pation, at first possessing the charm of novelty, but soon growing irksome, was followed through- out with undaunted perseverance, even Frank, boy though he was, sometimes taking part in the work, but oftener reading aloud to the rest from some entertaining book drawn from the little store that still remained to them. Often, afterward, did they all look back, with something of regretful longing, to that first quiet winter in their new home; sad and lonely though it had often seemed, they had yet possessed the com- fort and blessing of each other's presence-a boon never fully understood until it was with- drawn.     56   ROSE CARLET'OL'S REWARD. A Suffice it, however, to say, as the result of their labors, that, six weeks from the evening on which they began, they spread their first rag-. carpet in triumph on the school-room floor. And a really pretty carpet it was, too-one of which they might justly feel proud, so gay and bright it looked, enlivened by strips of the pretty plaids the children had worn in other and happier years. It did not, to be sure, quite cover the floor, but Frank had neatly painted the space left bare, and the room's appearance or comfort did not suffer from the lack. They honored the day as a little festival, and, in the evening, Rose gave to Frank, neatly folded in an envelope, a beautiful collar, wrought by her own hand in rare moments of leisure, to give to Mrs. Breton, as a little token of thanks for her friendly aid. Mrs. Breton's delight at this delicate return P   of her kindness may easily be imagined; Rose had always been a favorite with her from the time they first became acquainted, but she was now rendered doubly so; and it was no light It   thing in Green Hollow to have won the friend- ship of the store-keeper's wife, for she was gen- erally respected and looked up to, throughout the settlement, as one of superior knowledge and ability. Moreover, at the simple social gatherings she attended, she failed not to deck , i    ROSE CARLETONV' REWARD.     57 herself with Rose's gift, nor to tell who was the donor, and so contributed, not a little, to raise the young teacher's reputation, and her school increased in favor every day. But I have been anticipating my story, and must return. The busy Saturday passed, and Rose had her school-room all ready for beginning on Monday morning-the children having supplied the seats that afternoon, that they might have nothing to attend to the first morning but their lessons; and the Lord's Day came, with its sweet, sad memories, its holy observances, its quiet con- verse; and it, too, vanished, and the week of toil began again.  I would fain picture to your mind the scene of Rose's labors that first morning. I love to linger over the first brave effort of that sweet young life toward independence-the honest pride of industry that so well deserves success. For hers could have been that genteel choice of dependence on a rich relation, which she so justly abhorred; not because'of any ignoble unwillingness to accept kindness when it was offered-even the little we already know of her history, I think, contradicts that-but from the innate love of freedom that springs to life in every human soul worthy of the name. Bright and inviting looked the little school- room that morning; the sunlight poured its     58   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. radiance through the cheerful southern window, and flecked the white floor with spots of gold; the seats were so arranged as to let. the light fall, in the best manner possible, on each child while busy at its work; the fire sparkled on the hearth, and diffused a genial warmth throughout the apartment. A little table stood near one of the windows; on it was a work-basket, well filled, beside which lay the various little utensils required by the worker; a tiny silver thimble glittered in the sunbeams, like the smile of an old friend-an old friend it was, indeed, to Rose; I am afraid I will not be believed when I say, what is nevertheless true, that for seven years it had rendered good service to its young mis- tress in time of need.  A blithe little maiden of thirteen summers had Rose been, when her mother first slipped it on her finger, and a wonderful reformation had it wrought in her since the day she became its proud possessor. For, be it known, up to that date, Rose had been a most inveterate loser of thimbles; scarce a week passed that one had not been purchased to supply the lack left by the loss of its predecessor; and, to tell the truth, the young culprit was not over-much grieved at her repeated mishaps, hor over-anxious to prac- tice the art for which its aid was necessary. But when this shining, dainty, little implement b .'   /    ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     59 of industry became her own, both faults van- ished as if by magic; and she who mourns the loss of some brilliant gem could scarce have wept such genuine tears as would have dimmed the eyes of Rose, had any carelessness taken away from her this precious little emblem of womanly skill, endeared to her heart by its old associations and present use. Beside the table stood the chair, where, clad in a simple woolen dress, with no ornament save the brooch, the long-ago gift of her mother, fast- ening the snowy collar at her throat, sat the young teacher, whose presence lent its chief charm to the humble room. Her soft, brown hair was parted smoothly above the calm, fair brow, beneath which looked forth dark, liquid eyes of blue, whose pensive expression, slightly tinged with sadness, appealed irresistibly to every heart; surely, never child could enter there that would not soon grow to love and reverence that gentle incarnation of woman- tood. Rose Carleton was not beautiful; there are many -far more so who would fail to impress the beholder as did she; it was the pure thoughts and-impulses of her soul, her never faltering trust in heaven; mirrored in her face, which gave it its rare loveliness; her's was, indeed, "A countenance in which did meet Sweet records-promises as sweet." \,        60   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. But here come the children, flocking in, shy and awkward at their first introductIbn to their instructor-they will soon run to welcome her with affectionate joy; and the first day's duties begin-and Kate soon becomes a favorite among her playmates, while little Nora is caressed and loved by all; and so the first week passes, so busily and well, that almost before they are aware they have reached its close, and teacher and pupils separate for the Christmas holiday, equally pleased with their progress and each other-the children to exhibit to the admiring eyes of their parents and friends the proofs of their advancement, and Rose to prepare, with increased confidence and pleasure, for a contin- uance of her toil. "Though there are a few unruly spirits among my pupils, mamma," she said, "I like it better every day; it is not hard to control little girls by gentleness and firmness, and Kate and Nora have been so good, they have helped me a great deal. I only wish, now, that I could find some employment for the evening."   CHAPTER VI. She is a woman-one in whom The spring-time of her childish years Hath never lost its fresh'peffume, Though knowing well that life hath room For many blights and many tears. y. R. Lowell. CHRISTMAS-DAY had passed quiet- ly with the Carleton family, and the New-year was approaching. It was the'latter festival they had always been accustomed to regard, and Rose noticed, with sadness, that, as the olden holiday drew nearer and nearer, her mother made no effort toward any prepara- tion for its observance. Her own heart felt so acutely the grief that shadowed the hitherto cloudless, happiness of their home, that she shrank from any questioning for fear of reviving the bitterness of her mother's sorrow-for, ah, how many images of past delight did the mere mention of that day call up before her tear- stained vision!     62   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. . Once or twice, indeed, Rose fancied that her mother was on the point of speaking to her on the subject, but some hesitation caused her to desist; and it was not till after many fruitless conjectures that the true reason flashed upon her mind. Proud and happy had she felt when she laid the first money she had ever earned in her mother's hands; and proud and happy, but sad withal, had that mother felt as she received it. Yet it was in recalling her affectionate. words of encouragement that Rose first reached the solution of her difficulty. She saw that, independent of the pain her mother's loving heart must feel in confronting that first lonely New-year in. a strange land, she might naturally feel a delicate reluctance in spending the means obtained by her children's toil, on what most people would consider a silly indulgence for the little ones; nay, she might even fear that Rose and Frank themselves would so regard it, though they would never, for her sake, utter the thought aloud. Had there been no reason such as this, Mrs. Carleton's tender- ness for her children would have urged her to lighten their life with what little joy she could, to show that its duties still lay before them, and that the best and fondest tribute to the memory of their father would be to take it up again in the manner he would have appioved-not reject- \   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    63 ing the innocent diversions from daily toil that might chance to cross their path. Rose knew her mother's character too well to doubt this, and, grieved that any barrier, how- ever slight, should rise between them, resolved to speak to her without delay. Mr. Breton's store was gay with his little stock of holiday gifts, and she overheard little Nora sagely won- dering whether Santa Claus would bless their stockings that year, or not; and Kate, though five years older, seemed to share the anxiety of the little one. 'Rose's affection, half sisterly, half motherly, could not bear the idea of their disappointment; and that same day, while qui- etly sewing with her mother, she introduced the conversation thus: "Do you know, mamma," she .said, "that there are only two days till New-year's?" "Yes, my dear," replied Mrs. Carleton, in some surprise, "but I suppose we can hardly afford to keep the day now." "Oh, yes, mamma! It would be too bad to disappoint the children so. Dear little Nora! I heard her talking of it only yesterday. A few little gifts, costing but a trifle, would fill them with delight. Ah, I knew you would not refuse -if it was only to please me." "Indeed, my pet, I am only too glad to do so, if you wish it," replied her mother, embracing     "   ROSE CARLETONAS REIWARD. her; " but when I saw you and Frank so bravely taking up the task of supporting the family, it did not seem right to expend the means, so dearly earned, unnecessarily-at least, I could not propose it." "But it would be such a pity, mamma," said Rose, "for Kate and Nora to have no pleasant, childish memories of this New-year. I would be so sorry for them to connect the time when we first really began to work with nothing but stint and hardship. As for Frankand me, we are so proud and glad of our success, that we" need no other gift to brighten it for us; and we will not miss the small sum needful for the pur- pose."  "You are a good pleader," Mrs. Carleton re- plied, smiling, " but what you say is true. Con- tent yourself, Rose; it shall be done. My poor love," she added, sudden tears dimming her eyes, " we little thought, once, of spending New- year's thus." Rose silently caressed her, and for a short  time neither spoke. It was Mrs. Carleton whio resumed the conversation. "What do you think, Rose," she said, with her own sweet, motherly glance, "of our slip- ping out now, while the children are at their play, to see if Mr. Breton has any thing that would please them?" @       ,               ,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD:    65 ose heartily agreeing, they were soon ar- rayed in their outdoor garments, and left the house as noiselessly as possible. As they walked down the village street, it was easy to see that they were becoming well known and liked by the inhabitants, for many a pleasant "Good morning" greeted them, as one and another crossed their path; and now and then some of Rose's little pupils,'blushing and smiling, would meet their young teacher with such brightened faces when she spoke to them, as left no-doubt of the hold she had already gained on their af- fections. Mr. Breton himself came to attend them, as they entered the store, and the counter was soon gay with all the wonderful richestthat had been the e  nd the longing of all the y6ong citizen Green ollow for more than $lweek past Very different from these had been the ys which gladdened Rose's childhood. For an instant, as she stood there, lost in thought, shop and counter-nay, even the village itself- vahished from her view; she was back again in her own beautiful nursery in the old home; saw the bright -pictures that graced the walls-the pretty, dainty bed that stood ready for her rest -all her little treasures-her precious doll, its head adorned with curls soft and glossy as her own, clasped in her arms-her stockings, mys- 5     "   ROSE CARLETO"'S RElWAR'iD. terious objects of delight, hung up where she might catch a glimpse of the good saint coming  to fill them (though the soft blue eyes had al- ways closed in sleep before he blessed them with the sight)-her mother's tender voice and good- night kiss-ah! for an instant that seemed the real life, and this the dream. She was aroused from her reverie by Frank's voice exclaiming: "Where in the world are you wandering to, Rose? I don't believe you have heard one word I said." "So Mr. Breton has yielded *his place to you?" she replied, looking up, and for the first time noticing the absence of the store-keeper. "You have been dreaming, surely," said Frank, "not to have seen that before; but wait till your holiday is over, and I warrant those little rogues you teach will keep you wide awake enough." "This is what I have chosen, my dear," said Mrs. Carleton, interrupting their talk, " this little parcel of candies and these few toys. Have you taken any thing yet? I would like to be 'home soon." "I think I will take this little doll for Nora, mamma, and this basket for Kate. Wrap them up carefully, Frank. Now I am ready--oh, no, I forgot; just wait one moment, mamma;" andl,4   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     67 drawing her brother aside, she whispered, "Has it come yet, Frank?" "Not yet," was the reply, "but it will be time enough to-morrow."          Ao Rose looked slightly disappointed, as she turned to accompany her mother, but she said nothing. ,The children ran to meet them, on their re- turn. "We looked for you so long, mamma," cried Kate, half reproachfully; but Rose evaded their questions, and dexterously concealed her treas- ures, without exciting any suspicions as to where they had been. The day passed, as, usual, and New-year's- eve came. The snow was falling in light, feathery'flakes, and promised to continue-the morrow would be just such a one as all children love for their winter holiday. Nora had hung up her stockings in unquestioning childish faith that the morning would see them filled; and Kate, although she had long ago begun to doubt the truth of the ancient tradition, willingly fol- lowed her example. Their mother was prepar- ing them for their rest. "It is time my little girl was asleep," she said, as, after hearing their simple prayers, she lifted Nora into her warm little nesjt; "Santa Claus doesn't like to see children awake the night he     68   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. comes round; and my Nora and Kate have been so good, he will be sure to visit them this time." The poor little creature's hysterical laugh, as she clung to her mother's neck, gave token that even she, young as she was, comprehended something of the difference between this New- year and the last. A bright tear glistened on her fair curls, as her mother soothed her into quietness and rest; and long after the children were wrapped in peaceful slumbers she still sat beside them, till Rose stole'softly in and joined her vigil. Then, seated by the fire, hand in hand, in quiet converse of the past, mother and daughter watched out the lingering hours of the old year, until the hands of the clock, pointing in silence to the hour of one, warned them of the dawning of the new. What altering fortunes it might bring, they could not tell; they only knew that nothing, for good or ill, could change their earnest love for each other and their dear ones; that the benefi- cent Hand which had hitherto led their way was still their's to lean on; and with whispered words of trust and hope-uttered through gently-fall- ing tears that left no bitterness-and fond ca- resses, 'they at last lay down to rest, The morning broke radiantly-clear and bright-the air just cold enough to be bracing,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    69 while not a speck marred the beauty of the soft, white mantle that clothed the earth; and, with the first gleam of light, young eyes were eagerly exploring the corner where hung the coveted stockings, whose rounded proportions .showed temptingly to the view, and young ears waited impatiently for mamma's or sister's permission to arise. At last, when the children's small' stock of that virtue was almost exhausted, Rose entered the room. "A happy New-year, sweetest!" she said, bending. over Nora, while Kate leaned forward to share her caress; "ah, I see where you are looking; give sister one kiss, and then you shall have them. You are late this time, mamma," she added, laughing triumphantly, as her mother opened the door; "Nora gave me the first kiss, even before you!" "I am not jealous," was the smiling answer. "Besides, Nora was an unwitting traitor. But breakfast is waiting. I wish the children were dressed." The children, however, were too much ab- sorbed in their treasures, by this time, to heed such a call; and. their cries of "Oh, mamma, look at this!" and "Rose, is n't this pretty?" would have made you think that they verily be- lieved the ones whom they addressed had never seen those marvels before. tl     70   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "They are joined to their idols, mamma," said Rose, laughing. "I'm afraid we must let them alone," Frank's step and voice now sounded in the next room, and there was no alternative but to wrap Kate and Nora in warm shawls, and, allow- ing them to carry their riches with them, bring them thus to the breakfast table, where they as- sailed their brother with the same eager exclama- tiols they had hitherto expended on their mother and sister. Something lay on Mrs. Carleton's plate, and Rose and Frank exchanged glances of pleasant meaning as she took her seat. "What is this?" she asked, lifting it smilingly up; "a surprise for me?" "Yes, mamma,; that is what Frank and I thought would please you best." "And so it does, love; you could not have chosen a better." It was their first American newspaper; and, let me tell you, its arrival was no small event to that little household, which looked forward with delight, every week, to the day when it was due; and though, in after years, other and better pub- lications, perhaps, enriched their small library, they never forsook the companionship of this first friend of their exile, which had taught them to feel, in some degree, as children of the new soil.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     71\ And thus the morning passed, Frank's neces- sary absence at the store being the only draw- back to its pleasure; but they made what little cheerful preparation they could for his return; and Rose enjoyed to the full the last day of her holiday week. Tpere was, too, a new and unexpected pleasure awaiting thetn, of which they had never thought. "There will be fine sleighing to-morrow, wife, if this snow-fall keeps on," :said Farmer Lee, as he entered, that New-year's-eve, the large, cheerful kitchen, where his wife was preparing supper. "Will there?" she replied, looking up. "How Mary would have enjoyed it, if she had been at home!" "That she would," said her husband, with a moistened eye. "But I tell you what, Lucy, since we can not have her company, suppose we ask Miss Carleton (who called here the' other week) and her mother to take a sleigh-ride with us. I have not much work to do to-morrow, and can easily spare the time." "I am glad you thought of that, John; it will make the day not seem so lonely to us, and will please her. Poor thing! I thoughlt a pity of her, the day she called here; she looked so tired, and     72   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. was so disappointed when I said we had no chil- dren we could send to her school." "Mr. Breton tells me," said the farmer, "that she has succeeded very well. I suppose you know he has taken her brother into the store." "I am glad of it," answered his kind-hearted wife. "I am sure they are poor, though they say very little about it." "Well, I will call round in the morning," con- cluded her husband, " if it is a fair one, and see whether they will go. I hope they will. Some- how, she minds me of our Mary," and his rough face was lighted up with love for his absent child. They were a genial, warm-hearted pair as eveI breathed, this backwoods toiler and his wife; and when Rose first came across their path, they were more than usually open to kindly impres- sions. Their only daughter had been married a few months before, and had departed with her husband for a still more westerly clearing, ac- companied by her two-stalwart brothers, who wished to see their sister settled somewhat in her new home, and to share for a time in the more exciting life of those unpeopled districts. Sorely did the parents feel the separation from her who had been the delight and darling of the homestead, and lonely seemed the days after her departure. It was then, when their grief was   ROSE CARLETON'S RE WARD.    73  still fresh, that Rose entered on the scene, and in her sweet lowliness captivated their hearts. Though they could not help her directly with her school, they neglected not to render many a delicate little kindness, which the intuition of the true heart fails not to teach; and while they were growing to like the whole family, Rose, es- pecially, bid fair to become a great favorite. Breakfast was scarcely over; and Frank had just left for the store, when Farmer Lee, pursu- ing his kind intention of the previous night, knocked at the door of the Carletons' humble dwelling. Rose opened it, and asked him to enter. "It is hardly worth while," he answered, but did so, nevertheless ; taking a seat at her invita- tion, and setting the baskt he carried on the floor. Little Nora shyly id herself in the folds of her sister's gown, and the pretty face, peeping out now and then, riveted the visitor's attention. "Is that one of your little sisters, Miss Carle- ton?" he asked. "Yes, sir," Rose answered, smiling. "Come and speak to the gentleman, Nora." But Nora blushed, and did not move. The farmer drew a large rosy apple from his capacious pocket, and held it toward her; but even this had no effect, though a smile of delight broke over her face; so Rose took it for her. f     .r        '     74   ROSE CARLETON'S RE WARD. Then she asked Mr. Lee if he wished to see her mother; but he. said no, at least she need not disturb her, for it would do as well to tell his errand to herself, and accordingly did so. "It promises to be a fine evening," he said; "so wife and I thought perhaps you might enjoy a sleigh-ride; the roads will be broken by that time, and I would bring the sleigh round about an hour after dinner." "You are very kind, indeed, sir," said Rose, delight beaming in all her features; "it is a pleasure we have never enjoyed. I will go and bring my mother, for it is she who must decide." Nora was busy admiring her apple, and did not notice her sister's absence. When Rose re- turned, accompanied by her mother,.she found the little one established on the farmer's knee, who by some magic art had already cemented a firm friendship between them. He rose respect- fully on Mrs. Carleton's entrance, and repeated his request. "It is the first good fall of snow we have had this winter," he added; "and as I believe Miss Carleton's school opens again to-morrow, we thought that maybe there would not offer assfAir a chance again." "I thank you very much for your kindness, Mr. Lee," the mother replied; " and we will very gladly, indeed, accept it. We must soon learn to   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     75 love our new home, when we find such good neighbors." "Oh, it is but a trifle," he answered, rising to go; "it is we who will be glad of your company, for we are lonely enough just now. So it is all settled; and remember, Mrs. Carleton, to have these little ones ready, too; it will not do them any harm, and my sleigh is a large one." "You have forgotten your basket, sir," said Rose, hastening to lift it. "No, no," he answered, hurriedly; "I meant to leave it; there are a few little things in it wife sent for a New-year's gift;" and before Rose had time to thank him, or to open the door, he had done so himself, and was gone. You may be sure they lost no time in exam- ining the basket. Mrs. Carleton raised the lid, and there lay, plump and fair to view, the nicest turkey that ever delighted a housekeeper's eyes; a pumpkin, and a mince pie, the most tempting of their kind, and a quantity of apples and nuts completed its contents. "Oh, wasn't she generous, mamma!" cried Rose. "What a nice dinner we can have to surprise Frank with!" "She was, indeed," answered her mother, her heart thankful for this new token that their lines had fallen in pleasant places. \ It was no wonder that when Frank came     76   ROSE CARLETON'S .REWARD. home, at noon, he was struck with the expres- sion of delight and secrecy visible on every coun- tenance. Rose intercepted him on his way to the kitchen. "Just one moment, brother dear," she en- treated; "wait till I call you." And she has- tened to put the finishing touches to the table. "Why, what is this?" said Frank, in astonish- ment, when he obeyed the summons. "One wculd think, mother, that you had a magician's wand, or that some good fairy had blessed your wishes. Where in the world did you get such a dinner as this to grace the New-year?" "And so it was a good fairy to us, though not a very ethereal one," answered Rose, laughing, "that visited us in your absence. But the gifts do not end here; guess what follows." "Have a little mercy, Rose," her brother said; "I am too hungry; and mother has given me such a tempting 'Benjamin's portion,' that I would fain enjoy it, just now, rather than answer questions; so you must exercise a little clem- ency, and satisfy my curiosity without requiring that self-denial from me." "Well, I suppose I must," Rose answered, smiling. "It is something, then, that none of us ever enjoyed before, and that can only be enjoyed in winter." "Ah, I know now!"Frank interrupted, as the   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    " merry jingle of bells smote upon the air, and the children rushed to the window to behold, for the twentieth time that day, what was such a beauti- ful and novel sight to them-"I know it now, Rose; it is a sleigh-ride; but who is the good fairy?" "You remember that Mr. Lee and his wife, who received me so kindly when I was trying to get up my school, and who have called here once or twice since? It is they who have done it all. You know I always liked them, and praised them from the first." "They deserved it," answered Frank; "it is not every one who would be so good-natured. Coax Mr. Lee to drive past the store door, Rose, so that I can see you all." "Ah, that is true, Frank," said his mother, regretfully. "I wonder I did not think of it before; you can not go with us!" "What a pity! I am so' sorry!" added Rose, the brightness dying out of her face at once, as half the pleasure she had anticipated slipped from her grasp. "Come, come!" cried Frank, with affectionate gayety; "do n't look so dreadfully sober, Rose; one would think, from your disconsolate face, that some accident had happened to me. You know Mr. Breton owns a sleigh, and who can tell but my turn may come next? So all of you     78   ROSE CARLETOy'S RE WARD. be sure to accept Mr. Lee's kindness; and, mother, dearest, don't let my absence spoil what he meant to be so pleasant. Remember, every one will be held guilty of, high treason that does n't show a smiling face when you pass the store." Then, as it drew near the time when he must leave, he leaned down and kissed his mother's lips and forehead; then, putting on his cap, he gave Rose a playful good-by, tossed little Nora up in the air till she laughed with delight, opened the door, and departed. An hour later, the sleigh stopped before the house, and Farmer Lee, getting out, carried the little girls over the snowy path, and delivered them into the gentle custody of his wife.; then assisted Mrs. Carleton and Rose to their seats, and, taking his own, touched the horses lightly with his whip, and they sped merrily from the door. Down the long village street, that had looked so desolate to Rose and Frank the night of their arrival, but now seemed bright and cheerful; the children nestled cosily and safely in the hay, and Mrs. Lee talking and laughing with Rose and her mother; while now and then some merry sleighful, not more happy than themselves, darted past, challenging them to a race; and so on, till they reached Mr, Breton's store, when   Face p'age 78.       ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    79 the farmer reined in his horses, and again got out. Frank's face was not visible at door or win- dow, and the disappointment wgas great; but just as they were giving up all hope of seeing him, Mr. Lee appeared again with the truant by hi. side, and who, to their wonder and delight, mounted to share his seat. "Oh, how good you are!"Rose cried, impul- sively, laying her hand on the farmer's arm, for she made no doubt that this new surprise was owing to him. "How did you contrive to bring him?" "There was, not much doing in the store," he replied, pleased with her praise; "and Mr. Breton thought, with me, that it was a pity, when your brother could so easily be spared, for him not to accompany us, so he readily consented." "Now I hope you are content, mother," Frank said, smilingly, turning round to speak to her. Her beaming face was sufficient answer. And now, with redoubled pleasure, they again set forth. The village was soon cleared, and they were out on the highway leading to the great city, so many miles distant; the curling smoke from the chimneys of the scattered farm-houses, and the snow-clad hills vhich hemmed in the little valley, alone varying the wide, level expanse through which the road lay. Oh! with what     80   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. royal beauty did the sunlight clothe the scene, reflected back in a thousand sparkling rays from the pure, white surface, and stealing lovingly into the sad heart, wiling it away from care and sorrow. Rose soon left her mother and Mrs. Lee to carry on the conversation without her aid, and joined the children in their enthusiastic delight. Mrs. Carleton felt her own youth renewed as she gazed on the softly glowing cheek, to which the clear, fresh air lent a richer bloom, and the radi- ant eyes, eloquent with sisterly affection; and surely maternal pride, in such a daughter, might well be forgiven. While Mrs. Lee lived over again kindred excursions, when her own beloved child had been the admiration of every eye, Frank and Mr. Lee were deep in a conversation on farming, too much absorbed to note the long distance they had by this time traversed, And it was not till roused by a gentle hint from his wife, that Mr. Lee at last turned his horses toward home. The evening shadows were beginning to gather, and the glimmering lights from the windows shone cheerfully through the gloom, when they regained the village, and stopped at the farmer's door, "But you are going to drive us home, aren't you, Mr. Lee?" said Rose, as ;she noticed him getting out of the sleigh.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    81 "Not till you have taken some supper with us, my dear," replied his wife, smiling. "Your house' is maybe cold, while one of the neighbor's daugh- ters has kept in my fires and prepared the supper; it will be ready in a few minutes; and you will not refuse, Mrs. Carleton, surely, to complete our pleasant evening?" Befdre they had time to accept or decline, her husband had lifted Kate and Nora to the door- way, and there was no choice left but to follow them into the warm, well-lighted, little sitting- room; from which, when they were disrobed of their wrappings, their hostess ushered them into the heartsome kitchen, where a plentiful table. awaited their coming. What merry chatter enlivened the repast; how even Kate and Nora forgot their shyness beneath the genial influence, and Rose watched with delight something of the olden gayety appear again in her mother's countenance; how swiftly sped the hour after tea, when, gathered round the hearth, they whiled away the time with the basket of nuts and apples Mrs. Lee placed upon the table, while her husband amused them by the stories of his early adventures in the west- ern wilds ;-all this needs not to be told, for the imagination is quick to entertain such pleasant, homely scenes.  Frank had coaxed the house key from Rose, 6     82   ROSE CARLETON',S REFWARD. and quietly disappeared from the company about half an hour before it was time to return; his object was apparent when the rest followed him, for a bright fire illumined Mrs. Carleton's room, and seemed doubly pleasant from the dark con- trast they had expected. His mother's affec- tionate glance, and the whispered thanks of Rose, were more than recompense for his trou- ble. So, wearied out with their day's frolic, they lingered but to join in their mother's simple prayer, and bidding each other a loving "good- night," were soon wrapped in profound slumbers. Ah, I would that some, who have far greater. means for so doing than Farmer Lee andf his wife, did but even partially follow his example! Here was a whole family brightened and re- freshed in spirit by these simple acts of hospi-. tality and kindness, and their hearts made warm by the remembrance for months to come. And how trifling, how very trifling the cost, in com-, parison to the good wrought! Why, one would think that mere humanity would prompt to such deeds, without any aid from the religion that en- joins "to visit the widow and the fatherless." I suspect that Farmer Lee would have opened his honest eyes in amazement, if any one had attributed this act to his piety, true Christian though he was; yet who can doubt but the Divine approvaj recorded on high, "Inasmuch as .   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     83 Iye did it unto one of the least of these, my little ones, ye did it unto me?"For the truest re- ligion is ever that which blends so deeply with the human nature, that lookers on can scarcely distinguish where the one ends and the other begins, save that men, "marveling, take knowl- edge" of such an one, "that he has been with Jesus." But it may be thought I have lingered too long over the events of that first winter, though it seemed necessary to give some idea of the peo- ple in the midst of whom the emigrant family's lot was cast. We bid it adieu now; this toil- some but happy life was soon to be interrupted in a manner they little expected.     CHAPTER VII. This day, be bread and peace my lot; All else beneath the sun, Thou know'st if best bestowed or not, And let thy will be done. Pope. HE winter is past, the snow is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come," and the woods around Green Hollow are robed again in verdant garbs of summer beauty. The place deserved its name. If weary of the dust and tumult of the street, eye and heart alike found relief in fair, green meadows, starry with wild flowers, stretching far away; and in the soft lights and shadows of the forest paths, beside which came leaping down the merry mountain brook, cooling the heated sum- mer air, and hurrying on to join the river far below. On the green slopes, reaching downward to (84)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.      85 the village, what joyous romps were held by the children when the day's heat was over! what sweet, glad voices rang through the air! what innocent delight there found expression! And with the dawning of this spring-tide, two little strangers joined the group; two new voices lent added melody to the laughter; two more pairs of little feet ran lightly over the green ; the branches of the trees waved their shadows over two bright, unfamiliar heads; for Rose watched, with a sister's love and pride, Kate and Nora joining in the gambols of their playmates, and already winning honorable rank among them; though, of course, there were not wanting here, as elsewhere, the envious few who resented their beauty and goodness. They were but few, how- ever; for, understanding nothing of such feel- ings, the little new comers went forward uncon- scious of their existence, and received from most of their companions warm welcome. No regrets for the old home and old friends clouded their happy vision. What if the house was poor, the furniture scant? what if their little fingers were trained to unaccustomed toils? did not the fresh, free wind nerve to activity? did not the skies, blue and brilliant, still bend above them, and the sunshine glorify their poor abode? and was not work but the pure tonic, giving appetite for their simple fare; a wholesome re-     86   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. straint, soon over, and only lending enjoyment new zest? What was wealth to them, with the jubilant blood of childhood pulsing in their veins, and all its rose-hued hopes before them, and Love's sheltering arms around them? Only when a shade of sadness passed over their mother's face, or the strange, new thoughtful- ness of Rose, or Frank's discussions of ways and means, riveted their attention, did the past recur to them with a vague feeling that some shadow thrown by it had caused the change; but no regretful longing crossed their mind, save when the image of their father came back, clear and vivid even to their young memory. Rose had already accompanied her pupils on a woodland excursion; the second time she in-. duced her mother to go also, and a delightful afternoon it was which they thus spent. While the children romped through the shady forest aisles, Rose and her mother sauntered slowly to and fro, recalling summers passed amid other scenes, till the tired players, gathering near, begged for a story while they rested; and Rose would smilingly sit down by her mother's side, with the eager group ranged in a half circle be- fore them. Then, either she or Mrs. Carleton took up the tale, and held their listeners in breathless attention; many a useful lesson was embodied in these simple recitals-all the better   ROSE CARLETONV'S RETWARD.   87 remembered that the story pleased as well as instructed. From such excursions mother and daughter returned with cleared brows and light- ened hearts-better fitted to take up again "the burden and the weariness of life." But such pleasures were rare; it was not from sources like this they drew chief help and comfort. The truth and love of home were, far above any out- ward praise or consolation, the inspiration from which sprang energy and hope; and in their hearts, known only to human ken by the fresh 9 beauty it gave to their daily life, were the faith, and hope, and love of heaven-" a well of water springing up unto everlasting life." May had almost passed, and the little garden had been brought into a good degree of order; Frank worked diligently 'there in the early morning hours, and Rose and the children were ready and helpful assistants ; the neglected spot had never borne so thrifty an aspect, under any former tenant; and the young workers often listened, with brightening eyes, to the favorable comments of the passers-by. The trees from which Rose had hoped so much seemed likely to fulfill her expectations, for a shower of apple and peach blossoms perfumed the air, and shook their fragrant petals at the window of her little attic room-strewing the floor with rosy drifts, when the soft spring wind tossed the branches.     88   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. The bloom of health glowed on the cheeks of each member of the little household; the last lingering traces of Mrs. Carleton's illness had long since disappeared, and all their outward circumstances seemed prosperous and happy. "Had not difficulties vanished wondrously from their pathway?"Rose asked herself, as she toiled in the garden through the cool of the evening-" and what cause had she for aught but thankfulness?" Yet the questioning itself was token that all was not unclouded peace; and, much as she might strive to veil the truth from her own eyes, she felt a growing disquietude and, alarm-that she would not for worlds have hinted to her mother-on a subject near to all their hearts; fain to persuade herself that it was but the re- sult of her own anxious fancy. Yet the fancy, if it were such, was strangely obstinate, for it grew on her day by day; and no reasoning could dispel the idea, which hung like a heavy mist before her mind-shutting away from it all out- ward sunshine-that Frank was already grow- ing weary of the pursuit he had adopted; that the irksome restraint he had felt in it from the first was fast becoming intolerable, and that he would scarcely fail to take advantage of any opportunity of escape from it which might offer. What that opportunity could be was not, indeed,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     89 so clearly defined to her thought, but she felt a vague fear, hardly acknowledged, that it might, in some way, involve separation; and to one feel- ing still lonely and scarce assured in a strange land, separation sounded like a sentence of death. But she' had something more tangible than her thoughts on which 'to found this dread: Frank had, true to his old intention, as soon as the spring opened, endeavored to obtain employ- ment with a farmer; but most of those living near Green Hollow had either grown sons capa- ble of performing all needful labbr, unless, per- haps,: in the hurry of harvest, or relatives whom they wished to befriend; the former was the case with Mr. Lee, who, having formed a high opinion of Frank's worth and probity, would otherwise have been more. than willing to render him assistance; but though his generosity made many people, better off, judge to the contrary, the good farmer was far from being rich, and could not rightly have afforded to obtain extra help, when his own family was equal to the task. Then there were others who naturally preferred employing their own countrymen, with whom they felt more companionship, and who were, of course, better versed in their ways of working. There was, too, maybe, a concealed feeling that Frank might be too much of a gentleman to be of any great use to them. Ah! they little un-     90   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. derstood that, manly spirit, its pure, fresh im- pulses still strong as at first, who reasoned thus. Was not honest toil a far higher nobility in his eyes, than any mere pride of wealth or lineage- too often tarnished by meanness and deceit? He, who had seen his father's death, and his N.  family's ruin, wrought by the reckless ambition of one who leaned on his old descent and means, inherited or acquired, as his chief claims to re- spect,-he was not likely to bow down and do them reverence. "If I had but the chance," said Frank, half bitterly, "I could soon prove to them that my work would be equal to theirs." "And be sick with fever in a month!" his mother replied; "and so, perhaps, lose the whole summer. Try and be content, my dear; the work you wish for would be much more se- vere than any you were used to at home; and it is quite a different thing from working on your own farm, to be employed as a hand on another's. Then the climate is hard enough on us as it is, and I think it is quite as well you should not expose yourself too freely, until you have be- come more accustomed to it; besides; you are young, and can well afford to wait." But though he made no answer, Frank was not satisfied; for what boy ever thinks he can not work as well as another?   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    91 There was, lowever, an insuperable objection which made him relinquish his project much readier than any argument could have done; the pay he would have received in this new em- ployment-even the utmost any were willing to give-was so much below what he already had, that it would have been sheer folly, in their straitened circumstances, to make the exchange. But though such was the case in Green Hollow, was tlhat any reason why he should not try his fortune beyond its narrow limits? How could he ever hope to succeed if he regarded himself as bound irrevocably to fix his lot there? It was in such a mood that he entered the garden one evening in quest of Rose. He had come to tea a little earlier than was his wont, and, ad it was not quite ready, resolved to take advantage of this opportunity to hold a conver- sation he had long desired. Nora was playing be- fore thie'front door, Kate was helping her mother, and the sole occupants of the garden were him- self and Rose. "Now, or never!" was his men- tal exclamation, as he walked toward the clump of bushes, behind which she was busily work- ing; but his movements were flurried and hesi- tating, as of one whose mind is ill at ease; and, in truth, he knew right well that what he pur- posed saying must give her pain. "It will soon be over, though," he mused;     92   ROSE CARLETOIN'S REWARD. "and when I come back from my wandering, an independent man, there will be more than com- pensation in release from all this care and drudgery." She was too much absorbed in her work to hear his approaching footsteps; and for a few moments, he stood silently watching her, while she toiled on, unconscious of his presence; but the sight awakened in his breast far different emotions from those she would have wished to kindle there. He loved his sister dearly; her goodness and beauty, her cheerfulness in as- suming her part in their new life, inspired him with a certain degree of reverence; yet, even now, when he saw her fulfilling one of the most Viw   toilsome conditions of that life, he felt no de- i   sire to emulate her example. It might be all very well for a time-it was a beautiful instance of sisterly and daughterly affection, no doubt; but was it not his part to raise her, and all of them, from the necessity of such service? He did&,not stop to consider how much of self-con- fidence might lie in such a reflection; or, that. even the surest and safest way of reaching the end he sought was to follow in her footsteps- that "patient continuance in well doing" could scarcely fail to be rewarded witt an honest com- petence-happiest earthly lot; he only felt an eager longing to lift the load he found so heavy   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    93 from his shoulders and theirs; that the months were slipping past with no such prospect in view, if he did not inaugurate some change himself, and, with his usual impulsiveness, re- solved to do so-though he would have found it rather difficult to give any definite idea of his future course. And yet, six months ago he would have hailed his present situation with delight; but was it any reason not to try to do better, because he had already done well? "Only," whispered a low voice, faintly heard amid the sophistries with which he hushed its pleadings, "it should make you not too rash in seeking for a change, especially when that change entails sorrow and separation'on those you hold dear."'  "It will all be forgotten," was his silent an- swer, recurring to the old no-argument, "when I return to them, bringing means and happiness with me;" and, rousing from his reverie, he at last broke the stillness: "Were you so much taken up with your Vwork, Rose, as not to have seen me all this long time?" "O Frank! how you startled me!" she ex- claimed, rising, and letting the implement she was using fall from her hand. "Why, how cautiously you must have walked-I did not hear a sound until you spoke."     "   tOSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "Well, take a little rest now," he answered, smiling; "walk up and down this path with me till mamma calls us to tea-I want to talk with you. Why, this hand is trembling yet! I am sorry I frightened you so-I did not in- tend it." She did, indeed, tremble, though she smiled in return, but less with the sudden surprise than with a prophetic heart-thrill that warned her but too truly of what the conversation was to be. "It was only my own foolishness that made me start so," she replied; "see, I am quite still now. What was it you were going to tell me?" "I do not know whether you have suspected any thing of it or not, Rose," Frank began, draw- ing her arm through his; " but, at any rate, I am almost sure you will object at first; only wait, though, till I give you my reasons, and you may come to agree with me." He went on rapidly, as if glad of having been able to make a beginning, and did not notice the look of painful anticipation in the fond eyes lifted to his face. "You know how disappointed I have been in getting the work I wished for here; and even could I, the miserable pay given is a bar to it at once; neither is there any likelihood of its being better for years to come. Now, you are getting   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    95 on beautifully with your school, you have even found employment for the evening; and, as we are pretty well fixed here, I think it is better for you, and mother, and the children, to stay here-but as for me, it does seem like nothing but wasting precious time for me to continue at my present work, disliking it as I do; if I went away to some wider field, I would hope to succeed better." "But to leave us!" interrupted Rose. "Oh! brother, think what you are saying!" "The separation would not be long, dear sis- ter; I could write, and might even come often to see you; and how delightful it would be to return in a few years able to provide for you all!" "But what if you did not succeed?" "And what great success can await me here?" he replied, a little vexed; "clerk in a paltry country store-at wages which do, indeed, fur- nish food and clothes, but furnish nothing more! Mother says I am young, and can afford to wait -and so I could, was I at any thing that held hope of progress; yet, admitting that I am so young, a few years now must greatly help to settle my future destiny; and what a life a country store-keeper's would be to look forward to, should I even attain to the height of owning a store myself! My dear Rose, you are usually  ,     96   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. clear-sighted; I wonder you can not see, your-, self, that even supposing I clung to the calling I am in at present, an insignificant village like this is no place to rise to any eminence in such a pursuit. Now, what I would like to do, if I. can only get your and mother's consent, is to go where there are wealthy farmers, able to af- ford good wages, and to employ plenty of la- borers; in such a place I might rise to be head gardener, or overseer of a farm; and, after lay-  ing up some money, could come back and buy a few acres here, where we would all live hap- pily together. Or, failing in this, I might try my luck in some of the large cities, as assist- ant in a store; in any case, it does seem to me that I would be in a fairer way of bettering my prospects than where I am." ^    "I only want you to act for the best, dearest Frank," Rose answered, her voice low and fal- tering, "and if your leaving us would really be thatY I will not oppose it; but it does not seem so clear to me as it does to you. I feel a sort of attachment for this place; it was dear papa's choice; and, then, most of the people have been very kind." "But all the kindness they can show is not. going to advance us in the world," answered Frank. "Still, brother, remember it is something, not /   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    97 to be despised, that we have already gained on their esteem and confidence. If you go to a new place, that will all have to be accomplished over again; besides, it is much harder to estab- lish a good character in a large town, where you are apt to be overlooked in the crowd, and must remain a stranger to most of the inhabitants, than in a village like this, where every one is well known." "But what is the practical good of possessing such a character, unless you reap some material benefit from it?" "And are we not doing so, now? Oh, Frank, I entreat of you, do not act rashly! Has not Heaven's blessing seemed to rest upon us here, from the first? How readily we obtained em- ployment; and should we show impatience at not being able to accomplish more?  Dear brother, think what bitter poverty stared us in the face, and now we meet the morrow without dread; we are all in good health; we have a comfortable home-humble, to be sure, but still comfortable; you and I are young and strong. If the first half year has done all this, why should .we be restless or despairing?" "I am not despairing, Rose," said' Prank, "though I may be restless; but I would like the next year to be better than the last; and the third, better still." 7     98   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "And why should not the success of the first be a prophecy for the rest?" she replied. "Oh, believe me," she continued, and now her voice was earnest in its pleading-" believe me, it is not to any rapid elevation we must look for the bettering of our fortunes, but to quiet, patient, persevering effort; that is the course that will bring the surest, sweetest reward, at last. Above all, it is the path on which we can feel most sure God's blessing will rest; and per- haps I am wrong, but I can not help feeling as if He had pointed out this place for our abode, by the ready assistance we have met with in our need." "Hush, darling, hush! we will not speak any more of it now," said her brother, drawing her to him in a closer embrace, for her tears were beginning to fall. "Only one other word, dear Frank," she re- plied, while a smile broke through the crystal rain-" you know, according to the old libel, I, as a woman, am entitled to the last-and then I have done. Is it not worth while, even suppos- ing that change would hasten your object, to be content that it should be delayed for a few years, when that delay gives us the delight of each other's presence? You know. that, to mamma, our companionship is infinitely more than lands or money; and what grief this separation would   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    99 cause her! though I am, sure she will set her own wishes aside in advising you what to do. I would like you to feel that I do not do you in- justice, Frank, in this. I know it is, maybe, harder for you than for me to bear suspense, or to be content to work patiently, and wait for the reward, instead of seeking it. And if your hopes were certain to be fulfilled, it might be better- I suppose it would-to do as you propose; but as long as equal arguments weigh on either side, I would incline to continue where I first began. Yet, maybe you are right; it is mamma who must decide the point, after all; and, till we know what she thinks, I would not be positive, either for or against. Still I can not help feel- ing that the best way is to take no immediate action, but wait for another half year, at least; we will be better able to judge then as to the wisdom of changing."  "Well, well, Rose," said Frank, affectionately, and feeling relieved that the subject had been introduced at all, "I will think of what you say. I have not spoken to mamma yet, but I intend to, soon; I will wait till some time when you are with herd" "There is Kate calling to us," interrupted Rose; "I suppose tea is ready; we must not keep them waiting;" and, without exchanging further words, they entered the house.     I00  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Almost a week passed before Frank resumed the subject of the conversation just related; Rose was even beginning to hope that her argu- ments had made a permanent impression on his mind, and that his silence was owing to some alteration, or, at least, hesitation in his purpose. But she was mistaken; what she had said had, indeed, for a time, partially disturbed the current of his thought, but it soon flowed back into its old channel; and the day whose morning found him half convinced of the truth of her reason- ing, found him in the evening, when wearied with toil, established anew in his own opinions. Rose had delayed imparting their talk'in the garden to her mother-at first, from reluctance to pain her, and afterward, in the hope that it might prove unnecessary. But Mrs. Carleton, though saying nothing, had not been unobserv- ant, and was fully aware of the state of Frank's mind before he uttered a word to her on the subject. Indeed, she would, long ere this, have invited his confidence, and canvassed the matter with him and Rose, had not the same feelings influenced her in regard to Rose that had de- terred Rose herself from speaking. So, when the dreaded day at last came on which Frank spoke unreservedly of his wishes, mother and daughter felt a mutual relief in finding that the disclosure was not unanticipated by either.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    101 Frank's arguments on this occasion were much the same as on the former, except to add that they need not feel alarmed at his relin- quishing his present situation, as he knew that Mr. Breton would hold it open for him, if he should wish to return after a few months. Mrs. Carleton, while agreeing with her daughter's view of the case, did not oppose the plan so much as Rose had expected; nor was it any wonder that she acted as she did, when she re- flected that Frank was rapidly attaining to man's estate, and while she could not avoid thinking her own way the best at present, the end might prove it otherwise; but at any rate, whether fortunate or unfortunate in its final issue, there could be no doubt that it would be much wiser to allow him to make the trial, than for him to wear out year after year in discontent at home. "There is but one thing which I fear, my dear Frank, in giving my consent," she said. "I know that, if you succeed, your first thought and wish will be for us, and that you would hasten with loving eagerness to return and share your good fortune with us. What I fear is the effect of your failure; in that event, I foresee how difficult it will be for you to reconcile your- self to a return; even partial success might not content; and you would be so apt to go on struggling to attain something higher, instead     102  ROSE CARLETON'S RE WARD. of admitting that the best had been done, and that all that remained now was to rejoin us here and take up again, with as cheerful a spirit as possible, the best pursuit that might offer. Oh, my dearest! do you wonder that, knowing, as I do, your high hopes and impulsive nature, I should fear you could never bear the idea of ac- cepting such an end; and that year after year, as it passed away, would still find your place at home vacant-till, perhaps-perhaps "-and her lips quivered-" my eyes might never see you more!" "Dear mother!"Frank answered, moved by her appeal, and embracing her affectionately, "believe me, your fears are vain; but you may, if you like, assure yourself against them; I only want to make 'a fair trial of what I propose; suppose you bind me by a promise to return in five years from now and take up again my life with you, whether I have succeeded or not. That length of time ought to be a sufficient test of the likelihood of success; or, who can tell but I may be coming to take you all to live with me!" and he looked at Rose with his old mis- chievous smile. "Would such a promise con- tent you?" "It would help to, at least," replied his mother, "but do not give it rashly. After all, a firm pur- pose to do right is the surest dependence."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I03 "And are you7 then, quite resolved to leave us, brother-and for such a long, long time?" said Rose, sadly. "I did not mean, of course, Rose, that I would certainly be absent so long," Frank an- swered; "I simply put that as the utmost limit I wished to have; and I might often make visits home before deciding on a definite return." "Well, Frank," said Mrs. Carleton, conclud- ing the conversation, "I do not withhold my consent, if you continue in your present mood; all I ask is, that you consider it seriously once more; and, oh," she added, in a lower and more earnest tone, "do not fail to seek guidance from Above." "Ah, Rose," she said, when he had left the room, "my heart fails me at the thought of his going forth alone, with none of the safeguards or comforts of home around him- he who has never known the lack of a mother's or a sister's love! Yet I can not see how I could have acted differently." "No, no, deat mamma," said Rose, hastening to comfort her, though'her own tears fell, "I am sure you have done quite right; and we can not tell how it may turn out-let us hope for the best." Of course, Frank's determination proved un- alterable, and, as there was no use in delaying     104  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. his departure when it was once agreed to, Mrs. Carleton and Rose set about preparing his wardrobe, that it might be as well supplied and in as perfect order as possible, for he was not likely to be able to avail himself of such willing service soon again. Never had the quiet beauty of Rose's character shone forth so clearly as now; no weak lamentations or upbraidings, no useless ill auguries of the future marred the last days Frank spent at home. As she had prayed that they might be guided aright; as she had not leaned on any human judgment, so apt to err, in the turmoil in which it must at once act and pass sentence on action; as she felt-oh, how deeply and how truly!-that- "We see not, know not; all our way Is night; with Thee alone is day;" and trusted all that she held dear in His keep- ing, without whose care not even a sparrow falls to the ground; so, with a child's humbleness and docility, did she accept, without further murmuring, the course His providence had marked for her to follow. Oh, how little is such a disposition understood-how few copy the ex- ample! It was by no means an inert yielding to circumstances that constituted Rose Carle- ton's unfeigned humility; she thought rightly that, as far as possible, we should control cir-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.      105 cumstances, instead of being their slave; but when once any action became unavoidable, when she had exerted whatever influence she pos- sessed for what she believed to be best at the time, and it still confronted her, steadfast as ever in its demands, then she thought it her duty to accept, unless it entailed moral wrong-doing. And even should the result prove unfortunate, the same principle taught her to accept failure without bitterness of spirit, assured that there was some good reason for the disappointment. Nay, when she htd committed aught that her conscience accused as sin, she endeavored-ad- mitting all the fault-to yet make it the step- ping-stone to future virtues.* And perhaps this is the greatest trial-the surest test of our humility, after all-to be able to acknowledge, in lowliness of spirit, that we have, indeed, done the wrong-that we may never, perhaps be permitted to repair it-and yet to look forward with true courage to the future- "Nor deem the IRREVOCABLE past, As wholly wasted, wholly vain, If, rising on its wrecks, at last To something nobler we attain." It was in this very quality that Frank was *This idea is beautifully embodied in Longfellow's poem entitled, The Ladder of St. Augustine.     106  ROSE CARLETON'S RE WARD. lacking; hence his impatience at not succeeding in a degree commensurate with his wishes-his inability to accept his present station as the ul- timatum, though it were only for a time-and his consequent readiness to desert what he had already obtained in the hope of something better. Need it be said how, deeper than ever, Rose shrined herself in his heart by her beautiful con- duct during those parting days? The cheerful alacrity with which she entered into his plans; the bright face with which she ever endeavored to meet him; the delicate intuition which taught her to work on his outfit, just so much in his presence as would show that she was interested, but not oppressed, that the last picture in his mind of home might be ever pleasant to look upon; this, and his mother's loving words, her gentle warnings and advice-the example she had ever set her children of regard for right and truth-all were safeguards to his soul, potent to preserve it from each polluting in- fluence. But the days slipped swiftly by, and the hour of actual separation came. Ah, however each had imagined hitherto that they had anticipated the pain it brought, they realized now how far short they had fallen of the true estimate! If there was the glisten of tears on Frank's face as   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    107 he listened to his mother's broken, heart-felt prayer that morning, it was honor rather than disgrace to his boyhood. And when she strained him to her heart, in all the anguish and the love of a last embrace-when her blessing fell upon his head, what wonder that his own voice trem- bled while he promised again and again to be faithful to all she enjoined. And then Rose claimed a kiss, though she would not say good-by yet, for she meant to walk with him to the stage-office, she said; and the children clung around him, fond and eager-little Nora understanding nothing, but that "Brother Frank" was going away, and coaxing him, in baby phrases, to soon come back; and he kissed her velvet cheek, and, lifting her in his arms, ran a race with her down the garden path, while she sat, well pleased, in state upon his shoulder; then, giving her to his mother, he and Rose, after more last adieus, left the house together, turning often to wave farewell to the little group in the doorway-to catch one more glimpse of the dear faces, where smiles and tears were struggling for the mastery-until they had turned the corner of the street and were hidden from sight. It was one of the loveliest of June mornings- so early that the usual stir in the village had scarce begun, and none but a few hastening to     108  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. the same destination as themselves crossed. their path; the twitter of birds came faintly from the woodland, blent with the splash and murmur of the brook; the dew still glistened in pearly drops upon the leaves, and the calm beauty of the scene fell like a benediction upon their troubled spirits, imparting to them something of its own peace. Few words had been spoken till they reached the office, and found the stage already at the door, most of the passengers having taken their seats; then Frank drew Rose aside. "Good-by, sweet sister!" he said, kissing her tenderly. "Do not grieve; we will soon meet again." "Oh, I hope so! I hope so!" she cried, cling- ing closer to him; " and write soon, dear Frank; write very soon! You know how anxious we will be until we hear from you." "I will! I will!" he answered. "And now I must go." He sprang nimbly to his place, and the coach started. Rose followed it with her eyes till the winding road hid it from her view, and with its disap- pearance a great shadow fell, for her, on the brightness of the summer morning-on the animated bustle which the village street was by this time beginning to present-on the duties of the day which lay before her, duties   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    109 she had once encountered with a light, step and happy heart-and drawing down her veil to hide the tears that could no longer be re- strained, she hastened homeward. i^ Is     CHAPTER VIII. The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers, Little we see in nature that is ours; 'We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! Wordsworth. OR a long time after the stage had left the village, Frank sat wrapped in his own meditations, quite oblivious of his fellow-passengers and the scenery through which the road lay. Now that his departure from Green Hollow was actually accomplished, he felt somewhat at a loss what course to pursue-whether to travel direct to the city, or stop for awhile at some of the in- termediate stations along the road. He was still debating this point, when a middle-aged man who sat beside him, and who had been observ- ing him for some time with interest, turned to answer a question addressed to him by another passenger, who seemed to be an acquaintance. (IIo)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    III "Yes," he was saying, "I was quite vexed at losing so good a hand; not but that there are plenty willing to supply his place, but he was so trustworthy." "He will be certain to succeed on a farm of his own," replied the other; "so much energy can not fail." Frank had been all attention from the first word spoken. Might not there be an opening here for him? At any rate, he would try. "Are you a farmer, sir?" he said, respectfully, addressing the first speaker. The man answered in the affirmative, adding that his place adjoined  a town lying some miles farther east, giving the name. "But why do you ask?" he continued. "I am anxious to obtain employment on a farm," Frank'explained, "if the wages given were any way fair; and overhearing you speak of hav- ing lost a hand, thought that, perhaps, you might not-" "Object to finding another?" interrupted his listener, good-naturedly. "Well, neither I would, if he was a smart one; but you do not look fit for much hardship." Frank colored with vexation at meeting the old difficulty so soon again. "It is not always those who look strongest who work best," he said, a little coldly.     "2  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. The farmer looked at him, a glimmer of amuse- ment blent with his glance. "That is true," he answered. "Come, young- ster! do not be offended because I have seemed to underrate you; we may come to terms yet. Where do you live?" Frank's countenance brightened at the con- cluding words, and he proceeded to give a brief outline of his history. His new friend listened attentively, and seemed pleased. "Well," he said, at the close, "I certainly want a laborer now, and as you seem so willing, you can come and try it for awhile, if you like." The remuneration he offered was considerably higher than any given at Green Hollow; indeed, Frank would lose nothing, in that direction, by changing his place as Mr. Breton's clerk for this, and he gladly accepted the proposal. It was late in the afternoon of the following day when they arrived at Mr. Ellis's farm; and though wearied with his journey, for they had traveled all night, Frank could not help being struck by the aspect of the place, so different from what he had expected. The house was a large, rambling, country one, painted red; and although it gave evidence that the owner enjoyed the comforts of life, it certainly did not afford any glimpse of thought for beauty or pleasure. Rich fields of grain stretched away on every   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    113 side, and a fine orchard, loaded with the promise of fruit to come, could be seen from the entrance to the house; but not a tree cast its welcome shadow before the door, to relieve the intensity of the sun's rays, reflected back with double force from the oft-trodden paths leading through the yard. A girl with bare head was toiling up the, hot steps of the porch, with a bucket of water, drawn from the well, that lay half the length of the area from the kitchen door. It was evident that the sole aim of the owners was to accumulate money, without any regard to brightening or making convenient their daily life; never reflecting that when their object would be accomplished, the best part of their existence would have vanished in the struggle. Frank could not avoid drawing a comparison, silently, between this and his father's beautiful homestead, where every contrivance for mitigat- ing toil was so readily procured, and where a just forethought did for a servant what was here neg- lected for the mistress of the family. And then his thoughts reverted to an humbler home; he saw the rgses clustering around the little porch before Mrs. Lee's door; the green sward, flecked with waving shadows; the twitter of birds about the eaves fell pleasantly on his dreaming ear; and the glass of sparkling water, from the well 8     I 4  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. beside the door, offered by kindly hands to parched lips, seemed to cool his own. Yet Mr. Lee was certainly a much poorer man than his new acquaintance; it was the natural dispositions of the two which made the difference. But he was roused to a sense of the present by Mr. Ellis, leading him up the steps, and knocking at the door. A woman, dressed in a faded calico, her sleeves rolled up above her elbows, answered the summons. "Come back, as you see, wife," said Mr. Ellis; "and I have brought this young fellow along to supply Fred's place." The woman looked rather doubtfully at Frank. "Oh, he will work better than you think," her husband hastened to add. "And now let us have some water, to wash a little of the dust off; it must be near supper-time." "Yes, it is only half an hour till five o'clock," she answered, and led the way to the back porch, where some basins were ranged on a bench, and two large towels hung above them. Frank and Mr. Ellis had scarcely finished their ablutions, when the rest of the men belonging to the farm entered the yard, and hastened to follow their example. A short time after, they were seated around a large table in the kitchen, fur- nished with coarse but abundant viands, which speedily disappeared before the hungry workers.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I5 No one paid much attention to Frank, beyond a curious glance directed toward him now and then; and, too weary and agitated to have much appe- tite, he was glad when the meal was over, and Mrs. Ellis proposed to show him his sleeping quarters. Left alone in the little garret room assigned to him, he sat down by the small window, in the only chair afforded him; a bed, and a box, in which were his clothes, completed the furni- ture. The rich light of sunset bathed the landscape in a golden glow, and brought to view all its beauties; and Frank's enthusiasm all returned as he gazed with delight upon the scene before him. In imagination, he already saw himself the owner of such a farm, embellished with all the appliances of taste which this so sadly lacked; his mother and sisters once more happy in a home of their own. And with that thought he fell to musing of what they were doing now; the little group gathered round the tea-table; his mother's eyes dimmed by loving tears, as they sought for him in vain; the sweet prattle of Kate and Nora-ah, how different from the scene he had just passed through! But as the light waned, his mind returned from its wandering to his own immediate prospects. He saw clearly that hard toil and little sympathy     "6  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. lay before him here; that Mr. Ellis, though hon- est, and, perhaps, kindly, was too narrow in his ideas to set value on any qualification but capac- ity for work, and that he would not be apt to make much allowance for want of practice. But his spirits rose undaunted in the face of these difficulties. Was he not beginning the life he had wished for (a little lower down in the scile, perhaps, than he would have exactly chosen- but, in this country, one must rise), with better remuneration than he had dared to expect, though in itself not much? and it made little difference to him, if the people among whom his lot was cast were ignorant or selfish; he would stay here for awhile, at least, and the way might open to something better still. Meanwhile, he determined to lay by some of his wages for the future, not neglecting to send small sums to his mother, from time to time, for he would not re- linquish bearing his part of the family expenses. How proud he would be the first time he could send them such a token of prosperity, and how pleased they would feel in receiving it! Yes, he would write to his mother and Rose to-morrow, and tell them of his good fortune. Had not his wisdom proved the best, after all? How stupid it was to think of remaining in Green Hollow, when "the world was all before him, where to choose!"So the night fell upon his musing,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    II7 and, full of eager longing for the morrow, he sought his rest. Days and weeks passed, and Frank had be- come somewhat inured to his new position. His companions treated him with respect, at least, for he made no contemptible figure at their own work, and they had caught a glimpse of accomplishments foreign to them; had lis- tened to his reading, and seen samples of his fine handwriting; and were candid enough, most of them, to acknowledge his superiority. Mr. Ellis. was not the last to discover these things; and he generally found it convenient now to call on Frank's aid to regulate his ac- counts-out of working hours, be it observed. Did he not live in his own house, and had he not, therefore, a right to exact his whole time? For not a cent did Frank receive in consequence, beyond what he already had; so that the poor boy's acquirements were actually a loss, instead of any gain to him, in this instance; yet his em- ployer never took a thought of how meanly, nay, how unjustly, he was acting. But why should we marvel at such conduct in an uneducated, covetous man, then? Such dishonesty has not died out yet, even among those who do not want for clearer light upon the subject. As time passed on, however, a careful observer could not have failed to notice that, though     II8  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Frank strove to resist the influence, the unusual toil and new climate, the different surroundings of his daily life from all he had been accustomed to, were each producing their inevitable effect. His step was less light, his voice less ringing; there were dark circles under his eyes, that spoke of restless, feverish nights; and the eyes them- selves were fast losing all trace of their. olden sparkle, and becoming dull and listless; a strange languor seemed to pervade his whole frame, and he forced himself, with difficulty, to perform his allotted tasks. All these were tokens whose meaning an in- terested eye would have been quick to discern; but there was none such to regard him. To Mrs. Ellis, he was one of the many for whom she prepared daily food, and took no further trouble. What was his history to her, that she should heed him more than the rest? And where a woman's eyes are blind to such a case, what hope is there that others should see more clearly? Ah, how his mother's heart would have been wrung, could she have seen him now, becoming fast the mere shadow of his former self! But she guessed nothing of the truth, for his letters home were still written in a cheerful strain, though at longer intervals. He was fain to conceal, even from himself, his failing strength,   ROSE CARLETON'OS REWARD.   119 "I'll tell you what it is, Carleton," said Jack Rivers, the most friendly of his companions, one day, when they were resting a little from their work, "you are just wearing yourself to death here; any one can see it in your face. If you do not take a turn for the better, you will soon be unfit for any thing."  "But what would you have me do?" asked Frank, wearily. "Leave this place, at any rate," replied the other. "If I knew half that you do, you wouldn't find me here long! It is shameful the way old Ellis treats you-gets you to do so many things we can not-and does n't give you a cent more! I would n't stand it any longer. Why, in the city you could get as much-and more-for writing, and keeping accounts, as he gives you altogether!" "I never was suited for a life like that," Frank answered;"I know that I should not succeed if I tried; I have done so already, and I could not feel content in it, I was brought up to a country life." "It must have been an easier one than this, then," returned his companion, "or you would not show the marks of the difference so soon; but, mind my words, if you do not alter your life now, you will be sorry for it! I do n't want to discourage or make little of you, Frank; you     120  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. know I am your friend-you have often done me a good turn; and it is no proof that you would not do very well on a farm of your own, because you are not able to bear such constant hard work as the rest of us." "Ah! but how am I ever to possess that farm -that is the question?" "Not by delving here, that's sure," said Jack. "Do what I say-go back home, fill you get quite strong again; and then try your fortune in the nearest city; and, with carefulness, you might be able, in seven or eight years, to pur- chase a small farm and return to the pursuit you like; there is no reason to feel as if you had given it up for good, because you do so for a time. That's my advice-and I wish you would take it." "I will think of it," replied Frank, thanking him; "but why do you not follow it yourself? Why are you so content to remain here?" "Oh, that is quite a different thing," he an- swered. "I am used to the life and the climate -which you are not; then I am far stronger; besides, what else could I do? I have not your education; I have a little, to be sure, but not enough to enable me to alter my condition, if I wished to, which I do n't; and-I do n't want to hurt you-but still remember that my father is living, and settled on a comfortable place of his   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    121 own; and the only reason I am here is, that he has plenty of sons able to help him, without me; so I may as well be earning a little ready money, if I like; but for you, who have, as you say, a mother and sisters dependent, in a good degree, upon your exertion, it is madness to en- gage in any thing that threatens your health- to take care of that is your first duty." "There goes the dinner horn," interrupted Frank, glad, perhaps, that the ponversation was ended for the time; for it mdy have reminded him, more strongly than he felt in the mood for then, of Rose's arguments before he left home. The idea of returning there, suggested by Jack, was utterly-repugnant to him; that would be to acknowledge himself defeated-and after so short a trial? No; he would conquer this illness that was stealing over him so subtly; he would follow his friend's advice, save in that one point (ah! Frank, remember, that was the start- ing one!), and begin another life. Was, his mother's prediction meeting a fulfillment al- ready? That very night his resolution was taken; as soon as he could escape to his little room after the supper he had scarcely tasted, he sat down, and began to indite a letter to his mother-tell- ing her that he was going to leave his situation there next week, and try for something in the     I22  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. city; he was dissatisfied, both with the work and the pay; and one of his comrades had ad- vised him to this step, which he had at last de- termined to take. He felt a little unwell, he added, but the change would soon set him up again; and concluded by promising to write as soon as he was settled at his new work. He would have gone on to give his reasons more at length, and to tell how he had been treated, but a curious feeling of drowsiness crept over him- a great longing for repose seemed to possess his whole being-and, laying down his pen, he has- tened to prepare for rest. He was dimly con- scious of his thoughts wandering off in impos- sible illusions, even while repeating his prayers -of seeing objects in the room that he knew were miles away; and once or twice through the night he was awakened by the sound of his own voice talking loudly and incoherently; then he fell into a heavy, senseless slumber, that lasted till an hour after day-break. The pure, fresh morning air, streaming through the little window, which he had left wide open, revived him; and when he had gone down to the well and cooled his face by repeated bathings, he returned to fold and direct his letter. There is something in merely having decided on a new course of action which inspires hope; and Frank felt lighter hearted than he had done for many a   ROSE CARLETON'S RE}WARD.    r23 day, as he placed the missive in his pocket'and descended the stairs. The other members of the family were just rising from the breakfast table as he entered the room; and Jack Rivers, noticing him, came instantly to his' side. He was a kind-hearted fellow--rather superior to the rest of his class- this farmer's son, and had been attracted to Frank from the first day he spoke to him, for he was the first well-educated person he had met who treated him as a companion. Though ig- norant in many) things, he yet knew enough to respect knowledge in another, and to thirst for more himself; his father had been more indul- gent in the matter of books and schooling than most men of his means, and, as Jack had always shown a turn for reading, he failed not to take advantage of the few opportunities presented him for extending his acquaintance with the works of such authors as he could reach. This had greatly contributed to purify his language from the slang phrases too frequent with his compan- ions; and except for a slip now and then, when habit got the better of education-for he strove to improve himself in this direction-his speech was tolerably free from grammatical errors. It was this contrast to. the rest of those by whom he was surrounded, that had first arrested Frank's attention; nor was the other slow to perceive     124  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. the advantage that must accrue to him from this contact with a really cultivated mind, and sought, by many a little kindly deed and word, to improve the acquaintance. The benefit, moreover, was mutual; Frank was, perhaps, too prone to lean on old' customs and follow old trains of thought; while there was a freshness and originality in Jack's ideas that gave a healthy agitation to the current, and kept it from stagnation. The ge- nius of the two governments under which they had lived may have had a share in producing this difference; for the laws controlling a coun- try must, more or less, modify and form the character of even its most obscure citizen; and the old, settled, conservative state of things, un- der which Frank had grown up, while he might not agree with it in theory, must, nevertheless, have influenced, in no small degree, though un- consciously, his habits of thought and action. Jack, on the other hand, accustomed to regard himself as an integral part of his government, and to scrutinize those in authority-unawed by the insignia of power surrounding them-and reverencing principles rather than men, reached conclusions with a promptitude and freedom that might sometimes degenerate into rashness; and that astonished his more cautious companion. Meanwhile, he and Frank have been holding an earnest conversation.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    125 "I am glad to see you, at last," were Jack's first words; "I was afraid you were really sick' when you didn't come to breakfast; but you look a little better. Now, if you would only not  work to-day, this illness might blow over-all you need is rest," "To-morrow is Sunday, you know," Frank answered; "I can rest then; and listen, Jack- I believe I have about made up my mind to: do as you said, yesterday; and I would not like to miss getting my full pay this week, especially, by not working for once." "You are foolish," said Jack; "it is going to be dreadfully hot, and you can not tell what harm working under such a sun may do you- even I shrink from it! Think how fresh you would be for starting on your new quest if you rested to-day and to-morrow." "Oh, nonsense, Jack!" returned the other, laughingp. "I am not such an invalid as you seem to think, so do n't go on croaking. I will follow you as soon as I have given this letter to the boy Mr. Ellis is sending into town." "Well, well," said his friend, reluctantly, as they separated, "I suppose you must have your way; but I wish you would listen to reason." The day did prove, as Jack had prophesied, "dreadfully hot," and long before the morning was over Frank's face and manner both showed,     I26  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. unmistakably, the evil his obstinacy had wrought. When the dinner-horn sounded, he told Jack he did not care for any, and would not tire himself by the hot walk to the house, but lie down under a tree instead, and rest till their return. He felt miserably ill, and looked with despair toward the long, sultry afternoon; but it was some re- lief to be left alone for awhile. When the others came back, he took his place among them again, though his head felt dizzy v and sick-perhaps he feared Jack's "I told you so!" if he permitted himself to show too pal- pable signs of fatigue-and tried to work as cheerfully and well as any. But there comes a time when the strongest will must succumb to bodily necessity; and, after the lapse of two or three hours, it came to Frank; it was nearly four o'clock, and the sun's rays fell upon the scorched earth with unabated force; the tired laborers had stopped for a few minutes to wipe their heated brows, and exchange remarks on that never-failing topic, the weather, when Jack, turning to address Frank, who stood near, saw him, in that instant, become so deathly pale as nearly to drive the color from his own cheeks, with sympathetic fear. He was by his side im- mediately, entreating him, even yet, to desist from this vain effort; for a moment Frank faced him, his lips quivering in the fruitless at-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I27 tempt to form a reply; then suddenly he fell upon the grass at his friend's feet, in a dead faint. There was an instant commotion throughout the field; while some of the men ran to bring water from the stream near by, Jack stooped down to loosen his clothing and chafe the cold hands; the cool water dashed on his forehead  revived him a little, but almost immediately he became insensible again; it was evident that great exhaustion was the cause. "We must make some sort of a litter, and carry him to the house," aid Jack, addressing the others. The branches of a tree that had been cut down a week before lay on the ground beside the stream, and they hastened to construct a Tude conveyance from them. While waiting for this to be ready, Jack continued his efforts to restore his unfortunate friend to consciousness, but without much success. "Here's what'll bring him to quicker than all your. work!" said a voice beside him; he turned and saw one of the laborers holding a flask of spirits in his hand. Jack had all the prejudices of one accustomed to strict temperance, both from principle and habit, against the use of such a commodity; but now, in his extremity, he reached forth his hand     128  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. eagerly to take it, and cautiously poured a little of the contents between the tightly-locked teeth. "Ha, ha!" laughed the donor, as he watched its effect, "I told you so; now, I hope you won't preach to me-after this!" The men coming up with the litter at that moment, prevented Jack from replying. Frank had opened his eyes and recognized his friend, but was still weak and helpless as an infant. A covering was thrown over his face, and they took up their march to the house, most of the men following, some from a kindly interest in the sufferer, and others glad of any excuse to intermit their toil and relieve the monotony of the day. Two had gone before to acquaint their employers with the accident, and there was much curious speculation among the remainder as to how Mrs. Ellis, in particular, would act. It was a well-known rule on the farm that no hand was allowed to stay there sick; and to those who had homes near, and friends informed of their condition, it did not make much differ- ence; but here was a case where, if strictly ad- hered to, it would become a cruelty. A boy, whose father, as most of them knew, was dead, and whose home lay miles away from the scene of his labors, though none knew exactly where, and who, if not sheltered and taken care of till   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    129 his friends could arrive, must certainly die- surely none would be so heartless as to turn such a one from their door. The character of Mrs. Ellis may readily be inferred from the need of discussing such a 'question at all. She. was an avaricious, covet- ous woman, whose whole life's ambition was to grasp as great an amount of property as pos- sible, without much regard as to how it was obtained. Not that she would have stolen, or spoken falsely, or defrauded her neighbor aught in buying or selling.-but, alas! where were the generous feelings, the sympathy, the trust, the love, that should throb in every heart? No baby fingers had ever unlocked the sealed fount- ains of affection, or given her higher aims and aspirations than the mere accumulation of earthly dross; else how could she have turned with unpitying eyes from the sight of that young face, where Death already seemed to have set his mark and claimed him for his own? Oh, woman! woman! immersed in sordid cares, fostering in thy husband's breast, by thy evil example, the same fatal, devouring passion, do no words of solemn warning ring in thy ears: "What shall it profit thee if thou gain the whole world and lose thy own soul?" Meanwhile, Frank had been carried into the 9     130  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. yard and laid in the shadow of the house, and immediately after Mr. 'Ellis and his wife ap- peared in the doorway. Jack went forward to explain the difficulty. Mrs. Ellis heard him impatiently, casting from time to time a reproachful glance on her hus- band. "Did n't I tell you, over and over again," she said, in a vexed voice, turning first to him, "that the boy was getting sick, and to send him away; but you would n't? I hope you believe me now!" Then, speaking to Jack in a loud, determined tone, so that all could hear her, she went on: "Of course, he must not be brought into the house! we have never allowed it; and am! going to undertake the care of a sick person with only one girl to help me? And who is to pay the doctor's bill, I should like to know?" "I don't think he would need a doctor; quietness and care would be enough," replied Jack, striving to restrain his indignation. "Yes-not need a doctor, indeed!" she re- turned, "so that I might be blamed for his death, after all! No, no; take him away. There are some of your charitable folks in the town yonder; see what they will do! I am not going to fill my house with every foreign vaga- bond that comes along!'   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    131 So saying, she closed the door in his face. Mr. Ellis had so evidently concurred in her conduct that it was vain to hope for help from him; and Jack returned discomfited to his com- panions, who stared at each other in blank amazement. "Might have known it would turn out so!" he said, after venting his anger in terms not the most elegant or polite; "as well ask a wolf to be kind as her!" But it was not his habit to be long in finding resources, and he broke the momentary silence by exclaiming: "I tell you what I'll do, boys; get the old scoundrel's horse and wagon out, while they are busy talking in there, and I'll just take him home. It's three miles from here through the woods, and the road is shady; so the sun won't hurt him. Mother's never refused to do a good thing yet, and I know she won't this time. But this is my last day's work here, as sure as my name is Jack Rivers!" In a few moments the wagon was ready and Frank lifted into it. Not Rose herself could have laid him down more tenderly than did those rough hands, or spread the rude covering above him with more care. A second draught had been administered from the flask, and in a few minutes he sank into a feverish sleep; his hands     I32   ROSE CARLETOY'S REWARD. had become burning hot, and the scarlet flush deepening on his cheek heightened Jack's anx- iety; so, bidding his companions a hearty good- by, he started on his journey. "tFCAPERIX   CHAPTER IX. Blessing she is; God made her so; And deeds of week-day holiness Fall from her noiseless as the snow; Nor hath she ever chanced to know That aught were easier than to bless. y. R. Lowell. COOL     evening breeze had just sprung up after the extreme heat -of the day, and the doors and win- dows of a farm-house, situated a little back from the road Jack had taken, were thrown open, to allow its inmates a, share of the refresh- ing influence, when the clatter of a horse's hoofs and the rumbling of wheels, sounding faintly through the distance, drew the mistress of the dwelling to the door. It was an unusual hour for any visitor to arrive there; and she gazed curiously down the dusty avenue, shading her eyes with her hand, that she might better distinguish the coming guest; such, she knew, (I33) *     J34  ROSE CARLETON'S .REWARD. the person, whoever he might prove, must be, for the road led nowhere else. The wagon in which the traveler was seated drew nearer and nearer, until she could almost with certainty discern who he was; and, looking at him still more attentively, she exclaimed: "Why, it can be no other than Jack-but what in the world brings him home to-night!" And, so saying, she ran, as swiftly as she could, down the pathway to the gate. "Is that you, mother?" rang out a heartsome voice, a little tinged with anxiety, as she gained it; and, stopping his vehicle, Jack sprang hastily down from his elevated seat, and was by her side in an instant. "But is any thing the matter, Jack?" was her first question; "are you ill? though I'm sure you do n't look so," she added, gazing with eyes of motherly affection and pride on his eager, generous countenance. "Oh, no, mother," he answered, in an excited tone, leading her to the side of the wagon; "I am quite well-but you can't think what a shameful thing has happened! I 'll never go back there any more-never!" pointing signifi- cantly over his shoulder. Then, in a few hurried words, he gave her a sort of outline of the events recorded in the previous chapter. Her face, too, glowed with   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    135 indignation before he had concluded-though he had left the recital of details for a less urgent moment than the present; and when he with- drew the covering, and revealed Frank, just waking out of that feverish slumber, she bent over him, with all the tender sympathy of a good woman beaming from her eyes. "Poor lad!" she sighed; "poor lad! so young, too. What a pity of his mother!" and laid her hand upon his brow; it was a hard, rough hand, seamed with work, but oh, there was the blessing of Heaven's charity in its touch! "Is he very ill, then, mother.?" asked Jack, noticing the increasing seriousness of her face. "I fear so," she answered. "We must not delay any longer; drive up to the house at once; I will go before to prepare a bed, and tell your father-he must help you to carry him in." So saying, she walked up the path, while Jack threw open the large gate, and prepared to follow. Mrs. Rivers met her husband in the doorway as she entered the house. "I was just looking for you, Ruth; where were you? I wanted to ask--" but something in the expression of her eyes, and the disturbed flutter of her manner, arrested his further speech'; and he. broke off abruptly with- "Has any thing happened?"     136  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "Yes," she said, drawing nearer; "Jack has come home." "All the better," he answered, smiling, for he supposed she might think he would be dis- pleased. "You were longing for him last night -what else?" "He has brought some one with him." "Who?" "You remember his being so delighted with a lad staying with Mr. Ellis these few months past, who was poor, but knew a good deal- do n't you?" "Yes; go on." "Well, this poor young fellow, it seems, had but lately come to this country, and, though he had worked on his father's farm, had never be- fore attempted the life of a day-laborer; but he has been so very foolish as to try this here- and Jack says he really wrought wonderfully- you can guess the rest." "Got sick, of course?" "Yes; it was creeping on him for some time past, and to-day he fainted quite away while in the field. Mr. and Mrs. Ellis refused totally to admit him to their house; and, as his friends live many miles away, no one knew what to do. Jack was very angry, and at once got a wagon, and started to bring him to us-dear boy! he had such faith in our goodness!"   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    137 "He has him here now, then?" said her hus- band, in a slightly troubled tone. "Yes; he will be at the door in, a minute; you have no objection, Edward, surely, to re- ceiving this poor child under our roof?" "No, no, my dear; none at all; only I am afraid it will tax your strength too much these August days-we must take care of that before every thing;" and his eyes, full of tender con- cern, met hers. "Oh, I will be careful," she answered, grati- fied by his affectionate solicitude; "and Ellen can help me-so will Jack, for I suppose he will stay at home for awhile, now; besides, how could we have the heart to do otherwise!" "I am very sure you could n't, at least," re- plied her husband, laughing. "Ah! I see Jack coming up the hill, now." "Then I must hurry away, and be ready for him," said Mrs. Rivers. "Carry the boy right up to the east chamber-I will be there to meet you;" and, calling "Ellen," she ascended the stairs. Up that stairway a short time after strong arms carried Frank, and laid him between the snowy coverings of the bed. And then began the long vigil of anxiety and care. In that pleasant "east chamber"Frank lay unconscious for many weary days-raving wildly of home,     138  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. and mother, and Rose-of dreaded future mis- ery, and present despair. It was no light task Mrs. Rivers had undertaken; but, having once assumed it, she did not shrink from the burden or its consequences. Unable to afford the ex- pense of a physician, she went forward reso- lutely in the practice of her own simple reme- dies-with a courage that defied the possible censures of the world, when conscious of being in the path of duty. She had not, besides, much faith in the skill of the disciples of the healing art who were within her reach, and chose, rather, vto. expend whatever small sums she could spare in procuring a few little delica- cies for his convalescence. I need not say that Jack relieved her of much of the tedium of attendance on the sufferer, nor how deep was their generous joy when the dis- ease began slowly to yield to their efforts, and recovery was almost certain. Frank's heart swelled with love and gratitude to all-but most to her whose sweet, womanly help and comfort reminded him so strongly of his dear ones. As soon as he was able to sit up, he, had written a letter to his mother; and if Mis. Rivers could but have perused it, I think she would have felt repaid for all her trouble, by that unrestrained outpouring of a heart all alive to the appreciation of the least kind act.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    139 As he grew stronger each succeeding day, he sought in vain for some ostensible proof of the reality of his feelings, and longed to render some service, however slight, to his benefactors. Jack and he had become closer friends than ever; and laid many plans together for the fu- ture. Frank had determined to take his de- parture for the city, as soon as possible; but Mrs. Rivers declared that she would not allow him to leave her till the first of October. ( If I could only do something for you, then, in the meantime," he said, in a tone half laugh- ing, half despairing; "can't you think of any thing-only to keep me content?" But while she was cogitating the question, he suddenly broke forth with- "Oh, I know now! Do, dear Mrs. Rivers, let me teach your two youngest boys what little I can of writing and arithmetic, as long as I stay here." "Surely, if it pleases you," she replied, true refinement leading her not to slight the offer; "I am sure I will be very glad, and so will their fiher." So, for the last two weeks of Frank's stay, the little boys received daily instruction in the branches named, and Frank's health improved all the more rapidly from the elasticity em- ployment gave to his spirits.     "O  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. At last, his term of probation was over, and he was ready to bid adieu to his kind enter- tainers. Jack had long since procured his' clothes and other little valuables from Mr. Ellis's -not without some disdainfulwords passing be- tween them; and, on a bright October morning, when autumn was just beginning to hang out her gold and crimson banners, a light wagon drew up to the door, in which Jack was to con- vey his friend to the town that lay ten miles off, and in which he himself had a little business to transact; the rest of the journey would be per- formed by stage and railroad. The whole household was assembled on the porch to witness their young guest's departure; and their sincere words of farewell encourage- ment touched and cheered Frank's heart. "And now, my boy,"? said Mr. Rivers, grasp- ing his hand, "don't attempt any thing that your strength is not equal to; but when you once get a footing, stick to it--a rolling stone gathers no moss." And Mrs. Rivers' motherly arms enfolded him for the last time.        i "Write to your mother always, my dear," was her gentle advice; "I am sure you will do noth- ing of which she could be ashamed; and, if you have time, you may know that we will be glad of a line, too."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    141 Then the two boys mounted the wagon, and drove off through the cheerful morning sunlight, and cool autumn air, youth's song of hope echo- ing in their hearts. Mrs. Rivers had tried to induce Frank to re- turn home for a time before pushing his re- searches further; not that she would part with him any sooner on that account, she said, for she wished his mother, aboe- all, to see him quite strong and well. But when Frank found it would not expedite his departure, he argued that it would be but a waste of time; and, shaking his slender purse before her eyes, asked, smilingly, if that was not a-.sufficient reason for avoiding unnecessary expense. So she yielded the point, not without reluctance. Frank was fully awake now to the mistake he had committed in attempting to follow a life for which he was so unsuited; but while he acknowl- edged his lack of judgment in being so impatient to resume a country life, when the circumstances were so entirely adverse, he was still unwilling to admit the wisdom of returning home; his vision coJd discern nothing higher there than his. old station in Mr. Breton's store, and he was deter- mined to achieve some position more exalted than that. The two friends separated early in the after- noon, with much regret on both sides. l      "2  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "And you will be sure to let us know how you get on?" said Jack. "Oh, I am sure you will do grandly! I declare, Frank, I half envy you going out to seek your fortune!" "I wish the search was ended," answered Frank, laughing. "If it will only. close in such a pleasant home as yours, my highest hopes would be gratified." "Oh, never fear," said Jack, "you may accom- plish more than that. And now, good-by; I wish we were going together." Good-by, dear Jack! Tell your mother how dearly I shall always remember her; and I hope she will sometimes think of me." Then Frank went his way, and his friend turned slowly homeward. Little did either fore- see the. time that should elapse before their next meeting. Frank did not reach his destination till the following morning; and his first care was to find a cheap and quiet lodging. This occupied the entire forenoon, and he esteemed himself fortunate in succeeding so soon. Tired and hungry, he sat down to his simple refreshment of crackers and water, with one of the ripe, luscious apples Mrs. Rivers had slipped into his bag, by way of dessert; and, truly, there is no luxury so seldom met with, or so enjoyable, as a really good apple. He' took his light repast   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    143 with all the zest of a healthy appetite just freed from the restraint of illness; and, at its close, sallied forth to see what could be found in the way of employment. And here, at the very outset, he fell into an error that could scarcely fail to affect his future. The very clearness with which he saw the truth of his mother's prediction concerning the voca- tion he had just abandoned, the acute sense he had of having, indeed, completely lost the sum- mer, filled him with a burning desire to retrieve the time, if possible; to attain success that should banish all thought or remembrance of the delay, save as a slight obstacle which energy easily overcame. But, while it was well to feel the need of action, it was equally baneful to any real achievement in life, no matter what, to allow a sense of time's swift flight to oppress the mind unduly, a feeling that must lead to rashness, either in accepting or declining what fortune offered. Oh, if he could but have called to his aid a share of Rose's lowly, heaven-born wisdom! if he could but have acknowledged that the mis- take had been committed; that no haste now could cancel it, or avert the consequences-might but make them worse; that what remained was to take up his life again from that point, as from a new beginning, nor perpetuate the fault of the     I44  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. past by letting it influence his future. Not that he was ungrateful; he felt deeply thankful for his restoration to life and health, and for the kind friends who had sheltered him in his need. The very defects of his character sprang from a basis of pure home-love; it was a too eager anticipa- tion of the future that marred his efforts; as Rose had said, he did not possess that patience which can work slowly but steadily toward a de- sired end, and await the reward, instead of blindly seeking it. The streets were thronged with the busy pop- ulation- of a manufacturing town, and none guessed or cared that a new life had joined the current, as Frank mingled with the crowd of weary toilers or eager pleasure-seekers that poured down the principal thoroughfare. An utter stranger, there was but one course open to him-to inquire at any place he passed where it might seem likely his services would be accepted. He had no one's judgment to rely on, save his own, but he set out with a hopeful heart, deter- mined not to be easily discouraged in his search. The first place he entered was .a large retail dry goods store. "Ah," said Frank, mentally, as he walked up the aisle and inquired for the owner, "this is something like! how different from that dragging little store in Green Hol- low!"   ROSE CARLETON'S BREWARD.   145 But the color of his meditations altered some- what, as the master of the establishment came forward, in answer to the summons. He had a pen thrust hastily behind one ear, and his face looked careworn, anxious, and sour, as if the in- terruption annoyed him. How pleasanly had Mr. Breton's greeting sounded, as they met in the morning-how cheerful his "good-night"! What a true, gentlemanly courtesy had marked his manner alike to all! "No chance here, that's plain," was the young aspirant's comment, as he glanced at the forbid- ding countenance before him; nevertheless, he confronted him with a good courage, and did not allow his face to betray his feelings. "And what may your business be with met young man?" the store-keeper said, after glanc- ing cursorily at Frank's whole appearance, the keen eye of trade detecting at once that it was not a customer who claimed his attention. "Come, make haste!" he added, as Frank hes- itated how to begin. "This morning is a tolerably busy one with us; I have no time to spare." "I merely wished to ask if you had any situa- tion open at present," Frank hastened to say, a little abashed by his manner. "Yes, I suppose I have; if I could find a clerk to suit. Have you had any experience in the business?" I0     "6  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "A little," Frank answered; "but I would try my best to please." The merchant ruminated for a moment. "Fresh from some paltry country store, that's evident," he thought. "Still, he looks like a -gentleman, and might be worth taking." Then added aloud, "What salary would you expect? I can not afford to give a high one." "I would not look for such at first, of course," said Frank. The merchant named a sumr much below the general terms; even to Frank it appeared ex- ceedingly small; he could not help a start of dis- appointment. "You are not satisfied with that?" said the other. "H-it is rather expensive living here," stammered Frank. "I am separated from my family, and that makes it still worse." "Oh, well," said the store-keeper, turning' carelessly away, "suit yourself. I can find plenty others glad of the place." And, seeming to consider the conference at an end, he walked back to his desk. "I must try somewhere else," thought Frank, as he gained the street. "There would be no use in taking such an offer. The price of my boarding and lodging, to say nothing of clothes, would leave me but little to save. Better to   ROSE CARLETOW'S REWARD.    147 have stayed in Green Hollow, ten times, than begin a life like that!" But he soon found that this experience was but the type of many. Some had too many hands already; some, alleging their business was dull, offered even lower terms than those he had rejected. The fact of his being a stranger made him a fit subject for imposition with most. Sometimes he was refused. a hearing at all. Faint and discouraged, it was late in the evening when --he found himself in the lower and less respectable part of the city. The streets here were still thronged with artisans and miners returning from their work, and wo- men and children crowded the grocery stores, making purchases. Following the stream, Frank' entered the largest of these, and blent with the throng around the counter. He saw, with a thrill of hope, that the number of assistants- only two-was wholly inadequate to the demand upon their services, and waited patiently until the owner could spare time to speak with him. He was a rough man, but his manner was some- what kinder than the dry goods merchant's had been, and his terms a trifle honester: still, so much below Frank's early hopes, that, had he not been thoroughly wearied in the search, he would have hesitated long before accepting the situation; even as it was, he did so a little.     "8  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "You can take to-night to think it over, if you like," said the store-keeper, noticing his in- decision, "and come back in the morning to let me know. We are very busy now, and if you agree to the terms, I would like you to come ready to spend the day in the store; in fact, I should have engaged help long before this, but I could not spare time to look around." "I thank you," answered Frank; "I suppose it is the best I can do; at any rate, I will call early in the morning, and give you my deci- sion." As he walked back to his lodging, Frank felt but half content, there was nothing bright or pleasant in the surroundings of his new situa- tion. "But it is well to have made a beginning, at least," was the reflection in which he sought comfort, as he ascended the stairs to his little room. "When I get to know and be known, I may hope for something better." The apartment looked terribly lonesome and dreary as he entered it; but he would not allow his mind to dwell on the contrast it offered to home; and, striking a light, sat down by the small table, and, drawing a letter from his pocket, opened it and began to read. He had told his mother, in the letter written during his convalescence, to direct her reply to the city-partly, to antici- pate any intention she might form of coming to   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    149 see him at 'Mr. RiverS', and partly because he would 'be more certain to receive it; accord- ingly, he had called at the post-office during the day, and found a letter awaiting him, in Rose's handwriting. The cloud vanished from his brow-the wea- riness and despondence from his heart, as his eye followed those graceful characters. Oh, sweet home-love! thou art the balm of life, high or, lowly.! the perfume, without which the flower of existence were but a worthless weed! Again hope nerved the young toiler's heart. "It shall not all be vain!" he mur- mured, half audibly, pressing his lips to the beloved names; "I will yet return to them, blessed with success!" The aspect of the room no longer oppressed him; his spirits were light and cheerful as he turned to appease his hunger by viands of nearly as modest an order as his morning re- past; for, as he had determined to save all he could, he meant to provide his own meals, ex- cept on rare occasions. He had scarcely be- gun, however, when a light tap sounded on the door, and his landlady entered, carrying a cup of tea, whose very fragrance was refreshing to  his weary frame. She looked on her young lodger with eyes of kindly interest; her own son was far away on the wide ocean, and her     150  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. mother's heart yearned toward one whose lone- liness served as a reminder of him, she held so dear. "I saw you coming in," she hastened to say, as Frank started up at the interruption; "you looked so tired, I thought a warm cup of tea might do you good. Please take it," she added, as if fearful of a refusal. Frank thanked her heartily; but knowing he must feel embarrassed by her presence, she soon withdrew. "He looks as if he had been ill lately," she mused, as she retraced her steps. "I am glad I went up. Sure, I would like people to be kind to my poor Robin!"This last as an excuse for her extravagance. As for Frank-thanks to the letter, and that simple, generous act-there was much more of thanksgiving than of petition in his prayers that night; and, while he gazed on life with soberer eyes than heretofore, he also prepared to meet it with a truer courage; he had made one step, at least for the present, toward that humility which, while it preserves its possessor from be- ing unduly exalted by partial success, preserves him, also, from being unduly depressed by fail- ure. Something like this was the temper of his mind as he determined to accept the offer last   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    151 made to him-resolved to become content with a lot of slow, but steady progress. His after career alone can show whether old impulses or new were most powerful in fixing his destiny. in     CHAPTER X. Touch us gently, Time! We've not proud nor souring wings.

HE days passed on at Green Hollow in their usual, calm  routine, after Frank's departure; save that, in one small household a great blank was  left, as if half the sunlight had fol- lowed in his train.  Kate and Nora, however, soon recovered their cheer- fulness with the natural buoyancy of childhood; and constant occupation, joined to, the desire she felt of supporting and cheering her mother under this new trial, gave healthy employment to Rose's mind, and kept her from brooding too much over the separation she so (152)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     153 deeply regretted. Frank's first letter, written, as it was, in the exultation of his first success, dispersed the lingering gloom-made them feel, by tangible proof, that they were yet inrcommu- nication with the wanderer, and that the distance which parted them was not so formidable as their ardent imaginations had at first supposed it. Oh, what a precious boon that letter was! how lit- tle Frank, with all his affectionate picturings of home, conceived the delight it carried to the hearts that loved him-from the first half fear- ful reading to the quiet pleisure and assurance of the oft-repeated perusal, when even little Nora would listen with ever-fresh interest to the news from "Brother Frank." Mrs. Carleton's early fears, however, were not quite dissipated; she dreaded to hear, with each succeeding mail, of illness, or, perhaps, worse, as the effect of the employment on which he had entered; but as week after week passed away, bringing cheerful tidings still, she at last began to think she had been over-cautious, and to lay aside her too-well-founded forebodings. Then came the announcement of Frank's in- tended departure from Mr. Ellis's, coupled with that slight hint of his illness; but that slight hint was sufficient to arouse all the latent anx- iety of mother and sister to new life. Mrs. Carleton would have flown eagerly to see him,     154  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. and insist on his return-for she justly feared that the half had not been told her-but many difficulties environed her, and effectually ar- rested her steps. First, it was very uncertain whether she would find Frank still at Mr. Ellis's on her arrival; and, if not, it seemed almost useless to attempt a journey to the city he had named as his next stopping-place; for a search there could not promise much success, in the lack of any definite information to guide her. And was it right to leave her family, and incur such expense, on the mere supposition- strong though it might be-of one child's ill- ness, with so slender a chance of discovering his abode? But just at this point a second ar- gument, and one that could not be gainsaid, in- terposed, and put a stop at once to all hesitation and debate. Nora, the darling, the flower of the flock, became suddenly and alarmingly ill, with some childish complaint, then prevalent in the village; and, for a time, anxiety for the ab- sent was eclipsed by the more urgent need of the one still with them. Poor Rose! her love for her little sister had been nearly akin to a mother's, and who can tell the sorrow that convulsed her heart, as she hovered around the sufferer's bed, seeking to render all the aid affec- tion could devise; praying with anguished ear- nestness that this great sorrow might be averted   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     155 -that her brother's return might not be shad- owed by such a cruel loss? And then, just when  all seemed darkest-when they almost forgot to notice, blinded by the misery so near them, that day after day was passing, and still no tidings from Frank-there came a gleam of hope; the cloud slowly lifted, and the oppressed hearts of the grieving watchers beat freely once again.. The child's recovery was rapid; and, after the first week of convalescence, Rose's school, which had been interrupted, not only on account of Nora's illness, but that of other children who attended it, was resumed. "Oh, if we had but a letter from Frank, how happy we would be!" was her half-uttered thought, as she entered the school-room that morning; and she reproached herself with in- gratitude to heaven for ever having repined at her lot, merely because he could not share it with her-more than thankful now, could she but hear of his well-being. Her pupils shared her joy in their little play- mate's recovery; and she was affected almost to tears by their artless questionings and delight. Never had the morning passed so quickly or so pleasantly, both to teacher and taught; and it was with feelings of renewed and affectionate interest in her vocation that Rose at last rang the little bell for dismission.     r56  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. As the last child disappeared through the doorway, and she turned to arrange her work before leaving the room, hurried steps were heard ascending the area path, and, opening the window, she saw Kate, who had been sent to the store on a message, flying toward the house-her hair streaming in the wind; carrying her bonnet in one hand, and-wonder of wonders! joy of joys!--a letter in the other! The poor child was all out of breath with eagerness and de- light, for she never doubted that the letter so long desired could be the harbinger of aught but good. Rose paled with hope and fear; and her trembling limbs almost refused to carry her to the door, which Kate burst open impetu- ously, crying- "Mamma! mamma! sister! sister! a letter- a letter! come here-quick!" but her mother not immediately answering to her call, she was has- tening forward, with unabated speed, to bring the news to her, when Rose arrested her progress. "Come in here, dear Kate," she said, in a low and agitated voice, throwing open the school- room door; "you will frighten Nora, and mam- ma, too, by calling to them so; show me the letter." Kate was calmed by her sister's manner and words, and stood by quietly while she examined the precious missive.   -ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.   157 "It is directed by himself," Rose said at last, when she could control herself to speak, "thank God! thank God!" and a flood of tears relieved her burdened heart. "And now we will go to mamma, Kate; she must open it," she added, wiping her eyes and embracing her sister, who gladly agreed; and the two entered Mrs. Carleton's room, where little Nora still kept state as an invalid. "Kate has forgotten your message, mamma," said Rose, "but she has brought you something else that will more than make up for it; what do we wish for most?" "O Rose, you can not mean it!" exclaimed her mother; "have you really got a letter from Frank? Oh, how could you keep it hidden a moment!" as her daughter laid it in her out- stretched hand. "I was afraid to tell you too suddenly, dear mamma," she answered, kneeling down by her mother's chair, and watching with eager eyes the breaking of the seal. "Look, it is addressed by himself; so he must be well!" she continued, for she saw the trembling of the fingers that essayed to unfold the closely-written sheet, and sought to re-assure her. "He is-he is!" cried Mrs. Carleton, as her glance ran rapidly over the page; and then, with quivering lips, read aloud, to the breathless little     158  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. group, Frank's account of his illness and recov- ery, and his glowing praises of Mrs. Rivers and Jack. "Heaven forever bless her!" cried the grate- 'ful, weeping widow, as she reached the close. "Oh, that I could but thank her for that most merciful kindness!"  And as they knelt in praise and thanks to the great All-Merciful, a new name was added to those whom, morning and night, they remem- bered before His throne. Oh, think not that such prayers are unavailing; richer recom- pense than aught bestowed by man shall they call down on those for whom they ascend! And how hope and energy sprang to life anew! And the autumn passed cheerily, for Frank continued to tell them of his movements from time to time, and they, in turn, failed not to requite him by the recital of theirs. Mr. Breton missed his young assistant much, and, soon after his departure, he offered Rose both pleasant and profitable employment in taking a share in the duties of the store, every afternoon. As she had no settled occupation for that por- tion of the day, she gladly accepted, with her mother's consent, the proposition; and, as she was not required to return to the store after tea, her strength was not taxed too severely; indeed, such was the added lightness success gave to   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    159 her spirits, that her health improved, instead of otherwise; and her blooming, gentle face, and kindly manner, attracted the farmers' wives and daughters who came to buy, far more than Mr. Breton's greatest courtesy had ever done. She was so delighted to bring to their notice aught that was new or pretty, so ready to sympathize with all their little womanly fancies, that though a rival establishment, boasting far more showy attractions, had put up its sign-board only three miles off, there was not a matron or maiden in all the district round who did not prefer to come to Green Hollow, that they might have the benefit of her advice on the color of a ribbon, the pattern of a gown, or the, prettiest mode of wearing a kerchief. "You would be both amused and delighted to see me in your place," Rose wrote to Frank. "You remember how you used to laugh at the idea of my becoming a saleswoman? and, in- 'deed, I never could have hoped to succeed so well." Mr. Breton was not insensible to the advan- tage he had gained in employing Rose, nor un- willing, as some ignoble natures would be, to acknowledge the influence she exercised on the prosperity of the business ; and Mrs. Breton did not fall behind in her praises. "I really think, my dear," she said, one even-     160  ROSE CARLETON'S REWIARD. ing, "that you ought to raise Miss Carleton's salary; we are getting on much better now than ever, and certainly she has had no little share in bringing it about ; I would so like our prosperity to be a cause of rejoicing to them as well as to us." "Well, Anne," replied her husband, cordially, "I believe you are right; her assistance is worth a great deal; and since her brother went away, her burdens must be far heavier; then, she is so ready and eager to work, it is a shame not to encourage her. How high do you think we ought to go?" "I had not fixed on the exact sum," Mrs. Bre- ton answered, "but do you think it would be too much to give her the same as you gave her brother? I know she only spends half the time in the store that he did, but her influence is such as he never could have exerted, and she is not idle a moment." "Well, I will think of it," said Mr. Breton, "at any rate, I will increase her salary some." And he did not only think of it, but, what was much more to the point, act on it-and how few there are who carry out a good intention to the full! how many would never have felt the impulse at all, congratulating themselves, in- stead, on having procured such valuable service at so low a price, and expecting, into the bar-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I6I gain, that the weary toiler should feel endless gratitude for the wonderful goodness of being employed at all! Now, gratitude is an excel- lent impulse, when properly directed, and Rose's whole heart did go out in adoring thankfulness to the Gracious Being who had led her steps to her present dwelling-place, but toward her employers she simply felt the delight experienced by one friend when another has helped them to an honorable and useful position. She knew that she gave honest work in requital of the remu- neration accorded, and did not, therefore, feel weighed ddwn by an oppressive sense of bene- fit; but when Mr. Breton offered her the same salary her brother had received, she was thrilled with delighted surprise at this unsolicited ad- vance. "Oh, sir," she said, tears dimming her eyes, "you are too generous!" "Not a bit of it!" he replied, in his heartiest tone; "do not confound two things, my dear girl, and give simple justice the name of gener- osity. Your aid is worth that, and more, to me, if I could afford to give you all your deserts." And he was right; she was worth it all. What a blessing from above must rest on that enterprise which awards to each of its helpers their righteous due. "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withhold- II     162   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. eth more than is meet, but it tendeth to pov- erty." So all things prospered with the little house- hold, for the mother, who oversaw and directed all, knew well how to exercise a true and just economy, very different from parsimony. The little garden furnished their table abundantly with healthy fruits and vegetables far on into the autumn; and Farmer Lee took care that it should not suffer, now that Frank was gone, for lack of hands to cultivate it, and he himself, or one of his laborers, spent more or less time there every week; and so apparent was the kindness that prompted the act, that neither Rose nor Mrs. Carleton dare hint at compen- sation, lest they should never be forgiven. for thinking of such a thing. Many a little pres- ent, too, of nice mutton, or beef, or lamb, gave a relish to their simple fare-gifts shyly offered, with some excuse, invented at the moment, of a superior quality, on which they wished them to decide; as in Tennyson's pretty romance, Philip gave to Annie, "With some pretext of fineness in the meal, To save the offense of charitable, flour From his tall mill'that whistled on the waste." And Mrs. Lee, with true mother-instinct, dis- covering when the children's birthday's befell,   ROSE CARLETON 'S REWARD.   163 usually contrived that a dainty chicken, or other little extra, should lend them the air of festivals for the whole family-sweet interchanges these! meet subjects for grateful feeling! Nor, though they wrought cheerily through the week, did they the less hail the welcome rest, or rather change of occupation, for body and mind, which the Lord's Day brought, and Mrs. Carleton acknowledged, with a deeper sense of its truth than ever before, that happiness lies not in out- ward circumstances, as she walked to church with her sweet daughter by her side, and Kate and Nora running on hand in hand before, ra- diant and happy, their rosy faces peeping charm- ingly from within their white sun-bonnets-their simple lawnfrocks, neatly and tastefully made, revealing the judicious hand that clothed them. Then, in the afternoon, while that lovely autumn weather lasted, it was the custom of the little party to adjourn to the woods, to breathe the fresh air, and lose the sense of confinement impressed by the narrow bounds of their poor abode. Mrs. Carleton usually brought a pocket- bible, and read aloud from the Old and'New Testament, as the children desired; Kate and Nora had each the privilege of selecting the part on alternate days; and it was curious to observe the different bent of mind the choice indicated-Kate generally taking some of the     I64  ROSE CARILETON'S REWARD. historical narratives of-the Old, while little Nora preferred the deeds of mercy recorded in the New, but most especially the record of the Sa- viour's resurrection-record that well befitted the day. There was no need of a hymn-book, for Rose knew an exhaustless store by heart, and the children had copied her example. Dear and hallowed hours were those thus spent! in- vigorating alike to body and spirit. Oh, censure not, stern moralist, those happy, healthful rambles through the forest aisles! "The groves were God's first temples ;" and what place so befitting to read the revelation of His will, or ponder its requirements, as in the presence of the beauty and the grandeurwith which His bounteous hand adorns the earth? "I am sure, mamma," said Rose, on one of these occasions, "I never knew the worth of Sunday so well in all my life." "I might say the same," replied Mrs. Carleton. "And yet I do not think it is merely the rest from toil, unknown to us before, that causes the feeling. I have always thought that, to the poor-of course, I do not mean the wretched- the Lord's Day must come clothed with a pecu- liar and sacred beauty not seen by others." "Yes," said Rose, "where there is no dread of the morrow, but a calm and even round of duties, the mind ought to be much freer to dwell   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I65 on higher things, than if occupied by the dispo- sal of riches. Not but that riches are very well in their way," she added, laughing, "if one but knew how to. use them aright. Yet I would not choose to be wealthy. I think Pope's definition of earthly happiness is almost perfect--' Health, peace, and competence.'" "May your wish be fulfilled, my pet!" said her mother, kissing her. "But to return to what we were speaking of. I even think that on the day especially devoted to His service, those who work for their daily bread must, in reflecting on Christ's life, feel a deeper sympathy with its humble details than any one else." "Yes, mamma, I am sure I see more beauty in them now than hitherto. Yet, may not that very feeling spring from a species of selfish- ness?" "How -do you contrive to make that out, Rose?" questioned her mother, smiling. "Why, may there not be a tinge of egotism in the fact of our not appreciating the condescension of accepting such a life until placed in an humble  rank ourselves? Do n't you think it might lead to an undue exaltation of that part of His history merely because it brought our own lot more into notice?" "No, my love," answered Mrs. Carleton; "I can not think so for a moment. It is rather one , x     I66  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. of the gracious compensations allowed to the world's toilers. The wealthy and the great can imitate the beauty of His beneficence, and have a fuller sense, perhaps, from their own pleasure in a small share of the treasures of the universe, of the largeness of His love, who forsook the power and bliss of so high an estate to accom- plish man's redemption; but the poor are granted to feel a nearer, dearer fellowship in His human- ity, and rejoice more deeply as they read of His tender alleviation of woes which poverty makes doubly wretched; and, doubtless, the judgment bestowed of old applies to them still, that' the common people heard him gladly,' for a chord was touched in their hearts, and vibrated in ready answer, when the learned Pharisee and wealthy Sadducee were cold and mute." "But, then, mamma, if their circumstances were such as not to excite those feelings so readily, they were less to blame." "No, my dear; they had other and equal ad- vantages that should have led to their accepting Him as the Messiah, from their ability to exam- ine the law and the prophets, and see whether these things were so. Nor do I mean to say that any human being is so placed as to be inca- pable of appreciating any part of the Saviour's life or teaching, but some may be more easily impressed than others."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     167 "Still," replied Rose, "what you have said does not altogether satisfy me, that we may not be carrying the feeling of grateful adr- .aiOn at the lowly phase of life in which Christ chose to manifest himself, too far, from an unacknowl- edged sense of pleasure in our own rank being thus brought forward." 'There is one very sure test, my darling," answered Mrs. Carleton, "as to the correctness of our religious thoughts: do they lead our minds to dwell on Christ, and influence our actions so as to follow his teachings? then, whether the apparent origin of thqm be our daily life or not, they must purify our character; more than all, they must have His approbation, w!Ss a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Oh, my dear Rose, let us not, from a mistaken idea of duty, reject these aids to a better life! rather let us fearlest the cares of this world, if not the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and render it unfruitful." * She spoke with a tender and earnest solem. nity; and Rose kissed her, with tears in her eyes, saying, softly, "Thank you, dear mamma! I am sure you must be right." "But how late it is!" exclaimed Mrs. Carle- ton, after a short silence. "And see where the children have strayed since we quit talking!     I68  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Call to them, Rose; it is time we were going home." "We have stolen your hour, haven't we, Kate?" she added, smiling, as they came run- ning, in obedience to their sister's summons. "But never mind; you shall have it in the evening, after tea." And so saying, they all descended the hill toward home.   CHAPTER XI. Not thankful when it pleaseth me, As if Thy blessings had spare days, But such a heart whose pulse may be Thy praise. Herbert. "MOST three years have fled since that conversation in the autumn woods; years not unmarked by clouds as well as sunshine to the little group then assembled. And what are the changes that have befallen them? Let us take a walk down the principal street of Green Hollow, this bright spring morning, and try, whether we can not discover. If the progress of the village be any token of that of the family who made it their home, we have no need to fear'ill news as the reward of our search, for the place has enlarged its borders on every side, and merits rather the name of town, instead of the old cognomen. (109)     170  ROSE CARLETON'S REIVARD. As we pass Mr. Breton's store, we notice that it has been extended to twice its original size, and that it is thronged with customers; while a long line of various country vehicles-for this is market day-stand before the door. Many new buildings, too, claim our attention as we pass onward. Most of them are improve- ments on the old, the only object which seems to have successfully resisted Time's alterations being the old stage office-as shabby, as dark, as uninviting in every respect as on the evening when the Carleton's first entered Green Hollow. Doubtless the inhabitants regard it as too tem- porary an abode to merit improvement. When they attain to the dignity of a railroad station, indeed, it will then be necessary to show a spirit of public enterprise; but that is still some years in the distance, though many enthusiastic minds are already discussing it. The little inn has shared in the general pros- perity, and presents a much brighter, busier aspect than when we first saw it. But here is the street where, if they still dwell in their old abode, we should find the family of whom we are in search. There is a delicious breath of fragrance in the air, and we catch glimpses of showers of pink and snowy blossoms in the little gardens behind the pretty cottages, lining either side as we walk down the pavement.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    171 But can this prettiest of them all be the for- lorn, dilapidated building in which the emigrants found refuge three years ago? Yes, truly, for here comes one through the doorway whom we well know; and Rose's manner, as she walks down the area path, sufficiently indicates the dweller, not the guest. Frank himself, I sus- pect, lacking her presence to guide him, would scarcely recognize his old home, were he to be- hold it now. The landlord has painted and re- paired the house and fence, and the look of neatness and comfort bestowed by the change seems marvelous. The little area which Kate and Nora have taken under their special care is blooming and radiant with flowers. Early roses and sweet-briar twine around the door- way, and many a simple denizen of the forest,. wooed into greater beauty by careful culture, adorns the small space allotted to their growth. One flower is the special pride and delight of Nora; and no wonder, for its peer' was never seen in the village before-a beautiful lily, which Mr. Breton had brought to her as a present, on his return from the East, the previ- ous summer. Woe to the hand that should dare to covet its loveliness, in return for the generous impulse which prompted her to bless the pass- ers-by with a sight of her treasure! But no such fear disturbed the owner. Rose's little pupils     172  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. would have suffered almost any thing before committing such a theft, and their influence re- strained and educated many who would other- wise have been prone to mischief. The little garden behind the house, its trees loaded with blossoms; and the beds,' neatly laid out, already showing signs of vegetation; the broad walk ex- tending the whole length, and narrower ones branching off to right and left, smooth and hard, where not a weed dares to intrude-shows that appreciation for the beautiful has not led to neg- lect for the useful. And yet, nine families out of ten, entering that house under the same circumstances as did the Carletons, would most probably have left it in a worse condition than they found it. And why?  Because, alas! too many sacrifice the present to the future, deeming it of little mo- ment, in the mad race after gain, to adorn and make pleasant their daily life. So thought not Mrs. Carleton; to her view, it seemed quite as important that her children should have a happy home, and cultivate the amenities of social life, for these years of their earthly existence as for any in the future; and an evidence of Rose's entire sympathy in this feeling was given by her argument in favor of observing the first New- year after their arrival-not that they did not know the value and need of pecuniary progress.;   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    17-3 no family in the place practiced a truer econo- my  no table furnished viands more simple; no girls wore plainer dresses, or spent less means on personal enjoyment, or toiled with steadier energy, than did Rose and her sisters; yet that repressive system which regards nothing as of so much value as mere money, found no shelter beneath that roof. Perfect freedom-the higli- est type of law-was the atmosphere" they breathed, and it needed but the hint of a neces- sary privation to insure a cheerful and ready acceptance; for, as none of the innocent, natu- ral yearnings of their young hearts were denied manifestation, when possible, denial did not chafe or irritate with the\ knowledge that an arbitrary command alone intervened between them and the object of their wishes. Nay, so entirely and beautifully was the happiness of all that of each, that no idea of self-sacrifice ever entered their thoughts even when they were really fulfilling it in action. Oh, infinitely better than any attainment of wealth, the sweet, calm memories of such a home! trial and enjoyment, which love ever transfigured, linking heart to heart! No young spirit crushed and broken. in the vain struggle for that which satisfieth not when in possession -no terrible awakening to a reality of the dross for which had been bartered life's fine gold-but     I74  ROSE CARLET'OIN'S REWARD. Heaven's own sunshine in the heart-Heaven's blessing on a life of humble trust! Nor had it been all an easy and gradual as- cent to their present position, lowly though it was. The first summer after Frank's departure had been one of peculiar trial and hardship. A severe drought had blasted the farmers' hopes of a good crop, and given rise to much anxiety about means with which to meet the coming winter; many, beginning, as is too often the case, to economize at the wrong end, withdrew their children for a time from Rose's school, and it was soon reduced to half its usual size. Mr. Breton also bore his share in the general disas- ter; his custom fell off sensibly, indeed; he scarcely felt justified in continuing to employ Rose, at least at the rate of compensation he had lately fixed on, but, seeing her increasing difficulties, he could not find it in his heart to discourage her still further; and how glad he was, when the tide turned, that he had not yielded to the temptation-how amply repaid by their happiness and thanks! But the crowning misfortune was still to come; the intense heat, combined with anxiety, threw the indefatigable young toiler into. a fever; and many and sorrowful were the days and nights which Mrs. Carleton spent, in trem- bling hope and fear, beside the bed of her best-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     175 beloved child. Mrs. Lee shared her vigils, and, next to the fond mother and sisters, no heart beat with truer joy when they welcomed the sufferer back to life again. Rose had, indeed,. established herself more firmly than she imag- ined in the affections of the farmer's wife; yet it was a love that could have given the absent daughter no slightest emotion of jealousy, for, far from supplanting her, it was her memory which had been its first and lasting impulse. The summer was almost over before Rose was able again to take her place at her accus- tomed tasks, and they must have suffered se- verely for want of means during her long con- valescence, had they not possessed a remnant of the sum remaining when they arrived at Green Hollow to fall back upon. Poor Rose! this tedious illness was a trial she had never antici- pated, and it was from no indifference, or inca- pability to appreciate all its hardships, that she bore it with such beautiful humility--a humility higher than patience, for it not only accepted, but trusted. "I am afraid, my love," said her mother, one, day during her recovery, when they had been tracing the causes of her illness, "I am afraid I let you work entirely too hard; we must be , more careful in future." "No, mamma," replied Rose, gently, "I liked j     176  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. to work, and it did me good; if any thing about it helped to make me ill, it was rather worrying because I had too little, than exhaustion with too much. And oh, how very wrong I was!" she went on-"how very, very wrong not to have felt'what a great and precious blessing health is!" "( Ah, Rose!" answered Mrs. Carleton, " who of us do realize it as we should, while we have it? But as to you, my pet, if you did .err in this, I am sure it was only because of the full- ness of your affection for me and the children." "Oh, mamma, I wonder at myself, now that I think of it-as if every thing lay in these poor hands! Did I not believe that, if I was taken away, God could supply my place? Besides, there was no real ground for feeling so disturbed when we were all well and happy; the difficulty could scarcely fail to soon pass." "Well, dear," replied her mother, "admitting what you say, atone for it now by not being too anxious about getting well, now when you are on the fair road to health again, for that would be sure to retard it, and you will soon make good lost time when you take up your work. After all, Rose, darling," she added, stooping to kiss'her, " maybe we both stood in need of the lesson, to remind us-what we might have been in danger of forgetting-how dependent we are   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    177  on the bounty and protection of our Heavenly Father." ' Nor did Rose disappoint her; she neither  weakly lamented over the time lost, nor made too great haste to recover it, but followed the i "golden mean " that-lay between, taking up her school and attendance at the store, as usual, cheerful and content, her heart overflowing with thankfulness that life and health were spared. Her school still showed diminished numbers throughout the ensuing winter; but, while Frank would have been ready, in similar cir- cumstances, to throw aside the work in utter discouragement, and seek for employment else- where-feeling every month, from his want of success, twice as long as it really was-she, with the clear eye of faith, kept ever looking for the break in the clouds which she knew must come, well assured that the Arm on which she leaned in humble trust would not leave her helpless. Nor did He, in whose sight the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is of great price, try her beyond her strength. With the dawn of spring, her life also began to brighten. Mrs. Carleton had, through the influence of Mr. Lee and Mr. Breton, with a few others, procured the situation of postmis- tress; and though the remuneration was small, it was still a help. The duties were light, and - 12   .     178  ROSE CAARLETON'g RItEVARD. Kate soon became an able assistant; besides, their house being situated near the stage-office, her new employment did not call her from home, for a part of one of the rooms was set aside for this purpose, Frank's absence having left more space in the small abode. The sum- mer, too, proved an unusually prosperous one to the farmers, and made ample amends fot the misfortunes of the last; Rose's school was again filled to overflowing, and grew more popular than ever. She had gradually altered it so as to only devote two mornings in the week to sewing -sometimes ornamental, sometimes plain; the- other days were taken up with the study of the ordinary branches of education-reading, writ- ing, arithmetic, etc.; this met the wishes of the parents more fully, and agreeably varied her toil. New residents had, from time to time, made Green Hollow their home since Frank's departure, but this second summer had been re- markable for the numerous arrivals; and before the winter was over, Rose's little school-room was found altogether too small to accommodate the crowd of children who sought admission. Accordingly, after mature deliberation, she re- solved to rent a room in a more central part of the village, and remove her little flock thither; the change was advantageous in many respects -it gave her the power of taking a greater   ROSE IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM.

ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    179 number of pupils, and left the family more pri- vacy; besides, her mother was now able to, establish the post-office in the vacant school- room, which was much more convenient for the purpose than the one she had hitherto used. It is thus, then, that we find them at the opening of the third spring since Frank's de- parture-Kate assisting her mother in the duties of the post-office and the housework, though in the latter, indeed, all, even Rose, lent a hand- Nora attending her sister's school, and helping, when at home, in the various ways a child can- and Rose busy as a bee in her different avoca- tions, beloved by her pupils, and esteemed by all who knew her. "How happy and blooming that girl always looks!" was the common remark of those who met her; "but it is no wonders she does her duty." Duty! I verily believe Rose never viewed her daily acts in that light, at all. To lie upon a sick bed,. and bear the want of strength and energy with humble patience-to see the privations of her dear ones, and yet commit them to a higher keeping in trustful resignation-or to have to resign her post to another-such trials might, indeed, in her eyes, merit the name of duty; but to toil for them with all her strength of body,. and heart, and soul-to spend and be spent in the service of     180  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. those she held so dear-to comfort and sustain in aught the hearts that cherished her as Heaven's sweetest gift--that was not Duty; it was Love's most sacred, most blessed privi- lege! *yCH Wegvt rc otelwy   CHAPTER XII. He giveth grace to the lowly. Proverbs. ROSE came home one evening from the store more than usually thought- ful, though the nature of her med- itations seemed to be pleasant; and her mother could not help noticing her abstraction as she took her seat at the tea-table. "You seem to be in something of a brown study, my dear," she said, playfully. "Won't you tell us what it is about?" "Yes, mamma; I was only thinking where to begin. Mr. Breton was telling me, to-day, that the principal men of the village had been con- sulting together about beginning some kind of a public school; mine, they think, is almost too small, now, to meet the wants of the growing population." "I suppose, too," added Mrs. Carleton, "that they think the other will cost less. No wonder (I8x)     182  ROSE CJARLETON'S REWARD. you looked grave, dear. I am very, sorry, for you liked the employment; and I'm sure I do n't see where they can get a teacher who will succeed better with the children than you have done." "Oh, well, mamma, I dare say I could, if we wished, still have a place in the school, for Mr. Breton said they would be very glad to put me at the head; but he proposes something else, that he thinks would be better and more inde- pendent." "I am glad to hear that," said her mother; "I do n't like the idea, at all, of resigning your own little school, where you felt perfectly free to fol- low out any system of teaching you thought best, to take a position under the control of so many directors-even though the compensation was as great as what you already receive. But tell us the new plan." "Well, mamma, you know Mr. Breton has rather a high opinion of my capability as a saleswoman--at least, he said so, to-day-and he proposes that I should anticipate the break- ing up of my school, and--" "Begin a store yourself?" interrupted Mrs. Carleton. "Yes; he says that the free-school is inevita- ble, sooner or later ; and, even if it were not so, he thinks this new employment would be far   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    183 more profitable, and more pleasant than my life at present. Of course, he means it to be a sort' of dry goods and millinery store; and, as it would be the first one in Green Hollow devoted exclusively to those two branches of trade, it might succeed very well. As to beginning now, he thinks it would be better to seem to have made the choice, instead of being forced to it." "Ah, Rose, dear," said her mother, -smiling, "these are good arguments--and I see by your and Kate's bright eyes how much you are pleased with the, plan-I like it very well my- self; it would be a grand thing if we could but do it-but there is one great difficulty: 'where is the capital to come from to start with?" "That is just the question I was sure you would ask. But do n't fear, Kate!"Rose re- plied, with' a pretty air of triumph, as she no- ticed the doubtful look on her sister's face; "I have my answer ready. Mamma, Mr. Breton is kinder even than we ever thought; he seems almost as much interested about us as though we were relations. So, when I reminded him that the little sum we have saved, added to our original means, only amounted to about two hundred dollars, he at once said that need be no obstacle to the plan, for he would be quite willing to ad- vance whatever money is necessary at the be-     184  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. ginning-charging a moderate rate of interest. For it is almost impossible, he says, for us to fail." "That is kind, indeed," said Mrs. Carleton, "and smooths the way, so far; I think it is true what he says of success, for you have a great deal of taste, Rose, in selecting and arranging all the little niceties that adorn a woman's toilet. Well, we will take a week to think it over, and ask Mr. Breton's advice more fully--I wonder that he likes to part with you." "Oh, he said he regretted it very much, but that he did not think it right not to help me to something better. But, you know, mamma, his own children -some of them, at least-will soon be able to assist him, so that my help would not be needed after- a little while; and it seems a great pity not to engage in some permanent occupation when we have the chance." "Yes, that is true, Rose," said her mother. "And then we can unite the keeping of the post-office so nicely with the store-for the same room will do for both. I will go with you, to- morrow, to Mr. Breton, to plan about it." "Oh, thank you, dear mamma!" exclaimed Rose, kissing her. "I thought you would be pleased-won't it be delightful if we succeed? And Kate and Nora can help me so much-it   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    185 will give us all employment without being sep- arated." "But, mamma," Kate broke in, blushing and trembling; "Rose will not need both Nora and me in the store. Do n't you think I could earn a little money, too, at something else?" Mother and sister looked up with a start of surprise-realizing suddenly and clearly that the: tall, graceful figure before them no longer merited the appellation of " little Kate." For a moment neither answered; and Kate, having mastered her shyness sufficiently to introduce the'subject, did not pursue it further. Rose's thoughts had strayed to the time of Frank's departure-contrasting the merry little girl of twelve, who had bidden him good-by between smiles and tears, with the fair maiden of fifteen, whose earnest eyes were searching her face. Ah, the child-sister, so dearly loved, had van- ished; but what a sweet companion-what a tender, willing helper had come in her stead! Mrs. Carleton's reverie was shorter, but took in a wider range of memories-from the time the baby Kate lay smiling in her arms, and on through all the after years of joy and trial. Oh, had not Heaven blessed her richly in the pos- session of such dutiful, such loving children-? "And so, my sweet Kate," she said, embrac- ing iher daughter with tearful but happy etno-     I86  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. tion, "you want to be one of the workers, too? Ah, dear, you have always done more than your share, here at home. But if it would really make you- happier to engage in some definite pursuit, I will not object; only you are so young, I hardly know what it could be." "It was Rose's speaking of the free-school," answered Kate, "that put it into my head. You know, mamma, you and Rose have taught me so carefully-do n't you think that maybe they would take me as one of the teachers?" "Ah, you little rogue!" said Rose, laughing. "I might have guessed that was your plan-I saw the start you gave when I spoke. Yes, Kate, I do think they would engage you as a teacher, very gladly; Mr. Breton is to be one of the directors, and he will be sure to help you. But this is April-I do not suppose the school can begin for a month or two, at least; so you will have plenty of time to prepare for it." "And you were always such a favorite among your playmates, Kate," added her mother, " that I am sure you will succeed very well with your pupils." So it was settled. Mrs. Carleton and Rose went the next evening to Mr. Breton's; and a long consultation was held concerning the new project. "You see, Rose," Mr. Breton said, kindly,   ROSE CARLETON)'S REWARD.    187 "though I would be willing to lend you twice the amount to further such an enterprise, yet I think three hundred dollars, added to what you have, will be quite enough; a small stock of goods, well assorted, will sell quite as rapidly as a large one, and you will be able to renew it more frequently; so that-your store will always have the appearance of freshness and newness- very essential to one of its character." "And how do you think the room the post- office occupies now will suit for this new pur- pose?" asked Mrs. Carleton. "Very well, indeed," replied their friend; "it will take neither much time nor expense to fit it up; your house is in a sufficiently central part of the town to not require a removal on that ac- count, and attendance on the business will be pleasanter and easier when not necessitating ab- sence from home." "But how are the goods to be selected and bought?" was Rose's difficulty, and her mother's also. "That is the very point I was coming to," answered Mr. Breton, addressing Mrs. Carleton. "I will be going to the East in a few weeks, and I was about to propose to buy the goods for Rose's store at the same with my own-if you would be pleased with the arrangement. It will save her the expense of traveling, and the goods     i88  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. can be bought cheaper. After she is fairly es- tablished in business, though, she must attend to this herself; not only that she may become known to the merchants, but because her taste in such matters can not fail to be much better than mine." "Oh, thank you, Mr. Breton!" exclaimed Rose and her mother in a breath. "How'kind you are! what would we have done without you!" "Then it is all settled," he said, as they arose to depart; and his face expressed as much pleas- ure as if he, and not they, had been the benefited party. "Tell Kate," he added, "that I will do all I can to further her interests with the school. And, Mrs. Carleton, I see no reason why the little store should not be in operation by the middle of June." "Neither do I," she answered; "you have removed all hinderances so well." "Then I will come over, the first spare mo- ment, to see what alterations will be necessary in fitting up the room, that the carpenter may begin at once. Ah, Rose!" he added, laughing, "I foresee the damage I have brought on my- self by installing you here. I need scarcely hope to see any of my fair friends after you depart. Even Mrs. Breton talks slightingly of our old store. But I am content to bear the punish- ment."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I189 And so it came to pass that that summer formed a new era in the life of the Carleton family. As Mr. Breton had proposed, Rose's little store displayed its attractions and was thronged by buyers before the month of June had passed; and Kate began her career as teacher when September ushered in the au- tumn. Prosperity attended both. And, oh! how sweet was the consciousness that no undue haste had been made to obtain it! that nothing of the peace and love of home had been sacri-. ficed in its pursuit! Surely, surely, there is a wisdom higher than mere worldly tact and skill! And they whose minds repose in calm, unshaken trust upon Him they serve, for the ordering of their future-pur- suing, meanwhile, with whole-souled energy, the requirements of the present-will ever be able, from their freedom from overwhelming anxiety that must defeat its object, to see with clearer and less biased eyes the prospect round them, and seize with readier, surer hand what fortune offers. Yet, happy and grateful as Mrs. Carleton and her daughters were in their new course of life, one dark shadow hung above them still, as if to test the faith, found perfect under poverty, with the far severer trial of uncertainty about a loved one's fate. Frank's letters had again ceased to     I90  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD, gladden their anxious hearts. His last few mes- sages had been in a despondent and unsatisfied vein; and, what was a strong evidence of this state of mind, lacked both the name of his abode and the date. So, left without any clew by which to trace his steps, what wonder that the mother's heart sank within her; that, as the weeks and months rolled by, till the year's circuit was com- pleted, and still no word or token reached them from the absent, the silver threads became more frequent amid those glossy tresses, and the lov- ing eyes grew dimmer than of yore? What wonder that his young sisters' voices had less of the ringing gladness which blended with their companions'; that a serious aspect, near akin to sadness, shadowed their fair brows; and that their stepstfell softly, as if fearing to jar upon a suffering heart? Only Rose maintained her con- fidence and hope unshaken-more so, at least, than the others; and her cheerful and sustain- ing love was a priceless blessing to them all. It was late in the twilight of the lovely June day which completed the first year of her new enterprise, that Rose entered her mother's pres- ence, with a proud yet grateful and humble heart, to lay before her the result of their toil. "Oh, mamma," she said, "a year ago we would not have dared to hope for such success! Even with the strict economy we practiced, and Kate's   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    191 help, I can scarcely understand how we have realized so much. The debt to Mr. Breton is all paid, and we have, besides, a nice little sum of money to begin the new year with. Is n't it wonderful, mamma?" "No more wonderful than that God's prom- ises to a faithful, loving child should be fulfilled," answered Mrs, Carleton, as she folded her in a fond embrace. "Blessings on your head, sweet daughter! And, oh, that my poor Frank had but possessed your patient, humble spirit! For, ah, Rose, my heart misgives me that his leaving Green Hollow was a fatal, fatal step!" Bright tears fell from Rose's eyes, for the day recalled sad memories; it was the anniversary of the one on which her brother had left them. A wish to connect their lives, though separate, by some tie, had made her choose that date for the beginning of her business life; as if the two who had walked so long with clasped hands had, at the same moment, loosed their hold, to ven- ture, for each other's sake, into new fields of promise. Nor had the choice been made with- out an undefined, sweet, and sacred hope that the day which had parted would yet reunite them. "Dear mamma," she said, "do not weep; it breaks my heart to see you! I feel, somehow, so sure that Frank will return when the five     192  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. years are over. We know he would not break his promise; and it always seems to me as if God had not meant this separation to last through life, but only for a time, to make dear Frank and all of us better and happier in the future. And, oh, mamma, if we prosper as we are doing now, I almost dare to think that when he does return-for he surely, surely will! and what a recompense for all these years it would be!-I almost dare to think that we will be able to-to-" But here her voice broke off tremulously, and, kneeling down by her mother's side, with her arms still caressing her, she whispered some- thing softly in her ear, something that made her sweet young face radiant through its tears. What it was, we shall discover by and by,   CHAPTER XIII. - Do not linger with regretting, Or, for passing hours despond; Nor, the daily toil forgetting, Look too eagerly beyond. A. A. Proctor. ND, meanwhile, what has become of Frank? how has he sped in the new life on which we left him just entering? -For a time he wrought with a good courage, and steady, @9  faithful energy, deserving of all praise. The lesson of the folly of impatience, learned so lately, and at so great a cost, could not be soon nor easily forgotten; and many months passed before he acknowl- edged to himself that his old feelings held a sway as powerful as ever. Nevertheless, it was the truth. With the lapse of time came new difficulties and discouragements, that his eager spirit was ill fitted to encounter. His kind landlady, of whom we have caught a glimpse, 13            (I93)     194  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. removed to another place, and with her depart- ure faded out what little sunshine had gladdened his toilsome life. Under her roof he had met with the semblance, at least, of the home-love and sympathy for which his heart yearned; but cast adrift now, as one in a crowded boarding- house, he had no such comfort to lean on. I have said before that there was nothing bright or pleasant in his business life to atone for such a want. That long, dark store-room, filled with merchandise, dreary and cold in win- ter, sultry and dusty in summer, was a sad abode to which to consign youth and hope. There was no companionship possible with his fellow-work- ers; their employer was but a task-master, never troubling himself about their welfare further than to exact the work required of them; and they, in turn, were, through business hours, the mere patient machines of his will, stealing off, when night came, to some rude scene of boisterous mirth, with no desire higher than that transient enjoyment. Yet, can we blame them? It is right that every one should bear his part in the world's great work-shop. But alas! that man should make doubly a curse, the decree which might have been transformed into a blessing! Can we expect one who bends under the yoke of in- cessant toil, from the first gray glimmer of dawn   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I95 to the last glimpse of sunset in the western sky, to delight in improving and cultivating his men- tal powers when the day's toil is over-leaving body and mind alike unequal to such a'task? Ah, we may, in our self-sufficient ignorance, marvel that the poor man should not make an effort to rise above his lot-rather let us marvel that he does not fall lower still! To Frank, the pursuits and pleasures of his companions held out no allurements; his early training had left too deep an impression on mind and heart'to allow him to sink to their level; but his lonelier situation was attended by temp- tation more subtile, and as strong. Rose's words were ever echoing in his brain: "Is it. not worth while-even supposing that change would hasten your object-to be content that it should be delayed a few years, when that delay gives us the delight of each other's presence?" He acknowledged how truly she had spoken, now, as day after day, through those dreary winter months, he fulfilled his monotonous round of duties-as night after night he climbed the stairs to his cold, dark, garret room, and flung his weary frame upon the bed. How dif- ferent from this had been his life at Green Hol- low-the kind and friendly intercourse with Mr. Breton-the sweet home-welcome every night! But it was too late now to lament the past.     I96  ROSE CARLE'TON'S REWIVARD. So he said and thought, though he might well have known that the true path to take was still open as ever to his feet. But he could not bear to entertain the idea, for a moment, that he had lost in vain endeavors almost a whole year. "Which would really be so," he reflected, "were I to go home now. No, no; I must make my present situation a stepping-stone to something better, here." And it is but just to say that, had he felt him- self in any degree nearer the attainment of his object, the disagreeableness of his surroundings would have mattered little; for he constantly said to himself that the aim of his toil should ennoble it to him, however averse he might feel to encountering it. Had he applied this logic a few months earlier, it might have saved him from the first false step, and all its consequences. Nevertheless, the character of his daily life could not fail to influence, more or less, his de- sire for changing it; for, however much theory might tell him of how little moment was the manner in which the intervening years were passed, if he but attained his object in the end, Nature-a far truer, though more silent guide- ever contradicted it. So it was, that in search- ing for some better employment, while keeping in view, with more earnestness than ever, the grand end to be sought, he yet, almost uncon-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    I97 sciously, allowed his choice to be influenced, more than formerly, by the accompanying sur- roundings. Strange to say, the tidings he re- ceived from time to time, of the progress of events at home, served but to increase his aversion to a return. Rose had vainly hoped that the knowledge of her success might have led to the thought that life in Green Hollow was not such a stagnant affair, after all; and better worth trying than he had at first sup- posed; but it led him to resolutions altogether different. All his pride and energy were roused to new strength: "What! should it be said that a timid girl, confronting the world for the first time, had yet succeeded, in the obscurity of a country village, in accomplishing what he had vainly attempted in a wider field of action? Surely, surely, this must never be! Unworthy of a brother's name, did he suffer to fall on her slight shoulders the whole burden of such a task!" The first year of his absence from home had passed, when he exchanged his old situation for one a little more lucrative;' full of the high hopes in which he had always indulged when entering on a new path. Surely, he would be able now to add, more rapidly than hitherto, to his small amount of savings. But he soon found that new expenditures bid fair to exhaust     I98   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. his little store. His wardrobe, which had not been replenished since he left home, could no longer be neglected; and he looked with alarm on the required outlay, although, compared with his companions-for the establishment was a much larger and more fashionable one than he had left-his attire was almost meager. "What a fool Carleton is," he overheard one of them say, " to work like a slave and dress like a miser-as if a person in a situation could hope to amass any thing worth!" "He has a mother and sisters partially de- pendent on him, I believe," replied the other; "and it is on, their account he is so anxious. Besides-I was talking with him the other day -even if they were not in the case, he has a great desire to be independent, to be his own master, though it might be in a very humble way." Nonsense!" said the first speaker, laughing. "What is the good of independence if you have to drudge all your life to attain it?" "That is true, Fred; and yet I think he is half right. It is a miserable life for any man of spirit to look forward to-that of 'situa- tions.' "Oh, I do n't know," was the careless answer. "Any way, I do n't see how Carleton is going to mount higher than the rest of us-or as 'high.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    199 Get through life with the least toil and most pleasure you'can, is my maxim. He might as well be content, first as last, for his mother and sisters to fare as well as they can, and enjoy himself a little-like the rest of us. Depend upon it, that is the way he will soon come to look, at it." They passed on; but their words sank deep into their listener's heart. All the honest man- hood of his soul scorned the selfish counsel he had heard, and clung, with more tenacity than ever, to its olden moorings; but a desolate sense of doubt-of lost confidence in his own power to achieve that for which he panted--over- whelmed him, and darkened all the future to his gaze. Still, no vision crossed his mind of how esteemed and beloved, even though filling a subordinate place, he' would have been in Green Hollow; nor how surely, though it might have seemed very slowly to his ardent spirit, would he have ascended to the position he coveted. Another year of discontent and little progress passed away thus; impatience was beginning to give place to a listless apathy, that despaired of success, though pride prevented the open be- trayal of this in his letters home-how long it seemed since he left them-and how far in the distance, like an impossible dream, the thought     200   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. of his return-when an incident occurred, which changed the whole current of his life; and filled his heart again with hope and trust in an over- watching Providence. It was one of those bright, delicious, balmy April days which seem the very poetry of spring time, and bring vague yearnings for green fields and opening violets. It was noon, and there was a lull in the ceaseless traffic of the city. Frank stood in the doorway of the store, gazing carelessly up and down the street, when a sud- den shriek pierced the momentary quiet, and directly there came, with flying feet, down the middle of the thoroughfare, a run-away horse- the white foam blown back like snow-flakes from his mouth, and his eyes sparkling with terror; scattering to right and left, in his mad flight, horror-stricken women and crying children. But one sight riveted Frank's attention far more than all this wild dismay. A lady stood on the opposite sidewalk, speechless, and white with agony-her hands stretched out, in vain entreaty, toward a little boy standing irreso- lute in the very track of the maddened animal, now but a few paces distant. The child seemed powerless to retreat, overcome by that fascina- tion of danger that acts like a spell on all capa- bility of motion. No one but Frank seemed to take heed of this little scene amid the general   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    201 turmoil; and, with scarce a second's. hesitation, he flew with eager generosity to the rescue. To rush through the crowd collected on the sidewalk-to clasp the affrighted child in his arms, while the steed's hot breath already fanned his cheek-to bear him to her who stood waiting in bitterest anguish-all this, how long it seemed in passing! and yet what a moment it really was! Then Frank looked up-to see the horse's progress stayed at the bottom of the street-and to find those kind, womanly eyes, suffused by tears, lifted to his face, as though it had been an angel's. The little boy clung, half fainting, to her hand; and Frank besought her to rest for awhile in the store, before proceeding. His employer, meanwhile, had heard of the accident, and came forward, well pleased, to offer his con- gratulations, and what trifling hospitalities he could; then, as he and the lady fell into conver- sation, Frank modestly withdrew, and rejoined his companions in, the salesroom. "You're in luck  to-day, Carleton, sure enough!" cried Fred. A. "Why, the family is one of the richest in the town! Ah, I only wish I stood in your shoes!" Frank colored, and turned away; it was the first time he had thought of his action in con- nection with any reward; and all the feelings     202  ROSE CARLETON'S .REWARD. which had prompted him revolted at the coarse- ness of the speech. "I would have done the same for a beggar!" he said to himself, indig- nantly. "But, seriously, Frank," said, in a friendly whisper, the voice he had overheard talking with Fred. A., "though I think it is very fool- ish to build much on people's gratitude, still it may lead to something for you; and do n't be too proud, my boy, to accept it if it should!" Frank laughed, and shook his head, saying there was little fear of his being called on to exercise humility. Soon after, his employer came in-the lady having gone-and compli- mented him for his tact and courage; and so the matter dropped, without further comment, for the time.   CHAPTER XIV. Thy greeting smile was pledge and prelude Of generous deeds and kindly words; In thy large heart were fair guest-chambers, Open to sunrise and the birds! Whittier. HREE    or four days had passed, A 3 when, one morning, Frank saw, t  entering the store, a gentleman, accompanied by a little boy, whom he at once recognized as the child he had lately rescued. He heard the stranger ask for the proprietor of the establishment; and, as they engaged in earnest talk, in which he thought his own name mingled once or twice, shrunk back from sight as much as possible, lest he should seem to court obser-  vation, while his heart beat loud and fast. But he could not so easily elude the search- ing gaze of the child, who glanced anxiously round the room as if in quest of some familiar face. (203)     204  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "Oh, there he is, father!" he cried, joyfully, as his eye caught Frank's. "Do come! do come!" and with all his little might he sought to draw his father away in the direction he wished. "Well, I suppose I must follow this impatient fellow's lead!" the gentleman said, smiling; "I am much obliged to you, Mr. West, for the in- formation you have given me. No, thank you; I will not disturb you when so busy; Louis seems to remember Mr. Carleton very well, and I can introduce myself." So saying, he yielded to his son's importuni- ties, and walked across the room to where Frank stood. "Mr. Carleton, I believe?" he said, cordially, holding out his hand, which clasped Franks with a warm pressure. "My name is Greyson. I suppose you have not forgotten this youngster who has been so anxious to make your acquaint- ance?"The light tone dropped, and the father's voice shook, as he continued: "Oh, sir, I can never be grateful enough to you for saving my child from such a fate! Will you let me be your friend?" The boy stood by, looking at Frank-timid and joyful-with humid eyes, as all the agony of that frightful day came back to him again. "You exaggerate the service, sir," Frank an-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    205 swered, modestly; "I was only too happy to render assistance; I hope the little boy is not any the worse?  "Oh, no!" his father said, laughing; "his looks speak for that! But I would like to have a long talk with .you-can not you oblige my wife and me by spending to-morrow with us? She will be so glad to see you; and Mr. West, I know, will not object. We live two or three miles out of the city; and, if you like, I will call round this evening as I am going home, and take you up in the buggy." Frank accepted, with many thanks, the hospi- ,tality offered, though not, it must be confessed, without much trepidation of mind concerning the new scenes into which he was to be intro- duced; and the evening found Mr. Greyson punctual to his promise. A pleasant drive of half an hour, enlivened by agreeable conversation, brought them to their journey's end, and Franksfound himself at once, as it were, in the midst of old friends. The lady who had accompanied the child on that memorable day was not, as Frank had supposed, his mother, but her sister, who joined their circle the next morning. It would be hard to tell whether mother or aunt was most grateful-  the child was so tenderly loved by both ; and to have carried the tidings of such a disaster to a     206   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. home so happy, would have been a fate more to be dreaded than death itself. Kind as Mr. Greyson's manner had been, his wife's was still more so; and Frank soon felt quite at home with his new friends. Grateful, indeed, to the hungry heart that had been so long lonely, was the refined and sympathetic intercourse of this delightful .evening; and Frank's delicacy of feeling rejoiced in such a return of his service, more than in any ostensi- ble reward. But Mr. Greyson had no idea of resting contented with mere professions of ob- ligation and friendship, and determined to bene- fit his young guest in some more tangible form -not by the bestowal of a definite recompense, large or small, too often intended as a stop to all further demands on gratitude-his purpose was wiser and more liberal. He saw Frank young, and struggling to obtain a livelihood, and thought-as all true helpers ever think- that the surest way to aid another is to enable him to aid himself. So, wishing to discover, if possible, in what direction Frank's need of assistance lay, he drew him into the garden, after breakfast, the following morning, that they might have a quiet conversation, unembarrassed by the presence of others. As they walked up and down the paths, observing the progress of the fresh vege-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD,    207 tation, their remarks naturally flowed into the channel of agriculture; and Mr. Greyson felt equally delighted and surprised at the knowl- edge, practical and theoretic, Frank almost un- consciously displayed on the subject. "You must have followed these pursuits a long time, or be very well read in them-or both?" he questioned, not concealing his admi- ration. He was really quite an enthusiastic amateur gardener himself, and altogether able to sympathize with the passion in another. Frank flushed with pleasure at the unexpected praise, while Memory's ready tears brightened his eyes for a moment. "My father had a very fine farm," he an- swered, "and spared no pains to give me the best instructions in agriculture; it is to his care I owe what little knowledge I possess." "And how long is it since you left it?" asked Mr. Greyson. "Only a year or two," Frank answered; and then briefly gave his sad, short history, uncon- sciously revealing in the narration the simple aspirations of his heart. A new light dawned on Mr. Greyson's mind; he turned and took Frank's hand: "My dear young friend," he said, " believe, in what I am about to say, I have no intention to humble or wound you; but it would be wrong     208  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. to slight this opportunity for speaking. Pardon me when I say that the situation you are in now is not at all, in my view, the one for which you are best suited. You long for the fresh air and freedom of a country life; I want to propose such to you. I have often felt the need of an educated man-one whose influence with my children (for they could not fail to be much in his company) I need not fear-to take the con- trol of my grounds; they have never been cul- tivated as they should. Such a man, from our short acquaintance, I believe you to be-would you like the employment?" Frank's sparkling eyes answered for him; and Mr. Greyson went on, without waiting for a reply: "Of course, I would not intend that you should do the actual work-unless a few, par- ticular, light jobs-but merely to oversee and direct, and have your ideas carried out. There is another thing I would like; you have seen my two little boys? They are too young to send to school, if I wished it. I think you must have had a good education; and I would be glad for them to spend two hours with you, each day, in learning the rudimentary branches. But I have been forgetting all this time to speak of remuneration! What is your present salary?' Frank named the sum.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    '209 "I will make it half as much again," replied his friend; "are you agreed?" "I am  delighted!" stammered Frank. "You are too kind." "That is enough, then!" said Mr. Greyson, as pleased as he. "Let us shake hands on it- only do n't call benefiting myself, kindness. And now, before we go, let me entreat you, my dear Carleton, not to refuse accepting this slight token of the esteem and gratitude my wife and I feel toward you." He drew from its receptacle a handsome gold watch, and laid it in Frank's hand. "I can not refuse," he said, with emotion, "though there was no merit in what I did; it shall be a precious memento all my life." His friend marked the tremulous working of his mouth, and kindly brought the conversation to a close by saying: "It is growing hot,; shall we not return to the house? Mrs. Greyson will be wondering what has become of us." So they slowly sauntered back to the cheerful drawing-room and its mistress's pleasant com- pany. And thus the next week Frank entered on his beloved vocation. The life he had wished for, so long in vain, opened before him now, under the happiest auspices, and his spirits rose accord- ingly. Never had his letters to his mother and I4     210  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Rose been written in a vein so hopeful and con- tented; and never, since he left them, had he had such real cause for these feelings. A happy and a truly Christian home it was, to whose society he was now welcomed, for master and mistress both treated and regarded him rather as a friend and companion than as one in their employ; and, knit together by the same religious beliefs and aspirations, nothing disturbed the harmony of their intercourse. Though blessed with a liberal share of this world's goods, there was no ostentatious display of wealth in the household, but a reasonable and natural enjoyment of the comforts and adorn- fments of life. With them, Christianity was lived as well as believed; the unity and affection among the different members of the family, the cheerful and obedient temper of the children, the absence of all wish for other than the sim- plest pleasures, the kind and just beneficence exercised toward those in need, the calm delight in sacred things, which made the Lord's Day indeed the pearl of days to them, but animated all the week as well-surely the life of such a household was an exemplar to all, that the fruit of the Spirit is, truly, "love, joy, peace!" Next to the shelter of his own home, no more blessed or safe retreat could have fallen to Frank's lot; and, as day succeeded day, his satisfaction   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    2" and pleasure in his new life increased. Now, at last, in his true sphere, was he understood and appreciated. And, as he marked the steady ac- cumulation of his little hoard, and thought of those who loved him, far away, his heart bounded with picturings of the future. Nor were Mr. and Mrs. Greyson less charmed on their part. As they watched Frank's faithful energy in all he undertook, and became more convinced, the better they knew him, of the strong sense of right and truth which governed him, they said to one another, "We have found a treasure." No more lonely evenings for the young toiler now for father and mother and children soon grew to feel that something was wanting to the general happiness, if Frank was not present in the little circle gathered in the parlor after tea. With the children he had, indeed, succeeded admirably, almost as well as with his favorite gardening; and Mr. Greyson and his wife rightly felt that one who, benefited them was, in the highest sense, their friend. His little pupils were much attached to him, especially Louis; and many a delightful evening did they all pass together in reading and conversation. They were engaged thus, in the twilight of a summer day, when one of the children' came running in from the lawn, full of jbyous excite-     212  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. ment, holding something in his hand. It proved to be a valuable penknife, which Mr. Greyson had missed for some days, and the little fellow had been indefatigable in trying to find. "Well, Philip," said his father, pleasantly, "I think it is only fair you should have the knife, as a reward for your faithful search." "Oh, may I, papa?" the child cried, delight- edly, and ran to show his gift to his mother. "Do you see, Philip," some one said, play- fully, "that honesty is the best policy?" "I do n't suppose he had any thought of hon- esty or dishonesty in the case," said Mr. Grey- son. "But what do you thTnk of that proverb, Frank?" he added, turning to him. "I was just wishing to ask you the same question," he replied. "Well," said his friend, "I can not say I have ever thought very highly of it." "Why not, Mr. Greyson?" exclaimed a visitor, in surprise. "I have always regarded it as one of the best of these old sayings." "Many people, no doubt, lopk on it so," answered her host, "but it certainly is not one that should have any influence on a Chris- tian's conduct; and to inculcate the virtue on children by such arguments, seems to me a sad outrage on their purity and straightforwardness of thought."    ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    213 "Yet it is very often introduced into books designed for children's reading." "True; and simply because the idea is so prevalent that a child can not be good, save from interested motives. -Why not teach them to love the right for the right's sake? And of what ac- count is rectitude of conduct that springs from any other source? I would not risk any thing on the integrity of a man who based his honesty on its being the best policy-would you, Frank?" "No," he answered, "surely not; for if it should prove to be, as it might, not the best policy, what assurance could you have?" "And there is another objection to such teaching," interposed Mrs. Greyson, joining in the conversation, " that it really is not true. As to the proverb in question, honesty is not the ,best policy in many cases. A large proportion -of success in business is owing to a directly op- posite course of conduct; and, unless your view extends beyond this life, experience proves, such a maxim to be, at least, not a perfect guide. Then, ,why build morality on so unstable a foundation? For, assuredly, when the waves of adversity beat against it, great will be its fall." "And it is my belief," said her husband, again taking up the thread of discourse, " that children naturally incline to and love the right, if they are but properly dealt with. And, oh! what a sad     214  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. and pitiful mistake to vitiate a fresh young mind by such selfish teaching, when the purest instruc- tions of Heaven itself have been graciously given to our hands!" "Well," said the visitor, "these are certainly novel views; but you almost convince me, so spare me further argument." More than a year passed tranquilly over Frank's head in this happy abode. He had no desire to change his lot. He had fairer pros- pects of attaining the object of his ambition than ever hitherto, and nothing better inter- posed to tempt him away. His savings amounted to quite a considerable sum for one in his cir- cumstances, and he looked forward with cheerful anticipations to the future, feeling that when he should return home, at the end of the five years, he would have no reason to be ashamed of his experiment in seeking a fortune. But, alas! goodness and worth are not exempt from the common lot of humanity, and Frank saw clouds, dark and heavy, gather over the friends who had been so true. With the begin- ning of his second year's sojourn among them, came loss of means and bitter grief; for the mother's presence passed away from her stricken children, the homestead was claimed by stran-   ROSE CARL ETON'S REWARD.   215 gers, the lonely father gathered his little ones about him, and entered with them on new scenes;--the pleasant days were over, and Frank was adrift once more.     CHAPTER XV. One by one thy duties wait thee, Let thy whole strength go to each, Let no future dreams elate thee, Learn thou first what these can teach. A. A. Proctor. OW, whither should his footsteps bend?   Affection and prudence both  whispered- "Homeward!" But though his heart leaped at the thought of meeting those he loved, inclination did not second their entreaty. Frank's eyes were not yet opened to see how little of his late success was owing to effort or wisdom of his own. True, his faithfulness and skill had certainly secured to him the blessing which Providence bestov*, and this was much; but when his mind went back to his first acquaintance with Mr. Greyson, he could form no idea of what his future course would have been had not that for- tunate accident interposed. Nothing but the (216)   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    217 same wandering, dissatisfied life he had led up to that point seemed possible; yet was not that the very life which opened before him now, if firm in his resolution not to return home? Such, to one who viewed it soberly, might seem the case; but not so did it appear to him. Two years of the five for which he had stipu- lated still lay before him. What might he not, with his present advantages, accomplish in that time? And why should he, just when fortune became favorable, relinquish this opportunity? With the means he had acquired, he could now afford to wait awhile and look about him, nor be too rash in accepting a situation, when able to command, to some extent, his own terms. Yet, spite of all this sanguine reasoning, he hesitated long before deciding'. Sincere and deep had been his-attachment to Mr. Greyson and his family; and keen the grief, and heart- felt the sympathy he had in their misfortunes; no marvel, then, if his thoughts turned with painful longing toward his own beloved home, when the ties, which had for a time partially filled its place, were so, rudely severed. Very dear and tempting was the vision of the com- fort and love that he knew awaited him-of the welcoming kisses and fond delight!-and the struggle was hard ere he laid it aside. Rose's last letter had informed him of the commence-     218  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. ment of her business enterprise, and its promise of success; it reached him in the midst of his indecision, and, for an instant, he had almost taken the true resolve. His life at Mr. Grey- son's had been very inexpensive, and that por- tion of his salary he had been able to lay by from time to time, amounted now to no insig- nificant sum-at least in his eyes; were he to rejoin his family, it would be sufficient to clear Rose of debt to Mr. Breton; or-if there was a prospect of that being soon accomplished without such aid-might add some branch to the business of which he could take the man- agement; or, perhaps, Mr. Breton would give him a share in his establishment; or he might be able to buy a few acres of land, and work them in connection with farmer Lee, or some one else. All these, and many kindred schemes, flitted through his mind, but were all at last re- jected. If Mr. Breton was willing to help Rose, he argued, it would be foolish in him to hinder it, when it would enable him to make another use of his means; and that was but a beggarly way of beginning farming he had just thought of. No; he would try to find some pursuit where he was, or elsewhere; but, at any rate, he would give his experiment the full test of the five years-if the next two did but equal the last, he might then turn homeward with a   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    219 proud and happy heart. Ah, that if! how little it lay in his own hands! So, failing to realize at all, as he should, that the influence his small capital would have given him in Green Hollow would be utterly wanting in a city, and that the esteem in which his mother and sisters were held by the villagers would be of no slight benefit to him, if sec- onded by his own conduct; failing, also, to see how, if he returned in his present circumstances -industrious, honest, bearing with him the proofs of his skill and worth-he would be wel- comed by all, even by those to whom he was, as yet, a stranger, as a valuable acquisition; while, if the next two, years of absence which he con- templated should prove adverse-an event not impossible, even to his hopeful gaze-and he should come back penniless, disheartened, all his early, impulsive energy gone, how could he expect to be regarded, save by his own family, but as a foolish, unsatisfied, lazy wanderer, who, not being able to content himself with a com- mon-sense life, must needs set off in quest of some fortune better than that which fell to the lot of others; and who was not, therefore, much to be pitied for his disasters by common-sense people. Failing to see all this in its true as- pect, or give it its due importance, he made his second choice; a second time he turned aside     220   ROSE CARLE'TON'S REWARD. from the secluded, but sure and safe path, to venture and to struggle in the crowded thor- oughfare. How truly had his mother spoken, when she said that even partial success might not satisfy him! and how did he afterward lament the little heed he had given to her counsel! Yet, now that his mind was decided, he almost felt-so easy is it to deceive ourselves-as if he had won a victory over himself, instead of over right; for, had not his-feelings pleaded power- fully in favor of a return? and what but a sense of what was necessary for the welfare of the family had induced him not to yield? Ah, could he but have realized that it was, indeed, a victory over his truer and better self he had gained at so much cost! It would but extend this narrative to tedious length, were I to give in detail the wandering and wearisome life Frank Carleton led for the next eighteen months; a mere outline must suf- fice, ere I hasten onward to the more important episodes of his after career. His first endeavor was to obtain a situation-similar to that he had enjoyed with Mr. Greyson; this, he had hoped, might be easily found among that gentleman's friends or acquaintances; but he soon discovered his mistake. Though no one could breathe a word of disparagement as to his character, yet   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD,    221 they nearly all refused to entertain his proposi- tion. Alas! a man who has lost his place in the scale of wealth, is not likely to find with others much favor for an humble friend; and many who expended yearly on useless luxuries twice the amount which had sufficed to main- tain the quiet comfort and elegance of Mr. Greyson's home, could now lift up hands and voices in holy horror at such a violation of re- publican principles as keeping a private tutor. "For that s what he was, my dear, I assure you-let them try to hide it as they will with that pretense of gardening. I always thought they. wanted to be aristocrats!" Nevertheless; there were some who, while in- dulging in such reflections, secretly sought to avail themselves of Frank's services, but offer- ing such poor remuneration, and throwing out such significant hints as to the sort of life they would expect him to lead, that his spirit rose up indignantly against the double deceit. So, with many a bitter sigh, did he relinquish the hope of pursuing the calling in which he delighted, and turned once again to the old refuge of at- tendance in a store. He was older now by nearly four years than when he first set out; and, with the added knowledge of the world that time had bought, might have succeeded-though the employment     222  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. was one he could not heartily lilk-had not impatience as to the result again proved his bane. Too anxious, perhaps, to secure a situa- tion worthier of his attention than those he had held formerly-and feeling, from the small means he possessed, more independent than heretofore-he rejected many offers at first, in the hope of better, which he afterward re- gretted. And this regret led him into the op- posite extreme of accepting hastily what he should have declined-falling into obscure places, where he was apt to be lost sight of in the hurried business world. Yet, in one of these obscure situations on which he chanced, it might have been his wisdom to remain; for the head of the establishment was a kind- hearted, genial, really good man, who, though not able to afford large salaries to his helpers, did them all the justice which lay in his power, and was ever ready to lend his aid when heir way opened to something better; and such a disposition in an employer is an advantage not always compensated for by pecuniary difference. But, conscious of the fleeting time-anxious to be able to show some worthy evidence of the wisdom of his course--dissatisfied with his progress, or, rather, want of progress-Frank wandered from place to place, remaining a few months in this situation, and a few months in   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    223 that; and acquiring, unknown to himself, the unenviable reputation of one too fond of chang- ing, and too easily discouraged to be -much de- pended on. But there was one fact he knew, alas! too well; which was, that the little hoard so labori- ously acquired-on whose possession he had built so much-was melting away more rapidly day by day, under the influence of his vagrant career. "Oh, that I had but returned while it was still untouched!" was his despairing excla- mation; and again he roused himself to fresh effort. "There is nothing more to be accom- plished here," he pondered;"I will try some place else;" and the next week found him in the neighboring city of D--. He sent no intelligence home of his change of residence--alas! he had long ceased the in- tercourse of letters. When he parted with Mr. Greyson he had disliked to distress then by that event without being able to add, at the same time, that he was comfortably established in a new situation; and the ill success he had met with since had strengthened his repug- nance to the duty, till month after month had passed away since he welcomed Rose's last letter; and he gave up the intention altogether ,-too much depressed by his own failure to re- flect, as he should, on the pain this neglect must     224  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. occasion to all those who loved him. But now, on his advent into new scenes, fortune seemed once more to smile upon him; and, in the glad- ness of his heart, he was almost tempted to re- sume his long-forgotten pen-how grateful, after- ward, that he had been deterred from his pur- pose! The establishment of which he now became a part, was a large and fashionable dry goods store, patronized by the elite of the city; and the readiness with which his services were ac- cepted astonished no one more than himself. It was, in fact, owing to the influence of the head clerk; but, although there was something singularly winning in Frank's general appear- ance and behavior, he did not seem to be a man apt to be easily impressed by such consid- erations; and for many months it was an un- ceasing source of astonishment to Frank, how he, lacking both means and friends to recom- mend him, had won so readily on a stranger's good graces. "At any rate," he often mused, "it proves one thing-that Rose was not quite right when'she laid so much emphasis on the likelihood of one's being overlooked or ill-treated in a large city, where one's character is not known; for here have I been trying to find some reasonable kind of employment for more than a year in the   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    225 place S have just left, and now it offers itself at once." Not many more suns had risen and set ere he acknowledged, from the depths of a bitter expe- rience, the truth of his gentle mentor's words; but years passed before he found the true clew to his sudden promotion. 15     CHAPTER XVI. "What is life, father?" "A battle, my child, Where the strongest lance may fail, Where the wariest eyes may be beguiled, And the stoutest heart may quail; Where the foes are gathered on every hand,. And rest not, day or night, And the feeble little ones must stand In the thickest of the fight." A. A. Proctor. HE had been about three months in this new situation, when, one morning, as he entered the store a little later than usual, his atten- tion was attracted  to a strange alteration in the manner of his fellow-clerks; and he noticed, with painful surprise, the mysterious, half-averted glances directed toward him as he walked up the middle of the room.  But at his old station behind the counter one welcoming face awaited him, and a fair-haired boy of fifteen summers sprang forward to meet him-his employer's (226)   iC  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     227 eldest son, who had clung to him since his first arrival with the enthusiastic friendship known only to early youth. Yet even on the sunny brightness of that face a cloud seemed resting; and after the first im- pulsive greeting, he, too, drew back and veiled his gaze with trembling hands. "For pity's sake, Alfred!" cried Frank, now shaken by vague alarm-" tell me-what does all this mean?" "Oh, do n't ask me-do n't ask me!" said the agitated boy, his bosom heaving painfully. "But what have I done," queried Frank, "that you should all act thus?" "Dear Frank!" exclaimed the other, clinging to his arm, "you will know it soon enough. But no matter what any one-even father-says, I do n't-I can't-I won't believe it I. Oh, who can have told such a dreadful lie!" "Alfred," said Frank, with tender earnestness, "I feel sure you would not readily believe aught against me; but others will, dear; and I could be better prepared to clear myself if I knew beforehand what it was; won't you help me?" "There is no time now," replied his friend, in  a hurried tone, and turning pale, "for I see the office-boy coming this way, and. I know father has sent him for you." "Mr. Howard would like Mr. Carleton to     228   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. come to his room for a moment," interrupted the messenger, who had now joined them. "Tell him I will be there immediately," said Frank, rising. "I will go with you," cried Alfred, rising, too; "maybe father will listen to me;" and in a few minutes they reached the office door. Mr. Howard opened it with his usual polite- ness, but started in grave surprise when his son confronted him. "Alfred," he said, firmly, yet not unkindly, "I have told you that you could not be present at this interview; I tell you so now. Mr. Carle- ton, will you please to come in?" And Alfred saw the door close behind his friend, while he remained outside, gazing va- cantly at the panels, as if they had power to reveal the events transpiring within; then wak- ened to an agony of hope and fear as to the result of the conference. There were two persons in the room which Frank entered besides Mr. Howard-his part- ner, and Mr. James, the head clerk. A porten- tious silence and gravity marked all three, and for a short time after Frank had taken his seat nothing was said. Mr. Howard was the first to speak. "You are aware, Carleton, no doubt, of the reason for this meeting?" were his first words.   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    229 "No, sir," he replied, in a voice whose fearless, ringing melody no guilty breast could have counterfeited. It had its effect on his ques- tioner, for, raising his eyes to the honest young face before him, he faltered a moment in his speech; then went on: "I am, then, under the painful necessity of informing you; and as there is no use in delay, I may as well say at once, that-that-the fact is, Carleton, grieved as I am to tell it, that the firm has lost lately, at various times, consider- able sums of money, and suspicion rests on you." Frank was confounded-he to be charged with such a crime! to see in the faces of his accusers that they already condemned him! "It is false!" he cried, indignantly, looking round the room; "what motive has given rise to such a slander, I can not imagine; but I am a stranger here-alone-far from friends and relatives; it were easy for an enemy, had I one, to undo me!" "Proof will do more toward clearing your character than passion," said the other partner, eyeing him with a cold distrust. "And I am sorry to say it is no enemy, as you seem to sup- pose, who has brought this charge against you, but one who has always proved your friend," and he looked toward Mr. James.     230   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Frank started in amazement; here, at least, had he looked for support and encouragement -and to be deserted and defamed thus! He remained silent and distracted, scarce able to believe the evidence of his senses. But his whilom friend's first words soon undeceived him. "I am exceedingly grieved to be compelled to take part in this painful affair," he said, not looking at Frank, but addressing himself to all in the room; "anol it was not until the proofs became so numerous and so strong that I could not, in justice to the duties of my position, slight them, that I interfered. I am sure, if Mr. Carleton can establish his innocence, no one will be more rejoiced than I.". "You see, Frank," Mr. Howard interrupted, forgetting for the moment forms of state, and really pitying his distress, "the thing lies in your own hands. We do not wish to call in the aid of the law; but we must have a full and free investigation of your affairs. My partner here has been making inquiries about your mode of life before coming to us, ana it is only fair to say that the accounts he has received are not such as to inspire confidence; so many changes, in so short a time, from one situation to another, suggest grave doubts-at least, in the light of recent disclosures. Nevertheless, if your integ-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    231 rity comes forth from this ordeal untarnished, they might be accounted for on the score of youthful imprudence." "Mr., Howard," said Frank, recovering his speech, "what you ask is but just, and I gladly accede to it; but I think I have the right, first, to hear some of the proofs against me." "Certainly," was the answer. "James, you know them best; so please satisfy him." The clerk began; it was a long and cunningly devised tale, which I need scarcely recount here. It was his custom to sleep in a little room off the store, he said; and one night, soon after the first sum was missed, being unusually wake- ful, thinking of it, he heard a sound, like the opening of a shutter, and saw a man, bearing a close resemblance to Frank, entering the office through a small back window, carelessly left unbarred. He had a key in his hand, and was proceeding toward the safe, when Mr. James, letting a heavy parcel fall, frightened him, and he crept away. Another time he permitted the robbery to be accomplished, that he might have a better view of the person, and almost certainly recognized him. These and similar experiences made up the burden of his speech. The two partners looked at Frank, as if to ask what reply he. could make to such over- whelming testimony. Dumb with astonish-     232  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. ment, his looks answered them in turn. At last he said: "If Mr. James has really seen all this-" "We have the utmost confidence in Mr. James," interrupted his employer, gravely; and Frank saw he had not bettered his cause by implying such a doubt; nevertheless, he went on without amending it: "All I can say is, that his eyesight has de- ceived him strangely. But I am willing to submit to any test. Begin the investigation when you will. Yet, Mr. Howard," he turned to him, as more impartial than the others, "you know how simply I live; that I do not indulge in any dissipation. Does it stand to reason that I would be likely to commit such a crime?" For a moment Mr. Howard'wavered, but his partner came to his support. "It is all very well to talk of dissipation," he said, with that steady distrust which fired Frank more than any accusation; " but there are other motives to dishonesty quite as strong. No one here is a stranger to your desire for saving, that you may establish yourself in life. How natural for one lacking principle to grow weary of the slow gains of legitimate toil, and seek to enrich himself by other and easier methods!" That the pure ambition of his life should be   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    233 the base on which to rear so foul a suspicion! that his rash impatience to attain the goal should justify it! Oh, fond mother, and loving sister! in all your dreams, so full of fears for your dear one, you never dreamed of aught like this! A faint'exclamation of horror and surprise rose to Frank's lips, but was instantly checked, as he marked the look of quiet scorn on the face before him. "Enough of this!" said his stern accuser. "We must get to business." "Except the small sum you have deposited with us," interposed Mr. Howard, "I am aware, Carleton-for we have- taken the trouble to make inquiry-that you have none with any other house, here or elsewhere; the only thing that remains, therefore, is to examine your per- sonal effects. Believe me, for my own part, it is not so much the recovery of a few hundred dol- lars, as to be assured of the dependence we can place on those in our employ, for which I am anxious; and I would be most happy to see you cleared." Frank was about to thank him, when the other partner interrupted.  "We must request Mr. Carleton to be so kind as to accompany us to his lodgings," he said; "that is the fittest place for his speech." "Now?" asked Frank, with proud innocence,     234  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. though a strange and secret misgiving filled his soul. "Yes," was the cold reply; "the sooner the better." And, rising, they all left the room. The investigation of Frank's possessions and abode had been undertaken at the suggestion of Mr. James, who argued that, while it might not lead to the recovery of the money-" for he had doubtless disposed of that"-they would, perhaps, discover some evidence of the robbery. Every nook and corner, it seemed to Frank, had been searched again and again, yet nothing had been brought to light to justify the suspicions cast upon him; the unaccountable misgiving which had at first seized upon his mind was fast yielding place to a proud confidence in the strength of his innocence to defend him; and he almost smiled, painful though the moment was, at the insignificenf display his poor posses- sions, now spread before him, made. But he was not destined to pass through this ordeal unscathed. Mr. Howard had professed himself satisfied with the search, and turned to congrat- ulate Frank, when his partner noticed a small box on the mantel shelf, hitherto overlooked. "Spare your joy," he said, "until we have examined this. Ah, it is locked!" he added, rudely shaking it. "Mr. Carleton, I must trouble you for the key."   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    235 Frank gave it, with a flushed face and quiv- ering lip. Were his most sacred treasures, then, to be thus lightly trifled with? For that small, square cedar box held all his cherished memen- toes of home-the letters from his mother and Rose. He looked on, scarce able to restrain himself, as the lid was thrown back, and those  sweet messages that had so often soothed his heart were desecrated by a stranger's scrutiny. But no other thought entered his mind, until a sharp exclamation of sorrow and surprise fell from Mr. Howard's lips; and, pressing forward, he saw what had transfixed the gaze of his com- panions. The box was emptied of its contents, and, lying at the bottom-strange sight for his eyes!-were the mold of wax, the metal, the key-sad instruments of crime, that flashed con- viction of his guilt on the minds of those re- garding him. Mr. Howard looked distressed, for he had had, from the outset, a large share of his son's faith in Frank's integrity. His partner was sternly satisfied to have the mys- tery settled at last; and Mr. James was full of polite concern. But Frank stood, heedless of them all, his gaze fixed on the terrible evidence of guilt before him; despairing, incredulous, unable to say a word in his own defense. "You see," said his partner to Mr. Howard,     236  . ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. holding up the safe key, "this is the exact coun- terpart of the one found in that box. I think the testimony is complete." "I am  afraid so," he reluctantly replied. "Carleton, have you any thing to say?" What can I say, sir," answered Frank's low voice, " that will alter your thought of me, now? There is some mistake or villainy here. Heaven is witness that I am innocent! But I have no friend to support me. Oh, if only-"For one swift instant, he thought of Mr. Greyson; alas! he was far away-then went on: "I can only deny that these things ever were in my posses- sion-that I ever saw them till to-day. But what are these words against the seeming evi- dence before you?-nothing! nothing!" He covered his face with his clasped hands, and sank into a chair. The others retired a little space, to consult on what remained to be done. As they still found no clue to the whereabouts of the missing money, Mr. Howard's partner, who cared much more for recovering it than he did, proposed that they should obtain from Frank the name of his-fam- ily's residence, that they might make inquiry of some trustworthy person there, as to whether they were known to have received any consider- able remittance lately. But Frank's agonized entreaties that his mother and sisters should not   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    237 be informed of what had passed, touched Mr. Howard's compassionate heart, and he peremp- torily refused to sanction the proceeding, though Frank's emotion tended to strengthen rather than diminish the conviction of his guilt. His part- ner reluctantly conceded this point, but insisted that the sum Frank had placed in their care should at least help to make up their loss; and Frank proudly assenting, Mr. Howard also agreed, and the painful scene was over. "You will know me better, some day," said Frank, as Mr. Howard bid him good-by; " and then the foul wrong that has been done me will be clear." "God grant it, if you are innocent!" he re- plied; "and, if not, oh, retrace your steps ere it is too late!" Alone in the world again-oh, infinitely worse than alone! for thief was branded on the hon- ored name his forefathers had borne! Why should he care for longer life? why should he seek his home again? Naught could his pres- ence bring now but grief and shame. So mused the outcast, through the long hours of that dreary evening. It was late at night when a letter was brought to him, containing fifty dollars, "From a friend." Ah, he knew it could be none other than Alfred, and pressed the missive to his burning lips with     238  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. grateful love. Here, at least, were the means for leaving the scenes where to sojourn now was torture; and the next morning found him again a wanderer.   CHAPTER XVII. The voices of my home!-I hear them still! They have been with me through the dreamy night- The blessed household voices, wont to fill My heart's clear depths with unalloyed delight! I hear them still unchanged; though some from earth Are music parted, and the tones of mirth- Wild, silvery tones) that rang through days more bright! Have died in others-yet to me they come, Singing of boyhood back-the voices of my home! Mrs. Hemans. T was a cold, dark evening in Febru- ary, and the streets of the little town of M  -  , in the State of Ohio, were silent and  deserted.  One  traveler, only, pursued his weary way over the shnow-clad pavement; the wintry blast pierced his thin garments, his step was slow  and unsteady, and   his eyes dejectedly sought the ground. 'Now, the light streaming from a window near, falls across his face; but' in those haggard, pain-marked lineaments few (239)     240   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. would recognize the handsome, eager youth who so hopefully bade his sister adieu on that summer morning, nearly five years ago. Yes, it is, in- deed, Frank Carleton-how altered, how mis- erable, he alone can tell!-whose aimless wan- derings have led him hither. But though the night is drawing on, and gloomier shadows wrap the earth, and the wind rises in fitful, sobbing gusts, betokening a storm, he seeks no shelter within the confines of the town; but, as one cast out from the sympathy and help of his fellow-men, he passes by their habitations, and wanders out on the broad coun- try road, wild and desolate under that bleak sky, heedless whither it shall lead him. A mile and more those weary feet have trod- den, and the glimmer of light from the town has long since faded from .his track, when, drawing near an humble cottage by the wayside, his fail- ing limbs refuse to bear him further; and, steal- ing noiselessly through the gateway, he lies down within the shelter of the porch.. Though nothing, save a glass of water, has moistened those parched lips since morning, he cares not, in the apathy of utter weariness, to ask for food, while some remnant of the old pride still rises at the thought of alms. If he may but rest here, unnoticed by the inmates, till the gray dawn breaks upon the east, his desires will be satisfied; then to steal   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    241 away again, through the snow and mist, and wander on, till death shall end a life so useless and so blighted, is all his wish. But so wills not that merciful Providence which still, all forsaken though he seems, has him in its keeping. For, when the morning light glances coldly on the Snow, and the good- man of the house goes forth to care for his cattle, his, startled eye falls on the famine- stricken form still resting 'neath the shadow of the porch, the snow-drifts all his covering. Resting! Oh, too much akin to that last, un- ending rest, seemed the marble pallor and cold- ness of that brow, the lips apart, the half-veiled eyes, the still hands folded on the breast! To no unfeeling heart did they appeal, coarse and rough though its exterior was; and, bending down, those brawny hands sought tenderly as a woman's for some sign of animation, and the faint flutter of the heart that answered to his touch thrilled him with a pure, unselfish joy. Nor was woman's aid long wanting; for, rising quickly at that sign of hope, he opened the door and called, in tones that rang from kitchen to attic of the little dwelling: "Judy! Judy!" She was not long in obeying the summons, nor slow in comprehending the dilemma. And now, while she stands consulting with her hus- I6     242.  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. band beside that prostrate form, let me attempt to describe her to the reader, for in her he or she may, perhaps, recall an old acquaintance. Her strong accent would at once, to one at all familiar with it, betray her nationality. But she boasts naught of the beauty that ofttimes graces Ireland's fair daughters, even in a rank as lowly as hers. Her hair, though abundant, is of too unmistakable a tint for even a poet's license to transform into auburn, and the features of her face are coarse and prominent. Yet, notwith- standing, it is a countenance by no means un- inviting, but eloquent with those simple, kindly virtues that make up the chief happiness of life, and children would instinctively turn to it for comfort and protection. The kind blue eyes, the fresh complexion, the sweet good humor of the mouth, between whose red lips glance, ever and anon, rows of glistening pearl, are a pleasant picture to gaze upon; and the time has been when to Frank and Rose it seemed the only friendly face among a motley crowd; for she is none other than the poor wo- man whose endless gratitude Rose had won by ministering to her little boy during his illness, on their voyage to America, and whose sympa- thy and thanks Rose herself had ever lovingly remembered. / But it is not until the stranger, whom they   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    243 have found half lifeless at their door, has been carried into the humble dwelling, and laid upon their own bed, that she recognizes him; for, as her gentle hands disrobe him, she discovers, concealed in an innermost pocket, Mr. Grey- son's precious- gift-reminder of a happy life, still cherished through all blight and grief!- and her quick eyes notice, as she glances at it before laying it aside, these words, on the casing of the watch, which she reads aloud to her hus- band, who is ignorant of that accomplishment: "To Francis Carleton-April 20, I8-. From his grateful friends, L. and M. Greyson." "Sure, Pat!" she cried, in a delirium of grief and joy, to her husband, who was still striving to restore the sufferer to consciousness, "he must be the brother of me blessed Miss Rose- and no one else! Och, an' I wondher," gazing at him closer, " that my blind eyes did n't know him sooner! Though it's changed you are, acushla! from the handsome gossoon I first saw you! He is coming to, now, Pat, dear- the Saints be praised that sent him to our door!" She caught the thin hand between her own, and covered it with tears and kisses; but in the burning eyes that rested for a moment on her face, and then roved anxiously about the room, there shone no gleam of recognition or of reason.     244   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Oh, famine and despair had done their work well! and fierce and cruel was the battle in which that young life strove for victory-long and weary were the days and nights before the contest ended! I would some pen, more eloquent than that which my poor fingers hold, could picture the pure, unselfish, untiring devotion of the sufferer's humble nurse. No hope of future reward or gain--no thought of it, even entered her breast; but, as she hovered round his bed, and cooled his fevered brow-or sought to entice him to the little nourishment he would consent to take-or hushed the noisy clamor of the blooming group who called her mother, when the snowy lids drooped drowsily over the dark eyes-the only prompter of her loving zeal was grateful memory of the past. Yet the service was not great which had been rendered her; such had not been in Rose's power; ah, it- was the sweet and unaffected recognition of a oneness in the sorrows of humanity which touched her heart so deeply. And dearer, sadder, and more sacred mem- ories clustered around the recollection of that voyage now; for the child, whose illness Rose had helped to soothe, had long since passed from his mother's yearning arms to the Beyond; and, as she watched the pallid face before her,   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     245 so strangely pathetic in its wan youth and beauty, the ready tears would overflow her eyes, and an earnest prayer rise to her lips, lest he, , too, should be hastening thither. Not forget- ful to entertain strangers, the hope of shelter- ing unawares a holier visitant had now, indeed, to her simple faith, met its fulfillment-for, was not one dear, as she knew he must be, to the gentle girl she thought of so tenderly, an angel unto her? Still raged the fever, fiercer and more fiercely, in his throbbing veins, until there came, a day when-though all unwitting of medical terms- she felt instinctively the crisis had arrived. But the deep, calm slumber which had fallen on him gave her hope; and, as the cloudy March even- ing deepened into night, she called her children round the bed, and through the long hours of darkness their prayers ascended that the hope might reach fruition. Oh, believe me! this is no mere adornment of fiction, but a fact of real life.' And who shall say, though the petition was, doubtless, misdi- rected, and appealed to the creature rather than to the Creator, that it found no acceptance with Him who judgeth "according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not?" For, when the first, faint, rosy streak of dawn kindled in the east, and Frank's eyes     246  ROSE CARLETON'S BREWARD. unveiled from that deep slumber-while a soft sigh, like that of a weary but happy child, who wakens from some long distress, broke the si- lence-the pale face was lighted up with the glory which Reason alone can give! Blush! you who own a' simpler faith and wor- ship at a purer shrine. Blush! for the death- less gratitude-the true devotion-the unfalter- ing trust in Heaven-shown by one whom you too often despise as a worshiper of images and strange gods! Oh, if you would win those whom you thus condemn to a clearer light, you must, indeed, with more than equal earnestness, show forth your faith by your works! The soft May breezes gently lifted the curling locks of hair upon Frank's forehead, and fanned the cheeks that were once more growing round and ruddy, as he rested on the porch before the door of his entertainers' dwelling. He had long since told them his history, and they, in turn, had related theirs; how, by a course of patient industry, they were at last able to rent this little farm, and live on it in a state of comfort they would once have never dreamed of; and were not now without the hope that, at no very dis- tant day, they might become its proud posses- sors. Painful as such a contrast to his own   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    247 career must have been to Frank, he rejoiced none the less heartily in their prosperity; and, in truth, his chastened spirit now confessed, as well as deplored, his errors of rashness and im- patience, and sought but to be guided in the right way-nor was that way hidden from his gaze. "And so, Mrs. Kennedy," he said, gayly, though the tears dimmed his eyes, to his kind hostess, who sat near him on the shady porch, busily sewing, while the youngest children romped on the grass beyond, "you won't let me off from my promise to go home, and not try my fortune any more?" "Ah, then, Masther Frank; it's jokin' you must be, to think of such a thing as wantin' to get off! Only, you won't lave us too soon?" "Well, what a woman you are!" cried Frank, laughing. "So anxious for me to go-and yet I can't speak of it without your telling me it mustn't be too soon! But it must be very soon now, my dear, dear nurse," he added, tak- ing her hand, and pressing it to his lips; "for this is nearly the last of May; and it was the tenth of June when I left home; and if-if"- his voice shook- "they are all well, I would dearly like to rejoin them on that day. So pre- pare to lose me next week." "You know I would nW cross you, mavour- ,      248   ROSE CARLET'O'S REWARD. neen," she replied; "and sure it will make you quite sthrong and well to see Miss Rose and the misthress again-and Kate and Nora, too- the darlin's! well do I remember them!" "They will remember you, too," said Frank; "for how often we all used to talk of you! My poor mother-she will never be able to bless or thank you enough for your kindness to her vag- abond son! Oh, Mrs. Kennedy! if she or my sweet sister should not be there to meet me, how could I bear-the bitter remorse-I--" he broke off suddenly, his voice choked by stifled sobs. "Hush, Masther Frank!" she whispered, gently, but gravely-her hand upon his arm. "Have you no trust in God? He has n't kept you till this, asthore, to send you grief at last! Only don't forget to thank Him, my darlin'- and do n't forget the lesson when the bitterness is past." "Heaven helping me, I will not "Frank answered, solemnly. "And oh, dear friend, I do, indeed, believe-though this terrible dread will master me sometimes-that the end will be joy! How happy we will be next summer, when we all meet again-for you know you have promised to come and make a long, long visit. And then, Kathleen "-to the child who was climbing on his knee-"you shall see my   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    249 Kate, and Nora, too. Somehow," he added, turning to her mother, "I always think of them as children; though they must be grown and altered greatly in all these years. What a sweet little darling Nora was when I went away -ah, I can hardly hope that she will remember me!'" "No fear of that, Masther Frank-an' you their own an' only brother;! Dear, good childer they were, both; but it's 'Miss Rose I long for news of most. Sure, you won't forget to write us all about her, and the misthress?" "Oh, no," said Frank; "how could I? And Rose will send you a letter herself. Does n't that reconcile you to my going next week?" "Ah, it's sore to part with you, acushla! but sure, I would n't stay you-an' your poor heart achin' so for home. The Blessed Virgin an' all the Saints have yaou in their keepin'!"And then her mother's arms were round his neck- her loving, honest tears and kisses on his: brow. Early one lovely morning, a few days after this conversation, Frank was speeding cheerily, in Mr. Kennedy's little wagon, toward the next town; where he was to take the stage for home; while his host's rosy children still clustered round the gate-gazing down the road, as' if unable- to believe that the gentleman who had '     250  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. played with them so often, and told them so many delightful stories, could, indeed, be gone; and their mother, in the shadow of the porch, wept from a full heart tears of mingled grief and joy-and waited anxiously to learn the journey's end.   CHAPITER XVIII. Still hath thy mother's eye, Thy coming step to greet, A look of days gone by, Tender and gravely sweet. Still when the prayer is said, For thee kind bosoms yearn, For thee kind tears are shed- Oh'! when wilt thou return! Mrs. Hemans. HE sun had never risen with more dazzling radiance over the stirring little town of Green Hollow than on that June morning of which I write; and scarcely, in the unceasing circuit of the globe, had his bright eye ,AGZ   glanced on a fairer picture than that of Rose Carleton as she sat, in her simple morning dress-the sun-rays flecking her smooth brown hair with gold, and the pure serenity of a soul at peace with God beaming in her gentle eyes-sorting the letters which last (251)     252   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. night's mail had brought, in her mother's little sitting-room that opened off the shop. A light tap sounded on the door, and Mrs. Breton entered. "Do n't interrupt your work, my dear," she said, smiling, as Rose sprang up to welcome her; "I only dropped in for a little chat; and we can have that, and work, too-can't we?" So saying, she sat down in a rocking-chair by the open window-Rose's face half turned to- ward her-and prepared to unfold her budget of news. "Did you know that Mrs. Lee is expecting her daughter some time this month? She will make quite a long visit." "No," answered Rose, pleased and interested; "we have not seen any of them for more than a week. How delighted Mrs. Lee will be! Does her daughter resemble her? You know I never saw her." "Yes, I remember; she was married just be- fore you came to Green Hollow. She looked very like her mother then. Every one was sorry when she went away." "She will have a warm welcome back," said Rose, and sighed softly, thinking of one they could scarcely hope to welcome more. "She will, indeed!" assented Mrs. Breton. "And that reminds me that we are to have a   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    253 very different guest, this summer. You know, my brother has invited our eldest son to spend a few months at his farm-of course, he will go -and Mr. Breton has engaged a boy in his stead, to assist him in the store. I am afraid we won't have much pleasure in his company; I am out of humor with him already. Dear me, how pleasant it was when your poor brother was with us! or you,.yourself, for that was better still!" She ceased suddenly and looked up-struck by the stillness that had fallen on the room. The busy hands had ceased fluttering among the letters; and from the face, half turned to- ward her, so blooming but a minute ago, every vestige of color had retreated, while the clear blue eyes gazed, with a strange and half-affrighted glance, on the missive which lay before her. "Rose, dearest!" she exclaimed, rising quickly and crossing the floor to her side, "speak to me; what is the matter?" The trembling hand motioned toward the let- ter. Mrs. Breton took it up. "Her brother's writing, surely!" she cried, half under her breath; then knelt down by Rose's side. "Listen to me, dear " she said; "this letter is certainly from Frank; so he must be living, and, let us hope, well. Oh, Rose, for his sake -for your mother's-try and be more calm."     254  ROSE CARLETONAS REWARD. Ah, at that word, how flow ed the blessed tears, healing the fevered brain! Her mother! Could there, then, indeed, be hope that the heavy Weight of grief upon that cherished heart was to be removed? She threw her arms round Mrs. Breton's neck, and thanked and kissed her. "We must know the best or worst before we tell mamma," she said, taking the letter from her friend's hand, and hastily breaking the seal. Cease, heart, thy anguished throbbings! No failing hand has traced those perfect characters! And is not that the well-beloved name which ends the sheet? The message which they devoured-no other word can express it-so eagerly, ran thus: "SWEET SISTER:-Forgive me for the long silence that must have grieved so deeply your loving heart. I know, now, how wrong and proud in me it was. But, in returning home, I would fain hope to return, also, to an humbler and truer life. And though no success has crowned my wanderings-how  could I have hoped for it, in the impatient spirit with which I set forth!-I will not wrong the love so fond and tried by a shadow of doubt on my welcome back. Our mother, Rose-our mother, so dear and precious!-break this knowledge to her gen- tly. I write to you, instead of her, that you may   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    255 prepare her. Oh, how I pray Heaven to give us to each other again! You remember the day we parted-its anniversary is not far dis- tant-then, then, beloved mother, dearest sisters! your. most unworthy but loving and repentant Frank hopes for a meeting that will fear no earthly parting." Rose pressed the paper to her lips, and raised her sweet face, sparkling through its tears, to Mrs. Breton. "How shall we tell mamma?" she said. "She is not strong; the shock might be too great. How can we prepare her?" "There is no need," said a low voice, near; and Mrs. Carleton, who had noiselessly entered the room a few moments before, was at her side. Rose sprang up and caught her in her arms. "Oh, my daughter, my daughter! Praise God for this!. Your faith was stronger and truer than *  amine-has He not rewarded it?" They were alone now, for Mrs. Breton had silently withdrawn; and, with one accord, they sank upon their knees in such an ecstasy of joy and thanks that it was almost agony. Few words were spoken; but the flowing tears, the raised hands, the face transfigured with the light of happiness, told the heart's deep grati- tude, too great for utterance.     256   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. Then Kate's light footstep sounded in the hall, for it was near the hour of noon, and her morning school was over; and she and Nora came in to learn the gladsome tidings; and, for a time, every more sublunary thing was forgot- ten in the wonderful event. Oh, royal June sunshine, streaming through the room! a feeble type art thou of the heaven of life and love within their happy breasts! "There is one denial, Rose, dear, that I must ask you to practice," said Mrs. Carleton, when, in the evening, they were all more composed, and better able to converse. "What is that, mamma?" "It will be a little hard, I know, dear; but I think it is for the best. Do n't tell Frank, for awhile at least, after his return, of the surprise we have in store for him." "But why, mamma?" "I would like, Rose, to see how he will shape his course, independent of that knowledge. It would make my heart more satisfied about his future; and I am sure that he himself would feel happier and more contented, afterward, to have the opportunity of showing us the strength of his determination. Will you promise, love?" "Surely, mamma," was Rose's ready answer. "But you will not make the trial long?" "No, it shall be as short as possible; and not   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    257 without its reward, Rose, for then the success of our efforts will be complete. You know there is one more payment yet due, which this little interval will enable us to meet. Are you satis- fied?" "Oh, yes, dear mamma! it is far better as you say." "Io you know that this is the sixth of June?" interrupted Kate. "So there are only four days-" "Till Frank's return," added Rose. "Oh, how I wish they were over!" They were not long in passing, and, at last, the wished-for morning broke. The little house- hold was stirring almost before dawn. But their vigilance was not needed, for the early stage ar- rived, and brought no Frank'; and the day passed on, and the evening deepened into night, and still-they waited in vain to hear the shrill blast of the horn,. betokening the laggard traveler's approach. They were all assembled in the cozy little sitting-room, made bright this evening by all the contrivances affection could suggest to wel- come his return. The tea-table was set forth in tempting array; the candles were lighted; fresh flowers adorned the mantel-shelf; and through the open window came, softly sighing, the sum- mer breeze. But the little group sat sad and 17     258  ROSE CARLE'ON'S REWARD. silent, Rose clasping her mother's hand, and striving to control her tears, for the disappoint- ment grieved her sorely. "There is no use waiting any longer, mamma," said Kate, at last. "Something must have oc- curred to detain the stage; it will hardly come to-night." "Hush-hush!" cried Rose, pale with excite- ment. "I hear some one coming up the walk- I know his step!" His step it was-firmer and more manly than of yore; for, as she flew with eager, trembling haste to open the door, her brother met her on the threshold, and clasped her to his heart! A moment only did they linger, for there stood one most dearly cherished, the pallor of whose cheek, the tremor of whose lip, told that the mortal frame could ill sustain tlh rapture of this meeting. Surely, to her should belong its first moments! and Rose relinquished his encircling arm, to give her mother place. Ah, to feel her child's warm kisses on her lips once more, to read in the open, ingenuous, manly face, that the trial of the absent years had changed in naught his love and reverence for her and home, for all that is truthful and holy- what more could Heaven bestow? "Mother-my mother!" was all that he could say.   ROSE CARLE'ON'S REWARD.    259 She did not answer; but closer, closer to her fond, true heart pressed her recovered treasure. Forgiveness-love- unshaken trust in his loyalty to honor-no word, most elo- quently uttered, could have told it half so well as that embrace, "But I must not be too selfish," said Mrs. Carleton, at length, smiling through her tears, and, with gentle force, putting him from her clinging arms. "Here are Kate and Nora waiting for their turn." What a sweet tumult of happiness it was that followed! Of joyous sobbing, of tearful laugh- ter, of questions that waited not for answer, of answers scarcely heard for the beating of their hearts! Enough, that he was with them-all their own again! Kate stole out, after awhile, for the tea; but repeating her invitation to it twenty different times in vain, she was almost giving up the effort in despair, when they at last consented to listen. I fear there was but scanty justice. done to the repast that night, though Frank could never admire enough the, dainty aspect of the table, or the dear home look of every thing around him. But they could not keep their eyes from seeking his face, to assure themselves of his actual presence; and he was noting the changes Time had wrought since his departure.     260  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. In his mother there were few; yet the silver lines threading the. glossy hair, the pensive mouth and eyes which had caught an added sadness, smote all unwittingly upon his heart. Rose was the same gentle, affectionate girl as ever; more quiet, perhaps, but that was all. But the little sisters-whose fresh, childish loveliness and winning ways had dwelt so often in his thought-where were they? He glanced at Nora, whose blue eyes were regarding him, half shyly, from beneath their long lashes, and said to himself that he had lost them. The image of what she had been, on the morning of his departure, rose up before him-" the sweetest little maid that ever crowed for kisses"-was she, indeed, beyond recall? No; gazing closer, he could discern that the olden likeness had been merged, not lost, in the new; and that the heritage of love to which he returned was richer than that he had left. But the hours had sped faster than they had been aware, and Frank must leave the full re- cital of his story to the morrow. The broken thanksgiving to Heaven that overflowed from the mother's full heart, as she gathered her little flock-none missing-around her once again, it were sacrilege to repeat; but each felt, as they rose to separate for the night, a soothed and chastened joy, as if the spirit of   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    261 him who was once their earthly guardian had blessed this glad reunion. No wonder that Frank marveled, as he sank to sleep that night, under the sweet security of the home roof, his mother's loving kisses still clinging to his lips, that any ambitious or im- patient mood had tempted him away. ,t     CHAPTER XIX.

HE next day was a busy one, and all too short for their requirements; for p Frank had to tell his story all over, from the beginning; and Rose must write to Mrs. Kennedy; and there were all the little alterations and im- provements in house and garden to be shown -- and Rose's shop -and Kate's school. There seemed no end to the wonders claiming Frank's attention.  And it was no small proof of the worth of his charac- ter, the ready appreciation he had for the suc- cessful labors of another, when his own had so signally failed. It was still morning when old friends and neighbors came thronging in with welcome and (262)   ROSE OARLETON'S REWARD.   263   congratulation-the Lees and Bretons foremost of the train. Nor these alone, for the whole town sympathized in the joy of the family they held in such high esteem; if Frank had re- turned a millionaire, I doubt if his welcome had been so universal-it could not have been half so sincere. Nor were they merely empty pro- fessions of regard; Frank had no need to seek for work, when offers of employment pressed upon him from every side; humble offers, to be sure, but not the less showing the hearty good- will which prompted them; and, casting aside his old, vain dreams, he gladly seized the advan- tage. Not that he would ever sink to the level of a mere drudge-he still cherished the hope of future independence--but his clearer vision now discerned it as the work of a life-time rather than of a day; and saw that he could be as truly enfranchised in spirit in the effort as in the attainment. "I owe this to you, dear Rose," he said, ten- derly. " If it had not been for your persevering industry, how different would my'lot be now!" She shook her head, smiling. "I had greater advantages, dear brother. Mamma's encourage- ment-her help and Kate's; while you-so far from any friends-what had you not to struggle with ?" "That only brings the fault nearer home," he    264  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. answered. "What right had I to be so far away?-but that my cowardly, impatient spirit (for it was moral cowardice, Rose-the worst of all!) could not look with your steadfast eyes at the hardships of the way, so weakly fled-it knew not whither-and left the burden all to these dear hands." He kissed them as he spoke. Her deprecating glance met his. "Well, well, dear sister," he replied to it, "we will talk of this no more. I would show my penitence in. future more by deed than word." He did so; as the months sped on, Mrs. Carle- ton marked, with increasing thankfulness, how the old, impulsive, eager energy had given place to a steadfast earnestness in the pursuits of life, which well befitted the Christian gentleman; and how, while he fulfilled the every-day duties with a cheerful contentedness very different from the wild, enthusiastic visions of yore when entering on a new path, the old delight in the simple enjoyments of home-an evening walk, reading, or conversation-revived and strength- ened day by day. Rose had waited patiently for the end of the probation her mother had imposed; and the time had passed so pleasantly and quickly after' Frank's return, that she could scarcely realize the flight of so many months, when, on an Oc-   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    265  tober morning, Mrs. Carleton declared herself altogether satisfied, and gave the long-coveted permission to reveal their cherished secret. "Can you take a holiday to-morrow, brother?" Rose asked, that day, at the dinner-table. "You know it is my birthday. Nora will watch the store; and it would be so nice to spend it in the woods, as we used to do when we were chil- dren." "Yes, surely!" answered Frank. "I am cer- tain I have only to ask my employer, to get it. And this lovely autumn weather must n't pass without our having some enjoyment of it. Won't you come, too, mother?"  "Not now," she said, smiling-" another time." For it was her wish that Rose's lips alone should tell the tale. So, in the freshness of the early morning, they set out-happy as two children just re-s leased from school. Mrs. Carleton stood in the doorway, watching their retreating figures, and thought of that-how different!-morning when -homeless orphans-they had gone in quest of their first poor shelter. "Dear children!" she murmured, her eyes dewy; "God has prospered them; may He bless them in the future as in the past!" "We will rest here for .a little while," said Frank, as, after a pleasant 4aunter of an hour,     266   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. they reached a grassy knoll, at whose foot ran the clear waters of the mountain brook. "You look pale, dear sister-we have walked too far." Rose sat down in the place which he prepared for her, as if she scarce had heard him; and, noticing her thoughtful mood, he, too, remained silent for some moments. "Do you remember, Frank," she said, at last, in a quiet tone of reverie, though the small- hands folded on her lap trembled'a little as she spoke-" do you remember our first day in Green Hollow? And how, when we had found the house we live in now, you said: 'Ah, Rose! if we but owned this little place, how pretty we could make it!" "I do, indeed, Rose! And but for my folly, your hopeful prophecy that day might have been fulfilled on this. Oh, how truly did your brave spirit put mine to shame!" "Dear brother, you have made us all amends. Do not reproach yourself any more." She was silent for awhile; then continued: "It has been a sweet little home to all of us, Frank; we love it dearly-do we not?" "It is dearer to me now than ever, Rose, darling." "To all of us, Frarik, how greatly dearer! Still, were we, even yet, striving to work out a home of our own, it is not this-beloved as it   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    267 is-that we should choose. We would still cling to the old dream of a country life-would we not, dearest brother?" She spoke in a tone half serious, half playful -her hands clasped upon his shoulder; but had he bent to gaze within the downcast eyes, he must have, seen the tear-drops trembling in their depths. "Ah, Rose, you know my old longing has never changed; and, maybe, sometime in the future, it will be accomplished. Very far in the, future, now, I fear; for property must have greatly increased in value-Green Hollow is so much enlarged since I left it." "In the town itself," said Rose, "farms have not risen in proportion." "No, not yet ; but they will soon-before we can hope to profit by the delay. But I will not be impatient or unhappy about it any more, when you all so lovingly forget the past. Oh, how slow I was to learn the lesson that it is not the fu- ture but the present with which we have to do; What a pretty spot this is!" he added, cheer- fully, turning the conversation. "That woodland sheltering it to the jnorth; far off, the river to the west; and this green, open, sunny slope to east and south-that little brook half circling it, like a silver cord. I wonder no one has chosen this as the spot on which to rear their home-     268  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. stead; for surely there could not be one more beautiful in all the country round." "You really think so?" said Rose, the agita- tion in her voice no longer to be constrained. "I do, indeed. But why are you thus so ear- nest?" "Oh, Frank!" she cried, bursting into happy tears, and hiding her face upon his shoulder; "dearest brother!-it is ours-it is yours!" "Ours-yours!" he repeated, in a tone of astonishment. "You are dreaming, Rose!" "No dream-thank God! but the blessed truth!" she replied, raising her wet face from its resting-place. "Oh, Frank, did you think that in our labors all these years, we had no thought of you? That we never looked for- ward to the time when we would all be together again? That our toil to supply the wants of the present had not also blended with it a hope for the future?" Oh, would he, in this crisis of his life, be- lie her trust? Would any ignoble selfishness prevent his accepting, in the same spirit with which it was given, her offering of affection? Would any spark of that low envy kindle in his breast, that, after all his toils, from another's hand he must receive the object of his ambi- tion?

Instead of any answer he sank on the sod at her feet, and raised his eyes to heaven. "God!" he said, "I thank thee! Make me worthy- make me worthy of this love!" "But tell me, Rose," Frank said, when they were calmer and could converse-" tell me how you managed it. I am sure the thought that you could attempt such a thing never once en- tered my mind. From this day, I am an advo- cate of the superior wisdom of woman!  "Not wisdom, perhaps, so much as persever- ance,' Rose answered, laughing. "But you must not speak, brother, as if I did it all; mamma's and Kate's help were worth every thing-we all worked toward one common end. But you want to know how it came about? Well,. I had often admired this knoll, with the green meadows around it; and often said that if we should ever have a place of our own, I hoped it might be such an one. At last, one day, Mr. Lee-you did n't know it belonged to him-did you?"  "No," said Frank, greatly interested; "go on." i            -       270   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. "Well, he said, one day, when I was speaking thus-' I tell you what it is, Rose-if ever I think of selling that bit of ground, you shall have the first chance, if you agree to its present price.' "Of course, I looked on it as a jest, then; and laughingly told him it was but a poor bar- gain on his side, for property was sure to rise in value. "No matter,' he said, 'if he thought it enough.' "That was the first year after you left us. I had almost forgotten the idle speech-for so I re- garded it-when we began the little shop; but, a few months after, when its success was almost assured, Mr. and Mrs. Lee called one evening, to satisfy themselves of our prosperity; and, in the course of conversation, referred to it again. "'I have not forgotten my promise, Miss Rose,' he said, gayly; 'though it seems you have. Do n't you think-if you still wish for those pretty acres-you had better close with it now? Yes, Rose,' he went on, 'I do think, from your present business, that you could- paying for it gradually, in small installments- own the little farm you so much covet, in per- haps two years.' "'Oh, Mr. Lee,' I said, 'you are too, too kind! how can I thank you?'   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    27I "'By taking my offer-if you and your mother really wish it.' "Mamma was as much delighted as I; but we both insisted that he should make the price approximate, at least, to its then value. He would not hear of it.  "'Fie! fie!' he said to me.; 'to be a lady, and yet break your word! No, no, Miss Rose! do n't you remember our old agreement? You are bound, in honor, not to draw back.' "Then, turning to mamma, both he and his wife entreated her not to deny their request. What could we do but gratefully consent? "When we ceased to hear from you, he of- fered, if we wished, to release us from the con- tract; but we could not give up faith in your return, and so we all worked on-hoping for the best, till you came back. "You would have heard all this long before, but there was one more payment still to make; and we wished to have the surprise complete." "Tell me, Rose," said Frank, when she had concluded her little tale-" tell me truly, have I, through, these past four months, been in any thing more patient, more persevering than I was of old?" "You have, indeed, my dearest, dearest brother!' You do not know how you have sat- isfied mamma's heart." '"Oh, Rose," he went on, "in that long-ago     272   ROSE CARLETONI'S REWARD. time, I am afraid I thought myself no mean Christian. I see, now, how lacking I was in that which is the very root and spring of all Christian excellence -humility. I was ever laying plans for the future; I was ever acting for it; I was ever despising the precious pres- ent. Your constant aim was to fulfill the duties of to-day, and trust the future to a higher Guid- ing. Yet it was you who most truly and ear- nestly provided for that future, when the means were in your hands." "I had helps, dear brother, that you had not; you praise me far too much. And remember, Frank, though the work is begun, it is not at all completed; you are our great dependence for that. We have yet to find means for building our house; and the farm must be brought into greater culture. It is but a little one, Frank- only fifty acres. But you know the old adage- 'A little farm well tilled;' and, perhaps we can enlarge it in time." "It seems almost a pity, Rose," said Frank, "to give up your little store; the people like you so well, and you have had such success." "But there is no need, brother; at any rate, for the present; and if I choose to do so, Kate and Nora will be glad to take my place, and let me be the stay-at-home." "What a dauntless little toiler you are!"   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    273 said Frank, laughing-gazing on her with loving pride. "Ah, Rose,", he went on, in a graver vein, "how often I have called to mind our con- versation before I went away; when you said thati the path of patient, persevering effort was that on which we could be most sure God's blessing would rest-it has rested on you, sweet sister! May I, too, choose that path in future." "We'will walk in it together, dearest brother!" she replied, rising, and linking her arm in his; and together they turned to descend the slope. The forest, "aflame with gorgeous hues," crowned the heights behind them; the sunlight sparkled on the waters of the brook that mur- mured at their feet, and on the river in the dis- tance; and the vivid emerald of the grass bright- ened beneath its rays. Below, in the valley, lay the little town, spread out, like a panorama, be- fore their gaze-its streets the scene of busy, happy life. Nature and humanity both seemed to echo the peaceful thanksgiving for the past- the joyous hope for the future that throbbed in their young hearts. I 8 a    .         CHAPTER XX. Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. Psalms. A HE morrow was a Saturday-Kate's holiday; and she and Mrs. Carleton had gone to enjoy it at farmer Lee's, whither the rest were to follow in the evening. Eight o'clock had not yet struck, nor had Frank yet left the house-some reason having caused him for once to depart from his usual punctuality. Nora was in the garden, and he and Rose were alone together in the little shop, busily talking, when a stranger opened the door. "Does Mrs. Carleton live here?" he asked. "I was directed to this house." "She does, sir," Rose replied; "but she is not at home to-day. Perhaps you can leave the message with me-I am her eldest daughter." "Certainly," he answered, courteously. "In- deed, it is more particularly addressed to you. (274)   ROSE CARIETON'S REWARD.     275 May I ask a few questions? The lady whom I represent was very anxious to be satisfied as to your identity with the family she sought." Rose realdily consented, and requested him to take a seat; while she and Frank waited with no slight curiosity for what he had to say. A few inquiries removed his doubts; and, giving into Rose's custody a letter and a large package, resembling a box, which he had placed on the counter at his entrance, he took his leave, say- ing that the letter would best explain the cause of his visit. Brother and sister could scarcely control their impatience till the door had closed, and they were alone once more; then Rose turned to examine the missive. "There is something familiar in the hand- writing," she said to Frank, who leaned over the back of her chair; "but I can not recall whose it could be." "Open it, and see!"' he laughed; and, no less eager, she broke the seal, and read, in tearful wonderment, what follows: "My DEAR ROSE :-If I may still call you so -I fear that the name which ends this sheet will bring to mind more sad than pleasant mem- ories; but it were surely cruel wrong to your gentle nature, to believe that you do not still )      '     276   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. think kindly of her who was the merry play- mate of your childhood-the loved and loving friend of later days. Yes, dearest Rose, though I do not conceal from myself that my poor, unhappy brother was the cause of your father's ruin-perhaps of his death, which, I know since, happened soon after-I yet feel sure you often revert fondly and regretfully, as I do, to the dear old days of intimacy, with thoughts unsullied by any harsh judgment of those who caused the change. "But you will be wondering how I came to write this letter; the history is brief. Some months after you left Ireland, my dear brother died. His mind had never been entirely at rest after your father's disasters, and, falling into ill health, the news of his death affected him still more. Reckless and wrong in his conduct though he seemed, and much as he had outraged your father's confidence, he had a feeling heart; and I am certain that, at the time of your de- parture, he suffered keenest agony, though too proud to sue for the pardon which only waited - his asking. As the end drew near, he repented i more and more his life's errors, but, most of all, his conduct to your father, who had been our parents' friend as well as ours; and one of his last and most impressive charges to me was, that should an opportunity of rendering any   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    2" little service to your rnother or her children present itself, I was not, for his sake, to let it pass. "We had lived, even prior to his death, in very reduced circumstances, and afterward, I was, of course, poorer still; so an aunt, who had long before emigrated to America, sending me an invitation to join her, I gladly accepted. On my journey, when I reached Liverpool, I endeavored to discover the inn at which you had stopped, that I might, if possible, learn something of your history-and, fortunately, succeeded. Once having convinced the land- lady that I had been your, friend, it was easy to lead her into conversation, for she had been charmed with you all; and, when her honest heart was completely assured as to my good intentions, she told me that, in the hurry and confusion of leave-taking, you had forgotten a valuable writing-desk, which she had carefully preserved, in the hope of meeting some one whom she could trust to deliver it to- you. I joyfully seized the opportunity of rendering even so small a kindness, and fulfilling, in part, my sacred promise; and persuaded her to con- sign it to my care. I will not weary you with the detail of my search for your abode-I ob- tained the needed information through various sources; and one of my cousins being about to     278  ROSE CARLETON'S REW'ARD. journey to an eastern city, he consented to un- dertake the task of delivering my precious charge. Precious, I know, it will be to you, for I am almost certain it is the desk your father used; I would it contained untold treas- ures to bless you on the opening. But though the service I have rendered is so trifling, you will think none the less kindly of the willing heart which prompted it, and gently and for- givingly of him who is at rest. "And now, good-by. It is not likely we will ever meet in this world; but, to the last of life, the thought of you, and our early friendship, will warm the sorrowing and stricken heart of her who pens these lines." The tears fell thick and fast from Rose's eyes as she reached the close. "We had forgiven him long atgo-had we not, Frank?" she sobbed. Yes, dearest, yes!" he answered, comforting her. "You had, I am sure. But there is some- thing strange about this desk, Rose," he went on, removing its covering; "I am certain we have one exactly like it." "So we have!" she exclaimed, examining it- "mamma's, you know. She always preferred a large one, and so papa bought her the mate to his. Oh, Frank, I remember now! The lock   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    279 of his was a little defective, and so they ex- changed, that he might have the one most secure in which to bestow his most valuable papers; and, in the hurry of leave-taking, he must have mistaken his own for it. You re- member, we never discovered our loss till after our landing. I had forgotten all about it since." "So had I," added Frank. "Yes, this must be the one. How much we regretted its loss at first, for we could not tell how important its contents might have been." "It is locked," said Rose; "maybe mamma's key can open it-you will find it in her room, brother, Oh, I wonder-I wonder if it could be possible!" she cried, as some new thought crossed her mind; and paced the floor in ex- cited impatience till his return. He was not long in coming; and soon the desk lay open to their search. Rose did not speak; but her trembling hands sought eagerly through the bundles of old letters and tape-tied papers for a little drawer, which she dimly re- membered. A cry of joy announced her dis- covery; and, leaning forward, Frank saw a small ornament yield to the pressure of her finger, and out flew a tiny compartment alto- gether filled with a compact roll of papers carefully enveloped. He caught them up with a sudden eagerness, for her look had flashed a    '-"     280  ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. new light on his mind, too; and tore away the covering. No, she had not been mistaken; within their hands lay the long-lost, almost-forgotten five hundred dollars, for which they had so vainly searched in the dark extremity of their first or- phanage! "O Frank!" said Rose, when she could at last believe it, "if we had but known of this before! all the sadness and separation of these five years might have been spared!" "Dear sister '" he answered, "do not regret it. For me-I must always grieve for the dis- tress my rash, impatient course brought on all so dear to me; yet I can see, now, how gracious was the Hand which guided. Had we found this when we so desired it, who can say how I might have thwarted the good it should have brought, in useless striving for something be- yond my reach? But I have learned a lesson, Rose ; experience and your dear and beautiful example have not failed to show me my own lack. Henceforth, whatever of good my life may show,-will-under heaven-be due to her whose faith, and love, and true humility are my highest ideal of womanhood!" Oh, was not this reward enough for all the toil and trial? To reign so in his heart-to, more than all, have led the brother so beloved   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.    28I to the only source of true humility and power -to have deepened in him all the springs of Christian life. Meek heroine! on thy fair brow could have been set no crown more coveted or precious! Clasped to his heart-her happy face hidden on his breast-she whispered softly through her tears: "So all things work together for good-do they not, dear brother?" "To those who love God, and serve him through joy and sorrow--as you have done, sweet Rose!-as I hope to do more truly in the,future." And now I will not linger to describe the cozy little homestead which so soon graced that smooth, green knoll; nor the gladsome xay when they took possession of it-all their own, unincumbered by any debt; nor the happy months they spent the next summer, when Mrs. Kennedy and two of her little flock paid their long-promised visit, and Jack Rivers and his mother became their loved and honored guests. We bid them all adieu now, at the threshold of a life of joyous and earnest activi- ties, and blessed by God and man. Frank's only regret was, that Alfred Howard     282   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD. and his father should not know him to be guilt- less of the crime laid to his charge; but even in this he was satisfied in after years. For, chancing to meet with them through the inter- course of business, he learned, from their lips, how all suspicion of stain on his character had long since been effaced by the dying confession of Mr. James-acknowledging the snare he had laid for the young stranger's feet, in order to cast on another the burden of his own guilt; and ,then Frank knew whose had been the treacherous hand that placed the fatal signs of crime in the small, square cedar box; and then he saw the reason of the sudden promo- tion which had so perplexed him at the time. I need not say how Alfred exulted in this proof that his boyish confidence had not been mis- placed, nor tell how ample was the restitution accorded Frank for the unwitting wrong. Although he heard, from time to time, of their welfare, with Mr. Greyson or his family he never met again; but, treasured among the dearest memories of his youth, was that brief and happy year he spent beneath their roof. I would fain hope that my little story has not altogether failed to teach the lesson for which it was written: that humble, patient fulfillment of the present hour's duties is all that is re- quired of us; we have no cause for discontent   ROSE CARLETON'S REWARD.     283 if we are but doing that aright, for God does not lay on us the burden of the future-we may well trust that to his gracious keeping. Nor will "patient continuance in well doing" fail of its reward, though no success should crown us here; if we but continue " faithful to the end," with what rapturous, humble hope may we not look forward to the verdict: "She hath done what she could?" when a life which knows not any fruitless labor, or bitter woes of earth, but an eternity of blessed activities, opens before our gaze.
