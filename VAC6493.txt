                 BENDING WILLOW: A TALE OF  BY  JANE GAY FULLER. NJ   NEW YORK: ROBERT CARTER AND BROTHERS, 530 BROADWAY. 1872.     Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by ROBERT CARTER &    BROTHERS, In the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.   PREFACE. WHLE travelling in the Northwest, a few years since, and during a temporary residence there, the author of this little work collected a quantity of crude material, illustrative of Indian life, character, customs, and religious belief, a portion of which is embodied in the following narrative. Tales, vague as the myths of Greece, and wonderful as those of, the elder Edda, are scattered all over r own' border-land-tales of the earth "when it was new ;" tales of the origin of man and of the races; of the origin of beast, bird, fish and reptile; of the sun, moon, and stars; tales of heroes, demi-gods and fiends, more in number than the Arabian tales, and of deeper significance. Many of these are evidently of Oriental origin, and should be preserved, not (3)     4         PRiEFACE. only as memorials of a fading race, but as cor- roborative testimony in proof of the unity of man. The widow of a late Chippewa interpreter, himself a Chippewa half-breed, and member of their "great mystery" fraternity, W. W. Warren, placed in my hands a mass of her hus- band's manuscripts, containing many legends which, she said, he had travelled from tribe to tribe to obtain from the old men. Such of them as I have introduced in my little book are changed only in dress. I have endeavored to be as accurate in the description of scenery and places as in the customs and habits of the red men. As for Paul Lindall, James West, and the other characters of the book, their names will not be recognized on the frontier, but their prototypes are there, and in the hearts of the children of the forest. -The missionary's hymns are still heard by the waters of the beautiful lake, and the church he planted in the wilder- ness is a living witness to his faithful labors.

HERE is a clear, pleasant lake in the Northwest, named by the white men "Silver Lake," on account of the exceeding purity of its waters. The Indians call it "The Water .of the Great Spirit." No storms ever ruffle its sur- face; no winds lash it to foam and madness. It lies like a great, polished mirror in the forest, with its narrow frame of sand and pebbles, amid which sparkle bright-red car- nelions and richly-veined agates. Curious purple moccasin flowers nod over the little streamlets that trickle into the lake; pale (7)     8      BENDING WILLOW. pipsissiwas lift their waxen bells out of their coronals of green leaves, and gay pinxters and sweet wild wood honey-suckles waft delicious fragrance far out on the Shining waters. For ages no white man's foot ever wan- dered over the paths that led to the Silver Lake. The wild elk and bison drank of its waters, while the timid deer and spotted fawn lay down to sleep on its margin. They were safe there, for no deadly arrow sped by the Lake of the Great Spirit. Nearly a half century -since, one of the chiefs of the Northern Pillagers made an en- campment on its margin. He was the son of a renowned Chippewa warrior, named Black Cloud, who fell in the land of the Dacotahs. The Chippewas and Dacotahs are heredi- tary foes. The oldest men of neither nation can tell the origin of their animosity, but agree that it was a quarrel of their fathers, when the earth was new, and they must never bury the tomahawk. White Cloud, who was a child when his   THE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.  9 father fell, was often told tho sad story of his surprise and massacre, and instructed to believe there was a heavy debt of blood on his hands, to repay as soon as he should arrive at the years of manhood. He accord- ingly inured himself to hardships, spent days and nights in the forest, battling with the elements, and with wild beasts; followed thie old hunters to the chase, and the old warriors on their trail, until every path of the North- west was as familiar to him as the paths of his native village. While other youths of his age were playing mimic games, and decorating themselves with feathers of the spotted partridge or gayer red- bird, White Cloud was winning eagles' feathers for a chaplet, and thus preparing to lead a war-party himself to the land of their ene- mies. When -a white youth goes to war, he is allowed to put on badges, and march side by side with veterans. He may cheer his flag and huzza with the loudest, whether the hour     10      BENDING WILLOW. of danger find him a hero or a coward. But the red youth can follow renown only in the path of humiliation. When he goes forth with warriors, he must go without :paint or feather. He must walk behind his elders on the trail. He must turn his back, to the enemy's country whenever he pauses to eat or sleep. He must, in fact, submit to be called a coward until he has proven himself a mma). It avails him nothing to say, "I have fought," or, "I can fight!"He must show his trophies. White Cloud had submitted to all this degradation, and been crowned at last in the presence of his whole tribe. I think it might please some of my young readers to know how an Indian warrior wins his plumes, since they cannot be picked up as easily, or worn as lightly, as the school- boy trainer picks up his cockerel feathers for dress-parade. The eagle's feather is never worn for mere ornament. It is a badge of honor, reserved for thoe who have distin-   THE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.   " guished themselves in war. It is never con- ferred except on the brave. When a war-party is returning home, it is met and welcomed with songs and dances. If it has been victorious and taken many scalps, the young womeiA and boys snatch them from the hands of the warriors, and lead the way to an open square in the midst of the village, where the noisy scalp-dance is begun. This is one of the few dances in which women and men mingle together without reserve. The musicians with their drums and fifes are seat- ed in the centre of the open space, and the dancers circle around them, holding aloft the scalps as banners, while they chant the praises of their victors. Sometimes these dances are performed night after night, with the wildest outhurst of merriment and exulta- tion, while the old warriors are reposing on their laurels. But after the first enthusiasm has ex- hausted itself in the boisterous scalp-dance, there follows another dance, called the victory-     12     BENDING WILLOW. dance, in which the victors are crowned. This is performed with great gravity and so- lemnity. The women and boys now take their accustomed places in the background, and the 'oldest and wisest men of the nation gather as for council. Then, every warrior comes in his war-dress, with his face newly painted, and his weapons by his side, to itell his exploits in the presence of the aged. A tall war-stake, painted red, is planted for the occasion, like a patriotic liberty-pole for the Fourth of July. Around this red stake all who have taken any part in the receint fight, dance to the stirring music of their national battle-songs. They never join hands, but go in single file as on the march, the war- chief leading, and bearing in his hand an ensign of eagles' feathery. The warriors, according to age or rank, follow, every one holding aloft the scalps he has taken. Three times they move slowly in circle around the red pole; then their leader leaves the ring, and going to the war-stake, strikes it with his   THWE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT. ' 13 club, which is the signal for silence. The drums of the musicians suddenly cease to beat, the dancers stand still, and the spectators preserve the strictest silence. The leader then points away toward the land of their enemies, and says solemnly, "With the aid of spirits I led the young men to the country of our enemies. They have stained their hands r;ith the color of their blood. We have made the nation to weep as women. We have destroyed their lodges; we have sent their boldest leaders howling on the 'Road of Souls.' The spirits of our brave will rejoice, because their enemies are now their slaves. Your war-chief considers him- self a man. In the battle he saw none before him. He led his young men in the thickest of the fight as coolly as he led them on the trail. With his own arm he struck down four Daco- tahs, and brought home their scalps. He has done." Four sharp yells, as many as the number of scalps shown, follow this boastful tale of     "     BENDING WILLOW. exploits. Then one of the oldest warriors of the nation approaches the leader, who is waiting beside the red-stake, and puts in his head-dress as many new eagles' feathers as he has slain enemies. Loud shouts of applause and triumph greet the newly-crowned, and the dance is renewed with more vigor than at first. Three times they circle the war-stake again, when another warrior le'ves the ring to tell his valorous deeds, and receive the reward of his bravery. And so the victory-dance goes on, until every victor in the ring has struck the war-stake, told his story, and been crowned. And this is the way the red soldier wins his eagle feathers. I think my young readers will agree with me that they are pretty dearly earned. In this same manner young White Clond had been crowned three times on his return from the war-path, before reaching the years of manhood. Then he gained permission of the old men to raise a war-party of his own, and go forth to avenge his father's death.   THE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.  15 Forty of the bravest young men of his tribe responded to the call of. their youthful chief. and preparations for departure were com- menced without delay. I must tell you another Chippewa custom. When a war-party is formed, two lodges are usually constructed outside the principal vil- lage. One of these is very long and open; and for three days and nights the'warriors of the nation, old and young, assemble within it, to dance the national dances, sing the national war-songs, invoke dream-spirits, and perform numerous other ceremonies. The scalp-locks of the young men who have never been out on the war-path are there braided for the first time amid, the'exhortations of the veterans. While the remainder of the hair is cut very closely, this one lock that covers the scalp is left as a defiant challenge to an enemy to take if he can get it. The other lodge is smaller than the first, and more retired and close. It is not for singing, or dancing, or any other warlike pre-     16     BENDING WILLOW. paration. It is the lodge where the great Medawe, or-l Mystery Men, fast and pray, and consult oracles. It is there they look into Ke-saub-un-ge-gun, or "Futurity glass," and see the paths by which spirits lead mortals. One olkd medicine-man, of the tribe, with the very singular name of "Listen-to-the-end," had talked with spirits from his boyhood. They had often pointed out to him the best paths for the warriors, shown him ambuscades and secret lurking places, and how to avoid them. Every one of his tribe believed in him, and believed also that it was because his warnings were unheeded, that Black Cloud and his party fell by the springs of the Upper Min- nesota; and never since had a war-leader neglected his counsel. For many years after the slaughter of Black Cloud, this old Medawe used to accompany such parties as guide, or spiritual leader; rearing his little lonely lodge whenever the warriors made an encampment. He was with White Cloud when he won his first trophies,   THE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.  17 and the young chief regarded him with the love and reverence of a parent. But his steps were now too feeble to follow on the trail. Age and long fastings had worn him, until his silvery hair seemed floating around a shadow. White Cloud was often in com- munion with the old man, and more frequently than ever, after he assumed the responsibility of a leader. On the last night of the preparation in the great lodge, in the midst of the revelry, a messenger silently beckoned the young chief aside. He understood the summons, and fol- lowed without a word. As the noise of the revellers behind him grew fainter, the solemn tones of invocation burst on his ears, and he recognized at once the voice of Listen-to-the- end. He paused. It was not long before other voices were heard rising with his, and the little lodge at length seemed bursting with triumphal music. By this token, White Cloud knew they had a revelation. Hie sat down on a fallen pine, to await the 2     18     BENDING WILLOW. coming forth of his friend, for no unhallowed footstep may enter the sacred tent. The moon and stars shed down a soft light, there in the broken forest; the shadows of the tender poplar leaves quivered on the green moss; the wild grape hung in arches across the wood- paths to the Southwest-the paths by which he would lead the braves, for the first time, at break of day. The sounds from the lodge soon died away in silence. Then the skin curtain was lifted, and the form of the old Medawe appeared in the moonlight. He was much bent, and came forward slowly, leaning on a pine staff; bht the fire of youth and enthusiasm shone brightly in his eyes, as he fixed them on the young man, and said: "Listen, my son! The spirits are favor- able, and have opened our eyes. They show us an open path to the Southwest. It touches not the old springs, but leads by the waters of the Great Spirit. The warriors will pause there and make an encampment. Food is   THE LAKE OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.  19 plenty; the waters of the lake are sweet and pleasant. When the warriors return there, laden with trophies from the springs of the Minnesota, they will find their wives and little ones waiting for them. Listen-to-the-end will go with them there, and lay his bones by the Lake of the Great Spirit." Early the next morning, the Chippewa warriors, newly painted, and in single file, turned their faces toward the land of their enemies. It was a long adieu to their native river of the North; for, following the old Medawe's instructions, White Cloud's entire band went forth from the parent tribe, to plant itself in a new home to the Southwest. U   pT,     II. THE NEW HOME. HTE CLOUD'S mother still lived, and was one of the very first of the band to strike her wigwam for the new home:. She had never been fully reconciled to the long winters and deep snows of the Pillager country  . having been born on the south shore of Ottertail. The Lake of the Great Spirit was not far beyond, only a little nearer to the setting sun. The name of this woman was Neenaka. She was the daughter of the old chief, Big Marten, who used to be a leader among the northern tribes. Neenaka was very proud of her son, and would have followed him on his war-paths, (20) /   THE NEW HOME.      21 had the custom of her nation permitted. She had no other child, and never had but one other, the tender little Blue Bird, who perished in her arms the winter of the great pestilence, when the Pillagers made many new graves. The emigrating party made their way slowly through the big woods, and over wide prairies, following in the very footsteps of the young men who had gone before them. The print of their moccasins was still visible on the sandy shores of the Elkhorn where they paused to drink, a sight that cheered their eyes. They had all the old men and women of their division with them, as well as the frail helpless little ones-not one was left behind. They had their tepees and furniture, their seed-corn and implements of husbandry, and only a few poor, shaggy ponies for those who were too weak to walk. Most of the burdens were borne on the backs of the young women, who were very happy, nevertheless, following their husbands and lovers. ,               .(     22     BENDING WILLOW. Nothing befel the party by the way, and they reached the borders of the lake early in June, in time to break the ground for their cornfields. When the warriors returned, the green blades were already piercing the rich soil. Then, for the first time, the silent waters of the peaceful lake awoke to the shouts of savage mirth and triumph. The victors had come laden with trophies and spoils, without the loss of a single man. They had brought many horses, and buffald-robes, and martin- skins, in addition to their scalps. They had three captives also, from a village they de- stroyed on the Minnesota. White Cloud had thus avenged the death of his father, and his heart was glad. He had never been taught any higher rule of action than revenge; had never heard of "love to enemies," or of Him who inculcated it. His Great Spirit dwelt in the clouds; spoke in the thunder; could be propitiated by charms; loved a brave man, and hated a coward. It d   THE 2NEW HOME.      23 was to such a being the red men offered their prayers for protection and safety, and on whose altars they laid their sacrifices of thanksgiving. Old Listen-to-the-end was one of the minis- ters of this religion, and performed its rites with a fidelity worthy of a better faith. While the shouts of welcome to the returning braves were still in his ears, he went away to a lonely spot on the border of the lake and chanted a spirit-song, keeping time with his string of mystic rattles. It was the highest praise his darkened mind had any conception of, and there is little doubt the All-hearing ear drank it in, -and the All-merciful heart accepted of it as much as was worthy. Neenaka had been ill for' some days, and did not go forth to meet the warriors, and mingle in the scalp-dance. She was sitting alone in her wigwam, listening for the steps of her son, when the young chief entered, bear- ing what looked like a great bundle in the dusky light of evening.     24     BENDING WILLOW. "Mother," he said, "I have brought home little Neesheka (sister), who was laid to sleep, away by our Northern river. Give the Blue Bird welcome." "White Cloud has done well!" replied the old chieftainess, in a choking tone, snatching up the new-found treasure as she spoke, and pressing it to her heart, as though it had been in truth her own lost child. "Wlaubegoon! * Waubegoon! the heart of your mother; was breaking while she waited for your brother to lead you back from the .dead. Waubegoon! Waubegoon! you Will leave your old mother no more." The little captive, whose father's scalp was at that very moment waving in triumph through the village, was thus tenderly adopted into the family of the young chief.- Such adoption of prisoners is very common among the forest tribes, and its ties are held as sacred as the ties of blood. Time passed, and White Cloud's band * Little Flower! Little Flower!   THE NEW ROME.      25 grew large and prosperous in its new home. No old men now perished of weakness, nor children in their mothers' arms. The winters were milder than they had been accustomed to, the soil more fertile. Their corn grew tall and ripened; they had no more famine nor pestilence. Game was abundant in the forest, and fish in the lake and rivers. White Cloud saw his people growing thick as leaves, and spreading wide. He had become as great a warrior as his father, and his name was a terror to the Dacotahs. Old Listen-to- the-end still lived, and saw realized all that the spirits had shown him in the .Ke-saub-un- ge-gun. About this time an event occurred that in its results has much to do with our story. A party of hunters who had been down to a trading-post near Fort Snelling, returned with a white man unguarded and unarmed. He was a young man, with a high, fair brow, soft brown hair, and hands as delicate as a     26     BENDING WILLOW. woman's. He, asked to be conducted to their chief. White Cloud received him at the door of his wigwam, and was made to understand that the pale face wished to come and dwell among his people, and teach them the customs and religion of the whites. The chief handed him his pipe, and, while the stranger made a show of smoking it, sat down thoughtful and silent. It was drawing toward evening; he made no effort to converse, but rose at length and beck- oned him into the cabin, where his mother and the little adopted girl were preparing the sup- per of hominy and wild rice. A blanket was spread, and a dish set before the stranger, who was hungry and weary with his long march through the wilderness. White Cloud did not stay to eat. Leaving his guest to the tender hospitalities of Neen- aka and the child, he stole quietly away to the lodge of his aged friend and counsellor, Listen-to-the-end. He found him sitting be- fore his door, gazing with a rapt countenance   TIE NEEW 0OME.      27 on the purple and golden clouds which the day was hanging around the setting sun. His dark eyes were full of visions. For some minutes, he took no notice of the young chief, whose eyes following his, discerned only the glory of an autumn evening-cloud piled above cloud in gorgeous splendor and reflect- ed in rainbow tints on the bosom of the lake. White Cloud was brave, but not imaginative. He thought that distant sky-range, on which the old man was gazing so steadfastly, looked like peaks of the Rocky Mountains at sunset, and nothing more. The brightness faded at last, and a soft pearly mist gathered over the lake. Listen- to-the-end then turned to the waiting chief and said: "Are your eyes shut, my son, that you can- not discern the forms of the departed? They wander back to-night on the Road of Souls. They linger here by the waters of the Great Spirit. They have words for the chief!"     28     BENDIAN WILLOW. "White Cloud's ears are open, if his eyes are shut," he replied, sententiously. "They say," pursued the old Medawe, "that a stranger comes with words from the Master of Life for the red men. Let their chief give him welcome. He will show them a time when the tomahawk shall be buried by the nations, and peace shall wipe out every stain of blood."  "The words of Listen-to-the-end ar'e good," replied the chief. "He speaks not with a forked tongue. Neenaka has spread a blanket for the new teacher ip the wigwam of White Cloud. He comes to dwell among the red men by the Lake of the Great Spirit." An   "I, THE CHEF OF THE WHTE HAND. THE name of the new teacher was Paul Lindall. He was a native of the "Old Bay State," and one of the last of a now extinct family. Lindall was a scholar and an enthusiast. From boyhood, he had brooded much overf' the wrongs of the red men. His favorite school declamation was that oft-repeated speech of Logan the Mingo; and before his college course was ended, he, was nursing a thought that ripened at last into a firm purpose to become, like the apostle Elliott, a teacher and preacher to the fading race- "Whose names are written on the mountains, Whose voices mingle in the fountains." (29)     30     BENDING WILLOW. His labors began on a small reservation in New York, and were shared by a devoted wife, one whom he had loved, and who had loved him in return, almost from childhood. But these labors were not prospered. The red men of the old States, coming in contact with civilization, had contracted its lowest vices, and cared nothing for the pious pre- cepts and examples of their good teachers, For several years they wrought unweariedly amid trial and discouragements, before resolv- ing to seek a new field in the wilds of the far West, where the Indian roamed. in his native forest, the true lord of the soil. A solitary trading-post then marked the site of the present beautiful city of St. Paul. A lonely fort had been planted just above, whose rocky ramparts twice a year echoed the wel- come whistle of a government steamer. From the deck of one of those biennial supply-boats, Paul Lindall, with his wife and child, caught his first glimpse of the great Northwest. Day after day, they stemmed the current of   THE CHEF OF TH WHTE HAND.   31 the forest river, startling flocks of wild fowl from the rocky islands, and flocks of wilder men along the banks. Nothing they had ever. conceived of grandeur, was like the grandeur of this "Father of floods," with its towering bluffs, and castellated rocks, Nature's own masonry, scoffing at decay and time. Day after day, I said, they journeyed on- for no pilot was then bold enough to dare the snaggy depths of the unfrequented river by night-until they came to anchor at length under the rocky walls of Snelling, at the mouth of the beautiful Minnesota, or "Rliver of the Sky." The two or three officers of the post and their families welcomed the strangers with a warmth reflected only in solitudes where the heart faints for the "low sweet music of humanity." But they stood aghast on learn- ing their destination . To go unarmed into a wilderness, that no white man's foot had press- ed, was little less than courting destruction. In their eyes, the red men were irreclaimable.     32     BENDING WILLOW. Neither civilization nor Christianity, time nor circumstance, could ever obliterate the instinc- tive treachery of the race, any more than they could wipe off the copper stain from the skin. Both lay deeper than birth marks; they ex- isted in the very nature, and only awaited time and opportunity to manifest themselves. Paul Lindall met all these arguments with the simple orthodoxy, that all tendencies exist  in the nature, and are transmissible; otherwise there would be no peculiarities of nation or race. That no sin, either in red man or white, is too  deep or dark for the grace of God, whose    I action and effect are to change nature. He  looked forward to a time when men of every color and race would worship the true God, recognize the claims of a common brother- hood, and cease to do each other wrong. To teach this doctrine to the down-fallen, he was willing to pass his life in the wilderness. There is a moral charm in self-abnegation, that lifts even the common-place to the heights of the heroic. We admire men who,   THE CHEF OF THE WHTE HAND.   33 for love of country, will stand on its outposts ;o guard it from danger. We yield some- hing more than admiration, we bow in reve- :ence to those who, for the love of God and Lumanity, are ready to take their lives in their Lands, and forsake all things that life holds ear. Scarcely had, the Lindalls reached Fort nelling, before the party of Pillager hunters ame down to the post with their furs and dins. Lindall saw in it the finger of Provi- ence. With the aid of an interpreter, he as able to ascertain something of the history their band, its strength and locality. The tnters described their new home as a para- se; told of their beautiful lake which the -eat Spirit guarded from storm and tempest; their wide forests of game, and streams of h. In still warmer terms, they praised their ung chief, who watched over his people e a father, and was the bravest of the brave. arming with their enthusiasm, the good ssionary determined to leave his wife and 3     34     BENDING WILLOW. daughter for a brief period, and return with the huhters. The little aid he received bound him to no locality, but left him free to select his own field of labor. A journey of five days brought them to the borders of the forest lake. Very few of the Indians there had then seen a white man. They had no annuities from govern- ment, consequently little to tempt the avari- cious trader. White Cloud himself had never visited " the circle of big guns," as they called the fort, but had once been to a Catholic Mission on the Upper Mississippi, and the little chapel, with its mystic chancel and crosses, the little school-room where chil- dren were holding books, and the neatly cul- tivated garden around the missionary's house, with its bright scarlet currants, and snowy- guelder-roses, had left an impression never effaced. Lindall spent a day or two examining the condition of the band, conversing by mingled signs and words with the old men in the   THE CHEF OF TEIz WHTE HAD.   35 council-place, and visiting the wigwams, where every one had a smiling welcome .for the stranger, the ' Chief of tie White Hand." He tarried longest at the lodge of the aged prophet, who, bent with extreme age, seldom went beyond the sunshine of his own door. Never bad his eyes rested on a form more venerable, or a face through which the human soul shone clearer, though lined and counter- lined with furrows. Listeunto-the-en-d was the patriarch as well as the prophet of his people, counting his life by generations instead of years. There was something serenely solemn in his dark eyes, and in the slow, measured cadence of his words, and in the long flowing locks of silvery hair that lent grace and grandeur to his age, like ivy on a ruined tower, or like the long- trailing southern moss that clings to the blasted oak when every green leaf has forsaken it. If the good missionary could have believed in the transmigration of souls, he would have fancied this old Ojibwa's had once animated     36     BENDING WILLOW. some high-priest of the Old Testament, and that the string of mystic charms around his neck was the veritable Urim and Thummim, whose virtues enabled him to give oracles to the people. Lindall liked the thought, thoughl he rejected the doctrine. His next fancy was a better one. He saw before him a Hebrew of the lost tribe., To relight the torch of his ancient faith, that had gone out in the mists of time and superstition, and to point him to the Lamb of God-the all-atoning sacrifice, would be more to him than labor and self- denial. Some secret sympathy seemed to attract the old Medawe and the young missionary from the first; something that could not be communicated by the mute language of signs, but which each unde'rstood. And when the young men came to help the "White Hand" rear his cabin, he pointed to a quiet spot on the shore of the lake, near the lonely lodge of Listen-to-the-end. And they said it was good that the Book-man and the great   THE CHEF OF TIE WHTE HAND.   37 iMedicine should dwell together like bro- thers. When the dwelling was completed and rendered as comfortable as a rude Indian cabin could well be made, the missionary set out again for the fort, accompanied by White Cloud and several of the bravest young men of the tribe, all mounted on horses, and eager to bring back the "Squaw of the White Hand" and his little one. Their arrival created quite a sensation at the fortress, where considerable secret apprehension had been felt for Lindall's personal safety. His wife, fortunately, had not shared in this apprehension, for her faith in the red men was scarcely less than that of. her husband, while her devotion to their work was as thorough and entire.  No regrets therefore filled her mind, as they prepared to leave the last outpost of civilization for a home in the wilderness beyond. The bedding and few other necessary articles of comfort which they had brought from the East, with the tent so kindly provided by the     38      BENDING WILLOW. officers of the garrison for their shelter by the way, were bound fast to the horses of the young Ojibwas who walked beside them. A gentle old army pony was provided for Mrts. Lindall, while little Faith, with a face that laughed all over at the grotesque preparations, was seated in front of her father, throwing kisses in handfuls back to the kind friends who had caressed her so abundantly during her brief stay with them, and who would gladly have detained her longer. White Cloud, in full feather, rode at the head of the procession. His face was bright with red paint; there were spots on his fore- head, spots on the tip of his nose, adc on both cheeks. His head was bare, an   e long black scalp-lock was braided on the top, and thrown back defiantly, as though lie scented Dacotahs, whose lands lay only across the river. Down his back hung a huge buffalo tail, which he wore as a charm, but which looked so exceedingly funny as nearly to convulse little Faith Lindall with laughter.   THE CHEF OF THE WHTE HAND.   39 A small guard of soldiers was detailed to accompany the party a few miles beyond the reservation, lest the wily Dacotahs might be on their track; and altogether it was as novel a cavalcade as ever defiled through the sally- port of Snelling, and provoked a smile even from the grim sentry at the gate. They took "-the path to the right, crossing the great prairie in the rear of the fort, and catching a glimpse of sweet-singing Minne-ha-ha as they passed. In less than an hour, the roar of old St. Anthony was in their ears. They paused for a moment to gaze on the cataract and on little Spirit Island below, where the mantle of the "Dark-day-Woman " has hung for centu- ries. Paul Lindall pointed out the island to his little girl; and as they rode forward, told her the sorrowful story of the mother and child who went over the cataract.     IV. NAN-UP-ASH-O. HE soldiers accompanied White Cloud's party as far as the first ford, a few miles above the Falls of St. Anthony, and saw them safely over on Ojibwa soil. Then the motley cavalcade moved on, leaving the river for the prairie- paths, that went stretching away miles and miles before them. A whole week was con- sumed on the journey, for, at the first symptom of weariness, the chief insisted on spreading their white tent (of which he was immoderately proud) for the pale woman and child to rest. Sometimes their stopping-place would be in the centre of a great plain, without an object for the eye to rest upon except the green, 40   NAN- UP-A SH- 0.     41 flower-spangled earth, and the blue heaven above. On every side they seemed shut in, like insects beneath a crystal bowl. Butas they journeyed on, beautiful openings would reveal themselves in orchard-looking groups of oaks, or patches of the hickory-pine peculiar to the far Northwest. Sometimes their tent was spread beside a clear lake, and their hunger regaled with the choicest fish. BNIt when at last the broad prairies were crossed, and they entered the deep woods, little Faith nestled closer to her father, while her brave-hearted mother trembled inwardly, but gave no outward sign of fear. Her husband was beside her, God was above; why should she yield to the shadowy influences of the forest? Mrs. Lindall was not one of those women whose heroism exhausts itself in talk, and is found wanting in the hour of trial. She was quietly and persistently courageous, less from natural intrepidity than from firmness of resolve.     42     BENDING WILLOW. At night, great fires were kindled to frighten the wolves away; but their barkings and howlings were plainly heard, sometimes inter- mingled with the cries of the catamount, and the mournful hoots of the forest owl. But from the little white tent, the evening hymn of the missionaries arose as clearly and sweetly as in the homes of civilization and peace, and their sleep in the forest was sweet. The next week found them in their cabin by Silver Lake, busy with arrangements and full of plans and hopes for the future. The language had to be learned before any great  amount of instruction could be conveyed, and Paul Lindall set himself to work with a patience and perseverance that never fails of success. His little daughter, in the mean time, was becoming the greatest possible favorite with the tribe, running from lodge to lodge at will, and picking up the language everywhere with the facility of childhood. The adopted child of the old chieftainess was her frequent com-   NAN- UP-ASH- 0.     43 panion, and the two children were very often at the lodge of the AMedawe, who enjoyed their simple prattle, and loved to tell them stories about the birds and plants, and strange forest legends, more fanciful than any fairy tales, little Weeneonka interpreting to Faith whatever she failed to comprehend. Faith's books interested the old man quite as deeply as his odd stories pleasa the children, and he watched her efforts to\ teach her young companion the mysterious characters, as eagerly as he strove to comprehend the meaning of the new teacher's words. But it was many weeks before the two ,children were able to make him understand the story of creation as narrated in the Bible. He listened attentively, shook his head, and replied: "The Ojibwas tell it differently! They say the Great Spirit made three first men, one black, one red, and one white. To the black man he gave a hoe and an axe; to the red man, a bow and arrow, a drum and rattle, and the best of all his land; to the white man he     "    BENDING WILLOW. only gave a book; but the book was full of knowledge and tatght him to outwit both the black and red man. Notwithstanding the loud boasting of his people, Listen-to-the-end be- lieves the white man got the best gift of the Great Spirit." Some time afterward Faith read, while Weenie, as she called her playmate, interpreted to him the story of the deluge. "That is good," he said. "Now I know the Great Spirit of the red and white man is the same, only the white man reads his words more plainly in the book he gave him. Our little ones will do well to read it too. It is better than the tales of Nan-up-ash-o." "Who was Nan-up-ash-o?"Faith inquired, eagerly. "The uncle of the human race; a mighty spirit who caused the flood. The Ojibwas believe he made a new world after the first one was destroyed." "What sort of a being was he, I would like to know?" ,.   NAN-UP-ASHB-O.     45 J "Very great," replied Listen-to-the-end. "He performed the most wonderful exploits; but sometimes gave the Great Spirit much trouble." "Wont you tell Faith how he caused the flood?" said little Weeneonka. "She would like to know." "Nan-up-ash-o killed the Prince of Serpents who had swallowed his adopted son. For this act the great waters were let loose upon him, until the whole earth was covered. Then he climbed up a pine tree, and as fast as the waters rose, made it grow under him. In this way he kept his head above water when everything else was deluged. By-and- by a musk rat came swimming past him. Nan-up-ash-o spake to it, and persuaded it to dive down under the waters and bring him up a clod of the old earth, which it did. Then he took the clod and made a new earth out of it. After planting it all over with pines from the tree thimt grew under hi, he set it afloat on the waters where it has floated ever since."     "     BENDING WILLOW. "But that couldn't have been this earth," said Faith, very wisely; " for our world doesn't float on the waters. It is as round as a ball, and swings in the blue air with nothing to hold it but God. But I would like to hear something more about that funny old Nan-up- ash-o. Who was his father, if he was zuncle to the human race?" "He had no father, but came into life in a very singular way. An old woman and her daughter lived alone in their wigwam on the first earth. A great hurricane arose and blew away the daughter, and destroyed the wig- wam. The poor woman searched everywhere among the ruins for her child, but could nowhere find her. At last she discovered a single drop of blood, which she gathered, care- fully and nursed until it became -a rabbit. From a rabbit it grew to be a man; and that was Nan-up-ash-o, viho ruled the winds and became almost as powerful as the Great Spirit himself." "I hope you do not believe such a silly \   NAN- UP-ASH-O.      47 story," said little Faith, who was holding fast one of the- old Medawe's hands. "It is one of the red men's traditions," he replied, gravely. "Listen-to-the-end was taught it just as the little one of the pale-face is taught the stories of her wonderful book." "But it is not true," persisted the child, with an earnestness peculiar to herself. "My father has come to teach you better things. God made the world and all that is in it! I shouldn't wonder if your Nan-up-ash-o was the devil," .     V. "STEN-TO-THE-END. T' was not long before Mr. Lindall learned enough of the language and of its natural signs to convey some of the simpler truths of the Old and New Testament to his Curious listeners. For nearly every Old Testament tale or narration, the Ojibwas hac a similar or parallel tale. But when he came to the story of the Babe of Bethlehem, and his wonderful lessons of love, self-denial, and forgiveness of enemies, his rebuke of evil, and his wonderful miracles on the earth, and of his painful death at the hands of those he had come to ransom and bring home to his Father's house, they shook tleir heads gravely, and said, "Our oldest story-tellers have told (48)   "ST EN-TO-THE-END.     49 us nothing like this. The red men would not thus have treated their Great Teacher." There was not one of all the tribe who listened to the missionary's words with the earnest .interest and childish humility of the venerable old man who had so long been the prophet and spiritual guide of his people, but whose h eart had often sunk within him for something higher and better than the traditions of the Medawe, or the dim visions of Ke-saub-un-ge-gun. There comes a time, sooner or later, to every honest, reflecting heart, whether savage or civilized, when in vain for doctrines are taught the traditions of men; for the human soul is wiser than all tradition, and gropes restless and unsatisfied until revel- ation points to its immortal possession. "Tell me more of this wonderful Being of yours," sail Listen-to-the-end, one evening when Mr. Lindall was sitting with him in his lodge, as he often did after his day's study was ended.  "The Ojibwas have no such High-priest or Teacher." 4     50     BENDING WILLOW. "Jesus Christ is the High-priest of the red men as well as the white men," replied the missionary. "His sacrifice was not confined to any particular nation or race. I came here to tell you of the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world, of the whole world, wherever he is known  and trusted. When I have learned your language better, I shall be able to explain more fully the nature and offices of this heavenly Priest- hood."  "Read from the little book the words you read last night. They are very plain. Listen- to-the-end pondered them much.  If the words are true, the red men are walking blindly." Lindall took from his pocket the Testament to which the old man referred, and read again, "Ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. "But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite- thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. ,   IISTEN-TO-TFE- E  D.   51 "And if any man will sue thee at thelaw, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. "And whosoever will compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. "Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away. "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. "But I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de- spitefully use you and persecute you. "That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and senleth rain on the just and on the unjust. "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? "And if ye salute your brethren only, what     52     BENDING WILLOW. do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? "Be ye therefore -perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." These few verses which are so easily read and understood by every child, had cost the good missionary much labor to interpret, or render in teims familiar to his hearers. But the Medawe comprehended them fully, for he had listened to them before. "If the new teacher's words are true," he said, in a mournful tone, "the old men have spoken falsely. They have taught that every injury is a debt to be repaid in full; that every drop of blood should be wiped out with blood; that the spirits of the dead call aloud for vengeance. That is what Listen-to-the-endc learned at the feet of the aged, when his heart was tender and soft. He used to weep then at sight of blood and turn away his head. His father was a chief, and wished his son to become a famous warrior. But when he fasted for his guardian spirit, there was only peace   "STEN-TO-THE-END.     53 in his dream. Listen-to-the-enci saw no scalps, no war-trails; but an old man came to him, and bade him look into futurity-glass. Ho looked, much afraid at first, and saw many things he did not understand. 'Look again, and listen,' said the spirit: 'Listen-to-tUie- Then, according to Ojibwa custom, the voice of his dream became his new name; the name his mother called him was sealed among his, mysteries and his no longer. Thenceforth he was to sit in the lodges of the Medawe until he should learn the wisdom of the aged, and understand the secrets of his nation. It was thus he became a "Great Medicine." For many years he followed the warriors to battle, but his scalp-lock was never braided. He went to point out the best paths, and to teach the braves mercy to women and children. He did not know that all war and fighting was evil in the eyes of the great Master of Life. "But the old man's eyes are now dim; his staff is broken. He has lived through many     54     - BENDING WILLVOW. strings* of lives.. Voices are calling him on the homeward road. The friends of his youth are lighting their torches to meet him beyond the sunset river. Soon the braves will turn his face to the west, and wrap his blanket around him for his long journey, while the new teacher tells them of the home of souls, where the spirit feels no more hunger, nor thirst, nor regret. Listen-to-the-end's work is done. He followed the best light the Great Spirit gave him, and asked for more. It has come to shine on his grave, and his heart is glad." "It has come in time to light him home to his Father's house " responded the warm- hearted missionary, moved to tears by the solemn words and manner of the venerable old man.  Listen to more of the blessed Teacher's words: "'Let not your heart be troubled! ye believe in God, believe also in me. "' In my Father's house are many mansions; * Chippewa for generations.   "STEN- TO- THE-END.   55 if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.  "'And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.' "Do you understand the words, my friend?" "The words are very pleasant," he respond- ed, smiling serenely, as if gazing on some pic- ture of beauty. "The place is just before me!" "I am glad you behold it," said Lindall, giving his thin, shadowy hand. a pressure of warm sympathy. "The way is sometimes clouded, even to the believer; lut, thank God, it is always light at the end." Long after the last daylight had faded, until the midnight stars were rising in the eastern sky, Paul Lindall and the old Medawe con- versed together of the spirit's home, and of its access through the blood of Christ. When the former returned to his own cabin, little Faith was sleeping the untroubled sleep of childhood, but her mother was anxiously watching and waiting. O "UL' *     XVIVLLI     VI. A THEF IN TIE NIGHT.  AIRLY the next morning, while the Lindalls were eating their simple A-dd breakfast, little Weenie came with a. basket in each hand, filled with prai- rie plums which the liunters brought home the evening before. The old clieftain- ess had sent them, one for the "White Hand" the other for Listen-to-the-end. My breakfast is done!" said Faith, spring- ing from her seat at' sight of Weenie. "Let me go with her! The good Medawe is going to tell us the story of the little hunter boy who was turned into a robin." ' You must not importune him," said her mother. "I am afraid you two children (56)   A THEF IN THE NIGHT.    57 weary him sometimes with your great thirst for stories." "No, mamma; we just sit on the mat beside him, and it is ever so nice to hear him talk.  If ever we go home I will tell our cousins the dear old man's stories, and you can show them the picture you have made of him and his wig- wam-house. Come, Weenie, I am ready." And they ran away, each holding the handle of the little basket. Weeneonka was a singular child, very shy and sensitive, caring for no one in the world, unless it were the mission child, except old Listedn-to-the-end, who shared her whole con- fidence and heart. Her adopted mother had reared her very tenderly, and would have lavished love without measure upon her now, as when her son first brought her to her wig- wam to fill the place of the little one she had lost; but from the first the' child had shrunk from her with an aversion which neither gentleness nor affection could overcome. White Cloud amused himself with her for                     .i     658   BENDING WILLOW. awhile, but finding her always cold, and some- times refractory, ceased to notice her. "The Dacotahs are all adders," he said; "they hils when you warm them in your heart. The maiden is one of them." Nor was Weenie any more popular with the children of the Lake, whom she disliked in- stinctively; and, taking no pains to conceal her repugnance, she had been equally disliked in turn, until Faith came, and led her from lodge to lodge and taught her by example the courtesy 6f a kind and gentle nature. But for the old Medawe, her love was unbounded. For him she sought the rarest blossoms in the woods, and the ripest berries on the prairies; and into his ear she poured all her secret griefs. No lonely young heart could have found a better friend or more faithful adviser. Scarcely had the Lindalls risen from. their breakfast-table, when a loud outcry from the children startled them. "O husband! It is a bear or wild-cat that has frightened them!" exclaimed Mrs. Lindall,   A THEF IN THE NIGHT.    59 in great trepidation. "It is Faith's voice! do hasten." The fleet steps of the red child were already at the door. Not a word was on her lips, but her large, dark eyqs made a mute appeal, as she pointed toward the lodge of the old medi- cine-man.        e , Papa, hurry," said Faith, who came up at the moment, much e;qited and out of breath. "Something is the matter "-and, without completing the sentence, she burst into tears in her mother's arms. "What is it, Weenie?" inquired the mis- sionary, as the child took his hand and has- tened him away in the direction of the cabin they had just left. "What has alarmed you so?" "Listen-to-the-end is silent," she replied, calmly, but with an expression that sank deeply in the heart of her questioner. "Listen-to-the-end is old, and sleeps late, perhaps," he said, soothingly. "He will not waken! The spirits came by     60      BENDING WILLOW. night and led him away. Only his empty body is now in the wigwam." Weenie's words were true. For when they reached the lodge, only the emply body of the old Medawe lay stretched out on the mat where Paul Lindall left hir sitting at mid- night. Apparently he had not moved. The same serene smile rested on his features that was there at parting; the very same far-look- ing gaze as when he said, "The place is just before me." Only the cold, rigid hand which sent such a shudder to the children's hearts a few minutes before, convinced the missionary that life had indeed departed, seemingly with- out warning, evidently without a struggle. Mrs. Lindall and Faith soon reached the cabin, and they all knelt together there beside the lifeless form, and thanked God for the ray of heavenly light whicli had penetrated the dark mists of superstition, and cheered the old man's passage to the grave. "We may regard him   as the first fruit of our. labor," Paul Lindall said to his wife,   A iTEF IN THE NHT.     61 hopefully. "I could have wished him to live a little longer, however, to aid me in turning the eyes of his people to the true God. His words were oracles to them." While the two were speaking, Weenie crouched down in a far corner of the wigwam, and sat with her large tearless eyes fixed steadily on the prostrate form she had so much loved. Something more than ordinary grief was stamped on her young face; there was a fierce, determined look that made the timid mission child tremble. "Don't feel so very bad, Weenie," Faith whispered, coaxingly. "Listen-to-the-end has gone to heaven, and will be white now, and wear a crown." "The road is very long and lonely," returned the child. "I wonder how far it is," said little Faith, musingly. "We might ask father." ' The chieftainess" (Weenie never called her mother) "has told me already. The soul camps out three nights and gets hungry     62     BENDING WILLOW. and thirsty. There are great red strawherries by the way, but the Medawe is too old to gather them. He will be very hungry and cold and weary before he reaches the river. Weenie could go with' him and light his fire and give him food." Faith did not understand these strange words, and would have asked their meaning, but her father came before she had time, and bade them go together and bring White Cloud, whose lodge was in the midst of the village. The village lay at a little distance, toward the head of the lake; but the path thither was well-worn and shaded with fragrant birches in which many birds made their nests. No one disturbed them there; not a Chippewa youth would have harmed one of the birds that picked up the Medawe's crumbs; for he had pleasant stories about them all, something good to say for every one, from gentle Opeeche * to the old black thief of the cornfields. * obin redbreast.   A TIIEF IN THE NIGHT.    63 Before the expiration of an hour, every dweller by the lake had learned of the sudden departure of their aged prophet, and the usually quiet lodge-path was thronged with men with blackened faces, and women with hair disheveled, uttering the wildest shrieks and lamentations. A file of aged warriors entered the cabin with White Cloud at their head. They paused beside the lifeless body, while their chief stooped down and took the hand of his aged friend, and placed his ear to his breast to see if the kind noble heart had indeed ceased to beat. It was the first time from his orphaned boyhood he had ever appealed to that heart in vain, and a heavy sigh escaped him. No other sound was heard for some minutes, save the wailing of the women without. Then the chief rose to his feet, and said: "Warriors, we have lost our best guide and counsellor. Listen-to-the-end never spake to us falsely. His words were the words of the wise. His eyes looked backwaird into the     "    BENDING WILLO W. past, and forward into the future. His ears heard the voices of spirits, but they never turned away from the words of men. War- riors, we shall hear the voice of our aged father no more. The Great Spirit who loved him has called him hence." White Cloud sat down, and his warriors followed his example. For more than an hour they kept silent guard beside the dead. Then a pipe was lighted and passed rapidly from hand to hand until each had smoked, when the chief and aged men retired to give place to the braves and hunters, who were all waiting to do honor to their departed friend after the manner of the Ojibwas.   -rI. TVIL THE GRAVE IN THE WILDERNESS. $S  HE missionaries were sitting together in their humble cabin that same after- noon, endeavoring, in the best way they could, to satisfy Faith's curiosity respecting the future home of the good. It was not an easy matter, for the child had many thoughts above her years; thoughts and doubts such as often creep into the minds of older persons, and which revela- tion alone can silence. "My little daughter believes the New Testa- ment?"Mr. Lindall said, at last. "Yes, papa, but I don't understand it all." "You will neveri do that, but must take a goocd deal on trust, and the tistimony of 5       (65)     "    - BENDING WILLOW. others. If your favorite St. John were living, would you doubt his words?" '"I wouldn't doubt one word he should say or write." "Turn then to his Revelations, and read tle last two chapters aloud to your mother and me." Faith was about to comply, when the figure of White Cloud appeared at the door, and entered without ceremony. "The young men are digging the grave of Listen-to-the-end," he said, "in the spot he loved. Those of his ownw totem* have pre- pared his body for burial. Three days ago White Cloud sat at his father's feet for the last time and listened to his words. He has not so soon forgotten them.  'I hear the voices of my kindred,' he said, 'and "must obey their call. Let me be buried after the manner of my people; but let the White Hand be heard at my grave. He has words of life for the Ojibwas.'" * Totem.. A rude device or picture used by the North American Indians as a symbolicfamily name.   THE GRAVE IN THE. WILDERNESS.  67, "I will be there," replied the missionary. The chief waitel to hear no more., Toward evening the whole band was as- sembled in a quiet spot not far from the lake. A new grave had been opened there. Beside it the form of the old Medawe lay upon a rude forest bier, dressed in his richest robes and ornaments. His face was painted as brightly as for a victory-dance, and his long, white hair floated like a misty veil in the breeze. There were no eagles' feathers in it, for he had never been a warrior, never in all his life taken a scalp. His face was uncovered, and looked toward the setting sun with a smile. An old man, with hair almost as white as his own, sat on the ground nearest the bier. His eyes were also fixed steadily toward the west. Paul Lindall was standing near, watching the ceremony, and wondering why it proceeded so slowly. The 'old man rose at length, and pointing with his finger toward the setting sun, said     68      BENDING WILLOW. solemnly: "Ke-wa-ku-nah!" (The road tlat leads homeward.) Every eye now turned toward the west, and the old man proceeded. "It is the road our ancestors have walked from generation to generation. The feet of Listen-to-the-end are now setting out on his long journey. He smiles, for he is not afraid of the dangers on the way. He knows the Great Eagle that sits by the roadside to counsel the soul as it passes; that Eagle is his Grandfather.* He will not turn aside for the Black Serpent that guards the river, for he wears a charm that will turn it into a log, over which his feet will walk in safety. The happy Iome of Souls lies just beyond. Brothers, it is time we let the aged Mcedawe depart. Bring him his cup and bow, that he may not hunger nor thirst by the way!" The old man sat ldown again and rested his head upon his knees, while a file of yqung men, with blackened faces, gently lifted the in-  * The Eagle was his family name, or totem.

White Cloud then took a bow and arrows and laid them reverently at his side, saying: "My father! you are going to a pleasant country, and will see the forms of your friends who have gone before you. You have been the wisest man of your tribe and nation. There is no one left to fill your vacant place. But we will not hold you back. Your feet- are weary now with the long way you have walked. You have seen two or three strizgs of lives broken and scattered. Father, it is White Cloud that gives you the bow and arrows. Heed now the words of your poor children, and draw no one after you." Then one of the warriors, who had helped place him in his grave, brought a war-club and spear, and said: "My father! though not a warrior, you may have to contend with foes .on the way. Our swift' runners say that the Blackfeet are     70     BENDING WILLOW. making many new graves. If you meet them, you will vanquish them with this charmed weapon. Miy father, it is Strong Ground who gives you his war-club and spear." Another warrior, who had a great number of eagles' feathers in his chaplet, rose and addressed the dead. "My father! when I last crossed the Great River into the land of the Dacotahs, I met two enemies, and sent them howling on the Road of Souls. One of them has gone over to my brother, who fell by my side in battle. The other is waiting to attend Listen-to-the-end, and be his slave in the Land of Spirits. My father, do not turn away from the gift of your son." As he ceased speaking, he plucked one of the feathers from his head-dress, and threw it into the grave. A youth much younger than any who had spoken came next, with a beautifully wrought tobacco-pouch and a red stone pipe, and stood by the grave, saying modestly:   THE GRAVE IN THE WILDERNESS.   71 "Grandfather! my years are few! I have won no trophies. But you taught me where to look for the choicest gifts of the Great Spirit to his children. I know the fever-balm and the cup that holds the dew to drive away madness. I offer you a new pipe, and this pouch of sweet red-willow for you to smoke on the-long road. Do not despise my gift." Then old Neenaka, who, as chieftainess, was privileged above the other women of her tribe, brought a cup and spoon, a rabbit-skin of wild rice, and a quantity of maple sugar, and deposited them on the mat at his feet without a word. Many other offerings were presented and heaped around the Medawe, until there were no more gifts to bring. Then White Cloud rose again, and said: "It was our father's wish to hear the voice of the new teacher once more before lie started on his journey." At these words Paul. Lindcall stepped for- ward until his feet pressed the verge of the gift-crowned grave, into which he looked     72     BENDING WILLOW. steadily for a moment, then raising his hands and eyes to heaven, he called on the Father of Spirits to enlighten the darkened under- standings of his listeners while he spoke to them of the true God, and of eternal life through his Son. Every eye turned toward him, and every ear was bent to listen. "Only last night," said the missionary, "I sat in the lodge of our aged, father and friend, and talked with him, and listened to his talk. His words dwelt much upon the children he had loved so long, and he wished me to repeat to them here, beside his open grave, what I have told them often before, that the red men are walking in a blind way; that the Great Spirit has given to the white men a surer revelation, which the Ojibwas would do well to listen to." Then, in the simplest words he could com- mand, he spoke to them of the Saviour of the world, who came to establish a law of peace and good-will among the nations; to teach forgiveness of injuries, love toward   THE GRAVE IN THE WILDERNESS.   73 enemies, and life and immortality beyond the grave. A few of the old warriors shrugged their shoulders and grunted dissent; but all lis- tened attentively, and the most of them were well pleased with the words of the "White Hand," which were not many, as the twilight was fast deepening into shadow.  When he sat down, the young men took a richly embroidered blanket from the hands of White Cloud, and wrapped it carefully over the features and form of the dead, while the women rent their. hair and wailed aloud. As soon as the figure was quite concealed, the chief took a clod of earth and cast it into the / grave. Every warrior and brave followed his example in turn until the grave was filled; then the women and children pressed forward to take the places of the retiring men, and raise higher the mound of Listen-to-the-end. None of the spectators watched the mourn- ful obsequies with deeper interest than the - two children, Faith and Weenie. The former     74     BENDING WILLOW. wept much; but Weenie's eyes were tearless, and looked as if burning in their sockets. She spoke only once during the ceremony, it was when the last gift was laid upon the grave. "They have not sent the Medawe empty on his journey," she said. "He has plenty of food, but no one to cook it; no one to light his fire, or mend his moccasins by the way." Faith was too much absorbed to heed the words at the moment; but she recollected them afterward, and repeated them to her parents that night as they sat grouped together in their humble home.     t .     c   VIII. THE GRAVE-LIGHT. T was nearly midnight before the sounds of lamentation were hushed beside the new-made burial mound, and the noisy females had departed for their several wigwams. Profound silence then stole over the village, and old and young slept the deep sleep that follows fatigue and excitement. None slept more soundly than Paul Lindall, though little Faith's low, incoherent murmur- ings reached the ears of her mother, who rose softly, for fear of' disturbing her weary hus- band, and sat down by the child's bed- side. There was no cause for alarm, and Mrs. Lindall, watchful and tender always, never magnified her little solicitudes into great (75)     76     BEXDIN G WYILLOE. anxieties, like too many careful mothers. Laying her hand on Faith's forehead, she found it a little warmer than usual, and the veins of the temples throbbing from nervous- ness rather than fever. A bucket of water stoodc beside the cabin door. A wet towel was one of the remedies of her simple hygiene, and one that often proved more efficacious in allaying excite- ment, than the drugs of her husband's medi- cine bag. The door swung noiselessly on its buffalo- skin hinges. Mrs. Lindall filled her bowl from the bucket, and was closing the door again, when a light from the lake side arrested her attention, just in the direction of the new-made grave. She watched it. It Iseemed only a single ray at first, but soon shot, up clearer and brighter, making the sugar-trees around distinctly visible. No form was discernible. gMrs. Lindall knew that among some of the forest tribes it is customary to light a grave-   THE GRA VE-LIGHT.     " fire, as many nights as the spirit is supposed to be on its shadowy way. This, then, was such a light, which some poor, darkened, living soul had kindled for the deadn She closed the door, wonderingwhat faithful heart was striving thus to illumine the Dark Valley, and whether their own poor labors there in the wilderness would be blessed in turning many from superstition to the true light of the gospel of the Son of God. Her husband was still sleeping, and she sat down again by her daughter's couch, bathed her forehead and temples softly, and the little hands which had grown as brown as berries in the sAn. "This is a sorry place to rear a delicate young girl," she reflected, with a sigh. "But we will do our duty by her as long as we can, then perhaps she will have to be given up like our other earthly treasures. O my child! my darling!" and the mother's arms encircled her with a pressure that broke her slumbers. "What is the matter?' she -inquired, open- J       78     BENDING WILLO W. ing her eyes and her senses, at the same time, to the fact of some unusual care. "I am not sick, am I?" "No, Faith, only a little warm and restless. You did not appear to sleep well." "No wonder, when I was dreaming such fearful dreams. I thought,--O I thought some- thing Weenie told me yesterday had come to pass." "You mustn't heed her wild stories, dear; but try to teach her what is good and true, as becomes a mission child.'- "What if she wont believe me? She says the Dacotahs are tie greatest people in the world-a thousand times braver than the Ojibwas, and wiser than any white people. She was stolen from them, you know, and remembers just a little about her own father and mother and brother. That is why she hates the lake people, who have always been so kind to her." "Poor child! But you mustn't talk any more about her to-night, dear, or it will   THE RA VE-LIGHT.     79 awaken papa, who is very tired. Try to go to sleep again, now." "Couldn't I have a drink of cold water from the bucket first?" "Certainly, you shall," and the mother went to fill her bowl afresh. There was the light again, that solemn grave-light, down by the lake; and-,yes, she could see it plainly now, a human figure hovering around and flitting before it, as if busy with some preparation. It was a little figure, no larger than Faith's. She recog- nized it even in the distance, and wondered if the child were there alone at the deep midnight, when all the village was at rest. Poor little Weenie! alone with the grave- light and the grave of her dear old friend. Not for the world would she have Faith know it. So she shut the door softly again, and returned with her bowl of water to the bedside. Faith took a good drink of it, kissed her mother, and in a few minutes was in a quiet, refreshing sleep. Then Mrs. Lin-     80     BENDING WILLO W. dall wrapped a warm shawl around her own shoulders, and stole noiselessly from the cabin, impelled by anxiety more than curiosity to know what the child could be doing there alone. She did not take the direct path, which might have exposed her approach, but one overhung with trees, and leading by the solitary lodge of the Medawe; for she wished to remain concealed while making her observa- tions. A dim half-moon was rising low down in the east, partially obscured by the mists of the autumn night. In the shelter and shadow of one of the great trees, near the mound, she sat down to look and listen. The air was full of the odor of burning rice. Weenie stood beside the fire with a little kettle in one hand, a cup and spoon in the other. She had evidently been trying her skill in cooking, and was about to lay her offering of food on the fresh mound. There were several articles of clothing spread out on the grave, but they were not the garments of       THE GRA FE-LIGHT.      81 Listen-to-the-end. Mrs. Lindall could, by the bright fire-light, clearly distinguish the blue petticoat, fringed with beads, that the old chieftainess had wrought for her adopted child, a pair of small deer-skin moccasins, and a blanket. Something else, as white as snow, lay stretched out on the blanket. It looked like Weenio's pet rabbit, the only pet she had in the world. Both children loved the roguish little fellow dearly, and the good Medawe used to fondle and caress it when it followed them to his lodge. That was the reason, perhaps, Mrs. Lindall thought, the child was sending it after her lost friend; and her tears flowed at the thought. Soon, a soft, plaintive wail broke the deep silence of the night. The child began to sing: "Pe-na-se-wug-Ne-mow-e-we-goag! Pe-na-se-wug-Ne-mow-e-we-goag!" "The birds are weeping for me! The birds are weeping for me!" Only a few days before, Faith sang that same wild strain to her mother, and told her 6     82     BENDING WILLOW. it was a death-soTh. A new idea sucddenly- took possession of Mrs. Lindall's mind, and the good woNmaln trembled with horror when the child, in a wilder tone, continued: , pe-na-se-wug-A-'Nin-gah-mow-e-we-goag!" and at the same time held up a glittering knife. She did not wait to see or hear further; but rushing from her hiding-place, before the startled creature could recover from her sur- prise, seized the knife and threw it far from her in the darkness, then caught the child in her arms and pressed her to her breast. , m"y poor Weenie!" she said, as soon as she could speak. "The good God has sent me here to save you! What were you doing, my child?"' "Going with Listen-to-the-end, to help him on his journey," she replied, calmly; though her dark eyes glittered like stars as she spoke. Mrs. Lindall stroked back her raven hair, and said very tenderly: "But what would *  sai veI   THE GRA VE-LIGHT.     83 Faith do without her dear little playmate? And what shall I do, in my school, with no one to interpret foi me?" "I don't love the Ojibwas," she returned, fiercely. "They took my father's scalp. His spirit chides me every day for becoming the child of his enemies. But I did love the good Medawe, and would have followed him safely to my father. If I stay here, shall thirst for blood! Do not keep me."  For a moment she struggled to be frde, but the firm, steady arms of the missionary held her fast. When she was quiet, Mrs. Lindall said, in a soothing tone: "Come with me now. Faith was fe erish to-night, and so are you. The day's excit ient has been too much for you both; but youi shall rest to-morrow, and I will teach you to paint a flower, or a bird with bright red wings, for Neenaka." The child was led, rather reluctantly, to the cabin of the missi6n, where a blanket was spread for her near Faith's low bed. But     84     BENDING WILLOW. Mrs. Linldall dared not sleep for fear the untamed nature would assert itself again, and steal away from them before morning. Her husband, aroused by their coming, looked very much perplexed; but, obeying a silent sign, forbore to ask questions until Weenie's heavy breathiing assured them she slept. Then the terrible tale was unfolled, and the devoted pair consulted, deliberated, and prayed for heavenly direction until the dawn of day. The conclusion in their own minds was clear, that if left to herself, the erratic child would come to harm.  Only the softening influences of education and Christianity would be likely to eradicate the native tendencies of her disposition and race. Strength was the leading feature of Weenie's character; this was never lost sight of even in her habitual reserve. Her likes and dislikes were fixed and irrever- sible. Her generosity was equalled only by her implacability. She would have given her life for a friend; at the same time, child as she was, she would have risked it in the defeat of   THE GRA VE-LIGT.     85 an enemy. The good missionaries felt how urgent was the necessity of influencing suclla nature in the right direction, and resolved to spare no effort. Faith was one of her strong attachments, as Listen-to-the-end had beei her idolatry. They determined, therefore, to make her affection for their child an instrument in the hands of God for her preservation and safety. The story of Weenie's danger and rescue- from death would have to be confided to the chieftainess and her son as soon as possible. They would do this, and at the same time beg that the child might be allowed to remain with them until her thoughts were diverted in another channel. ' 2 -     IX. SPREADING THE BLANKET IN A NEW HOME.   EFORE the children awoke in the morn- ing, Paul Lindall rose and directed his steps toward the village and the wigwam of the chief.  White Cloud was sitting outside, smoking his morn- ing pipe, when he approached. "My brother brings a message," he said, detecting, with the native sagacity of his race, an embarrassment in the usually frank, open manner of the teacher. "White Cloud is his friend." "The teacher is thfe friend of White Cloud too, and of his people," he replied, taking the chief's extended hand, "otherwise he would never have forsaken his own kindred for them.

"The little one's place is vacant this morning; her cup and spoon removed.  Dacotahs are treacherous /" He put his pipe in his mouth again, as if tile last remark were the sum of the whole story, and required no proof. "Weeniejis safe," returned the missionary. ".My wife rescued her at dead of night, and brought her to our cabin, when she was singing her death-song on the grave of the Medawe." The chief started, and his pipe was again removed from his'lips. "There was love in every heart for Listen- to-the-end," he said. "It warmed even the Dacotah. Why did not the squaw of the 'White Hand' let her die?" "Weenie is only a child, a wild, untutored child, whose feet have not yet learned the     88     BENDING WILLOW. right way. Leave her to us, and we will direct her." "The white maiden has no guile now. The Dacotah might lead her astray." That was the one unspoken fear of Mr. and Mrs. Lindall, when they first thought of bring- ing the red child in closer companioinship with their own. But they both felt it was a selfish fear, unworthy of tlose who had determined to do their duty ancl leave the event with God. Maoreover, to do Weenie justice, they had never 'discovered deceit among  her faults, and so Lindall told White Cloud, and promised, if left to them, no pains should be spared for her future good. The chief was pleased; for, whatever in- difference he might affect toward the little creature he had biought home in his arms on the long trail, there was something in his heart that plead her cause even against his own words. He knew she had been wronged, and that neither his care nor his mother's affection   THE NEW BOME.      89 could compensate for the' loss of her own kindred and family. "CWhen White Cloud found little Bending Willow * in the land of our enemies," he said, slowly and thoughtfully, "he put his heart between her and the hatchets of his warriors, and said, 'It is Nesheekca dittle sister) whom we laid to sleep in the first home of the Pil- lagers.' Then no Ojibwa, however thirsty for blood, dared molest the sister of his chief. He led her through the big woods, and took her in his arms when her feet grew weary. She was no higher than his knee, but proud and resolute then, as now. She would have died sooner than utter a complaint. White Cloud gave the little captive to his mother, to fill the Blue Bird's place in her aching heart. Neenaka loves her, but the child will not for- get she is of another race. She would walk through fire ankd death to rejoin her kindred. Weenie's spirit is good. The white teachers may bend it if they can." *Weeneonka-Bending Willow. ],     90      BENDING WILLOW. The old chieftainess was soon seen in the lodge-path, rending her hair and gesticulating wildly as she approached. Over her left arm hung the garments which her child had spread on the grave-mound to take with her on the spirit-road; and in her hands were the well- known cup and spoon, and White Cloud's scalping-knife, stained with blood. The chief fastened his eyes on the knife suspiciously. "It is the blood of her pet rabbit, which she sent before her," said the missionary. He then advanced to meet thei old woman, who began to wail aloud: "WTaubegoon! Waubegoon!" * "Come with me to the mission," he said, kindly. "Your child is there. No evil has befallen her." The poor woman uttered a cry of joy, and would have fallen, but for- the strong arm of her son, who took her up tenderly and bore her into the wigwam.

The joy of the chief- tainess was unfeigned, and her gratitule to the good woman, who had saved her from a death so fearful, sincere and unbounded. She listened attentively, and, after a brief silence, replied: "The little one's heart is very sore for the good Medawe. The white maiden's words will be balm. Let her spread her blanket for a while in the lodge of the 'White Hand.' Neenakta will gather rice in the marshes; her child's cup shall not be empty." Then, with a sad, doubtful expression, she added, interroga- tively, "The pale face has one daughter. She will not draw the heart of Bending Willow from her poor old mother?" Mrs. Lindall was touched with so much tenderness toward the unloving child, and replied that Weenie should visit her old home every day; should make moccasins for her     92     BENDING WILLO TV mother, and tell her the tales of the Great Spirit's Book.  So, in the figurative language of the Ojibwas, little Weenie's blanket was spread in a new home, a home of labor and self-denial, but, at the same time, a home of peace and content- ment.   - ---- T'   EVll HN X. THE EVIL HUNTER. ALL  that morning the two children sat together on the floor of the mission house, amusing themselves with a box of water-colors which Mrs. Lindall had drawn fron the depths of one of her capacious travelling-bags. She gave them some flowers to copy, a butterfly, and a bird, and promised to assist them as soon as she had completed her morning duties. Faith was already somewhat skilled in the use of the brushes, and had great pleasure in helping Weenie shape and color a flaunting red lily, which she chose for the first exercise of her skill. I cannot say, however, that it very much resembled a lily, when Faith called (93,     "    BENDING WILLOW. her mother to see what a gorgeous flower they had made. The central organ looked a good deal like a savage war-club; the six yellow anthers were lopping in various directions, some of them with broken backs, while the flaming petals were spotted as grotesquely as a young Indian's face for a victory-dance. And yet Mrs. Lindall praised it, and told them to try a butterfly next; for she saw the deep shadows on Weenie's face were fading away with the pleasant exercise. When Mr. Lindall came and found them thus employed, he extolled their work .in even stronger terms than his wife had done; and itold them, now Weenie was going to remain with them, they must cover the rough walls of their room all over with pictures, and paint some for Neenaka too, who had so kindly consented to her stay with them. That was the first intimption the children had of the arrangement,' and botl were' delighted; for children invariably love the companion- ship of children, though differing ever so   THE EVIL HUNTER.     95 widely in race or rank. They are young "levellers," and natural gifts decide the leadership among them, quite unlike the accidents that determine the dignity of men and women. Many pleasant days succeeded this first one at the 'mission; days in which labor and recreation were so harmoniously blended that the children never wearied of either. Both had their daily lessons, their daily walks to the village to visit old Neenaka, and a frequent paddle on the lake in a beautiful bark canoe, the gift of White Cloud. Weenie called it "The Wild Goose," and could make it skim over the waters like a bird. Even Faith, though very timid at first, soon learned to paddle skillfully, to the great delight of the old chieftainess, who would sit on the sands and watch them with childish pleasure from hour to hour. Mr. Lindall, meanwhile, was struggling with the many difficulties of an unlettered language; making what. he felt to be slow     96.    BENDING WILLOW. progress in rendering the words of the New Testament in signs and figures of speech, which his listeners could comprehend. He had not attempted this in order, but only such detached chapters and passages as he thought best suited to their necessities. While Listen-to-the-end lived, his Sabbath mornings were usually spent under the maple-trees that shaded his lodge, talking with the old man who was never weary of the words of the new teacher. Sometimes the whole band would gather there, impelled by curiosity to hear words which their wise Medawe had pronounced "good." But since their aged friend's departure, the lodge-path and lodge were alike deserted. The cool autumnal morn- ings no longer favored such gatherings in the open air. The mission-house was very small and crowded; and Mr. Lindall at length pro- posed to White Cloud that the empt)y lodge of their old prophet slould be transformed into a chapel, where his people might gather, to listen to the words of life.   TEE EVIL BUNTER.     97 The suggestion pleased the chief, who rev- erenced everything associated with his de- parted friend. He sent his young men to the aid of the missionary, and the old cabin was soon transformed into a comfortable chapel, very convenient for either church or school. It was there Mrs. Lindall first gathered the little ones of the tribe, as she had contem- plated, and, with the aid of Faith and Weenie, began a course of systematic instruction. Both children were quick of apprehension, and understood one another thoroughly, and English and Ojibwa ran from Atongue to tongue in the little mission school, to the great delight of all. It was amusing to see the old men and women stand at the door, watching and listening to the children's exercises, silent as though bound by some spell of enchantment. The old lodge was not without its influence, and the Medawe's spirit seemed to linger around the place long after his venerable form had departed. No Indian mission was ever planted under 7     98      BENDING WILLO W. more favorable auspices, or gave promise of fairer results. Mr. and Mrs. Lindall felt this, and thanked God daily for directing them thither, where the wilderness soil seemed broken and ready for the heavenly seed. Home, with its sweet pleasures and refine- ments, was left behind; losses and crosses were accepted in its place; but even the toils and privations of that first long winter in the forest awoke no sorrowful regrets or longings in their heroic hearts. They were volunteers for Christ, and expected the discipline with the duty, and shrank from neither. The glory of God, and the good of their fellow-men was their cause, the noblest cause in which men have ever enlisted. For it they were ready to endure all things. One hour of every evening Mr. Lindall devoted to Faith's lessons, an hour of rest and recreation after his more trying study and labor. Her mornings were spent in the school- room with her mother, where her services were invaluable; but she found little time for study   THE EVIL HUNTER.      99 there, with more than twenty young Ojibwas lisping the alphabet, or repeating hymns in chorus, or drawing cabalistic characters, sig- nificatl to them of beast, bird or insect. It was no place for Latin declensions, or Parley's History, or Colburn's Mathematics, which her father insisted on teaching her; though only the history quite suited her lively fancy. Anything containing story or narrative was her especial delight; but such things were rare in the wilderness. Her father's library consisted of a single shelf of books, most of them quite beyond her years and comprehension. Only  one volume she appropriated entirely; it was the story of thalt wonderful "Pilgrim," whose "Progress " has so long been followed by the tears and smiles of both infancy and age. This book suited Faith exactly, and was the constant companion of her leisure hours. Sometimes it found a place beneath her pillow, and her father and mother often overheard her simple explanations of the narrative to Weenie., who always asserted it was not a whit better \ / .I     100    BENDING WILLOW. than the tales of Nan-up-ash-o, and not half as good as the story of old Ge-tu-be. They were especially .amused one morning when Faith attempted to tell her the meaning of the picture of "Christian and Faithful asleep in the grounds of Giant Despair." "What you call Giant, is old JMj-a-cee-wzis," she said, positively. "Don't you see war-club in his hand, and big. scalp-lock braided on top of his head? He is one very great boaster. Weenie knows all about Muj-a-kee-wis and his nine brothers, whom Evil Hunter destroyed. -You know Evil Hunter, don't you?" "No," replied Faith. "Tell me about him, wont you?" "Evil Hunter dwelt in the middle of a great frozen lake, alone with his little dog, who was wicked as his bad master. They used to feast on hunters and trappers who crossed the lake, if they stopped a single moment to rest or smoke. When they went straight forward Evil Hunter had no power to charm them.   THE EVTL HUNTER.     101 "An old woman lived in a lodge on the border of the lake on purpose to warn travellers of their danger; but foolish young men would not listen to words of old woman. They did not know she was daughter of the Great Spirit. "One winter, the ten sons of old Ge-tu-be went, one after another, to the lake, and were all destroyed by this wicked hunter. Then their father, very angry, set out to revenge their death. But before venturing on the dangerous lake, he sat down, as he was counselled, to eat .and smoke until he was satisfied. The hunter did not like this at all, so he ran toward him, and began to set his savage little dog on the quiet old man, who did not mind either of them. "'What are you doing here, old man?' Evil Hunter said at last. "Getube said nothing. Evil Hunter thought he had lost his hearing, and said louder than before: "' What are you doing here on the border of my lake?'     102    BENDING WILLOW. "Old man kept on smoking and never an- swered a word, though little dog continued to growl and snarl, and the hunter to taunt him. After a while Evil Hunter turned to look be- hind him; then Ge-tu-be sprang up and seized him by the back of the neck and threw him up to the sky, where he stuck fast, and his bow became the new moon. "The dog continued to yell until Getube gave him a great blow too, and sent him howling after his master.. Weenie sees the hunter's bow often, and sometimes Evil Hunter's face looking through it at his little dog, who still follows his master in the sky."   X I. xi. PASSOVER-FLOWERS. PRING is every where welcome with her robe of verdure, her voice of music, and her breath of flowers. Her praise is much in the mouths of little children and of poets, those children of nature that never grow old. I doubt whether, since the Pilgrims of New England gathered their first May-flowers in the sandy woods of Ply- mouth, the advent of spring has ever been more cordially welcomed than by our solitary mission family by the shores of Silver Lake. Not that they had suffered for food, or from sickness, like their worthy forefathers, for game and fish had been unusually abundant, and the new teacher's table was never left (103)     104     BENDING WILLO W. empty.  Moreover, the simple viands and bracing air of the Northwest were imparting fibre to the delicate frame of the scholar, and roses to the cheeks of his child. Mrs, Lindall, who had always been blessed with a "sound mind in a sound body," retained them with her customary cheerfulness and patient sweet-  ness. But the winter had been long and severely cold. Great snows had drifted over the prairies and blocked up the familiar paths. The red hunters went abroad on snow-shoes, and Mr. Lindall was obliged to adopt them also, greatly to the amusement of Faith, who had never seen such things before. The Ojibwas' snow-shoes are of very simple construction. Long stripP of elastic wood bent until the two ends nearly meet compose the frames, which are confined with cords or thongs. The forward part is shaped some- thing like a lemon, or an elongated sphere. A network is formed for the foot to rest upon, by interlacing strips of skins from side to side.   PASAdVER-FLO WERS.    105 These, bound firmly to, the feet and ancles, Cover a larger space of snow than the weight of the body can possibly press down; conse- quently the wearer will walk, without sinking, over piles which might otherwise quite engulf him. These useful articles were not worn by the men alone. Women and children might be seen waddling over the white depths, their great snow-shoes presenting a singular con- trast to their own small moccasined feet.' Faith called them all web-footed, and laughed at their odd gait, while envying them their novel means of locomotion. Their cabin was dark and dull to her in winter. She would gladly have been chasing Weenie over the beautiful fields of snow. After a while her wish was gratified. The old chieftainess came one day with three pairs of light, handsome snow-shoes, for her mother, herself, and Weenie, which she had constructed with great care from the choicest material she * The Ojibwa women are remarkable for small feet.     106     BENDINa WILLO W. could obtain. The children's delight as they bound them upon their feet was a sufficient recompense to her. Weenie had worn such things before; and glided away over the snow heaps like a bird; but Faith was awkward at first, and went pitching, this way and that, like a tipsy sailor. It was good exercise, however, as well as most excellent sport; and before many days, she could run with the fleetest, and shout with the merriest. Neenaka no longer missed their daily visits, and Mr. Lindall sometimes al- lowed them to accompany him out on the lake where the ice was cut, and the Indians were baiting and spearing white-fish. The school had to be discontinued on ac- count of the excessive cold, but the home lessons were not interrupted, and both children made commendable progress; Weenie in her spelling-book, Faith in Latin grammar, history and arithmetic. Both painted gay pictures, many of which found their way to the lodge of the chieftainess, who made mittens of the   PASSO VER-FLO WERS.    107 white reindeer-skin and pretty moccasins for them in return. Mrs. Lindall seldom went abroad except to visit the sick in the village. These always found in hqr a ready nurse and kind comforter. Many poor, fevered heads, driven almost to madness by the. noisy incantations of the old doctresses, had been soothed by the gentle touch of the "mission woman'ss" hand, or relieved of pain by her simple prescriptions. The dark cheerless wigwam was never too dark for her presence; the cold winter night never too long or dreary for the faithful watcher, whose footsteps followed her Master's among the lowly, and in paths of self-denial. No wonder her face grew transparent, though not with illness. It was refined by heavenly charity until the woman's spirit within shone through like an angel's. The winter was long to her, nevertheless; for in her warm humane heart were some cherished earthly memories, that would dwell there amid its heavenly affections until the     108     BEVNDING WILLOWT end. She had a father and mother, brothers, and a sister, whom she had forsaken, but not forgotten. Before the deep snows of winter blocked up the long trail, she used to hear from them occasionally. Twice had the kind officers at Snelling forwarded communications to the mission by a special courier, and once the Ojibwa hunters had brought letters and news- papers that linked them with the far-off world. With the first supply-boat to the fort, mes- sages would come to them again from home; articles of comfort and necessity also. Was it surprising' then they should wait longingly, and welcome the first foot-prints of the spring? They were visible at last; and with them, came one of the Medawe's blue-birds, and sang in the sugar trees above his lodge. But there was no old man there to welcome it with crumbs as usual, so it came and perched tamely on the open door of. the mission cabin, peering in, with its bright eyes, and head turned one side, as if to listen as well as look. "There is old Mother Wassa!" said Weenie,   PASSOVER-FLOWERS.      109 making a sign with her finger not to frighten the bird. "I remember every feather of her, and the little notch in her tail the good Me- dawe cut. She has come here to ask for her friend." Then in a kind of wild recitative she ad- dressed the blue-bird, swaying her body in time as she sang: "Wassa, Owassa, lie has gone away from us I Did you not see him where the birds go in winter? Wassa, Owassa, Inow will take care of you! Build a soft nest in the hole of a tree! No one shall harm you! No one shall harm you!" Not a word was spoken while the strange red phild sang her rude welcome to the bird. Mrs. Lindall and Faith watched the lights and shadows playing over the features of the little improvvisatrice in mute wonder. The wild song did not cease until their welcome visitor flew away. Then Weenie jumped up suddenly, letting fall the dull spelling-book as she said: "There are blossoms by the lake, colored     "O    BENDzING WILLOW. like Owassa's wings. She always brings them with her!" "No," rejoined Mrs. Lindall. "The snow is everywhere yet. The flowers have not found a place to start." "The blue-bird brings them," she per- sisted. "The Medawe showed me the hollow where they may be found." There is no use in arguing with the enthusi- asm of youth. Faith's Latin grammar lay on the floor beside Weenie's spelling-book, and the two, comfortably hooded and blanketed, started at once for the sunny hollow by the lake. It was half a mile away, through a wood-path perfectly familiar to Weenie. The sun was shining warmly, and the air was filled with a soft red mist. The melting snow trickled in little rivulets toward the lake, leaving green patches of earth visible here and there as they went. Another blue- bird was heard in the wood, and several chipping sparrows hopped in the path before them as happy as themselves. Weenie did   PASSO VLR-FiLOWERS. .   1" not sing to them, nor pause for a moment until she reached a green dell, sloping south- ward, where the snow was all wasted. "They are here!" she said, with her usual positiveness, though Faith saw no indications of flowers. Her eyes were not as sharp as an Indian girl's. It was not many minutes before Weenie's discovery made true her assertion. Tufts of large, brilliant blossoms, with silken stems, reminded Faith of the liverworts she had loved ever since she could remember. But these were not liverworts. They were very much larger and more downy. She had never seen any flowers like them before. They gathered all they could find, and hastened back to the mission with their treasures. Mr. Lindall met them at the door, and told them they had found the first "Pass- over-flowers," the blue anemones of the prairie. "We have found something besides flowers," *Anemone pulsafilla, or Pasque-flower.     "2    BENXDING WILLOW. said Faith, "and I have it here in my apron. 'Tis a little blind mouse. Weenie pulled it out of a hole at the root of a tree, and told me the funniest story in the world about it. I will tell it to you and mamma, and then I know you will let me keep the poor little thing and take care of it. Listen now, and you shall hear how Pet's old grandmother lost her eyes. HOW THE DORMOUSE BECAME BLIND. "When the old earth was new, some of the animals were as large as mountains, and very fierce and savage. They killed off all the people in the world except one young girl and her brother, who were hid by their parents in a cave in the forest. "The little boy was a dwarf, not as high as a man's knee; and though his sister took great pains to provide him plenty of food, he would never grow any larger. "His sister was always afraid to leave him alone for fear some great bird might find him,   PASSO VER-FLO WERS.   113 and fly away with him. She took him wifth her whenever she went to collect wood for their fire, or in quest of something to eat, "One day, when he was older, she made him a bow and arrows, and said to him: 'You must learn to shoot birds! You see these logs I have been piling up here? By-and-by the little snow-birds will come to pick the worms out of them. Hide away until you see them, then shoot one of them and bring it home. I will go now and prepare dinner.' "The little fellow waited as she bade him, and. when the birds came, he fired several arrows at them without success, then followed his sister to their dwelling. She told him he must not be discouraged at one failure, but try again the next day. "The next morning she took him out again, and after cutting down much wood with her hatchet, she left him with the same injunction as before. Toward night she heard his little footsteps cracking the frozen snow, and went 8     "4     BENDING WILL OW. to the door to meet him. He had never been so long from her before. "See,' he exclaimed, with an air of triumph, 'I have killed a bird! I wish you to skin it tfor me, and stretch the skin; and when I have killed more, I will have a coat made, of them.' "'And what wiu we do with the body?' she asked, for they never remembered tasting game of any sort. "'Cut it in two,' he replied, 'and put it in our pottage, half at a time. I intend to become a great hunter hereafter.' "She did as he directed, and they both relished the flavor of the bird very much. "Every day now the little boy went out with his sister, and tarried behind her until he had shot his snow-bird. When he had killed ten, his sister made him a coat, a very pretty coat it was too, fitting him exactly; but so small, one of the bird-skins was not needed for it. The little pigmy was exceedingly proud of it, and used to go parading up and down   PASSOVER-FLOWERS.     115 the lodge-path, feeling quite important, and thinking himself the biggest man in the world. And so he was, because there was not another. "One day, after strutting around for a long time, he returned to his sister. "'Tell me,' he said, 'if this great big earth and high blue sky were made only for a girl and a boy like you and me? Are there not more people living somewhere?' "She told him the earth was once full of their kindred, but the wicked animals had destroyed them all; and that if ever he went near the quarter of the world where they dwelt, they would make only a mouthful of a little fellow like him. "This only excited the boy's curiosity, and he lay awake that night thinking about the great monsters, and how he could destroy theml. And when his sister left him alone the next day, instead of waiting to shoot a bird for their dinner, he said, 'This is small game! I will go and avenge our kindred!'     "6    BENDING WILLOW. "So he took his bow and arrows and marched away toward the open piairie. "After walking a long time, and meeting no living creature, he grew tired and sleepy. "Corning to a hillside where the spring sun had melted away the snow, he lay down and was soon fast asleep. "By-and-by, he felt something pinching him tightly. Before he was fairly awake, he thought one of the great animals had hold of him. But it was not so. While he slept, the sun had been beating down upon him so fiercely that his pretty bird-skin coat was not only singed, but so shriveled up he could scarcely breathe in it. As soon as he compre- hended the mischief, he flew into a towering rage, and abused the sun in very strong language for a boy no more than a foot and a half high. "' Do not think you are out of my reach,' said he. 'I know a trick or two, and you will yet be sorry for burning up my new coat.'   PASSOE R-FLOWERS.    117 "Never was a little fellow so angry before. When he went home, he would not taste so much as a hazelnut; he did nothing but re- proach the sun, and mourn for his beautiful bird-skin garment. His sister tried to com- fort him, and promised him another coat as soon as he would shoot the birds. But he lay down angrily, and, for ten days, never spoke a word, nor moved an inch. Then he turned over and lay ten days longer on the other side, in spite of all his sister's tears and en- treaties. "As you may suppose, he was very pale and weak when lie got up, but not a whit less angry than when he lay down. He told his sister he was determined to catch the sun the very first thing he did, and she must make him a net or snare. "The poor girl did not know what to do. She cast around her, and at last found a deer's sinew among some of her father's relics. This she tied in a slip-knot, or noose, and showed him. He said it would not do at all;     "8    /JBENDI2G WILiOW. and straightway began to scold his sister as severely as he had berated the sun. "She looked again, and could find nothing except the little snow-bird's skin which was left when she made the coat. This she cut very carefully into a cord and presented him; but the sight of it made him more furious than ever. "'The sun has had quite enough of my bird- skins,' he said; 'you must find me some- thing else.' "The poor girl went out of the lodge, weep- ing as though her heart would break, at her brother's absurdity. While wiping her eyes on her long, dark hair, it occurred to her it would make a beautiful coil. So she sat down and began to pull it out and twist it until she had a cord, glossy and black as jet. "When her brother saw it, he was delighted and exclaimed. 'Oh, that will do! That will do! I will now have the sun before to- morrow, or he may burn me up!' "He ate his supper in better temper, and,   PASSO VVER-FLO WERS.   119 about midnight, wound the glossy coil around his neck and left the lodge, vowing to catch the old fellow before he rose. He knew he would strike the eastern hill-top before he  came up; so he ran as fast as ever he could go, and fixed his snare there firmly, then hid himself to watch the event. "The sun had no suspicion of what the dwarf had done. He had probably quite forgotten the threats of his little enemy, or, if he remem- bered them, it was only to smile at the little fellow's spirit. But when he touched the hill- top, he found himself suddenly entangled in a hairy mesh and unable to rise. The dwarf saw his struggles, and clapped his hands in great glee at the success of his stratagem. "But the animals that dwelt on the earth were not so well blessed. They had no light, and ran this way and that to inquire what had happened. No one seemed to know, and a council was summoned without delay. A wise dormouse gave it as her opinion that some evil spirit had caught the sun in a snare,     120     BENDING WILELOW. and moved that some one be appointed to go and cut the cord. "The motion was objected to on the ground that the sun would be sure to burn up any creature that approached it. "At last, finding no one willing to accept the hazardous undertaking, the dormouse volun- teered to go herself. She was then the largest animal in the world, larger than the largest buffalo. She set out without loss of time for the hilltop on which the sun lay ensnared. As she drew near, her back began to smoke and shrivel up, but she would not turn back. Before reaching it heaps of ashes fell from her body on every side, but she succeeded in gnawing the net with her teeth until'the sun was free, and rose up over the hilltops as bright and round as ever. The animals saw it and rejoiced, though they believed their brave dormouse had perished. But many days after a poor little blind thing crept into their midst, a creature no larger than the smallest squirrel. No one of them recog-   PASSO VER-FLOWERS.    121 nized her, or believed her the deliverer of the sun. But from that time to this, the dor- mouse las been blind, and from the largest, has become the smallest of all quadrupeds."     XII. THE DAOOTAHS' VENGEANCE. 9HE   transition from winter to spring is magical in the far Northwest. While the rivers and lakes are still locked with ice, young leaves are bursting and flowers springing everywhere, like Jonah's gourd in a single night. In a week after the children's discovery, the prairies were purple with anemones, the woods scarlet with maple-bloom, and the lake-side fringed with the hairy tassels of the osier, or basket willow. Intermingled with these, were snowy aronias, and blossoms of the wild plum. Nature is no niggard. She scatters lavishly everywhere; but those who (122)   THE  A ACOTAHS' VENaGEACNO. 123 enter her secrt places are sure to be rewarded with her choicest gifts. The Ojibwa village was soon wide awake with the influences of the spring.  The hunters and trappers were bringing in their winter harvesti of buffalo-meat, furs, and skins, and the sugar-makers were ready for their forest encampment. There is no gayer season in the whole year than the season of sugar-making. The women and boys of the tribe repair to the maple- woods, set up their tepees, and, while the trees are yielding liquid sweetness, play ball, dance, and make merry day and night. The aged men seldom go thither, for the frolics of the camp are not deemed in keeping with the wisdom. and gravity of counsellors. But the old women are always there to preserve order, attend to the boiling of the sap, and keep the frolicsome young people from excess of folly. Neenaka was one of the first to send her tepee to the forest. She had not missed the encampment for half a century, and no one's     124     BENDING WILLOW. sugar was accounted as good as hers. She always took Weenie with her now, and for two or three years the child's ingenuity had been of essential service to her, in construct- ing vessels for the reception of the sugar out of the bark of the canoe birch. It was a sunny April morning when the sugar-makers set out for their camping-place, ten miles from the lake, on the borders of a beautiful creek. A few of the very old women went on horses as lean and dilapidated as themselves, while the younger ones bore the tepees, blankets, and a few simple cooking utensils. The young men and boys had only their bows and arrows, their fish-spears and dogs; for they were to be "big Indians" some day, and would not demean themselves with burdens. Beshike, Neenaka's little shaggy pony, so well known at the mission house, was the first object that greeted the children's eyes that morni'ig. Its mistress had come to see whether the red child would like to follow the   THE DACOTAHS' VENGEANCE.   125 sugar-makers. The temptation was too strong to be resisted, especially when encouraged by her friends. "Go by all means, Weenie," said Mrs. Lindall, who perceived the desire of the chief- tainess for her company. "Go, and fill your cup with maple-honey when you return. We can have no school until the children come back from the camp." The child was off like an arrow. Faith stood at the door and watched her, following at the heels of the brown pony, until a sharp angle in the path hid her from sight. t Then I am not certain but, just for a moment, she too would gladly have followed the sugar- makers. That was a busy day at the mission. Another party was going from the lake village the next morning to the fort, a' party of hunters with their winter furs. Mr. and Mrs. Lindall were booth delighted and thankful for the opportunity thus presented to send letters and messages, and spent nearly the whole \     126     BENDING T ILLO W. day writing to absent friends, or giving orders for articles deemed indispensable to future comfort and usefulness. Mrs. Lindall proposed that her husband should accompany the hunters, but the thought of separation from his wife and child, and the possibility of sickness or acci- dent during his absence, deterred him. It was no distrust, or lack of confidence in his red brethren or their brave chief, who pro- mised to watch over and guard the wigwam of the "White Hand" from every foe. The missionary had reason to rejoice at his decision, when, ten days after, the fleetest youth from the sugar-camp came rushing into the village one morning, at break of day, with the cry of "Dacotahs!" It was a sound to arouse every warrior of the tribe. White Cloud seized his toma- hawk and scalping-knife, and repaired imme- diately to the open square, which a dozen veteran warriors had reached before him, and as many more soon after. The old counsellors   THE DACOTAHS' VENGEANCE.   127 were not long behind, and the frightened boys underwent a strict examination as to the cause of alarm. Their story was soon told. The evening before, while the women were boiling the maple-juice, and the young people dancing by the light of the moon, shrieks were heard from the edge of the encampment. Three grimly-painted wairiors had rushed suddenly from their concealment among the maple- trees, and seizing an old woman, scalped her before their eyes, and as quickly disappeared. It was the wife of Black Adder, one of the oldest warriors of their band. All" was then confusion in the camp, mothers and, children flying wildly in every direction seeking one another, while the young men sought their weapons, and put themselves at once on guard. Only two of the fleetest were dispatched to alarm the village and arouse the warriors. The listeners waited to hear no more. Without loss of time, White Cloud, with twenty of his bravest and trustiest men, Black Adder     128     BENDING WILLOW. among them, took the trail to the sugar-camp, leaving only the mission family and a few decrepit old persons behind in the village. Before noon, however, stragglers began to come in from the encampment, each with a tale of horror surpassing the first. It was now ascertained that two women had been scalped, and two children were missing, one of them the young Dacotah, Neenaka's adopted child. For many years the Dacotahs had not ventured into the country of White Cloud, whose name had inspired them with terror ever since his destruction of one of their vil- lages in avenging the massacre of his father. But rumor tells tales even in the forest. She whispered to his enemies that their great foe- the son of Black Cloud, had welcomed a pale- face to his country, and forsaken the war-trail. Now was the time for them to avenge the death of Chasca, the father of Bending Willow, who was torn from her mother's arms by the hands of the Black Adder.  His brother, Wahtoga, listened to the pleasing suggestion,   THE DACOTAHS' VENGEANCE.   129 and, with three men as daring as himself,.set out for the Lake of the Great Spirit. They came accidentally upon the encampment where the mother of White Cloud and the wife of Black Adder, unconscious of danger, were in- structing the younger women in the art of sugar-making. The scalp of the latter was soon taken, and that of another old woman, but not the chieftainess. In the maple-wood, a little outside of the camping-place, was a spring of pure water, with a shallow outlet flowing into the creek below. In both the spring and outlet, crisp, green water-cresses grew in abundance. Weenie was very fond of them, and when- ever she went for water, brought them in tangled masses as a relish for their simple meals. That afternoon she went as usual to the spring and did not return. Neenaka, thinking she had mingled with the ball-players and forgotten her supper, ate her own wild rice, seasoned with maple-honey, and returned to 9     130     BENDING WILLOW. her work. The twilight faded into evening. She heard the Indian youth playing their reed- flutes, and making music with rattles, while the merry shouts of the dancers echoed far and wide. It was very natural, she thought, that a young girl like Weenie should prefer the lively young people to the lonely tepee, and the company of an old woman, though she could never be persuaded to join them before. She little suspected, what was detaining her; for, until that first fearful shriek rent the air, she had felt not a shadow of anxiety for her safety; but was rather pleased that the haughty child should be attracted from her solitary broodings to the merry-makers. But Weenie had not been with the merry- makers. On her way to the spring, a wounded rabbit crossed her path, and she determined to capture it for Faith, who loved pets dearly. It limped away. into tl'e thicket, pursued by the persevering child, who was just laying her hands upon it, when a stalwart figure, grimly painted and feathered, stood   THE DACOTAHS' VENGEANCE.    131 before her. Weenie was startled for a mo- ment, but not afraid. A single glance at his head-dress and paint told her he was not an Ojibwa. Another glance at his straight moc- casins assured her he was a Dacotah.  A keen-eyed Indian will readily distinguish a stranger by the form of his moccasin, ho two nations wearing them exactly alike. That of the Ojibwas, pztckered on the top of the foot, gives name to the tribe; Ojibwa meaning puckered. For nearly eight long years the little cap- tive had dreamed of Dacotah warriors, such as her father used to lead, and longed to see them once more. Now  one was standing before her, eyeing her sternly, and she gave him back gaze for gaze. The red stranger was astonished at so much coolness and audacity. "Why don't the little one run away?" he demanded, in words strange to her ear, yet not quite forgotten. "Dacotals never run," she replied, boldly. "Weeneonka is a Dacotah, and not afraid."     132     BENDING WILLOW. Indian children in danger are often ex- ceedingly cunning. Her listener was aware of this fact, and thought the child well practised in artifice. He would put her words to the test. "The little maiden is wise and no coward," he rejoined. "Her words are the words of the brave. She shall go to her people, to the lodge of Wahtoga. Butl first she must guide him into the camp of his enemy, and to the Lake of the Great Spirit." The look of joy which overspread Weenie's face at first darkened into a frown with these last words, and she replied, resolutely: "The stranger says true! Bending Willow is no coward. But Ojibwas are her friends, and- she will die sooner than betray them. She is not afraid of death." The strange warrior gazed in astonishment. into'the flashing eyes that never quailed before his piercing glance. "Tuh-wuh!' -said he. "What foolish maiden is this that dares speak thus to Wahtoga, brother of murdered Chasca, the bravest of his band?"   THE DACOTAMS' VENGEANCE.   133 "It is Chatsca's child," she returned, not a ,muscle quivering, or a tear starting. "She will follow the Dacotah to her old home with a glad heart, but he shall never touch a hair of Wllite Cloud, or of the old chieftainess, her adopted mother. His war-whoop shall not be heard by the Lake of the Great Spirit, to startle the White Hand or the Christ-woman and her pretty fawn. The mound of Listen- to-the-end is there; the shouts of Weeneonka's kindred shall not rise above it. There are other Ojibwas to fight! Let the L^ke people live in peace with their new teacher, who tells them to forgive their enemies." "It is the child of murdered Chasca who speaks to ler happy uncle," the' Dacotah said, slowly and thoughtfully. "He reads in her father's face that she will make her words good! Wahtoga will go home without scalps, bearing his brother's little one whom the fierce Adder tore from her mother's- arms. He will go to-night 'lest his thirst -for blood should return and overcome the softness of his heart." (,     134     BENDING WILLOW. But his followers were not so easily pacified. Each of the three had some private wrong to retaliate, and it is not an Indian's nature to retire from the presence of a foe .with clean hands. "Wahtoga has found a daughter and is glad," they said, in deepest gutturals. "His warriors may go home empty.   They are not dogs to do it. He leads on the homeward trail when the red star rises, and the night- sun l' shines. It is good! . There are two hours yet for vengeance." They lay down again on the ground, nursing their wrath with sullen mutterings and silent resolves, while they watphed the progress of the evening. When the moon came up full and round, and the merry shouts of the dancers were heard in the distance, one by one they stole away to satisfy their thirst for blood. It. was then those deadly shrieks resounded through the camp of the Ojibwas, and the young men grasped their weapons. * The moon.

XIII. LAKEVILLE. FAITH shed many tears for the loss of her playmate, brave little Weenie, whose dauntless spirit had so often in'- spired her own more timid nature with strength and courage. Who would lead the way through the shadowy wood- paths now, to the hollows where the rarest flowers sprang, and the earliest strawherries reddened? Or who would send the "Wild- Goose " over the lake with the fleetness of a bird, or lead Beshike by the mane to the steps of the mission house, where the two had often mounted his broad back for a ride? Faith could do nothing without her com- (136)   "AKEVILLA.      137 panion; she felt afraid of her own. shadow now. Her father endeavored to moderate her grief by suggesting the possibility of White Cloud's party overtaking the Dacotahs, and bringing back the children unharmed. But Faith knew better. She knew perfectly well that Weenie preferred her own nation to the Ojibwas, and would never be brought back alive; and much as she missed her, she secretly hoped she would not be'recaptured. Poor old Neenaka came from the encamp- ment bowed down, and broken-hearted. Her face was painted in long black stripes in token of mourning, for she believed her foster- child had been massacred, and wailed un- ceasingly, "Waubegoon! Waubegoon!"Faith vent to her lodge and tried to comfort her, but the sight of her child's coapanion only increased her grief. It was two days before White Cloud and his warriors. returned. They had been unable to obtain the slightest trace of the fugitives.     138    BENDING WILLOW. With the faintest indication of their trail, they would have pursued them to the very borders of the enemy's country, but discover- ing none, the chief feared they might be lurking somewhere in the neighborhood of the lake, waiting to surprise the Ojibwa village, which was guarded only by a few old men and boys. But night after night the village slept in peace, for the Dacotahs with their two cap- tives were far away by the springs of the Upper Minnesota, rapidly approaching their home at Big Stone Lake. Until the return of the hunters from Fort Snelling, little was thought of or talked of but the disastrous incursion of the enemy. Every evening the council-fire was lighted to deliberate on the expediency of sending a war-party into the territory of the Dacotahs; but the old men were divided in sentiment. The lessons of the new teacher had sunk into the hearts of some, moderating their resent- ments, and producing the fruits of peace, if t5   "AKEVILLE.      139 not of love. And now Mr. Lindall labored more earnestly than ever before to impress on theirminds the moral sublimity of forgiveness of injuries, and to show them how much more of cowardice than true courage marked the Indian mode of warfare. The example of their foe, lurkling by day, 'and waiting for night to attack a harmless company of women and children, was cited with much effect, so ready is human nature everywhere, savage or civilized, to judge others by a law which would condemn itself. Never had the Ojibwa counsellors been so undecided before; and the war faction, with Black Adder as leader, was too small to awaken much enthusiasm, or to promise success on the trail. The return of the hunters at this time from the fort with a fresh excitement diverted the savage mind from the war-path, and the expedition was finally abandoned. This new excitement was nothing less than the advent of another pale-face into the country; one of a class of pioneers, whose energy and center-     "O     BENDING WILL TW. prise have done more to open the gates of the wilderness than all other causes combined. From the earliest history of the country, the Indian trader has led the van of civilization, and has done more to preserve peace on the border than our whole cordon of government forts. Some of these have been men of distinguished ability, who have written their names indelibly in the history of the land. We cannot say they have all been good or. noble; but as a whole, they have rendered their country essential service. The Ojibwa hunters were much prouder of their second companioA than they had been of the first, whose object and office they did not quite comprehend; neither were they certain what reception would be awarded him from their chief and people. But for some time they had been ambitious of a trader like their brethren of Crow Wing, and the Great Lakles; and the shout which they sent up as they drew near their village was full of exultation. Every one who heard it knew the hunters were '   "AKEVILLE.      141 returning unharmed, and with good news, so accurate is the savage ear in distinguishing the different expressions of the human voice. There was a grand sally at once to meet the returning- party, and learn what tidings they brought from " the big guns." White Cloud was among the foremost, and the good mis- sionary was too impatient to linger behind; for the shout of these Ojibwa hunters wavs like the whistle of the first steamer that breaks the winter's barriers on its way to the frontier town; or like-the dust of the caravan, which has traversed long sandy deserts, and comes laden with treasures from afar. Ir. Lindall was called upon to interpret the words of the stranger; and after a brief parley, the chief extended to him a welcome, and led the way to tie centre of the village, where he was allowed to set up his tent and deposit his merchandise, as mucll as two of the hunters' pack-horses had been able to bring. The eyes of the unaccustomed Lake people were fairly dazzled with the gay calicoes, scarlet and blue     "2     BENDING WILLOW. flannel, snowy blankets, clay-pipes,' knives, hatchets, bright beads, cooking and agricul- tural utensils, and the various other things which constitute the stock of an Indian trader. They had never seen anything like it before. The name of the new trader was James West. He was a young man fresh from the granite hills and district-schools of northern New Hampshire. By a tallow candle in his father's kitchen, he had read the history of the great men of the times, and learned that many of the number had been frontiersmen, and risen to noble heights from the school of nature. - He waited impatiently until he was twenty-one; then, with a few hundred dollars which he had inherited from his mother, left the paternal homestead to seek his fortune in the far West. His first stopping-place was St. Louis; but the moral atmosphere of the place did not quite suit the rigid New Englander, who took thence a supply of Indian goods and the first boat for the Upper Mississippi. On the beau- tiful bluff where the city of St. Paul now stands, Ii   "AEEVILLE.      143 was a trading-post, with the very unromantic name of "Pig's Eye." West made his second pause there, and would have located, but a Catholic priest and Catholic traders claimed everything, and frowned on the young Protes- tant, who resolved to push forward again to some locality new and unchallenged. At Snelling he met the Ojibwa hunters, purchased their furs, and paid them in gold, the'first they had ever received. The same steamer which brought him up the river conveyed his furs down, with an order for a fresh supply of merchandise. Then, with his first little stock undiminished, he was ready to accompany the importunate hunters to their much-boasted Lake of the Great Spirit. The fair, honest countenance of the young man would have been his best recommendation anywhere. There was not a line on his face denoting art or obliquity of purpose; all was clear and open as the day. Long before they reached the lake, the astute Ojibwas bestowed on him the familiar sobriquet of "Bright       Eyes," a name by which he is still lnown on the border. A couimfortalle log-lhouse, rivlling that of the mission, was erected durilng the summer, al nd the village of White Cloud had now, in addition to its bhundredi witigwams, t chaplel anlld school- rooim, a mission-house andtrading-post. Faith said it should be called Lat/,evile. No portion of the nesw trader's stock proved of suchl essential value as his garden seeds and atgricultural utensils. They were a god- send to the missionary, whose narrow garden spot soon spread out into a broaed field, the culture of which afforded him alunaldantd exer- cise and pleasure. The Ojibwa women did their best to imitate the neat angles, straight rows, and square, beds of the teacher's garden; and the young boys were sometimes seen with hoe or spade assisting them. A1L1. Lin- dall encouraged this, and often went himself to draw a line or shape a plot for the un- handy ones. The rapid growth and luxuriance of every   thin-g astonished the young  trader, who, accustoi1med to the sparse vegegtation of his loutlaltalin. fieldls, coulcd acely believe the testiimody of his own eyes.  "'I maust liave va farm her," he said, "if \Vllhit Cloud will sell me landl\ enough. We wotul- t;sooll teatch these idle colppe-skins to Ialk3 a( livinlg out of the earth, instead of ro' vinltg ldl ovetr creation. You are a model gar; ltIr, 5'Nr. Lindall."  l "I like atrlming. It appears to me man's natural vocationl; the most ennobling of all physicatl toil, since the -husbandman is a co- worker with nll ture and God. If, as you say, wet could tt( ]ch1 these nolads to get a living by tilling the oearth, the rest would be easy enu,'g. It \would be a long step toward cixilization.

" Not veqy unlike- some pretty good white folks ill tlat respect,' -West returned, withl h lap'py laughL "If, however, they require to- 10     "6     BENDIXN WILLOW. be shown what land like this is capable of I should be very hlappy to give them clear evidenuce another season. I must have a flarm, if only to look at." It was plain that White Clotul had no more idea of the value of his land than he hlLad of its capabilities. For the half dozen- glittering gold pieces which James West placed before him, he -would have ceded territory enough for a respectably sized county. But the youln man had no wish for any more than he could improve. -A twenty-acre square he regarded as a royal possession, and with the aid of the missionary, so much was defined and bounded. The generous chief looked at the limits, then away over the distant miles of forest and prairie, then at the shiningy eagles in Lis hand, the first he hlad ever possessed, and which he thought would look uncomlmonly fine, worn as ornaments on state occasions, shook his head, and laying thhem before the young trader, said, in broken English, "Too    much! White Cloud got great country! Bright Eyes welcome!" But James West was not one toI take advan- tage of such generosity. He would liave scorned to rob a savage. The glittering coin was returned to him again, and those golden eagles proved a golden band of friendshil and protection to, hundreds of white settlers in the years to come.  XIV. MARTHA FOR a long time Faith missed and mourned her lost companion; and, though satisfied from the first that they would see her no more, she would have given anything she pos- sessed for the assurance of Weenie's safety and happiness. The only amusement left to her was an ocasional ride on old Beshike, Neenaka's pony, which she bade Faith call her own now, as she would never mount it again. Beshike was a cunning animal, and knew how to play "old soldier" when there was any work to do, or burdens to carry. But he was very fond of Faith, and frequently made  his appearance at the mission house of his own accord, where he would thrust his nose in at the door and whinny until she answered his call with a caress and an ear of corn, a handful of salt, or, what he liked better, a lively canter over the prairie. The chieftainess had never mounted him since her return from the maple-woods, and would never do so again, for her aged form was now bent almost double, and she seldom went beyond her wigwam. Mrs. Lindall devoted to her all the, time she could possibly spare from her school and home duties, preparing little delicacies to tempt her feeble appetite and recruit her failing strength. But the presence of the gentle teacher woman was more to Neenaka than dainty food, or pleasant drink. She loved her low, sweet words and the meaning they conveyed. She loved to hear her speak of the Christian's God, the Christian's Saviour, and the Christian's iollme beyond the river of death. Faith often read to her of these, but her mother compre-    150     BENDING WILL W. hended themn better, and spoke to her of them as one speaks of father, brother, and home, not as things seen dimly, and far away. It was evident to every one that the old chieftainess was fast following Listen-to-the- end; and the good missionaries desired no- thing as much as that she might die in the faith of the Gospel. She had always been an attentive listener to the new teacher's doctrine ; but its precepts were so very different from her own preconceptions of right and wrong that she was puzzled. The Medawe's leaning toward the new faith did not quite convince her. "The Medawe was old," she said, "bas old as Neenaka's father.  His mind was wandering back to childhood." But as her strength declined, her mental vision grew clearer and brighter. She could see what a beautiful thing love is in contrast with hatred, and, marking the patient, holy example of the missionaries, was ready to inquire if the red men's religion had been productive of any such fruits of kindness and   self-denial. The straggle between old pre- judices and newly-awtakened conscience was as strong as the indomitable nature of the wo- man; and for some time the issue was doubt- ful. But reason and conscience prevailed at last, and the haughty. savage became as teach- able and humble as a child. In this frame of mind, she sent for Mr. Lin- dall, one morning, and said to him: "Neenaka has a wish. to seek the Great Spirit in the way the White Hand points out. She does not see the path plainly yet." "There is but one path," he replied, gently. "It is through Christ. He is the way. No one can approach the Great Spirit but through lhim. 'There is no other name given under iheaven whereby we can be saved.' I have told you much about this good, heavenly Being. Do you believe in him?" "Neenaka believes!" - Are you willing to confess this belief in the presence of your tribe??" "'Neenaka would-,like to tell her people of   152     BENDING WILLO W. the better way to the spirit land before she sets out on her long journey." Frequent conversations followed, in all of which the aged chieftainess gave evidence of a sincere adoption of .tle Christian faith, and of tlhe desire to testify this faith to her darkened race. For this the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Lindall ovetflowedl with joy and thanllsgiving. One Sundaty raorning, when the chapel service was ended, Mr. Lindall gave notice that tihe ceremony of Christian baptisfm would be per- fortmed in the afternoon at the lodge of the chieftainess. It was a ceremony never wit- nessed by a single member of the tribe, and long before the hour appointed, the whole band was asselmbled around the wigwam. The afternoon was one of the brightest of all the summer. Not a leaf stirred in the air, not a ripple disturbed the calm lake, whose waters the superstitious red men believed the special care of their Great Spirit. A wooden bench was besidle the wiogwamn door with a rude stand before it, on which little Faith bad just   placed her father's Bible, and a handful of wlhite water-lilies. Her eyes were now turned toward the lake expectantly. Mr. tand Mrs. Lindall were within the lodge. White Cloud and his principal men sat on the ground in frout in the order of a council. Behind them were the young men, and further still, the women and children, all grave and silent. It was not long before the handsome form of the young trader was seen approaching, bearing in his hands a bowl which he had just filled with pure water from the lake. He placed it on the stand amid Faith's lilies, and retired to the spot where she was sitting, breathless almost, with the excitement of the strai(nge scene, Before many minutes the curtain of the wigwaml was drawn aside, and the bowed chieftainess appeared, leaning on the arm of Mrs. Lindtall, followed by the missionary. A single exclamation greeted them; the well- known, but never fully interpreted interjection of the Ojibwa. It rose from a hundred -voices  154    BENDImN WILLOW. simultaneously; rung over the peaceful waters of the lake, and was echoed sweetly from the pine forest beyond.* A deeper silence succeeded, broken by the clear voice of the missionary, who addressed a few words to Neenaka in her native tongue. She responded distinctly and unhesitatingly. Every listener could understand her words and their solemn meaning. -Then, in the name of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the baptismal water was'laid on her furrowed forehead, and she received the Christian name of "Martha." The silence of death was on the whole assembly during the impressive ceremony. At its close, the chieftainess sat down on tle -wooden bench and bowed her head while Mr. Lindall uttered a prayer and thanksgiving, that stirred even the grim old chiefs to enthusiasm, and Faith and her mother to tears. The nature of the ceremony was afterward   explained by the teacher in a few words, when the Indians retired with thoughtful faces, impressed with the solemnity of a rite so simple, yet mysterious as any of the rites of their Great Medicine.   XV. A HSTORICAL LESSON.  FAITH'S summer was passed with her books and in the school, where her assistance both as interpreter and teacher was invaluable to her mother. Her own  lessons were never as thoroughly studied before, for, with the ex- ception of a daily visit to Neenaka and an occasional ride on old Besliike, she had little to divert her attention from study. Parley's History was finished and laid aside for a History of England, furnished her by the young trader, who was very fond of books himself, and had brought with him the whole stock he possessed, consistig of two or three   topographical works, a History of England, a copy of Shakspeare, and XEsop's Fables. These weren a rich addition to the mission- ary's one-shelf library. Faith revelled in them, and even consented to part with her beloved Pilgrim for a time in return. "I would like it better if you would teach me a little Latin," he said, in reply to her offer. "I made a beginning once by myself, but got boggled and had to give it up." i, "Mr. Lindall would teach you with plea- sure," Mrs. Lindall said, overhearing the conversation. "Faith is only a - beginner herself and would study with you." "I could show you a good deal," said Faith, quietly. "Mamnma has no idea how much I know about Latin. I know all the declensions perfectly, and some of the verbs. Have you got a grammar, James?" James replied that he had not, but would send for one withi his next order to St. LTouis. -,I don't suppose," said Faith, "you can get that here before next spring; but you will    158     I3BEXDI)u  ILLOJ be nearly through mine by that time. I never take it to school with me, because so much Chlppewa noise drives it all out of my head. You can have it every morning, if you will, while I study your History of England, w!litl I like very much. Do you know it all?" "Yes," he replied, without hlesitation. "What! from the Heptarchlly down to the Hanoverian dynasty? I don't believe it " "Faith," said her mother, reprovis,!Vy, "where is your politeness?" James West only laughlled, one of hs clear, musiefl laughs, which Mr. Lindall often de- clared as good as a flute. "If you don't believe it, try me then, my little girl; and for every question I miss, T will paddle you once across the lake." Faith ran for the book and opened it at random. "When did Oliver Cromwell die?" she   "I don't believe it, if you do," rejoined Faith, merrily; " for it don't say a word about it here. - Where did you find it?" "In the 'Lives of the Pulritins,' an old book with one cover which I used to borrow of my grandmother. I liked it first-rate, but she wouldl never give it to me." "Wasn't she mean! But I shall catch you yet. I ought to have known that a New Englander would know all about time Puritans. Now;, then, when did Julius Coesar invade Eigland?" "JFifty years before Christ, more or less. He found no one there but a lot of savages, dressced in wolf-skins. You would never have known them from Chippewas. They were our :(nclstor's', you know." "No I didn't. But you have missed one question so soon. It was fifty-five years before the Clhristian era when the Romans invaded England. I will have my canoe ride." "But, I said fifty, more or less. I couldn't possibly paddle the 'Wild Goose' all the way    over the lake for that.  I will leave it to your miother, if that was a mistake." "Well, never mind.  Who was the first real king of England?" "Eglert, of course. Harold, the last of Iris lineC, was killed at the battle of Hastings. William the Conqueror succccdld him. He was the first of the Norman kings, and Rich- ard II. The last. His cousin, the Duke of Lancaster, took the throne without as muchl as saying 'With your permission,' and was crowned as Henry IV. 211(iy/t made il/ght with him, and with his son, too, who was as brave as a tiger-cat; but his grandson, Henry VI., was a simpleton. The two great crowns of England and France, which were placed on his head when he was only nine months old, must have crushed out his wit, if he ever had any; and the grandson of Richard II. thought there never would be a better time to take oack the stolen crown.' So he began a war with a little rose in his hat for an ensign. The king's party wore a cr. onie, and the two   roses fought tough and tight for thirty -years, when a prince of the red rose married a princess of the white, in 1485; and with them commenced the Tudor dynasty." "Stop," said Faith, "you've got ahead of me, and I don't know whether you are right or wrong."  "There is no use in your trying to puzzle me i that look, Faith, for I can talk English History as long as your father can talk Bible, and make as few mistakes. You see, I hadin't much else to stcudy in the old kitchen, winter evenings. If you like, I will lecad you right through the House of 7Tr,1or, stop and visit Henry VIII. and his six wives, talke ( look at good Queen Bess, Cand tilen on to the Stuarts, a most unfortunate race. I can do it as easily as Mr. Lindall can run through the Penta- teuch. But you shall have a voyage in the ' Wil  Goose' this afternoon, nevertheless, if your mother says so, and I will tell you how to learn history ,so as to remember it."     162    BENDLING WILLOW.   . "But tell me first," persisted Faith, "why the Stuarts were unfortunate?" "Because they came in contact with the Puritans, who proved too much fot them, and they have been too much for everybody since who has meddled with them. They were willing to live in peace in their own way, but crowns add dominions could never force them into any other." "It was fortunate they were honest, God- fearing men," interposed Mrs. Lindall, inte- rested, as she always was, in the conversation of the young New Englander. "Yes, ma'am, very lucky; for if they had undertaken to serve Satan, they would have made a bad job of it. But what is Faith laughing at now?" "I was thinking you are so earnest and determined you might be a little like them, sir." "A little? Why, I am as much like them as old Paul was like a Jew! I am a Puritan of the Puritans; and if there isn't room enough for me in Europe, I shall emigrate."   A HSTORICAL LES$ON.   163 Never were truer words spoken. James West had emigrated in fact. The poor little rugged farm with half a dozen half-brothers and sisters. had cramped the young moun- taineer beyond endurance. Not but that he could have forced a living from any soil, but he wanted more than mere subsistence; he wanted room to grow, leisure to read and think, space to become a man untrammelled and independent. He took the Latin grammar, and Mr. Lin- dall was only too happy to aid him whenever he needed aid, though he persisted in calling Faith his teacher. The mission school was becoming more and more popular with the natives, and many of the young women as well as children attended for the purpose of learning to sew. But the labdr pressed very heavily on Mrs. Lindall, whose naturally fine constitution and perfect health were in danger of breaking down from over-exertion. She worked cheerfully, and never complained; but her husband was not     164     BENDING WILLO W. blind to her danger, and sought to avert it in season by communicating to the Home Soci- ety, from which he received a trifling stipend, the fact that their school required an as- sistant. His demands upon the society were too few to pass unheeded; for, with a devotion rarely equalled, every dollar of his own pri- vate income was appropriated to the work which lay so near his heart. But he could not witness his wife's unremitting toil, by day and night, without a pang; and to his repre- sentation and appeal came the cheering reply that they might be prepared to receive an assistant by the next supply-boat to the fort. This was good news indeed, and the mission house received the addition of a new room without delay, in view of the expected comer. As soon as it was completed, Mr. Lindall and James West set out for Snelling, the latter to receive his winter supplies, the former to meet Miss Anthony. The three weeks of their   A HSTORICAL LESSON.    165 absence were exceedingly long to Faith and her mother, who not only missed the absent, but were full of curiosity respecting the new teacher. -----     XVI. THE NEW TEACHER-AND WHY A PORTION OF THE OJIBWAS WERE FIRST CALLED PILLAGERS. OME persons seem made to fit smoothly into odd places. No matter from what antecedents they are broken off, how much they may have bled or suffered, there are no splinters, nothing to wound or offend those with whom they are placed in new\relations. It may be the result of large sympathy; but is more probably due to some internal process, which has wrought out a grand spiritual harmony. Alice Anthony was such a person. Past youth, past beauty, though not so far past either but that their traces were clearly perceptible; there was still an atmosphere of (166)   THE NEW TEACAER.     167 sweetness and peace around the woman that failed not to charm and bind irresistibly. Though her previous life was altogether a sealed book, she had not been at the mission a week before every member of the family felt as though they had, known and loved her always. Nor was this attraction felt by the  Lindalls alone. The little Ojibwas followed her from the school-room, clinging to the skirt of her dress, a privilege which Faith was very strongly inclined to dispute with them. The school was Boon surrendered entirely to the new teacher, with Faith as assistant and interpreter, as she had been before for her mother. Mrs. Lindall had now more leisure for her home duties, more time to devote to the comfort of her husband and child, and to the sick of the tribe, especially to the old chieftainess, whose life was bright- ening toward its close, cheered by an unfalter- ing faith in the Son of God. The words of, Neenaka had much weight with her people, who all regarded her with filial reverence and     168     BENDIZNG WILLOW. affection. But no tender care can long pre- serve a life whose vital energies are exhausted. She lingered through the glorious Indian summer, and when the autumn days were getting chill with winter, was buried beneath the first snow. That was a pleasant winter for the mission- aries, and for the young trader, too, who had plenty of time for reading and study, while the hunters were gathering their harvest for the spring trade. The difficulties in the Latin grammar were soon overcome, and long before spring he and Faith were reading with great satisfaction Viri Nomae, and'discussingtogether the illustrious Romans. Miss Anthony was as good a linguist as Mr. Lindall, and when- ever the latter was busy with his Bible translation, she would assume the pleasant iask of listening to their reading or correcting their exercises. And when the lessons were over, they had other reading more social and enjoyable. Miss Alice had made a valuable addition to   THE NEZW TEACBER..    169 their limited supply of books, in Rollin's Universal History, and the Standard British Poets. Every evening they read a given number of pages in the former aloud, enliven- ing their exercise with such stories and anecdotes as the subject suggested. Such stories are a very agreeable aid to the memory, and no mental recreation can be more healthy or profitable. Mr. and Mrs. Lindall enjoyed the readings exceedingly, and contributed their share to the general amusement. There was far less sickness this winter in the village than the last, and many more comforts. The mission house was enlarged and newly covered; a cellar had been pre- pared for the preservation of the garden esculents, and the trader's stores furnished some things much needed, of which they had been altogether destitute before I The school- room and chapel were also made warm and comfortable, so that neither the labors of the Sabbath nor of the week suffered interruption. Poor little Weenie's snow-shoes fell to Miss     170    BENDOIN WILLO W. Alice, and she- and Faith had lively walks over the beautiful white fields, sometimes venturing far out on the lake, where were tracks ofl deer' and bears that went in the night time to the openings for drink. And one day they had a ride, altogether too novel to be overlooked or forgotten. For some time James West had been secretly taxing his Yankee ingenuity in the attempt to construct some sort of a sledge out of the rough material at hand, and with the few tools whicP he and Mr. Lindall happened to possess, iti was no easy thing to do; but the greater tie difficulties to be overcome, the more determined was that young gentleman, always. He had plenty of green logs, an axe and an adz. He could, make wooden pins to serve in place of nails; and after a while, by dint of much hewing and hacking, a vehicle ar)se, that challenged the highest admiration of the Ojibwa youth, who had watched it' step by step from the beginning, wondering much at its design and purpose.   THE NEW TEA CHER.     171 The construction of harnesses from green buffalo skins was a task scarcely less difficult ,than that of building a sledge of 'rough logs; but the work was assayed, and resulted in like success. Two stout ponies, purchased of -an old Ottertail chief for the transportation of his furs, were next to be broken to harness. They were! shaggy creatures, never trimmed nor curried, but patient and gentle; moreover very fond of the young trader's petting and caressing, as well as of the warm shelter he had provided them. They manifested no de- cided disaffection when the new harnesses were fitted, nor when the great sled was made fast behind them; nor any affright at the wild whoopings of the young aborigines, who followed, astonished at every movement. No two animals were ever more deaf to discords, and after a few days' training and taming to uniform motion, the new vehicle, completely enveloped in soft buffalo-robes, was attached to them, and one bright morning they were driven down to the mission house.     172    BENDING WILLOW. Such a burst of astonishment and delight as awaited them there! Neither of the ladies, nor even Faith, had had the slightest intima- tion of the great pleasure in preparation for them., The secret had only been confided to Mr. Lindall, who preserved it well to the last, and that very morning detained Miss Alice and Faith from their customary walk, on some trifling pretext, that they might have the ,more novel entertainment of a ride in an es- tablishment that would have created a greater sensation on Broadway than a dozen modern velocipedes. It did not take the ladies long to make their preparation; and, when warmly wrapped, and seated in the "splendid sleigh," as Faith de- nominated it, she clapped her hands and shouted as she had never done since that morning when their motley cavalcade defiled through the sally-port at Snelling. Her en- thusiasm was contagious. James West snapped his whip and screamed to the shaggy ponies, whose shuffling gait threw Mrs. Lin-   THE NEW TEACHER.     173 dall and 'Miss. Alice into paroxysms of laughter. Thus they were driven all around the village and far out on the prairie, followed by the delighted young Ojibwas, venting their enthusiasm by every imaginable sign of applause. It was a stirring ad- venture to them all, an epoch in the long winter. On their return, they were met by an aged Ojibwa, who begged the strange canoe might not venture on the lake, lest the Great Spirit should be angry and drive away the fish from the red men's nets thereafter. They promised not even to approach the border of the lake; and would not for the world have done vio- lence to the old man's prejudices by driving over his sacred -water. White Cloud was at the mission when the - merry party arrived there. He and Mr. Lin- dall were next treated to an excursion, which so charmed the chief that he offered a hundred beaver skins for Bright Eye's snow-canoe. The trader would not accept his offer, but promised     174     BENiING WILLOW. him one as a free gift before the next season of snows. :During this ride, the inquisitive young trader learned the origin of the Lake Indians, and why they were called "Pillagers." He ihad often inquired of their old men, but none of them seemed willing to impart the desired information. "My people do not like the name," said the ingenuous chief. "They prefer to be called 'The Lake People.' But Flat Mouth, our great uncle at Leech Lake, tells the tale with- out shame, as a warning to his young men against vanity and dishonesty. "Our fathers were of the Leech Lake Ojib- was, which numbered many of the bravest men of the nation. Brave men scorn to do mean actions. But a band of their young men were once encamped at the mouth of a small river that flows into the Northern Mississippi. They were going to have a grand Medicine dance there, in which the Mississippi bands were to participate. On the- eve of the   THE "PlZLAaERS."     175 festival, a strange canoe came floating down the river, borne only by the current. The young men saw it, and drew it to the shore. A sick man was lying helpless in the bottom of the canoe. All around him were piled gay cloths and beads and feathers, which he had brought from the Great Lakes to barter with the Mississippi Indians for furs. The stranger was white and spoke a language the Leech Lake people did not understand. But they could easily have understood that he-was sick, and required kind care, had not their eyes been dazzled with his gay merchandise, and their foolish minds filled withlthoughts of the approaching dance. "'Give us some articles for to-night, and we will load you with furs to-morrow,' they said to the poor trader, who only shook his head. He was too sick to traffic. "'He will die before to-morrow,' said one of the vainest and most thoughtless of their number;' and I must have some of his fine articles for to-night.' / /     176    BENDING WILLO W. "Accordingly he helped himself to whatever best suited his fancy. "When his companions saw him decked out very gayly, they were ashamed of their own shabby appearance, and said one to another: 'We might as well follow the example of "Curly Head;" no doubt the stranger will die, if not we will fill his canoe with furs on the morrow.' Only the son of Black Duck, their chief, protested against the out- rage, and his swords .were unheeded. The poor trader's articles were all appropriated, and he could make no resistance. "The dance was kept up until morning. Then the guilty young fellows began to think about the sick man whom they had left lying in his canoe on the margin of the creek, and the great wrong they had done him. They hastened to the spot. The stranger was no where to be found. His canoe had disap- peared with him in the darkness. But the Sauk Indians who dwell a hundred miles below, told of a strange canoe, with the dead   THE "PILLAa ERS."     1" body of a pale-face that went over the rapids and was lodged on the sands below. "To this day, the little stream where the wicked young men where encamped is called 'Pillage Creek,'* and the whole band of Indians to which they belonged are Pilla- gers. "It was a sad day when tidings of the evil deed were borne to Leech Lake. The old men of the nation shook their heads, and said, 'Their cheeks were tingling with shame. Their Great Spirit would be sure to avenge so cowardly a deed as robbing a sick man, and a stranger, whom he had sent to do them good.' "Many nights they sat in solemn council. At last it was determined that the offenders should go away to the Great Lake, and bear the richest furs of their winter hunt to the white men there, to make restitution for the articles they had so foolishly pillaged. * Pillage Creek-about ten miles above the Crow-wing River-empties into the Mississippi. 12     178     BENDING WILLOW. "They departed with down-hanging heads, the son of their chief accompanying them, as before. The white traders of the Lake received them kindly, and gave. them on their return a bright red flag, a medal, and a'bale of goods for their chief, with the strict injunction not to open the bale, nor unfurl the flag until they reached their own country. But on their way, they met a party of their brethren of a kindred tribe, and wished to display their treasures. The medal was shown, the scarlet flag unfurled, and the bale of goods opened. Their noble young leader was the first to fall sick, and die there in the forest. Most of the others sickened also, and a grpat pestilence spread all over the land, filling it with new graves.

A LETTER. MRS. LINDAILL'S trial came sooner than she anticipated. They were becom- ing very happy in their new home- happy in the consciousness of doing good, of blessing and being blessed. Since the advent of James West and Miss Anthony; the world had not seemed so very far away from them; they were a little world in themselves, bearing one another's burdens, and sharing one another's joys. Communica- tion with the fort was becoming more fre- quent, and the. fort was the blessed link between them and home. They had now been three years in the Indian country. The mission was fully estab-     180    BENDING WTILLO W. lished, their labors were prospering, and they had ceased to think of change. Mr. Lindall's health had never been as vigorous before, and Faith's cheeks were like two prairie roses. It was a long time since the old thought and pain had pierced her mother's heart-"This is no place to rear a delicate young girl." She had become well satisfied with the place, and with her daughter's proficiency, as well she might, with such teachers as her husband and Miss Anthony, to say nothing of her own wise, motherly counsel. But the trial came, and came in the -garb of pleasure; in other words, in a letter from her only sister, who wrote at the conclusion of a long, kind epistle: "Faith must be nearly thirteen now, as old as our Gracie, who will enter the seminary at the commencement of the next academic year. I do not suppose your child can be as far ad-. vanced, but a year in one of our excellent pre. paratory schools might enable her to pass the requisite examination another season.

A few years of civilization will remedy that, however, before her habits become too firmly established. I know you do not think of rearing her among savages, and she is more than welcome to a home with us. Put her in charge of Col. S- when he comes East this summer, and he will bring her to me. His  daughter is here in a private boarding-school. I have written to him on the subject, and am certain it will be only a pleasure to him to take care of Faith. "How I wish you could come too, my dear, only sister, lost to us all! But I will be a mother to your child for your sake as well as her own, for I remember her as exceedingly interesting. Do not try to fit her out any further than to make her decent on the way. "My children talk much about their little     182     BEND1vNGWILLOW. 'Ojibwa cousin,' and will welcome her with all their hearts, as will, , "Your ever faithful sister, "KATE." Mrs. Lindall's heart hushed its beatings as she read; her hands seemed to grow rigid; her eyes dim. At the close, a half-stifled moan burst from her lips. Every one was absorbed in the recent dispatches from the East, even to Faith, who had several illustrated papers and magazines, which she had taken to her favorite garden-bench to examine and read.. Miss Alice had gone to her own room with her letters, and Mr. Lindall was poring over a comnaunication from the Home Society relative to the erection of a new chapel; but that ill-suppressed cry of grief did not escape his ear. In all their years of trial together, such an outhurst from his heroic wife had never pierced his heart before. The letter he was reading dropped from his hands, and he was at her side in an instant. V    A LETTER.       183 "Te'J me what it is, Mary? What new sorrow we have to bear?  Don't look so s rickeA/' he said, folding her tenderly in his arms. S' You can have no grief which is not mine aisc!"' "Our child, Paul! -Our darling! How can we part with her?" For a moment he fancied his wife's senses were forsaking her. "Nothing has befallen Faith," he said. "She is in the garden with her papers, blithe as any bird." "Read! read!" she said, thrusting her sister's letter into his hand; "and may God strengthen us to do our duty." Mr. Lindall did read, and pondered well as he read; but he saw nothing in her sister's letter to arouse such unwonted  emotion. Only an invitation to be accepted or declined, as they deemed expedient. He had not the slightest suspicion how darkly that shadow of separation had hovered around his wife's sleeping and waking hours for years, nor     184     BENDING WILL W. what pain its sudden re-appearance hadi revived. "Sister Kate is very kind," he said, quietiv folding the closely-written missive.. "But I see no necessity for acting on her suggestion at present. Our child is in the best prepara- tory school I can desire for her-the school of her mother's example." "She has your instruction, Paul, and Miss Anthony's; and I don't perceive that her manners are particularly unrefined. But yet. what will she ever know of the world or of life here?" "As much perhaps as will qualify her to aid in the great work we have undertaken. Too much might unfit her entirely for it." "But this is our woork, and not hers," returned Mrs. Lindall, "unless God give her the disposition to accept it as such. In bind- mg ourselves to it, our child should be left free; and I am not certain, if she knows no other life than this, whether she will be truly free, or able to act fdr herself intelligently.    A LETTER.       185 That is what troubled me more than anything else when we first entered upon our work. Lately, I have seen Faith so happy, and studious, and useful too, I had quite forgotten we owed her any duty beyond our own labor and pleasure." "Your argument has force, my dear," re- plied Mr. Lindall; " but there are some things to urge against it. Let us, however, leave the subject for the present undecided. Duty will shine clearly at last." But while the lips forebore to mention it, it was not easy to banish it from their minds. Mr.: Lindall saw his wife drooping from day to day under its silent burden, while his own heart was ill at ease. "We will have to come to a decision," he said, mentally, " and it is cowardly to evade it thus." So that bright spring afternoon, when Faith was planting her flower-beds, and Mrs. Lindall and Miss Alice were seated to gether in the porch, watching the eave. swallows build their nests, he left his books i .     186    BENDING WILLOW . and joined them. Faith espied him in an instant. "O papa! come here a minute, wont you? James has given me a lot of new flower- seeds, and my beds wont be half large enough know. Couldn't you cut me two circles before the door?" "I will think of it, daughter. But come to us now; I wish to have a talk with you. You may finish that border first, if you like." Then turning to Miss Anthony, in a voice so low Faith could not overhear, he said: "I wish to ask you a plain question, Miss Alice, and desire an honest answer. We have been thinking whether a few years at the East would benefit Faith or not. How do her manners impress you? Her mother and I cannot of course judge her impartially." "Faith is as fresh and sparkling as a dew- drop, and would be, anywhere," was the unhesitating reply. "But she lacks refinement, perhaps?" "No!" said Miss Anthony. "She has a   A LETTER.      187 native politeness and sprightliness, which are better than any artificial graces. I am aston- ished you should doubt it." "But our daughter may not remain with us always," interposed Mrs. Lindall. "Silver Lake may be but the 'happy valley' of her childhood. By-and-by she will be looking over the shining hills, and sighing for what lies beyond." "Wherefore anticipate?" suggested Miss Anthony, in her ever cheerful, pleasant way; "in Ojibwa parlance,' The waters of the Lake of the Great Spirit may satisfy her, and prevent the fever of the world.'" "If this were only possible," said Mrs. Lindall, parenthetically. "But," continued Miss Anthony, "the world could never send her back to the 'happy valley' with the dew of her youth undried. Faith is as happy as the birds now, and lvhy should you trouble yourself about the future which God ordains?" Faith finished her flower-borders, and came     188     BENDING WILLO W. skipping up to the porch with a great, brown hop-toad in her apron, which she called "Moses," "because," she said, "he was the leader of his people." That toad was one of the family pets, and looked as gray and warty as if he had lived half a century at least. lMr. Lindall called him old "Bufo," * which was his real name, you know; and he would not suffer him to be harmed, because he was very useful in destroying the noxious insects that feed on the tender garden vines.  "When Moses dies, papa," said Faith, "James and I are going to have a post- mortem examination of his head, and see if we cannot find the jewel. It lies somewhere here, he says, between the eyes, and is worth all the Ojibwa charms put together." "I am afraid James teaches you a good deal of nonsense, Faith." "No, he does not. He only tells me such stories as are written in books, and I like them ever so much." * Toad-Genus Bufo vulqaris.   A LETTER.      189 "What have you been reading to day? I had no time to attend to your Latin." "Miss Alice heard our lesson. It was about the Sclpios, and she told us how the family first obtained their name. Do you know, papa?" "I used to know when I was a boy. Let me see if you can aid my memory now." "There was an old patrician family in Rome by the name of Cornelia. The father was blind. His son Publius used to lead him around everywhere, until all the people used to call the younAg man ' Scpio,' which means 'a staff.' This young man was as brave as he was good, and from him were descended some of the wisest and greatest menof Rome, who were all called Scipios, with their old family name prefixed." "That is a very good story, and a true one too, Faith," returned her father. "But put old Bufo down now. I wish to speak to you about something else." "Perhaps I had better wash my hands,"     190    BENDING WILLOW. said Faith. "Moses was a little surly, and may have been trying to give me some of his warts." A smile passed from lip to lip as the happy young girl disappeared. Returning soon, she took her favorite seat on her father's knee, put both arms around his neck and said, demurely: "I'am  to have a lecture, I suppose." "Not this time, deary. I am going to read you a letter we had fro m your Aunt Kate, and she what you think about it." The letter had never been  opened or referred to since the day of its arrival. Neither Faith nor Miss Anthony had heard anything of it before, and the former was particularly curious to know what it contained. But, before it was half read, her lips quivered, and her eyes filled with tears. Her mother listened without a trace of the emotion Which its first perusal had excited, and said not a word at its conclusion. No one spoke, indeed, until Faith, with a keen glance from one of her.   A LETTER.      191 parents to the other, exclaimed, with an out- burst of passionate tenderness: "You are not going to send me away from you, are you? I shall die, if you do! Only let me stay, and I will do everything you wish. I will give up play and everything else, if you only wont send me away from you." "Be composed, my child," said her father, pressing her tearful face closer to his own. "You shall never leave us against your will. We thought you might be pleased to go to the city for a while and live with your cousins."  "No, I don't care anything about the city nor my cousins! I was there once, you know, and did not like it at all. They think me almost an Indian. I wouldn't leave you and mamma alone here for all Boston." "But you would have an opportunity of learning many things there, my child, which you cannot possibly learn here. And you could' have as many books as you wish." 1?      192     BENDING WILLO W. "We have quite a good many here now; and I can learn everything you and mother and Miss Alice. know, and that will be much more than my poor head will hold. But then," she added, with a touch of spirit, "there is no use in talking about it, for I wont go!" She rushed out of the porch, down the garden path to her favorite seat, where she wept without restraint, while her mother stole away silently to her own room. The question which had perplexed her so long was settled for the present, at least, and she would not distrust the future. That evening James West paddled Miss Alice and Faith far out on the lake. There were no traces of tears on the cheeks of the latter, only a little quiver on the lips as she told the young trader how nearly she had been banished from  her beloved home. "And," she added, very gravely, "you must not invite me to take many more rides now, as I mean to leave play, and study so hard, they   A LETTER.      193 will never think again of sending me away from here to gain knowledge. And as for manners, I don't care who mistakes me for a wild Ojibwa." 13     XVIII. ORPHEUS AND SAYADIO. THE fur-trade of Silver Lake proved far more extensive and lucrative than was anticipated. From leagues and leagues of forest, the finest. peltry of the Northwest came pouring  into the young trader's log-post until there was not room for another skin. "I will have a store-house before another season, equal to the requirement," said West, confidently. "And I will pay the hunters and trappers so liberally, they will not waste much time in their smoky wigwams, telling Mzun- chausens. The best way to encourage indus- try is to make it pay." It took a number of pack-horses to convey 194   ORPR:EUS AND SAYADIO.    195 the trader's furs to the distant fort,.where they were to await transportation to St. Louis. West was absent more than two months, and when he returned, was accompanied by two men, one to superintend his farm, the other, a practical carpenter. He brought also a large stock of goods, suited to the traffic, and a newspaper in which his name was asso- ciatec as partner with one of the oldest firms in the West. The young New Englander was now fairly afloat, and, with the supervision of his farm and store-house, had as little time for play as Faith. He continued to take time for the Latin lessons, however, and when his carpenter had constructed a fine new boat, insisted on an occasional row upon the lake with Mr. Lin- dall, or the ladies of the mission. Miss Alice and Faith, who were quite inseparable, enjoyed the evenings on the water exceedingly. All the old stories they had ever read or heard were revived for these pleasant occasions, and the young trader was able to furnish them many     196     BENDING WILLOW new ones, gathered from the old story-tellers who were accustomed to congregate at his trading-post. Some of them were quite as remarkable as any of the tales of Listen-to-the- end, and interested Miss Anthony, particularly, as corroborative of the Oriental origin of the red men of North America. This was a the- ory which she and Mr. Lindall were never weary of discussing; and every legend or tradition having a counterpart in Eastern myth or song was hailed as a new link in their chain of evidence. One fine summer evening they were all to- gether on the lake. Mr. Lindall had that day completed the translation of some hymns into the Ojibwa tongue, and proposed they should sing them to familiar tunes, out there on the water. Never had the meaning of those old Lutheran chants been rendered in sweeter words or accents, than mingled with the air of that summer evening. The forest echoes caught the strain and wafted back the melody. The party rowed quite across the lake, vent        ORPHEUS AND SAYADIO.    197 ashore and gathered some moccasin-flowers and sweet-scented pyrolas, took a little stroll among the balsaml-breathing pines, then re- embarked. The sun had gone down,' and the evening star was reflected in the peaceful water. "ti ow to the ' Eastern Woman,'" said Faith, nodding her own head playfully to the shadow of the silvery planet. "Weenie used to tell me ever so many stories about the evening and morning star. Poor Weenie! How I wish I could see her again." While they were talking of the little Daco- tah, recalling in tender tones many of her odd words ansd ways, and marvelling at her fate, the conversation was interrupted by the wild strains of an Indian flute which came. floating to them from the opposite shore. For a day or two a strange youth had been seen limping around the village, dressed as fancifully as a girl, though in a boy's thabiliments, his face painted and his head feathered like a mimic warrior. Twice he had beei to the door of the mission and looked in as if to discover     198    BENDING WILL 0W. some person; and the evening before, he sat on the steps of the chapel and played a low, plaintive melody far into the night. No one knew or heeded him. "There is our Orpheus again," said Miss Anthony. "If he were not so young, I could fancy him lamenting some red Eurydice." "I think his notes are a good deal more like those of a piping Pan," replied West. "I submit it to Mr. Lindall now, whether in point of history he does not belong to an earlier era than that of Greece, the era of horns and goat-skins!" "I have no doubt," interrupted Faith, "you all enjoy your learned comparisons extremely. But what am I to do, who have not the slightest clue to their meaning? Listen, and be silent?" "You may ask as many questions as you please for information," returned her father. "Well, then, in the first place, who was Orpheus? When did he live, and how did he achieve his fame? I should like to know too a   ORiPHEUS AND SAYADIO.    199 little about that hard-named individual he was supposed to be lamenting." They all smiled while Mr. Lindall replied, "Orpheus, my daughter, was a very celebrated musician and poet of antiquity. It would be difficult to tell the exact time when any of the heroes and heroines of mythological story flourished, as they all lived before the era of authentic history. Eusebius, the ancient his- torian of whom I was telling you the other day, says that Orpheus lived about a hundred years before the fall of Troy, or about a thdu- sand years before Christ. He- was the son of Apollo, and probably inherited his musical taste as well as talent from his father. If wet may trust tradition, he was born in a cavern in Thrace, sent to Egypt to be educated, and afterwards became a friend of Cadmus. He went with Jason in quest of the ' Golden Fleece,' and wrote an account of the expe- dition. His wife, Eurydice, was bitten by a serpent and died. Then, inconsolable for her loss, Orpheus determined to follow her to the     200    BENDING WILLOW. kingdom of the dead, and, if possible, bring her back again to life. "With only his wonderful lyre for companion, he went singing through the realms of sha- dow; and finally, by the aid of his sweet music, gained admission to the palace of Pluto. Proserpine, the wife of Pluto, jlead his cause, and he obtained permission at length to lead Eurydice to earth again, on condition he would not look at her until they had reached the light of day. He accepted the terms, and they were almost at the opening above. But the footfalls of Eurydice were too soft for her husband to hear. Fearing she might haye been left behind, he turned only for one moment to relieve his anxiety. She was there, following closely behind him; but, as he looked, she vanished back into shadow again, and was lost to him forever. "The music of Orpheus' lute was never heard again on the earth. He wandered lonely and disconsolate amid the Thracian mountains and met a violent death from the cruel barbarians."   ORPHEUS AND SAYADIO.    201 "I have just the mate to that story now," said West, whose oars had been resting in their row-locks while he listened to Mr. Lin- dall's recital. "An old Rocky Mountain hunter told it to me the other evening, and said it was true, and that he had seen relatives of the young hero with his own eyes. I think myself it is as true as the other. The story is this: "One evening a young Wyandott was wandering up and down the forest, praying to his guardian spirit to lead him to the 'Land of Souls.' There was no moon, and only one solitary star in the sky. The young men and maidens of his tribe sought him out, and bade him return to-their feasts and merry-makings. But he would not hear them; his heart was too sad to listen. The young brave was mourning for his only sister, the fairest flower of the Wyandotts, whom dark spirits had led away; and he resolved to follow them to Ghezig* and bring her back. * Ghezig, Land of Souls.     202     BENDING WILLOW. "It was a long, misty path, and his feet grew weary; his limbs became entangled in thickets and were torn. The night grew darker every moment, as he wandered helpless. "An old man found him at length, faint and half-dead. He brought him water, and when his strength was revived, bade him tell him the secret of his grief. It happened that this old man was Master of the Spirit-land, and when he had heard the young man's story, he said, very kindly: "'My son, I have a gift for you! Take in your hand this magic gourd. The kingdom of the dead lies before you. Go forward with- out fear!' "It was now daybreak, and the young man pursued his journey with fresh strength and courage, holding fast the old man's gift. About sunset he reached the entrance of the Land of Souls, and paused to listen to the enrapturing music that stole through the opening. The sweetest singing he had ever heard was blended with the soft notes of the   ORPHEUS AND SAYADIO.    203 Indian flute. Then the deeper tones of the drum and the lively rattles were calling the spirits to the evening dance. "Sayadio stole in. unperceived. Shining bands of youths and maidens, in robes of snowy whiteness, were gathering on every side. Among them was his lost sister, looking fairer than any dream. She passed near him in the dance, and he stretched out his hands towards her. But she neither saw him nor heeded him, and he bowed his head and wept. "Near him stood a shining spirit in glittering robes, and wearing a jewelled crown. It was the Master again, but no longer bent and old. Sayadio could not see him, for his eyes were dim with grief. "'Look up, my son,' the spirit whispered, kindly. 'Strive not to hide your tears. Mortals will weep, and in their blindness call back happy spirits to the homes they have left behind. I know you are brave, and will not shrink from receiving a sign from the Master of Life. For one hour, then, I will     204     BENDING WILLOW. give you a charm to draw your sister to you. Take then this mystic signal.' "The youth received it, and turned again to the dancers, amid whom the light, graceful form of his sister was still seen. When her face looked toward him once more, he lifted his hand and made the mysterious sign the good Master had just given him. When she saw it, the maiden paused irresolute, or like one in a dream. After a moment's hesitation, she rushed to her brother's arms, and poured into his ears the tenderest words of affection. While they were conversing together, Sayadio, watching his opportunity, made. a sudden scoop, and caught ,up her spirit in his magic gourd. Then he fled through the open por- tals, and ran without stopping, or once look- ing behind him, until the music of the Spirit- land grew faint, and its bright lights dim. .: "There was great joy when Sayadio reached the home of mortals again. As soon as the notes of his victory-hymn were heard in the forest, young and old went forth to meet and   ORPHEUS AND SAYADIO.    205 welcome him; and when they heard his tale and'learned that he had been to Ghezig, they were filled with wonder and awe. "Sayadio addressed the youthful companions of his sister, and bade them go all together and bring her body from its grave by the White Earth.  "His words awoke a loud response, and with eager haste, they started for the forest river, with Sayadio at their head. Before they set out, however, he entrusted to three old women, who tarried behind, his precious gourd, with the strictest injunctions not to look into it, or open it, before his return. But one of their number, more curious than wise, was not able to resist the temptation. "'L et me raise the lid, just for one peep,' she said. 'It can do no manner of harm,' She did so, and something glided past her like a spirit. "The youths and maidens returned, chanting their gayest songs. But when Sayadio ob- served the frightened faces of the old women,     206     BENDING WILLOW. and saw them searching wildly all around, his heart sank within him. He knew his treasure had escaped from them.  "'She has not gone,' they cried; 'for though we cannot see her, we hear the rustle of her wings in the air around us.' "Every one bent his ears to listen. Presently they heard a strain of music, such music as rarely falls on the ears of mortals, and a sweet voice was singing: '"I am a spirit, and I cannot stay! They call me back to the Land of Souls! Come with me, my brother, where no heart is sad!' "Sayadio heard the voice, and dropped his head like one who is falling into a deep sleep. His ears grew deaf to every call of his young companions. All that long, summer night they watched beside him and the body of his sister, and the next morning, at break of day, with great weeping and lamentation,'the brother and sister, bravest and fairest of the Wyan- dotts, were laid in the open grave together.'.'   XIX. A SURPRISE.   'HE sound of the strange youth's flute grew more and more distinct as the boat drew near the shore. They did not notice it while West was relating his thrilling story, but when it was ended, and silence was restored, the wild strains floated out to them again, rising and falling in sweet and measured  cadences. Following tales so weird as those to which they had been listening, Faith's inquiry did not appear very unatural: "Are you quite sure, James, that is the lame boy's flute?" "No, not at all!" he replied, laughing. "I still think it is Pan. Or, may be it is the (207)     208    BENDiNG WILLOW. young Wyandott, come back again from Ghezig. I am bound to ask him when we go on shore." "Does no one know whence he comes?" Mr. Lindall asked. "From some of the neighboring bands, I presume, as he speaks pure Ojibwa. He inquires for White Cloud, who is at Ottertail, and will not be back for a day or two." Daylight had quite faded away before the trader's boat reached'its landing-place below the mission; but a full summer moon compen- sated for its loss. "Now for the musician!" said West, when he had tied his punt to a sapling birch. "I will call and report to you, Miss Faith, on my way to the village; that is, unless you and Miss Alice would like to accompany me." Faith looked beseechingly at Miss Anthony, and said, "Do let us go!" "If your father and mother have no objec- tion, I do not care if we do," she replied. "The evening is quite too pleasant for sleep."   A SURPRISE.      209 So the three bent their steps toward the little chapel, while Mr. and Mrs. Lindallwalked slowly homeward. The musician was not on the chapel steps, as the sounds indicated; but a little farther on, they discovered him within the inclosure that marked the grave of Listen-to-the-end. "Hush!" whispered Faith, grasping a hand of each of her companions. "Not another step! Wait! I know that voice!" They stood silent, and almost breathless under the shade of the same sugar-tree where Mrs. Lindall had once before watched and waited. The tones of the flute had died away, and soft low words were breathed in their place. Faith comprehended them, and could no longer be restrained.  With a bound she cleared the intervening space, entered the little enclosure, and a moment after was clasping the stranger in her loving arms. "Dear, lost Weenie!" she exclaimed. "I know you! I know you well enough! But "     21.0    BEi:NDING WILLOW. why have you come in disguise to the friends who love you so much?" "I came to speak to the chief," she replied, calmly. "Where is my adopted brother?" "White Cloud has gone to visit his kindred at Ottertail. He will be home in a day or two." "Weenie cannot wait! To-morrow's moon must find her beyond the springs of Minne Wakan." "But do you care nothing for me, dear Weenie? and do you not wish to see my father and mother? Go home with me now, and share my little room again! Some of the pictures you painted are still hanging on the walls." "The White Hand is a friend of the chief and of his people," she said, deliberately. "He is wise too, and may be trusted." "Of course he can be trusted," replied Faith. "If you have anything to tell him, he will be glad to listen, and more than glad that you place confidence in him."   A SURPRISE      2" "Bring him here then, with his dove-eyed woman, whom Weenie will never forget. The Dacotab cannot speak where there are strange ears to listen. She went to the home of the White Hand last night, but strangers were there. Strangers will not seek the grave of the M3edawe. Go, now, and leave the red maiden to speak to Listen-to-the-end." Faith went back to the spot where Miss Anthony and James West were waiting, and by signs and low whispered words, drew them away with her toward the mission. Nothing could exceed the surprise of Mr. and Mrs. Lindall at Faith's revelation; and, when informed that Weenie wished to speak with them, they went in haste to the well-known place, and greeted her with all the warmth and kindness of their really kind natures. We have never ceased to miss you, and to speak of you," said Mrs. Lindall, holding one of her hands in both her own. "But you have grown more than Faith, and I would never have 'known you in this dress."     212     BENDING WILLOW. "No," said Weenie, smiling. "No one knows the Dacotah now. It is good. But she heard the,voice of Neenaka night after night, calling after her, and the spirit of the Medawe beckoned her to come and speak a word to her adopted brother. He is not here!" "No," replied Mr. Lindall; "I am sorry White Cloud is absent; but he will soon be home."  "The White Hand& can whisper the Daco- tah's words in his ears when he comes. Tell him Wahtoga, his ancient foe, is dead; but his nephew, the son of Chasca has his scalp- lock braided now, and burns to avenge his father's death. He has led his young men on his fiist war-path, away to the Upper Missis- sippi, and when yonder night-sun dwindles and darkens with age, he will sound his war- whoop here by the Lake of the Great Spirit. Weenie has come in secret to bid White Cloud be wary, since it is his scalp the young tDacotah covets. Tell him too that his sister's   A SURPRISE       213 blood will be the price of her warning if it reaches young Chasca's ears." "Stay with us then," interrupted Faith, with an outhurst of tears. "No one will dare harm you here, good, brave Weenie." "Weenie is a Dacotah, and loves her own people," she replied, with a touch of her old decision. "But she remembers the words of the White Hand, and has rooted revenge from her heart. She would like to see the nations dwell together in peace, and the good, Great Spirit smiling alike upon all." "Weenie has heard the voice of the hea- venly Teacher," said Mrs. Lindall, tenderly; "the same voice that spoke to Listen-to-the- end, and whispered comfort to Neenaka be- fore she went to dwell with spirits. She will one day become the teacher of her people." "No," said the red girl, emphatically; "Weenie cannot teach herself. Who then would listen to her? She quarrels with her brother and cousins when they taunt her as Pillager, and is ready to fight whoever calls     214     BENDING WILLO W. the Ojibwas dead dogs or pale-faces. She will never remember the soft whispers of spirits." Something in the tone of her voice provoked a smile even from the grave missionary, with whom, as well as with his wife and daughter, the petulant, impulsive Dacotah had always been an object of uncommon interest. "You must go home with us to-night," he said; "I have many things to say to you, and many questions to ask respecting your own home and people. But tell me first, did you make this long journey alone?" "There were stars over her head at night, and blossoms under her feet by day. Birds were singing in the forest paths. Weenie was never alone." "You are braver than Pocahontas, my child, and have done a deed as noble as hers. White Cloud will be grateful; stay and let him thank you." "Weenie will have no thanks,' she replied. "The sister of Chasca will be missed, and some cowardly dog will scent her track. He   A SURPRISE.      215 will go to her father's grave by the Blue Earth, and seeing no offering there, will say, 'Bend- ing Willow has spoken to her people with a forked tongue.' Weenie must go again to the land of the Dacotahs. She will find her gar- ments where she hid them in the Ko-ko's  tree, when she put on her brother's finery, and took in her hand the flute he plays when he woos the fair maidens of his tribe." "But you are lame, my poor child," said Mrs. Lindall, compassionately. "Your steps were once as swift as a deer's." "See," said she, pulling off one of the heavy deer-skin moccasins which hid her little feet, and shaking from it a quantity of earth and pebbles-" the maiden is fleet still when it suits her purpose. She will run like a hunted fox to-morrow, and whoever seeks her the third day, may find her sitting by the grave of Chasca." Whenl they found that neither arguments nor entreaties would induce the resolute * Ko-ko-An owl.     216     BENDING WILLOW. girl to remain with them even for that night, Mrs. Lindall went away to the mission, and soon returned, bringing a basket filled with food, and a few trifling keepsakes; among them the box of water-colors, which had formerly afforded the children so much amuse- ment. She knew  Weenie would recognize them at once. Faith took from her pocket a pretty needle-book, furnished with thread, scissors and thimble, a gift she had lately received from the East, -and prized above all her other presents. "I am going to give you my beautiful needle-case, Weenie," she said, "because you know how to sew, and will like it better than anything else I have. It has my name marked inside. And, O Weenie! when will you ever come again?" "When Weenie sees a cloud hang over the Spirit Lake, or hears the voices of her friends calling to her again through the darkness, she will come like the swift wind. The Ddc6tah has no token to leave with her friends but these words." 7             A SURPRISE       217 Often in the days and years that succeeded, were Weenie's parting words recalled and repeated by the good missionaries of Silver Lake, 'and very often did Faith and her mother drop a tear at the remembrance of the little fantastic figure, that glided away from them into the forest alone, that pleasant midsummer-night.  /:* 3/     XX. GIVING UP THE OALPSa. EENIE'S warning came in good time, and, very fortunately, was not un- heeded. As soon as White Cloud returned, Mr. Lindall communicated to him the information she had given, and measures were at once taken to place the village under a strict guard. All the braves of the tribe rallied around their chief and begged to be led on the open war-path. But White Cloud determined to followf the coun- sels of the wiser old men, and act only on the defensive. On every path of approach to the lake an ambuscade was planted, with a preconcerted signal to convey intelligence to the village, where the chief and elder warriors (218)   GIVING UP THE SCALPS.    219 were assembled in the"war-lodge. The young 'trader and his two associates, with the love of adventure natural to youth, would not be restrained from joining the belligerants. Three nights passed without alarm; but toward the morning of the fourth, the sharp barking of a wolf was heard distinctly by every watcher. "Hooh!" was the instantaneous response. "They come on the sand-hill path! The zolves are on their track." A moment after, another cry like a night- hawk sounded from a different direction. "Hooh! hooh!" said the listeners. "The hawl7cs will pounce on them too. The skulkers come in two bands. We are ready for them." The warriors were quickly divided into two parties, and following the direction of each signal. Before day-dawn, the savage war- whoop was heard for the first time by the waters of the peaceful lake. The invaders, instead of surprising White Cloud's village, were themselves surprised and driven off a     220    BENDING WILLZOW. in great confusion with the loss of several of their number. The chief's party pursued them, and did nlot return until they were beyond the borders of the. Chippewa country. He lost no men, but two of his number were wounded and brought home on litters. One of these was James West, who had insisted on accompanying the chief, and whose inex- pertness in skulking, had rendered him a conspicuous mark. The enemy left behind five men, three killed, and two wounded. The latter, Mr. Lindall, with some difficulty, rescued from their captors and treated with the greatest kindness and humanity, binding up their wounds, and employing every effort in his power for their comfort and recovery. Tile former, in accordance with savage custom, but much to the grief of the good missionary, had been scalped, and one of their scalps was hanging from the belt of the chief. Mr. Lindall insisted on the burial of these poor victims, but not an Ojibwa was found willing to   GIVING UP THE SCALPS.   221 assist him until the return of White Cloud. By his instruction, the bodies were conveyed to a grove of pines some distance down the lake. The missionary accompanied them, and a long train of old men and young followed, out of sheer curiosity, all in war-paint' and feathers, as if for a merry-making. After the bodies were placed in the ground, Mr. Lindall addressed the spectators: "My friends, I am glad to see that you no longer feel vindictive toward these poor young men, who came to do you harn. You have not left their bodies to the 'ravens and vultures, but have brought them here to a pleasant grove beside your beautiful lake. The Great Spirit, who makes his sun to rise on the evil as well as the good, will be pleased with you for this. But there is one thing you have not done, though I am sure you will do it now, and thus become an example to your enemies. "When we go back to the village to-night,     222     BENDING WILLOW. and say to the wounded Dacotahs: 'Your brothers have been laid to sleep beside our pleasant lake with their scalps on their heads,' will not their hearts grow tender and soft toward you? And should they live to carry the story back to their people, will not they say: 'The brave Ojibwas are no longer our enemies. Let us live in peace ' "Brethren, listen to the words of your teacher, and bring the scalps you have taken and bury them, and bury with them the memory-of the wrong these poor young men would have done you." No one knew better than Mr. Lindall how much he demanded when he asked an Indian to give up the scalp of an enemy. It was asking more than any toil and privation; it was taking from him the proof of his prowess, the badge of his renown. Without it, he could never touch the red war-stake, nor be crowned in the stirring victory-dance. One of the victors in the recent fight was a young man who had never worn an eagle's   GIVING UP rTE SCALPS.   223 4 feather. From the moment he secured his trophy, his heart swelled with pride at the thought of wearing this badge of the warrior. While the missionary was speaking, his coun- tenance fell, and his hand grasped uncon- sciously his treasure. He had no thought of yielding it, however, until he saw White Cloud, who wore another of the bloody trophies, take it from his belt, whilst he said: "Brothers! never has the White Hand spoken to the Ojibwas falsely! Never has he hid his face in the hour of danger, or coun- selled cowardice. But for his whispered words, the fierce Dacotahs would have found us in our beds at midnight, and spilled our blood like water. When he tells us the Great Spirit would have the Ojibwas set an example of mercy to the nations, he knows what he says. He only repeats the words of Listen- to-the-end, who was the wisest of his tribe, and who read the future with an open eye. Bro- thers, our kindred, who have been sent on the Road of Souls, do not need these young men     224    BENDING WILLO W. to attend them. We will give them their scalps again, and let them go and rejoin the spirits of their own relatives." With these words, White Cloud advanced, and dropped his trophy into the open grave. The cheeks of young Ossewa glowed like flame as he listened to the words of his brave leader. Twice he drew the scalp from his belt, and returned it, as though he were not equal to the sacrifice. Not a word was spoken, but the eyes of every young man of the nation were upon him. He was a general favorite, the same youth who had put his tobacco- pouch and red stone pipe in the old Medawe's grave. Most of-the braves sympathized with Ossewa in his reluctance, and sincerely hoped he would not yield his trophy. He could read this in their faces. But when he turned to the chief, the countenance of White Cloud said nothing; i not a word, yea nor nay, until the moment of indecision was past. Then, when following his own example, the young man advanced   GTiING UP THE SCALPS.    225 and-ropped his scalp on the head of his vic- tim, saying, in soft accents, "Tonga may go in peace," the face of the chief beamed with satisfaction. And whef the youth drew near him again, he plucked a feather from his own chaplet and placed it in Ossewa's fillet. The other victor was Black Adder. All the malignity of his name seemed stamped on his features while he listened to the exhortation of the missionary, and marked the subsequent action of White Cloud. And when Ossewa, imitating the action of his: chief, let fall his scalp, a sharp hiss of derision fell from his lips, and mingled with the fainter demonstra- tions of applause. The sound attracted the gaze of every one to the angry old warrior. His eyes were like burning coals, as he drew the third scalp from his girdle, and flourished it defiantly over his head, exclaiming: "Wasaota is waiting for you! Go, dog, and be a slave forever." Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away in the direction of the 15 "I.},               226     BENDING WILLOW village. From that hour Black Adder cher- ished a secret, but decided ill-will against the missionaries, whom he had barely tolerated from the first. The wound of the young trader proved more severe than was 4t first anticipated. Inflam- mation ensued, and, for several days, both limb and life were in jeopardy. But an excellent con- stitution, assisted by judicious treatment and unremitting care on the part of Mr. Lindall, averted the danger. He was soon able to re- turn to his post again, areal hero now in the eyes of every Ojibwa. One of the wounded prisoners rallied also, and was slowly-recovering. The other sur- vived but a few days, and was laid beside his comrades. It was a great mystery to the Pillagers by what means White Cloud had learned the proximity of the enemy, since he and Mr. Lin- dall, for reasons which will be explained, wise- ly concluded to keep the truth a profound secret. Some of the more credulous affirmed   GivINa UP THE SCALPS.    227 that the spirit of Listen-to-the-end had been back in the guise of a strange youth to fore- warn him. Others, that he obtained, the in- formation from an old "Futurity-glass man" while at Ottertail, and hastened home to pre- pare the ambuscades. While many more believed that their new teacher conversed with spirits as really as the old Medawe. The words of the chief at the burial of the Dacotahs confirmed them in this belief; and no one credited it more fully than the wounded prisoner, who, by the missionary's interposition and aid, had been treated with such unexpected kindness. No' danger to the heroic Weenie was therefore to be apprehended through him, if set at liberty; and fears for her safety had been the. true reason for con- cealing so carefully the name of their real informant. Her own words to the mission- ary had suggested this caution: "His sister's blood will be the price of her warning if it reach Chasca's ears." But among themselves, the mission family     228    BENDING WILLOW. never wearied of speaking of the brave girl and her dangerous errand, and of what the conse- quences to themselves and the lake-people might have been, but for her timely warning. Whenever the chief joined them, the conver- sation reverted to the same theme, and his praises were meted out as lavishly as their own. "The little Dacotah has proved herself as brave as she is proud," he said. "White Cloud likes her spirit. He will send back the "ittle Chief,' with a gift for Neenaka's fondling. Bright Eyes has a pony that will make the maiden's heart glad." Though appreciating as highly as any one the heroism of Weenie, and the service she had rendered them, West did not much like this allusion to the fine young horse he had purchased on his last visit to the fort, and which he was training with great care for a special purpose.  But Faith was delighted.  o So it would /" she exclaimed. "And what funny tricks s   GIVING UP THE SCALPS.   229 Weenie would teach it too. I wish James would let you have it for her." "So I would, if it were my own," he replied; "but I bought it for another person." Faith regarded him closely and steadily. She thought, for the first time, he was practising a deception, rather than part with his pet. The trader observed her serious look and the doubt that lay behind it. His eyes overflowed with mirth, as he replied: 'I bought Pet for a-young lady, whom I found one day shedding 'salt tears for old Beshike, a little the ugliest animal I ever saw. If she will agree to wait until another pony can be found, you may take it on your own terms, chief." A look of joyful surprise chased away the doubt. "Did you really buy Pet for me, James, just because I was silly enough to cry about poor old Beshike? I am very much obliged to you, but I would rather Weenie should have it than to have it myself. She has very few     230    BENDING WILLOW. pleasures, you know, and I have a great many." So it was decided that White Cloud should send the beautiful pony to the brave girl who came so far to save his life. Little Chief was soon able to set out on his journey. When informed that he was to be released and sent home, he was touched with gratitude, and replied:' "Little Chief will never come again as an enemy to the country of White Cloud. He loves the chief and all the pale-faces. He will dull any hatchet that is whetted for their blood. And he will never again vex his cousin, the Bending Willow, by deriding the Ojibwas." "Bending Willow was my mother's child," returned the chief. "She dwelt in her wig- wam many years, and when she went away to her own people, Neenaka's heart was broken. It is many moons since White Cloud has seen his little sister, but he has not forgotten her. He will send her a gift by the hand of her   GIVIN UP THE SCALPS.    231 cousin. Little Chief will bear it safely and say, 'White Cloud remembers his mother's child.'" White Cloud dared not say more for fear of the treachery of his messenger, and his prisoner departed, never dreaming his young cousin's foot-prints had not yet faded from the long forest paths he was about to tread.     CHANGES. E have now to pass over an interval' of many years, during which very !    remarkable chan'ges have taken place in the far West.  All along the Northern Mississippi, towns and cities have sprung up as by magic, and the valley of the Minnesota is dotted thickly with traces of civilization. The blue lakes reflect many cabin homesteads in place of the ancient wigwams, and prairie trails are hidden by fields of 'heat and Indian corn. Government has cut roads and built bridges from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains; eiigra- tion has followed, and the red man's domain M232)   CHANiv ES.      233 has dwindled from wide territories to limited reservations. Many teachers have followed in the foot- steps of Paul Lindall, and mission schools anc mission churches have been multiplied. But none of them grew so quietly, or thrust their roots so vigorously into the native soil, as our mission at Silver Lake. From the first, the Lake Indians, with few exceptions, were kindly disposed, and even grateful to the missionaries for their self-denying labors; and when they saw the pretty white-walled chapel looking out from the sugar-trees, where for- merly the lonely lodge of the Medawe had stood, and the neat cottage of the White Hand, embowered in vines and surrounded with flowers, and the modest school-house where the little ones of the tribe gathered daily, they were very proud of them. And they were prouder still of their grand trading- post in the midst of the village where the hunters and trappers of distant bands came laden with their forest spoils to take (     234    BENDING WILLOW. back warmth and comfort to their wig- wams. "The name of "Bright Eyes" has been 'wafted even farther through the forest than that of the "White Hand." He is talked of among the Indians as a great magician, who somewhere away in the region of the rising ,un has a house of gold, and speaks words that many heed. White Cloud has been thither once with the good missionary, and was led through forests of wigwams larger than were ever seen. He ate from glittering dishes, and drank from a shining cup, which he brought back to the Lake of the Great Spirit as a memorial. The little maiden, who used to paddle the Wild Goose with the young Dacotah, and dance over the white rifts on old Neenaka's snow-shoes, dwelt there in the "house of gold," with little ones around her, and one of them was named, for her long-lost playmate, Weeneonka. This is only an Indian story you know, but it has a meaning very easily interpreted.   wHA NOES.      235 I will trust my young readers to do this, and save me the trouble of writing it out here. But there are other things, not as pleasant, which I will have to tell them. While some things were thus happily pro- gressing and prospering, Black Adder had become an old man; and, I am sorry to say, had not profited much either by faithful teachings, or pious examples. He had never in his heart liked the missionaries, and, from year to year, grew more and more jealous of their influence lover the minds of the young men in turning them aside from the war-path, and from the traditions of their race. He was also jealous of the white settlers who were scattering all over the country, and nursed many secret plans for their extermina- tion. Only the fear of White Cloud, who was the declared friend of the settlers as well as of the missionaries, prevented him from be- coming an open enemy. But while he dared not act in direct violation of the pledged faith of his chief, he     236     BENDING WILLOW. cherished his ill-will in secret, and strove continually to stir up the minds of the young men by reciting deeds of daring adventure when their fathers were a race of men and warriors, instead of "old women," as he contemptuously called the mission Indians. And he never neglected an opportunity of deriding their attempts at agriculture and industry. So, although he' was now an old man, and the oldest warrior left in the whole band, he was not too old to rais6 dissension, or incite to mischief. Time and circumstance as often favor the machinations of the evil as the better designs of the good; and both now seemed conspiring to aid Black Adder. The summer of 1862 opened darkly for the whole Northwest. The flower of her young men had forsaken their peaceful pursuits and gone to the war. Her forts were desolated, the garrisons all gone, swallowed up in the grand armies of the Republic. Rumors of the terrible strife penetrated the remotest forests,   CHANGES.       237 and men everywhere held their breath for tidings. The missionaries of Silver Lake were as much interested in the grand struggle as the dwellers by the Hudson, or Connecticut. How could it be otherwise? The moral effect of the war upon the red men was in the highest degree pernicious. Incapable of judging it by any standard higher than their own, they were everywhere ready to say-"Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that sayest, tze must not go to war and kill our brethren, do you do the same?"The argument was unanswerable, and the disheartened missionaries could only reply, "Our brothers have forgotten the words of the heavenly Teacher." The answer was unsatisfactory. Murmurs of discontent weie heard on every hand. The  young men began to neglect their employment, and were often seen conferring with Black Adder, who loved their chief almost as little as he loved the whites. Parties of them were frequently absent for days together, and     238    BENDING WILLOW. i returned without game or booty. White Cloud harangued them in vain. Low mutterings took the place of their old cheerful responses; and the chief became moody and silent. The school still flourished under the man- agement of Miss Anthony, assisted by two native teachers, orphans, whom the Lindalls had adopted and educated to fill their daugh- ter's vacant place. The women of the tribe were as industrious as ever, but few of the men labored now, or gathered, as heretofore, to listen to the teacher, who had grown old among them, and who, for more than twenty years, had left them but for a single season. Something was wrong, something which neither the Lindalls nor their associates in the mission could pene- trate. One morning White Cloud appeared at the door of the mission house, mounted on his fleetest horse. Mr. Lindall went out, and the two conferred together in a low tone. Mrs. Lindall heard him say:   airANmES.      239 "My young men are away, listening to evil counsellors. I must join them, but will come again when the excitement is quelled. Keep a sharp eye on Black Adder. Though old, he has not lost his teeth. He is full of venom; but his head shall be crushed if necessary." "What can, he mean?" thought Mrs. Lin- dall. "Alice, dear, what do you suppose is in the wind?" and she repeated as much as she had overheard of the chief's remarks. "I think," she replied, "that the Ojibwas are bent on the war-path, and that old Black Adder incites them. James said, before he left the last time, he was filling the young men with dissatisfaction and disaffection. Every rumor that reaches them from the East, renders them more bloodthirsty. I begin to fear that the red men in the mass may prove not very unlike Esop's cat, which was trans- formed into a damsel, and who behaved her- self very properly until a mouse crossed her path, when she sprang upon it like a tigress. The Indian instinct is for war, and it will take     240     BENDING WILLOW. a great deal of grace to overcome it when the temptation is before them." Alice Anthony was a shrewd, clear-sighted woman, and neither her love for the red men nor her desire to do them good was able to blind her. While Mr. and Mrs. Lindall would have staked their lives on the integrity of their beloved Ojibwas, there were times when she distrusted them altogether, and was ready to despair of their thorough civilization, or Christianization. Mr. Lindall returned to his study with a weary, troubled look. Alice's eyes followed him, but she forbore to ask any questions. Had she done so, he had no more to com- municate than his wife had already overheard. There was nothing ske could do, therefore, but watch, and wait, aid pray.   XXII. A SECOND SURPRISE. T  WO nights after, Miss Anthony was lying half-asleep and half-awake, her thoughts all in confusion. A letter, which she had received from. Faith that day, contributed to her uneasi- ness, and was strangely in harmony with her own feelings. I do not like my dreams of home," Faith wrote. "Al the terrible battles I read of are transferred in my slumbers to Silver Lake. White Cloud is leader of the armies of the Union, and old Black Adder of the forces of the Rebellion. I am there, a child again, but always lost and bewildered. 16       (241)     242    BENDING WILLOW. James laughs at me whenever I tell him, but I cannot help wishing you were all here with me." Alice pondered this letter a long time before retiring, then fell asleep to dream of war-whoops and cannonading; awoke again to hear the wind and rain battling at her casement, and, in the pauses, a sound like a feeble rap at the outer door of the mission. At first, she believed it only a freak of her own imagination; but 'when she heard it repeated in another lull of the storm, she rose, determined to investigate. Her room was in front, communicating with the main entry. She had only to open her door, and the rapping became too distinct to admit of a doubt. Mrs. Lindall, whose slum- ber was always as light as a bird's, was at her side in a moment. "What is it, dear?" she inquired, anxiously. "Do you hear anything more than the wind and the rain?" "I heard a rap at th8 door," Alice returned.   A SE4COND SURPRISE.    243 "I think some one is ill in the village and has sent for you, perhaps." "I thought I heard something myself, and was just lighting a light when you opened your door. Does any one wish to enter?" she asked in a louder tone, putting her ear to the latch. "A friend is here," was the reply, in a voice almost too faint to be heard. There was no hesitation. The door was unbarred at once, and a woman entered or rather fell upon the threshold. The figure of a man was also dimly discernible, brt, a blast of wind at the moment extinguished the candle and all was darkness, Alice heard only a low moaning, as she went to her room to relight it. The woman had fallen through faintness and weariness, but a few minutes' care re- vived her, and revealed a stranger. She was a young woman, apparently, but wasted and attenuate. Her eyes were large and glowed like stars as they followed every motion /     244     BENDIING WILLOW. of Mrs. Lindall; and, when her husband entered tie room, a smile of satisfaction, or recognition, stole over the worn features. She appeared to have no strength to speak, but drank the milk which they held to her lips; and when it was gone, clasped Mrs. Lindall's hand, a very unusual demonstration for an Indian. They all regarded her atten- tively and inquiringly. "You no know me!" she said at last. "Where is the White Fawn?" Either this allusion to Faith, or something in the sound of the weak voice awakened old remembrances. "This cannot be Weenie!"Mr. Lindall said in a husky voice; " our Weenie, whom we have not seen nor heard from for so many long years?" She only smiled. Tears were chasing one another down Mrs. Lindall's pale cheeks as she held her hand, and said, "Poor sick Weenie." Mr. Lindall continued, "Faith has gone   A SECOND SURPRISE.    245 away from us, but she has not forgotten her old playmate of Silver Lake, who has a namesake in her new home; a gay little thing, to whom herl mother often tells stories of the Wild Goose, and the snow-shoes, and old Beshike." The woman smiled again, a soft, grateful smile, very touching to see. "Weenie called the pony her brother sent her Beshike, too," she said., "Poor Beshike! We had to leave him behind in the forest last night. He is getting old and blind, and his limbs could not even bear his mistress' light weight." "You did not come alone then?" returned Mrs. Lindall. "I am glad of that. But you are worn out, and shall have rest now." "Weenie's husband came with her. Her feet are too feeble for so long a journey now. But when she saw another cloud rising over the Lake of the Great Spirit, she remembered the words she left with her friends, and wished to make them good."     246    BEND1IN WILLOW. The missionaries regarded one another in silence. They too remembered those part- ing words. Had they reached their fulfil- ment? Were their presentiments true then? And did some real danger menace them? "I hope there is nothing very serious to apprehend, my good Weenie," Mr. Lindall said, reluctantly. "Are the Dacotahs on the war-track again?" ".Not the Dacotahs alone," she replied, with an energy suddenly aroused. "All the nations from the Red River of the South, to the Red River of the North, have joined hands to wipe out the pale-faces. Their old enmities are buried in a deep grave. The voice came up from the South first: 'Now is the time to avenge yourselves, and recover your old hunting-grounds. The great father at Washington has spoken to his children falsely. He means to starve them like dogs.'" "Are you certain of the truth of this, Weenie, quite certain?"Mr. Lindall asked, deliberately. "I cannot think our people   A SECOND SURPRISE.    247 here would be leagued for such a terrible purpose! I have known them too long and well." "Weenie knows it is true; and she knows that Black Adder has sent messages to Little Crow, that he has stolen the hearts of the young men from White Cloud, who is no better now than an old woman. Little Chief heard the words of the Ojilwa messengor^, and lifted his voice against them. He would have come alone to the Lake of the Great Spirit, and spoken to the friends who saved his life, but Weenie heard the voices of the departed calling her again, and she followed feebly. White Hand must go away to his own people until the bloody warriors have spent their rage." Mr. Lindall paced the room in evident agitation, unable and unwilling to believe the appalling report. His wife was less disturbed, or better concealed her anxiety, in her efforts to promote Weenie's comfort. Miss Anthony, meanwhile, was deliberating on what was to be     248     BENDIN  WILLOW. done, and as soon as it became clear to her own mind, she spake with her accustomed energy and decision. "I have no doubt of the truth of what this good woman has told us, nor of the wisdom of her advice. We must leave, and there is no time to lose. If we go away, the storm may blow over without blood; but if we remain, as I know your hearts feel inclined, White Cloud with a part of the band will be armed against the whole league, and their lives be sacrificed to no purpose. I am not exactly a coward, but do not feel inclined to have my scalp grace a savage victory-dance, if I can keep it on my head." "Wha t do you advise us to do then, Miss Alice?"Mr. Lindall inquired. "I have just said, we must leave the mis- sion; but let every white settler in the neigh- borhood be. warned first. The traders and the men at the farm will soon accomplish this, and we can all join company for mutual pro- tection. Go now, under cover of the night,   A SECOND SURPRISE.    249 and inform the men at the post. Black Adder's eyes are everywhere by day." "And his ears by night," remarked the In- dian woman, sententiously. "The storm will deaden them to-night," replied Miss Anthony. "But you must not delay nor hesitate thus, Mr. Lindall. To- morrow's midnight must find us on the trail to Snelling. Appoint a rendezvous, and insist upon all parties being there promptly. In the mean time we will do what little we can to make ready." The eyes of the three women followed Mr. Lindall as he took his hat and went forth into the night without a word. One of them, for some time, had observed how very rapidly he' was becoming aged; what deep traces his thirty years of faithful service had left upon him; but neither had ever before seen that look of utter weariness and despondeney. Amid all the trials and privations of his mis- sion labor, he had never before for a moment doubted of the final success of his work.      XXIII. THE ALARM. HE husband of Weenie was waiting without, with the natural shyness of his race, intensified by the con- sciousness of bearing unwelcome tid- ings. From the hour of his release from captivity, his heart had been softened toward White Cloud and his people, and filled with gratitude to the good missionary who had nursed him back to life, and saved his dead comrades from dishonor. Through his solicitations, teachers from the lower reser- vation had established themselves on the upper Minnesota, and a few converts had been made to the new faith.  For nearly a year, Little Chief had been (250)   THE ALARM       251 aware of the increasing disaffection among his countrymen, and of their evil intentions toward the white settlers; and in every meeting and council had lifted his voice against them. His cousin Paul, the best orator of the nation, and Standing Buffalo, one of the chiefs of Big Stone Lake, were also faithful friends of the whites, though they knew as well as Little Crow, or any of the unfriendly chiefs, what injustice had marked their recent treaties with the Federal Government, and what want and woe had resulted to the Incians from the failure to make the stipulated payments. But a nation's broken faith could not incite these noble natures to revenge on the innocent the fault of the guilty. And when Black Adder's messengers bore to Little Crow the intelligence that the Ojibwas were as dissatisfied as the Dacotahs, and that their young men were ready to join in a war of extermination, these faithful men harangued them boldly and be- sought for peace. "The Indians who talk of exterminating  -     252 .   BENDING WILLOW. the whites, must be asleep, or crazy," said the eloquent Paul. They have no idea what they are talking about. When you fight the whites, you fight thunder and lightning, and will all be killed. Your young men talk very boastingly, but they are cowards. They will run when they meet soldiers. They are only fit to murder women and children. Our young men will not join you. They will stay and' hunt the buffalo, while your little ones starve." The angry young men of the Dacotahs would have lilled Paul but for the protection of Standing Buffalo, a powerful chief of whom they stood in awe. "Paul is right," he said, " and my Indians will stand with him, and by him. If Little Crow wishes to see his young men hang in the air like dogs, let him strike the first blow. Meanwhile, my braves will shake hands with the whites and drive away every murderer from our reservation." This council revealed to the friendly Indians   THE ALARM.      253 the full extent of the plot, which had for its end and aim nothing less than the total extinc- tion of the whites in the Northwest. Messen- gers from the Winnebagoes and Ojibwas were present, with assurances that both nations were ready for a general uprising, and that the great chief, Hole-in-the-day, had as many war- riors as there were leaves on the trees, all eager to fight. At the conclusion of the council the friendly chiefs conferred apart, and pledged themselves to protect their missionaries and traders at all- hazards; and one of their number said: "Little Chief will carry a message to the land of White Cloud. Every night the ear of Bending Willow hears voices fromkthe Lake of the Great Spirit, but her steps are too feeble and slow now to follow on the long trail. Her husband will go alone and say to the good teachers there, 'A storm is gathering! Fly to the shelter of the big guns.'" When Weeneonka heard the determination of her husband, she resolved to accompany     254     BENDING WILLOW.  him, and all his arguments could not shake her purpose. "The summer flowers are blossoming on the grave of Listen-to-the-end," she said, " the rarest flowers that Bending Willow and the White Fawn could find in the forest. I see them when I lie down at night, and I hear the blue-birds singing in the sugar-trees, and the soft waters lapping the sands of the Silver Lake. They call me back to the grave of the Medawe. They say, 'Rest here while the soul goes away to the Spirit land in search of the departed. Weenie will go with her chief to the country of White Cloud. Beshike has not forgotten the way, and will bear his mistress thither.'" When Mr. Lindall opened the door of his dwelling he found Little Chief seated on the threshold, regardless of the storm. "Come in," said the missionary, taking his extended hand. "Come in and dry your blanket by the fire we have just lighted. The Dacotah has travelled far and is welcome."   TME ALARM.       255 "The summer rain has no chill," replied the Indian. "It is soft and refreshing. Little Chief came to speak to White Cloud of a blacker storm than this, and to warn the friends who saved his life. Where is the teacher going at midnight?" "To whisper in the ears of his white breth- ren the words which his red friends came so far to bring. The night is propitious." "It is good," replied Little Chief. "Tell them the heart of the Dacotah is heavy with the tidings he brings, but that his friendship is unshaken. He has not forgotten the hand that fed him when he was hungry, and spared his life when he was guilty. But . the young men of his nation are all on fire, incited by a few wicked old warriors. The Ojibwa young men are no better.  They too have evil counsellors, and their great Mississippi chief * will soon lead a mighty host to sweep' the country from the Red River of the North to the Falls of St. Anthony. Such are the words that * "Hole-in-the-day."     256     BENDIYG' WILLOW. Black Adder sends to Little Crow and Shaka- pee." An inky darkness overspread that summer night, but all the paths of the village were perfectly familiar to Mr. Lindall, who had trodden them by night and day for nearly a quarter of a century. His steps were directed toward the trading-post, now in charge of one of West's younger brothers and two or three clerks, whose sleeping apartments were in a wing of the building. Little Chief followed closely at his heels, but his tread was lighter than a cat's. The sharpest ear could not have detected his foot-falls. A bird in the air would have made more noise than he. Mr. Lindall might have reached out his arm and touched him -at any moment, yet never suspected his presence until he stood beside him on the porch, and laid his hand on his in the darkness, with a suddenness that made him shudder. "The night has ears, if no, eyes," he whis- pered, "and they cannot be trusted. My Do   THE ALARM.       257 brother has not learned to be secret. His step is like the buffalo's, and his hand, in arousing his friends, would startle the spies of Black Adder from their midnight slumbers. The Dacotah hears footsteps in the distance! Listen!" Mr. Lindall did listen, but could hear nothing more than the soft patter of the rain, and the dripping eaves. "They  are approaching," Little Chief continued, " but too carelessly for an Indian! I smell tobacco in the air." The quick senses of the Indian were not in fault. The footsteps drew nearer and nearer, and the scent of the tobacco was soon per- ceptible even to Mr. Lindall. It was one of the young traders, who had been spending the even- ing down the lake and had waited thus late for a pause in the storm. The light of his cigar revealed his features as he ascended the steps. "Don't be alarmed, Harry, to find us here at this hour," said the missionary, " but let us in without questioning." 17     258     BENDING WILLOW. The door was unlocked in haste, and the three entered together. "Though not an advocate for late hours in general, I am glad to find you up to-night," said Mr. Lindall. "Our friend here has come all the way from Big Stone Lake to tell us that the Indians are preparing for a general up- rising. This accounts for the perverseness of our young men, and the uneasiness of the chief, who still lingers at their summer en- campment. Black Adder's messengers are in frequent counsel with the Dacotahs, and promise the aid of Hole-in-the-day and all his warriors. They are only awaiting some trifling pretext to begin their work." "That certainly sounds badly," replied the young man; "but I think it will all end in smoke. Black Adder is bad enough to do anything; but Hole-in-the-day appears to me too intelligent to commit any such blunder. He must know that the first stroke he makes will be the death-knell of his nation." "The Indians believe that the government   THE ALARM.      259 has alreadymore on its hands than it can dispose of," rejoined Mr. Lindall, "and that now is their golden opportunity to revenge the wrongs of years. Poor afflicted race  how gladly would I save you!" "You have already saved many, my dear sir, and I have no doubt will save many more. I don't feel like running yet." "I do not feel like running away either; yet it will not do to slight admonitions of danger. It is better to be over-cautious than over-bold, and, although I would prefer to die here at my post to living elsewhere, my life is not my own to sacrifice. Should White Cloud not return before to-morrow night, we must start for Snelling, or St. Paul. How many of the boys are here to-night?" "They are all in, sir." "It will be very easy then for us to give the alarm to the settlers, who should be warned without delay, as some few hours will be necessary for preparation. Let the place of rendezvous be Muddy Creek where it     260    BENDING WIL LOW. crosses the lower prairie trail; the hour for starting, midnight." "A number of young persons are spending the night at the farm on account of the storm, which would have detained me also, but for letters to send off in the morning by one of the boys, who starts for the East. I will return there myself, while you go back to the mission and obtain what rest you can. Harley Jones has half a dozen horses, you know, and the settlements are all in one direction. Every man shall be warned by sunrise." It was evident to Harry West that Mr. Lindall's strength was unequal to the shock he had received, and that, unless he could gain a little rest and composure, he would never endure the fatigue and excitement of the long journey; so with a good deal of his elder brother's tact and energy, and a little of his love of adventure, perhaps, he promised to do everything himself on condition the mis- sionary would remain at home, and be ready to confer with White Cloud, who might be   THE ALARM.      261 expected at any moment, if affairs were as bad as represented. Thus Mr. Lindall was persuaded. !"Harry is a noble, generous boy! and although he cares less for books than for sport now, he will make as good a man as his brother, in time." With these reflections, he returned slowly to the mission, followed by the silent Da- cotah. I'     XXIV. THE FLIGHT. EFORE noon of the next day, every i'J) settler in the country of White Cloud had heard the warning of Little Chief and Bending Willow, and there was a rushing in wild haste from farm to farm to inquire what such tidings purported, and what action should be taken. The settlers were divided in sentiment. Some, doubting the report, were in favor of remaining, and, if worse came to worse, acting in concert with the friendly Indians,. and fighting for their homes and harvest. Others, in view of the women and helpless little ones, urged immediate flight; and as the latter were a decided majority, preparations (262)   THE FLIGHT.      263 wore made without loss of time. Before the appointed hour, a dozen homesteads were sadly left behind, and more than forty persons assembled at the place of rendezvous, some on foot, but the greater number with horsel and farm-wagons laden with provision and  clothing. Harry West's "prairie schooner," as he called his large canvas-covered wagon, had two stout horses attached to it, and bore not only the mission family, but as many more of the pedestrians as its spacious sides could hold. The Lindalls took sufficient for the journey, leaving everything else behind for their weeping orphans, and for the comfort of the feeble, faithful Weenie. Harry was the life of the drooping company, and, if we except the brave Miss Alice, almost the only life and light it had that dark, sorrowful night. Though advising the removal of the women and children, he did not decide to abandon the field himself until the arrival of White Cloud that same evening.     264    BENDING WILLOW. The good chief shook his head mournfully when he spoke of remaining. "The young men all over the country are crazy," he said, "and no one can restrain them. J They have built a huge war-lodge and are dancing and feasting night and day with their former enemies. No one can tell what they will do. Go to the shelter of the big guns, my son, and come again when the war-cloud is removed. White Cloud will guard the property of Bright Eyes with his own lice. He will see no, happiness until his friends return to make his heart glad. Go, and as soon as the foolish young men forget the counsels of Black Adder, and return to their hunting and their harvest, their chief will send a swift messenger to the White Hand, who has cheered our sick and buried our dead, and to the brother of Bright Eyes, who feeds and warms us through the winter snows." "Take my keys, good chief," said Harry, "and do not let any one suffer while we are   t1HE FLIGHT.     265 away. The wives and children of the lazy vagabonds who have followed Black Adder must not be left to starve. Tell them the white trader left them food. Above all, see that the poor Dacotah woman and her hus- band want nothing. As for yourself, my friend, be wary. The old Adder loves you as he loves the white people. It would do me good to bruise his head before I leave." "It would have been done long ago, but for the words of the missionary," replied the chief, with another shake of the head. "He says the swords of the good Master are, 'Thou shalt not kill;' and these words go ringing in the ears of White Cloud whenever he lays his hand on the tomahawk. It is better to be called a coward than to offend the Master of Life." "No one will ever doubt your courage, brave chief," replied Harry, grasping his hand with energy; "and you are a much better Christian than I am at this moment     266     BENDING WILLOW. May God bless you! Mr. Lindall is now waiting impatiently for you at the mission: It was a mournful cavalcade that went stretching southward over the prairie-trail that sultry August night. If flowers bloomed in the path of the fugitives, they did not see them. If the summer stars were singing " as they shone," in their glittering constellations, they could not hear them. It seemed as if all the beauty and the music of God's world had forsaken it. The thoughts of most of the poor travellers dwelt sadly on the pleasant homes they had reared in the wilderness, and abandoned to desolation; or turned from these to the savage tomahawk that thirsted for their blood. But every lip was silent; not a heart revealed its terror or its grief by outward sign. Mr. Lindall was the saddest of any. All the long years he had dwelt there in the wilderness passed rapidly through his mind with their changing lights and shadows. It seemed but yesterday since he first sat, a   THE FLIGHT.      267 stranger, in the cabin of the youthful chief, while old Neenaka and her little foster-child welcomed him  and gave him food. Only yesterday that he bent his ear to the tales of Listen-to-the-end, and told him in return the story of the Soof f God. How high his heart beat thbn with youth and hope, and how much, with the strength of, God, he aimed to accomplish! Now his head was white as the almond tree, and his life was almost spent. Had he not labored faithfully all these years? What fruit could he show in his forest field? Only a few graves planted in hope, and possibly a little tender seed in the hearts of the living. Much of the early blossom had proved a false show. Few of his converts, when the hour of trial came, were found among the faithful, and these few devoted ones he was forced to abandon when they needed him most. Such thoughts were in his mind continually during the first hours of their journey, ren- dering him silent and despondent. His wife,     268     BENDING WILLO W. with saint-like patience; held his hand fast in her own, turning away her head whenever a tear fell for her poor adopted children, or at thought of Weenie, whom she expected to see no more. Even gay Harry West was moved at the sight of so much tenderness and devo- tion, and he whispered to Miss Anthony. "What can we do? It is time to break this spell. Shall we laugh or sing?" "Laughter would be only a mockery," she replied. "Raise a hymn, and call out to the others to join us. It is always better to follow God's ways singing than weeping. Strike up old Jordan and Mr. Lindall will forget even his beloved Indians for a time." Miss Alice was right. Before they had finished the first stanza, the rich tenor of the missionary's voice was heard, low at first, but rising louder and clearer to the end; and it was his voice that repeated the closing lines: "No chilling wind nor poisonous breath Can reach that peaceful shore; Sickness and sorrow, pain and death Are felt and feared no more."   THE FLIGHT.      269 A momentary pause succeeded, when one of the young men, from a wagon behind, began to sing again:    .i "If you get there before I do, -I'm bound for the land of Canaan!" Another and another caught the refrain, and so they went singing on through the darkness of that wretched night, cheered and comforted. The prairie was crossed, and they entered the pine-wood at break of day. Timorous mothers now folded their arms more closely around their sleeping babes in expectation of soie lurking foe or stinging arrow. But no airow came; no foe molested them. They journeyed on undisturbed, camping by forest streams at night, and gathering berries and wild plums by day, until at the end of a week, they hailed with great joy the rocky ramparts and starry flag of Fort Snelling, at the mouth of the Minnesota. It was the 26th of August, a day of great confusion at the fort. As they drew near, they saw a party of mounted horsemen issue     270    BENDING WILL O V. from the sally-port and gallop away over the prairie, as though life depended on their speed. And when the post was reached they heard tidings to make the stoutest heart faint. The outbreak had already commenced on the Upper Minnesota. Hundreds of the peaceful settlers there had been wantonly massacred, and hundreds more led away to a fate worse than death. Fugitives were pouring down the valley by thousands, with wails of lamen- tation and despair, and the land was full of mourners who refused to be comforted. The Silver Lake party listened and turned pale when they reflected what might have been their own fate but for the faithful Weenie and her husband. . Twice had this heroic creature travelled over the wide waste which lay between her own country and that of the Ojibwas, to save the friends of her childhood, though of another race and nation. Who will say that gratitude and humanity are wholly wanting in the red race, when they read this record of Bending Willow?   xxV. GOING HOME. UUR tale is almost ended. The Indian war of the Northwest has already its faithful chronicler and its bloody page in history. Its details are too painful to be revived here, and too fresh to require it. The war was followed by cries of extermination on every hand, extermination of the whole red race, the innocent as well as the guilty. The ears of the good missionaries were constantly assailed by these cries, and their hearts were full of anguish for their poor forest children, whose offences they sought not to justify, and whose offenders they would not have screened. But for the guiltless and helpless, those with whom they had lived, (271)     272    BENDING WILLOW. labored and suffered, their lips, as well as their hearts, made most earnest appeal' Mr. and Mrs. Lindall had proceeded directly to New York. Faith and her husband sought by every means in their power to divert them from their great sorrow and disappointment, but the grief of Mr. Lindall lay too deep for earthly healing. It had entered into his heart and was wasting his life. As the winter wore on, his restlessness in- creased, and his desira to return to his red children grew stronger and stronger. "Let me go and be laid with them, when my work is done," he said, entreatingly. And they promised him, when the winter was past, he should return to his people. "Faith, will come some day, and show her little ones where the early Passover-flowers blossomed when she and Weenie were children!"He laid his thin hand caressingly on the head of little Paul, and added, with greater earnest- ness, "And, O, my children, if God spares his life, make an Indian missionary of my   GOING HOME.      273 namesake here, and let him finish the work which his grandsire only began." All winter Mr. Lindall labored unweariedly at his translations, fully determined to return to the Lake with the opening of navigation. James promised to accompany him and ascer- tain the real disposition of the Indians, leav- ing the ladies of the mission behind to await their report. Mrs. Lindall gazed on her husband in sorrowful silence whenever this arrangement was mentioned, hiding her thoughts and fears in her own breast. Miss Anthony was with her friends in Phil- adelplia, but ready and anxious to return to her work with the cessation of hostilities. Not a week passed without hearing from her, and her letters always sparkled and over- flowed like water bubbling up from a living fountain. Whatever shadows had fallen on her early life, were closely veiled; her cheerful spirit reflected only the glory of God's world and the light of the Sun of Righteousness. 18     274    BBNDImNG WILLOW. One sunny April morning, the familylingered in the breakfast-room to watch some English sparrows which came every day to pick, up the crumbs the children placed upon the win- dow-sill for them. These birds had become quite tame with feeding, and would peer in through the crystal plate-glass upon the bright-hued geraniums, or watch the move- ments of the gold-fishes in their globe of water. Sometimes they would answer the clear notes of the canary, and turn their heads as if listening for more. Faith's chil- dren thought there never were any birds so intelligent as these, not even the Medawe's blue-birds which their mother had so often told them of. And this morning the story had to be repeated, and Weenie's song to old "Mother Wassa" sung; then grandpa was prevailed on to tell his little Paul the legend of the red boy who was changed into a bird. But before the little boy-robin had flown away to the top of the wigwam in Mr. Lindall's story, they heard the door-bell ring, and a   G OING HOME,      275 minute after, Uncle Harry's quick, lively step was on the stairs. "Oh! he'll frighten the birds away," ex- claimed little Weenie, running toward the door, and putting up her tiny finger in token of silence. But Uncle Harry would not be silenced. He only caught her in his arms and perched her on his broad shoulder with a merry laugh, then stooped and pulled one of Paul's ears, and threatened to proceed to the nursery and annihilate the baby, if they did not, one and all, hasten to the parlor and receive the visitors he had just ushered in. "Visitors at this hour!" exclaimed Faith. "Why, Uncle Harry must either be dreami- - or April fooling!" "Pshaw," quoth Harry. "You know very ,well our Western friends never stand for ceremony." "But they usually send either card or name," persisted Faith. "Who was inquired for?" "The Chief of the White Hand, Bright-Eyes,     276   t  BENDING WILLOW. and bothJ their squaws," returned Harry, with another of his merry laughs. "I will venture to take in the pappooses." So saying, he seized upon Paul and retreated with both children in the direction of the parlor. James and Faith followed, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Lindall quite wrapped in mystery. It was not many minutes, however, before Faith returned with tears in her eyes. "It is a messenger from Silver Lake," she said. "The good chief has sent Ossewa to call back his friends. An agent accompanies him, and both are on their way to Washing- ton." "Ossewa, did you say?" returned  Mr. Lindall, bewildered by what he heard. "Os-- sewa was the St. John of my flock." "And he is now up in the parlor," said his wife, taking his hand to conduct him thither. "He brings us a message from White Cloud." Mr. Lindall's feeble steps were more un-   GOING HOME.      2" steady than usual as they led him into the presence of the messengers. He could scarcely comprehend the joyful tidings that the dis- affected young men had returned to their homes, humbled and ashamed, and promised thenceforward to live like white men if their good teachers and trader would come to them again. White Cloud had escaped from all the wiles and machinations of Black Adder, unharmed.  The. latter was dead, and no inciter to mischief or disturber of the peace remained. "Tell me about our poor orphan children, and Weenie," Mrs. Lindall said, in a broken voice. "The teachers' children are well, and doing the work they learned of the Christ-woman; but Bending Willow sleeps the sleep of the silent," Ossewa replied, with much feeling. "All the autumn, White Cloud and his hunters fed her with the choicest game, but it could not satisfy the hunger of her spirit.. She heard the voices of her friends on the     278     BENDING WILLOW. other side, and followed their call with a joyful song. Never will the young men of the Lake forget the good words she spake to them in the name of the Medawe, and their tears dropped fast when they laid her by his side." For a few days all was joy and thanksgiving in the home of the Wests'. Miss Anthony was sent for and preparations were commenced for the return journey, or, as they all said, "for going home." Only Mis. Lindall seemed sad and thoughtful, when her tender eyes followed her husband's weak steps. Faith and Alice both observed it, and spoke of it to one another, but they asked no questions. "If mamma has anything to tell us, we shall hear it in her own time," Faith said. "I am certain she sees something beyond our dim vision, and I think it concerns father. Sometimes I fancy I discover the spectre too, but James says father has never been as well since his arrival here as now." "Certainly, he has never been as cheerful," rejoined her friend; "his face looks as bright   G01G' HROME.      279 as a happy saint's. Only yesterday he said to me, 'iMy cup is running over, Alice! Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life.' His heart has been almost broken until now for his little flock in the wilderness." That same afternoon, James and Harry brought a new carriage to the door for him to look at, a large, roomy vehicle, destined for Silver Lake. It was a present for Mr. and Mrs. Lindall, just the article of comfort they needed and had often wished for. On its softly-cushioned seats they might repose, following the long prairie-paths, when civiliza- tion was left behind. Mr. Lindall examined it closely, and appeared as delighted with it as a child. "Only look! there are places here to stow away everything, Mary," he said. "And it will hold all the children, if they ever come to see us. I never expected such a luxury in this life." The new carriage was filled to overflowing     280    BENDING WILZLOW. that same afternoon. They went to the Park to see the budding trees, and early-blossoming shrubs and plants, and to take a look at the animals, just liberated from their winter cells. Even Mrs. Lindall forgot her secret care and grew joyous with the children as they rolled along the beautiful drive, pausing now and then to admire the massive bridges, or to notice the swan on the lake, or the black gondola as it glided over the water. "This is a beautiful world, and we have had a charming ride," Mr. Lindall said, as they assisted him from the carriage, and -up the massive steps on his return. "But I find pleasure no less fatiguing than labor," "If a ride of ten miles wearies you, my dear sir, how will you endure a journey of more than as many hundreds?"James inquired, with a solicitude, marked for the first time by a tone of doubt. Faith was quick to observe it, but the readiness and cheerfulness of the reply reassured her. "The air of the Northwest is invigorating. i,   GOING HOXM.      281 It will strengthen me as we go. I long to breathe it again, my son." It was a desire never to be gratified, although "hope told a flattering tale " until the last. It lacked only two or three days of the time specified for the return of Ossewa and the commissioners, and the preparations of the missionaries were nearly completed. No one had courage to say, what all were begin- ning to see and feel, that Mr. Lindall was going on a longer journey. The tone of the happy household grew insensibly hushed. The clildren no longer besought dear grandpa for stories, for, whenever they would have done so, he was either resting on the sofa, or asleep in his arm-chair, and their mother told them he must not be disturbed. And one morning when little Paul went to his room, as usual, to clamor for the first kiss, his father met him at the doQr, led him in and held him up to kiss a forehead cold as marble. At first he was much shocked;     282     BENDING WILLOW. then, with a child's simple confidence, ran away to tell his sister that their grandfather was not going to Silver Lake any more, for he had gone away to live with God in Heaven. It was true. The death-messenger had come suddenly and by night; but it found the faithful soldier reposing on his arms and ready. Only one anxiety mingled with the final triumph: "Who will now care for my feeble flock?"And when Miss Alice informed him that the Missionary Board had already detailed a faithful assistant to lighten his labors, he replied, "It is all right then, and you will go back, my dear daughter and friend, charged with my dying love and blessing." There was no more struggle it was music ceased. Ossewa returned in time to follow the remains of the beloved teacher to their final rest in the beautiful Greenwood city, not far from Sylvan Water.

ISS ALICE   and the new teacher returned with Ossewa to the'land of the Ojibwas, leaving Mrs. Lindall to the tender care of her children, for a time, at least, until her aching heart should grow familiar with its loss. White Cloud and his followers at Silver Lake met the teachers with open arms and with every demonstration of joy; but when they looked in vain for the "White Hand," their first and best friend, and saw on Ossewa's brow the long lines of black paint which he wore in token of mourning, they rent their garments and wept, while they filed slowly and silently back to their homes in the village. (284)   CONCLUSION.      285 The grief of none was deeper or more sincere than that of the repentant young men, whose alienation and disaffection had caused the good man's banishment. It was their hands which had lain at the mission door the choicest gifts they could obtain as a peace- offering to welcome his return,-a robe of richest far and reindeer moccasins for himself, and white antelope-skins for the "Christ woman," whose gentle words and ways stole back into their hearts as soon as the fierce thirst for war and excitement was appeased. They are much mistaken who suppose the red men never indulge in the weakness of tears. Though less emotional than the Anglo- Saxon race, their sorrows assert themselves through the same human channels, and their dirges and laments are as mournful as the "Dirige gressus mea@" of the ancient ritual. The live-long night succeeding the return of the broken mission party, White Cloud's entire band were gathered around the long-closed chapel, wailing in their own wild way; and '   ,I           '     286    BENDING WILLOW. when, the next day, Miss Alice and Harry West went thither, and draped the interior with black, solemn visages gazed at them through the open door and peered in at the windows; and tearful men and women assem- bled on the following Sabbath to listen to White Hand's last messages of love-and good- will from the lips of the new missionary. Well might they, weep for the friend and brother, who gave them, in his great love, him- self, withholding nothing. The mission school had suffered less than Miss Anthony feared and expected. The two native girls, Mrs. Lindall's proteges, did their best to sustain it, and succeeded wonderfully considering their many discouragements. Thanks to Harry West's generosity and White Cloud's care, they had suffered for nothing but the sympathy and companionship of their more than parents, of the friends who had guided their erring steps into paths of plea- santness and peace. The last few years have wrought surprising   CONCLUSION.      287 changes in the character of the mission settlement, converting it into a large and thriving village. A rival town has sprung into existence on the northern shore of the lake, and the scream of the locomotive will soon startle its solitudes on the way to the Northern Pacific. The missionary work goes bravely on. The little chapel in the wilderness has grown into a commodious church, and the sound of its bell is echoed by another in the upper vil- lage. White Cloud accepts the changes, though his heart is full of memories of the past. He is still the friend of the settlers and the friend of the new missionaries, although no teachings are like those of Listen-to-the-end and White ,Hand, no ministry as gentle as Mrs. Lindall's, no hymns as sweet as those which floated over the lake when "Bright Eyes" and Faith paddled the Wild Goose and brought home lilies. Miss Anthony and Harry West are his favorites now, the living links between him and friends departed. Mrs. Lindall has never revisited the scene     288     BENDING WILLOW. of her long and weary labors, though her heart and hands are still active in the service. of her beloved mission. Broken in health, but cheerful in faith and hope, she will labor on until she hears the call to her heavenly rest and reward. Every year her box of com- forts finds its way to Silver Lake, and little children, who scarcely remember her living presence among them, whisper her name as that of some good guardian spirit of their race. And thus, linked with the White Hand's, will it long live in Ojibwa history and tradition. James West goes not unfrequently to his trading-posts in the Northwest, and has promised White Cloud to send the great iron horse past the waters of his lake, snorting on his way to the sunset. The chief does not doubt his word, fully believing that "Bright Eyes" deals in magic. But the happiest summer of years to the Ojibwa chief was one when Faith came with her children, to point out to them the play-places of her childhood, and to show them the graves   CONCLUSION.      289 of her early friends, the good Medawe and Bending Willow, beside the Lake of the Great Spirit. - To'little Paul, who greatly resembled his grandfather, he became especially attached, and nothing pleased him more than the boy's assurance tlat, when he was old enough, he would come and live with the chief and his Uncle Harry, and become an Indian mission- ary.  Weenie was like her mother, and both chil- dren were as greedy of stories as she had been in former years. White Cloud loved to gra- tify them, and tales as wonderful as the Medawe's, delighted them continually. He told them the story of "The Red Swan,"' that crimsoned the air, the tree tops and the river with its ruby splendor, and against which neither arrow nor snare could prevail; and there was no end to their questions and speculations about the four magic cettles, that could walk, talk, dance and sing, and make of a single grain of corn and a whortleberry a meal to satisfy a hungry hunter. They often laughed 19     290    BENDING WILLOW. with the chief over the tale of "The Ugly Toad Woman," and wept whenever he told them of Sheem, the poor little forsaken boy who was turned into a wolf, But there was no story which pleased the children more, or which they repeat oftener, than the one I am going to tell my young readers here at the close of the book. THE ORIGIN OF THE BLUE-BIRDS. In the disguise of a peaceable, friendly old Indian, a very wicked Manito * once lived in the most beautiful country of the whole Northwest. There was plenty of game in the region, plenty of fish, and the greatest abul- dance of fruits, for the country was as fertile as it was beautiful; but this wicked spirit did not care for any of them. His sole pleasure was in the destruction of men, whom he beguiled by a thousand arts and stratagems. The country where he dwelt was formerly very thickly peopled, but so many had fallen vic- * An evil spirit.   CONCL USION.     291 tims to his cruelty that the pleasant land became in time almost a solitude. The grand secret of this evil being's success lay in his surprising speed. Whenever he wished to destroy a person, he would chal- lenge him to a foot-race, and if his' antagonist bade fair to outstrip him, he would immedi- ately change himself into some swift-footed animal, and thus leave his rival behind. For this reason, no one was ever known to van- quish him. This same evil genius had very pleasant, winning manners, and used to go around from lodge to lodge with sweet words for old and young. He never boasted of his exploits, or wore any tokens of a conqueror, although he had thinned every family for leagues around. The whole country was afraid of him, for the young men never refused his challenges for fear of being called cowards, and an Indian will die sooner than be called a coward. There was a poor woman living not far from this wicked Manito, whose husband and seven     292    BENDING WILLOW. sons had all perished at his hand. She dwelt now with her only daughter and a little boy half-grown. This woman was so poor and feeble, and often suffered so much for the necessities of life, that she would gladly have died, but for her two remaining children, whom she wished to rear in the knowledge and fear of the Great Spirit, and to be good and useful. Twice had the soft-toned Manito visited her wigwam to discover whether her little son would not soon be old enough to challenge, and the poor mother was in con- stant fear that, notwithstanding all her admonitions and instructions, her youngest would be ensnared like his father and elder brothers. She had great comfort in her daughter, Minda, a kind, obedient girl, who disdained no labor of the lodge, although very skilful in every womanly art and accomplishment. There was not a maiden in the country who could stain the porcupine's quills as brightly as she; no other hands could construct   CONCLUSION.      293 such dainty moccasins and leggins, or weave the wampum into belts as beautiful as hers. The widow's lodge stood upon a hill over- looking a lake. Behind it was a wide stretch of prairie, covered with grass and flowers, and beyond, a forest of grand old trees. Every day Minda went to this forest to bring dry branches for her mother's fire, pausing to admire the beauty and fragrance of the flowers as she went and came. The birds were not afraid of her, for she never harmed them, and often sang with them in strains as sweet as theirs. One morning she strayed further than usual, and came to a bank so thickly spangled with blossoms that she threw herself down among them to rest. It was not long before a bird of singular beauty, with red and blue plumage, alighted near her and began to carol. Minda knew every song-bird of her native woods, but this was unlike them all. It was a stranger bird, whose notes of mourn- ful sweetness so pierced her heart that she     294    BENDING WILLOW. wohdered whether some human soul were not imprisoned, and seeking utterance in that wild melody. For a time she sat wholly rapt in the heavenly music, and gazing into the sad eyes of the bird, which continued to pour out its notes before her on the flowery bank. "Poor bird!" she exclaimed, at last, when the lament grew louder and deeper, "what wouldst thou tell me?" Then the bird shook his shining plumage, and replied, "I have wandered over the world and sung to many maidens, but none have ever heeded me before. Listen to me and love me, for I come to do you good." Then he poured forth another flood of song, so thrilling, it made the flowers tremble, and went murmuring away in sweet waves through the forest. Minda returned to the lodge later than usual that morning, and all day her thoughts dwelt on the strange bird and its mournful song and words. She had not courage to speak to her mother of them, however, but   CONCL USION.      295 went again the next morning and every morn- ing after until the strange bird's music became the only music in the world to her. Her mother suspected at last that her daughter had somehow lost her heart in the forest, for though shes remained longer, she brought home less wood, and was not as active as usual in the discharge of her other duties. In answer to her questions, Minda revealed the whole truth, and told her that her bird- lover wished her to. become his wife; then he would assume the form of a hunter, and watch over their wigwam and provide for all their wants. In view of their lonely and destitute condition her mother gave her consent to the proposition, and Minda, with light steps, hastened with the news to the forest. As soon as he heard it, the happy bird went  soaring through the air in blissful circles, dropping music as he went; and Minda watched him until his form was swallowed up in the far, blue sky. ;v     296    BENDING WILLOW. At twilight he appeared at their lodge-door in the guise, of a hunter, with a blue mantle on his shoulders and a red plume. He sat down beside the daughter, and addressed the widow as mother. Early the next morning he asked for the bow and arrows of the lost husband and sons, and went out to hunt in the forest. As soon as he was out of sight of the wigwam, he took his bird form again, and flew away through the air. At evening, he returned with two deer, and the poor woman's lodge was never again destitute of food. Monedoa, for such was the name of Minda's husband, seldom tasted the meat himself; he preferred the fruit and berries which his wife and her young brother gathered, for his appetite and tastes were not at all like those of other red men. One day his mother-in-law told him that the Manito was coming to the lodge again to see how large her son was grown. He replied that he would be absent, much to her relief and his wife's also, who feared he might accept   CONCLUSION.      297 a challenge. But instead of going away, he assumed his bird-form and flew up into a tall tree that shaded the wigwam, that he might see and hear for himself. The Manito came, and cast sharp glances' at the dried meat as he entered the lodge, for a very unusual sight it was there. "Who supplies you with meat so plenti- fully?" he inquired. " y little son is just learning to hunt," the mother responded, artfully. "But some one else is living with you!" he rejoined, sharply. "Kawin! (No indeed.) Who do you think would take any trouble for me?" "Very well! We shall see who provides the meat when we come again!" Now Monedoa up in the tree overheard all the Manito said. As soon as he was gone, the son-in-law made his appearance with more meat, and said to his terrified wife and mother, "Never fear the rascal! I will be here to mpeet him the nest time." They both urged him to     298     BENDING WILLOW. beware of the cruel spirit, who would be sure to challenge and destroy him. When the Manito, came again, Monedoa gave orders that he should be cordially received, and well entertained; that some of the best meat should be put in the pot and flavored with birch-buds as he liked it himself. Then he dressed himself like a warrior instead of a hunter, painted his face very gayly, and was- ready to receive their guest. The Manito eyed him closely, and said to the widow: "Ah! I was right then, when I told you some one was staying here! I see now who brings the deer to your lodge!" After a good deal of pleasant talk together, the visitor invited Monecdoa to meet him the next morning at the race-ground; remarking carelessly that it was fine manly sport, and that he might chance to meet there other warriors, handsome and brave as himself. fhe young man excused himself on the plea that he was a very poor runner. "But you see how old and trembling I am,"   CONCE LSON.      299 returned the artful Manito, "while you are still in the full vigor of youth. Let us take one round just to amuse the lookers-on." "Very well then.' I will do it to oblige you," replied the youth. The evil visitor was much pleased with this reply, and was about to leave, when he was pressed so earnestly to remain and eat with them, he could not well refuse. The young man partook of the food first to satisfy their guest that it was good and whole- some, and then said, "This feast was pre- pared especially in your honor. Let us eat it all as a mark of gratitude to the' Great Spirit, who permits me to kill game and share it with my friends." So they ate and drank and talked together until the Manito had taken the last drop of broth from the dish, and began to cough violently. This was the effect of the birch- buds which suited the bird-nature of Monedoa, but disagreed with that of his guest. He went away soon after, saying he should     300    BENDING WILLOW. expect his young friend at the race-course at the appointed hour. At daybreak the next morning, Monedoa arose and began to oil his limbs and paint his breast and arms red and blue, like the plumage in which he first appeared to Minda. Over his forehead he then placed a tuft of shining feathers. The whole family ac- companied him to the dreaded ground, which encircled a little lake, called the Lake of Death. The Manito's lodge stood near this lake, and was surrounded by several other lodges which were inhabited by his kindred, who shared his wretched spoils. As soon as the young hunter and his friends made their appearance, the inmates of these lodges cried out, "We have visitors!" Then the Manito came forth, and they all went together to the starting-post, which was an upright pillar of stone, that served also for the goal; for, as I have said before, the race-course encircled the lake.   CONCLUSION.      301 "Before we start," said the Manito, "I wish you to understand you must abide the wager, which is always li/e for life /" "So be it then," replied Monedoa. "We will see whose head gets broken this time." "We shall," rejoined the evil spirit, casting a sly look upon the fresh, handsome young hunter. "I am very old, as you see, but will try to make a decent run, nevertheless." "I am ready," said Monedoa. The signal shout was then given, and both set off at high speed, the Manito first, the young man close behind him. Then the tricky old spirit changed himself into a fox, and went leaping away from his competitor. With a glance upward, Monedoa assumed his bird-shape, and, with a single flight, planted himself before his adversary in his hunter's garb again. When the Manito saw his rival before him, he exclaimed, "Who! who! What does all this mean?" And quick as thought he changed himself           .        .     302    BENDING WILLOW. into a wolf, and trotted past Monedba again. Once more the young man took wing, shoot- ing suddenly into the air, and descending, as before, in advance of his antagonist. As he passed the wolf, he whispered in his ear, "Can you run no faster than this, my friend?" The wicked Manito began to feel a little troublec when, looking forward, he beheld AMoneda walking along qiite leisurely. But he now took the form of a deer, and ran more swiftly than ever, passing the hunter in a few seconds. The race was more than half run, and the bird-form whirred through the air again and alighted beside the Manito, whispering again, "Is this all your speed?" There was only one more change for the bloodthirsty fiend; it was into a bqffalo, and with that animal's long strides he was soon foremost, but, with the great exertion; his tongae lolled from his mouth, and the perspi- ,ration dropped from him in torrents. Mone-. d6a observed this, and springing upward,   CONCLUSRION.     303 planted himself within a few feet of the goal, fresh as at starting. "Ba7ah, Neejee! Stop, stop, my friend!" cried the wretch. "I wish to speak to you." Moned6a laughed aloud, and replied, "I will speak with you at the starting-point. Hurry up, or you will lose the wager! Recol- lect, it was life for life!" The blue-bird had won the 'race. In his mortal shape, the hunter could now stretch but lis hand and touch the goal. Radiant with beauty, his face lit up with triumph, his plume waving in the breeze, Monedoa leaped to the post and was hailed with a great shout by his fiiends. The Manito came up, trembling with fear and disappointment. "Spare my life," he said, in a beseeching tone. t"Let me live, my friend! I have never harmed you." "As you have meted unto others, so shall it be measured to you now," saidl Monedoa, seizing the wicked spirit and dashing his head against the stone pillow. At sight of this, his     304    BENDING WILLOW. friends raised a cry of horror, and fled so fast and far, they have never been heard of since. Very thankful for their deliverance from the evil genius, the widow and her children walked away in silence. Their hearts were too full for words. When they reached the fragrant, flowery bank in the wood where Minda first met her bird-mate, Monedoa turned to his mother-in-law, and said: "The Great Spirit, moved with pity for your misfortunes, sent. me to befriend you. Your son is now old enough to supply your wants. He has no longer anything to fear from the wicked Manito. I have accomplished the work for which I was sent, and will now take home with me the being I love, and whom I have ever found so gentle and good. May the blessing of the Good Spirit remain with you forever." While the widow and her son were marvel- ling at these words, they observed a change coming over Monedoa and  linda, and the next lioment they rose into the air, two beau-   CONCLUSION.      305 tiful birds, clothed in shining feathers of red and blue. Very sweet were their carols as they soared higher and higher, and as their last notes fell into the mother's ears, a sweet peace filled her/ heart, and she returned to her lonely lodge full of gratitude to the Master of Life for all his goodness. The songs of Moned6a and Minda are heard upon the earth sometimes, although their forms are never seen below. It is their children's bright wings that flit about us as soon as winter is over, and whose songs make glad all the forest-paths in summer. It was the children of Monedoa and Minda, the good Medawe loved and fed, and whose favorite home is still at Silver Lake. It is the blue- birds' children that the little ones see every day among the sugar-trees, and follow when they flit away to the Lake to sing above the ashes of Listen-to-the-end, or upon the grave of Bending Willow, for Moned6a and Minda are the parents of all the blue-birds. 20     {l  ur    1   530 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, October, I87x.

' The present work is an attempt to bring out into strong relief before the imagination the great facts of the Bible story. The wish has been, so to set forth the Bible incidents and course of history, with its train of actors, as to see them in the circumstances and coloring, the light and shade, ofitheir actual existence. The work is well done. It shows study and research, and has thrown around it the charms of a vivid imagination, which will make the study inviting to the young. We commend it most cordially." -S. S.

Full of the spirit of a pure domestic life, and with the religious element gently and persuasively wrought in, and not at all in that lumpy state which is so alarming to children, who always skip round such nodules of goodness, these books are just the thing for the family. They are sure to be read, and surely as they are read, good is done."- Lutheran. Agate Stories. By the author of the "Basket of Flowers."       I6mo. $i.25. "The name of the author of the ' Basket of Flowers' must go far to com- mend them; and no one can read them without being charmed with the discovery of the same winning tenderness, the genial simplicity, the graphic power, the attractive exhibitions of purity and truth and piety, that so strongly mark the 'Bas- ket of Flowers,' and have maintained its undying popularity both among parents and children." - Lutherza.     12  CARTERS' BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.
