               OR, THE TRIUMPH OF PRINCIPLE. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                  THREE persons-mother, son, and daughter-sat together round the fire of a comfortably famished room in the respectable street of a great city. It was evening, and the wind howled without, and the rain dashed against the windows, while within the room all was silence. The eldest of the group, the mother, sat with her elbow resting on the table, and her cheek resting on her hand, gazing into the fire steadily and very gravely; the girl was quietly engaged at her books; while the son, a lad of about fourteen, looked anxiously at his mother, and sighed and shifted uneasily on his chair, as he observed her to steal her handkerchief to her eyes, and then take it away again to continue her gaze into the red hot embers of the glowing grate. For a few minutes the boy regarded his mother, as we have said, in silence, but at last, when for the third or fourth time she had held her handkerchief to her eyes for a longer period than before, he left his chair noiselessly, and stealing behind her, he wound his hand round her neck, and laying his smooth young cheek to hers, he said:- 
                  "Keep up your heart, mamma; dear mamma, keep up your heart, or mine will break to look at you." 
                  She kissed him fondly, and leaned her head upon his shoulder-"I wish he were come and gone, Gerald; I wish it were all over," she said, tremulously and faintly. 
                  "And so it will, mamma; do not be so uneasy; remember that he is but a man after all," said the lad. 
                  "I know that, my love," was the reply; "but your dear father did not like him, and I, I fear him, Gerald. He is rich, he is hard, we are in his debt, and--" 
                  A short, sharp knock at the door interrupted her, and caused her to start from her seat, although, by the time that a small, thin, sharp-visaged man entered the room, she had recovered herself, and received his cool and cautious salutations with composure. He took a chair, put on his spectacles, drew a candle nearer to him, produced a black pocket-book, opened it deliberately, took from it a document, and, after examining it carefully, looked at the lady over his spectacles, and spoke:- 
                  "I have examined the books and papers you were good enough to entrust to my care, madam," he said, in a quick, short, irritable voice, "and I regret to say that the issue is unfavourable. Here is a rough draft of Mr. O'Reilly's liabilities, and the assets, possible and available, left to meet them, and you will see that the former exceed the latter by a large figure." 
                  The widow took the paper and glanced at it:- 
                  "Twelve hundred pounds," she said, in a low, agitated tone." It is indeed a large sum, Mr. Hastings-too large, although, had my dear husband's life been spared, he would have paid it to the last penny, for he was an honest man." 
                  "Spread his wings too wide, madam; dabbled in matters, shares, and such like, which he knew nothing about," replied the old gentleman, chuffly. "I often told him so, and warned him of the consequences, when he came to me for a renewal of bills, and further accommodation, and soforth. He thought me a very hard-hearted old fellow, I dare say, but you see I was right, after all. No man should venture beyond his depth; I never do-never did. Had I done so, I should not be able to bear the loss of the six hundred and odd pounds due to me, which I suppose I must. No, no-no speculation for me; no gambling, no risking other people's money, and losing my own. I began life on little-very little, and I increased it by always cutting my cloth according to my measure. I worked hard, and lived hard; if I had not the price of my dinner, a crust and a cup of water served me for supper, and I never put even a shirt to my back until I had the money in my hand to pay for it. That was always my way, madam, and it throve with me. Fair and easy goes far in the day, and short reckonings make long friends." 
                   
                  "Twelve hundred pounds!" again said Mrs. O'Reilly, looking at the formidable rows of figures presented to her. 
                  "A large sum, madam-a very large sum for honest men to lose," persisted the creditor; "but it can't be helped, I suppose; doubtless, as you say, had your husband lived, he would have worked through; but he didn't-died suddenly, and left us in the lurch; there it is; overshot the mark, lost his credit, and ended by losing his life into the bargain. Altogether a bad business-very bad. Not that you have so much to complain of as others; you are secured for your settlement, and a thousand pounds will give you time to look about you a little. There are some few of the poorer class of creditors-struggling people, to whom the loss of a few pounds is a great one-whom, I suppose, you will settle with; not that it is obligatory on you, however; the thousand pounds are yours by right, and you can do as you please with it." 
                  "My son and I have been talking that matter over, sir," replied Mrs. O'Reilly, more firmly, "and his opinion is, that I have no right to leave his father's debts unpaid, if I can, by any means, or at any sacrifice, manage to discharge them." 
                  "Your son, madam! What son? Eh! Where is he?" suddenly demanded the old man. "I never knew you had a son old enough to advise with." 
                  "Gerald is young, sir," answered Mrs. O'Reilly, "but he and I have no secrets from each other, and since his father's death we have spoken much together of his affairs. Here he is." 
                   
                  Gerald came forward, and Hastings looked at him steadily from head to foot. 
                  "What age are you, young gentleman?" he demanded, in his short, sharp tone. 
                  "Rather more than fourteen, sir." 
                  "A young adviser, madam," said the old man, "but I dare say an honest one. What did you say his name was?" 
                  "Gerald." 
                  "Well, and so, Gerald, you advised your mother to give up her claims upon the estate to pay your father's debts? It that the fact?" 
                  The boy blushed, but he answered quietly:- 
                  "Yes, sir, that was my advice to mamma." 
                  "Umph! And do you know, child, what the effect of her following this advice would be?" 
                  "I think I do, sir," said Gerald, modestly. 
                  "Hardly, I should think," went on Hastings, still keeping his eye on him. "Why, boy, your advice would make her a beggar." 
                  "It would make her poorer-much poorer than she is, sir," replied Gerald, "but not a beggar, I hope." 
                  "Indeed! why, she has no other property, has she?" 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Then how is she to get on? what is she to do?" 
                  "God will assist her, sir, I hope," replied the boy, manfully and gravely, "and I will do my best to help and earn for her. Papa's creditors ought to be paid; papa's good name must be taken care of now that he is dead, as he would have taken care of it himself if he had lived long enough; papa-dear papa, loved us both"-the poor boy's eyes filled, and his voice faltered, but he went on, "and the best way we can prove our gratitude for his love is to follow his example, and endeavour to be as upright and honest as we know he would wish us to be." 
                  "But poverty, child-utter poverty is a terrible thing to encounter," said Hastings. "You don't know how terrible it is." 
                  "No sir, I do not-as yet," said Gerald, with a sigh; "but God commands us to do unto others as we would that others should do unto us, and we have no right to receive money which is due to others, in order that we may escape the poverty which the loss of it may bring them to, if we accept it. Besides, if you please, sir, I am young, I am strong, I can work, and-and as mamma thinks as I do, we would rather take our chance in the world together than leave papa's debts unpaid. We may be poor, but we shall be neither ashamed nor unhappy when we have done what we ought to do." 
                  "And you join your son in all this, madam?" said the old gentleman, turning to Mrs. O'Reilly. "You ought to think seriously about it; I tell you so, although I shall be a gainer by your giving up the large sum which was settled on you at your marriage, as an equivalent for what you brought to your husband." 
                  "I have thought seriously about it, sir," was Mrs. O'Reilly's reply, "but I-I think that Gerald is right, and I should wish my claim to be deducted from the general account and divided amongst Mr. O'Reilly's creditors. I have friends and relatives to whom I can apply, and I dare say, in one way or other, that we shall do very well. I am obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and although there will still be a deficiency in the funds, you will have to divide, still, with God's assistance, even that may be provided for hereafter. Shall I offer you a cup of tea?" 
                  "By all means, madam," said the old man, in a much more cheerful tone; and while it is getting ready, I will take the liberty of catechizing your son a little. 
                  He called Gerald to sit beside him, and while Mrs. O'Reilly made the tea, he questioned the lad as to his proficiency in learning, his general tastes and leanings, and his particular wishes regarding a pursuit in life. To all the questions asked him, Gerald answered readily. He had no reserves to make, no secrets to keep. He had been reared by his parents to tell the truth, and to say what he had to say candidly and freely; he had been much confided in, and now, at this crisis of her life, his suffering mother was beginning to feel the judiciousness of the course she had pursued, and to find how great is the consolation of having a fond and faithful heart to lean upon when the day of trouble comes. On the boy's part, his mind, without being precociously ripe, was more advanced than those of his years usually are, because his training was better and his experience larger; he had always been made the friend and familiar of his father and mother, and from their discussions and the conversation of their friends he had gained a knowledge of the world, which now promised to befriend him, suddenly bereaved as he was, and placed in circumstances with which it was difficult to deal. Yet he had dealt with them in an upright and uncompromising spirit; he had discussed their altered and perilous circumstances over and over a hundred times with his mother since his father's death; and he well knew all the difficulties which he must prepare to meet. But this did not stop-did not daunt him; his father's memory must be respected; his father's creditors ought to be paid their due, and he had implicit reliance on the goodness of providence, whose smile was never wanting to those who deserved to prosper. And so when his mother consulted him, he eased her apprehensions and raised her hopes, and this it was which made him not unwilling to face his father's largest creditor, and which enabled him now to answer his questions without confusion or reserve. 
                  When Mr. Hastings had concluded his conversation with Gerald, he found that he was an intelligent, open-hearted, sensible fellow, who had attended diligently to his books, and had therefore, for his years, accumulated a very respectable stock of information indeed. He wrote a good hand-for the old gentleman demanded to see a specimen-understood accounts counts well; was a good grammarian, a tolerable linguist, and had perused the best historical and geographical works, so as to retain their principal and most useful points; he had been trained to piety and virtue at the seminary of a Reverend Father, whose saintly inculcations were well fitted to make his pupils an ornament to society, and a credit to their friends; and, altogether, he was what might be fairly called a well-informed boy, whose educational training fitted him for mercantile rather than professional life. Indeed, his father, who was himself a general merchant, always intended his son to follow his own pursuits, and although Mr. O'Reilly had suffered his love of speculative venture to involve him in difficulties, still as a father, husband, and friend he was above reproach, and had studiously trained his son, both by precept and example, to become an amiable, honourable, and accomplished man. 
                  The tea was made and drank, and when Mr. Hastings took up his hat to depart, Mrs. O'Reilly wondered to herself how it was that she had feared meeting him so much:- 
                  "I will call Mr. O'Reilly's creditors together tomorrow, madam," he said, on taking leave, "and will submit to them the proposition you have entrusted me to make. I quite agree with you that your husband's debts ought to be paid, so far as it can be done; his memory demands that justice at your hands; and for the rest, I trust that you and my young friend Gerald here will find that honesty is ever the best policy in the long run. The pride of principle is unlike every other sort of pride; it is neither envious, malicious, nor uncharitable; it can bear to see its neighbour prosperous as well as itself; it preserves its possessor from stooping to the rich or grinding the poor; it thanks God for what he gives, and is content with it; and it teaches us so to guide our steps and select our friends, as that hereafter we may have no reason to retrace the one or to look coldly on the other. Proper pride is the proper name given to this great virtue, madam, and in all essentials it differs as much from the pride of riches as the glorious blaze of the mid-day sun, fructifying, enlightening, and invigorating all it looks upon, differs from the feeble light of a farthing rush-light. I thank you for your cup of tea, and you shall hear from me to-morrow." 
                  And away he went. 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  PUNCTUAL to his promise, the old gentleman called on the following day about three o'clock:- 
                  "I have arranged it all for you, madam," he said, as he took his seat, put on his spectacles, and produced his pocket-book. "In consideration for your just and liberal dealing, Mr. O'Reilly's creditors have come to the determination to leave you your house and furniture, and to give you also one hundred pounds to begin with. Pardon me; don't refuse it; it is your right, and they have acted wisely and prudently; honest men have a right to encourage honesty in others as well as themselves; many a weak mind is driven to desperation by hard dealing, which under a milder and more considerate treatment might retrieve both credit and character. No, no, don't refuse it; there is no degradation in retaining what is freely voted you by those most concerned. So that point is settled, and now for Gerald. Of course, Gerald, you would like to begin to earn something as soon as possible, I suppose?" 
                  "This very moment, sir, if I could," said Gerald, brightening up. 
                  "Well, just now I happen to want a junior clerk in the office, and you may have the situation if you like. I cannot afford a large salary, however, to young beginners. One pound a week, paid duly and truly on Saturday evening, is my terms; but twenty shillings can do a great deal, if it is well husbanded; I lived for years and years on that sum, and could always manage to give a shilling in charity as well as to support myself and save a little for a rainy day. Besides, by-and-bye, it will increase, as you become more useful, so you may consider yourself pretty well off. My hours are from nine to five; now and then you may be detained later, but then for extra work there is extra pay, so now let me hear what you say to my proposal." 
                  Gerald closed with him at once, and Mrs. O'Reilly, with tears in her eyes, thanked the eccentric old man for his benevolent kindness. 
                  "No thanks to me, madam," he said; "it is every man's duty to assist those who are willing to assist themselves, and it is a matter of prudence in a trader like myself to look out for honourable assistants, and to bind them to us if we can. Your son has been well taught-well trained; he has given proof of it by his advice to you, and by his respect for his dead father's good name. Let him persevere as he has begun, and he will yet be a prosperous man. I shall expect him at nine to-morrow morning. In a week I will have all your matters arranged, and then you shall see me again. Farewell." 
                  He departed, blessing and blessed, as the charitable always do, leaving the perfume of peace behind him, and bearing it in his own heart as well. And yet the world called him a hard man, and doubtless he was so towards those who did not come up to his standard of principle, which was a high one. Punctual himself, he required punctuality in others; frugal and industrious, extravagance in outlay or waste of time was particularly abhorrent to him; and he had no sympathy with those who by imprudence or intemperance brought upon themselves evils which an opposite course of conduct would have enabled them to avoid. He attended the sacraments regularly, gave liberally to the poor, and to the church, the poor's best friend, and never laid his head on his pillow without invoking the mediation of the Queen of Heaven, the Mother of all purity, with her divine Son, that he might always be preserved in a state of grace, and be enabled to fulfil his duties as a good Catholic and an upright man. 
                  Meanwhile Mrs. O'Reilly and Gerald prepared for the new state of things, and during the evening all their arrangements were made. Strict economy was to be the order of the day with them all. Part of their house was to be let in lodgings; little Fanny's music mistress was to be retained for the present; but in the evenings, between Gerald and his mother, they thought themselves quite competent to superintend her general education, and therefore the day school to which Fanny was accustomed to go was given up. Gerald felt that a serious charge had devolved on him, and when he went to his bed-room, he first pondered for half an hour on what he had to do, and then prayed devoutly to God and to his saints that strength might be given him, both of mind and body, to fulfil his good intentions and act well his part. 
                  Mr. Hastings was a general merchant in very extensive trade, arid when Gerald appeared at his place of business, his employer at once introduced him to his head clerk, a Mr. Dillon, and placed him under his charge. Dillon was a staid, elderly, methodical man, somewhat timid and suspicious, and peculiarly susceptible of first impressions; and as he had been prepossessed by his employer's representations of "the new hand," he willingly took him under his charge, and gave him some good advice, when Mr. Hastings went out and left them together. 
                  "You must begin with the rough work, Gerald," he said, "at the bottom rung of the ladder; but don't quarrel with it, you will get up the other steps in time if you deserve it. You will find two or three lads here, a little wilder than they ought to be, and who have yielded to Mr. Joseph's example and advice. Mr. Joseph is Mr. Hastings' nephew, you see, and may be his successor here, one day or other, if he pleases; but he is a wild slip, Gerald, very wild and very pleasant withal; but still, as you have your way to make, my lad, I advise you to be civil to him, but to avoid his intimacy. Stay-there is another youth, Richard Bassett, who is a great friend and crony of Mr. Joseph's; don't do as he does, I advise you, for he applauds everything his richer friend does, and accompanies him everywhere, after hours, a course which, as a well-wisher, I counsel you to avoid. Come now, and I will introduce you to your new companions, and show you what to do." 
                  In the different departments of the warehouse, several assistants, young and old, were scattered, to whom Gerald was formally introduced, and amongst them to Mr. Joseph Hastings and Mr. Richard Bassett, who were working together. With these Mr. Dillon left Gerald to assist in preparing an extensive order, and returned to his official desk, after pointing out what was to be done. They were both a year or two older than Gerald, and although they were obliged to work, in order to be up to time in the execution of the order, still it was evident that they laboured unwillingly, and while they did so, they spoke slightingly and disrespectfully of their employer, and hazarded several jests at his expense. Gerald could not laugh at or join in this, as they seemed to expect that he would do; but he said nothing for the present, but did the work allotted to him, and listened in silence to all that they said. As he was raw and inexperienced, he found that after a few days these "chums," as they called themselves, were greatly more disposed' to play than to work, and that while they lolled about at their ease, and talked of the "fun" they had enjoyed or were to enjoy, they sought to place their own burthens on his shoulders, or, in other words, to make him do their tasks as well as his own. Of the two, however, he found Dick Bassett infinitely the more exacting. Joseph Hastings was an easy-tempered, indolent, careless lad, fond of pleasure, and not scrupulous as to the kind; he was easily led, and as his uncle was fond of Him, and his allowance was liberal, he had more means at his command than he well knew what to do with. But Bassett, who was poor and viciously inclined, took advantage of the weak nature of his friend, and led him to taverns and other scenes of dissipation which injured his health, wasted his money, and depraved his mind. All this, of course, was unknown to Mr. Hastings, whom they called "the governor," and before whom Bassett always appeared to be busy, sober, and industrious, although the moment his back was turned, he laughed at his own success in cajoling his employer, and enjoyed the artifice amazingly. 
                  At first these young men were kind enough to Gerald; they taught him how business was to be done, because it materially assisted and relieved themselves, and they would have induced him to join their parties and spend his money if he had listened to their representations and allurements, and yielded to them. But, fortunately for himself, he had a happy home to return to when his day's work was over, and ample employment when he got there, which was more to his taste than the temptation they offered him. He had Fanny to teach, and the improvement which his docile and pretty pupil made a great deal more than repaid him for the trouble he took to instruct her; while, on his own part, he set himself seriously to grapple with French and German, as the languages most likely to be useful to him as a commercial man, and to perfect himself in the art of an accountant, which he felt to be quite as necessary. And then, when these duties were over, he listened to Fanny as she practised her lesson on the piano, or joined her in a song, or read aloud some historical or interesting work to her and his mamma, and afterwards discussed with them the merits of the book they had just read, and concluded the evening by joining his mother and family in reciting aloud the Rosary of the ever Blessed Virgin Mary, in a charming little oratory which, at his leisure hours, and at his own sole expense, he had constructed for his sister. Haying placed themselves under the protection of the Immaculate Mother of all righteousness, and entreated her intercession, and that of all the angels and saints, as the chosen servants of God, from whose prayer for suffering sinners His merciful ear is never turned away, they retired to rest, fortified by their pious exercise, and prepared for that happy, peaceful slumber, which none but the virtuous ever enjoy. 
                  Thus it happened, that the temptations thrown in his way were no temptations to him, determined as he was on the fulfilment of his duties, and fortified by a wish to improve both his sister and himself. He resisted them, therefore, firmly but quietly, and, after a while, he also began to refuse to undertake the additional labour which his fellow-clerks pressed upon him. For this he was at first reviled by Bassett, and finally threatened with personal chastisement; but at this his spirit at once rebelled:- 
                   
                  "I have listened to your ill-language," he said, coolly to his threatener, "because your reproaches are unjust and untrue, and only degrade yourself without injuring me, but a blow is altogether another thing, and I would seriously advise you to think twice before you proceed to inflict it on me." 
                  "Why what can you do?" proceeded Bassett, with a sneer. "If you wish to avoid it do what I require you at once." 
                  "No," said Gerald, quietly; "if you are sick or tired, and ask me to assist you civilly, I will always do my best to oblige you, but from this hour out you must perform your own work with your own hands, or leave it undone, so long as you have strength to do it." 
                  "You will not?" said Bassett, with an ominous frown. 
                  "No; I will not. I have work of my own to do, and that shall be done," was the reply. 
                  "There, then, take that-and that, to stimulate you," said Bassett, giving him a blow and a kick almost at the same time; "and now, my fine fellow, if you would avoid a worse treatment--" 
                  But he could get no further, for in another moment, by a well aimed blow, coolly delivered, the bully lay sprawling amongst some empty packages which it was part of his duty to fill. 
                  Before he could rise and renew the contest, his better-natured friend Joseph interfered:- 
                   
                  "He has served you right, Dick," he said; "you had no right to strike him for not doing our business as well as his own, and now he will be telling the Governor and Dillon, and we shall be in a mess." 
                  "Pardon me, Mr. Joseph," said Gerald, gallantly, "I shall do no such thing; I am perfectly well able to defend myself, without appealing to anybody. Tour uncle or Mr. Dillon shall hear no complaint from me of what has passed. I warn you both, however, that as I am determined to do my own duty henceforth, and not to do yours, so I am resolved to tell the truth should it be neglected. Mr. Hastings has been a kind friend to me, and I am grateful to him for it; I will not see his interests uncared for, or his business undone. I know not what may be his claims upon either of you, but common honesty, if not a better motive, should oblige you to earn your wages, and not to defraud your employer of your time. Do what is right and what you are paid for doing, and then it will little matter what stories any one can tell of you." 
                  "I-I believe you are right, Gerald," said Joseph, thoughtfully. "I am beginning to tire of taverns and late hours, and, as you say, the Governor is a good fellow, who wishes to act justly towards every one, and is entitled to the gratitude and good will of those whom he employs. Come, Dick, take what you have got-it was only blow for blow-and let it be a warning to you not to be quite so ready with your hand hereafter. You have lost us a good half-hour by your squabbling, and now if Dillon or the Governor comes this way, we shall hear of it." 
                  Bassett resumed his occupation sullenly and silently, while Gerald and Joseph continued theirs in a better spirit, occasionally addressing each other, and sometimes good-naturedly assisting each other, for Gerald's late exhibition of coolness and courage had wonderfully raised him in the estimation of young Hastings. 
                  "And how do you manage to spend your evenings, Gerald?" asked Joseph, as they paused in their labour. 
                  "Very pleasantly, indeed," answered Gerald, with a smile. 
                  "But you don't always remain at home, do you? that would be terrible slow work," said Joseph. 
                  "I do not find it so, I assure you," replied Gerald; "I have a sister to teach, a mother to please, and myself to instruct, and so between all, when bed hour comes, we are all very often surprised to hear it is so late, I assure you. Besides, sometimes a friend or two comes in to tea, and sometimes we go to them, and altogether I do not feel that I require any better friends or greater amusements than I find in my own quiet home." 
                  "Ah! well, I wish I could say as much," said Joseph, with a sigh; "I have a father and mother, too, but my father always goes out after dinner, and my mother is too busy to sit quiet; and I have brothers thers and sisters, too, but Emma and Mary are always thinking of balls and parties, and Edward and Jem are eternally battling, and all the younger ones are just let to do as they like, so that to me any place is better than home, for there is neither order nor regularity in it, and even Dick Bassett and the tavern are a relief, although, to tell you the truth, Gerald,"-this he said in a whisper,-"I find Dick an expensive friend, who generally leaves me to pay wherever we go, because he knows that the Governor stands to me, although he, poor man, thinks that I spend the extra pay in improving myself. Indeed, one way or other, I must pull up, Gerald, for as it is, I have outrun the constable-got myself into debt, I mean-and unless I take better care for the future, the Governor may come to hear of it, and that would be ruin, for debt is the very thing on earth he most abhors. I should lose his favour and countenance for ever if he were to know how I am involved. But now let us get on; when we are done, I will have another chat with you, for Bassett always laughs at me when I talk of reforming either him or myself, and I hate to be laughed at." 
                  Bassett had been called away during the latter part of their conversation, which gave Gerald an opportunity of saying:- 
                  "No true friend would wish you to run into debt, or hazard your uncle's displeasure, and no prudent adviser would counsel you to persist in a course of pleasure which is attended with such serious risk." 
                   
                  "Yet what can I do?" asked the weak-minded Joseph; "Dick is a capital fellow, after all-up to everything, and knows everybody; I could never get on without Dick. To-night, for instance, we are to meet a party of gay fellows, and if I refused to go, what in the world would I do with myself? I know I shall have to pay more than I can spare--" 
                  "Then don't do it-don't go at all," interrupted Gerald, earnestly; "spend your evening with me if you wish, and try how you will like it, but for goodness' sake, do not suffer any one so far to mislead your easy disposition, as to tempt you again and again into scenes and places which your best friend would wish you to avoid." 
                  "Yes, but my word is pledged, Gerald; Dick and all of them would be disappointed." 
                  "Let them; such a promise is only conditional; to break it injures nobody, and they can amuse themselves very well without you," said Gerald. 
                  "That is true enough, too," answered Joseph; "so, I-I'll speak to Dick about it." 
                  "No, do not do that," said Gerald, laughing; "make your resolution first, and when you speak to him, tell him not that you wish to do it, but that it is done. Remember that you have a great deal at stake, and think seriously that your uncle's good will is not a matter to be lightly lost, nor ought you to risk it because a few foolish young men expect you to be as foolish as themselves. Here is Bassett now; tell him you mean to take your tea with me, and let him come with you if he pleases. My mother will be glad to receive any friends of mine." 
                  Dick Bassett looked dismally black upon hearing of Joseph's new engagement. As to himself, he gave Gerald's courteous invitation a point-blank and very rude refusal, and then set himself to combat Joseph s resolution in every possible form. But, seconded by Gerald, Joseph stood firm, and, at last, the contest ended by Bassett's asking him for a loan of money, and by Joseph's telling him that he had it not to give. 
                  "Had I gone with you to-night, Dick," he said, "I must have borrowed from some one, and thus added to debts which, as it is, it will puzzle me to pay. I have been thinking of retrenchment for some time, and now I am determined on it. Better late than never, you know, and I would seriously advise you to follow my example." 
                  "Aye, and become a milksop and a miser," said Bassett, sneeringly. "No, no, Joe, I hope I have more of the spirit of a man in me than that comes to. I'll make your compliments to our friends, however, and tell them that you are afraid of spending your shillings, and can't come." 
                  "Tell them what you please, sir," replied Joseph, haughtily, displeased at the bantering tone of his friend. 
                  When Gerald returned home, he told his mother what he had done, and the motives which had actuated him. 
                  "I like Joseph Hastings," he said to her, "for he has a good disposition and an amiable heart. But he is weak, and indolent, and easily led, and for his good uncle's sake, as well as his own, I should like to turn him from his present idle and expensive courses into better ones, if I can. He seems disposed to like me, and we must try and amuse him, if possible, mamma; so I will prepare my dissolving views, and my magic lantern, and my galvanic trough, and Fanny shall sing her best songs, and you will be sure to give us a hot cake, and a capital cup of tea, and then, who knows, amongst us, but we may be able, in some degree, to repay Mr. Hastings' goodness to us by serving his favourite nephew in the best way." 
                  Mrs. O'Reilly kissed her son, and promised to second his good intentions to the best of her ability, and so did Fanny, who was now about thirteen years old, and was fast springing up into a very pretty, as well as a very accomplished, girl. 
                  When Joseph arrived in the evening, he was ushered into a neatly furnished, well-lighted parlour, with a bright fire in the grate, bright faces to Welcome him, and everything looking bright and cheerful about him. As the evening passed on, he found the time hang by no means heavy on his hands, and when he parted from Gerald in the hall, he thanked him gratefully for his entertainment, and readily promised to come again as often as they invited him. 
                   
                  "We are seldom from home, and you will always find us the same," was Gerald's answer; "come to us as often as you will, and the oftener the better, if you find it pleasant, or if you think we can be of any use to you." 
                  From that day forth, Joseph Hastings was an altered youth. He and Gerald became "chums," instead of Dick Bassett, for Dick stuck to his old companions and his old habits, although both Joseph and Gerald reasoned with and tried to change him; but he refused to be "schooled," as he called it, and sneered at the good advice given him, even while he witnessed the effect of it in another. Still he scrupled not to borrow money from Joseph, although, when quarter day came round, and he was asked to pay it, he had always an excuse to offer, and was mightily offended when, at last, Joseph insisted on it, in order that his own debts might be paid. 
                  "Mrs. O'Reilly," he said, "has been kind enough to lend me what was necessary to pay my creditors, in order that my uncle might not hear of my folly in running into debt, but she expects to be repaid the loan with which she has accommodated me, and that cannot be done if I lend my money to you, or if you do not honourably pay me what you owe me. Believe me, Dick, it would be better for you to do as I have done, and stop short in time, for you will find, in the long run, that dissipation is not pleasure, and that evil ways, and loose companions, are the surest forerunners of suffering, poverty, and disgrace." 
                   
                  Dick, however, was too hardened to listen to him. He still met his remonstrances with a sneer-called him a milksop and a miser, and paid him back only a part of his debt, and that after many applications, although he had always money to spend on idleness and folly. It was fortunate, perhaps, for Joseph that he had Gerald always near him to keep him up to his good intentions, and to neutralize the attempts which Dick, and Dick's comrades, made to wean him from them, since otherwise, such was his yielding nature, that he might have relapsed and fallen back into errors still greater than before. But as months, and even years, rolled by, Joseph found that Gerald's plans and Gerald's maxims were the best, after all. As Gerald advanced in years, and as his intelligence advanced with them, his sagacious employer, who had watched his conduct keenly, without appearing to do so, had gradually advanced him from the lower departments of his office to the higher, and had advanced his salary also, until, when he was only eighteen years of age, he was in the receipt of a hundred pounds a-year, and enjoyed the unlimited confidence of his employer. 
                  But this was not all. Gerald was not one of those who, having reached a certain height, felt his ambition gratified, and aspired to reach no further; he was aware that, although he might become a successful trader, without possessing much book learning, still the accumulation of riches was not the great aim of his existence, and he, therefore, desired to store his mind with such various and general information as would fit him to take his place in society, and enable him to perform his part there with credit and success. He had always a reasonable quantity of time on his hands, and, although he made it a point of employing his Sundays, in good works, such as teaching the catechism, assisting at charity sermons, organizing collections for the propagation of the faith, and such like pious duties, still, on the evening of other days, he had ample leisure to pursue such a course of study as would hereafter be useful to him in the way he desired it should be. In his intercourse with books, however, as well as in his intercourse with men, he sedulously avoided all acquaintance with what was vulgar, irreligious, anti-Catholic, or otherwise objectionable. He pitied the wretched writers of those so-called "liberal publications," who cater at once for impurity and irreligion, and who conceive that an attack on "Popery" has a right to excuse them in whatever other deviations from decency, truth, and morality they may think proper to indulge; and his taste was too refined, his principles too sound, either to be caught by their cheapness or tempted by their contents. The open attacks on religion, which so many of them glory in making, were scarcely more distasteful to him than those insidiously treacherous ones which so many of these traders in Christianity now make against that Holy Church which was established by Christ himself, and maintained by the labours, services, and sufferings ferings of His saints and martyrs; and, guided at first by his excellent mother and his spiritual director, and afterwards confirmed by his own reason and sense of right, he early looked on them all with an abhorrent eye, and always sought at purer and clearer fountains to drink of those living waters which elevate the imagination, and inform the mind, at the same time, without debasing the principles or jeopardizing the soul. He studied with zeal, and the deepest interest, the history of his own dear country, and every page of it impressed him with still more respect, and still greater pride. While other nations, actuated by sordid or selfish motives, had fallen away from the True Faith, IT had clung to it amidst persecution and temptation-amidst famine and danger, and ridicule and reproach, and was now as steadfast and firm as if the whirlwind of men's evil passions and purposes had not been for centuries at work to uproot the Divine structure, and frighten or seduce its worshippers from their allegiance to the Truth. He also made himself conversant with many branches of science, and with many of the arts which adorn and chasten life. Young himself, he delighted in the society of those of his own years, and, as "birds of a feather flock together," he was, by degrees, enabled to draw around him many who, like himself, preferred rational pleasure to needless and aimless riot, and who, in the indulgence of their own tastes, were careful, at the same time, to avoid committing sin themselves, or of being the cause of it in others. In fact, such is the influence of one pure, strong mind, which sets itself to work in the right way, that, in his own circle, Gerald, without wishing it, became a very leading person, indeed. The fathers and mothers of families were always happy to welcome him as a favoured guest, for whilst his cheerful and happy temperament gave a fresh impetus to rational amusement wherever he went, his well-known purity and regularity of life were a guarantee that all those who mixed with him, or followed his lead, were perfectly safe in doing so. Amongst the junior members of the little community Gerald O'Reilly's opinion and Gerald O'Reilly's decision were paramount; his information, if not very deep, was both various and well-digested, and he communicated it readily, fluently, and with an evident wish to oblige, which added to the interest with which it was received. He sang well, he danced gracefully, he understood the principles of drawing and music, and was no mean proficient in both; but these accomplishments were never obtruded, and although he was too frank, free, and fearless to disclaim them, still they were only brought forward as accessories, and only when, by being so, they promised to communicate pleasure and oblige his friends. It is due, also, to his reclaimed "chum," Joseph Hastings, to say, that the kindly influence which Gerald had established over him had never been lost. Many a temptation had been thrown in his way by Dick Bassett and others, in order to lead him again into their toils, and induce him to forsake the tea-table and its innocent pleasures for the riot of the tavern and the horrors of the debauch; but he was as firm as a rock; he listened to them gravely, and answered them seriously, but he followed his own course steadily, and well it was for him that he had the good sense and resolution to do so, as the sequel will show. 
                  It was about this time that, on a particular morning, Mr. Hastings assembled Joseph, Gerald, and Dick Bassett, in his own sanctum, where few ever intruded except they were sent for, and then only when particular business was to be done. As soon as they were inside, the old gentleman shut the door with his own hand, and then addressed them with much solemnity of manner:- 
                  "I have sent for you here, young gentlemen," he said, "in order to perform a disagreeable office towards one amongst you. To you, Gerald O'Reilly, I have nothing to say, save what is to your credit, and what your best friends would wish to hear. You have performed your duty well and diligently from the first, and the credit and character you have gained for yourself from all who have dealt with you cannot fail to be of use to you in your after life. With you, Joseph Hastings," he continued, addressing his nephew, "I have also reason to be satisfied. At one period of your life, you thought yourself a very clever fellow, and that it was as easy to hoodwink 'the Governor' as you believed it to be. But in that you were mistaken taken; I am better served-better informed, than you think; it is my duty to watch over the proceedings of those in my establishment, in order that I may know how to act. You were in debt, and, therefore, in danger; you were on the high road to ruin, sir, until a wiser, though a younger friend, stepped in to save you; his interference prevented mine, and has converted you from a man of so-called pleasure into a much better and more estimable thing. As for you, Mr. Richard Bassett," he went on, fixing his hard, stern eye on the abashed Dick, "your movements are intimately known to me, and have been so for some time. I grieve to say, sir, that they are such as I highly disapprove of. You have been warned, over and over again, by Mr. Dillon and others at my desire; you have seen, sir, that my nephew has thriven from the moment he withdrew himself from your counsels, and the companions and haunts to which you introduced him; you have been told, that your pursuits would displease me, and yet you persisted in them; and now, sir, as you have chosen your own course, you cannot be displeased if I should take mine. You are no longer an assistant of mine; Mr. Dillon will balance your account, and my parting advice to you is to change your mode of life, and when next you meet a 'Governor' as well disposed as I am, neither to ridicule him behind his back, nor to cheat him before his face, and so a good morning to you." 
                  From Mr. Hastings' decision there was no appeal; so Dick turned away to seek another situation with a tarnished fame, while Joseph and Gerald remained to prosper and become more united every day. In point of fact, after a few years more Mr. Hastings retired from trade with a competent fortune, and his business is now carried on by the firm of "HASTINGS AND O'REILLY," while Fanny O'Reilly has changed her name since last summer, and is now Mrs. Joseph Hastings, and is happy as the day is long. Gerald and his mother still keep house together; and although he is much looked up to in female society, still his home is so happy that he is content with it, and so that he can please his mother, and keep her comfortable, he is perfectly satisfied.

                  CHAPTER I. 
                  "AND do you mean to tell me, Mrs. Manning, that this beautiful lace has been worked by this little girl-this child?" asked Mrs. Butler Adair, as she stood in the milliner's shop, with a roll of lace in her hand, and her eyes fixed on the person indicated, who might be about eleven years of age, or, perhaps, a little more. 
                  Mrs. Manning nodded and smiled. "Oh, madam," she replied, "Eva is quite one of our old hands, now; we could not get on without Eva at all." 
                  "And this work is hers, you say?" 
                  "I should say so by the look. Her mother does a little that way when she has time, and so does little Mary-Eva's younger sister, I mean-but there's none of them have the style, the finish, I may call it, of Eva. It is a beautiful article, positively, ma'am, and would really become you amazingly." 
                  "And who taught you this beautiful art, little girl?" asked the lady of Eva, who stood modestly waiting at the counter of the shop, to get paid for her work. 
                   
                  "Sister Agnes, if you please, ma'am," said the little girl, with a curtsey and a blush. 
                  "Sister Agnes! A nun, I presume?" said the lady. 
                  "Yes, madam," answered Mrs. Manning; "one of the ladies of Loretto; they say she travelled into Belgium-yes, Belgium, I think it was-solely to learn how this sort of work was to be done, in order that she might introduce it here, and give the poor a better means of earning a comfortable livelihood." 
                  "Admirable, indeed; practical benevolence that, Mrs. Manning," said the lady, still looking at the lace. "Well, and how does she succeed?" 
                  "As you see, ma'am," was Mrs. Manning's reply. "To be sure, Eva O'Beirne is her best pupil, but then there are others nearly as good, although not quite; that is, their work wouldn't do for us, although other shopkeepers, not so particular, take all they can give them; really, ma'am, it has done more good that you can imagine, and gives quite a different look to the place. Here are the O'Beirnes now; well, the father was carried off by a fever three years ago, leaving a widow, a son, and two little girls, with only a bit of ground-a few acres-to support them, and an arrear of rent hanging over their head. I wish you could get Eva to tell her own story, ma'am-but she won't-and then you would hear what struggles they had to go through to keep body and soul together, until Phil got into the way of working the ground, which he never would have done, only that Eva, there, plied her fingers, night and day, and earned money enough to put the land into heart, as it is called." 
                  "God bless me! that little girl! only think of that, now;" said the lady. "Well, and now they are all comfortable, are they?" 
                  "They are better, ma'am, and were getting on quite nicely, and clearing off the arrears by degrees, but now again they are in a little trouble." 
                  "As how, pray? You quite interest me." 
                  "Their landlord is Sir Marmaduke Banbury, ma'am," went on the communicative milliner, "and as he lives away in England, it is Mr. Wilson, the new agent, manages his estate." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "Mr. Wilson is a very fair man, I believe, ma'am, only he is anxious to-to-con-something or other the farms-aye, consolidate is the word I wanted-to consolidate the farms, all for the benefit of his employer, of course, or he thinks so, at all events, as he is in duty bound to do; and so, he has given a number of the poorer tenants notice to quit, and they don't know where to go, or what to do, God help them! and so, to make a long story short, ma'am, the Widow O'Beirne and her family are noticed as well as the rest. To be sure, ma'am, it does seem hard, for Phil O'Beirne has worked night and day to get things into order-built a cow-shed, a pig-stye, and a stable, mostly with his own hands and Eva's earnings; and now to be shoved out, without rhyme or reason, and he better able than ever he was to pay the rent; but as I said before, Mr. Wilson is only doing his duty, and, maybe, it is Sir Marmaduke's orders, too--" 
                  "That is not likely, Mrs. Manning-not at all," interrupted Mrs. Butler Adair; "I know Sir Marmaduke Banbury well, and meet him often in London, and a more humane or charitable man I never was acquainted with." 
                  "Just so, ma'am," replied Mrs. Manning; "and it's well for those who can have the benefit of his charity and his humanity, which you know, ma'am, as he never comes here, except for a week or so in four or five years, no one here can have the benefit of, or know anything about." 
                  "Why, that is very true, too," said the lady, good-humouredly; "but his merits or demerits must not draw me away from my little lace-maker and her work. Put up what you happen to have of it, and send it up to Clermont Park for me, if you please, and I shall take care and speak of it to Lady Clermont. She deals with you, I suppose?" 
                  "When the family is here, ma'am, but that is only for a start in summer this way," replied the milliner. "Thank you, ma'am, you're very good, I'm sure, and we are all much obliged-Eva particularly. Make a curtsey, Eva; there's a good girl, and tell the lady how much obliged you are." 
                  "And come with me, Eva," said Mrs. Butler Adair, "as I want to chat to you a little about this lace, as we go along." 
                  So saying, the lady bowed to Mrs. Manning, and, accompanied by little Eva, left the shop. 
                  As they walked along, Mrs. Butler Adair put a number of questions to Eva, all of which were answered readily, though modestly. She explained the process by which her delicate work was done, and the great pains which the benevolent Sister Agnes had taken to instruct her in it, as well as to direct her mind in other and still more material things. Her companion then branched off into a different subject, and inquired about her family, their proceedings, and their trials. 
                  "I suppose, now," she said, "that you and your family think your landlord and his agent very hardhearted, tyrannical people, don't you?" 
                  "God forbid, ma'am," replied Eva, gravely; "my mother, and brother, and all of us, are in great trouble at the thoughts of leaving our home, for we don't rightly know where we are to look for another, but my mother says that every one has a right to do what they like with their own, and if Mr. Wilson thinks he can make more of the land--" 
                  "Stop a moment, if you please," interrupted Mrs. Butler Adair, as two gentlemen crossed the street to speak to her. "This young friend of mine and myself were just speaking about you, Sir Marmaduke," she went on, addressing the younger man of the two; "and before your friends and people of business hear that you have come on a visit to Clermont Park, I want to introduce her to you particularly, and, moreover, to interest you in her favour." 
                  Now, it so happened that Mrs. Butler Adair was a widow-young, handsome, and rich, and by those who knew them it was generally supposed that Sir Marmaduke Banbury not only had a great desire to make her Lady Banbury, but that he had followed her down to Clermont Park, the noble proprietor of which was her relative, in order to induce her to become so as soon as possible. 
                  "You know that your wishes are laws to me," replied the Baronet, "and that any friend of yours is sure to be an object of interest to me. Who is this little girl, may I ask?" 
                  "A tenant of yours, Eva O'Beirne by name," said the lady. 
                  "Indeed! And what can I do for her?" demanded Sir Marmaduke, smiling. 
                  "You can see her work and hear her story," replied Mrs. Butler Adair; "and in order that you may do so properly, I will tell you a little about her as we go along-that is, if you are disengaged for half an hour, and can accompany me while I pay a visit." 
                  "Am I privileged to be of the party?" asked Lord Clermont, who was Sir Marmaduke's companion. 
                  "By all means,", said the lively lady, "for as a proprietor prietor, you, my Lord, are interested in my young friend also." 
                  They turned and walked on, followed by Eva. 
                  "In the first place," went on Mrs. Butler Adair, "of course you both know that there is a society of pious ladies-nuns, in fact, who have taken great pains to instruct your tenantry in a new branch of industry, and have therefore tended to the improvement of your estates?" 
                  No-they had never heard anything about either the nuns or their exertions; not a word. 
                  "It is, nevertheless, a fact, Sir Marmaduke," she continued, "that, as I am credibly informed, the mother and brother of the pretty child behind us, for she is no more, were indebted to you in arrears of rent, which they have since gradually got rid of, owing to her ability to make a very delicate and beautiful kind' of lace, the art of doing which she was taught by a nun, and the profit of which has gone into your pocket. There is a little heroine for you!" 
                  "So she is, upon my word," said Sir Marmaduke, laughing, "and I am sure I am very much obliged to her for adding to my rental by her industry. But can I do anything for her in return?" 
                  "That is just what I want to try," was the reply; "you may remember that last night you spoke about your agent's new schemes or whims of improving your property, and said that you had received several letters and petitions about it?" 
                   
                  "So I did," answered Sir Marmaduke; "in fact, from what I have heard, I think Wilson is going too far, and it was that feeling which partly brought me down here, to make inquiries about the matter, and judge for myself. Wilson is a good fellow and a capital man of business, and means everything for the best; but I don't want money so much as to risk my character for humanity and my good name in search of it; and it would never do to have it said, that while I was living in luxury, a few scores of otherwise peaceable, industrious, and well-disposed men were cursing me in their hearts, and possibly starving while they did so, or little better, at all events. No, no, 'live and let live' is a very sensible maxim, both for landlord and tenant, and I should like to make it mine if I could. Lord Clermont and I were just on our way to Wilson's office to speak to him about it, when you were kind enough to say you wished us to accompany you. But what has all this to do with your interesting protege, may I ask?" 
                  "A great deal, I assure you," said the lady, smiling; "I am now on my way to visit her family, as the account I have received of her interests me, and I should like to judge for my- self whether it be exaggerated or not, in order that t might try and interest you also in their favour, should they deserve it. Besides, before you see your agent, it may be as well for you to see one of those with whom he proposes to deal, so that you may see with your own eyes rather than his, as when a man is anxious to ride a hobby of his own, it is wonderful how eloquent he can become in its favour." 
                  "You are quite right," said the Baronet, laughing; "for I do believe that if Wilson is not allowed to consolidate, as he calls it, it will drive him mad." 
                  "Yes, and if he is allowed, it may drive others into the same predicament," replied Mrs. Butler Adair; "so that you are bound to investigate the matter closely, in order to see whose reason is most worthy to be saved; for my own part, I hope that the tenants and non-consolidation will carry the day." 
                  "With Sir Marmaduke's high opinion of your talents and good sense," said Lord Clermont, "I have an idea that your opinions and wishes will materially influence his." 
                  "I am obliged to you for the compliment, my Lord," she answered; "and I hope they may-always provided, that he feels justified to himself in conforming to them." 
                  "I beg your pardon, ma'am," said Eva, coining forward, "but that gate yonder is ours, and maybe you would like me to tell my mother you were coming." 
                  "By all means, my little woman," the lady answered, "race away as fast as you can, and say that Sir Marmaduke Banbury and his, friends wish to speak a few words to her. We will wait here in this pretty garden, until you come to tell us we may enter." 
                   
                  With a blushing cheek and a palpitating heart, the little lace-worker sped forward, anxious, no doubt, to put everything in good order on so important an occasion. 
                  Meanwhile, Mrs. Butler Adair and her companions entered the little patch of garden which fronted the house, and which was very neatly kept, and amply stocked with flowers. The cottage was slated, and the walls were almost hidden with creeping plants, which were trained around the windows and door, and greatly added to their appearance. The beds of the garden were bordered with box, and the walks were of tesselated stones of different colours, which gave a gay appearance to the whole. Evidently it was not the residence of a sluggard, and Mrs. Butler Adair's hopes rose as she looked around her. 
                  "It is a pretty spot," she said, and, "with great respect for Mr. Wilson, looks almost as well as if it were consolidated into a grass farm, with cows and sheep, instead of men and women, gaining a subsistence from it. Look at this bed of carnations, Lord Clermont, and see how neatly tied they are; selfs, bizarres, and biblmens; I venture to say, that your head gardener could not show a finer. But here comes Eva." 
                  Yes, there came Eva, without her bonnet, and with a clean pinafore, looking a little flustered, but exceedingly pretty, as she blushed and curtsied, and said that her mother would be proud and happy to see them, and that Phil hoped they would forgive him for being in his working dress. 
                  They entered a little hall, to the right and left of which there were rooms, and at the bottom a door, which opened into the kitchen. The room to the right was the "parlour," and although its furniture was as plain as plain could be, still everything was as clean and tidy as hands could make them. Over the little chimney-piece hung a coloured print of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and near it were others of the Holy Family, of the taking down from the cross, and of St. Patrick banishing venomous reptiles from his beloved "Island of Saints." In the room, a little flushed by excitement, stood Mrs. O'Beirne, a meek-eyed, matronly looking woman, and her son Phil, now about nineteen years of age, and standing nearly six feet high in his stocking feet. 
                  "I met your little daughter by chance at Mrs. Manning's, the milliner's," commenced Mrs. Butler Adair, "and as I particularly admired the lace she has made, and would like to have more of it, I came in here to speak to you and her about it, Mrs. O'Beirne. On my way I met Sir Marmaduke Banbury and Lord Clermont, and as Sir Marmaduke wishes to speak to you also, he was good enough to accompany me. First about the lace, however, I should desire, of all things, to see how it is done, if you will be good enough to explain it to me." 
                  "With the greatest pleasure, ma'am," replied Mrs. O'Beirne, cheerfully; "but as it was Eva taught us, and she knows all about it, may be it might be more satisfactory if she were to do it, for shell make it clearer to you than I could." 
                  "As you please." 
                  "Take the lady into the room beyond, Eva dear," said her mother, "and just show them how you work. I'm sure it's a blessing it has been to all of us, and we never omit praying for the good sister Agnes who brought it amongst us. If she had only a fortune as big as her heart, there wouldn't be a morsel of poverty in the world, I believe." 
                  "This praise of the nun must please you, cousin," whispered Lord Clermont, "as you are Puseyite, you know." 
                  "Nay, I have got farther than that, my Lord, as you Too shall know hereafter," said the lady. 
                  "What! are you going to leave us?" he said, in some surprise. 
                  "I like to follow the example of my betters," replied she, "and where so many, who were formerly accounted the shining lights of the Protestant Church, have turned their backs upon it for ever, I think I cannot do better than do as they have done, and anchor my hope on the rock, of ages, rather than on the absurd structure which Luther projected and Henry baptized in blood. But let us hear what Eva has got to say about her pretty work, which looks as fairy like as herself." 
                   
                  It was not for nothing little Eva had got the title of sister Agnes' crack pupil, and having learned the art perfectly, she found no difficulty in explaining it. Nothing could be more modest or respectful than her manner and demeanour, but where the mind is full the tongue grows eloquent, and so, for half an hour or more, she went on in a species of lecture, explaining, and demonstrating, and showing how the work progressed from the rough material, until, at last, it was fitted to adorn the person of a queen (and of a good queen too); and all this with an earnest simplicity of speech, which was quite as pleasant to hear, as the substance of the lecture itself. 
                  "By Jove!" exclaimed Sir Marmaduke, "I never thought there could be half so much said, or, at least, so well said, on lace-making before. Only that my fingers are too clumsy, I have an idea that I should turn to the trade myself." 
                  "I dare say Eva will be quite as well content if you only patronize it," replied Mrs. Butler Adair, laughing. 
                  "Yes, and if, for her sake, he extends his patronage to her family generally, it will be the best reward he could bestow on her for her very interesting explanation," said Lord Clermont, significantly. 
                  When they returned to the little parlour they found the deal table covered with a coarse but white cloth, and a little "lunch" spread, consisting of fresh milk and butter, and a cake of home-made bread, with some green gage plums, some splendid looking pears, and a large melon, to which Mrs. O'Beirne invited them, with many apologies that she had no better to offer them. 
                  "Make no apologies, my good madam," said Lord Clermont, seating himself, and cutting into the cake at once; "I am as hungry as a hawk, and as good wine, they say, needs no bush, so good bread and butter requires no apologist. Let me help you, cousin, to a slice; you will find it delicious, I promise you." 
                  In the course of the meal, exceedingly enjoyed by the party, it came out that the fruit was the product of their own garden. Phil had a melon bed, the product of which he sold in the neighbouring country town, and his pears and plums he brought to market when he went there with eggs, butter, and fowl. In his way he was nearly as quick-witted as little Eva herself, although he acknowledged that she helped him a great deal in the garden, and that the flowers were all her own. 
                  "I mean to make love to some of her carnations," said Mrs. Butler Adair," and as she has already given me a lecture on lace-making, I hope to have another from her, some day soon, on carnation-growing, for they are beautiful." 
                  "We will all come and listen to her," said Sir Marmaduke, "always taking it for granted that her good mother will treat us to just such another feast after we have heard it. And now," he went on, turning to Phil, "let me ask you a question or two about your holding, my friend. You are aware that I am your landlord, I suppose?" 
                  "I am, sir," replied Phil, with a bow. 
                  "How many acres do you hold?" 
                  "Three and twenty and a rood, sir." 
                  "For which you pay-what?" 
                  "Thirty shillings an acre, sir." 
                  "Do you find it easy to pay your rent?" 
                  "Just now I do, sir, because the land is in heart; but we have Eva and sister Agnes to thank for that-and because the seasons have been good, the Lord be praised, and the markets have been good also." 
                  "But you have arrears to clear off; how is that?" 
                  "Not much now, sir," replied Phil; "only seven pound ten, which I am preparing for against the next gale-day. I could have cleared it off last, only I had a barn to build and a liquid manure tank to sink, besides--" 
                  "Quite enough, my good friend," interrupted Sir Marmaduke; "Fortunatus's purse cannot spring out of three and twenty acres of land, and I only wonder you could do so much with it." 
                  "Eva, sir, helped us, you know--" 
                  "Oh! true, Eva is the good fairy who seems to help everybody," said Sir Marmaduke. "Well, and you have been noticed to quit the farm by Mr. Wilson, have you not?" 
                  "We-have, sir," replied Phil, with a dejected air, and a deep sigh, which he smothered with a cough. 
                   
                  "You think that hard, I suppose? You do not understand, I dare say, that the country in general would be better off if there were no such things as small farms at all." 
                  "I-I can't say, sir; only, if you please, how are the people to live?" said Phil. 
                  "You must ask Mr. Wilson that," replied Sir Marmaduke, "for he is a political economist and I am not; he thinks that more blades of grass, and more sheep and oxen could be made to grow then than there are now; but I am afraid he forgets that while the grass is growing, and the cattle getting fat, the people may be getting thin; and that by the time his views were carried out, the population would be growing in some other country, where men and women rank higher than blades of grass or fat cattle. Even as it is, they are going, and by-and-by, should war overtake us, even in a political sense, we may find the want of them. I dare say you would fight for old Ireland yourself, if any foreigner invaded it?" 
                  "Of course I would, sir," answered Phil; "no one deserves credit for that, surely." 
                  "Well, and if you are obliged to leave this, what will you do, and where will you go?" asked Sir Marmaduke. 
                  "We have been turning that over in our minds, sir," replied Phil, "and we all think-Eva and all of us-that the best thing we can do is to go try our fortunes in America." 
                   
                  "Just so-there it is-exactly the answer I expected," said Sir Marmaduke, turning to Lord Clermont; "by-and-by, America will have the beat of us, and send us her cattle and corn in exchange for our men and women, and if we should come to a quarrel, fight us with our own blood relations, too. Wilson is a deucedly clever fellow, I dare say, but I have my doubt whether this plan of his of consolidation is a feather in his cap, after all; I must look a little deeper into the matter before I give a sanction to it." 
                  "Clever as he is," said Mrs. Butler Adair, with a smile, "I think we must all acknowledge that sister Agnes beats him hollow on the score of utility-to say nothing of humanity, which he throws overboard altogether. The only way he can think of, in order to increase the prosperity of the country, is to change the farmer into a labourer, and the poor man into something still poorer; now she, I dare say, knows nothing of political economy at all; but she is perfectly conversant with the great book of charity, and its inculcations, and so she travels into Belgium-and I am sure she would have travelled to the end of the world on the same holy mission-and she brings back with her the means of turning Eva there, child as she is, into an artist, by whose skill our national character is raised, and by whose earnings, Mr. Wilson's own balance-sheet looks much pleasanter in his own eyes, at the year's end, than it would otherwise have done. There's the difference between them, you see, gentlemen. Mr. Wilson lives to please Sir Marmaduke Banbury, and to serve himself by doing so; Sister Agnes lives only to serve God and benefit her neighbour, without thinking of herself at all, and yet in doing so, she happens to pay off Sir Marmaduke's arrears, by the agency of her little pupil, and to confound Mr. Wilson's notions of political economy, by proving that 'where there's a will there's a way,' and that to instruct the people of a country and to find them employment is better-far better, than to reconvert that country into a desert, where cattle roam in comfort, leaving those who preceded them to roam in search of it to other far off countries, where the Wilsons of the world are unknown, and where wiser men soon find them comforts equal to those of the cattle they have left at home. Come, shall we go? We must not keep Eva and her brother from their work, while we discuss the merits of rival systems, at the expense of those who have better things to do." 
                  Before they went, however, the gentlemen accompanied Phil into his little farm-yard, where they found four milch cows comfortably housed-a house, in good condition-five or six pigs, looking as sleek and sleepy as well fed pigs always do-a dozen of hens and ducks, and a pet lamb, called Eva, which came to be fed out of their hands when it was spoken to. Before they left, Lord Clermont begged from Phil a Spanish cock and hen, which he seemed particularly to admire, and in exchange for it insisted on the young farmer's acceptance of a heifer, the breed of which was first-rate, and which he was sure would turn out well in such industrious and capable hands. 
                  Sir Marmaduke said little, and offered nothing; but he registered a vow in his own mind, that Mr. Wilson's famous scheme of consolidation should never have a chance, and if Mr. Wilson did not like to go on in the old way rather than the new, that he might throw up his office as soon as he liked. 
                  And all these good feelings and kindly intentions were, in a great measure, brought about by the industry and intelligence of our little Eva. Let no one say that children have no power. We are all accountable beings, and from the moment we can distinguish good from evil, it is our duty, and ought to be our pleasure, to be diligent in our several callings, and while taking care always humbly to walk in the love and fear of our Heavenly Father, never to lose the opportunities given us by our earthly parents and guardians, to cultivate those talents which He has bestowed upon us, so as that we may be able to assist ourselves and others, and thus avoid not alone becoming a burthen to our friends or to society, but be able to spare something for those who really want it instead. 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  BUT the good which this clever and amiable little girl did ended not here. Mrs. Butler Adair, when she left the house of Mrs. O'Beirne, soon after parted from her companions, and deeply interested by the character she had heard of the benevolent nun, and with admiration for her charitable labours in the cause of humanity, proceeded to pay her a visit, and to introduce herself. She found her in the school-room, which was a workroom as well, surrounded by at least fifty poor female children of various ages, many of whom were engaged in the lace manufacture, while others, under the direction of five or six other pious ladies of the same I order, were employed at their books, or writing, or at plain-work of one sort or other. It was a charming sight to witness these devoted women, all highly accomplished, and many of them of the first Catholic families in Ireland, thus administering to the wants of their fellow-creatures, instructing the ignorant, elevating the lowly, and so directing the tender minds of these young creatures, that their welfare, both here and hereafter, might be said to depend on the principles which were now with such pains and anxiety instilled day after day, and all day long, into their hearts. And then the air of serene and holy peace which reigned over all! Mrs. Butler Adair was received at once as a friend by Sister Agnes, who took great delight in explaining to her the simple machinery with which her wonders were wrought, and the pleasant and profitable proficiency which so many of her pupils evinced in the art. On the subject of Eva O'Beirne, the good nun was enthusiastic, and spoke of her with a maternal tenderness which sensibly touched her visitor's heart. 
                  "Day after day, and night after night," she said, "the little creature laboured, first to learn, and then to serve those who were dear to her, by the knowledge she had gained. And God has blessed her, and Our Blessed Lady, whose child she is, has guarded and guided her, until the ambition of her innocent life has been gratified, and her family have become free from debt and comfortable, principally through her means. I am proud of Eva; she is my friend, my pupil, my dear child, and if you are interested in her, madam, I venture to pledge myself that she will never disgrace your kindness or my recommendation-never." 
                  During the remaining time of her visit, Mrs. Butler Adair occupied herself in consulting the good sister with concerns material to her own meditated change, and deeply versed as the pious nun was in the doctrines of our holy faith, she greatly strengthened the mind of her hearer by the clear, lucid, and unimpassioned way in which she explained the truths of her own creed, and exposed the fallacy of those protesters, who conceive, in the miserable vanity of their own hearts, that they are competent to deal with those abstruse doctrines and mysterious revelations which have occupied the attention and stimulated the genius of the greatest men and most profound Christian thinkers the world ever saw:- 
                  "Depart from the Catholic faith," Sister Agnes said, in conclusion, u and whither will you go in your trials, or to what tribunal will you apply in your difficulties with a reasonable chance of solving or overstepping them? High church, or low church, it is all alike; new expounders of God's Word arise, and, guided by what they call their 'reason,' gather about them a crowd of fools who feed their presumptuous pride, and satisfy their wants; but by-and-by the hollowness of the idol becomes evident, and then Luther is deserted for Calvin, and Calvin for Wesley, and Wesley for Fox, and Fox for Darby, and Darby for Mormon or Johanna Southcote, as they will be whenever a greater impostor may arise to give 'new readings' to the Scriptures, and travestie God's own Word by the impious breathings of their unholy lips. Christ said that there should be but ONE Church, and unless the whole world should be in a conspiracy of falsehood, that Church, founded by Him, has existed since His days, and been true to His teachings, from the moment His divine lips so solemnly assured Peter, that he was the rock upon which the Christian Church should be built, and that the gates of hell should hot prevail against it; giving unto it the power to loose and to bind; investing it with an almost divine prerogative, nay, the very 'keys of the kingdom of heaven' itself. In God's own good time all these wanderers will see their errors, and return, as so many thousands are now doing, yourself, madam, amongst the rest, and until then the Holy Catholic Church, against which so many open attempts and secret machinations have, for centuries, been hurled, will proceed on its great mission, divinely accredited, and laughing to scorn the attempts of those who may strip it of its earthly inheritance, but never can deprive it of the INFALLIBLE SEAL which the words of Christ himself have stamped upon it with his heavenly breath." 
                  Mrs. Butler Adair took leave of her new friends with a chastened spirit and a softened heart, wonderfully comforted by the explanations and exhortations of the pious nun, and well-nigh overpowered with shame at the contrast afforded by her own life as compared with this exemplary woman. "And yet," she said to herself, as she walked along, "these are the females over whose actions and lives bigots and fanatics, of an opposing creed, would establish a system of harassing and insulting espionage, if they dare, at once odious, unmanly, uncharitable, and unchristianlike; they feed the hungry, they clothe the naked, they instruct the ignorant, tearless of pestilence, unmoved by danger, undeterred by toil, and yet with these unmistakeable guarantees for purity of heart, and excellence of life, there are men-gentlemen, who have the hardihood to launch forth implications and inuendoes against them, year after year, even in the very presence of the noble and the dignified of the land, who could crush their ribald efforts with derision, and do not, or, at best, who only laugh at their folly, when graver marks of reprobation ought to mark their infamous attempts." 
                  Meanwhile, at Clermont Castle, little Eva and her workmanship formed the main topics of the after-dinner talk. Her work was exhibited, her efforts canvassed, her intelligence praised, and her family prospects considered. Mr. Wilson, the agent, was one of the guests; and although he struggled hard to stand his ground and ride his favourite hobby, still the nuns and their "crack" pupil were too much for him, and triumphantly carried the day. 
                  "You have an eye for the picturesque, rather than the practical, after all, Mr. Wilson," said Mrs. Butler Adair, in her good-humoured way; "you require a landscape unbroken by any other objects than flocks of sheep and droves of cattle, with, here and there, a herd or two to take care of them, and who are content to do so for the sum of sixpence or eightpence a-day. But your imagination misleads you, as it has misled hundreds like you; the earth is made for the use of men and women, as well as of beasts; and of the two, even you must admit that the former are the nobler race. By all means improve the breed of your Leicesters and Durhams, but, for heaven's sake! do not extirpate our Evas and our Philips in doing so:- 
                         
                           "Sad is the land, to the worst ills a prey, 
                           Where cattle thrive, and only men decay." 
                        
                     
                   
                   
                  The gentlemen laughed at the lively lady's paraphrase, all but Mr. Wilson himself, who resumed his argument. 
                  "But you mistake me, madam," he said, gravely; "I think that my scheme would both develope and increase the resources of the soil and of the country, and improve the condition of the people as well. In England it has done so, for instance." 
                  "And in France and the Continent it has not, simply because it has never been attempted," replied his opponent. "Besides, England is not Ireland, and what may do very well there, would never do here at all. In England, there is a large resident proprietary, who have capital to work their estates properly, and who have never had to contend with the evils, as you call them, of a cottier class of farmers, since they and their forefathers came into possession of the land. But is it so in Ireland? Look round you, and answer. Moreover, in England, you have a bond of sympathy between landlord and occupier, which has a beneficial influence on both. They are both of the same religion, in nine cases out often both of the same politics; but here it is the reverse." 
                  "Well, but, in the present state of things, what are you to do with them, madam?" asked Mr. Wilson. 
                  "What has sister Agnes done with them?" said Mrs. Butler Adair, slyly and smilingly; "employment, and not eviction or expatriation, is evidently her motto, at all events; and yet she is only a woman, and a poor one, too; never had a tenant or an acre in her life, probably; but if she had not the wealth of Mammon, or the desire to possess it, she had the grace of God, and the Christian's anxiety to fulfil His commands, and to lay up treasures for herself in His kingdom, when earth, and all that makes it even more earthly than it is already to the human heart, shall have passed away. Do with them? Let Sir Marmaduke Banbury and Lord Clermont make her their agent, if they can get her to be so, even for a year-a month-and you'll soon see what she and her sisterhood will do with them.? Do with them? Go to Philip O'Beirne's cottage to-morrow, and look at little Eva at work, and judge for yourself whether they are not happier under her direction-for it is she has been their guiding star-than they would be under yours, when instead of being desired to pay up their rent and leave the land, they are given the means to do the one, and encouraged to make the other ten times more valuable than it was before." 
                  "Still, I must respectfully insist, madam, that my theory--" 
                  "Looks well on paper, and is deplorably deficient in practice, Wilson," interrupted Sir Marmaduke Ban-bury, interfering in the conversation; "I always doubted it, and now I am done with it for ever. I give you my honour, I never was more heartily ashamed in my life than I was this day, when I heard that fine little creature, in her simple way, give me a lecture on the fine arts-for it amounted to that-and when, afterwards, the hospitality of her family was showered upon me, according to their means; on me, who had been pocketing the amount of their labour for years, and yet knew them not even by sight; on me, who was expected to permit of their being driven from their home, and sent forth to starve or prosper, as the case might be; on me, who must have appeared in their eyes only in the light of a selfish and avaricious man, who grasped all and returned none-no, not even the sympathy of good wishes to cheer them on their difficult way. No, no, no; let the word 'consolidation' be banished henceforth from your vocabulary, Wilson, or else make up your accounts at once, and 'never more be officer of mine.' Neither you nor I are too old to learn, my good friend, and the best thing we can do is to take a lesson out of the book of this Lady of Loretto, who, solely by the aid of her handmaids, Religion and Benevolence, has enlisted science and art in her train, and tutored them into becoming benefactors to the humble and assistants to all. But this cannot be done in a hurried visit, by me, at all events, so I think I shall prolong my stay in Ireland, and give up my German excursion for this year. Banbury Hall has capabilities, so we'll consolidate our powers on making it comfortable and fit to entertain our friends, and we'll let all other kinds of consolidation work their wicked will somewhere else." 
                   
                  Mr. Wilson was much too shrewd and prudent a man to gainsay the wishes of the lord of the soil, from whom he received a very comfortable salary, indeed, so he bent his head to the storm, and promised to carry out his employer's new views as earnestly as he would have done his own. When this was all settled, Lord Clermont spoke:- 
                  "Do you know," he said, "that I am greatly tempted to follow your example, Banbury. I am tired wandering, year after year, in search of pleasure and novelty, which I never find, after all, and probably which I may find much nearer home, if I once seriously set about looking for them. If I can only get Lady Clermont to consent--" 
                  "Lady Clermont will be only too happy to stay where she is, I promise you," said her ladyship, answering for herself. "You know I always told you that your Irish estate was well worth locking after, and, to my knowledge, your cousin, Mrs. Butler Adair--" 
                  "Aye, aye, so you did, and so did she too;" interjected the good-natured but somewhat indolent peer; "it was two to one against me, and so it is no wonder if I have come round at last. But, I don't know how it was, I had an idea that things were in a much more higgledy piggledy state here (excuse the term), than I discover them to be. There is a great deal to be done, to be sure, but then when one labours it will be, with the pleasant consciousness that you are serving your own interest, and helping others as well, and that as 'the eye of the master maketh the horse fat,' so does the supervision of the landlord make his tenantry punctual in payment, by finding them the means to become so. But I won't promise to stay in the country if Mrs. Butler Adair quits it," he went on, laughing; "she has found us out one or two lumps of pure gold already, and by-and-by, if she persists, who knows but we shall have a Golconda or California of our own." 
                  Mrs. Butler said nothing, nor neither did Sir Marmaduke Banbury-at least just then; but he chose his own opportunity, during the evening, to follow Mrs. Butler Adair into another room, and before they left it, that right-minded and good-hearted woman had promised to second his good intentions, and carry out his views, as the mistress of Banbury Hall. 
                  Great, indeed, was the joy of the whole neighbourhood, when it was understood that the two leading proprietors were no longer absentees, and that changes of great moment were contemplated by both, not, however, to dispossess their tenantry, but to increase their comforts and give them (what they only wanted) "a fair field and no favour," in order to show what they could do. Consolidation and eviction were no more heard of, but, in their place, a new revision of rents took place, and we are tempted to give a short extract or two from the little speech which Sir Marmaduke made to his tenants, when he gave them new leases at long periods, instead of their old, and entertained them in his noble hall, previous to his doing so:- 
                  "Every man may do what he likes with his own," he said, "and, therefore, I follow the maxim, by giving you all new leases on a new plan. At present, you nave no temptation to improve your holdings, or better yourselves by bettering the soil at the same time. You put your savings in a stocking or a savings' bank, but you do not sink it in the soil, and you would be fools if you did, when you have no law to protect you or it from the grasp of your landlord, when your lease runs out, or when you happen to be behindhand with your rent. I hope that from this day out this fear of consequences will exist no longer. I have done my best to prevent it, and the task is not difficult, if it is only looked fairly in the face. I know the value of your farms as they stand, every acre of them; it is jotted down in this book. From this day forth every shilling you expend on them shall be not mine but your own; I will have my rent, and I mean to insist on it, because I give you the land on terms which will enable you to pay it; but I shall ask no more than my rent, because I am not entitled to it; if you build a better house, or drain your ground, or improve the staple of the soil, you effect permanent improvements, which benefit me as well as you, and which I ought to encourage you to effect by every means in my power. The richer the soil, the more it will grow; plenty brings peace, and comforts and enlightenment travel hand in hand; you will have the means to educate your children, to employ the labourer, to pay your taxes cheerfully, to keep down poor rates, and you will pray to God for me, instead of shooting] at me from behind a hedge, and thereby disgracing your country and destroying yourselves. I have no fear for you-I have no fear for myself. We will go to work harmoniously together. Henceforth I cannot be your foe, even if I desired it, so long as you are honest and industrious men; I have deprived myself of the power, and you can now be as independent as every man deserves to be, whose labours contribute to the welfare of society and the general good. Doubtless, I have still duties to perform-for when the Almighty gave me a rich inheritance, he never intended that I should waste it in idle extravagance, when His law points out to me, and all men, how wealth should be used-but these, too, I shall do my best not to lose sight of, so that when I lie on my dying bed, I may petition for mercy with a clean heart, since I trust I will have shown it to others in a true spirit, and with a Christian wish to do unto others as I would that they should do unto me." 
                  Let us turn now to Eva. Eva was the happiest lace-worker of which any history ever made mention. Her darling Phil's farm was safe, her darling mother's home was preserved, her darling father's grave could still be visited and prayed over, and her darling sister Agnes was made as happy as herself by having the purse of Lady Banbury and Lady Clermont always at her command, to increase her own utility and to assist the poor, whom, next to her God, she studied most to serve. Still more, Eva had the happiness to witness the reception of her kind friend into the bosom of the Church of Christ, and to know that her example and admonition were quietly preparing the way for her dearest friends to adopt the same course. Finally, Eva herself is now the right-hand woman of both Lady Clermont and Lady Banbury in all their charitable schemes, and might reside with either of them, if she chose, only that Phil and her mother still require her, and would miss her too much, even to think of parting from them, or the pleasant home which she loves so well.
