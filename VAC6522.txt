            GERTRUDE MORGAN. 
             
               THE experience of this accomplished lady, a native of New York City, during the past eleven years, nearly all of which time she has lived among the Indians of the Far West, by whom she was captured in 1855, is, perhaps, one of the most thrilling and romantic that has ever been given to the public. The narrative, the reliability of which is unquestionable, is written by Mrs. Morgan herself, and has just been put, by the fair authoress, into the hands of the editor, who, with the exception of here and there introducing an explanatory paragraph or sentence, has made no alteration whatever in it. 
             
             
               A full detailed account of my early history would, as far as the object of this narrative is concerned, be of no consequence to the general reader, and I shall, therefore, pass it with but a casual allusion. 
               Born of wealthy parents in New York City, I experienced, from the time of my birth up to my twentieth year, none of those ills, or vicissitudes, or trials, which fall to the lot of so many. My doting father and mother, who had no other child but myself, lavished upon me all that heart could wish for, and yet guided my inclinations and disposition so gently and skillfully in the right direction, that I escaped the result so generally brought about by parental indulgence, that of becoming a spoiled child. At the time of which I speak, however-my twentieth year-the cloudless, azure sky, that had hitherto smiled so brightly upon my life path, suddenly became obscured. My father, by an unfortunate speculation, failed in his business, lost all he had, and in a single day became a penniless man. 
               This fearful reverse of fortune so deeply affected my mother, that in a very short time after its occurrence, we were called on to follow her to the tomb, where, thank Heaven, worldly trouble at last terminates. My father never looked up from that day out, and in less than a year from the time that the green sods were placed on my mother's grave, I laid him beside her, whom he had so dearly loved. Of all the hosts of friends who had smiled upon me when 
                     surronnded
                     surrounded
                   by affluence, there was only one who then, in the moment of my adversity, stood with me and wept over my father's coffin, as the attendants lowered it gently in its dusty resting place: and this one friend was William Morgan, who had, for several years, been my father's confidential clerk. 
               For sometime previous, there had existed between us a mutual feeling of affection, which had continually increased in strength until this sorrowful day, on which we vowed to live only for each other. In about two weeks after my father's funeral, William obtained a situation, at a moderate salary, and we were, soon after, united in the holy bonds of wedlock. Although reduced to such humble circumstance, when compared to those in which I had passed the previous part of my life, yet I was very happy-happy as the day was long, in the love of my dear husband, whose unalloyed affection for me seemed to grow more and more intense. 
               We had been married about nine months, when the California Gold Fever reached such a height that thousands were emigrating to the new El Dorado, with brilliant expectations of untold wealth. For a long time William had resisted its influence; but at length he became so imbued with the idea of building up a speedy fortune, that he obtained my consent to his departure for the land of gold, concerning which, the papers were daily giving such dazzling accounts. 
               It did not occupy him more than a week to make the necessary preparations for his journey; and on the 7th of May, 1850, he bade me farewell, and started for the modern Ophir. Until the beginning of June I received letters from him nearly every day, each one dated father and farther West, until at last he wrote me, that when I should get another letter he could not tell, as he was just about to plunge, with a party of companions, into the boundless, prairie wilderness that laid between him at Chouteau's Landing, or Station, and the Rocky Mountains. Chouteau's Station was about twelve or fifteen miles west of the Missouri, and close to the right bank of the Kansas river. 
               Once more before he reached California, I heard from him, and after that I got no word for many long months: in fact I had begun to have misgivings whether or no he was alive, when I received an epistle, crumpled and stained with travel, but oh, how welcome, informing me that he was not only still living, but in capital health and spirits, and making money rapidly. In it he stated that his realizations had already nearly equalled his utmost hopes, and, as an earnest of this, informed me in what manner to dispose, to the best advantage, of nearly five hundred dollars in gold dust, which would arrive some three or four weeks later. The next message I got, he was doing an extensive and lucrative business in Sacramento. This time he sent word also to his brother James, in Philadelphia, to come out and join him the next summer. He had now been absent four years, and did not expect to return, even on a visit, for some three years yet. 
               This seemed a long, long time to be separated from my dear husband, and, as I perused his letter over and over again, a new idea sprang to life within me: why could I not go to him? True, there were dangers to be faced, hardships to be encountered, and obstacles to be surmounted in the execution of such an intention, but I feared them not, and, ere I closed the letter, my resolution was fixed. 
               The next day I went on to Philadelphia and had an interview with my brother-in-law, James, who, upon learning my intentions, endeavored to dissuade me from such an hazardous undertaking, but in vain. Upon finding my determination unalterable, he consented that I should accompany him the following May, (1855) at which time we accordingly started to join William. 
               In due season we arrived in St. Louis, where we were detained a few days waiting for the arrival of some six or eight adventurers who were to fill up our little company to its full number of forty, including, beside myself, two other females, one of whom, like me, was going out for the purpose of joining her husband in California. When thirty-eight of the party had arrived, it was unanimously agreed to wait no longer for the other two, but to push forward immediately. 
               This being decided, we were soon steaming up the mighty highway of the West, and after a voyage of about four hundred miles, we reached, without accident, Chouteau's Landing. Here we rested two days for the purpose of completing all our arrangements before committing ourselves to the wilderness. 
               At dawn of the day on which we commenced our journey we were aroused, and, after taking breakfast, we struck off into the deep forests that belt the Kansas river. During our progress through these forests we often came upon cultivated farms and clearings, many of which belonged to Indians. We were guided by one of these Indian farmers for thirty or forty miles until we emerged upon the prairies. The latter came in view just at sunset of the third day, and of all the scenes or scenery that I ever beheld, that which then burst upon my view was the grandest I ever contemplated. 
               From our feet the ocean of grass swept far, far away Westward, in beautiful, swelling billows of verdure, that, moving gently to and fro in the evening breezes, and, being gilded with the deep rays of the descending sun, looked like moulten gold and emerald. Rooted to the spot in which I stood, I gazed in admiration until the sun sank out of sight among the distant grassy waves, and a melancholy, bluish mist rose over the boundless prairie, like an almost intangible vail. And even then, as the starry host overhead came glistening into the firmament, I continued my wrapt contemplation templation until aroused by James, who, with a joke and a laugh, passed my arm through his and led me away to our tent for supper. 
               We resumed our journey the next morning about seven or eight o'clock, all the time between that hour and daylight being consumed in grazing the animals we had with us, and obtaining our own breakfast. Halting an hour or two at noon for rest and refreshment, we again set forward and camped before sunset on the banks of a romantic stream. We soon reached the dangerous locality of hostile Indians, and thenceforward our little party was subjected to almost military regularity and discipline. Every night the horses and mules and oxen were driven in and picketed, and our wagons so arranged as to afford us a shelter or barricade, from behind which we could repel any attack that might be made upon us. 
               Three or four of the party in turn were also detailed each night to perform the duty of sentinels, and thus prevent us from being surprised. At first we journied along the regular Santa F Trail, but learning that the savages were likely to be more numerous and troublesome than usual in this direction, our leader, who had crossed the plains in 1842 with Captain (now General) John C. Fremont, determined to turn aside, reach, and advance over the former route of that indefatigable officer. 
               Up to the third week in June we met with nothing calculated to discourage us, but about this time a circumstance occurred that threw a gloom over our little party and inaugurated a series of mishaps and disasters which subsequently took place. 
               Two men, relatives of each other, went a little distance up the banks of the Vermillion river for a hunt or excursion. They remained away but a short time, and on their return resumed a quarrel that had sprung up between them just after setting out. Awhile before we took up our afternoon march they became so incensed that blows were exchanged. 
               In an instant more each drew his knife, and clenched in mortal combat with his adversary. Oh, what a horrible sight was it to see those stalwart, powerful men reeling, stumbling and wrestling about, each endeavoring to gain the advantage. How it curdled the blood to see their deadly weapons cutting and slashing each other's flesh, and now and then plunged with strange, shuddering quiver deeply into one another's body. It was impossible, without much peril, to interfere with the combatants, and so the contest continued until both men, cut, hacked and stabbed literally to pieces, fell dying to the turf which was already crimsoned with their blood. And even now it required the united strength of several men to tear them from their deadly embrace. 
               The one who was most badly injured died within a few minutes, and his livid features were distorted with a scowl of agony and rage, with a curse on his lips, his soul was ushered into the presence of that Being whose law he had so broken. The survivor lingered until sunset, and then died with words of contrition and sorrow upon his tongue, crying to be forgiven for the fearful deed he had committed. 
               The next morning we buried the two dead foes side by side in a wild ravine, through which dashed a small but turbulent stream. To prevent the wolves from tearing out their bodies and devouring them, a huge red sandstone boulder, of which numbers were lying around, was rolled upon their graves, and on it was rudely graved their names and the date of their deaths. 
               This sad duty performed we once more moved on our way, but not in our usual good spirits. A deep gloom settled upon us all, and more than one predicted "bad luck" throughout the rest our journey. I never was, nor can I say that I am now, a believer in "luck," either good or bad, but a singular fatality, that attended our steps from that day forth, seemed to bear out the superstitious predictions made on the occasion. Our oxen died suddenly, as did also several of our horses, three or four of our wagons broke down, and finally, after being mended again and again, had to be abandoned with nearly all their contents. 
               By the time we were about to leave our course along the left or Northern bank of the Little Blue, we found ourselves in the most deplorable condition. Still we pushed onward, fervently hoping the while for some propitious change of fortune, and we had nearly reached the Platte or Nebraska river, when we met a party of four hunters or trappers, who brought us the startling intelligence that a large war party of Pawnee Indians were in the neighborhood. After a hurried and immediate consultation it was resolved that, as it would be impossible for us to advance with any hope of success, we should forthwith return in company with our new companions, who were bound for St. Louis. We, therefore, retraced our steps until we reached our last night's camp, situated on the margin of the Little Blue. 
               Here we remained until the next morning, when we were in motion by seven o'clock, but had only travelled about two miles, when we were thrown into a terrible excitement by the shout of "Indians! Indians!" I can scarcely describe my feelings, as, after listening to the blood-curdling stories of the trappers, who had joined us the preceding afternoon, I now heard that wild cry of alarm. My eager eyes ranged up and down the luxuriant valley, through which the stream ran, and then over and along the verdant slopes of the hills. Not seeing any living thing, with the exception of a few antelopes that were bounding along in the distance, I was beginning to congratulate myself that the alarm was a false one. But I had scarcely arrived at this partial and too hasty conclusion, when, over the crest of a ridge, about three-quarters of a mile distant, I beheld a party of savages, stripped to the waist, and mounted on fleet horses, dash into sight. 
               As they discovered us, they uttered a deafening yell, and halted, apparently rently to reconnoitre our position and strength. A moment more, and several other companies of our dusky foes, galloping over the hill-tops, joined their companions, when they all proceeded to hold a council of war. But while I was gazing, horror struck, upon the enemy, the gleaming of whose guns and spears chilled my blood, I felt myself lifted quickly from the ground, and was carried to one of the wagons in which I was hurriedly placed for shelter during the coming battle. It was my brother-in-law, James, and one of the four hunters who had thus cared for my safety 
               "Be calm, Gertrude," said the former, in a low, anxious tone, "be calm, and do not attempt to get out until I come to you. I think we can beat them off yet." 
               With these words the speaker turned away to assist in the general defense. The wagons had been quickly arranged, so as to afford our party a barricade, from behind which they might defend themselves to the best advantage. 
               The expected attack was not long delayed, for the savages, having soon decided upon their plan, came dashing down upon us with the most deafening yells and whoops. But our men stood nobly to their work, and a volley from their deadly rifles emptied several saddles and caused the foe to retreat. There is no doubt also that had the Indians, notwithstanding their vast superiority in numbers been armed with only their regular weapons-bows and spears-they would have been speedily and effectually repulsed; but nearly half of them carrying rifles, they were enabled before withdrawing, to return our fire, and with such effect, that two of our force fell dead on the spot, while fully six or eight were more or less wounded. 
               I have often read glowing accounts of parties of three, four, or half a dozen white men defeating fifty and even a hundred savages at once, but never took into consideration the fact-generally omitted also by the authors-that the savages were without fire arms, while the whites carried both guns and pistols. Experience has taught me, however, that a long Missouri rifle, in the hands of an Indian warrior, makes him entirely the equal, nay, oftentimes his superior. 
               The Indians now divided into three companies, and while two of these prepared for a second charge upon us, the third passed out of view behind a wooded ridge, doubtless intending to make a circuit and come in upon our rear. In this emergency, our leader determined to cross the stream at our side, and reach if possible, a position on the opposite bank where we could better offer battle than in our present exposed situation. At a given signal, therefore, the wagons, of which we had three left, suddenly wheeled, and started at full speed into the water. Before the Indians recovered from their astonishment at this bold and unexpected manuvre, two of the wagons gained the other bank in safety, but the third, in which I was, had no more than reached the middle of the stream, when the savages, galloping within range, fired upon the mules by which it was drawn. Both animals imals sank down into the water, struggling in their death agonies, and the wagon of course became stationary. Several times subsequently my friends, headed by James, attempted, with the most desperate valor, to save me, but were each time repulsed by the foe, and found themselves obliged at last to retreat close into the position that they had selected for their final stand. 
               As had been suspected, the third party, that had disappeared over the wooded ridge, reappeared some distance down the valley, and were doubtless much surprised as they came dashing up on the other side of the stream, to find that we had changed our position. Our stratagem amounted not to much, however, for while the strongest party crossed the river to attack my friends, the other captured the wagon in which I was, and, dragging it ashore, after cutting the traces of the dead mules, commenced the work of overhauling its contents. 
               Of course, of these latter, I being the most prominent, was the first seized, and was violently jerked out upon the ground by a tall, powerful fellow, who instantly drew his tomahawk, and was about to finish my earthly career, when he was interrupted by a companion, who succeeded in persuading him to give me up to him. Regardless, however, of my own fate, I kept my gaze fixed anxiously upon the combatants on the other side. Volley succeeded volley; first from one and then the other of the contending parties, but those of the whites grew fewer and fewer, until at last only two men were left alive, who, seeing the utter hopelessness of their situation, surrendered to their foes. The latter, however, instead of showing them the mercy always due to a valiant but conquered foe, instantly tomahawked and scalped them. 
               As I beheld the fearful finale of the horrid butchery, I sank groaning to the earth. Of all the company, men and women, that had set forth in such high hope from St. Louis, I was the only living person left, and how long I might be spared I did not know. 
               Our wagons and their contents were a rich booty for the savages, who were so well pleased with their success, that they resolved to return without delay to their towns, some three or four days' journey to the southwest of the Big Blue. Before setting out, however, they dragged all the bodies of their victims to a deep ravine among the hills and threw them down into it, and, after holding a council concerning the wagons, resolved to burn two of them and load the remaining one with what plunder they could. The corpses of their own slain were all buried in a beautiful spot on the north bank of the river. The pains they thus took to conceal their diabolical work were induced from the fear they entertained, that some future white travellers, discovering the bodies of their murdered countrymen, might carry information thereof to the forts, and cause a detachment of soldiers to be sent out to avenge their deaths. And of the military power of the government all the Indians have a wholesome dread. 
                
               After they had completed, as far as they were able, the concealment of their butchery, the Pawnees set forward, as I have already said, for their village, three or four days' journey to the Southwest. My captor, or rather he to whom my captor had given me, forced me to mount a half wild horse and ride beside him. This, thanks to the fact that I was a good horsewoman, I accomplished without having my neck broken by the restiveness of the vicious animal I rode. 
               At the moment that I had seen the last of our party fall before their dusky murderers, I resolved to force my captors to take my life also; but, strange as it may seem, a hope at that very instant sprang up in my breast that I might some day or other again see my husband. I resolved, therefore, to live if possible, and ever afterward, even when my trials and tribulations thickened darkest about me, this hope, with its concomitant feelings, grew more and more intense. 
               On the evening of the third day we reached the Pawnee village, situated on a large stream of water, that I subsequently learned was an affluent of the Republican Fork of the Kansas river. The spot where the lodges were pitched was chosen with that taste for romantic scenery so inherent in the Indian breast. According to some custom or ceremony my captors did not enter the village that night, but remained out on a bluff on the river bank until morning; when all the village was aroused by runners to prepare for their reception. All being in readiness, the chief of the returned war party gave the required signal, and his braves moved forward to meet their friends who were awaiting them in a body. The scene that followed beggared all description, even the dogs joining in the noisy welcome. All were elated with the valuable prize that had been taken and the number of pale-face scalps that dangled at the belts of the victorious warriors. 
               I, being the only prisoner, soon became the centre of all observation, especially with the women, who universally bestowed on me nothing but the most malignant scowls. As I was, however, the captive of the second chief in the nation their demonstration reached no farther than this. To the lodge of this chieftain, whose euphonious name was The Buffalo Horn, I was soon taken, or, more properly speaking, driven by two of his wives into whose charge he had given me. These termagents, after shaking their fists in my face and brandishing knives over me, to intimidate me what my fate would be should I attempt to escape from my new quarters, left me and went out to join in the festivities that were proceeding. Up to this time my pride had forbidden the exhibition of any grief or fear on account of the perilous situation in which I was placed, but now that I found myself alone, and yet in the midst of relentless blood-thirsty enemies, I gave full vent to my feelings in a flood of tears. I compared my present condition with what it had been but a few years before, and oh! what cruel, terrible changes had been wrought upon me during the intervening years of sorrow. 
               While in the midst of these sad contemplations, I was suddenly startled by the report of a gun, which was followed by the screaming and crying of women and children, and a trampling of many feet. These sounds also came nearer and nearer to the lodge in which I was, and, a minute or so later, the body of a man was borne carefully into the lodge and deposited upon a rude pallet of skins. At a glance I recognised him as my captor, The Buffalo Horn. The unfortunate chief laid writhing in great agony for full a quarter of an hour before the doctors, or "Medicine Men," made their appearance. The latter had been thus detained in attiring themselves in their Medicine dresses, an indispensable operation to their success. The chieftain's wound, which I afterward learned was caused by the accidental discharge of his own piece, was directly through the right lung, and, of course, apparently fatal. Yet, nothing daunted, the Indian doctors set themselves to work, and, strange to say, succeeded for two or three days in keeping their patient up. But about this time a change for the worse took place and The Buffalo Horn began to sink with alarming rapidity. 
               At this juncture an idea struck me that perhaps his life might be saved in the same manner as was that of an American General, who, during a battle in the Mexican war, received a wound of the same nature.
                     Mrs. Morgan doubtless refers to the case of General James Shields, who, during an action, was struck by a copper ball, that entered his breast, and, passing straight through his body, came out at his back; so that "daylight shone through him." After being given up by all his own army surgeons, his life was preserved by the skill of a native physician.-ED.
                   To several of the chief's friends, who could understand English, I therefore, immediately communicated my thoughts, which were by them made known without delay to The Buffalo Horn himself. The latter ordered that I should be allowed to make the attempt. Until this moment what I had read concerning the manners, customs and disposition of the Indians never once crossed my mind, but it all occurred to me now, and I trembled at the thought of the danger into which my temerity and pity had led me. But to withdraw at this crisis was to seal my doom with certainty, for the superstitious and revengeful "Medicine Men," whose medicines had been pronounced "no good," would then, without doubt, accuse me of causing the death of the chief. So, without further delay, I began my hazardous task, I am free to confess I did so with much trepidation. 
               Among several articles which my enemies had left in my possession was a white, India silk hankerchief, which had been presented to me by a sea captain years before. After making all the preparations I deemed necessary, I took this handkerchief, and, wrapping it in a peculiar manner about a thin willow wand, from which the bark had been stripped, I insinuated it into the wound, and gently and gradually worked it completely through. Upon drawing it forth there came with it a mass of coagulated blood, and at this moment, to use a common expression, "daylight shone through the wounded man's body." Immediately after this I applied the preparations I 
                   
                     A tall powerful Indian instantly drew his tomahawk, and was about to finish my earthly career.-Page 21. 
                  
                   fornia. Some little time elapsed ere these preparations were completed, and then the band of warriors, headed by my patron, The Buffalo Horn, departed upon their marauding journey. I endeavored to obtain leave to accompany the expedition with the expectation of being enabled at some time to escape, but was steadily refused, and finally obliged to retire to my lodge. 
               This was a sad and bitter disappointment to me, and for a few days I was much depressed, but my hopes soon began to revive again; why, I could not tell, for my chances of getting away from my vigilant friends, if I may use that term, seemed to grow less every day. Yet hope I did, and with a strength and 
                     bouyancy
                     buoyancy
                   that astonished even myself. 
               During the last week in June there were but a few warriors left in the village, the rest being all absent in the expedition to which I have already referred. Among those that remained was a third chief of the tribe, who, however, was not an Indian, but a mulatto slave that had escaped from Missouri or Arkansas, and managed to make his way to the haunts of the savages. Among these latter he had, by reason of his prowess and daring, raised himself thus, and it is likely that, but for the event I am about to relate, he would have finally gained the position of first chief. This occurrence happened on the thirtieth day or rather night of June, and for awhile produced the wildest excitement in the village. 
               On the night in question, a messenger came to my lodge, and said that The Yellow Face-the fugitive's name among the Indians-was very sick, and wanted to see me immediately. Of late I had noticed The Yellow Face casting upon me leering glances and looks, that made me tremble, and now I felt a chill come over me as I heard his ominous message. But I feared to disobey, and, accordingly, with the utmost trepidation, I repaired to his lodge, where I found him reclining upon a rude but comfortable couch of skins and robes. For some moments he did not take any notice of my entrance, nor in fact until I spoke. This roused him, or more properly seemed to, for that he was acting a part I now felt fully convinced, and, as he fixed upon me his black, basilisk eyes, he said: 
               "The Yellow Face is very sick, and has sent for the White Medicine, because her medicine is good." 
               The look that accompanied these words only enhanced my fears, and I was unable to utter a single word in reply, so occupied was my mind with thoughts of how I might best escape from my dangerous companion. After a moment or so of silence, The Yellow Face rose and stepped toward me, saying, in his own natural voice and language: 
               "Don't be afeard, Missus, I'ze not agwine to hurt you. Yah! yah! I jes want you to come and be my wife; now won't you?" 
               With these words the ignorant and sensual brute sprang between me and the entrance of the lodge, and then, drawing a huge scalping-knife, grinned a mocking smile, as coming towards me again, he said, in low, chuckling tones: 
               "Look yere, Missus, you'd better not make no noise now, else you's a dead woman, dat's all!" 
               The diabolical intention of the villain was instantly revealed, or rather about to be consummated, for its revelation had been cotemporary with my entrance into the lodge. Yet what availed my puny strength in the grasp of such a giant, or what aid would my shrieks bring me? None whatever; for the Indians were too used to hearing the outcries of the women when beaten by the men. All this rushed through my mind, and guided my ensuing action, which was not a moment too soon, for, just as I sprang to the opposite side of the lodge, my foe was in the very act of clasping me in his foul embrace. 
               "God of mercy, save me!" I breathed in almost a whisper, as I bit my tongue and lips in an agony of fear and suspense, and kept my wildly staring eyes fixed upon the mulatto. 
               The latter, enraged that I had thus escaped him, scowled fiercely upon me, and, with a bitter oath, made a fresh attempt to grasp me. But again I managed to elude him, and bounded close to a frame of willow boughs on which were hung his shield and trappings, and against which leaned his spear and bow. With demon-like rage the monster, on finding himself thus foiled twice, leaped toward me, with an agility that precluded escape. 
               At this critical moment, however, and just as I gave myself up for lost, a thought struck me like an electric flash, and almost involuntarily I seized the keen-pointed spear that stood within my reach, and presented it at the breast of my antagonist. Both of our motions were so sudden and equally timed, that the following instant the spear head was plunged up to the pole directly in the heart of my lecherous foe, who, with a deep groan, sank dead at my feet. 
               Never, never shall I forget, nor shall I ever be able truly to describe, the feelings that seized me as I looked down upon the silent and now harmless giant, whose herculian arms could, a moment previous, have crushed my life out with a single effort. For an instant a pang of sorrow wrung my heart, and then followed that peculiar sensation, or self-conviction, of having shed the blood of a fellow being. As though fascinated, I continued to gaze down upon my dead foe, the handle of the avenging spear in my hand and the blade in his bosom. From this fearful reverie I was at last suddenly aroused by a wild scream, and, starting back, I beheld the dead man's favorite squaw rush into the hut and cast herself wildly down upon the corpse. 
               I waited no longer; the spell of horror was broken, and, uttering a stifled shriek, I bounded from the lodge, and, with flying steps gained my own, where I shut myself up, expecting every instant to be dragged forth and torn to pieces by the infuriated friends of the deceased. 
                
               I thought my hour had come when about ten minutes later a crowd commenced yellow and hooting and screaming outside my retreat. My eyes were closed, and, bowed to earth, I commended my soul to its maker. Minute followed minute, however, and hour succeeded hour, and yet, though the clamor seemed to increase, no one ventured to enter the lodge in which I sat trembling and despairing. Matters continued thus until the next morning, when, about two hours after sunrise, the savages who were collected around my wigwam, suddenly, and with a loud shouting, started away to some other point, and silence reigned profoundly for sometime after. Then came a scarcely audible murmur of human voices at a distance, which sound gradually increased in volume until I became convinced that the savages were returning. They had been, as I subsequently learned, summoned away to meet the war party of The Buffalo Horn, who had come back at that juncture from his marauding expedition in the plains. 
               I knew the revengeful dispositions of my wild companions, and I was moreover aware of the celebrity of the Chief whom, in defence of what was far dearer to me than life, I had, God knew, 
                     unintentially
                     unintentionally
                   slain. And, in this connection, I deem it only justice to the Indians, to say, that in their primitive state, far removed from the frontier, the crime of ravishing captive women, so common and hellish a vice among civilized nations, is entirely 
                        unkown
                        unknown
                     
                  . This statement may dissipate the romance many writers have imparted to their stories of the Indians and beautiful white captive maidens, but it is nevertheless a fact. An American savage will mercilessly butcher white women, but a wild and 
                     chivalous
                     chivalrous
                   honor deters him from ravishing or scalping them. 
               It must have been noon when at last my anxiety was somewhat relieved by a crier or runner of The Buffalo Horn, who announced to me that that chieftain wished to see me. The name and order of my friend seemed instantly to revive my spirit, and, strangely enough, I immediately began to hope. I was soon in the presence of The Buffalo Horn, who questioned me concerning the tragedy, in the manner rather of an old practitioner of law, than that of an untutored savage. I stated the whole matter simply and truthfully from beginning to end, confident that there was no other or better cause I could pursue. 
               How the doom that I had so fully expected would meet me, was ever turned aside, I never learned, but the following morning The Buffalo Horn told me that the friends of the deceased were satisfied, and that I was, therefore, in no further danger. Upon hearing this I fell upon my knees, and thanked my Heavenly Father that even far away in the wilderness, and in the midst of barbarous enemies, He had not forgotten me, but had thus far mercifully preserved me, and brought me safely through all dangers and tribulations. Oh, what a holy unction to the soul is the confidence of the humblest Christian, in the goodness and mercy of God. It is a well of pure water in the desert, and the shadow of a great rock in a dry and barren land. 
               My mind had no sooner became freed from the terrible suspense which had hung over me than I immediately began to devise new plans for my escape. It was a strange, wild idea that had taken possession of me, was this idea of escape, and it is certain that had I been fully informed of the fearful perils attending the attempt, I should never leave had the courage or temerity to put it in execution. But, at the time, I thought to myself that all I had to do was to steal away from the village, get safely out of sight of my foes, and then ride along until I fell in with some caravan or other crossing the plains to California. 
               My long wished and prayed for opportunity at length presented itself, and, one morning, just after sunrise, with a few necessary articles secured about my person, I mounted a splendid horse belonging to a noted warrior, and, giving him the whip, dashed away from the village with lightning speed. What emotions took possession of me as I swept over the swelling prairie, or through a woodland glade, it would be impossible for me even faintly to describe. I felt free, and yet it seemed as though an invisible arm was continually stretching forth to seize and drag me back into captivity. 
               The astonished groups of squaws and children through whom I rode, gazed at me in mute wonderment, as I flew onward, and never seemed to be aware of my intentions till I had cleared the last row of lodges, when at once comprehending all, they raised a terrible clamor, which, being borne on the wind to my cars, told me what I might now expect. 
               Desperation lent calmness, and, with a firm, steady hand, I guided my horse in the best directions, and kept the while a sharp look out in front, behind, and on either side of me for any outlying or pursuing parties of my dusky captors. Thank Heaven, none appeared, and I was beginning to congratulate myself that all was going well, when I dashed into a piece of woodland which, though open at first, immediately began to get thicker and more difficult. The long branches and limbs of the trees, as the wind imparted motion to them, seemed to reach down and snatch at me as I stooped close to my animal's neck to avoid or escape them. 
               Twenty minutes thus riding at speed through a forest is an extremely dangerous undertaking, for the horseman may in a twinkling be swept from the saddle, and left bleeding, perhaps killed, in his own track. I was fortunate, however, and with many hard brushes and several narrow misses of the leafy arms that continually grasped at me, I at length emerged into a stretch of open plain, and once more sat easily on my flying steed. 
               For several hours I rode forward, hoping every instant to see wagons, and white men who would, of course, rescue and protect me. But my eyes were strained in vain. I beheld no sign of human or even animal life in any direction. All was grand; all was beautiful; all was silent. Beneath me was the prairie with its lakes and rivers of fragrant, beautiful flowers, and its rich, green grass. Miles away behind me I could just catch glimpses of the forest that bordered the streams in that direction. Miles away before me I beheld the same undulating lakes and rivers of fragrant flowers and rich, green grass, while overhead was, what cannot be more aptly termed, the prairie sky. There is a peculiarity in this prairie sky, entirely cloudless as it often is, from the zenith to the horizon, and lit up by the full blaze of the summer sun. The bright, dark blue of the firmamental dome seems toned down somewhat by the whiteness, a barely perceptible vail or film which makes the beholder think of spirit, fills his mind involuntarily with ideas of the soul ideas of God. 
               Thus I mused even in the midst of danger, not knowing at what moment my pursuers might come in sight, and as I continued riding along at a slower pace in this grand, wild solitude, my thoughts gradually turned upon my husband. How long I remained in this abstracted mood I know not, but I was awakened at last from the delicious reverie by the sudden stopping of my horse. 
               In an instant I recovered myself, and scanned the horizon in all directions, but saw no foe. My steed, feeling himself to be his own master, had halted to rest himself, and drink of a little stream of water, that was here so narrow, that it was completely hidden beneath the long, rank grass of the plain through which it meandered. The action of the animal immediately reminded me of my own necessities, and, dismounting, I proceeded to prepare a meal. 
               Imagine my despair, however, on finding that the bundle in which I had wrapped up my scanty supply was gone. It must have been swept from my back, to which it had been secured or lashed by a strong pair of thongs, during my perilous ride through the forest some hours previous. At first I gave myself up for lost; for I knew I could obtain no food in the wilderness, and, as I had not yet met with the white travellers I had expected to fall in with, I instantly went to the other extreme, and decided that I never would. 
               However, after taking a deep draught from the welcome stream, and bathing my face and aching head in its cool waters, I felt much better, and praying to my Heavenly Father to guide me safely, I once more mounted my steed, and set forward at a venture. Just before sunset I espied at a distance a clump of bushes, and riding up to it, I tied my horse, and threw myself down upon the grass to stretch and rest my cramped and tired limbs. 
               As I did so, my eyes were attracted by the glitter of something in the grass at the edge of the clump. Upon reaching forth my hand to take it, I perceived it to be a small pocket compass. I did not, however, touch it, for at that instant, I discovered another fact, one which made my heart cease beating with horror. The compass rested among the bones of a human
                   
                  skeleton, which, having been scarcely covered with earth when buried, had become in the course of time thus partially exposed to view. It was now almost hidden, at least to a careless traveller, by the rank grass and flowers of the prairie. 
               Shuddering throughout my whole being, I started up, seized the bridle of my steed, and was just in the act of mounting, and speeding away from the fearful spot, when a thought restrained me. The compass was an article of the highest value in this vast wilderness; I had none. By its guidance I might reach friends; how, I could not tell; but the disturbed idea floated through my mind, like a flitting will-o'-the-wisp, that compasses led people in the right direction, guided them wherever they wished to go. This to me was rescue, it was life, it was safety; and, despite the chill of horror that crept over me at the thought of taking the coveted prize from amongst the mouldering bones of an unfortunate human being, who thus lay dreamlessly reposing in his shallow, prairie grave, I resolved to take it. 
               Quickly turning, therefore, I stepped back a pace or two, stooped down, and, with great drops of perspiration falling from my brow, I seized the compass, thrust it in the folds of the Indian blanket, which was wrapped about me, vaulted to the back of my horse, and dashed away like one guilty of a sacrilegious act. 
               The sun finally went down below the horizon, the twilight deepened into gloom, the stars, one after another, twinkling forth in the sky, night stole gradually over the prairie, and I was still a lost wanderer. Alone on the prairie! How much is contained in that little sentence. So terrible were the feelings that oppressed me, as I continued riding hither and thither, that I wished myself back a hundred times with my wild and savage captors, the Pawnees. I had tasted no food since daylight, and I began also to suffer extremely with thirst. But there was no help, no food, no water! It seemed as though I was doomed to die of starvation. 
               Exhausted and despairing, I at length dismounted from my nearly worn out animal, and threw myself down upon the grass and fragrant flowers to sleep. And sleep I did, soundly enough, until perhaps midnight, when I was suddenly aroused by a loud clap of thunder. In an instant my eyes were opened, but fear prevented me from rising, for immediately over my head, and glaring directly at me, were a pair of huge eyeballs, and a hot, heavy breath came upon my face. I gave myself up for lost; a wild beast had found me, and I was about to be devoured. Judge of my delighted surprise, however, when, a moment later the horrid monster gave a whinny of pleasure at finding himself successful in awakening me. It was the noble animal which had borne me so faithfully during the day. Affrighted by the approaching storm he had come thus to me for protection and companionship. I immediately arose and remained awake throughout the night, gently carressing him, and cowering behind him from the tempest which raged with fearful violence until daybreak. 
               Famishing, wet and despairing as I was, I felt ready, as I gazed through the falling rain over the prairie, to put an end to my miserable life. But once more came that same old thought-I might yet see my husband-and immediately all ideas of self-destruction were banished. But whither should I turn? I knew no path nor direction in which to travel. 
               In this dilemma I resolved to mount my dripping steed, and, leaving him to his own instinct, allow him to carry me wherever he chose. No sooner was my resolution made than it was put into execution, and, a few minutes later, the sagacious animal, with the bridle lying loosely upon his neck, was cantering toward the Northwest. By this time my hunger had become so intense, that I gnawed ravenously at the raw-hide whip I carried, hoping thus to partially allay the fierceness of my appetite. 
               One fact struck me particularly, which was, that my horse swerved neither to right or left, but kept steadily on in the direction he had first taken. His speed also seemed to increase, as he progressed. A thrill of joy passed through me, as, calling to mind all I had ever read concerning the sagacity of horses, I became confident that the one I rode was bearing me to friends and rescue. Though ready to fall to the earth with debility, the cheering thought 
                     bouyed
                     buoyed
                   me up, and I continually swept the horizon in front with anxious eyes, expecting every instant to catch sight of some friendly camp of whites. 
               Late in the afternoon it seemed to me as though the more noticeable spots, past which I had been riding for the last two hours, had a familiar look. Yet on I went, entirely unsuspecting, until, just as I rose over a ridge of the prairie, I came in full view of the identical Pawnee village from which I had, with so much peril, escaped. With my crooked, devious travelling I had only gone a distance away from it in a whole day and part of a night that my horse accomplished in half the time, and going at a much slower pace. My heart sank within me at the sight, and I felt ready now to curse the sagacity of my steed, or rather my own stupidity, in supposing that when I left him to his own instinct he would bear me to a white camp instead of back to his master's lodge. 
               However, a crisis was before me, and my desperate condition forced me to put a bold face upon the matter. So, without hesitation, I galloped straight into the village, through groups of my dusky captors, who, to my utter astonishment, received me with marks of joy and respect. My astonishment was immediately followed by pleasure, as, by this manifestation, it became evident to me that the savages looked upon my journey as "Medicine," or "a great mystery." When on the day previous I had ridden forth into the wilderness, it was thought my intention was to escape; but when the Indians saw me, as they supposed, thus voluntarily returning, it was "Medicine." 
               A terrible load was thus removed from off my mind, and, with a lightened heart, I dashed up to my own lodge, turned my horse loose, and entered the humble, and I must confess, at the moment, very welcome abode. 
               My escape had been so narrow that I could not summon nerve enough during the remainder of the summer to attempt another one, and, of course, it would have been sheer madness for me to brave the rigors of the wilderness in winter. So, Fortune, that fickle goddess, compelled me to remain a helpless captive until the following summer, when I once more made an effort to gain my freedom, or, more properly speaking, to reach some party of whites 
                     jurneying
                     journeying
                   to California. This getting to California, that I might rejoin my husband, was the only thought which had continual possession of my mind. As I sat alone in my rude wigwam, it was before me, as I slept at night it haunted me in dreams, and I could never banish it. It became a monomania. Often and often I almost repeated to myself those beautiful, beautiful lines: 
                      
                        "No! the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets, 
                        But as truly loves on to the close, 
                        As the sunflower turns on her God when he sets 
                        The same look which she turned when he rose." 
                     
                  
                
                
               
                   
                     The following instant the spear head was plunged up to the pole directly in the heart of my lecherous foe, who, with a deep groan, sank dead at my feet.-Page 28. 
                  
                
                
               Before making this last attempt for liberty, I took every precaution so as to insure my success, and, so far as effecting my release from my present captors was concerned, my fortune was all that I could have desired. But the fate of the fish, that leaped from the frying pan into the fire, was an exact parallel with my own, for; after travelling eastwardly for several days, I fell in with a small party of Kaskaskia Indians, who, though not exactly capturing me, as the term is usually accepted, for they were just then on friendly terms with the whites, would not suffer me to proceed in the direction I wished, but forced me to go along with them to their village. This was built, or rather pitched, upon the north bank of the Kansas river, one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles Southwest of Fort Leavenworth. 
               It was not long before I discovered that my fame, as "The Great White Medicine," had reached my new captors, and, on apparently assenting to remain always with the Kaskaskias, I was treated by them with as much respect, I may say reverence, as I had been by the Pawnees. Still, however, the village being in such close proximity to the border, the savages kept so strict a watch upon all my movements, that I found it utterly impossible to make any successful endeavor to escape. Several times indeed, I had every preparation made, but was each time baffled by some unexpected circumstance or other. On the last occasion it seemed as though Fate had sternly set her face against my ever regaining my freedom. 
               At the time of which I speak I had been a prisoner among the Kaskaskias two years. During the latter portion of these two years I had, as I fully believed, induced my captors to place the fullest confidence in my intentions of remaining with them during the rest of my life. It was not long after this that I determined to start for Fort Leavenworth, where, could I only succeed in reaching it, I would be safe. Since my first effort to escape from the Pawnees I had gained a vast amount of information which it was necessary that I should possess to make success certain, or at least to make it as nearly attainable as human events could be. How far I succeeded the 
                     sequal
                     sequel
                   will show. 
               On the day I finally resolved to start for the Fort, I arranged the most minute particulars of my future programme with the utmost precision. The weather favored my design. Rain had been falling heavily all day, which had the effect of keeping the Indians close in their lodges. To make assurance doubly sure, however, I deferred setting forth on my perilous journey until nightfall. My hopes increased as the day wore away without any abatement of the storm, and I felt certain of success as, at midnight, I stole stealthily to where the horses were coralled, selected the best one, mounted him, and rode softly, slowly away until I got at a safe distance from the town. Then, with a fervently breathed prayer to that God, who watches the mighty, solemn wilderness with equal care as he does the bustling metropolis, I dashed swiftly forward into the pitchy gloom. On I sped for Fort Leavenworth. 
               Soon after I had set out, it began to thunder heavily, and lighten frequently and very vividly. Indeed, so terrific did the scene at length become, that I was forcibly reminded by it of the plague sent upon the ancient Egyptians. From the zenith, the livid glare would burst forth, and leap instantly and in all directions to the horizon, while almost at the same moment, the bellowing thunder would come booming and rattling down from heaven, and go rumbling away over the prairie, only to be immediately followed by still more vivid flashes, and still louder thunder claps. 
                
               Oh! how strange did my situation at this moment seem, when I compared it to that which I had occupied in the earlier part of my life. I, who was then a delicate, puny girl, shrinking from airs too chilly, or sun-shine too warm; I, who then trembled at the slightest peril, was now dashing fearlessly through a fearful tempest, over a mighty prairie, with the blazing bolts of Heaven falling at my very feet, the wind howling in my ears, and torrents of rain drenching me through and through. Yet, I was not cast down, for my trust was in God, and I knew that if it was His holy will to bring me safely through, nothing could prevail against me. 
               With this comforting assurance, I pushed on during the dreary night, until just before I supposed the dawn to be at hand, when, coming to a stretch of timber, I resolved to halt and give my good steed, as well as myself, some rest. 
               As the sun came up, the storm began to break away, and, by the time the former had been shining two hours, the sky was, with the exception of here and there a fleecy bank, entirely clear of clouds. After making a frugal meal from some dried meat and parched corn, I again hastened forward, confident that my trail from the Indian village had been entirely obliterated by the heavy rain which had fallen. Consulting the precious compass, mentioned in a former page, and which I had preserved with religious care, I found that I was travelling in the proper direction. Full of joy, I became light of heart, and I fear light of head also, for I patted my steed lovingly on the neck, and addressed him in the most endearing terms, promising him another rest at a stream which I knew to be only a short distance ahead, from the line of trees within sight, growing on its margin. 
               Nearly a mile to the northward of where I was, I perceived a large band of buffaloes, that, with furious bellowings, was rushing headlong in the same direction as myself. This convinced me of two things, one of which at least was far from agreeable. The first was that these buffaloes, or correctly speaking, bisons, were crossing the scream beyond, and the second was that being so far out of their usual range, they must have been pursued by Indians. This latter fact rendered me uneasy, for I knew of no tribe in this section of country save the Kaskaskias, and should I unfortunately fall in with any party of the latter I feared that Fortune might not furnish me as good a plea as she had on the occasion of my flight from the Pawnee village. But there was no time to waste in calculations now. It was forward, forward with all speed to Fort Leavenworth, and forward did I go. 
               I reached the bank of the creek which I had seen, with the intention of resting awhile on this side, and then fording it, continue my journey till sunset. My feelings, however, may be imagined when, instead of a crystal, pearly stream, I found a muddy, rushing torrent, roaring angrily, and bearing fiercely along on its bosom, huge quantities of drift wood and trees, besides many an unfortunate bison. These last had been swept down by the tremendous force of the current, and were struggling frightfully, endeavoring to climb up on each other's backs, and hooking each other's eyes out. Many also had been dashed against the opposite shore, where they now stood panting, unable to climb the steep, slippery bank, and half submerged in mud and water. The scene was appalling, and I shrank back as did also my horse. 
               But at this instant, and even while I was debating what I should do, I chanced to cast my eyes back over the route in which I had come, and there, not far off, I beheld a sight still more appalling than the rushing river; a score of naked savages, mounted on half wild horses. As they noticed that I saw them, they set up a fearful yelling, and galloped faster than ever to overtake me. 
               Instantly my determination was fixed, and, with a wild and involuntary shriek, I dashed my noble, high-mettled steed straight into the foaming torrent. A moment, and then the angry waves were lashing about me, and causing my horse to snort with terror. Yet on he kept, guided by my hand, until we had neared the opposite shore, when all at once a fearful whoop resounded from the bank behind, followed instantly by a ringing of rifles, and a whistling of bullets around us. But neither of us, strange to say, was struck, although an unfortunate bison beside us sank dead at the fire. 
               We were close to the other bank, which, as I have said, was lined for some distance down with half exhausted bisons, which, however, as they saw us approaching, prepared to give us battle, fearful that we were going to push them from their foothold. 
               "Great God!" I gasped, as I saw this new danger, "even the wild beasts are against me!" 
               The words had scarcely left my lips before the noble steed, that had carried me so faithfully, was forced directly against the horns of a huge bull, who, with a bellow of rage, and a last effort at self-preservation, gored him, and actually tossed him, with me still on his back, several feet into the air. All I remember after that was pitching upward and forward, striking heavily on the bank, and scrambling to a level spot out of danger of rolling back into the river. When consciousness returned I found myself lying at the foot of a tree, and my hands tied securely behind me with a long thong, which in turn was fastened around the trunk of a tree. 
               I saw in a moment that they were a roving band of Indians, who having recognized and captured me, intended to carry me back to their village, from which I had escaped. 
               I will not dwell upon the rough treatment I received at the hands of these savages, who, had I been a common prisoner, instead of "The Great Medicine," would have soon tomahawked me; neither is it necessary that I should minutely record the events of my subsequent life among them. 
               Suffice it to say, that in the latter part of "1861" an agent from Albert Pike, a man well known among the Indians, arrived at the village, and held several conferences with the principal men of the tribe, the result of which was, that nearly all the warriors prepared themselves to follow their chief to battle. Obtaining an interview with this man, I related my story to him, and begged of him to intercede with my captors. This he promised to do, expressing at the same time great commiseration with me in my misfortunes. From him I learned for the first time that a bloody war was being waged between the North and South. I could not bring myself to believe it, and yet the preparations going forward indicated something unusual. All I could do was to wait and see how matters would turn out. 
               Before the agent left, it was agreed between him and the Indians, that I should be allowed to accompany them until reaching Arkansas, when I should be set free. I named Fort Leavenworth to him, but he peremptorily refused to allow me to go thither, why I did not realize at the time, but it has since become clear to me. I was also too thankful for the privilege already granted, to complain of any seeming inconvenience. 
               From that time forward I looked anxiously every day for the departure of the warriors, who were to march at a given signal into Arkansas, to join an Indian army there under the command of General Pike. This signal was not given until the beginning of February. There was, however, no delay after that, and accordingly we soon found ourselves in Pike's camp, where were already congregated a large number of Indians-some four or five thou-and-gathered from many different tribes along the frontiers. 
               It was during my stay in the rebel camp, that I fully learned the nature of the contest that was going on, from a sick Union prisoner, whom I tended. 
               I could see that it was not intended that I should escape, as a guard was placed at the opening of my tent, both night and day. 
               I resolved to escape, if possible, at the first opportunity. I was informed that a battle was about to take place between the Union and a portion of the Southern army. At last the time for action came. It was the night before the battle. Who could say, what the next day would bring forth? 
               As I lay in the tent assigned me by the General, I thought I heard a sound, as if some one was talking, yes, I was not mistaken; it was two guards, one of whom was placed there to guard me, the other had come to relieve the first, I could hear every word they said. 
               "You know the captain said we must watch her well, cause you know she might give us the slip," said one of the men. 
               "Yes, yes," said the other, "but we can just slip over to Jim Carsons, and get a little of his whiskey, the "gal's" sound asleep 'fore this." 
               "Don't talk so loud," said the first, "she might wake up and hear you." 
               "Well, here goes," said the second. 
               I then heard their footsteps, as they silently left my tent. 
               As I lay thus the thought entered my mind, that escape was possible. I might try; if they did catch me, they would only bring me back, and guard me more securely. Why not try it? My mind was made up instantly. 
               I quietly arose and softly wended my way to the opening in the tent. I felt the fresh air as it was gently wafted upon my fevered cheeks and brow. "Oh for liberty once again!" I looked upon both sides of me, all was as silent as the grave. I advanced a few steps, and then stopped. I trembled in every limb. I could not move. I stood there like a marble statue. I stood thus for a few moments before I could regain my composure enough to go forward. I had taken but a few steps, when I heard the guards returning. I crouched behind some bushes which grew near the place where I then stood. Having reached the tent, one of them looked in, saying at the same time, "he supposed the 'gal' was all right." 
               "Never fear for that," said the other. 
               They then separated, one going towards his own tent, and the other having stationed himself in front of mine. 
               I dared hardly breathe, the guard lay within eight feet of where I was. None can describe my feelings on that occasion. 
               The guard would frequently drink of whiskey, which he had in his canteen. This frequent pulling at the canteen (as the soldiers say) soon made him drunk. 
               As soon as I was sure that he was too drunk to create any alarm, I quickly arose from my painful position, and turned in the direction of the Union encampment, which I reached two hours before sunrise. 
               I was taken before the General in command, to whom I told a portion of my story. After he had heard it, he informed me that I was very welcome, as I brought him news of the Confederates, and that I might be of some use on the morrow. 
                
               I was shown a tent in which to sleep. I laid down, and was soon fast asleep. I awoke in the morning to hear the firing of cannon, and the cries of the wounded. 
               The battle had now began in earnest; it lasted three days. On the second, as I was standing among the wounded in the rear, I beheld a Confederate, who had apparently been leading his company, running and fighting his way through the companies in advance of him, reached the Union army, his clothing perfectly riddled by bullets, having also (as I learned afterwards) received several serious wounds. 
               I saw them lift this man off of the ground on which he had fallen, and bring him towards the sick and wounded. Yes, even towards the tent near which I then stood. 
               "Who is he?" I exclaimed. 
               "We don't know, marm," said one of the men who had brought him. "We heard the Rebs say that he was a traitor." 
               "Traitor! who calls me a traitor?" exclaimed the wounded man. No one answering, he said "No, thank God! The man who fights for that glorious ensign of American Independence, is no traitor. I repeat it, is no traitor." 
               The exertion had been too much for him; he fainted in the arms of a soldier, who was holding him. 
               As he was speaking, it seemed to me that I had seen that man before. Where had I seen that face? It seemed strangely familiar to me, but I could not place it. 
               They laid him on the couch that I had occupied before he came. As they did so, one of the soldiers turning to me said, "Madame, we leave this wounded, perhaps dying, man in your charge." 
               They then left me, perhaps never to return again. I watched by the side of this wounded soldier's bed for five long weary hours. At last he opened his eyes and gazed upon me in a wild manner. He had a burning fever; he talked of fighting Indians and digging for gold. At last his eyes were closed; he slept, and in his dream I heard him talk of a wife whom he had not seen for years. 
               One day as I watched, as usual by his bedside, I heard him utter the name of Gertrude; I turned toward him, and his lips again uttered the name of Gertrude. What could this mean? I uttered my thoughts aloud, which awoke him, he looked at me in that same strange manner. 
               "Those eyes! Where had I seen them before? They were my husband's. Thank God! I knew him now." 
               I told my story to the Doctor, who informed me, that if I valued the life of my husband, I must keep out of the tent, as any sudden excitement would kill him. 
               Thus for two weeks I waited. Oh, how long they seemed; it was almost as if two years instead of weeks had passed. 
               At last I was permitted to see him, and converse with him. 
               I will pass over the joy of both, after having been separated so long. After I had told my story, (which the reader already knows,) he related his, which I will give in his own words. He began as follows: 
               "After I left Chouteau's Station, I fell in with some hunters, and learning that they were going in the same direction as I, we joined company. 
               "I will pass over the many dangers encountered, and hardships endured by us, (as it would fill a whole volume;) suffice it to say that we reached the gold regions; and after having lived there nearly six years, (not having heard from you all this time, except that you had been-taken captive, I had long since mourned you as dead,) I started for home, (having amassed a fair fortune.) I had come about half the distance, between Chouteau's Station and the Missouri river, when I was captured by a band of Indians. I supposed immediately, that my captors were a roving band of Kaskaskias, whom I had thus accidentally fallen in with, and who, having captured me, intended to carry me to their village. The event proved the correctness of the supposition. 
               "I need not dwell upon the rough usage I met with at the hands of the savages. Suffice it to say, that in a few days we reached the village. 
               "The day arrived for me to be burned at the stake, but an All-seeing Providence prevented it. A terrible storm arose, carrying off every thing in its course. The stake to which I was to have been burned was uprooted and carried away by the wind; the lightning flashed, the thunder roared, and the rain came down in torrents. The storm lasted three hours. 
               "The Indians, being of a very superstitious nature, thought that it was an interposition of their Great Spirit, or God, and from that time I was treated in the best possible manner, for white man to be treated by the uncivilized Indians. They looked upon me as a wonderful personage, though, at the same time, I was guarded in the strictest manner. 
               "I lived among these savages for almost five years. I joined in their sports until I became quite an adept. One day, as I with several others was hunting near the village, a runner came in, out of breath, from whom we learned (I had learned to speak the Indian tongue) that a war had broken out between the North and South, and that the tribe to which they belonged was offered very enticing inducements to join the Southerners. 
               "I will pass over the excitement which prevailed among those belonging to the tribe; it having been decided that they should join the Confederates, I asked the privilege of going with them, which was granted. 
               "In due time we arrived at the confederate encampment, where I was selected as a lieutenant of an infantry company. With seeming gladness I accepted the commission, resolving at the same time never to fight against the Old Flag. 
               "During the first day's engagement, I was too sick to join my company, but on the second, the captain being killed in the first engagement the command, of course, devolved upon me-therefore I was obliged to comply. 
               "As I was apparently leading my company, I turned and fought my way to the Union Army, where I am, 'thank God,' this day." 
               I will pass over the events which occurred during our stay in the Union Army. Suffice it to say, that after procuring a pass for New York, we reached that city in due time. 
               And now that my narrative is finished, dear reader, I would say to you, may you never encounter the dangers or endure the hardships of Gertrude Morgan. 
               THE END. 
             
         
       
       
          
             
            
                
                  Yet on I went, entirely unsuspecting, until just as I rose over a ridge of the prairie, I came in full view of the identical Indian village, from which I had, with so much peril, escaped!-Page 34.
