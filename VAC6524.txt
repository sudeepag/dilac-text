I WONDER if you children, living safely in your pleasant homes, with books and toys enough each one of you to fill almost a shop, going to school in nice, comforta- ble school-rooms, with plenty of maps, and globes, and books, playing in the streets and in the woods, with nothing to fear-I wonder if you can at all realize the feelings of the boys and girls who lived in New England a little more than r   a hundred years ago.  I. suppose not. And yet they were very much such boys and girls as you are, though, to be sure, not so delicately reared. They were sometimes hungry and cold, but they had rJ     10  LEGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE. learned to endure, and hunger and cold were nothing to the terrible fear of In- dians. They could not go to bed at night and be sure they would not be awakened by the savage war whoop. A boy could not go to drive the cows into the pasture, a girl could not go into the woods for ber- ries or May-flowers, or young winter- green leaves, and be sure of not being seized and carried away as captive by an Indian, lurking, for the purpose,' behind a tree or wall. While the people worshiped on the Sab- bath, each man having brought his gun, one was set to keep watch without. A smoke arising from the unbroken woods on the mountain; the report of a gun; even the shaking of an autumn- colored leaf, mistaken by some bird-nest- ing boy for the red feather worn by a savage, would be sufficient to excite the fear that the Indians had come* down upon the settlements, and were hiding away by day to come out at night, burn- ing their dwellings and murdering or taking captive all their families.   "EGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE.  1 For defense against these sudden inva sions there were erected along the Coo necticut River, at intervals of a few mile! forts or garrison-houses, and to these, o the least alarm, the women and childre were carried; while the men cultivated th ground, with their guns near at han( during the day, and at night followe their families to the garrison-house.

It was on. a September evening. The garrison-house, which was standing where the pleasant village of Northfield is now located, about two or three miles north of the battle-ground, was filled with men women, and children, in a state of terri- ble suspense and dread. An immense body of Indians had come into the region, filling all the woods about. They had murdered nine or ten persons, and the re- maining inhabitants of the settlement had fled to the garrison-house. Their provi- sions were falling short, but on the night of my story they were expecting a body of men, who were coming from Hadley to their defense, bringing with them a fresh supply of food. But they were also every minute expecting an attack on the garrison-house. Fancy yourself a moment, if you can, within this garrison-house.

" LEGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE. While they listened in the wildest ter- ror, praying with strong crying unto God, who pitieth those who fear him, even as a father pitieth his children, it seemed to them that the firing was gradually slack- ening; then only an occasional gun was heard. At length the noise of battle ceased altogether, when suddenly there was a single report, which was (said the old men who used to tell the story) "as loud as a eId-piece." As quick as light- ning it was answered by a countless num- ber of guns. Soon after a shout was heard in the meadow below the fort, a call in the darkness for aid. Some per- sons went out and returned with a soldier, around whom  the breathless company gathered eagerly. He was one of thirty-six men who had come up, under the command of Captain Beers, for the assistance of the Northfield settlement, The Indians, as it was sup- posed, were apprised of their approach and lay in ambush for them. Of the hor- rors of the terrible fight he " only escaped alone to tell." 'The men of his company V;   "EGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE.  15 were. obliged in the darkness to shoot at random, while the Indians, sheltered be: hind the trees, aimed at the flash of their guns with certain and deadly effect, Captain Beers fought most bravely, bul he was slain; and then the men, flying ir every direction, were swept away like mown grass, until he found himself, as he supposed, the only survivor. He startec to run for the fort, and then came upor another man, who was in the act of re loading his heavy gun. He said to him "You had better run: we are the onl] men alive." "I'll give them one more shot first,' replied the excited soldier, and' he pourec an enormous quantity of powder and balls into his gun and fired it. It caused i report like a cannon. A multitude ol guns pointed at the flash gave earnest answer. No doubt the rash soldier hac fallen. Again a shout was heard from  th( meadow. How it thrilled through everj bosom!

His story was this: Unharmed by 'the bullets that flew around him, he ran, a troop of savages following closely. Suddenly the ground gave way under his feet, and he found himself lying, entirely covered with leaves, at the bottom of a pit. His pursuers seemed greatly disconcerted by his dis- appearance, and he heard them, in their low, peculiar tones, ascribing it to the agency of "Chepian," their evil spirit. they moved away, no one among them happening to step on the deceitful bridge of dead leaves, and after a few minutes of silence he crawled upward and listened. Hearing nothing he ventured quite out, and leaving his gun, on account of its weight, ran to the fort. All night long the company in the fort waited and watched for the dreaded on- set; but for some reason, never known to them, the Indians did not attack them. The pitiful Father spared them this. The records of the time tell us there were sixteen who escaped. Scattered   I.'   LEGEND OF BEEIS'S BATTLE.  17 along the forest road, the most of them fled southward. According to the old legend only two reached the garrison- house. The next morning the soldiers went down. for the gun left in the pit, but it was notg there, and all the leaves were found carefully removed from the hollow, which has ever since borne the name of "Soldier's Hole." Two days after Major Treat came up, with one hundred men, to carry away the garrison, and they found along the high- way the heads of the dead soldiers erected insultingly on poles. It was a terrible struggle. These fertile meadows and teeming forests, this beauti- ful river, filled with shad and noisy with wild ducks, had been usurped by a pallid race, before whom the grand old trees of the hunting-grounds were melting away. The Indians were mad with jealousy; but by the settlers they were regarded rather as fiends than as human beings, and the ?!  hate between the races grew fiercer and more unquenchable as blood on both i  [      18   LEGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE. sides was poured out without mercy or pity. Almost two hundred years have passed since the sickening horrors of that evening in September; and now, among the de- lightful towns in   Massachusetts, along the Connecticut River, there 'are few more  lovely  than  Northfield, with  its long, rural street and picture-like meadows. Three  miles below   stretch, for two miles, 'The Farms," thickly dotted with thrifty farm-houses, about which are pleas- ant gardens and orchards, corn and wheat fields, sloping  down  toward  the river. Behind rises the woody mountain. The mill-wheel dashes the mountain stream To a thousand gems of spray; Between the rows of the apple-trees The frolicsome children play, As the golden light of the autumn bright Lies over the hills to-day. Here the deer once led her spotted fawn To the tender birch-leaf bud: Here the panther screamed with a human voice, And the gaunt wolf howled for blood; Here the lightning flash and the thunder crash Of battle went through the wood.   "EGEND OF BEERS'S BATTLE.      19 Here the horrible war-cry rang at night, And the pale-faced soldieri fied, And strong men groaned in a mortal pain As the ground grew wet and red; And the morning gray of an autumn day Looked out on the mangled dead.

A LITTLE above where the waters of the Deerfield lose themselves in the Con- necticut, on their way to the ocean, is the village of Greenfield. It is a prosperous village of pleasant homes and busy shops, of streets shaded by graceful elms and thrifty maples, and bordered with green yards and gay flower-gardens, bearing no resemblance to the group of roughly-built houses standing here at the time of the French and Indian War. Lieutenant Severance, who lived in what is now the town of Bernardston, was then stationed here with a company of soldiers. One afternoon he came back from some excursion, and asked who would take his horse to the pasture. A   young soldier, named Corss, offered to go, and as the lieutenant threw him the bri- dle he said, 'You must take my gun; perhaps you'll need it." The beautiful days of early summer had come, and 'had brought out myriads of leaves on every tree, and bush, and swing- ing vine, and with summer and the leaves the Indians always came. Through the cold, naked winters the settlers had not much fear of them; but at this season they skulked in companies from Canada, after captives; and though there had none been seen as yet, there was no safety  abroad, for a gun might be pointing at the unconscious traveler from any harm- less thicket or tree by the wayside. No wonder that people regarded the trees as allies of the sly savages, and re- joiced at the fall of them; and I am not sure but the old prejudice has been trans- mitted somewhat to those of the present generation, who cut down a beautiful tree, if it chance to be a little in the way, with as little consideration and regret as though it were a nettle; never caring that the   22   CORSS AND THE INDIANS. sun and rain had been perhaps a century forming the tree so thoughtlessly de- stroyed. But if it had not been for the shelter they gave to Indians trees were so plentiful nobody grudged to see one fall, and nobody thought of planting one, ex- cepting for fruit. The way to the pasture led along a bridle-path, that has grown to be Main- street since, down the hill and across the brooki off toward where Nash's fill is now. How the young rider would have stared if anybody had told him that some day the cars would fly, "with a rush, and a roar, and a rattle," and nd horse to draw them, on a road that should pass under the ground where he was going! That wires would be fastened a little higher than his head, telling people what was happening a hundred miles away; and that, in the wonderful future, lamps would be lighted along that very path without wick or oil, burning nothing that could be seen, yet giving as much light as a blazing pitch-pine knot! Well might he wonder; wiser heads would have been   I B i  I c     No. 783.  Corss's narrow Escape.   CORSS AND THE INDIANS.  25 puzzled, for these things had not been thought of then. Suddenly the horse started, snuffed, and shied, refusing to go forward. Corss looked about him, but saw nothing un- usual. The boughs waved gently in the soft summer air, the squirrels. and wood- birds answered each other from the tree tops with no sign of danger. It was not fashionable to be easily frightened in those days, so he drove the horse by, and put him safely in the pasture. But cau- tion was fashionable, and as the people hadlearned to be always on the look out for Indians, Corss avoided the path on his return, and coming carefully behind a  fence, a little to the side the horse shied from, he saw, sure enough, an. Indian crouching behind a stump, looking out along the road, with his gun aimed that way. The quick scent of the horse had perceived the strong and peculiar odor which was always about these wild men, and so had savl the life of the rider.      ( Corss raised the lieutenant's gun, fired,     26   CORSS AND THE INDIANS. and ran. On his way to the settlement he met the people, who had heard the report and supposed he was killed, run- ning with their guns. They went to the stump and found there only a pool of blood and a few bullets. For a short distance they tracked the blood on the ground, and then all trace of it disappear- ed, and there was no more seen or heard of the Indians at that time. Afterward a returned captive from, Canada told the rest of the story. An Indian boy having been killed, his father, wished to adopt a white boy, about the same age, in his place, according to. the custom of his tribe, and a scouting party came down the Connecticut Valley look- ing for one. COn a certain day a youth came riding a horse toward a pasture. One of the Indians seeing him hid him- self, waiting till he came back on foot, as he expected he would do; but the "pale- face," returning another way, killed him. Then his compa ions carried the dead body to Green Rive, and buried it under some flood-trash, so much disheartened by   CfRSS AND THE INDIANS.  2T this unexpected turn of fortune and the frown of the Great Spirit that they went directly back to Canada, without trying to take any captives. At another time Corss had a still nar- rower escape. He was hoeing in a field, with his gun leaning against a tree. He had gone through a corn-row, and turning to come back, saw a large Indian right between him and his gun. He raised his hoe and ran toward him. The Indian fired, but missed aim, which is much less sure when the enemy is running toward than when running from one, as very likely you have already heard, boys, in these war times. Then, quick as thought, Corss darted forward and gouged both the eyes of the Indian with his thumbs, starting them from the sockets. The wounded man ran, blinded, and screaming with pain, going, as it happened, directly to the settlement, and the people there concluded he would be a good subject to experiment upon. So they carefully put back his eyes in place, and nursed him till they were     28   CORSS AND THE INDIAlS. healed, and then he could see again as well as ever. This seems to me like a marvelous story; but it came, with many other traditions, from my grandmother, and Corss was a relative of hers, so I intend to believe it. I often wonder whether the Indian harbored revenge for the loss of his eyes, or was grateful for their restora- tion.     PA UGUS. 'Twas Paugus led the Pequot tribe; As runs the fox would Paugus run, As hoiwls the wild wolf would he howl; A large bear skin had Paugus on. OLD BALLAD. "ONG before boys thought of firing off crackers and sending up rockets on the Fourth of July any more than they did on the fourth of January, a little girl named Anna Craig lived in Massachu- setts, near where the town of Groton now stands. I suppose she looked and acted much as children do now-a-days, and was as fond of play as any of you. I dare say, Charley, you would have found her just as pleasant to play hide and seek with as your little blue-eyed sister is. But the boys who played with Anna, even those of them who lived to be white-haired old men, have been under the grass for many     30      PAUGUS. a year, with an ancient-looking, moss- grown stone above their heads; for Anna lived away back in the bloody time of the Indian wars, when men slept with loaded guns by their beds, and carried loaded guns even to the house of God. Sometimes there would be no hostilities for a while, and then the Indians visited the white men's houses, bringing curiously made baskets and birch brooms, to trade for food. After one of these peaceful seasons, when, as far as the English knew, nothing had gone wrong, the Indians all quietly disappeared frora the settlement. Their absence was not noticed for a few days; but it was with a sudden thrill of terror that the people said to each other presently: "The Indians have gone away!" They had learned by hard experience that a sudden absence was a sure sign the savages had taken offense at something, and were off preparing for war. -Then they put the women and children into the largest house, which was built of logs;   PAUGUS.      31 hardly so nice a place to live in as people build now for their cows and horses. They kept the cattle in the inclosure about it, and reaped the half-ripe grain to live upon, and to keep it from being destroyed by the savages. And now whenever and wherever red and white men met each other there was fighting, and the fair earth, spotted over with daisies and violets, grew ghastly un- der its burden of the wounded and dying. At last there was a great. battle by the side of'a pond in Maine. It happened that Paugus, the Indian chief, and his men were on the bank above the English, who being below among the trees and bushes which bordered the water, had the best of it.      ' Occasionally an' English head would peer up, and an English eye would take deadly aim at some skulking Indian, who hardly saw the gun that killed him; then the head would disappear down the bank among the bushes again. By and by a tall, strong man cautiously showed the top of his head, which was     32      PAUGUS. seen by Paugus, the chief, who was as tall and strong as he. Paugus called to him: "Chamberlain, come and fight me." Paugus had often warmed himself by Chamberlain's fire, at his home away in Groton; he had eaten at his table, and played with his children. They had traded with each other and slept under the same roof; but if, during a battle, one man challenged another to single combat, it was considered very cowardly to refuse, though they were ever so friend- ly in time of peace. Besides, the blood of the men was hot with rage and hatred, and their arms were nerved by the mad excitement of the fight and the sight of the bodies of their fallen friends. So Chamberlain drew himself up the bank and stood on level ground, facing Paugus. The aim of both was so sure it was only a question of time. The man who could pull a trigger the quickest would doubtless kill the other. The fighters about them stopped a little to watch the combat which was so evenly   PAUGUS.      33 balanced. In their haste they did not take a careful aim, and both missed fire; but it was only the work of an instant to put in a fresh charge. Holding an open powder-horn over the muzzle of the gull until there had been time to count a cer- tain number-varying with the size of the charge to be used--and dropping another bullet from the mouth, where it was the fashion to carry a few extra ones, the gun was struck on the ground, which caused it to cock itself, and was ready for use. But this time it happened that Paugus's bullet stuck in the gun-barrel, and he was obliged to draw the ramrod and ram it down. Quick of motion as a beast of prey, he took so speedy an aim that after all there was but one report-a length- ened one-but Chamberlain's gun began it. The ball passed through the heart of Paugus, and gave a sudden upward aim to his gun, with the trigger already pulled, so that the ball just grazed Chamberlain's head, while the Indian, with a hideous yell, fell backward and died.     34      PAUGUS. "A little more and he would have killed you," said his comrades. "A little more and he wouldn't have hit me at all," said Chamberlain. Then the battle raged again fierce and pitiless, till the Indians were forced to retreat. Time passed on, and the old feud was forgotten. Men lived in their own homes again, and planted their fields, and again the Indians were friendly. But there was one breast where the flames of hatred and revenge burned fiercer for the long delay. Paugus had a son as stout and huge as he was, and according to the In- dian custom he must revenge the death of his father. One day somebody in Groton had "a raising." Perhaps you have never heard of these old-time festivals, which were so fashionable when trees were many and men were few. When a building was ' put up" it used to be customary to frame it on the ground, and then, with the help of all the men and boys far and near, it was raised to its place on the   PAUGUS.      35 foundations. You may be certain that all kinds of eating. and drinking were plenty, for people thought quite as much of good cheer in the old times as they do now. At/this raising in Groton, which hap- pened more than a century ago, there was an Indian about among the people who was a stranger to them all. In the course of the afternoon he asked some one if a man' named Chamberlain lived near: "And a very good man he is too," he added. Presently, after the toddy had been passed freely about, and the stranger had drank again and again, his caution was forgotten, according to the old proverb, "When wine goes in wit goes out," and he said boldly that he was Paugus's son, and had come to kill Chamberlain. When his neighbors told him of it, and entreated him to keep out of the way, Chamberlain only laughed with contempt; but he barred the rough door of his log- house as: strongly as possible, and put a double charge in the gun, which stood     36      PAUGUS. within reach of his arm by the bedside. I imagine he did not sleep so soundly but a little noise awoke him, fearless as he was. Very early the next morning, before it was quite light, he heard a pig grunting about his house. Then he crept cautiously to the door with his gun, and looking through the cracks, which were for once very convenient, he saw presently a head peep up from behind a stump, and he perceived very plainly that the grunting came from that head. In an instanit he leveled his gun and fired. The two bul- lets went through the door, and through the head which was peering above the stump. Then the grunting ceased; there was a souh d of a human body falling heavily tg the ground; and this was the end of the Indian's revenge. When his neighbors asked Mr. Cham- berlain what had become of Paugus's son, he said there was a hog came grunt- ing around his house, and if they wanted to see it they might go and look in the pond.   PAUGUS.      37 Little Anna Craig used to go to this very house from which Chamberlain shot the Indian, to play with the children there; and she often put her fingers through the bullet holes, which always remained in the door. When Anna had grown to be an old lady with wrinkles and white hair, she was my grandfather's grandmother, and she told this story of Paugus to her grand- son, who, long after she was dead, told it to my father. He, in his turn, told it to me, and now I have told it to you. Legends of New England. 3     "EGEND OF LANCASTER. Our band is few, but true and tried; Our leader frank and bold.-BRYANT. AN old gentleman whom I often saw when I was a child, and whose home was in Warwick, Massachusetts, used to tell to my father a story, which his grandfa- ther told him, of the early days of Lancas- ter, in the same state. It is not a very pleasurable story per- haps, but it is well for you to know what those good brave men endured who came to New England, not for wealth or power or love of conquest, but for liberty to worship God in the way they believed most acceptable to him. They no doubt erred many times in their treatment of the Indians, but it was through ignorance rather than willfulness; for they were men :of sublime purpose   "EGEND OF LANCASTER.   39 and noble deeds, and they left the pleas- ant homes, the flowering hedgerows and gardens of merry England and came into what seemed to them a frightful, howling wilderness, that they might not have to assent to what they considered falsehood. The annals of those early days in jew England history remind one of the times of the leader Joshua, when "the Lord was with Judah and he possessed the mountain." Lancaster, Massachusetts, is a pleasant flourishing town, situated on the Nashua River, in Worcester County. It was set- tled in 1643. In 1675 there were more than fifty families in this town, and until the breaking out of King Philip's War they lived in great harmony with the In- dians, mutual acts of kindness passing continually between them. But King Philip bore at heart a sore- ness and bitterness toward the English because of the death of his brother, which he supposed had been occasioned by them. Being strongly suspected (though proba- bly unjustly) of treachery to the white     40   LEGEND OF LANCASTER. men, Alexander, the brother of Philip, had been severely threatened and treated with indignity, and his haughty spirit was irritated to that degree that he fell into a fever, of which he died. Besides, Philip chafed at the frequent requests for selling more and more land. He saw the splendid hunting-grounds and beautiful waters, the inheritance of his fathers, sold away from his tribes with somewhat of the feeling with which an heir of ancient estates in England would regard domain of park and moor and castle passing from the old:family name. Injury and insult, fancied and real, accumulated, avalanche-like, until King Philip resolved to exterminate these peo- ple from the land; and to this end he in stigated the various tribes of New En. gland to make war upon them. One morning in February, in the year 1676, just as the rising sun was crimson- ing the snowy hills, fifteen hundred In- dians burst with their terrible war-cry up- on the peaceful town of Lancaster. They ran from house to house, setting many of   "EGEND OF LANCASTER.   41 them on fire, murdering twelve of the in- habitants, and taking captive the remain- der, except one, who escaped. I do not know how long it was after this first attack that the events of my le- gend took place, but the town had again become inhabited, and the grandfather of Mr. Stevens, who used to tell the story, was commander of a company of seven men who were stationed there in the gar- rison-house, or blo ck-house as it was some- times called. This was a kind of fort made of logs "hewn foursquare," and locked together at the ends. This fort was surrounded by a fence of logs, built breast high. Mr. Stevens's grandfather was a black- smith, and he had a forge in the fort at which he used to work. One day he bus- ied himself in making a long heavy knife, sharpening it to a perfect edge. "What are you making that for?" asked the men. "You will see presently, I've no doubt," was the reply of their blacksmith-chief. Early one morning soon after, there     42   LEGEND OF LANCASTER. were seen, ' grimly marching " out of the forest, a large company of the dusky war- riors. They went into the barnyard hard by the fort, and while some fell to slaugh- tering the cattle, others of their number built large fires. Then they commenced to cut off fresh steaks and to roast them by the fires. They ate with boisterous merriment, and shouted out to the gar- rison the insulting threat, "After break- fast we pay you visit." Having satisfied themselves with eating, the savages stepped out one after another in what was termed by the white men ' Indian file ;' then the whole number surrounded the breastwork of the fort at a little distance from it. The seven men were waiting for them with various weap- ons, but in the hand of the commander was the long sharp knife. The Indians, rushing forward all at the same time, leaped against the breastwork with intent to vault over, but were gal- lantly met by the eight soldiers within, the blacksmith cutting off the heads of several, so says the legend, with fierce,   I t 1 i 4 o i     Ai             F "'4m ' ' -' - - X  ."

They retreated to a rye-field not far off, in which they concealed themselves; then one of them called out insultingly to the soldiers to surrender the fort. "Don't see anybody to surrender to," retorted the commander. An Indian, leaping in bravado above the rye to a great height, called out, "Here I be!" By this time. a loaded gun in every hand was pointing toward the rye-field, and quick as thought, each muzzle turned toward the "plumed and painted" figure and gave terrible reply. The figure dropped, and all was silence. Guns were reloaded quickly and pointed again, but no sound came, and nothing was seen but a gentle motion of the rye, which might be caused by the light breezes passing over it. Hearing and seeing nothing for a long time, they went cautiously to the rye. The Indians, with the art and stealth of     ":   LEGEND OF LANCASTER. some wild creature of the woods, had crawled noiselessly away into the forest, leaving only the dead body of their broth- er, who trusted so rashly and so vainly to his agility, pierced with eight bullets.

WHEN I was a child I had two of the most delightful grandmammas in the world!  They were unlike, yet I never knew which I loved the best. Grandma Stoughton was a large fine- looking woman, with very handsome dark eyes which retained their youthful brill- iancy. She was born in the year 1750, in Massachusetts, in a part of the town of Gill which was then Deerfield, for in those days Northfield and Deerfield met; the latter taking in the pleasant town of Greenfield, with most of the lovely six miles of hill and meadow, nestled away , v   '      48   THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT. in a curve of the Connecticut River, which is now called Gill. She lived to extreme old age, and when I first remember her she was an aged wo- man, sitting serenely with her knitting in her chosen corner by the fireplace. Her hair, perfectly white, was put back under a cap of nice, clear book-muslin, fashioned like those the Friends wear, but with neatly crimped border, and tied with black ribbon, worn in mourning for her husband, who died many years before I was born. Cheerful as she always was, intelligent and beautiful to the very last, it was the great enjoyment of my childhood to run down the little hill to the dear old brown house, fronted by sugar-maples, where she lived alone with Aunt Fanny, and listen to the legends of New England, and to the quaint, curious ballads of the mother England, of which her almost per- fect memory contained a large store. On the Lord's day she told me the beautiful stories of the Bible, orJI read to her from the sacred page. If I read care-   THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT.   49 lessly, or-as I must confess was some- times the case-gave purposely new and original renderings, in order to test the accuracy of her memory, I never failed to hear her say, "It isn't so;" and then she would proceed to give the very words of the text; for she was learned in the Scriptures, and they became the rule of her life. Her never-failing antidote for sleepless- ness, I have often heard her say, was this: she began to go over mentally the history of Joseph in the Old Testament, commencing at the very beginning; and she invariably fell asleep, sooner or later, without ever reaching the sequel of the story. She was not a person who spoke of her own emotions, or allowed any one to share in her secret inner life; yet she once said to my mother that when she was left alone in the house for hours together, as she sometimes was, He of whom   the Scriptures testify came and bore her company.  I am talking now of her latter days;     50  THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT. but she was born in a time which seems to you very far back, the time when forests covered our New England, when wolves and Indians were something more than nursery tales, and the horrors of King Philip's -War were not yet ended, though King Philip himself was slain. So, as you will tell to your children, very likely, stories of the Great Rebellion, she used to relate stories of the red men of the forest to hers; and to her-youngest auditors she used to tell, as a variety from Mother Goose, this simple little legend, which you may read to your young brother or sister. "There was once a family lived in the woods that had a little boy named Der- rick. And there used to be a friendly Indian who came very often to little Derrick's house, and the father and mother always treated him well, and gave him something to eat, and he used to play with the little boy and was very fond of him, and little Derrick was very fond of the Indian. But one day, when the In- dian came to the white man's house and   I THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT.  51 inquired for little Derrick, the mother i   cried, and she said little Derrick was lost in the woods; they had hunted for him, but could not find him. Now this Indian had a large dog that used to follow him everywhere, and the Indian asked the mother to give him something that little Derrick had worn lately, and when she brought the garment he gave it to the dog to smell at; then he said something to him in the Indian language, and the dog started off and his master followed after him. The dog smelled carefully along on the ground, and then he ran along; then he put down his nose again and smelled to find the spot where little Der- rick stepped; so they went off in the woods out of sight. "But by and by the Indian was seen, coming back, bringing little Derrick in his arms, for the dog had followed his track till he found him, and then he I   barked very loudly. And so the good Indian gave little Derrick to his mother,    and she was very glad."    lMy. grandmother's mother had more Ig     52  THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT. than once, with her little ones around her, been terrified by the savage invaders. They lived in a log-house, on the west side of the Connecticut River, on a road that led through the woods from Deer- field to Northfield. The last alarm, from suspicion of In- dians lurking in this neighborhood, occur- red when my grandmother was but two years old. She would not have remem- bered an ordinary incident, but the sud- denness of the warning, the anxiety and active preparations of her mother, the secrecy and fear with whichl they went through the woods, impressed her mind so vividly that she never forgot it. One day, when her father was out ot town, an uncle of hers came in great haste, telling her mother that there were signs of Indians in the region, and it was supposed they had come from the far-off forests to lie in wait for captives. There was no time to lose; she must take her children and go immediately to the fort in Northfield. She was about making cheese, and the   THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT.   53 curd and whey, with the milk which she had in the house, was put into the pigs' trough. I suppose the pigs must have run in the woods, eating roots and acorns, and coming at stated periods to the house for other food. Then she wrote, in large letters, upon the door, with chalk, the word "IN- DIANS." This was to give her husband, on his return, to understand where she h:ad gone. So they started. There were, I be- lieve, five or six children, my grand- mother being the youngest at that time. The younger children were delighted with the idea of a walk along the woody road, and were ready to break out into exclama- tions of pleasure at the sight of partridge, squirrel, or hare, or better, at a glimpse of the pretty spotted fawns that fed there. But their mother and uncle hushed them, speaking in most subdued tones, and representing the dreadful consequences of attracting the attention of those frightful savages, who might be somewhere within hearing. =;     54  THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT. Cautiously they stole along the road through the woods for about two miles, then crossing the river, probably in a skiff, reached the fort in safety. Here they lived, with other families, for several weeks, my grandmother's father coming to them soon after he reached home. The fort was not attacked, and the alarm was probably a false one. The Indians never afterward came into that vicinity. A few years after this last alarm my grandmother's family moved a little more than a inile higher up the river, to "Grass Hill," a portion of Gill which then belonged to Northfield. A mile above Grass Hill, and opposite the village of Northfield, wherethe fort then stood, was "King Philip's Retreat." The le- gend says he had a resort and look-out here, as well as at Mount Hope in Rhode Island. It is, perhaps, a hundred feet above the river; a portion of table-land covered with trees. Huge trees were cut in logs, and piled here, ready for rolling down on   THE FLIGHT TO THE FORT.    55 the heads of the enemy; and here stood, but three or four years ago, an immense and exceedingly ancient-looking pine, which, according to tradition, was used by the royal Indian as a watch-tower. It, is said he kept one of his men among the branches continually, by day, watching the settlement of Northfield and   the movements of the whites for miles along the river. Behind the tree is a ditch, which was dug for defense, and toward the river the Retreat is extremely abrupt and steep. Here, according to that which the old inhabitants have handed down to us their descendants, was spent by the Indian hero one of the last summers of his life. We cannot but pity him  as we imagine him saying: We, the rightful lords of yore, Are the rightful lords no more; Like the silver mist we fail, Like the red leaves in the gale- Fail like shadows when the dawning Waves the bright flag of the morning.

SEVENTEEN years, as we reckon here on earth, has my maternal grandmother, Eunice Locke, been in heaven. We could scarcely weep on that triumphant day when she entered into the joy of her Lord; she had waited for it so long and so submissively, she had borne so many burdens and sorrows, and her last years had been so full of physical pain, which our tenderest love could only in part as- suage. I often try to imagine her face in that "exceeding gloryj" with the look of patient suffering all gone from it forever. She was a large, dignified woman, with pleasant, intelligent blue eyes under a   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.   57 mountain of forehead. Her light brown hair, filleted back under her cap, was scarcely turned gray, although she was nearly eighty-four when she died. She comes up to me oftenest as she used to look when I stole unawares upon her, sitting with the ghosts of the dead years thick about her. Her hands were ever busy, but her mind was in the past; and she would sigh heavily, and sometimes speak aloud. When I spoke to her she immediately became cheerful, and ready to converse with me on any subject: met- aphysics, theology,- the natural sciences, and even belles-lettres-she was at home in all these fields; but I liked best to hear her tell the spirited old legends she knew so well. "Long time ago," sitting in her cosy room by the little wood-fire, she told me this story of her early days, which I give nearly in her own words: "Often, in my young days and since, I have heard the aged say it seemed but yesterday since they bounded about the meadows and climbed the hills, but to me     58   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. it seems a long and weary pilgrimage back to the days of my childhood. I would not go back to them, no, not even to sit with my dear brother John on our old rock be- hind the house, with Mouldering-True, the buff and white mouser, at our feet; not even to look on the manly face, and hear again the voice of John Lawrence. Poor John Lawrence! he was sister Han- nah's beau, and a bright, handsome fellow he was. "One June evening John and I ate supper on the 'Rock of Vows,' as we had whimsically named our favorite resort. "I must have another slice of brown bread,' I said, and going into the house I heard father discoursing with Aunt Betty over their short-cake and currant-leaf tea. Father and Aunt Betty were the staunch- est Whigs; and though we lived forty miles from Boston, we eschewed the fra- grant leaf of China with the most patriotic Bostonian of them all. As I was saying, I heard father tell Aunt Betty, 'Now that there has been blood shed, we shall not rest till we drive them from the country.'   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.   59 Father was a slow-spoken man, but these words of his roused me like the beat of a drum. "'John,' said I, I only wish I were a man!' "' Is father talking about the British?' he asked. "'Yes; he says now that there has been blood shed we shall not rest till we drive them from the country.' " That's so!' said John; 'I only wish I had been born four years sooner, Eu- nice.' "'I wish we had been born twin broth- ers, and were sixteen now, and then we would go together,' I answered. 'I wish I could go into the army; but I will do something for my country yet, see If I don't, John!' "We started together, carrying our por- ringers instead of muskets, and marched as far as the threshold of the door, where we sat down to listen. "Aunt Betty was a school-teacher, and was somewhat past her youth at this time. She had been a belle and a great tfp. /(..' */  Xi: -.5?  'JA^     60   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. beauty, and had a romance of her own. She was now a sincerely pious person, strictly puritanical according to the spirit of the times, and full of faith, hope, and charity. She was saying it could not be but God would hear the many prayers offered for the country. My father re- plied, "' It is not to be doubted for a moment. God helps those who help themselves-I say it reverently. Our cause is a right- eous one, and the country is thoroughly aroused now. The women giving up their tea is not the least among the demonstra- tions of public feeling.' "Here Hannah and Lucretia looked at each other slily. Mother poured currant leaf decoction and said nothing. I knew as well as the 'great girls' that mother, who was not well, drank Bohea every day behind, the buttery door, but I was silent. 'One night I retired to rest with a strong feeling of patriotism swelling my heart. I slept with sister Hannah below stairs in one of the large square rooms.   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.  61 About the middle of the night I was awakened by Hannah starting suddenly out of bed. Then I heard a low knock on the window. Hannah threw her dress about her, went to the window, spoke to some one in a low voice, and then, com- ing to the bed, arranged her dress and went out. Immediately she returned to the house with a young man. It was John Lawrence. I heard him tell her that he did not go to the door because he disliked to disturb the rest of the family; that he had enlisted with the company raised from Ashby, (his native town;) that the company had stopped for the night at Townsend Harbor, two miles from father's, having orders to march for Concord the next morning; that he had obtained leave of a few hours' absence, and hastened ovel to bid her good-by. "'The country is all in a blaze,' he said; 'we shall have hot work yet.' "I do not remember any more of the conversation, though I was awake all the while listening to it. At length the cock crowed. He started and said, "It is     62   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. growing light. I pledged my honor to the. captain to return before sunrise. Good-morning. We shall not meet for many months.' And she replied in a tremulous tone, ' Good-morning.' "I did not fail to report to my brother John the next morning what I had heard. "'Hannah can give up her beau for her country, but what can I do 2 Never mind, our time will come yet, John.' "It was the next week, or the next but one after this, that an express came to town on Saturday night, and on Sabbath morning the news of the fight of Bunker Hill went about the congregation. Among the names of the fallen was that of John Lawrence. I cried all 'Sabber day.' A woman at meeting asked me what ailed me. I told her my head ached." (Now my grandmother was remarkably correct and modern in her pronunciation, and I was touched to perceive how fully she had gone back in spirit to those days of her childhood. She said "Sabber day" unconsciously, the word she would have used then coming to her lips.)   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.  63 "Hannah was from home at this time, and when she returned she appeared much as usual. She never spoke of her sorrow, but from that time she ceased to mingle in gay company, of which she had before been very fond. "And I never hear of the monument now going up on Bunker Hill but I think of poor John Lawrence. I think how in future years the gay and the careless will ascend it, feeling, if they feel at all, only the pride of victory; hearing only the shout of the jubilee of our independence. But for me, I hear the undertone of grief; I feel again the dread and the doubt, the impatient leaping of the blood; and I think painfully of the dead, of the name- less dead. I think of poor, poor John Lawrence. "Time passed on. James, my oldest brother, had already been two years in the army. Father was in the Massachu- setts Assembly at Boston. It must have been in the year '79, for I was a few months short of fifteen, when one morn- ing in May I came down stairs and found     "   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. mother in tears. She informed me that brother John was to 'march next day after to-morrow at sunrise,' notice having come to Townsend the night before that fifteen soldiers were wanted. The train- ing-band had been called out, and John had been one of those selected. He had come home late the night before, after all the family were in bed. Mother said that though John was supplied with summer clothes, he must be absent seven or eight months, and would suffer for winter gar- ments. There were at this time, you must remember, no stores out of Boston, and no articles to be had except such as each family could make for itself. "The sight of mother's tears always brought all my hidden strength of body and mind into action. I instantly asked what garment was needed. She replied pantaloons.' "' if that is all,' I said, 'we will spin and weave him a pair before he goes.' "'But.' said mother, 'the wool is on the sheep's back, and the sheep are in the pasture.'   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.   65 "I immediately turned to my younger brother, and bade him take the salt-dish and call them to the yard. "Mother replied: ( 'Poor child! there are no sheep shears within three miles and a half.' "'I have some small shears at the loom,' said I "'But you can't spin and weave it in so short a time.' "' I am certain we can, mother.' "' How can you weave it? There is a long web of linen in the loom.' "'No matter, I can find an empty loom.' "By this time the sound of the sheep made me quicken my steps toward the yard. I requested one of my sisters to bring the wheel and cards, while I went for the wool. I went to the yard with my brother, who seized a white sheep, from which I sheared with my loom-shears what I judged sufficient for half the warp; we then let her go with the rest of her fleece. I sent the wool in by one of my little sisters, and Calvin ran for a black     "   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. sheep, and held her while I cut off wool for my filling and half the warp. "When I reached the house I found my older sisters had commenced carding the wool into rolls, which I immediately began to spin. Sufficient yarn was spun, washed, sized, and dried that day; and before sunrise the next morning I started, with the yarn in my apron, and a lunch- eon of bread and cheese to eat while I wove, in search of an empty loom. Though all the neighbors had looms, I went into three houses before I f6und one unoccu- pied, a mile and a half away. The web was 'got in,' and before sunset it was fin- ished. I carried it home and washed it; my sisters and I wrung and dried it be- fore the large kitchen fire; then we cut and made the garment, which we finished two or three hours before my brother left; that is, in about forty-one hours from the time the wool was taken from the sheep's back, and without help from modern im- provements.

There were only my two young brothers, Luther and Calvin, at home; they were old enough to work, to be sure, but boys want a head; father was with the Assembly at Boston, mother was too unwell to attend to them, and men were not to be hired. * New England Currency.     68   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY. "People tell about hard times now; poor creatures, they don't know anything about it! "Well, I saw how matters were: the pumpkins were ungathered in the field, the corn and potatoes were unharvested, fences were down and cattle in the orchard. I said nothing that night, but the next morning, as soon as the gentleman who brought me had lef, I ran up stairs, and taking off my dress put on an old short- gown that had been laid aside in the back chamber, and a pair of cowhide shoes, and calling for my little sister's sun-bonnet, went out and looked about for the boys. I saw one, presently, running after the cattle. "'Luther,' said I, 'do you bring the oxen and yoke them; we are going to work.' "The oxen were brought, put before the cart, and driven to the field. Then we began to load pumpkins; we got in five loads of pumpkins that day, and two loads of corn. The corn, with the help of our sisters, we husked in the evening. The   EUNICE LOCKE'S STORY.   69 next day we heaped up the apples where they were secure from the cattle, and brought corn again to husk in the even- ing; we also pulled the beans that day. The next day we were employed in get- ting in potatoes. I made the little girls, Lavinia and Sophia, help pick them up. I do not know how many bushels there were, but I remember we brought two loads to the cellar. "We worked in this way day after day, and in a little less than two weeks, and before father came from Boston, the crops were secured from waste.

"A GOOD spring of water, close by the door, is such a handy thing," said Mrs. Risle. So Mr. Risle, who had no pleas- ure but to please his wife, built his cabin by the spring. "Whatever I have, I want plenty of fresh air; that makes a place so much healthier," said Mr. Darby. Therefore he squared and spliced together the logs that made the walls of his home, on a sightly hill. A sheltered spot, where his corn and rye would get an early start, better met Mr. Davis's ideas of comfort. So his cab- in was built where a wooded hill sloped   TIDINGS, MY LORD."   71 down behind and at the sides, while a glimpse of the river showed beyond the clearing in front. Thus each man built here and there, according to his own taste and conven- ience; and thus the bridle-paths, which first followed notched trees and finally broadened and hardened into roads, zig- zagged from one clearing to another, up hill and down, with no regard to the convenience or ease of travel, but only democratically bent on giving every in- habitant an equal privilege in the advant- ages of a highway. As years passed on, the cabins gave way to framed houses; and the fort to which, many a time, the frightened settlers had hurried for refuge--coming from many miles about, in terrible dr6ad of the lurk- ing Indians, who still hovered about the fair banks of the river which used to be theirs-was needed for a fort no more. Squakeag had become an old settlement, with the commencement of what is now a long and beautiful village street. It had also a high-steepled church, where' Legends of New England, 5      72   "TIDINGS, MY LORD." the people met on the Sabbath at the sound of the drum. At last it was thought the luxury of a bell could be afforded; and then, above the bell, there was a new vane attached, in the form of a cock. Early the next morning after these im- ,portant additions, the down-street ladies, looking from their respective windows, beheld-the wind having veered to the north during the night-the tail of the cockerel pointing directly toward their end of the village. Mrs. Larkin's window flew open, and so did Mrs. Doty's; while Mrs. Ballard came from across the street. "Do you see what them up-street rab- shabs have been doing?" asked Mrs. Lar- kin fiercely. "I guess I've got the use of my eyes," returned Mrs. Doty, no less fiercely. "I mistrusted they were doing some- thing to insult us when they were so busy fixing up that graven image yesterday. I was sure there would no good come of it, and I said as much to my husband," quoth   "TIDINGS, MY LORD."   73 Mrs. Ballard, who in her own esteem was something of a prophet, and one who fore- told chiefly evil. However, before nightfall the wind took a tack toward the southwest, and the fickle weathercock following it, the down-street mind received some new light on the sub- jects of aerology and mechanics, and sub- sided into its usual state of passive distrust of the up-street end of the village, until its jealousy should meet with new food. But there were other signs in' the air than the petty heart-burnings of a neigh- borhood. One Sabbath morning, when the sun and rain of April had just started the young grass and touched the swollen buds of the maples with a promise of spring; when the bluebirds and early robins were answering joyfully to each other; when the pink-lipped arbutus was beginning to open its fragrant buds under its coarse, contradictory leaves, the people of Squa- keag had assembled in their meeting- house, with composed and serious faces, at the ringing of the clear-toned bell high     74    "TIDINGS, MY LORD." up beneath the protecting wings of the weathercock. There was on their faces a curious look, which wab not quite fear, neither was quite as though up-street had been setting itself to put on airs above down-street. The voice of the preacher trembled as he prayed that the danger of these troub- ious times might be averted; but some- how the hearts of the congregation did not seem to be swayed by his words. Good Deacon Norcross irreverently blew his nose just at the most affecting passage, and Lieutenant Dickinson was seized with a violent fit of coughing; while Peter Finn, who had never much veneration for principalities and powers, contrived to overset accidentally a tin foot-stove with much clatter, and nobody seemed shocked.  Prayer being ended and the singing done, the sermon began, and had pro- ceeded as far as eighthly, when Gaffer Dalton's customary nap was broken in upon by the heavy step of a man who came hastily up the broad aisle.   "TIDINGS, MY LORD."   T5 He was covered with mud and dust;. his clothes and hair were in disorder, like one who had ridden far and fast on some urgent business. Coming to the seat of Lieutenant Dickinson, he whispered brief- ly in his ear, then, turning back, strode down the aisle, followed by the lieu- tenant. The people looked fearfully at each other; and presently Deacon Norcross left the house. One by one, all followed him, till the minister was left to finish his discourse to the walls and benches. One of the last to go was' sharp-eyed, stiff-necked Sam Noah, a man who always thought himself in the right, wherein he differed usually from everybody else; but having once made up his mind, Archi- medes himself couldn't have moved him. He had lately, as he said, been misused in some matter of trade by Lieutenant Dickinson, and if such things and such lmen were allowed in the Church, he, for one, had no respect for that body. To show this disrespect, he had come on this particular Sunday into the sacred edifice     76    "TIDINGS, MY LORD." wearing on his shoulders a gaudy, yet coarse and greasy, Indian blanket. At last even obstinate Sam Noah was moved to follow Lieutenant Dickinson and the rest of the congregation out of doors; for even he, thouglh he might not have given way from mere curiosity, would not stay to be classed as taking sides with the tory preacher. "There has been blood shed," said the messenger of tidings, excited and earnest, Sternly and gravely the dignified elders repeated to each other, "There has been blood shed!" "There has been blood shed," said the women, turning pale, as the horror of the present and the probabilities of the future flashed upon them. But their husbands and fathers had no fear or faltering in their tones as they said firmly, '"There has been blood shed at Lexington. Let us see to this matter." Whether the tory minister went on to the end of his discourse no one turned back to see, but mounting their horses on sad- dles and pillions, or hurrying on foot, all   "TIDINGSj MY LORD."   " went home, to spend the remainder of the day and night in melting up each his pew- ter platters and spoons for bullets--wooden plates and-spoons would do for those who remained behind; and as every one's gun differed from his neighbor's in pattern, each must depend on himself for bullets. Up-street and down-street feuds were all forgotten in the great common danger; and the next day, busy hands and brave hearts fitted off a company of their best- beloved ones to go forth in defense of what is now our goodly heritage. Thus the messenger went on, rousing at every hamlet and town the spirit of in- sulted patriotism that filled each breast; calling Putnam from his plow, and as stout an arm from almost every fireside, by the magic words, "Blood shed/!" For many a week and month old Gaf- fer Dalton, who was too old to fight and too feeble to work, sat on a log by the wayside during the long hours of every sunny day, calling in the cracked voice of age to every passer-by, "What's the news, hey What did you     78   4 "TIDINGS, MY LORD." say?

But it was at this time that England had determined to raise money by making the Americans pay not only the full price of certain articles which they sent to them, but a tax on them besides. One of these articles was tea. So the people of New England resolved they would buy no more tea. A few merchants in Boston, however, sold it privately, and Hannah's father was one who was supposed to do so. Just at this period large companies of British soldiers had been sent to Boston, and they were continually, in various ways, annoying the citizens. They had destroyed, out of pure malice, the snow- hills of the boys, and the latter had in- dustriously rebuilt them. When school was dismissed at night   THE SNOW-HLLS.    81 some of the boys took down their skates, which hung in the entry, while others ran for their sleds. "Come, M3ary Adams - come, Mary Ann," said Will Russell, "go and see us coast; there will be plenty of time." ' O no, it is almost dark now," said his sister. "Plenty of time. Come, little Patty, get on my sled; you shall ride to the Common." 'Yes; but do tie up my shoe first, Will. There, now we'll go. Mary Adams is almost there already." "What is the matter!" exclaimed Mary Ann; "Mary Adams is tearing back as though she were crazy; and there come Joseph and Paul!" Willard dropped the rope of the sled. "Those rascally soldiers!" he muttered, shutting his teeth hard and dashing off in wild excitement. Yes, they've done it again!" shouted Mary, her hood off her head and her dark curls flying every way; "and they've broken the ice on the pond too!"     82    THE SNOW-HLLS. "There are the soldiers just going away-how mean!' said Mary Ann. "And Hannah will be glad of it," said Patty, half crying. " there come the boys back again, and they look real angry." "Mary Ann, don't wait for me,'? said her brother as he came up. "We boys are going to complain to the captain; this is the second time they have spoiled our coasting." "-Stop in and tell me what the captain says, won't you, Will, when you come back?" said Mary Adams, her black eyes large with excitement. "What did the soldiers say, George?" asked Mary Ann of-one of the lads. Will told them they had no. right to beat down our snow-hills, and they said, Help yourselves if you can, young rebels,' and went off laughing." "I don't believe they know the golden rule," said little Patty. Mary Adams could scarcely eat her supper. As soon as she was excused from the table, she ran to the front windows   THE SNOW-HLLS.    83 to see if Willard were coming. After watching what seemed to her, in her im- patience, a long time, she saw him and ran to the door. "What did he say?" she asked eagerly. "IHe only laughed at us," said Will indignantly. "What will you do "' "Build our snow-hills again," was the decided answer. "And if they beat them down again 2" "Then we will hold a meeting," said he, and the tone of his voice meant a great deal more than his words. " let me go to it!" said the hoyden. Your aunt never would consent to that. Though, if John were well, I don't see as there could be any harm in your going with him. Good night,' he added, starting off on a run. "O John!" said Mary, flying into his sick-room, "I wish you were well!" "What is the matter now, Mary?" "O, John!" she began again, walking about the room, too excited to sit, "the soldiers have beaten down the boys' snow-     84    THE SNOW-HLLS. hills on the Common; they had beautiful hills to slide from down on to the pond, and now this is the second time they have spoiled them; and they called Willard Russell a 'young rebel' too, and he's been to the captain and the captain only laughed. I suppose he was glad of it! And the boys are going to have a meeting. O dear! I wish you could go!" "Where is the meeting?" asked John, starting from the great arm-chair in which he sat, his eyes full of fire. "O, John, sit down again; your fore- head is covered with perspiration. Aunt Eleanor will say I have made you sick." "Sick! I never was so strong in my life! Get my thick shoes, Mary." "Why, John, the meeting isn't to- night. You must sit right down again." "Well, then, run over and ask Willard to come to my room now-that's a good girl." In less than five minutes Mary stood, with a shawl over her head, on the steps of Mr. Russell's house, asking to see Wil- lard at the door.   THE SNOW-HLLS.    85 "O, Will," she began, ' I am afraid I have made John sick. I told him about the soldiers, and he is in such a fever, with the perspiration all out on his face, and he wants to see you." "' Fever' and ' perspiration ' Mary?" But he snatched his hat from the entry and went with her. "Mary, where are you going?" said her Aunt Eleanor as she was following Willard up stairs. "Come and take your work and sit down."' Mary obeyed; but of the state of her mind, as she sat with Aunt Eleanor's sharp eyes on her, I leave the black-eyed Fans and Sues who read this story to judge. The next morning Aunt Eleanor was surprised to see her nephew come down to breakfast. "You really seem a great deal better, John," said she. "The medicine the doctor left you yesterday has evidently broken up the fever. But you must be extremely careful. After these slow fevers one cannot but be very weak, and you had better continue the medicine."     86    THE SNOW-HLLS. "I don't need any more medicine, Aunt Eleanor. I want the fresh air. I am go- ing to the Common." "To the Common this sharp morning!" "Let the boy have his own way, sister," said his father, "the air wont hurt him." "I shall go too," said Mary with an emphatic shake of her curls. "It might be well for you to go with your brother, Mary," said her aunt; " but there is no occasion for your appearing so excited about it. It is not lady-like to manifest strong feeling, especially on such a slight occasion as this. Surely you are not going without eating, Mary! You have not touched your breakfast." But Mary was already putting on her cloak and hood. "John, what has cured you?-was it the medicine 2" said Mary as soon as the door closed behind them. "No, indeed! I never thought of the medicine after the doctor left it until Aunt Eleanor mentioned it. It was you and Willard cured me. We'll build the coasting-hills once more, and then see!"   THE SNOW-HLLS.    87 "But you are not going to work, John?' "Why not? I never felt better in my life." John possessed one of those tempera- ments which will sometimes, under the pressure of great and sudden excitement throw off disease, as Samson broke the new ropes with which the Philistines had bound him. There was already a multitude of boys on the Common. Some carried snow on their sleds, others rolled it in vast balls to the place of building, while others beat it into form. "Hallo, John Adams! what brought you here?" "God and my right!" said John stur- dily. This was received with shouts of ap- plause, and John immediately set about rolling balls of snow, and Mary helped him. When the work was finished there were some minutes remaining to the hour of school. "Come, Mary," said Willard, "you shall have the first slide on this hill ;" so) Legenda of New England. 6     88    THE SNOW-HLLS. with her brother to hold her on the sled, she flew swiftly down the slope and over the pond, while the boys cheered in triumph. At intermission the boys and many of the girls ran eagerly to the Common. Yes, the soldiers had again destroyed the work of the morning. ".Boys!" said Willard, in a voice that was heard above the tumult, "meet me to-night at the school-house at seven!" "Agreed! agreed!" they responded. At the appointed time and place a large number of boys convened. They had attended indignation meetings held y their fathers and older brothers, and so proceeded, according to precedent, to elect a chairman. "I think we had better have Willie Green for chairman," said one, "because he's too small to speak. Willie, you must keep a good look out, and have the one that gets the floor first speak first." "No," says Willie, "I don't want to be chairman. I am going to make a speech myself."   1^i     ; THE SNOW-HLLS.    8a The boys laughed, and Willie took his place by Mary, for Mary had coaxed John !!  into letting her go with him. Another moderator was chosen, and Willard took the floor. "We have met here to consider what ?   rwe shall do in defense of our rights. 'What business have these red-coats to come and domineer over us? We have not touched anything of theirs. We have not injured them in any way. We have borne their insults long enough. Some of us, as you all know, went to the captain. There he sat, with his bottles of wine before him, looking like Pharaoh king of Egypt, and when I told him how his men had treated us, he said, with a sneer, 'Well, what are you going to do about it?' I did not trust myself to say I  a word, I was so angry, but marched right out; and I thought to myself, 'I know now a little how William Tell felt when he saw the tyrant Gesler; and I felt in me, too, a little of the spirit of those Greeks we read about in our history, when they stood at the pass of Thermopylae. We've     90    THE SNOW-HLLS. built up our coasting-hills three times.  What shall we do next? is the question." Willard sat down, and John took the floor. "What shall we do next? We cannot fight and defend our rights, though, if things go on in this way, I can tell you there will be fighting here in Boston. We might revenge ourselves on the troops by doing them some mischief, but that would be making ourselves as mean as they are. The only plan I can think of is to go to General Gage and represent the whole affair to him." This proposition was loudly applauded, and put to vote without further speak- ing. Willard, John, and several others were appointed a deputation to wait on the commander-in-chief. "John," whispered Mary, "Willie Green wants to make his speech." Mary could sympathize with Willie Green, for she had been tormented the whole time with a desire to get up and make a speech herself. *         Hor   THE SNOW-HLLS.    93 'cHear Willie Green's speech," said John. "Come, Willie." Willie stood on a bench, and began after the manner of the boy-declaimers' h had heard at school. "Romans!-no, Bostonians!" said he, correcting himself at a whispered hint from Mary, "Countrymen! and Lovers! I don't like the red-coats. They threw down the snow-man Jimmy and I made on the Common. I want to frighten them away, and I think the best plan would be to get Mary's Aunt Eleanor to go and give them one of her looks-and a piece of her mind!" The shouts of laughter that met this proposal rather abashed young Brutus, and he hid behind Mary until the caucus adjourned. On the next day, which was a holi- day, the delegation called on General Gage. What do all these children want?" }I  said he, looking up from a letter he was reading. "We have come to demand satisfac-     92    THE SNOW-HLLS. tion," said Willard in a manly, respectful tone. The general looked angry. "What!" said he, " have your fathers been teaching you rebellion and sent you here to exhibit it?' It was now Willard's turn to grow spirited, and his eyes flashed at the word "rebellion." "Nobody sent us, sir," said he; "we have never insulted or injured your troops, but they have trodden down our snow- hills and broken the ice on our skating pond. We complained, and they called us young rebels, and told us to help our- selves if we could. We told the captain, and he laughed at us. Yesterday our works were destroyed the third time, and we will bear it no longer!' General Gage looked at the boy with astonishment and admiration. "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, turn- ing to an officer near him, " the very chil- dren here draw in a love of liberty with the air they breathe!

'"Well," said g'andpa, since it is Thanksgiving night I suppose I must." Nobody could tell stories like grandfa- ther, so the children thought. They were all in his room that Thanksgiving evening, with no light but that which proceeded from the bright hickory fire and the pine torch set up against the front log: just the light by which to listen to revolutionary stories. "When I was quite a small boy," began the grandfather, "there used to be a gun- house opposite the Common-I lived in Boston, you know-and this gun-house was next to the school-house where I went to school. A yard with a high fence around it was common to both. The gun-house had two doors : one opened to the street and the other into the yard. In the beginning of the RevolutionaryWar there were two small cannons bought by General Court for the use of the compa- nies in Boston, and put into the gun- house. General Gage had ordered that all the arms should be handed in at Faneuil IIall, and promised that if this              I'   STORY OF THE CANNONS.   97 were done he would allow the inhabitants to leave the town. One night my brother Sam came home a good deal excited, and would not eat any supper. Presently he started to. go out. I followed him to the doorsteps, and begged he would let me go. with him. He hesitated, and then said, "' Well, I believe you can keep a secret.' "So I went out with him. We went to Master Carey's-Master Carey was our schoolmaster. We found three other young men there, my brother's mates. I learned from their conversation that Major Paddock was going to give up the guns to General Gage. The men were a good deal roused about it, and they laid a plan to steal the guns." "Steal, grandpa 2" exclaimed Sophy. O, you see, Sophy," explained-Ed- ward, "the guns belonged to them; grandpa means steal in and get them." "O!" said Sophy. 'But, grandfather, why do you call them guns sometimes and cannons some- times?" said Arthur. "A cannon is a large gun," said his     98   STORY OF THE CANNONS. grandfather; "you will find it so in your dictionary." c Yes. Please go on, grandpa." "These were small cannons, and they laid a plan to take them from the gun- house and hide them. I was very much excited and wide awake, though it was long after my bedtime. I felt as though the affairs of the nation depended a good deal on my prudence and discretion. The master was lame, and he said though he could not take an active part in the mat- ter he might be of full as much use as though he could, "The next morning I went to school early. Master Carey was already there. When some of the boys, according to their custom, began to bring in wood to fill the wood-box, the master told them, "' No; pile up the andirons with wood, but don't fill the wood-box, we want that for another purpose;' and then he bade the boys to come to the desk: he had something to say to them. There were quite a number of boys there, though not nearly all the school.   STORY OF THE CANNONS.   99 "' Boys,' said the master, 'all who are in favor of the British hold up your hands.' Not a hand was raised; and some of the boys put their hands behind them with a jerk. "Well, now, shall General Gage have our guns, or shall the Boston boys have them, to fight the red-coats with? All depends on whether you are able to keep a secret. Handsup, all who are able to keep a secret.'  "Every hand came up with energy. '"'Now you may take your seats.' "We were no sooner in our seats than my brother Sam came in, with the other young men I had seen at Master Carey's the evening before. 'All right,' said the master. Sam went to the desk where the master sat, and opened the wood-box, which was under the desk-it was a very large box, large enough to hold our back- logs-and then they all went out, leaving the door open behind them. "I looked out of the window, and saw them all go to the door of the gun-house     100  STORY OF THE CANNONS. that opened into the yard. They thrust a stick through the. crevices of the door and- went in, but immediately came out bringing the cannons, which they had taken off the carriages. Sam and Torn Stevens brought in one, and the other two young men followed with the other. They placed them in the wood-box and shut down the lid, and Master Carey laid up his lame foot on it. The young men went out immediately, and shutting the door of the gun-house, passed into the street. "They had not been gone five minutes when I saw two British officers come in- to the' yard from the gun-house. They searched the yard, and then came into the school-house. "'We must be allowed to search the school-room,' said the sergeant politely to, the master. ' Certainly, gentlemen,' answered he. "They looked under all the scholars' desks, in the closet, and in the loft of the school-house. Brother Sam had followed in after them very carelessly. I should have laughed to see the innocent look he   STORY OF THE CANNONS   101 put on if I had not been so anxious, fear- ing every minute they would look in the box. They did not, however, but went off, greatly vexed. My brother staid behind. "'Wasn't that well done ' he said to the master. 'We took the time when they were calling the roll, and they didn't hear us. I went into the street,' he con- tinued, 'and followed them in when they unlocked the other door. They appeared thunderstruck when they found the guns were gone; and the sergeant said with an oath, "These fellows would steal the teeth out of your head while you are keeping guard." "Master Carey and my brother laughed heartily, and Sam went on to say, "' Then they began to search the yard. a' They can't have gone out at this gate," they said, "because there is a cobweb across it."' "Here the rest of the scholars began to come in, and my brother left. I durst not even look at the wood-box all day long. Some of the older boys who were first at school took it upon themselves to replenish     102  STORY OF THE CANNONS. the fire from the wood-house during the day. The same thing was done the next day, and the next, till a fortnight had passed. "One evening I saw my brother starting off with a large trunk on a wheelbarrow. He saw me looking wistfully after him, and told me to come if I liked. We met Tom Stevens at the corner of the street, and all went directly to the school-house. They brought out the guns and put them in the trunk, while I kept watch in the yard. The trunk was then wheeled to a blacksmith's shop at the South End, and the guns hidden under the coal.' .Then I felt lightened of a heavy load of responsi- bility. "After that, I used occasionally to ask my brother, very privately, what had be- come of the cannons. At last he told me they had been carried off in a boat in the night, and were safe within the American lines. I never ventured to tell the story until long after peace was declared, and I know the other boys kept the secret ae safely as'I did."   STORY OF THE CANNONS.  103 Here the grandfather paused, and then mother said, "Don't you think there was something as noble in the silence of these boys as in the more active part of the young men?" "O certainly, mamma," said Edward; "but wd have no occasion to be noble by silence in these days." "Have we not " said she. "I thought it required full as much nobleness to keep silence when provoked, to be meek under insult, as was evinced by these boys." Y-e-s," said Edward hesitatingly. -But Arthur said, "I don't see into that." ' Can't you see, Arthur," said his grand- father, " that it required as much courage for George Washington to confess to his father that it was he who had ruined the cherry-tree with his little hatchet, and then again to tell his mother about the sorrel colt, as it did to perform daring exploits like that at Princeton?" "What exploit was that, grandfather?" "NWhy, in the heat. of the battle, you see, his men began to give way, and he snatched a standard from an ensign and Legends of New England. 7     104  STORY OF THE CANNONS. spurred his horse forward between the two armies, as an example for his men." ", I wish I had been there! I would have followed him," said Edward. His mother smiled. "Don't you sup- pose, Edward, if you should try to break yourself of some of your faults, you would find it all you were equal to, without fighting the British? A very wise man once said, 'He that is. slow to anger is bet- ter than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.'  Edward smiled back to his mother. "You are right, dear mother." Edward was a little quick-tempered, as all the family knew, and none better than himself; but he had that beautiful spirit of candor and readiness to confess a fault, that is as loveable as it is rare. "And then again," their mother went on, "it often requires far more bravery to do right when you know you will be ridi- culed for it, than it does to rush into bat- tle. It requires a good deal of courage, does it not, boys, to say 'No' when the boys ask you to smoke a cigar with them,   STORY OF THE .CANNONS.  105. and you know they will laugh at you if you refuse?" Arthur was hit this time. But nobody made any answer. Little Sophy had long been asleep in her grandfather's lap, and their father coming in just at that time they had prayers and bade each other good-night, and so ended Thanksgiving evening and the conversation by firelight. *   .   , 6?  }     SONG.

JUST at the close of the Revolutionary war there was seen, somewhere in one of the small towns of central Massachusetts, a ragged and forlorn-looking soldier com- ing up the dusty street. He looked about on the corn-fields tasseling for the harvest,' on the rich, bright patches of wheat ready for the sickle, and on the green potato-fields, with curious eyes-so at least thought Mr. Towne, who was walk- ing leisurely behind him, going home from the reaping to his supper. The lat- ter was a stout farmer, dressed in home- made brown linen trowsers, without sus- penders, vest, or coat. The ragged sol- dier stopped under the shade of a large   THE RAGGED SOLDIER.   109 sugar-maple, and Mr. Towne, overtaking him, stopped also. ' Home from the wars?" he asked. "Just out of British clutches," re- plied the man. "I've been a prisoner for years." He rejoined suddenly, "Can you tell me who lives in the next house  is it yours?" "No," replied Mr. Towne; "Tomp- kins lives there. That house and farm used to belong to a comrade of yours, as Isuppose. His name was Jones; but he was shot at Bunker Hill, and his widow married again." The soldier leaned against a tree. "What kind of a man is he I meal., what kind of people are they there?" he asked somewhat faintly. "Would they be likely to let a poor soldier have some- thing to eat?" "If Tompkins is out," said Mr. Towne, "you'd be treated first-rate there. Mrs. Tompkins is a nice woman, but he is the snarliest cur that ever gnawed a bone. He is a terrible surly neighbor, and he leads her a dog's life. She missed it mar-     "O-  THE RAGGED SOLDIER. rying the fellow; but you see she had a hard time of it with the farm after Jones went off soldiering; and when my son came back and said he was dead he saw him bleeding to death on the battle-field- she broke right down, and this Tompkins came along and got in to work for her, and he laid himself out to do first-rate. He somehow got on the blind side of all of us, and when he offered himself to her I advised her to have him, and I am sorry I did it. You had better come home with me; I always have a bite for any poor fellow that has fought for his country." "Thank you kindly," returned the sol- dier; "but Mrs. Tompkins is a distant- a sort of old acquaintance. The fact is I used to know her first husband, and I guess I will call there." Mr. Towne watched him as he went up to the door and knocked, and saw that he was admitted by Mrs. Tompkins. "Some old sweetheart of hers, may be," said Mr. Towne, nodding to himself. "He comes too late; poor woman, she   THE RAGGED SOLDIER.   11l has a hard row to hoe now." Then Mr. Towne went home to supper, and we will go in with the soldier. "Could you give a poor soldier a mouth- ful to eat?" he asked of the pale, nervous woman who opened the door. "My husband does not allow me to give anything to travelers," she said, " but I always feel for the soldiers coming back, and I'll give you some supper if you wont be long eating it," and she wiped her eyes with her white and blue checked apron, and set with alacrity about providing re- freshment for the poor man, who had thrown himself in the nearest chair, and with his head leaning on his breast, seemed too tired even to remove his hat from his face. "I am glad to have you eat, and I wouldn't hurry you for anything," sht said in a frightened way; " but you'll eat quick, wont you'? for I expect every min- ute he will be in." The man drew his chair to the table, keeping his hat on his head, as though he belonged to the Society of Friends; but S  .   y    .

"Dear me," she said to herself, "if he only knew, he wouldn't be so cruel as to let Tompkins come in and catch him here." She went and looked from the window uneasily; but the soldier gave no token of his meal coming to an end. "Now he is pouring vinegar on the cold cabbage and potatoes. I can't ask him to take those away in his hand. O dear, how slow he is! hasn't the man any teeth!" At last she said mildly, "I am very sorry to hurry you, sir, but couldn't you let me spread some bread and butter, and cut you some slices of meat, to take away with you? My husband will use abus- ive language to you if he finds you here." Before the soldier could reply, footsteps were heard on the door-stones, and imme- diately a man entered. He stopped short, and looked at the soldier as a savage dog ii   THE RAGGED SOLDIER.  113 might look. Then he broke out, in a tone between a growl and a roar, "Hey day, Molly! a pretty piece of business! What have I told you time and again, madam! You'll find you had better mind your master. And you, you lazy, thieving vagabond, let me see you clear out of my house and off of my land a good deal quicker than you came on the premises!" "Your house! and your land!" ex- claimed the soldier, starting suddenly up, erect and tall, and dashing off his hat with a quick, fiery gesture. His eyes were flashing lightning, and his lips quiv- ered with indignation, as he confronted the astonished Tompkins. The latter was' evidently afraid of him, and his wife had given a sudden nervous, shriek when the soldier first started to his feet and flung off his hat, and had sunk trembling and half fainting in a chair, for she recognized him. "You haint any business' to interfere between me and my wife," said Tompkins sulkily, cowed by the attitude of the soldier.     "4   THE RAGGED SOLDIER. "1Ybur wife!" exclaimed the soldier with the very concentration of contempt expressed in his voice, and pointing at him with an indignant finger. "Who are you?" asked Tompkins, with an air of effrontery. "I am Harry Jones, since you ask,"' replied the soldier, " the owner of this house and this land, which you will leave this very hour! As for Molly," softening his tone as he turned to the woman, now sobbing hysterically, " she shall choose between us.." "O Harry!" sobbed she, while Tomp- kins stood dumb with astonishment, "take me, save me!" With one step he was at her side, hold- ing her in his arms.

THE RAGGED SOLDIER.   115 fore everybody in the town knew that Harry Jones had come home, alive and well, to rescue his much-enduring, patient wife from a worse constraint than that of a British prison; but what they all said, and what Harry said, and what Molly felt, I must leave you to imagine, for here the legend ends. It used to be told us by my great-uncle-the brother of my grandmother who went to the fort-him- self a Revolutionary soldier.     "TTLE TIMMY. "But my country called for helpers, And I couldn't stay behind." IT was a sultry August day in the yea 1777. My grandfather was on his way t4 the harvest-field. He stopped suddenly "That cannot be the sound of Turner' Falls," he said to himself, somewhat start led, "it comes from an opposite direction.' He stood still a moment, and then turne( and went with a quick step into the house "There is a battle somewhere to the nortl of us," he said in a highly excited tone "come to the door and listen." My grandmother went out with him little Timmy holding by her hand, an( the older children following. There came from the northwest a dull heavy, continuous roar, like the sound o:   No. 733. Listening to the Roar of Battle.     1 i i,   "TTLE TIMMY.    119 some great waterfall. Later in the day it became more apparent, and the boom of cannon was distinctly heard above the unceasing roar of the guns. "Stop, Mr. Doolittle!" said one of my grandfather's neighbors to another who was grinding a scythe at his -grindstone; "stop, sir, and hear that sound. There is fighting to the northward. Why don't you stop; I tell you that's the roar of artillery!" and the tone grew impatient and emphatic. "Well, it's a good ways off," indolently responded the phlegmatic Doolittle. Mr. Doolittle and my grandfather pos- sessed different temperaments. News came leaden-footed in those days; but when from mouth to mouth went the story of the fierce fight of Bennington, where the vollies of musketry were, in the words of General Starks dispatch, "like a continued clap of thunder," when the North, stirred by the tidings of Stark's great victory, was roused to intercept the progress of Burgoyne, my grandfather laid down his sickle and went on with     120    LITTLE TIMMY. the company, in which he served as lieu- tenant, to join General Gates. A little more than two months after the events sketched above, the company in which my grandfather went out was disbanded. The terrible battle of Bemis's Heights had been fought, and Burgoyne had sur- rendered to General Gates. With quick, light steps the lieutenant walked the last mile of the one hundred he had traveled on foot from Saratoga. He was almost home. All the way of the wearisome journey he had been haunted with dreadful memories of that night which, just away from Saratoga, he had spent among wounded soldiers in a barn. He could hear again the terrific groans of that stalwart man whose deep cries of pain had filled the building, and echoed far out into the night, ceasing suddenly and forever just before daybreak; he could hear again the gentle voice of the little wife who sat in a manger supporting in her arms her wounded husband through the long hours. All these days of his   "TTLE TIMMY.    121 homeward travel the sounds of pain had followed and overtaken him, had kept him waking at night, or come to him in dreams. But now the roar and rush of battle, the smoke, the thunder, and the shouting, the cries of the wounded and dying, had all passed away like, a panorama.; the last scene had been exhibited, and the curtain had dropped. He thought now of the smile his handsome dark-eyed wife would wear as he stepped upon the door-stone. Perhaps she would catch sight of him at the kitchen window, and come to meet him in the road. The little ones would be sure to see him. A few minutes more and the mountain would appear covered with the gold and crimson glory of Octo- ber, then the oak tree, the well sweep, and the gambrel roof. Little Timmy would run out through the open gate to meet him and lead him in. He hurried on. The dear old mount- ain came in sight, and then the house.

His heart was like lead within him, but he hastened on with quicker steps. Who is hidden in the little painted box they are bearing forth so carefully? Ah, theie is a darker shadow than the old oak's across the yard! The funeral train, passing out of the gate, saw the soldier and recognized him. They set down the little coffin and waited. Lit- tle Timmy would never run again to meet his father! The lieutenant's heart was full of grief. He believed the child was walking beneath the immortal trees of the celestial gardens, and he thought of Da- vid's words: "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me." "I shall go to him!"Yes; but the lieutenant was a young man then, and it might be a long, long time before he could meet the little one again. Fifty years ago my grandfather, "full of days," passed away from earth. Who knows but at the gate beyond the river it was little Timmy met him, and led him in to an everlasting habitation in the city of our Lord.   WHAT AUNT HESTER SAYS OF THE HARD TIMES.

'THERE is a perfect furor of enthusi- asm in our ward. The ladies are doing wonders and miracles in the way of work for the soldiers," said Miss Pauline, set- tling her flounces gracefully about the ottoman. My Aunt Hester gave a little, quick laugh, the tone of which I understood, though Miss Pauline did not. I looked up at her, but she was quietly intent on her knitting; it was a thick, heavy sock, ribbed all the way to the foot. "Such sacrifices as our ladies do make;     124  WHAT AUNT HESTER SAYS it is unprecedented!"Miss Pauline pro- ceeded to say. Pauline inherited some French blood, which might perhaps account for what my sister Rose called her "exclamatious way." "Y-e-s," I replied hesitatingly; "the girls of Carthage, to be sure, cut off their hair for bow-strings, but that wasn't much. I've often wished I had an excuse to cut off mine, it is so much trouble to dress it." "O dear!" said Miss Pauline in dismay; "that would be a sacrifice." She wore hers in long, picturesque, jetty curls. "We doubtless make as great sacrifices as any women ever did in the cause of freedom, giving up our friends to go to the battle-field," I said. "You don't know what you are talking *about, girls," here broke in Aunt Hester brusquely. "Sacrifces!" she exclaimed contemptuously,looking at Miss Pauline's feathers as she spoke; "I should think you'd know better, Julia." I did know better, but I was partly try- ing to fall in politely with Pauline's way   OF THE HARD TIMES. -  125 of talking, and partly thinking of some one who went in the company that started last week. I said nothing, however. "It seems only yesterday," continued Aunt Hester, "that I sat at my grand- mother's knee, and heard the stories of the 'days that tried men's souls.' My grandfather was among the men that fought for the old eagle first of all. My grandmother kept her little ones alive on a little meal-a little rye and a little In- dian-for months; and I've heard my aunts and uncles say they were just as hungry, and perhaps hungrier, when they had eaten their bit of bread than they were before. Their teeth had such a longing to bite into something! They used to chew bark, and gum, and bits of straw to keep their teeth in practice, and then they went to the woods for checker- berry leaves, and sometimes they had ber- ries. My Uncle Eben said one day they had no dinner; and a faint clamor had as- sailed their mother's ears for an hour or two.

There was old John Molens, who wasn't very bright, and he didn't go a-soldiering with the rest, and he used to go about and swingel out the flax. Well, as I was saying, my grandmother laid down the linen garment she was making, ('American manufac- ture,' mind you,) and looking very cheer- fully at them, rose up. "'Come, children,' she said, 'I am go- ing to show you something.' She led them across the mowing out to the rye-field. 'Just look here, children,' she said, 'it wont be many weeks and there will be bushels and bushels of ripe grain here, and then we will send it off to the mill, and the meal will come home, and we will have as much bread as we can eat.' "Then she began to sing a little hymn to herself.

We may without overmuch searching, each day, Find some sort of ugly great dragon to slay. WESTWOOD. LIVING in the town of Rockingham, Vermont, in the last century, was a family named Simonds. Vermont, in the days of my story, was a wild new country, to which people went as they now go to Minnesota or the terri- tories beyond, building huts of logs, and cutting away the forest about them for acres, sowing, in the place of the tall trees, wheat and rye, and planting large fields of Indian corn. What strange cries might have been heard by night in these forests! Some- thing more, you may be sure, than the call of the katy-did and the whip-poor-     130    A BEAR STORY. will, the noise of frogs and the hoot of the sullen owl. For panthers, wolves, and bears lived in the dark of the woods about these clearings; and sometimes the settler would be startled from sleep by the squeals of the distressed mother of the family of pigs, and then he knew that without doubt a large clumsy black bear had scrambled over the sides of the pen (which was, by the way, built of logs, and thatched with hemlock bark) and possessed himself of one of her young ones. But I was going to tell you about the family named Simonds. They had a nice field of corn at a little distance from the house, and night by night a bear made havoc in it. She brokeadown the corn, she tore off the ears, she ate, she trampled under foot, she wasted most inconsiderately. They set the bear-trap in the field, but it was care fully avoided. One morning two of the boys went out as usual to look at the trap. There it stood, with its huge jaws voraciously open, the cruel teeth holding nothing.   A BEAR STORY.     131 They took up the trap to move it to another spot. "What is that so black on that tree, Elijah?." asked John suddenly. John was about eleven years old, while Elijah was thirteen or fourteen. The boys made as fast as possible toward the tree, carrying the heavy trap between them. On the tree were two little cubs, only just large enough to climb, clinging among the branches. "Brother," said Elijah in a most ex- cited tone "I have a plan: one of us must go up and punch the cubs to make them cry, while the other shall hold the trap down here, and catch the old bear in it when she comes." "Yes," said John. "Well, have your choice, John."' "I'd rather stay with the trap." Without further words, up went Elijah to tease the little bears and infuriate their mamma. Poor little bears! They were greatly alarmed at the sight of that rough, clam- bering boy intruding into their green     132    A BEAR STORY. withdrawing-room, and they trembled and cried out piteously for their mother. In a moment something black was seen on the top of a hillock, and on rushed the angry, savage beast directly toward the nursery where she had left her darlings. "What are you doing at the foot of my tree, you ugly boy! Now I'll, eat you right up!" said she, by "' actions" which "speak louder than words." John was holding the large trap open before him, his back against the tree, the. end of the trap resting on the ground, when the bear dashed at him furiously, with mouth wide open. Snap went the trap, and poor Mrs. Bruin was fast.* Home went the boys, each of them car- rying a cub. "Father! Brother Gardner! we've caught a bear! '" " Yes! I held 'the trap, and. the old bear ran at me with her mouth wide open, and ran her head right into the trap; and there she was! See the cubs! The old bear is in the trap now!" * See Frontispiece.   A' BEAR STORY.     133 "Impossible!" said Mr. Simonds. Impossible!' said Brother9 Gardner. But they went back with the boys, and there, sure enough, was the mother bear at the foot of the tree, muzzled with the heavy trap. So she was shot, and her meat filled the pork-barrel. Even at this distant-day I cannot but feel sorry in my heart for that poor mamma of a bear. But I dare say all the boys who read this story will feel altogether on the side of Elijah and John; and to you, older ones, who will understand me, I C:   cannot help saying that I wish a certain other black bear that we know of, a savage, malicious beast that has trampled, de- 5I yvoured, and wasted in Uncle Sam's corn- fields to its heart's content, were as effect- ually trapped and gagged.      MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. The wisdom that we suffer to Is wiser than a creed.-ALICE CAREY. MR. MARDY had drawn a prize at the lottery in Greenfield. This was fifty years ago, when lotteries were fashionable in Massachusetts, when they were tolerated and recognized in that state bylaw. There were the "Cambridge College Lottery," and the "Hatfield Bridge Lottery," for the building of the bridge and the benefit of the university; then there were besides, important pin-lotteries of Young America, which were sometimes money out of pock- et-or rather " pins out of pocket," says a critic at my elbow-to the incautious, in- experienced ticket-venders. But to return' to Mr. Mardy. He had drawn, as I said before, a prize in the Greenfield Lottery. If you have ever in a   MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. 135 J  story of Mr. Irving's read of a man named I  Rip Van Winkle, you may understand very I  much what sort of a man this Mr. Mardy was, for the description of the one would almost answer for the other. But Mrs. Mardy did not at all resemble the notable Mrs. Van Winkle. She was a simple, easy, good-natured person, who would gladly have things decent if she could, but had no disposition to wear herself in fretting. To be sure, she would have been glad if they could have had better legs to the crazy table; the old cheese- press had given out; and there were in- numerable other articles to be repaired or replaced by new ones. More than all, they had a debt of forty or fifty dollars, which had been hopelessly accumulating from year to year. So it was a joyful day with the Mardys when it was found that their ticket had drawn a prize of five hundred dollars. The grocery bills and other debts were all paid, the desirable renovations made in the furniture, arid still there was found to be somewhat re- maining.     136 MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. ( We will buy a great pulpit Bible with the rest," said Mrs. Mardy; "our little Bible is so racked to pieces that I never can find the text in it." So far it would seem as though they were doing well, and a lottery ticket was a good and desirable investment. "We must be sure to save enough for buying another ticket," said Mr. Mardy; which they did. About the time the prizes were drawn again in Greenfield, a young man from that place rode out to the town in which Mr. Mardy lived. "Mr. Mardy, I came to see if you would like to sell your lottery ticket." Mr. Mardy's heart beat fast. "Then it has drawn a prize," he said to himself; but concealing his excitement, he replied as quietly as he could that ie didn't care about selling it. "Will you sell it for a hundred dol- lars?" "No," said Mr. Mardy, more firmly. "Two hundred, then?" "The ticket has certainly drawn a large   !   "MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. 137 prize," said Mr. Mardy again to himself. "O no," he answered aloud, "I wouldn't take two hundred for it." "Suppose I say five hundred?" asked the young man. : "No sir; I don't wish to sell my ticket at any price." "What, not for a thousand dollars?" "No sir," said Mr. Mardy, very decid- edly. The young man from Greenfield rode away. Mr. Mardy went into the house. -  " "It seems our ticket has drawn over a thousand dollars. I shouldn't wonder if it was two thousand. What do you think of that, mother?" ",Over a thousand dollars! how did you hear? What can we do with so much money  Who told you?" "Why, you see one of them fellows from Greenfield just came up and offered me a thousand dollars for my ticket. I shouldn't wonder a bit if it is two thou- sand dollars that we are worth."

"Yes, Betty shall have a necklace of gold beads. Why Mrs. Smith! come in; I didn't see you, we were so busy talking. You see, we've drawn a prize, over two thousand dollars.

'"I mean to kill the setting hen wher I get home, and make some short-cake Have Mr. Smith come in to supper. We shall have to have your saddle and pil lion; ours is all to pieces." The horse was brought to the door il   MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. 139 due time, the saddle and pillion on his back. Mr. and Mrs. Mardy mounted. "Who was it told you of our good luck, father " That was young Creighton, I believe; he is one of the lawyer's sons down there. You may depend he knew what he was about."  .  "I've a good mind to get me a new bonnet while we are down in Greenfield, Mr. Mardy. Why wouldn't it be a good : ;plan to buy that orchard-lot Mr. Brown wants to sell? We might stop and have him give us the refusal of it when we come back." '4  *To these propositions the easy husband assented, and in like discourse the five miles to Greenfield soon passed. They went immediately to the shop where the tickets were sold. "  What has this ticket drawn?" asked Mr. Mardy, handing his ticket to the clerk of the office. :4 The clerk looked at the ticket, and then opened a book and drew his finger slowly down the columni of names. i?     "O MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. Mrs. Mardy leaned against the counter, with her lips apart, and with anxious- looking eyes. "This ticket," said the clerk, speaking with all moderation, "has drawn-a blank.' "What!" exclaimed the husband and wife at once. "A blank, I said." "Look again," said Mr. Mardy; "you must have made a mistake." "I am correct," said the young man. The Mardys were unable to conceal their chagrin. "Then what did that fellow mean?- young Creighton-he offered me a thou- sand dollars for my ticket this morning!" "Who? .Ned Creighton?" "I don't know; he is Squire Creigh- ton's son. He came up and offered me a thousand dollars for my ticket. I wish now I'd taken him up on his offer, but I thought 'twould likely be as much as two thousand dollars." "Did he really offer you a thousand dollars?"   MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. 141 "Yes, I thought he did. Well, perhaps lhe didn't exactly offer; he asked if I'd take it.' "And you refused 2" "Yes sir.' ' Just like him," said the clerk, no longer able to prevent himself from shak- ing with laughter; 'one of his jokes. Why he knew all about it; he belongs to the concern." The crest-fallen Mardys took their old place on horseback. "I hate to have the Smiths know it, dreadfully. I'd rather not have had the five hundred dollars, and then we shouldn't have made such geese of ourselves buying another ticket," said Mrs. Mardy. "I be- gin to think what the minister said about lotteries is true. I thought it was only one of his strict notions." "What was that? I didn't know as he said anything about lotteries." "Mrs. Marsh told me. She said that she heard him tell her husband that he didn't consider buying lottery tickets a  right way of spending money-his very it      "2 MR. MARDY'S LOTTERY TICKET. words, Mrs. Marsh said they were. I asked her why?--it was surprising to me he could think so; and she said it was to her. Well, she said that he said there was a kind of entanglement and bewitch- ment about it-I don't know as I can give justly his words--but a person is led on to buy one ticket after another, and the money mostly goes into the hands of a few speculating kind of people that want to get rich without working for it. But we agreed that Mr. Munsell always was rather strict in his notions, and I thought no more of it."  "It is a vexation, any way, to be so dis- appointed just as we thought we could live on our money," said her husband. "I don't care half so much about that; but I hate to be town-talk, and we shall be. You must tell the Smiths I've con- cluded I sha'n't kill the hen." When they reached home, Mrs. Mardy, taking off her bonnet in the little bed- room, looked down on the "great pulpit Bible," which chanced to lie open oppor- tunely on the low chest of drawers before   MR.

Not only quiet and in-   MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. 145 land, but it was so young a town that it lI  had but just finished and dedicated its first church, and was but just named. The name came in this way. While the church was yet a mass of wood and stone, the governor, riding through the Connecticut valley, and being attracted by the natural beauty of this spot of land lying in the river's bend-as Indians and white men had been before him-bestowed his own name upon it; and as it was but a short one, and therefore a small gift, he bestowed therewith a large pulpit Bible, with the edges of the leaves painted so bright a yellow they were as good as gild- ed, a communion service which shone like silver, besides glass and nails enough for the church which was to be to furnish three of moderate pretensions. But when one has meat enough, why not put it in the pot? So' the result shows an array of glass which would do-credit to any con- servatory. Raising, bell-hanging, and dedication being passed, the fourth great day in the history of the church came in due -time,     "6  MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. and this was on the occasion of Mr. John Jackson's ordination. Nothing else had been talked of for a month, and for this dresses had been made, chickens picked, and houses set in order; for a part of ordination was a great dinner at every house, beginning with the inevitable "boiled pot," and ending With election cake, while all manner of pies, puddings, and preserves came in between, not to mention a turkey or two and a baked pig. To this everybody from abroad, whether acquaintances or not, were ex- pected as welcome guests. So from the chimney of every gambrel roof came a huge column of smoke, which was an in- dex of the hospitality and good cheer pre- paring below. An hour before service time the road was gay with groups of chintz and muslin; while now and then a stout matron came on horseback, with perhaps a child in hei lap, and another on a pillion behind, cling ing to her gown. "There comes mammy on her old trot- ting-nag! Now I'll tell her my mind   MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. 14[ j/ - about these mitts, for she had no business to fix me up so," said Fanny to herself !2  looking disdainfully at her hands. ;:   Mitts made of cloth were at this time fashionable among the Eugenies of that    simple people, and Fanny's mother sat up :   late the night before to make her a pair; but I must admit the material was not the   . most stylish imaginable, being doubtless selected rather with a view to her store than to the style, and having once served in the capacity of stockings. Fanny was disgusted when she put them on, and the disgust increasing every moment, by the time the pacing nag and its rider appeared she was bursting with indignation, and ready to give voice to her disapproval More especially as her mother, being on horseback, could not turn upon her sud- denly with a chastising hand; and as there was a long hill before them, she was riding slowly and must hear. Fanny was gifted with a capable tongue, and excited by her fancied wrongs, it was more powerful than usual, and quite too much for her placid, easy-tempered mother i       "8  MR. JACKSON'S. ORDINATION. "I won't hear you talk so," said she, with a weak show of authority, starting the pacing nag into a trot in spite of the hill. So Fanny was left to grumble alone. (' I won't wear such old duds," said she, fiercely snatching them off and throwing them spitefully over the stone wall. Then as she esteemed her hands handsome ones she felt less mortified, though they were bare, and trudged on considerably relieved by this expression of her wrath. The great square pews were full long before the bell had stopped tolling, and so was the gallery, which extended around three sides of the church, with seats for the singers in front and pews behind. As the bell struck its last note the offi- ciating ministers walked up the broad aisle, an imposing procession, inspiring awe in a congregation trained to look with rev- erence upon the clergy. They went sol- emnly up the pulpit stairs, and it was a long way up, let me tell you; then quite disappeared from the vision of those who were so unfortunate as to sit in the first side pews, nothing more being seen of   MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. 149 them, excepting an occasional glimpse of hair with a gleam of forehead beneath it, as the speaker turned that way. Far above the pulpit hung the sound- ing-board, apparently held in its place by a white hand, supposed by some of the younger ones to be the hand of the Lord; and O, what if it should get tired and drop its burden! But Fanny's brother Ira, aged eight, being no longer a child, of course knew better than to suppose the hand was either human or divine, but only painted wood and iron; and he knew besides, having it on good authority-that of the big boys--if the minister should happen to tell a lie (",to err is human," you know) the waiting board would in- stantly drop on his doomed head, thus putting an end to his false doctrine if not to him. Certainly this was a consumma- tion devoutly to be dreaded; but when the day was hot and the sermon heavy,  young Ira could not but think, wearying of the monotony, if by any chance it should fall, after the crash and tumult was well over, what a convenient um-     150  MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. brella it would make if a boy could only get it for his. However, the sounding- board has not fallen from that day to this, which indicates great truthfulness on the part of Mr. Jackson and his successors. The lieutenant's pew, where Fanny and Ira sat, with Tim and Nancy and the rest, was in one corner of the church; and nat- urally, considering the house was so much of it glass, included one window and part of another. Midway of the long prayer, while every one was or ought to be rev- erently standing with downcast eyes, somebody coughed loudly under one of these windows, and graceless Fanny, peep- ing out, saw crazy Aunt Molly dressed "all in her silks," but with naked feet Graceless Fanny instantly stopped peep- ing, for she knew Aunt Molly wished to be seen. She didn't escape seeing her though, for before the prayer was ended there came a sound of bare feet spatting with unnecessary noise up the broad aisle and across to the " left'nant's" pew, which Aunt Molly entered, in her best black silk, with an air of mock politeness.   MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. 151 When  the prayer was finished, and "Amen" had been loudly responded to about the church by the slamming down of the turned up seats, Aunt Molly ar- ranged carefully the folds of her dress and sat down, thrusting her feet far out into view. She was trying to mortify the lieutenant's family, and take down their pride; so they, understanding her motive, took no notice of her. Presently Ira, who was a little nettled at having to give up his seat for her, tak- ing in its stead a footstool, and who was an expert marksman, had occasion to spit to the left of him, and by pure accident, of course, directly on the bare feet. They disappeared as suddenly as though it had been a discharge of red hot grape, and were afterward invisible. The exercises were long, qnd in Ira's opinion tedious, wherein Fanny joined, for once agreeing with him; tedious in spite of the caraway his mother slyly handed down, and the great red rose he picked to pieces and ate. To be sure it was lively enough while the long line of     152  MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. singers were disposing of "Coronation," and chasing each other through the fugues so popular at that time. But after all, "Old Hundred" was the most acceptable music, for that closed the services, and then there was a chance for the open air and the sights without. Like cattle-shows at the present time, an ordination then was a signal for ginger- bread peddlers and cheap showmen to gath- er together, like vultures around a battle- field. This time the bravest show of all was a monkey, a real live monkey, on exhibition at Esquire Gould's barn, and on the payment of ten cents in hard cur- rency the curious were invited to walk over and take a look at him. "How does it look . Tell us what kind of a critter it is!" said an eager group of boys, of whom Ira was chief, to Davia Brooks, who, having been the happy pos- sessor of ten coppers, had gone in. It looks considerable proper," replied David with oracular clearness. In vain the boys plied him with ques- tions and entreaties; they could get noth-   MR.

When the boys were driven almost to despair by David's obscurity, the showman made a magnificent pro- posal on this wise: If the crowd then and there assembled would contribute the sum of ten dollars he would bring forward the monkey on the Common, and let him, in sight of them all, climb the meeting- house steeple. (Such a steeple! Bunker Hill monument, built long since, is a mere cob-house to it!) Instantly the hat went around, and though a degree of doubt hangs over the amount raised, yet the generous showman brought out his monkey, and if the animal didn't climb the steeple, very likely he would if his string had been long enough. During this time fifty ovens had been giving forth all manner of wholesome, hearty dainties, and pewter plates, as bright as rushes could scour them, were ranged along fifty tables, waiting for the Legends of New England. 10      154  MR. JACKSON'S ORDINATION. hungry guests to come and behold their brightness and their burdens. They did not wait long. In due time every table was surrounded by appreciating admirers, and everybody said the day had gone off well. It was not done, however. There was yet a chattering of young voices; a flut- tering of ribbons and muslins in the low chambers under the fifty roofs; a stir in the kitchen of Gould's tavern, and a light- ing up of the long, narrow hall, for or- dinations (strange inconsistency!) always ended with a ball in the rustic days of our grandfathers.  .    IRA. You may laugh, my little people, But be sure my story's true; For I vow by your church steeple I was once a child like you.-WESTWOOD. ' IRA, did you bite Guy?" Ira hung  down  his head  with an abashed look, for he knew very well that he did bite Guy. To be sure Guy provoked him, and Ira was a very small boy; but it is likely he knew better than to bite after all. Why, you see, Ira's sister Fanny had taken him to Master Brooks's to play a while with Guy. Both host and visitor were not yet past the age of gowns. Being, therefore, not learned in all the proprieties of social life, after Ira had selected, a particular brass handle on the bureau for his, Guy kept trying to get it for his.     156      IRA. Now nations have gone forth to battle on just such provocations, and do you suppose little boys in petticoats are wiser than kings and presidents? So Ira bit Guy's arm. Fanny said " it wasn't very clean either." He bit it until it bled, and Guy cried lustily from the pain. Of course, Master Brooks's wife, being Guy's mother, would blame Ira. Of course he was to blame; and Fanny thought, during the confusion, while Guy was weeping with a loud voice, and Mas- ter Brooks's wife was coming with a look of pity for Guy, and a savage look for his conqueror, it might be well to hurry home with her youthful charge. After this, whenever Cousin Moses came to " the left'nant's" gambrel-roofed house, and took Ira on his knee, he liked to 'say impressively, "Ira, did you bite Guy?" For Master Brooks's wife had told him, to be sure, what a very wicked boy Ira was. He enjoyed the look of blended shame and triumph' that showed in the black eyes, in the bent head, and in the chubby   IRA.       157 fingers that found their way suddenly to the boy's mouth. But Ira outgrew, at last, alike the wrath of Master Brooks's wife and the pleasant raillery of Cousin Moses. He came in time to be old enough to go to school. He was four years old, and in the old-fashioned days when Ira was young four was a mature enough age to sit for six lingering hours on a hard, straight bench, preparing to say the al- phabet after the teacher twice a day. Ira didn't go to school to Master Brooks's, because the gambrel-roofed house was just over the line out of the up- street district; so he went the other way a mile. Not to the new brick school- house, where my sister Ann was that sum- Iuer day when I first came to live under tIe gambrel roof--that wasn't built then -but to the old school-house that used to stand over across the Common, above the brook. Asa said he could knock it off down the bank with a snow-ball, but he never did.     158      IRA. One noon-time Ira happened to be in the store when a man came in and called for some raisins. They were weighed for him, and he took them away without speaking of paying for them. Now Ira had never studied book-keep- ing, and he had no idea of the meaning of debit and credit; so thinks he, " if that is the way you sell your raisins I'll take some," and forthwith stepped up, a little timidly, to ask for half a pound. The merchant, somewhat to his surprise, said nothing, but weighed and gave them to him, and he went off to divide his booty with his young school-fellows. He didn't speak of the trade at home, for he had a sort of undefined feeling of guilt about it. Some time after, when left'nant"' set- tled his account at the store, he was much puzzled by the petty charge of half a pound of raisins, till the merchant mentioned he believed his little boy bought them. Ira was his baby, the child of his old age, and so he escaped without any re- proof. But now he is a man, when his daughters   IRA.      159 bring home a new book and say they had it 'put on the raisin account," a covert smile shows itself on the face that was making ready a look of mild disapproval, and I don't think he got his raisins so very cheap after all. One Sunday, when "the folks" had gone to meeting, leaving only Fanny and Nancy with the care of Ira, the girls had prepared for themselves a nice dish of hash, "and they didn't. spare for the butter," as Fanny says. Just as they were sitting down to enjoy it, who should they see coming but crazy Aunt Molly. So they put the savory viands in a cup- board down cellar, and ran to hide, that Aunt Molly needn't think proper to stay, as she would be sure to if there was any appearance of good cheer. "Now, Ira," said they, " don't you let Aunt Molly go down cellar." I think this must have been before he was old enough to go to school, and buy raisins, perhaps about the time of his warlike visit at Master Brooks's; at any rate, he was sadly deficient in discretion,     160      IRA. for he planted himself at the top of the cellar-stairs when the old woman entered, saying, "Don't you go down cellar, Aunt Molly! don't you go down cellar!" Of course the crafty maniac started that way directly, and then the valiant little sentinel shouted, "Don't you go to the cupboard, Aunt Molly! don't you go to the cupboard!"' Of course she went there at once, and discovering the platter of smoking-hot hash, understood perfectly well why Ira happened to be keeping house all by him- self when she came. So, with crazy glee, she proceeded "to come up with Fan and Nance," by eating their dinner for them. And how her sharp eyes glistened, and how her portly sides shook with laughter to see the look of insulted dig- nity with which young Ira refused a plateful of the hash, while he stood in- dignantly by watching her as she com- placently emptied the platter! The daisies have grown many a year over the wild, wandering feet, till even   IRA.      161 the very grave of Aunt Molly is for- gotten. Master Brooks and his family have long passed from the memory of all but the older people of the town, and live only in tradition. Fanny and Nancy have come to be elderly women in the diverse paths where God has called them to walk, and Cousin Moses was gathered to his fathers, an aged man, before you were even born, young Blue-eyes. So one generation passeth away and another cometh! The house with the gambrel roof long ago gave place to a more spacious modern dwelling, which, in its turn, is growing old-fashioned and time-worn; and there is white hair mingling with the black on Ira's head now, and he wears spectacles when he reads, and has even come to be somebody's grandfather.     MANAGING FANNY. Our Garrick's salad-for in him we'see Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree. GOLDSMTH. IRA was the youngest of eleven chil- dren, and being five years younger than the tenth, and withal a bright, intelligent boy, there was great danger of his being spoiled. It often happens that after a series of births in a family parental government seems to relax, and the older children- brought up by rules as strict as the laws of the Medes and Persians that altered - not-begin to say of the sixth or seventh with a little discontent, "Tommy can do thus and thus; I never was allowed to!" But we generally find in every large family one who is self-appointed, or per- haps it would be more correct to say,   MANAGING FANNY."    163 appointed by Nature as mentor, critic, and reformer, and so it was in the Lieu- tenant's family. Fanny, whose name was recorded on the middle line upon the page of "Births" in the Family Record, and who .had the sharpest nose and chin, and the keenest black eyes of the whole eleven, was the one who looked after the slackening reins of government, and all other family in- terests. "Need enough of it too," she used to say when in her declining years this fact was mentioned in her presence. There was Sally, the eldest; -she had her accomplishments. She was handsome and amiable ;, she could spin and weave, make butter and cheese; she could sing like a lark, and trip along the green like Queen Mab; but she was altogether too easy, really feeble-minded in the way of family supervision, Fanny thought. Nancy, who was number ten in the long line, was too young to exercise authority over any of the boys but Ira; ^and then she had a way, very much ad- /      164   MANAGING FANNY. mired by her brothers, of breaking town into a merry, though inaudible laugh, shaking her little figure, and dimpling her roses whenever she began to scold them. However earnestly she might be- gin, and however richly they deserved the censure, she was never known to proceed far without spoiling it all by this habit of hers. The boys thought it very becom- ing, and she was considered by them exceedingly pretty, her French style of beauty being softened down by eyes like an antelope's; she was. very much beloved by them too; but as all must see, she could not put on the dignity of Zenobia or Victoria, however much it might be needed. Neither, perhaps, could the gypsy-look- ing Fanny; but what she lacked in re- gality of bearing she made up in vigilance and cunning. Fanny was the one to dis- cover that the mad, sly aunt, who resided elsewhere, had filled her basket with the best of the flax out of the Lieutenant's attic, and had hidden it among the tall reeds in the back yard until a safe oppor.   MANAGING FANNY.    165 tunity should occur for its further removal; and she it was, to be sure, who changed the nice flax for the worthless swingling- tow-swindling-tow, Fanny used to pro- nounce it-preserving the most unmoved face in the world, when Aunt Molly, in- stinctively understanding wAo must be the author of what she could not help considering a most capital joke, looked at her curiously from time" to time with mirthful inquiring eyes. Fanny was the one, too, who palmed off the " pea-coffee ' for an honest, genuine beverage. But I must tell you about this at length. There was a large gathering of uncles and aunts under the roof of the Lieutenant. Fanny and her Cousin Nabby prepared the tea. The table was set with the plum- cake and the election-cake, the sage cheese and the quince preserves; the immense pile of griddle-cakes, baked in a spider over the coals, was buttered and sugared and cut through like a pie; the hot short cakes were ready; the tea was drawn and announced, and the guests were     166    MANAGING FANNY. already coming out to partake of the re- freshments, when Fanny, the keen-sighted, suddenly discovered that somebody in the large household having cooked peas, the day before, in the tea-kettle where the' water had been boiled for tea, had been so careless as to put it by without wash- ing, and there it was with its coating of peas, loosened by the water freshly boiled over it, and of this they had made the tea. This use of the tea-kettle will not, per- haps, seem quite so absurd, if we consider the proximity of the date of my story to "war times," and the scarcity of various articles of household use in the "best regulated families." However, there could be no excuse for the neglect to wash the utensil afterward. But there was no time for that now. The bustle of putting by the needle-work and the knitting- work was already over, and Aunt Selina and Aunt Ann, Uncle Seth and Uncle Noah and Uncle John, with all the rest of the uncles and aunts, were on their way to the eating-room, that is, the large clean kitchen with its broad fire-place.   MANAGING FANNY.    167 "Call it pea-coffee,' suggested Nabby in a hasty whisper. It must have been worth somewhat, to one in the secret, to have seen her look of decorous sobriety, becoming one in the presence of respected elders, as Fanny announced she had prepared pea-coffee for supper. And when Aunt Selina and: Aunt Ann, notable housekeepers, praised the flavor of the new beverage, and wlhen the uncles passed their cups to be filled the second and third time, the open and in- nocent countenance which Fanny turned on her Cousin Kabby was something bet- ter to witness than a comedy. Then Fanny got up a reputation as a sort of fortune-teller. There would be dialogues on this wise: "One of our boys will come home in a few days; which do you want it should be, Ira?" The wide-awake, dark eyes would open still wider. "I'd rather it would be Sam." "Well, it wont be the one you want it should be."     168   MANAGING FANNY. "How do you know, then? How do you know George is coming?" "O, don't you know I can tell things that are going to happen?" rejoins Fanny, with a look becoming Minerva's owl. Sure enough, George would come home in a few days. As has been hinted, Fanny took it upon herself to carry out the policy of the wise man when her parents failed therein toward their youngest born. His memory stung for years at the thought of the switches of plantain-rod which were used to enforce obedience on various occasions. But one good deed Fanny did, for which the world is better to-day. There is one less tobacco-chewer in it on her account, and I bless her memory for it! for she prevented her little brother from learning to use the detestable weed, and this was the way she did it. The Lieutenant, as too many men do now-a-days, had learned in his youth, either in the army or at some earlier period, to use tobacco, and little Ira, advanced, per- : *         k'   MANAGING FANNY.    169 haps, to the manly age of ten, thought it was high time for him to take a lesson in the same. So, depositing a small piece of the dark " cut" in his vest pocket, lihe cautiously began. Taking occasionally the least nibble in the world, he felt him- self getting on famously, and began to calculate on the day on 'which he could chew and spit equal to any one of the revolutionary veterans who came of a morning to talk over the short-comings and ill-doings of Tom Jefferson, and drink a mug of cider with his father. He had arrived at this point, I say, when he dis- covered that the lynx-eyed Fanny had detected him in the act of conveying a spicy morsel to his lips. But what was there to blush for in this manly accom- plishment? Always appear bold in an innocent cause-such as the use of tobacco So Ira nibbled, and chewed, and rolled the sweet morsel under his tongue, and spit in his miniature way with the non chalance of any gentleman in car or steam- boat at the present day. Just as he was conveying the lump of which he had so Legends of New Enughld.

Boys, as I have learned, though I never could see the reason why, think they must always do whatever they are " dared" to do; so Ira put the whole piece into his mouth at once and chewed vigorously, just to let her see  Pretty soon he feels himself turn pale, then his head begins to swim; he is grow- ing sick fast; he can hardly see his way; it won't do to stay here; it won't do to let Fan see his manliness evaporate after this sort; he rushes out behind the barn; the cold perspiration beads his forehead. Dear me! I can imagine it from an ex- perience I have had. Have you never- you who never did poison yourself with tobacco-inhaled two gills of concentrated ether at a time? If you have, how did you like the getting over the effects? "The sickness, the nausea, the pitiless pain?" Edgar A. Poe didn't refer to. the effects of ether or tobacco, I fancy, in the poem   MANAGING FANNY.     171 just quoted, nevertheless the lines will apply. Ira had an indescribable time of it, and he never put another jot of tobacco be- tween his lips; and now that his beard is white, and he is in his sixties, he is a staunch anti-tobacco man. Therefore I say the world is better to-day for Fanny 'having lived in it. THE END.  \
