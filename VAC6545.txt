            The Great "Trunk Mystery" of New York City 
             
                
                   
                  
                     moved it out on the platform to have it placed in a baggage car, he noticed a disagreeable odor arising from it. This aroused his suspicions, and he at once informed Mr. Vandeward, the baggage master. That gentleman had the trunk removed to an outer building, and ordered it to be opened. To the indescribable horror of those who witnessed it, the object uncovered proved to be the body of a 
                
                
                  YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. 
                  The body was entirely nude, and had been shockingly distorted in the effort to pack it in so small a space. In the top of the trunk and covering the body were a comforter or heavy bed quilt, a piece of a blanket, a coarse chemise, and two or three other articles of common material. All these things, much soiled, emitted a very offensive odor. 
                  Mr. Vandeward at once gave orders to close the trunk and summon officers Murphy and McCullough of the Twentieth Ward Police, who took charge of it. Captain McCaffrey was at once summoned, and messengers were dispatched in quest of a coroner. 
                  At 9 o'clock Coroner Herrman arrived and gave a permit for the removal of the trunk and its ghastly contents to the Morgue, to await identification and inquest. 
                  The scene at the depot after the discovery was an exciting one. Railway officials rushed up and down in the search for the woman who had brought the trunk, and policemen were active in their efforts to find some clue by which the persons engaged in what now seemed clearly a tragedy might be discovered. But few saw the woman or had their attention particularly called to her or her movements. One or two noticed that she exhibited nervousness when 
                
                
                  HAVING THE TRUNK CHECKED 
                  and this in a marked degree when the baggage-man told her that the lid of the trunk was not secure, and advised her to buy a strap to go around it. Expense did not seem to her any object at all, although she did not appear to be a person likely to incur it heedlessly. This circumstance attracted one or two pairs of eyes to her, but only momentarily. The boy who assisted the carman to carry the trunk into the depot had a clearer recollection of the woman and her movements than any other person who saw her. His story as told to our reporter is as follows: 
                
                
                  THE STORY OF THE BOY. 
                  My name is Alexander Potts; I am twelve years old, and live with my mother at Thirty-seventh street and Eighth avenue. I am around the Hudson River Railroad depot every day, where I sell candy and papers and carry light baggage from the carriages. On Saturday I was standing in front of the depot on Thirtieth street, about one o'clock, when I saw a one-horse cab coming toward the depot from the direction of Ninth avenue. The cab stopped in front of the ladies' entrance to the depot, and I ran and opened the door of the cab, when a lady got out. She wore a common calico dress with a thin alpaca shawl, and had on a small jockey hat without a veil. She wore no waterfall, but her hair was tied up in a small knot behind and enclosed in a net. She seemed to be about eighteen or nineteen years old, and her hands looked like those of a working girl. As she got out of the cab she handed the cabman a one-dollar bill and he drove off. She then turned to me and said, "Sonny, can you tell me where the ticket office is?" I asked her how far she was going, and she said she was 
                
                
                  GOING TO CHICAGO. 
                  I then told her that if she went inside and got her ticket she could then get her baggage checked. She then went with me to the ticket office, and after inquiring the price of a ticket, she handed the ticket clerk two twenty-dollar bills, and he returned her the change, $18, and a ticket. The change he gave her was three five dollar bills, a two-dollar bill, and a one-dollar bill. She then stood talking with the ticket clerk about five minutes, but although I was standing near, I did not hear what was said, because I paid no attention. When she got through talking with the clerk, she turned to me and said that she had not intended to go to Chicago, but had 
                
                
                  CHANGED HER MIND, 
                  guessed she would on account of her baggage. I told her that unless she went her baggage couldn't go. She then asked me what she should do about her baggage, and said it would be there soon on Tripp's express wagon. We then went outside, and while standing in front of the depot she saw a wagon coming down the street from the direction of Ninth avenue. She then turned to me and said, "Here comes my man," and then beckoned with her finger to him as if to hurry him on. When the man with the wagon saw her beckon he seemed to drive faster. She then asked me if I would mind helping him in with the trunk, and said that she would pay me. When the wagon stopped in front of the baggage room, I stepped up to help the man to place the trunk on the sidewalk, but he wouldn't let me, saying he'd handle it himself. He 
                
                
                  LIFTED IT CAREFULLY, 
                  and set it flat on the sidewalk. I then took one handle and he the other and we carried it into the baggage-room. I wanted to set the trunk of its end, as they always do, when the woman and the man both stopped me, saying that the trunk contained glass, and it mustn't be handled roughly. I stepped up to the counter and told Frank, the baggage checker, that the lady wanted to get her baggage checked to Chicago. The truckman and I then took hold of the trunk to place it on the counter, when the lady placed her hands underneath the trunk and assisted us. She said that she would like to have an extra strap around the trunk, and I told Frank what she said. Frank then told her that the strap would cost her $1, and she answered, "I don't care for a dollar if you strap it good." Frank then put the strap around the trunk and drove three nails into it. She then gave Frank her ticket and $1. He punched the ticket and handed it back to the woman with a baggage check. She then turned to the truckman and said: "I'm much obliged to you for your trouble." They then 
                
                
                  SHOOK HANDS, 
                  and the truckman drove off, wishing her good-bye. The woman and I then went into the street, and she handed me five cents. I told her that was not enough, and she gave me five cents more, and asked me to show her a good restaurant where she could get some dinner. I went with her to Keenan's saloon on Ninth avenue, between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth streets. When we got there she would not go in, but said she guessed she would go to her friends, as she didn't have much time and very little money. She then left me and walked down Ninth avenue, and I went back to the depot. 
                
                
                  IN THE MORGUE. 
                  The appearance of the body as it lay in the trunk was frightful. The trunk was but two feet eight inches in length, yet the young woman was over five feet in height, and had been literally crushed into it. Her head was forced over on her breast, and her limbs were drawn up to the very fullest tension of the ligatures in order to crowd the body into the narrowest compass possible. The rags which covered the body had evidently been selected for the purpose because of their worthlessness. Two pillow cases, which were among the number, had pieces torn out of the open ends, evidently to remove the name which had probably been written on them. 
                  Our reporter viewed the remains as they lay in the dead-house at Bellevue. In life the young woman was doubtless very beautiful, although now sadly disfigured by death's terrible follower. She was apparently about twenty years of age, of slight and delicate figure, and as ethereal in form as Guido's Io. A tangled mass of the 
                
                
                  MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR 
                  fell in waves over her shoulders, which must have been as white as Parian marble, and eyes of blue, that even death's horrors cannot pale, look out in all their ghastliness from swollen and discolored lids. The limbs were white and shapely, and the feet tiny and delicate. The arms and hands were faultless in their symmetry, and every feature showed refinement and grace. The small exquisitely cut face was terribly discolored and the mouth distorted by suffering. The teeth regular in
                      
                      
                        Rosenzweig, assisted by the Truckman, removing the trunk containing the body poor Alice Bowlsby. 
                        
                           Rosenzweig, unterstzt von dem Fuhrmann bei Fortschaffung des Koffers, die Leiche der armen Alice Bowlsby enthielt.
                         
                     
                      form and pearly in their whiteness. One of the knees was much bruised, and the skin had been peeled off. This shows what brutality the fiends must have practised in their efforts to force the delicate form into its narrow box. The trunk stood near the box enclosing the remains of the poor girl. In it were the mute witnesses to the terrible deed-the rags which accompanied the body. The trunk is an ordinary old shoe trunk. The hinges are loose, and the lock not secure. The inside of it is discolored with blood, but not a spot appears on the outside. 
                
                
                  THE POST MORTEM EXAMINATION. 
                  Dr. Cushman, Deputy Coroner, went to the Morgue, and made a post mortem examination of the body. He found it, as it lay in the coffin, decently covered with a linen sheet. He says that the girl was about twenty years of age, and had been dead three days. The body Dr. Cushman found very much decomposed: the eyes were swollen and the mouth open. Decomposition had particularly far advanced in the head, neck, and trunk. There were no external marks of violence, but the lower part of the person was very much swollen and bloody. On opening the body the abdominal cavity was found to contain a large amount of fluid, and there were evidences of acute peritonitis. The examination of the womb showed marks of laceration, and there were found evidences of intense inflammation; also of the placenta; a small portion of the placenta still adhered to the posterior surface. All the other organs, the liver, kidney, heart, stomach, etc., were in a perfectly healthy condition. Dr. Cushman thought that death was caused by metroperitonitis-the result of malpractice, or criminal violation of nature's laws in the delivery of the unfortunate girl in childbirth. But up to the time here referred to, mystery had as yet veiled the whole. 
                
                
                  THE PHYSICIANS' THEORIES. 
                  Physicians who examined the position of the body in the trunk were at a loss to understand how it could have been so distorted after death. When rigor mortis exists, the joints become as inflexible as iron bars, and this too five minutes after the breath leaves the body. This gives rise to the dreadful suspicion that the fair young victim was crushed into the trunk while yet alive, and several medical gentlemen give it as their opinion that this was actually the case. The joints were bent naturally, and when relieved from their confinement the limbs remained as they were bent, and it required force to straighten them out. 
                
                
                  THE SEARCH BY THE POLICE. 
                  The police continued indefatigable in their efforts to fathom the mystery. Soon after the discovery, Captain Caffrey informed himself of all the facts that he could get, and then went to the Central Office and conferred with Inspector Walling. The result of the consultation was that the finding of the man who drove the truck should be the objective point. The boy Potts was sent for. He soon arrived at the Central Office in charge of Sergeant James. The boy said he did not notice the number of the truck, but was positive that the name of Tripp was painted on it. One of the cart inspectors and Ward Detective Freeman of the City Hall were then telegraphed for. Detectives Brice and McConnell soon arrive, from the Thirty-seventh Street Station, and after a careful examination of the list of carmen and truckmen, the detectives started off at midnight in search of any truckman who might bear the name of Tripp. At about one o'clock, officers Freeman and Carnoghan found, 231 Bowery, an old German carman, who gave his name as Medert Trapp. Trapp was 
                
                
                  MARCHED IN TRIUMPH 
                  to the Central Office and confronted with Inspector Walling. He admitted that he had been applied to by a stranger to take a trunk for him from a house in Bond street to the depot, but said that he did not take the job. 
                  Inspector Walling winked at Detective Tilly, as much as to say, "We've got the right man sure." Then it was suggested that the boy should see whether he could identify Trapp as the man. Young Potts was then brought in, and without hesitation he declared that Trapp was not the man. Trapp was thereupon allowed to depart. He seemed indignant at his detention, and vowed that he would have satisfaction. 
                  The detectives were then started off with orders to search every part of the city, and not stop until they found Tripp. The search for Tripp was kept up unceasingly until about 8 o'clock on Tuesday morning, but no such man was found. At about 9 o'clock Detectives McConnell and Brice learned that 
                
                
                  A MR. LEE BRADY, OF THIRD AVENUE, 
                  owned a truck which corresponded with the description of that which carried the trunk to the depot, and that he had taken some baggage in it to the depot. The detectives hurried to Brady's house, taking the boy with them. On their arrival the boy failed to identify either Brady or his truck. Brady then told the detectives that a cabman by the name of Francis Cooper had driven a woman to the Hudson River Railroad depot on Saturday. They then ascertained that the cabman could be found at Seldon's livery stables, on Twenty-third street, near Third avenue. Thither the detectives bent their steps, and found Cooper. The boy recognized Cooper. He was the man. Cooper told the detectives that he was just in the act of leaving the stable with the coup when a lady went into the office of the stable and told the clerk, a colored man, that she wanted to be driven to the depot, and inquired the price. When she was told that the price was $1.50, she said that she was poor and could not pay more than $1. The clerk receded from his demand, and the woman entered the cab by herself. Cooper took no particular notice of her, nor did he see her until they arrived at the depot. There the boy opened the door of the coup and she paid him the dollar. He feels convinced, however, that he should know her if he ever saw her again. The police continued persistently in working on other clews as fast as they came up. 
                
             
             
               THE SECOND DAY (MONDAY) AMID THE TRUNK MYSTERIES. 
               Early in the day, by order of Inspector Walling, the boy Alexander Potts was taken in a carriage with officers Carnochan and Freeman, of the Twenty-sixth Precinct, to make a tour of the entire city, visiting every place where trucks stand for hire, with the hope that at some one of these he might identify the man or the vehicle concerned in the affair. Hours passed away, during which nothing was heard from this party, and it was presumed they were constantly engaged in carrying out the instructions they had received. Meantime the curious called in great numbers upon Inspector Walling, who remained at Police Headquarters, anxious to learn the latest developments. For all of these he had but one answer, that he had nothing new; but to the members of the Press he added that when he had the truckman, and that person had given him such information as would lead to the detection of the murderer, and he was so close upon the latter that escape would be impossible, he would give in full all the facts, but until then he should not give any whatever. 
               Not trusting to the inspection by the boy Potts, and anxious not to leave a single chance neglected, Inspector Walling issued orders which practically put every policeman in the force upon the case, and waited impatiently for something to turn up. 
                
                  THE TRUCKMAN FOUND AT LAST. 
                  At 3 o'clock a telegram was received from the Eighteenth Precinct that the truckman had been found, and was then in charge at that station, and in a few minutes Inspector Walling left Headquarters and went to the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, in Twenty-second street, near First avenue. He there found a truckman named William Pickett, who lives at No. 471 First avenue, but who stands for hire at the corner of Third avenue and Twenty-ninth street. With Pickett was Warden Brennan, of Bellevue Hospital, and the statement of the latter has priority in this narrative of the startling events by which the abortionist was tracked to and dragged from his lair. He stated that he had known Pickett intimately for a long time, and that shortly after noon he came to the hospital greatly troubled to seek for advice. He had read the accounts of the mystery in the morning papers, and thought that he was the man who had taken the trunk to the depot. The Warden got Pickett to relate the circumstances, on hearing which he was convinced of the man's identity, and persuaded him to go around to Captain Cameron of the Eighteenth. 
                
                
                  PICKETT'S STORY. 
                  When they arrived there, Pickett told the captain that about 1 o'clock, P. M., on Saturday, a woman came to his stand on the corner of Twenty-ninth street and Third avenue, and asked him to go to the basement of No. 687 Second avenue and get a trunk of hers, which he would obtain by ringing the bell and telling the people what he wanted. Then he was to put it on his truck and bring it to the Hudson River Railroad Depot, whither she was going in a coup. She paid him in advance, changing a five-dollar bill to do so, and they parted. He went to the house, rang the bell, and, the door opening, was ushered into the basement chamber. There was no hall. Here he observed several women and a tall man, whom the carman described so accurately, as to enable Acting Police Sergeant Rooney to identify him as Jacob Rosenzweig, whom he knew well. 
                
                
                  ROSENZWEIG'S ARREST EFFECTED. 
                  Without more ado, Captain Cameron, having ordered Sergeant Rooney to put on citizen's clothes, took the man to No. 687 Second avenue; went down the basement, and applied for admission. The door was opened, but the doctor was out. His wife and daughter only were in. The wife is in a delicate condition, having been confined but four weeks previous. Things looking unsatisfactory, Captain Cameron withdrew, taking care to put the house under strict surveillance, so that nobody could enter or leave without being seen. Sergeant Rooney, in his civilian disguise, watched for the doctor's arrival. He came at last, and was seen to enter a liquor store near his house. Rooney followed, and was about to arrest him, and Rosenzweig made a dash for liberty, because he recognized his captor. He was too late to escape, and fell into the officer's hands easily Seeing that there was a struggle between the men, the police who had been quietly waiting on the other side of the way, dashed across, followed by a number of persons who quickly scented the game, and would have lynched the prisoner, but for the officers, some of whom were compelled to draw their revolvers while Sergeant Rooney got his man into a Second avenue car, and took him in safety to the Eighteenth Precinct. 
                  When Captain Cameron returned with the truckman, earlier in the evening, from their unsuccessful attempt to find the doctor-or man who had given him the trunk-they brought with them to the Station-house the servant girl from No. 687, and a Jew peddler boy, from whom he hoped to obtain some information. 
                
                
                  THE TRUCKMAN MAKES A DETAILED STATEMENT. 
                  Inspector Walling met the party, and immediately made the truckman recount the circumstances of Saturday. He told in addition to the manner of his engagement, as already described, and the delivery of the trunk, that he placed it on his cart and proceeded to the Hudson River Railroad depot, where he found the woman waiting for him, conversing with a boy whom she had engaged to help her with the trunk. He, the truckman, took hold of one end of the box to lift it off the wagon, and the boy attempted to raise the other end, and not being able to do it alone, was assisted by the woman. He and the boy then carried the trunk into the depot and put it on the counter to get it checked. While Frank Dunning, the baggage-master, was thus engaged, a bystander remarked that the lock was very weak. The woman asked for a rope to tie the lid down more firmly. Frank Dunning said he had nothing but a strap. She replied that it would do. "Do you know what it will cost you?" said he. "I don't care," she answered. "It is worth a dollar," the man remarked. She told him to put it on, and paid the money. The truckman then left. 
                  When he heard this story, the Inspector, learning that the boy had arrived, called him in and made him relate his recollection of the facts in the man's presence. The latter, at the conclusion, said that every word was true, except the assertion that he shook hands with the woman when parting. This he strongly denied. Here was the only point of difference between them. 
                
                
                  ROSENZWEIG INTERROGATED. 
                  Rooney brought his prisoner in at this juncture, and the Inspector confronted him with Pickett, and asked him if he knew anything about the trunk which he had given the man on Saturday. Rosenzweig appeared perfectly amazed at the question, and denied having ever before set eyes upon the truckman, and was totally in the dark about the trunk. "What trunk?" said he. Pickett said that he believed Rosenzweig to be the man who had given him the trunk, but he was not sure that he had ever seen the girl before. The wife, he thought, was in the basement at the time of its delivery, and asked him where he was going to take it. However, he was not very clear on these points. The inspector ordered the prisoner to be locked up, and the servant girl, truckman and Jew peddler to be set at liberty. 
                  On further examination it was found that Mrs. Rosenzweig, who at first denied all knowledge of the trunk business, said very innocently that she was too delicate to be down stairs on Saturday when the truckman called, but hastily correcting herself, she again professed total ignorance of any such affair having transpired. Inspector Walling found out afterward that the woman had been down to the basement four or five times since her confinement. Around this female's complicity in this affair, a great deal of doubt and uncertainty exists, and no light at all thus far has been thrown upon the woman who engaged the truck, went to the depot in the coup, and was so diabolically cool in her efforts to have the evidence of the crime removed to a far distant city. She has thus far escaped: but not for long, if the fears of conviction are worth anything to unlock prisoners' lips. 
                
                
                  SEEKING TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM. 
                  Having disposed of these persons, Inspector Walling believing that some clue to the poor victim's identity might still exist in the shape of a valuable trinket or article of wearing apparel, which the oupidity of the wretches into whose merciless hands she fell caused to keep, placed a close guard over the arrested man's premises, and afterward issued an order that they be thoroughly searched. He then returned to Police Headquarters. In brief then, although the task of relating these events has occupied so little space, the unravelling and pursuit of the matter. step by step, had to be carefully managed, not to alarm those whose arrest was desired, and the whole afternoon and evening were consumed in watching and investigating satisfactorily. No sooner had he reached his desk than two persons called upon him in the belief that they had recognized in deceased a friend whose fate and absence from home could not be accounted for. Their testimony was too indistinct and vague to be considered worthy of serious credence especially when heard in connection with that of several others, who came to the Central Office during the early part of the day and claimed the dead girl as their friend. Yet each person was from widely-separated parts of the country and State. Late at night a gentleman waited upon Inspector Walling with a photograph, in the hope that by it some one who had seen the victim might relieve his anxious mind of the fear that she was the original of the carte. He had to leave in a state of uncertainty, as no one felt able to hazard anything like a just opinion. 
                  About 10 o'clock Inspector Jameson, with several other officers, went to the house in Amity place, South Fifth avenue, occupied by the prisoner as an office, to find, if possible, the woman who had sent the trunk to the depot. 
                  Not having any evidence by which to identify the woman, should she be on the premises, considerable caution was at first exercised to prevent alarming the inmates, or making an excitement in the neighborhood. The house was closely watched, and to the officers and the small band of reporters, it was for the time-being an object of intense interest. Several females were sitting on the stoop, apparently unconscious of the espionage on the house. 
                  The rear window of a house on Amity street was taken as a place of observation by some of the reporters, and the movements of those in the house were watched with Argus eyes. A Saratoga trunk was seen on the porch looking out into the garden, that was thought to be one of the trunks used in the business. 
                  The police finally entered the house, and Mrs. Ascher, the woman in charge, who is quite old, denied that the place was as it was represented

                      No proofs being at hand to show that it was, the police were obliged to be satisfied with the statement that it was occupied by respectable people, and that "Dr." Ascher only kept an office there. Subsequently Inspector Walling sent the truckman and boy to Rosenzweig's, alias Ascher's house in Amity place with an officer. They saw all the females in the building, but failed to recognize among them the woman who was at the depot on Saturday. 
                
                
                  SKETCH OF THE PRISONER ROSENZWEIG, ALIAS ASCHER. 
                  
                     A.-Ladies in trouble guaranteed immediate relief, sure and safe; no fees required until perfectly satisfied; elegant rooms and nursing provided. Dr. Ascher, Amity place, etc.
                   
                  This advertisement was clipped from a late issue of the Herald. The following is an accurate description of the man now arrested: 
                  "Dr. Ascher," alias "Rosenzweig," of South Fifth avenue, below Amity street, claims to be a Russian, but his voice has the twang of a German Jew. He is very bulky in figure, about 40 years of age, and is said to know more of saloon business than of medicine. His diploma is said to have cost $40. His house is a large three-story and basement one, and is able to accommodate twelve patients. He does a large business. When called upon he assures applicants, "These other fellows are all humpugsh; they bromish to do something vot they don't do. I poshitively do all operashunsh widout any danger, and as sheap as anybody." The corpse like faces to be seen peering through the bed-room blinds are enough to horrify the stoutest-hearted passers-by. 
                
                
                  THE PROFESSIONAL ABORTIONIST'S BUSINESS VARIETY. 
                  "Dr." Rosenzweig, besides the house in Amity place, of which more hereafter, has another at No. 687 Second avenue, where he resides with his family. How many more of these horrible dens he keeps in other parts of the city may yet be discovered. From this house the body was carried in the trunk to the depot. Those who know Rosenzweig say that about two years ago he kept a lager beer saloon in this city, but probably not finding it as profitable as he desired, he turned his attention to the "practice" of medicine, which in his hands became the practice of murder. Hanging in his "office" is a diploma which he procured to give him a licence to pursue his murderous calling. This diploma was obtained from an "institution" in Philadelphia, with eight principal professors and eight adjuncts. He told an acquaintance that he had paid $40 for that particular diploma, but, said he, I did not need it, for I have got three or four of them. The "Dr." has a wife living, a daughter, fourteen years of age, and a child of about a month old. He is a fat, coarse and sensual-looking fellow, without any traces of refinement in person or manners, and does not bear the faintest appearance of the educated physician. None but the wretched creatures, who, driven to desperation by their condition and the fear of discovery by friends, would place any confidence in his skill. Many of the misguided women that he has treated could not fail to have misgivings when they have placed themselves under his treatment, but probably preferred risking life rather than discovery in what they regarded as a misfortune. One of the friends of this monster is "Dr." Franklin, alias Jacoby. 
                  Ronsenzweig is said to have boasted, some time ago, that he, with "Dr. Franklin, was in partnership in an abortion case. This Jacoby, until three or four years past, kept a barber-shop in Sixth avenue. Each of them, according to Rosenzweig, received an equal share in that transaction, and a gold watch was a part of the spoils. 
                  Another case is related of a woman who was in excellent health when she first went under Rosenzweig's treatment, and after a few weeks of his "practice," she is described as being a piteous spectacle. The flesh hung to her bones, her eyes had lost their lustre, and she became as weak and decrepid as though old age had suddenly laid its hand upon her. She left him a complete wreck, and with her health probably blasted for life. He told a medical acquaintance that he produced a salivation by administering from fifteen to twenty grains of calomel, and said the medical gentleman referred to, "I never use more than two and one-half grains." 
                
             
             
               DEVELOPMENTS OF TUESDAY, THE THIRD DAY. 
               Up to the period here suggested, all but one of the difficulties in the way of solving the bloody mystery had been overcome. That difficulty consisted in the identity of the outraged girl; a world of speculations were indulged in, identifying her with really innocent and living parties. By this reckless and merely sensational speculation much injustice was done, and we therefore suppress all reference to names thus wrongly published. Thus far (Tuesday) the body remained unidentified. In order, however, that no chance for identification might be lost, the body was placed upon ice, where it was continued for several days after. 
               Although the condition of the body had been fully published, and the stench, even outside the room where it was exposed in the dead-house of Bellevue Hospital, was almost unendurable, hundreds were drawn on Tuesday by a prurient curiosity to look upon the horrible mass. All of these made the pretence of desiring to see if they could identify the remains, but very few claimed to have friends or relatives missing, and none of these few saw anything that they could recognize. Warden Brennan who still seemed, to put faith in the Kelly story, thought it might be possible to recognize the body from the hair, the ears, and the forehead, which remained intact, and therefore permitted every one desiring to see the body to enter the room where it was exposed. The same was allowed on Wednesday, although decomposition was rapidly progressing, and the remains were becoming dangerous to the health of the hospital and vicinity. 
                
                   
                  JUSTICE ON THE TRACK OF HER OWN 
                  While the hope of ever identifying the murdered woman was almost dying out during Tuesday, that of bringing the murderer to justice was greatly strengthened. By order of Inspector Walling, Captain Cameron sent Sergeant Randall to the house of Rosenzweig early in the day to make a thorough search of the premises. It is a three-story and basement brick house, with a white marble stoop, and is one of two standing upon one lot. This makes it very narrow and causes the street doors to open directly into the rooms on the first floor and basement instead of into halls, as in full width houses. There are but two rooms on each floor making eight in all, and none of them are of large size. The house is furnished comfortably, and even handsomely throughout, showing that the infamous practices of Rosenzweig yielded him an income sufficient to supply him with all the comforts of life. Sergeant Randall going to this house, which has been in constant possession of the police ever since it was pointed out by Pickett, made a systematic and thorough search of it with some important results. In the upper rooms nothing suspicious was found, nor was there any evidence anywhere that the house or any part of it had ever been used as a lying-in hospital. But in one of the drawers of the desk used by Rosenzweig were a number of papers, and in the cellar a most important discovery was made. In one corner under a pile of rubbish were found some bloody rags, portions of an old petticoat and the half of a chemise. This last was seized as a most valuable atom of evidence. It was of fine quality, and a determined effort had been made to destroy both its identity and the blood stains upon it. The latter had been attempted by partial washing with the usual result of spreading the stains evenly through the fabric, and the destruction of the identity had been sought by tearing the chemise into parts, only one of which had been left in this spot. This portion had been torn from the yoke, and had one of the arm-holes, but the sleeve had been wrenched out, as the ragged edges plainly showed, with sudden violence. With the bloody rags and petticoat, the chemise was wrapped up and taken to the station-house. 
                
                
                  A CRIMINAL ESTABLISHMENT AND ITS BRANCHES. 
                  Nor did this bundle contain all the evidence carried away from the house. Among the papers in the drawer was a scrap on which was written, "Ladies cured with or without medicine, by Dr. Ascher, Amity Place," thus conclusively proving the identity of Rosenzweig with the remorseless abortionist exposed lately in the press. There was a certificate of death in the case of a still-born child, filled up on the regular blanks of the Board of Health, signed Dr. Rosenzweig, No. 15 Orchard street, and dated August 11, 1867, thus showing that he had pretended to practice medicine four years ago at least. There were receipts for rent, showing that he has rarely remained long in one place, and that he has lived or had an office at No. 105 First avenue, No. 33 Wooster street, No. 138 East Broadway, No. 5 Essex street, No. 79 Grand street, and at No. 15 Orchard street, as above stated. There were a dozen scraps of paper, on which were scrawled, scarcely legible, names and location which seemed to be memoranda of appointments in the practice of the pretender, and of no bearing upon the case. They were retained, however, and with the more valuable articles which had been secured, taken to the station-house. Before leaving the premises of Rosenzweig, Sergeant Randall made a discovery that for a time seemed to promise important results. This was in the fact, that in the cellar wall between his house and that next door, occupied by Dr. Sutlinski, there was a door, which was, how ever, closed, and fastened on the side of Dr. Sutlinski. The fact was, how ever, noted and reported to Inspector Walling. 
                
                
                  EVIDENCE OF AN UNDERTAKER. 
                  While this search was being made, another and far more important link in the chain of circumstantial evidence against Rosenzweig was found James F. Boyle, an undertaker at No. 658 Second avenue, which is only a few doors from the residence of Rosenzweig, called at the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, and asked to see the prisoner, as he thought he could throw some light upon the case. He was taken out to the prison by Captain Cameron, and Rosenzweig having been called to the door of his cell, Boyle looked at him steadily for a moment and then said, "Yes, that's the man." His statement was then taken down by Captain Cameron, and is as follows: 
                  On the morning of Saturday, the 26th inst., a man whom I recognize as Dr. Rosenzweig came to my store where I do business as an undertaker and asked me how much it would cost to bury a woman, and then added that a servant girl of his had died; that she was very poor and only had $10, and that it did not matter to him how or when she was buried, so that it was done. I asked him what sort of a funeral he wanted. He said he only wanted a hearse. He then asked if I could take the body to the store, saying that it was not far off. I replied that I could only do this if he would furnish me with a certificate from the doctor who had attended her, and then I could get a permit from the Board of Health on further conversation, he said that the doctor who attended the deceased lived down town. He then went away. 
                  In the afternoon the father of Boyle, who was present at the interview, called at the station-house and also recognized the prisoner as the man who had called. 
                
                
                  THE FELON'S CONFESSION. 
                  Rosenzweig at last made his first confession, and without being asked to say anything on the subject, he astonished every one present by saying, in a quivering voice: "Yes, I wash dar, but I must makes fun." Having thus, in police parlance, "given himself away," the grim countenance of Captain Cameron was lighted with a smile as he locked the door on his prisoner, and said, "I wonder if the fool knew what he was saying." 
                  The next step in the case was to exhaust the possibility of the door in the cellar, and, by order of Inspector Walling, a visit was made late in the day by Captain Cameron and Sergeant Randall to the house of Dr. Sutlinski, and thoroughly searched it. There was nothing found, how ever, to sustain the suspicion that there might be a connection between the two houses and the two doctors. Dr. Sutlinski was found to be, so far as the police could judge from appearances, a regular practitioner, and there was nothing irregular whatever about his house. There were several other failures during the day, among which was the arrest of two women suspected of hiring the truckman, but upon the truckman Pickett and the boy Potts being taken to the Sixth Precinct Station-house and confronted with the women, they declared without the least hesitation that neither bore any resemblance to the woman. Inspector Walling has as yet no clue to this woman, and has now but little hope that she will be found, but he considers that he has the principal in the case, and that he has evidence enough to convict him without the testimony of the woman who was an accessory to the crime. Enough has been done to thoroughly frighten the entire community of abortionists, and some of the most prominent of them seem to have fled from the city. Among these is Madame Van Buskirk, whose house at No. 8 St. Mark's place, was last Tuesday night for the first time entirely deserted. 
                  The case is now ready for the final action of the coroner and district-attorney. Inspector Walling believes that all the evidence which it is possible to obtain is now in hand, and that it is sufficient to send Rosenzweig to Sing Sing. There are, of course, thousands of rumors floating about the case, as there always are in such affairs, and as many crude theories of amateur detectives as to the identity of the murdered woman, but they are unworthy of mention. The prisoner, who Tuesday night was furnished with a comfortable bed of blankets and pillows sent from his house, of course stoutly denied all knowledge of the crime, and his servant, Jane Thompson, who was up to this time still detained at the station-house, continued to profess entire ignorance of the affair. But with these denials, and with the identity of the girl yet unknown, the case is complete 
                
                
                  A REPORTER'S MARVELLOUS STORY ABOUT DR. ASCHER, ALIAS ROSENZWEIG 
                  During the month of July last I was directed by the Times editor to investigate thoroughly the entire business carried on so extensively in this city by professional abortionists. In order to secure success, and to avoid suspicion, I was instructed to take a lady with me. After a long, tedious, and in many respects an unpleasant experience, we unearthed a mass of evidence that, if available in a court of law, would drive a score of villains to the refuge of the State prison. 
                  Among others upon whom we called was "Dr. Ascher." at his office in South Fifth avenue, as advertised daily in the Herald for months previously. We rang the bell and were promptly ushered into the hall-way of an ordinary first-class house of the former period. It was of the kind of dwellings that would have been aristocratic ten years ago. A woman of, say, forty years of age opened the door and led us into the parlor As we entered the room a young girl emerged therefrom. She seemed to be about twenty years of age, a little more than five feet in height, of slender build, having blue eyes, and a clear, alabaster complexion. Long blonde curls, tinted with gold, drooped upon her shoulders, and her face wore an expression of embarrassment at the presence of strangers. She retreated to the end of the hall, and stood there for a moment, and then went to another part of the house. In a few moments the doctor made his appearance. 
                  "Do you wish to see me?" he asked. 
                  "Yes, sir. We have come to consult you professionally." 
                  The room in which we were seated was nicely furnished. A fine tapestry carpet covered the floor; at the window was an elegant mahogany desk, against the wall was a long, easy sofa, in the centre of the room was a marble-top table covered with books and pamphlets, and chairs were placed about in the usual manner. Folding-doors seemed to separate the rooms, and adjacent thereto was what seemed to be a piano, having a large cover of heavy damask. The man laid down the pipe from his mouth, for he had been smoking, and wheeling and easy chair in front of us, at once began the conversation. 
                
                
                  INTERVIEW DIRECT. 
                  "I suppose you called for medical services?" he asked. 
                  "We called for medical information," was the answer. 
                  "Exactly; we probably understand each other. You wish to release a lady from difficulty." 
                  "We came to inquire what you propose to do, and what your charges are for such work." 
                  "Well, what are the symptoms-tell me exactly." 
                  "We tell you nothing; but suppose that a lady is --, and that -- are the symptoms. What can you do?" 
                  "Well, you wish to save her and her family. I can do it without danger. I will not fool you. You know what risk there is in this business.I want $200 down. If there is no trouble, I will see the lady safely through for that sum." 
                  "But the result-what is to be done with that? Are we responsible?" 
                  "No, I will take care of the 'result'" (with a significant look and motion of the hand to the lips). "You need not trouble yourself bout that 
                   
                   
                  
                      
                        The "unknown woman" and the MYSTERIOUS TRUNK at the Depot. 
                        
                           Die "unbekannte Frau" und der geheimnivolle Koffer auf dem Bahnhofe.
                         
                     
                   
                   
                  "But-a young lady and gentleman-what can they do to save their reputation?" 
                  [Sotto voce.] "I will give you marriage or burial certificates. I have facilities for both. Is this the lady?" 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Well, I must see the lady," he said, and bowed us out. 
                  Next week I called alone. He was again beclouded in smoke. 
                  "Well, sir," he began, "you have not brought the lady?" 
                  "No: I have not." 
                  "I cannot tell you anything without I see her." 
                  "You told me you could attend to any case; in the far West, for instance." 
                  "But I must know the person and her peculiarities." 
                  "I want to know just what you could do in a certain case. Suppose it to be this--" 
                  [Here an imaginary case was put.] 
                  "Well, that is serious, too. I have had lots of them. I can do the worst safely. If the first means fail I must go to the extreme." 
                  "Dare you use instruments, and is it safe?" 
                  "I do nothing but what is safe. I can do more than all these humbugs that pretend, yet cheat." 
                  "But in case of the child's death, who is responsible in the eye of the law if a discovery is made?" 
                  "Don't worry about that, my dear sir. I will take care of the result. A newspaper bundle, a basket, a pail, a resort to the sewer or the river at night. Who is the wiser?" 
                  "But, doctor, if the mother dies?" 
                  "If that should happen, of course you would stand the expense. But you need never fear. The lady can be disposed of without trouble. I can get marriage or burial certificates without trouble. You know Madame Restell and all the others. I have the same facilities they have. We can do the thing up handsomely, and I can save you lots of expense. All these other fellows are humbugs. But, why did you not bring the lady here?" he asked, with an evident suspicion of the visitor, and then turning the key in the lock and leaning his ponderous form against the door, he seemed to forbid our egress from the place. 
                  "You seem to hang off," he continued. "What do you mean?" 
                  "I don't bring you a case. I ask what would you do under the circumstances I have named?" 
                  "You are a -- sneak and a liar!" he exclaimed, with flashing eyes and an excited manner. "You are a -- spy. I will split your head for you, you-you -- -- --!" 
                  The piano, or table, stood between me and the only means of exit, which his bulky form covered. The blinds, too, seemed to be fastened. He was a muscular man, at least three times the weight of myself, and appeared wrought up to the highest pitch of excitement. 
                  "Let me see, sir," I exclaimed. 
                  "You --, I'll kill you--(advancing), I'll give you all you want; you spy, you devil, you villain!" 
                  Matters seemed desperate. I had not expected such a denouement. But I felt that there was but one thing to do-either to be conquered or to conquer, and leave the house I must, or else suffer violence at his hands. 
                  Perceiving his desperation, I was at once upon my guard. A sudden movement of his hand to his breast pocket, startled me into the belief that he was about to draw forth a deadly weapon and possibly take my life as he had threatened. In an instant I drew a revolver, the sight of which intimidated him, and in his moment of terror and confusion I escaped. 
                  "I will have you arrested," he screamed, as I slammed the door shut and hurried to the street. As I passed through the hall-way I saw the same girl who left the parlor when I made my first visit to the house. She was standing on the stairs, and it was the same face I saw afterward at the Morgue. I positively identify the features of the dead woman as those of the blonde beauty before described, and will testify to the fact, if called upon to do so, before a legal tribunal. 
                
                
                  AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVIDENCE. 
                  Late Tuesday night, the servant of Rosenzweig, Jane Thompson, spoke to what may prove good purpose in a conversation with Warden Brennan, to whom she said that she had determined to tell everything she knew. With this preface, she again declared that she knew nothing whatever of the corpse in the trunk, that no one had died in the house within the past few days, and that she did not know of the trunk being in the house. She then made the important admission, that on the 7th of June a young woman died in the house just after her confinement, and was buried under the name of Mary Carrol, which was not her true name. The certificate gave dropsy as the cause of death, but the servant knew nothing as to what was the real cause. Thomas Carey, undertaker, No 401 Third avenue, had buried the woman, and after the funeral the servant and Mrs. Rosenzweig had taken the child, which, of course, had been born alive, to the Sisters of Charity at the Foundling Hospital and left it there. Inspector Walling was determined to get at the whole truth of this matter, as it is apparent only a part had been told. 
                
                
                  STARTLING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES-THE MURDERED GIRL'S IDENTITY ESTABLISHED. 
                  At 7 o'clock Wednesday evening Warden Brennan reached Police Headquarters in great haste, and inquired for Inspector Walling. That officer was absent, as was supposed, at supper, but in fact had gone to the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house with a man who knew Ascher intimately, and by whom it was desired to identify him as the same person as the prisoner. Warden Brennan intimated that there had been important developments in the case, but he declined to state what they were until he had officially reported them to Inspector Walling. He, herefore, went at once with the three gentlemen who had accompanied him to the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, where a long private consultation ensued between him, his companions and the Inspector. At it conclusion the three gentlemen went away, and some time afterward Inspector Walling stated that he was ready to give the important information that the body had been fully identified as that of the lady mentioned. He then read an official statement, made to him in writing, by Warden Brennan, saying that Dr. Theodore G. Kinne, of 162 Main street, Paterson, and Dr. Joseph F. Parker, a dentist, having his office in the same building, had identified the body. Having stated in brief terms the means of identification, he concluded with returning his thanks to the physician and dentist for the invaluable aid they had rendered in reaching this vital consummation in the case. 
                
                
                  THE EVIDENCE IN DETAIL. 
                  The facts connected with the identification are, however, entitled to be told in more detail than in the concise official statement of Warden Brennan. It appears that three days before, Dr. Kinne visited the dead-house, and, after attentively examining the remains, sought Warden Brennan in his private office, and told him that he thought he knew the identity of the deceased. The Warden had been told the same thing dozens of times before by all sorts of people, and paid at first no more attention to this statement than he had to the scores of others of like character which he had heard. In his incisive hasty way, he asked his visitor how he knew the identity. Dr. Kinne said briefly and calmly that he recognised a scar on the left arm, below the elbow, where he had vaccinated deceased. This was something more than the wild stories he had heard, and Brennan listened more attentively. He knew there was nothing more unusual than vaccination below the elbow, and that such a scar identified by the physician who had caused it was most important. But he was most anxious to have something more definite, and asked Dr. Kinne if he could not bring something more positive. Dr. Kinne reflected for a moment, and then saying decisively that he could, went away. It does not appear that anything more was heard of him until last Wednesday afternoon, and the hope raised by his first visit had nearly expired, when he returned with Dr. Parker, and both gentlemen desired an opportunity to make the fullest examination of the corpse possible under the circumstances. 
                
                
                   
                  THE DEAD GIRL'S PHYSICIAN AND DENTIST. 
                  Dr. Parker, before going to the dead-house, minutely described the work he had done in the mouth of Miss Bowlsby, which consisted in the extraction of one of the molars and the filling of two of the upper teeth, and stated that there was a scar on one of the jaws from an ulcerated tooth for which he had been consulted. The gentlemen then went to the dead-house with Warden Brennan, and the latter proceeded to get the body after it had been taken from the coffin, in a fit condition to handle, by drenching it with water from a hose. After this had been done, Dr. Parker made a thorough examination of the teeth, mouth and jaw of the deceased, and concluded by declaring his readiness to swear to the identity of the body as that of Miss Bowlsby. He recognized his work beyond the possibility of a mistake, and this ended the vexed question of identity. In addition, the gentlemen gave Warden Brennan details of the movements of the lady during the latter part of her life, and some facts which the Warden promised not to divulge, and he has kept his word. All that he was at liberty to say was, that Miss Bowlsby left the home of her aunt in Newark, to go to New York by the 9.15 A. M. train, on Wednesday last, saying she was going to her home in Paterson, and that since that time she has not been seen alive by any of her friends 
                
                
                  THE HANDKERCHIEF! AY, THE HANDKERCHIEF OF THE GIRL-VICTIM! 
                  But Inspector Walling, having at last a name for the victim, again ordered a search of the house of Rosenzweig, with the hope of finding somewhere about it some article of clothing belonging to her. If any such thing had been left about the premises it was certain that it was there yet, as a guard had been constantly on the house, and no one except the officers permitted to leave it since the arrest. By order of the inspector, Captain Cameron, with two of his sergeants, went to the house and searched it thoroughly from top to bottom, but no article belonging to the victim was found anywhere until they came to the kitchen. In the wash-tubs were the clothes which the girl, Jane Johnson, was engaged in washing, when she was arrested two days before. Picking these out, one by one, and examining them attentively, Captain Cameron came finally to a linen hem-stitched handkerchief, such as are usually carried by ladies Holding it up to the gas-light, in one corner there seemed to be letters, but so faint, that they were not distinguishable. The searching was continued until the entire house was exhausted, but nothing further was found, and Captain Cameron returned to the station-house, where the handkerchief was delivered to Inspector Walling. That officer placed the letters upon the handkerchief under a magnifying glass, and there in distinct characters, sentencing the monster Rosenzweig to the full penalty of his crime, were the letters, A. A. Bowlsby. 
                  But this decisive culmination had been reached only after a day of great labor upon the part of Inspector Walling and his able corps of assistants, and the previous history of the day must now be given. 
                
                
                  POLICE OPERATIONS. 
                  The work of tracing out the slender lines of evidence leading in every direction from the case, as it stood in the hands of the police authorities on Wednesday morning, was resumed with vigor. The house No. 687 was kept under surveillance, as heretofore, and everything in the Eighteenth Precinct Station stood just where the reports had left it the right before. 
                  The prisoner had passed a bad night, and was very dejected in the morning. His air of injured innocence and outraged professional dignity had given place to the anxious, care-worn bearing of a man in serious difficulty. In this condition he was found by his wife, who called upon him early. She had overcome the struggles and outward semblance of fear, which had been so markedly visible from the time her husband was arrested. Wednesday she looked nothing worse than annoyed, or, as Sergeant Rooney graphically defined it, "as if she were used to difficult situations." She did not remain very long; but took care to express a wish that she might be relieved of the disagreeable presence of the officer stationed at her house all the time. However, her request could not be granted very consistently with the purposes of justice; but she was permitted to remove, with her two children, to her mother's residence, No. 98 Bayard street. In a conversation she had with Captain Cameron, she told him that although her husband had a diploma from a Philadelphia college, she never knew of his having resided or even lived there for a brief period. 
                
                
                  CAMERON'S SECOND RAID. 
                  After her departure, the chief of the "Eighteenth," aided by a few reporters, systematically began to ransack Rosenzweig's desks and chest of drawers. Every nook and cranny was searched, with very good results. Numerous documents were found, tied up, and brought to the station-house for examination. They were spread out on the table in the back room, and separated. They were nineteen letters altogether, which were unintelligible to the examiners, because written in Polish, Russian and German, in execrable chirography. There were, also, one or two in Hebrew, which were as little understood. Cards of Rosenzweig's, bearing the addresses of some of his other offices, such as Nos. 5 and 2 Essex street, and the names of patients, and the hours at which they should call were in the pile, and many of the envelopes were directed to "Dr. Rosenzweig, of Nos. 114 Thompson, 304 Grand, 311 Fourth, and 138 East Broadway, and 203 North Sixth street, Williamsburg. Besides these were a number of papers of little value, except to prove his identity. Abortionist's instruments, evidently much used were discovered, as also a number of blank certificates of the cause of death, and certificates of stillbirth, such as are furnished by the Board of Health to practitioners of respectable standing. Among the others was a Central Express envelope, bearing the indorsement that John W. Thompson, of Pottsville, Pa., had transmitted $40 to Dr. J. Rosenzweig, for services rendered. A bill of dues from Mordecai U. O. B. B. Lodge, No. 57, showed him to have been a member. Here was another paper:

                              This is to certify that I am acquainted with Dr. Rosenzweig, No. 15 Orchard street, different years; that I had often consultations with him by sick people, and that I found Dr. Rosenzweig a practical man in medical knowledge.

                                    No. 157 Henry street. 
                                 
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  The following slips were likewise brought to light: A letter from Dr. E. Harris, of the Board of Health, dated September 5th, 1866, asking for a full return of the death of David Harris, and addressed to Dr. Roseman; a bill to Dr. Schinkowitz, for the use of a horse; an introduction from Dr. Kokensburger, of No. 68 West Thirty-ninth street; a passport from Warsaw, dated November 21st, 1864; several addresses of John Gray, undertaker, of No. 549 Grand street; and a policy of the Brooklyn Fire Insurance Company on No. 5 Essex street, for $2000, and afterward transferred to No. 53 Wooster and No. 15 Orchard streets. There was an old copy of a diploma, similarly worded to that heretofore noticed. It was made in a large school-boy hand, and been corrected here and there. The question arose as to which of the copies had been first made; the parchment-framed one, or the school-boy's. Is the first a forgery? 
                
                
                  A LIST OF DRUGS. 
                  Now we come to the curiosities. Among the many papers found there was none that gave rise to so much speculation as a large white sheet of foolscap, on which were inscribed a list of "recipes," in cramped penciling, evidently extracts from some evil monitor's fertile brain, or a medical work of practice. They were numbered and catalogued as used for Mrs. Clark and Miss Cottek, who had been either patients or midwives. The principal ingredients were nux vomica, iodine, calomel, opium, belladonna, laurel-water aqua phageda, aqua satur, emil canab, sulphuric acid, Fowler's solutions, and hyd. mur. cor. These may be taken as specimens of the prescriptions, they were the most legible: 
                  
                     1st. Unguentum kail, 4 scruples extr. opii and belladonna, equal ten grains: 2d Aqua saturnalia, 8 drachms; extr. opii, 1 oz; No. 3. Aqua phageda niger, 5 scruples
                   
                
                
                  MAKING A GOOD RECORD. 
                  The following affidavit speaks for itself:

                  LEAF FROM ROSENZWEIG'S DIARY. 
                  In an old diary of the doctor's were found the names of a number of patients whom he had formally attended: Mrs. Johanna Piccon, No. 13 Bayard street, New York; Mr. Grynberg, No. 74 Warren street, near Chambers; Mrs. Workman, No. 28 Chrystie street; Mrs Bernstein, of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., with directions in Polish, written after name; Mrs. Smith, Seventh avenue, corner Forty-ninth street; Mrs. Caufman, No. 203 Division, near Clinton street; Mrs. Samuel Harris, Nashville, Tenn. Then followed a number of receipts for money from gentlemen who payed for the relief extended to patients. Mr. Levy, No. 224 Greene street, $20, dated 1st January, 1866; Mr. Peck, No. 75 Hester street, $25; Mr. Samue, No. 183 Clinton street, $20; Mr. Fischer, No. 41 Walker street, $15. Here again we append the names and addresses of more female patients; Mrs. Harper, No. 31 Chrystie street, May 1st, 1866; Mrs. Thon, No. 135 Sixth street; Mrs. Dayment, No. 144 Seventh avenue, corner Twentieth street; Mrs. Jacobson, No. 411 Houston street, store; another name, whether of male or female, it is difficult to state; S. Ascher, No. 44 Allen street; and the names of the families followed; Mrs. Graham, No. 213 Seventeenth street, Avenue A and First avenue; Mrs. Morris, who appears in three different places as a patient; in one, she requests the "doctor" to call at No. 115 Chatham street, second floor; afterward, at No. 62 Orchard street, and No. 43 Norfolk street. 
                
                
                  THE DAY IN THE STATION-HOUSE. 
                  Although Dr. Rosenzweig must have many acquaintances in this city, Scarcely any paid him a visit of condolence last Wednesday. A few did call, but it would have been better for Dr. Rosenzweig, alias Ascher, if they had never taken it into their heads to see him at all. One person, a gentleman whose name was not ascertained, recognized in him a person whom he had engaged to attend his wife, then suffering from a feminine disorder. He almost killed the woman through ignorance, and was kicked down stairs and outdoors for his rascally assurance. Another person, a Jew, who had known the man formerly, waited on him in the hope of eliciting something like the truth; but he was greeted with doleful looks and flat denial. "These people," said Ascher, in whining tones, "know I am a Jew, and believe me to be rich, and want to extract it from me by prosecution. That is why I have been seized and incarcerated. I assure you, sir, I never met or saw the truckman in my life before. I am, in fact, perfectly innocent." His only other visitor was his counsel who administered what consolation he could. It was a dismal day for the wretched man, who sat in his cell listening to the pelting rain with a countenance as dark as the lowering heavens without. He was miserable and very nervous. Not so Jane Johnson, the servant girl, with whom our reporter had a very interesting conversation. She roamed about the station-house, and conversed freely, feeling no alarm at her position. 
                
                
                  WAS JANE JOHNSON A PATIENT? 
                  The servant girl is apparently about twenty-seven years old. She is a brunette, and rather good looking. She entered the back room while the reporters were examing the captive, when going to the cooler, she took a drink of water. At this point a reporter called her and told her to sit down beside him. She did so, and fixing her black eyes steadily upon him, waited. 
                  Reporter.-Are you sure you told all you could remember of the transition in Rosenzweig's house to Mr. Brennan? 
                  Jane.-I am, sir; perfectly sure. 
                  Reporter.-How long have you been there? 
                  Jane.-A little over three months. 
                  Reporter.-Where is your husband? 
                  Jane.-Dead. 
                  Reporter.-How long, Jane? 
                  Jane (with downcast eyes).-Over six years. 
                  Reporter.-Where did you live before you came to the doctor's? 
                  Jane.-Out West. 
                  Reporter.-What part of the West? 
                  Jane (breaking down).-Oh! I would rather die than tell you, for, did you know it, the newspapers would have the whole story of my shame, and my brother and son would both hear of it. No! No! I would kill myself rather than tell you. 
                  Reporter.-Well, well, I won't press you. But surely you can say when and why you left them? 
                  Jane.-I got into my present trouble about eight months ago, and when I could no longer keep it a secret, I resolved to come to New York until all was over. My folks did not know of my coming, nor did they hear from me since I came. 
                  Reporter.-How did you learn of Dr. Rosenzweig's existence, and how did you come to enter his house? 
                   
                  Jane (embarrassed).-Oh! I heard-that is-I-ah-Mrs. Rosenzweig and I were acquainted before I came to this city 
                  Reporter.-For how long? 
                  Jane (confusedly).-A month or two. 
                  Reporter.-Had you met her anywhere? 
                  Jane.-Oh, no, sir. I heard from-of her. 
                  Reporter.-And came to New York to meet her, eh? 
                  Jane.-No. 
                  Reporter.-Where were you hired as Mrs. R's servant? 
                  Jane.-At her house, of course. 
                  Reporter.-Who brought you there? 
                  Jane.-I went myself. 
                  Reporter.-Why to her? 
                  Jane.-Because I wanted to live in a doctor's house until my trouble was over. 
                  Reporter.-Wanted to get rid of it? 
                  Jane (indignantly).-No, I didn't want to get rid of it; I only wished to be with somebody who could take care of me while I was in a dangerous condition. 
                  Reporter.-Then you took service with this man because you desired his help? 
                  Jane.-Not help, care. 
                  Reporter.-Oh! I see. He was good to have hired a person in your condition, care for her, and give her wages too. Don't you think so? 
                  Jane-It's the truth, if I was to die this minute. 
                  Reporter.-Well to go back: where were you when the carman got the trunk from the doctor on Saturday? 
                  Jane.-He got no trunk from the doctor. 
                  Reporter.-How do you know? 
                  Jane.-Because he was out all day. 
                  Reporter.-And Mrs. Rosenzweig? 
                  Jane.-She was not well. 
                  Reporter.-Had she been confined lately? 
                  Jane.-I believe so. 
                  Reporter.-When was she out of doors first after that event? 
                  Jane.-Oh! three or four times. During the week before Saturday she went out for a walk. 
                  The remainder of the conversation would be uninteresting to the reader. Suffice it to say that the girl, after crying a good deal, "weakened some what," to use a police term, and acknowledged, in addition to the foregoing that "the trunk might have been taken out," but she would not say positively that it had; she never had observed anything wrong in the establishment and never knew of any blonde having been there as a patient. The result of this interview might have been summed up in a few words. Jane Johnson was a country girl, who, having been seduced, left her brother who, she says, is worth some money, and came to New York, and to Rosenzweig's to destroy the evidence of her folly. The manner of doing so can only be inferred. Also she confessed that Mrs. Rosenzweig had been out much before the time she confessed to the authorities she had, and then, despite her point-blank assertions in the negative heretofore, she admits that a trunk may have been given to a carman on Saturday. It is probable that Rosenzweig will be in Sing Sing Prison ere many suns roll round, beginning the fullest term of service allotted by the law to his crime, which is manslaughter in the second degree under the law. There are several minor points yet to be solved, but the case is now complete in legal proof, and Inspector Walling does not consider it necessary to make any further effort. 
                
                
                  FINAL DISAPPEARANCE OF MISS ALICE BOWLSBY FROM HER NEWARK FRIENDS. 
                  On Monday Miss Bowlsby was reported at Police Headquarters to have disappeared from the house of her aunt in Newark the Wednesday before. No special importance, however, was at first attached to this circumstance in connection with the trunk mystery, and beyond the taking of an accurate description of the girl at the time of her disappearance, as is done in the cases of all missing persons who are reported at headquarters, no attention was paid to the matter. But on the following Thursday, this description of the girl as she left the residence of her aunt, Mrs. Harriet L. Williams, No. 80 Belmont avenue, Newark, had not only a sad interest, but in some of its parts is vitally important to the ends of justice. 
                  She was a young girl whose life had apparently never been darkened, and upon whom the breath of suspicion had never fallen. Moving in respectable society, and having relatives in the highest circles, she was everywhere received as an ornament and a delight. Having a most amiable character, elegant in her manners, possessed of vivacity and good conversational powers, she was a favorite everywhere and especially among her male friends. Her rare beauty surrounded her with many devoted admirers. Her rarely regular features, clear complexion, blue eyes, profusion of light auburn hair, little figure and graceful carriage, made her marked among women for her personal attractions. When she left the home of Mrs. Williams on Wednesday these charms were heightened by the simple elegance of her costume. She had on a white lawn dress, tucked and ruffled, a blue sash and ribbon around the waist, a white straw hat trimmed with blue ribbons and flowers, a light shawl striped brown and red, a brown parasol, a black satchel or hand bag, such as ladies usually carry. She wore also a gold chain and locket, the latter containing a miniature of her mother, and she had in her pocket a portmonnaie, in which were several visiting cards. Saying to Mrs. Williams and her mother, who was also visiting that lady, that she was going home to Paterson by the way of New York she gayly tripped away, waving her adieu with her handkerchief which was to be the chief means of fastening the clutches of the law upon her murderer exactly one week later. She was never seen alive again by any of her relatives, and for a time her fate was a profound mystery. But even the fact of her disappearance was not known until after she had become the prey of the abortionist and, packed in the narrow compass of that trunk, her remains had been gazed upon by thousands. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday she was not missed in the circle where she was so dearly prized. Her mother, who remained with Mrs. Williams, supposed she was at home, and her relatives in Paterson, who had not heard of her departure from Newark, believed that she was still with her aunt. 
                
                
                  LITTLE ROSA. 
                  On Thursday Captain Cameron arrested Rosa, the daughter, hoping to elicit something from her about the person who had transferred the trunk from the house to the depot. Soon Rosa was brought in as a kind of prisoner at large, and was permitted to occupy the captain's room, where she sat by the window reading most of the morning. The doctor was not quite as comfortable as he had been. He was much more irritable than he was the day before. He stared at anybody who approached him with a desire to chat. The Jew peddler was also among the unfortunates again. He had been released, but was rearrested on Thursday, by order of the Inspector, and lodged with his friends at the station-house all night. 
                
                
                  DECEASED'S AUNT IDENTIFIES HER. 
                  In the forenoon of Thursday, a lady drove up to the station-house in a close carriage. She was shown into the captain's private room, and had a long talk with him, in which she disclosed the fact that she was Mrs. Barriet L. Williams, of No. 80 Bellmont avenue, Newark, N. J., and the aunt of Alice Bowlsby, who had been staying at her house previous to her departure for New York last Wednesday. She said that she believed that from what she had gleaned concerning her niece's habits that Walter F. Conklin, of Paterson, was the seducer. She then drove to the Morgue and identified her niece. Thence she returned with a detective to the Central Office, and had an interview with the Inspector, to whom she repeated her story. 
                
                
                  JANE JOHNSON'S CONFESSION AT LAST. 
                  At last the ends of justice seemed to be nearly attained. The servant girl confessed. She was removed to Bellevue Hospital on Wednesday night, as her condition demanded it, and the kindly offices of Warden Brennan were calculated to break down her obstinacy. On Thursday he was pre-eminently successful. Calling on her during the day, he obtained the following statement from her: On Wednesday, a young lady came in by the parlor door of No. 687 Second avenue, and went into the doctor's room. He took her up stairs to a private room on the second floor. Before she entered, the doctor had run in by the basement door, in a very great hurry, and met her as she entered. Before taking her up to the other room, he came to the kitchen and looked in at me. Then he retired, and shut the door after him. Immediately I opened it a little, and peeped out. There I saw the pair-doctor and young lady-going up the stairs. I remember the white lawn over-skirt looped up behind. She remained above during the evening, so far as I can judge, for, indeed, I never heard her go out. I asked Rosa, the doctor's daughter, who she was, and she said it was a patient who had called to see her father. I wanted to know if she had gone away the previous night, and Miss Rosa replied: "Oh! yes, she went away last night." "What," said I, "in all the rain?" "Yes," said Rosa, "her friends came with a coach, and, wrapping her up comfortably, took her away." "I should have thought there was danger of her taking cold." "Not at all," said Rosa. The first day that the lady was in the house Rosa went up stairs and remained there a long time. Her mother went up afterward, and came back to the kitchen in a short time to make a cup of tea, she said. This draught, made by herself, she handed to Rosa, who took it to the upper chamber. From what I could see, Miss Rosa and her mother waited on the lady. I did not mistrust anything, and, indeed, believed all was right, when Miss Rosa told me she had gone home with her friends. On Saturday Mrs. Rosenzweig told me to hurry up with my work, as she wanted me to get through by noon and take the children out to walk. This was such an unusual proceeding that I was delighted, and did my best to get ready. Miss Rosa went out at noon, and was absent about an hour and a half, returning at 1.30 o'clock. I remember nothing more of the circumstances until I recognized the comforter and baby's diaper, which were found in the trunk, as being the property of the Rosenzweig family. The other articles I never saw before. 
                
                
                  THE VICTIM'S PATERSON HOME AND HER PREVIOUS LIFE-SUICIDE OF HER ALLEGED SEDUCER. 
                  The city of Paterson was intensely exiced last Thursday, first by the announcement in the morning papers that the victim was a Paterson girl, and later in the day by the report that the young man who had kept company with her before her disappearance had taken his own life, through fear of exposure and punishment. 
                  At about 7 o'clock the news of the identification of Miss Bowlsby's remains was broken to her widowed mother by Drs. Parker and Kinne, who on the evening preceding had identified the body at the Morgue. The grief of the mother and the younger sisters was too terrible for words to express, a sense of disgrace and shame mingling with their sorrow for the loss of one whom they had loved as innocent and pure. For an entire
                      
                      
                        The Detectives enter Rosenzweig's house in search of the "Doctor." 
                        
                           Die Geheimpolizisten dringen in Rosenzweigs Haus, als sie den "Doktor" suchten.
                         
                     
                      week they had been in suspense, waiting for the news of Alice. Eight days previous she had left the house of her aunt. Mrs. Elizabeth L. Williams, in Newark, to return to her mother's house in Paterson. She did not arrive home on the day fixed and inquiries were sent to Newark, for information of her. Word was returned that she had left Mrs. Williams' house, where she had been staying about three weeks, and ought to have arrived home on the preceding day. Then the search for the missing girl commenced. Her uncle Mr. Charles E. Sandford, of Broadway, Paterson her cousins. Henry Sandford and John Williams, of Newark; and D. Kinne the family physician gave nearly all their time for several days is endeavoring to trace her. A visit by young Sandford to the Morgue gave the first faint hope of success in finding her or learning her fate. He thought he recognized the body of the then unknown murdered girl, and the subsequent identification by Drs. Parker and Kinne, whom he induced to come to the Morgue, proved the correctness of his supposition. 
                
                
                  THE BEREAVED FRIENDS AND HOME. 
                  The information was unexpected to Mrs. Bowlsby on Thursday morning, when she was informed of the identification of the body, for neither young Sandford nor the doctors had hinted their suspicions regarding the body at the Morgue to the bereaved mother. Friends and acquaintances dropped in to console her and the two young daughters in their terrible affliction. Occasionally a small crowd would gather in the street to look at the dwelling where the poor girl had spent the last years of her life. It is a small, two-story brick house, situated on West street, bearing the sign, "Mrs. Bowlsby, Dressmaking," in small, gilt letters. To this house the family removed ten years ago from Parsippany, upon the death of Mr. Bowlsby. Mrs. Bowlsby, with her three daughters, worked at dressmaking, Alice having been employed recently in an establishment at No. 163 Main street, over the office of Drs. Parker and Kinne. Alice and her sisters were esteemed by all who knew them, and not only Alice's mother, but all her acquaintances, believed her to be strictly virtuous. In answer to inquiries made on Thursday morning, the friends of the family stated that they could not say who was the seducer of Alice; they suspected a young man whose name would not be given until the inquest should be held. Dr. Parker was reluctant to give any information except that the murdered girl was well known to him as a pure, high-minded girl, whom he would never have suspected under any circumstances. He thought he could identify the man who had wronged her, but he believed that she had gone there alone, and that the man whom he suspected had nothing to do with the murder. The doctor exhibited a photograph of the deceased, a well-formed and intelligent looking blonde, with bright eyes, full lips and smiling face. The photograph agreed with the description given of her by the doctor and other friends of the deceased, and would indicate that she was what they pronounced her to be-a joyous good-natured girl, free of manner and fond of amusement, who had friends wherever she was known. 
                
                
                  THE GIRL'S DESTROYER. 
                  Many stories were carried from one to another, giving the names of Miss Bowlsby's male friends. But it was, however, learned, by the statements of Mrs. Williams, of Newark, that Walter F. Conklin, the son of Alderman Conklin, had been very much attached to her, and had visited her at Mrs. Williams' house in Newark, three days before Alice left for New York. Mrs. Williams did not hesitate to say that he was responsible for Alice's misfortune. At 1 o'clock all the city was convinced that this supposition was correct. At that hour young Conklin committed suicide in Dale's Silk Mill, where he was employed. Conklin arrived at the mill early on Thursday morning, looking pale and nervous. He remained at his desk during the forenoon, conversing but little, and when spoken to concerning the absorbing sensation caused by the reports in the morning papers, he spoke of it as a matter of no consequence to him. At noon he did not go to dinner according to custom. While the other clerks were at dinner, one of the men employed in the mill heard the report of a pistol. He ran immediately to the office, but found no one, and continued his search, going into the large fire-proof room, where the most valuable silks were stored. On the floor he found Conklin's prostrate form. Blood was flowing from a wound back of the left ear, where the bullet entered. A revolver was found on the floor beside him. The man dragged the body out into the office and sent for physicians, at the same time sending information also to Alderman Conklin. When the physicians arrived they found that the wound was fatal, the ball having passed through to the temple, where it lodged. The dying man did not move. Within half an hour he was dead. Coroner Butterworth was immediately summoned and viewed the body. In one of the pockets was found the following note in young Conklin's handwriting: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              I have long had a morbid idea of the worthlessness of life, and now to be obliged to testify in this affair and cause unpleasantness in my family is more than life is worth. Good by, dear father, mother, brother and sister. 
                              
                                 WALT.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  In his pocket a card was found on which was written, in his own hand "115 E. 24th st." 
                
                
                  INQUEST ON THE SUICIDE. 
                  Coroner Butterworth immediately impanelled a jury and commenced an inquest. The testimony of the physician, the workmen at the mill, and others cognizant of facts connected with the shooting, was taken, after which the jury rendered a verdict that the deceased came to his death by his own hand. 
                
                
                   
                  INTERVENING MOVEMENTS. 
                  About Miss Bowlsby's movements, after she left Mrs. Williams' house in Newark, but little can be learned. Her mother, who went to Newark with her, returned home. She left Alice only money enough to pay her fare from Newark to Paterson. When she left Mrs. Williams' house, at  o'clock on Wednesday before her death, she had only eighty cents. She could not therefore have paid Dr. Rosenzweig the amount which he would be likely to have demanded. Somebody must have accompanied her, or have gone before her and paid for the doctor's services. 
                
                
                  SHE WAS SEEN IN NEW YORK. 
                  On Monday, the 21st inst., Miss Bowlsby was met in company with another Paterson woman by Mr. Wm. J. Healey, of No. 82 Main street, Paterson. Mr. Healey states that he met Alice twice in Broadway, near St. Paul's Church. The woman who accompanied her he knew, but cannot remember her name. It is thought probable that Miss Bowlsby went to New York without giving her aunt any intimation of her movements on Monday, and that this woman helped to make the arrangements with her. From the circumstances of the case, it is certain that young Conklin furnished the money, but whether it was he who inquired in New York on Saturday if the trunk had been sent up the river, cannot be known at present. Conklin was known to have gone to New York on Saturday, returning in the evening. He had money. His father is one of the owners of the Dale Silk Mill where young Conklin worked, and the latter drew a good salary as book-keeper. 
                
                
                  SAD COINCIDENCES AND CIRCUMSTANCES. 
                  On Wednesday evening, while Drs. Parker and Kinne were looking at the remains of Alice in New York, Mrs. Bowlsby and young Conklin were conversing about her in Paterson. Conklin called to inquire if anything had been heard from her, and appeared to be concerned for her safety Mrs. Bowlsby, who was almost crazy with alarm for her daughter's safety suggested that the body found in the trunk might be hers. Conklin said "Oh, no; that couldn't be Alice." Conklin was about twenty years old-the same age as his victim. He had visited Miss Bowlsby for over two years. He went to Europe last year, but returned in September, resuming upon his return his intimacy with her. He was a young man of good appearance, tall and well-proportioned, and dressed with scrupulous neatness. In the mills where he worked no one knew of his acquaintance with Alice Bowlsby, and with the sad news of the suicide came the first intimation to Mr. Conklin, sr., of his son's intimacy with the murdered girl. 
                
                
                   
                  THE INQUEST AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL. 
                  The inquest on the body of Alice Augusta Bowlsby was held on Friday by Coroner Schirmer at Bellevue Hospital. The following jury was empanelled: Samuel W. Baldwin, No, 162 West Forty-fourth street; Charles McLacklin, No. 11 Park Bow; Welcome Alexander, Bellevue Hospital; Adolph B. George, No. 118 Third avenue; Duncan C. Lee, Bellevue Hospital; Thomas C. Wilson, No. 107 King street; Peter G Standish, No. 853 Third avenue. At about 10 A. M. Rosenzweig was Brought in, accompanied by his counsel, Mr. Howe. He was a little paler han usual, and somewhat nervous in his behaviour. A large number of spectators were present, and others crowded around the doors to hear the testimony. Before beginning to hear the examination, Coroner Schirmer took out the jurors to view the body, which was then only a loathsome, putrid mass of flesh. The first witness called was Dr. Theodore Y. Kinne, a practising physician in Paterson, New Jersey. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF DR. KINNE. 
                  Q. Go on, doctor, and tell what you know-about this case. A. My attention was first drawn to this case by seeing the reports in the Sunday and Monday papers of this city, coupled with the fact that a young lady patient of mine had mysteriously disappeared; the resemblance to this person in the account led me to suspect that the two were identical; I consulted with Dr. Parker, a dentist occupying rooms in the same building, No. 163 Main street, and, on Tuesday morning, the 29th, I came to Bellevue Hospital to view the body; the warden directed me to the room, where I found the corpse with only the face and head exposed; I found two marks upon the face which seemed to justify my suspicion, one being a scar upon the right side of the jaw, and the missing right eye tooth; I think I had with me the photographs of the young lady for whom I was searching, which I showed to the warden, to see if he could detect any similarity between them and the body the day it was found; he was not satisfied with the resemblance, and I returned to Paterson for further proof; in company with Dr. Parker, I visited Mrs. Bowlsby, the mother of the girl, and obtained other evidence which would be conclusive; Wednesday afternoon, the 30th, I visited Bellevue Hospital with Dr. Parker and on presenting the proofs to Warden Brennan we were permitted to view the body, and identified it fully as Miss Alice Augusta Bowlsby. 
                  Q. What proofs? A. The scar on the right side of the jaw, and a nole upon the left side of the neck, and the vaccination mark below the elbow of the left arm; the Warden, being satisfied, took us to Captain Cameron at the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, and from there to Police Headquarters; we then returned to the Eighteenth Precinct, and went from there to No. 687 Second avenue, if possible to identify the clothing worn by the young lady we found but one article which we could positively identify: a cambric hem-stitched handkerchief was found by Detective Larne, and identified by a mark placed upon it by him, and by the name in the opposite corner, "A. A. Bowlsby;" there was also a blue sash found, which corresponded with the article worn when she left; that was all we could identify, and we returned to the station-house and went home to Paterson; I have attended the family; attended the young lady for five years; longer than the rest; for common diseases, such as intermittent fever and inflammation of the lungs. 
                  Q. Has she consulted you lately? A. I think she visited me on the 1st of June, and I gave her some medicine; I think it was for menstrual derangements. 
                  Q. Did you ever know her to be in the family way? A. No, sir. 
                  Q. Had you any suspicion of it? A. No, sir, for the reason that } had treated her so lately for difficulties arising in a manner that I knew she was not. 
                  Q. This body that you have seen a little while ago is it the same body of Alice Augusta Bowlsby? A. I think it is. 
                  Q. (By a juror): Have you any doubt of it? A. None at all. 
                  Q. (By a juror): Is it frequent to vaccinate persons under the elbow on the left arm? A. I never saw but one other case, and that was of a lady who did it herself; it is very rare. 
                  Q. (By a juror): Did you vaccinate this young lady? A. No, sir, she was vaccinated when an infant. Q. Do you know that she was vaccinated in the left arm below the elbow? A. Yes, sir. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF DR. JOSEPH F. PARKER. 
                  Witness.-I am a doctor in Paterson; I am not in business for myself; my attention was first called to this affair by the murdered girls mother sending to my house for me on Sunday; they informed me that their daughter had been missing since Wednesday, when she left Newark for New York on the 9 o'clock train; the mother was in great distress of mind; and wanted to know what was best to do; I advised her to remain quiet for a few days, and see if we did not hear from the girl, as she might possibly be detained on the road; when I heard about the finding of a murdered girl in the trunk, I thought it a strange coincidence, as the description of the body applied so nearly to the appearance of Miss Bowlsby then Dr. Kinne asked me if I was willing to go with him the following afternoon and view the body, and see if we could identify it; I was omewhat familiar with the condition of her teeth, having operated on hem for her two or three years ago; we went to Bellevue and saw the body, and identified it from the filling of the upper teeth on the right upper jaw, and also by the broken eye-tooth on the right side; she consulted me about three months ago in regard to the removal of that eye-tooth; I examined the root of it, and was of the opinion that it should be pulled, and I suggested putting one in its place; the form of the eve-tooth as I saw it the other day was the same as when I viewed it three months ago, with no perceptible change in its appearance. 
                  Q. Did you recognize the body by any other marks? A. I recognized it from a cicatrized ulcer on the right lower jaw from inflammation caused by a bad tooth, owing to its having been lanced on the side; it caused a slight depression in the bone. 
                  Q. What about identifying the articles of clothing? A. I can only corroborate Dr. Kinne in the matter of the handkerchief and sash. 
                  Q. Is the body you have just now seen the same that you identified? A. It is. 
                  Q. What is the reason that you did not mention to Mrs. Bowlsby your apprehension that the victim of the murder and her daughter were identical? A. From motives of delicacy, because I had never believed the young lady would do as she did. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM PICKETT, THE CARMAN. 
                  Witness.-I am a carman, and reside at No. 471 First avenue; my stand is at Twenty-ninth street and First avenue; on Saturday afternoon, after 1 o'clock, I was hired by a young woman, who came up to the stand and asked me how much I would charge to take a trunk from Thirty-seventh street and Second avenue to the Hudson River depot; I told her one dollar; she offered me half a dollar, and I would not take it; she then asked me if I could change a $5 bill; I told her no, and she went into a liquor store at the corner, and came out and told me she could not get it changed; I told her I could; I took the bill and went and changed it; I came right back and gave her $4, keeping the $1 myself; she asked me if I would go right away for the trunk; she was going to Paterson, and wanted the trunk taken away right off; she was going to hire a carriage and would be to the depot before me and wanted me to go to No. 687 Second avenue; I wrote the number down myself; she told me to go to the basement and ring the bell and I would be given the trunk; I would not go on those terms without getting her real name, because I was afraid I might not get the trunk at all; she told me her name was Julia Sidney, and I wrote down her name on the same card; I went then to this house, rang the basement bell, and a man opened the door and stepped back while I stepped in; I told him that a girl named Julia Sidney sent me after a trunk; there was a woman sitting in the inside who asked me where I was going; I told her that Julia Sidney told me not to tell: I found the trunk in the front basement, inside the door; the man inside assisted me to put the trunk on my truck; then he went right in again; didn't speak to me at all. 
                  Q. Could you recognize the man? A. Yes, sir. 
                  Q. Do you see him here now? A. Yes, sir; that is the man sitting right there, only he looks paler now than he did then, to the best of my knowledge; (the witness pointed to Rosenzweig, who muttered some inaudible words to his counsel, Mr. Howe, and appeared considerably perturbed). I then took the trunk to the depot and returned to my stand. 
                   
                   
                  
                      
                        ARREST OF DR. JACOB ROSENZWEIG. 
                        
                           Arretirung des Dr. Jacob Rosenzweig.
                         
                     
                   
                   
                  Q. Did you perceive any smell from the trunk? 
                  A. No, sir; I formed no suspicion, and didn't smell it; when I got to the depot I saw this Julia Sidney standing there; Julia Sidney assisted me with it; then the boy helped me in with the trunk; the boy and Julia Sidney took one end of the trunk and I the other, and we put it upon the counter; she looked at the lock and said the trunk was not strong enough, and she asked for a rope, and they had no rope but had a strap; some body asked her if she know the price of the strap, and she said she would pay $1 for it. 
                  Q. Have you seen the trunk since? A. Yes, sir, in Warden Brennan's charge, and I recognize it as the trunk I carried to the depot that day. 
                  Q. Are you able to give a description of that young lady? A. No. sir. 
                  Q. (By a juror): What was it that Julia Sidney requested you not to tell? A. If any one asked me where I was taking the trunk not to tell them. 
                  Several other witnesses were called directly after the foregoing, including the boy, Alexander Potts, who met the strange woman with the trunk at the depot; but nothing new or additional to that heretofore given was elicited from them. We may add, however, from the 
                
                
                  BOY POTTS 
                  the following scrap: 
                  Q. Was she dressed like a servant? A. Yes. 
                  Q. Did you see the trunk again? A. I saw it before it was taken from the depot; I saw the body in it. 
                  Q. Did you hear her say anything in particular to the truckman? No, sir. 
                  Q. Was there any stench coming from the trunk? A. No, sir, I didn't smell anything. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF THE BAGGAGE-MASTER 
                  Frank Dunning, the baggage-master at the Hudson River Railroad depot, testified that the woman who checked the trunk stated to him that she must have a strap, as the trunk was weak; I put a strap around it; and nailed it on; there was no name or address on the trunk; I checked it for Chicago, and wrote "Chicago" on it; I was present when the trunk was opened, and saw the body 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF ROSENZWEIG'S SERVANT GIRL 
                  Jane Johnson testified that she had been living at "Dr." Rosenzweig's house, No. 687 Second avenue, three months, doing general housework; am a widow; my husband has been dead six years; I have received ten dollars a month wages. 
                  Q. Do you remember about a certain young lady coming there on Wednesday or Thursday of last week? A. I saw a young woman there then in the afternoon; saw her going up stairs, and that is all I saw of her; did not see her face at all, and don't know how she looks; she had on a white dress. (The blue sash was shown to the witness, but she stated that she never saw it.) 
                  Q Have you seen anything here in the hospital that you can identify as being at that house? A. Yes, sir; I have seen a comforter, a small piece of muslin, and a diaper. 
                  Q. Did the doctor sometimes have patients there? A. Yes, sir. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF DR. CUSHMAN. 
                  Deputy Coroner Cushman testified that he had made a post-mortem examination of the body; he found the womb large, and evidence that a ftus had been expelled; there was a laceration, which was probably produced by some sharp instrument; death, in his opinion, had been caused by metro-peritonitis, the result of an abortion. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF WARDEN BRENNAN. 
                  Warden Brennan corrobarated the testimony already given in regard to the carman Pickett's story, and testified that he was present when the body of the girl was identified, and also when the woman Johnson identified the comforter which had been taken from the trunk. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF J. D. LARNE. 
                  John D. Larne testified-I am a policeman of the Eighteenth Precinct; on Wednesday evening last I went to No. 687 Second avenue with some keys for Capt. Cameron; he met me at the door, and we began a search through the house for some trace of the young lady; we went into the back basement, where there were two wash-tubs; in one of these I found a handkerchief marked "A. A. Bowlsby." (Witness then identified a handkerchief shown him by the coroner as the one he found.) 
                  Coroner Schirmer at this point asked the jury if they were prepared, with the testimony they had heard, to bring in a verdict, or would they prefer to hear further evidence. The jury replying through their foreman that the testimony had been abundant to enable them to reach a decision, the room was cleared, and they retired for consultation. After ten minutes' deliberation they returned to their seats, and the foreman read the following: 
                
                
                  THE VERDICT. 
                  We find that Alice Augusta Bowlsby came to her death by metro-peritonitis, the result of an abortion produced, as we believe from the testimony, by Jacob Rosenzweig, between the 23d and 26th of August, 1871, at No. 687 Second avenue. 
                  Coroner Schirmer (turning to the prisoner, who arose).-You will act your pleasure in answering the questions I am about to ask you. 
                   
                  Mr. Howe.-He will answer any question you may ask him. 
                  Q. What is your name? A. Jacob Rosenzweig. 
                  Q. How old are you? A. Thirty-nine years. 
                  Q. Of what nationality are you? A. I am a Pole. 
                  Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 687 Second avenue. 
                  Q. What is your business? A. I am a physician. 
                  Q. You have heard the verdict of the jury; have you any answer to make against the charge? 
                  Mr. Howe.-The prisoner has a perfect answer to the accusation, and believes that before the calm deliberations of a legal tribunal he can make a perfect defence. He believes that a great deal of the testimony admitted here has been illegally admitted; but with that you have nothing to do. In regard to the atrocities and to this abortion charged upon him, he gives an emphatic denial, and declares that he is not guilty. 
                  The prisoner was then committed to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury. 
                  The writ of habeas corpus in favor of Rosenzweig was not served on Friday, inasmuch as it was merely designed to procure his release on bail in case the coroner had seen fit to postpone the inquest. Another writ was obtained from Judge Jones with a view to secure the discharge of Rosa Rosenzweig, the doctor's daughter, but the coroner released her at the close of the investigation. 
                  The police authorities endeavored to accumulate further evidence on Friday, but without material success. Professional pride dictated that the woman who so daringly guarded the trunk at the depot should be traced and arrested, but further effort in this direction was generally felt to be useless. Not a clue remained of the many that had been perseveringly followed to a disappointing conclusion. A long search was made among Rosenzweig's relatives, but none were found to resemble the woman described by the boy Potts. 
                  The efforts to arrest Mrs. Rosenzweig were discontinued, it being very well determined that she would testify only in her husband's defence. The testimony of other witnesses was found to be needless, and the Jew peddler, arrested in the house, was therefore discharged from custody. 
                
                
                  THE DESOLATED PATERSON HOMES. 
                  Both the Bowlsby and Conklin houses were closed on Friday, and few except sympathizing friends called upon the families. Walter F. Conklin's body was placed in a coffin and removed on Thursday evening to his father's house at Water and North Main streets, after the remains had been viewed by a great number of the inhabitants of Paterson. 
                
                
                  DISCOVERY OF FURTHER LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE. 
                  More evidence proving the identity of Alice Bowlsby, and establishing the guilt of the monster Rosenzweig, was discovered on Saturday. Sergeant geant Rooney, in searching the house of Rosenzweig, at No. 687 Second avenue, found a false bosom, such as is used by women. Taking it, with other female wearing apparel, to the servant girl, Jane Johnson, now at Bellevue Hospital, he asked Jane if it belonged to her. Jane said that it did not, and was not in the house before the strange young lady came. The bosom was taken back to the Eighteenth Precinct Station-house, and Captain Cameron sent an officer to Paterson, to the home of the murdered girl, to ascertain if the bosom had been her property. Her mother, Mrs Bowlsby, identified it at once as having been made in her house, and worn by her daughter. It will be used as circumstantial evidence against Rosenzweig. Captain Cameron also sent the boy Potts, and the truckman William Pickett, to identify a fortune-teller, Mrs. Bailey, in Paterson who was suspected to have been the one who accompanied the trunk to the depot, and exhibited so much coolness about the horrible business. The suspected woman, however, could not be identified, and she has so far baffled every attempt at discovery. 
                
                
                  THE ABORTIONIST'S BAYARD STREET HOUSE. 
                  The neighborhood of the house, at No. 98 Bayard street, was visited by a reporter last Saturday, and it being the Jewish Sabbath, the windows of the butcher were closed, though the door was open. About a dozen persons, male and female, were in front of the house, and through the open door of the shop the wife of Rosenzweig, his daughter Rosa, mother, and brothers, were seen moving about. Mrs. Rosenzweig had her bonnet on, as though she might have just come in; and the daughter Rosa was smiling and showing no outward signs of sorrow for the present rather uncomfortable position of her father. The drug-clerk, in the store opposite, told the reporter that "Dr." Rosenzweig had frequently got medicine there, always coming himself for it, but his employer being absent, he could not tell what he got when he came. He said, also, that owing to the large number of Polish Jews living in the neighborhood, Rosenzweig did a large business in that vicinity. 
                
                
                  FUNERAL OF WALTER CONKLIN. 
                  On Saturday the funeral of Walter Conklin took place at the residence of his father, No. 8 North Main street, Paterson. Only a few of the friends of the family were present. Rev. Dr. Banvard, pastor of the First Baptist Church, to which the family belong, preached the funeral sermon. The remains were placed in the receiving vault of Cedar Lawn Cemetery. 
                
                
                  ROSENZWEIG'S GUILT 
                  The chain of circumstantial evidence against "Dr." Jacob Rosenzweig, alias Ascher, is very strong, but the unfortunate failure of the police to secure the woman who engaged the truckman, Pickett, will leave the prosecution without any witness who can positively swear that the accused cused performed the operation which resulted in Alice Bowlsby's death. The principal points thus far established are as follows: 
                  
                     First. The discovery of the dead body with unmistakable indications that an abortion had been committed. 
                  
                     Second. The removal of the trunk containing the remains from the house of Rosenzweig, on Second avenue. 
                  
                     Third. The identification of Rosenzweig by the truckman as his assistant in transferring the trunk from the basement to the truck. 
                  
                     Fourth. The identification of the remains by the Paterson physicians. 
                  
                     Fifth. The discovery of the sash and marked handkerchief in Rosenzweig's house. 
                  
                     Sixth. The identification of the clothes in the trunk by the servant. 
                  
                     Seventh. Rosenzweig's application to the undertaker on Saturday morning to bury a servant girl. 
                  
                     Eighth. Rosenzweig's bad character, suspicious practice, and numerous aliases. 
                  The non-identification of the remains was to have been made the principal point in Rosenzweig's favor, but the appearance of the Paterson physicians demolished that defence. 
                  It is expected that the defence will now be based upon the absence of witnesses to the abortion. Rosenzweig must have been instructed upon this point by his counsel, as whenever he is pressed he exclaims: "Who saw me kill her? no one saw me operate on her." 
                
                
                  THE REMAINS OF ALICE AUGUSTA. 
                  The body of Alice Augusta Bowlsby was quietly buried on Hart's Island at 5 o'clock Saturday morning. Her friends sent word during the day asking that her remains be forwarded to Paterson for interment. 
                
                
                  THE BOY POTTS. 
                  President Smith and Superintendent Kelso, in consideration of the aid which the boy Potts has given the police, have opened an account for him in one of the savings banks. 
                
                
                  A LINK OF EVIDENCE. 
                  A valuable link in the evidence against Rosenzweig came to light in Newark, N. J. It may be stated, en passant, that the case of the unfortunate Alice Bowlsby excites as much attention in Newark as in New York, from the fact that she was quite well known there, had for years lived there, and has near relatives now living there. On Sunday two gentlemen called on a New York reporter in Newark, and stated that two years ago a lady of the latter city, who was suffering greatly from a breast cancer, consulted a female physician in New York, who advertised in the leading German paper of New York as Madame Schwartz, of Henry street. By the latter she was referred to "Dr" Ascher, alias Rosenzweig, who "treated" her case. Instead of growing better, however, she grew worse under his care, and, after paying Ascher, alias Rosenzweig, nearly $300, she died. This Madame Schwartz is described as being the exact counterpart of the woman who conveyed the boxed-up body to the Hudson River Depot, and shipped it to Chicago. 
                
             
             
               A GENERAL RETROSPECTION OF THE CRIME! 
               MISTAKEN IDENTITY! WHAT HAS BECOME OF FIGA? 
               THE UNKNOWN WOMAN AND THE TRUNK! 
               There is many a true word spoken in jest, and "many a true story culled from a fleeting rumor." The reader should know that the exact accounts, as given in the previous pages of this pamphlet, were not known for some time after the occurrence of this tragedy, and that during the first days of the excitement all sorts of rumors were circulated and believed by the great majority. Still, it is not our purpose to give here any of those rumors which scarcely contained plausibility, but to place before the reader those rumors and side events which were not noticed at the time, but which may yet explain and bring to light many things connected with this sad affair, now under a cloud of mystery. To do this, it is necessary that we go back to the first, that we make general and comprehensive retrospection, and we can do so in no better manner than by commencing with the coroner's inquest on the body of young Walter Conklin, of Paterson, N. J. 
                
                  THE INQUEST. 
                  Coroner Abram Butterworth having been summoned took charge of the body, and it was removed to the undertaker shop of J. W. Ensign, No. 271 Main street, and placed on ice in a patent ice coffin in the back room of the shop. A large crowd of persons visited the place during the afternoon and looked upon the dead man's face. A jury was quickly summoned, and subpnas were sent out for the necessary witnesses. At 7 o'clock they had all gathered in the undertaker's shop. 
                  The jury were John Buckley, foreman, Enoch Dobson, John E. More house, Peter G. Hopper, John Pettigrew, Isaac Condit, Robert Morris, Charles E. Noble, and Charles E. Atherton. After taking the oath, and viewing the body by the light of two kerosene lamps, the jury adjourned at 7 o'clock to a room in the Paterson Opera House, almost directly across the street. The windows were darkened, and nobody was allowed in the room but the reporters and the witnesses. 
                  Oswald Warner M. D., was the first witness. He testified as follows
                      
                      
                        Rosenzweig's cellar searched. Startling circumstantial evidence against the accused. 
                        
                           Rosenzweig's Keller durchsucht. Schreckenerregender zuflliger Beweis gegen den Angeklagten.
                         
                      
                      
                        Sucide of Walter Conklin, of Paterson, N. J., lover of Miss Alice Bowlsby. 
                        
                           Selbstmord von Walter Conklin aus Paterson, N. J., Geliebter von Alice Bowlsby.
                         
                     
                      I was called to see deceased about 1 o'clock. I was coming down Willet street, near State, and was asked to go and see a young man who had burst a blood vessel in his ear; he was alive when I got there; I was asked to go to Dale's mill; I found the man lying on the floor with blood and brains issuing from his ear, and from the wound behind the ear; also little fragments of bone; I was then told that he had shot himself; the wound was plainly such a one as would be produced by a pistol shot he was in a hopeless condition, with no opportunity of anything being done to save his life; he lived probably about ten minutes after my arrival; he was entirely insensible; didn't speak at all; after his death I passed my finger into the wound as far as I could and found it penetrated the scalp and went upward, forward and toward the opposite side; there was a prominence on the upper portion of the temple, which probably was caused by the ball breaking the bone, but not having been sent with sufficient force to break through; the wound was 
                
                
                  SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE DEATH, 
                  and was undoubtedly the cause of death; his brother told me the reason of his suicide was on account of some scandal; a number of people were standing around, among them Dr. Terberry and Dr. Quinn; when I saw him he was not in the vault but in the room back of the main office; I didn't see any weapon. 
                  Mr. John Waltham, superintendent of the raw silk department in the mill, was next sworn. He said: I went to work about fifteen minutes to 1 this afternoon. A girl came to my house and told my wife that Conklin had shot himself. This was between the time I left the mill and returned. 
                
                
                  THE BODY WAS IN THE BACK OFFICE 
                  when I arrived. I had a conversation with him before the shooting, at fifteen minutes past 12. I asked him what he thought of the trunk affair; his reply was that it was rather mixed up; I asked him how it was so; he replied that unfortunately he had been a visitor at the young lady's house, and he expected that a report would come naturally to the mill; he did not say what report; I asked him if the report affected him in the least; his reply was that it had not; I asked him if he knew anything about the affair, and he gave me an evasive answer; I noticed he was rather pale about fifteen minutes after eight, the time the papers usually come; I had no other conversation with him on the subject; I did not know him to be absent any time last week; he could not be absent from the mill half a day without my knowing it; his brother called to see him between 9 and 10 o'clock; I spoke to him merely out of curiosity. 
                  Mr. John L. Conklin, the dead man's brother, arrived at this moment, and took the witness stand. He is a tall, thin young man, with an emaciated face, a thin mustache and dark hair. He was dressed in black, and 
                
                
                   
                  WORE A LARGE DIAMOND PIN. 
                  He testified as follows.-I last saw my brother alive between 1 and 2; he was dying at the time; I saw him also about 9 o'clock in the front office of Dale's mill; I have been in the habit of calling there very seldom; I had a letter to deliver to him to-day, which he considered very important; he spoke about it many times; it was from Russia, and was written in the Russian language; I had but one letter, and that was from Russia; I had some conversation with him about the trunk affair this morning; I asked my brother if he had seen the morning paper yet; he said, "Yes, it is terrible, isn't it?" My brother was sitting at a desk, when I entered, writing; I first handed him the letter; I replied, "Yes; it was." I told him I was sorry he was in the habit of calling at the lady's house; I told him I was afraid he would be brought up also; he said, "Yes; but that there had been a great many in the habit of calling at the house." I said, "Yes, I supposed everybody who called at the house for the last year would be brought up also." I told him there was thirty-one cents due on the letter. He said, "All right." That was all; I was not talking with him ten minutes; I think the portrait in the locket is that of 
                
                
                  A YOUNG LADY IN RUSSIA. 
                  I heard him say it was his wife, in a joking way. He was as cheerful as usual, except a slight depression on account of the letter from Russia, after he had read a part of it. He had been expecting to go back to Russia during the last six months. 
                  Frederick S. Dale, the son of the proprietor of the mill, a very young man, was the next witness.-I was absent when the shooting took place. I know nothing about it; I had a conversation with Mr. Conklin; I came to the mill this morning about 10; as I entered my small office he handed me the paper, pointing to the trunk affair, and remarked what a horrible thing it was. He wished that he hadn't been a caller at the young lady's house, as he supposed he would be called as a witness. He remarked that it was an unpleasant thing, but that he would be willing to face the music; that was his expression. That was all that passed between us then. I asked him if he would go to dinner, and he remarked that he would; he then said that all callers at the house would 
                
                
                  MOST LIKELY BE BROUGHT UP. 
                  That was all that passed between us. He was not absent last week to my knowledge; it he had been absent I would have heard of it; I was out of town myself last week; somebody told me about Mr. Conklin's being absent; I spoke to him about it, and he said he was absent last Sunday and the Sunday before. His position was that of time-keeper; I don't know whether the record of Saturday was in his hand or not; about his absence on Sunday he remarked that he was at his cousin's; he could prove it, and it would be unpleasant to bring them into it. Mr. Hurst or Mr. Dale, my brother, would know if he was absent on Saturday or not; the time marks are made in pencil going through the factory, and afterward copied in ink; some one else could have taken the time, and Conklin could have copied it afterward. I never saw him with a revolver. When I opened the vault door for the coroner today I discovered the revolver (pistol shown). It is the same; it belongs to the mill; the night watchman carries it; Mr. Conklin carried a key to the stock safe (key shown); that is the one. 
                  John H. Waltham recalled.-I said to Conklin if he was implicated in the matter I would like to know about it. He said that if the worst came to the worst he would face the music; I never told any one that he had any conversation with me relative to an abortion case. There was nothing further said. 
                
                
                  CORONER'S CHARGE. 
                  Coroner Butterworth then charged the jury in a ludicrously incoherent manner, and at great length. It was with great difficulty that his listeners could restrain their laughter, and several actually burst out into a loud guffaw two or three times during its delivery. He named a great many different modes of death of which they could find young Conklin guilty, and the room was cleared to permit the Jurors to deliberate. But they could find no verdict on the evidence. It had not been proved that Conklin had killed himself; his letter had not been read at the inquest; no cause had been assigned for the act. Indeed every effort had apparently been made to hide the true reason. So, after a lengthy debate, a vote was taken to decide whether they should adjourn and have the inquest reopened. The first result was a tie, but at 10 o'clock another vote adjourned the inquest until the following afternoon at half-past 2 o'clock. The whole affair was a great farce. 
                
                
                  SECOND DAY. 
                  Resumed at Paterson Opera House at 3 o'clock. There were many spectators. 
                  Thomas H. Hurst testified: I am bookkeeper at the Dale mill. I knew Walter Conklin. I did not see the shooting, not being there at that time. In the morning (Thursday), about a quarter past 8, he came an and stated that the trunk mystery had come to Paterson, and that the lady was a friend of his. Nothing further on the subject passed at that time. I told him I was sorry the matter had come to Paterson. I noticed 
                
                
                  CONKLIN WAS SOMEWHAT PALER THAN USUAL. 
                  Did not attach any importance to this, as I had no suspicions relative to the trunk matter. In a jocular manner I told him it would be a good thing now for him to go to Russia again. It never occurred to me that Conklin had anything to do with this matter until I went to dinner. I heard of his implication, by rumors, during the morning. Mr. Conklin was time-keeper. I have the record of the time of last week with me. (Time book produced, but every day was filled out as usual, with marks.) Conklin occupied the same room as I. He was not absent a full day last week. Don't remember that he was absent an hour on any day last week. He could not have been absent without my knowledge. I was in the office when John, his brother, called. Did not see him destroy any letter. Never saw the scraps of the Russian letter until the Coroner called to-day. 
                  These letters are torn up in small scraps, and written in Russian. They were found in the waste basket at Dale's mill. 
                  I do not know that Conklin was out last Saturday. Could not say positively that any one called to see deceased Thursday morning beside his brother. I do not know positively myself that Conklin shot himself. The mill stops at 2.30 on Saturday. Conklin left about 4 o'clock last Saturday. He usually left when his work was done. Never saw a letter from Alice Bowlsby to Conklin. 
                
                
                  A MYSTERIOUS NOTE. 
                  A note was brought into Conklin by a boy. It said: "Walter, come over; the train has not started yet." It was on a scrap of paper. Do not remember what day. The note was handed to me. Conklin was up stairs, and I sent the note to him. Conklin went out on receiving the letter. Could not swear positively what day it was. It was a lady's handwriting. It was not on Saturday, but can't say what day. It was written in pencil, and was not signed by any name. Deceased immediately went out. It was in the afternoon. He was out only five or ten minutes. I saw him when he came in. Did not notice anything excited about him. He came in and went right on to his desk as usual. Had no subsequent talk on the subject. I cannot remember the date. Can't say whether Mr. Dale was absent the same day. 
                  One of the jurors here said the boy was a boot-black, and thought he could be reached. 
                  Hurst's evidence was then read and signed, but all present were certain that much more important testimony could have been adduced from him had things been rightly managed. 
                  Marcus J. McKeon testified.-I am clerk at the Erie Railway Station in Paterson. I heard there had been a note sent over to Dale's mill. Did not see it myself; heard it was. Directly I heard Miss Bowlsby ask deceased if he had received a note, and he said "Yes." It was on 
                
                
                  THE 17TH OF AUGUST. 
                  two weeks ago Thursday; it was about 9 o'clock in the morning. I heard the boot-black had taken the note over; know of no subsequent note. I saw the two (Alice and Conklin) together; have never seen Alice there at the depot since. I have not seen Conklin at the depot since either, that I can remember; have seen Alice since the 17th ultimo, but not at the depot. 
                  Witness' testimony was thus ended abruptly. 
                  The Coroner here read the note which was found in Conklin's pocket it was the same as that previously mentioned. The handwriting was identified by Mr. Hurst, the bookkeeper. 
                  Coroner Butterworth then charged the jury again. 
                  After a few minutes consultation the jury returned the following 
                
                
                  VERDICT: 
                  We, the undersigned jurors, empanelled in the case of Walter L. Conklin, deceased, do find that he came to his death by means of a pistol shot either from his own hand, or by some person or persons unknown to the jury. And we also recommend that the Coroner be requested to have the letters, Russian and English, placed together and translated for future reference if required. 
                  This remarkable verdict was signed by all the jurors. 
                
                
                  CONKLIN'S ESCAPE FROM ARREST. 
                  Mrs. Williams, of 80 Belmont avenue, Newark, the aunt of Alice Bowlsby, at whose house the unfortunate girl had been visiting when she went to New York, is a woman of respectability and refinement. When interviewed she spoke with much emotion. She stated that she went to New York on Thursday to satisfy herself that the mysterious occupant of the trunk was Alice Bowlsby, and if so, to make such an affidavit as would insure the arrest of young Conklin. The young couple had been very intimate, and it was understood by Alice's friends that they were soon to be married. Therefore she had no doubt that Conklin was Alice's seducer. She obtained a warrant for the arrest of Conklin, and although Captain Cameron offered to send an officer with her, she proceeded alone to Paterson to have Conklin arrested. Arriving in that city she learned that death had served a warrant; that Conklin had died by his own hand. 
                
                
                  MISS BOWLSBY'S DEPARTURE FROM NEWARK. 
                  On Monday, the 21st of August, Alice and her mother arrived in Newark from Paterson, on a visit to Mrs. Williams. On Wednesday, the 23d, Alice said she had made an engagement with Conklin, and was to meet him in New York, from which place they would proceed together to Paterson. She dressed herself, taking more than ordinary pains in making her toilet, and left the house of her aunt at 80 Belmont avenue, saying she was going to meet Conklin in New York. That was the last ever seen of Alice Bowlsby alive by her aunt and mother. 
                
                
                  MISSING. 
                  On Saturday, the 26th, Mrs. Bowlsby returned to her home at Paterson, and was surprised to find that Alice had not been seen since she left with her mother on Monday for Newark. On Monday, the 28th, Mrs. Bowlsby again visited Newark, for the purpose of tracing her daughter. Mrs. Williams said she then knew of the terrible trunk tragedy, but did not for a moment suspect that Alice, who always was a good girl, was the victim. If for a moment she associated Alice with the girl found in the baggage-room, the idea was quickly dispelled, for the newspapers stated that the victim in the trunk was of full figure, well proportioned, and handsome, while Alice was delicate and frail, and was not what might be termed good looking; and the girl found was represented to be about 20, whereas Alice was 28
                        The difficulty in arriving at the exact age of a lady will account for these differences in stated age of the late Alice Bowlsby.
                      years old. Remembering that Alice had stated just before she left the house that she was going to New York to keep an engagement with Conklin, Mrs. Williams advised Mrs. Bowlsby to return to Paterson at once, and question Conklin as to when and where he had last seen Alice; and threaten him with arrest if he did not tell her whereabouts. Mrs. Bowlsby 
                
                
                  WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE SUGGESTION 
                  for a moment. She declared that Conklin was a gentleman; that she held him in high esteem, and that she believed that it was impossible that he should know of her absence. Mrs. Williams saw it was useless to further advise Mrs. Bowlsby, and desisted. That evening Mrs. Bowlsby again returned to her home. On Tuesday it was suggested to Mrs. Williams that Alice might possibly be the unfortunate girl found in the baggage-room. "That was the first," said Mrs. Williams, "that the thought struck me." On Thursday morning she learned that it was indeed too true, and she immediately went to New York to take measures for the arrest of Conklin. She states that Alice was always careful and discreet in her actions, that her character had never been questioned, and that her friends and relatives were very fond of her. Mrs. Williams stated that there was nothing in the appearance or actions of Alice to indicate that she was in a delicate state, and that the idea was never dreamed of by her friends. 
                
                
                  A LETTER THAT MAY DISCLOSE SOMETHING. 
                  The following was found among many other things in Rosenzweig's house. In a fireplace in the doctor's room they found evidences of a recent fire, as if papers and perhaps clothing had been burned. Some fragments
                      
                      
                        "DR." JACOB ROSENZWEIG, ALIAS "ASCHER," ETC. 
                        
                           "Dr." Jacob Rosenzweig, alias "Ascher," u.
                         
                     
                      ments of letters were found that may possibly throw some light on the absence of some other missing lady. One of these fragments is a half sheet of large-sized note paper, closely written on both sides in a very neat lady's hand, the sheet being mutilated at the bottom. It bears neither date nor signature, but as far as legible reads as follows: 
                  "Monday Evening.-I did not get to finish my letter last night, and have not found time to touch it to-day until now. Katy was here this morning to wash. Papa started away on the early train. Clayton Hunt came for the bookcase, and beside I had to go up town. So you see I have been busy with cooking and other work beside. I am getting my dress made this week, and I had to go this morning to buy trimmings and give my measure. When I went up to the store I saw a piece of black silk, with a little white stripe in it, and I concluded that I liked it so much better than the brown that I exchanged. Brown, you know, looks so old womanish. I will have it trimmed with black satin. I got Ella a pretty white marseille, which she has made up. Mrs. Graves made it, and a pretty calico which she is making herself. I will send you scraps of our dresses when I write again. I shall be very busy with my sewing for a while. Mrs. A.-- is making my dress. Now I ha -- thing very sad to write to you -- -- will shock you very --gic who Terre Haute at once which we did. By solicitation of Dr. Waters, Mr. Washburn conducted the funeral services. O, it was heart rending. I dare not think of it. It seems to me I have just had one crash after another for the last two or three years, till my heart begins to feel numb. Those poor little motherless children! My heart bleeds to see them. Maggie wanted me to have the little girl, but I cannot take her now. She is a sweet little dear. How cruel death seems, and yet as I looked at her dear face, lying cold in death, I could not grieve altogether, for I thought of the sorrow and woe she had escaped. Her pure spirit has gone where sin and sorrow are unknown. But I did grieve that I had not seen her again in life. How I regretted that I did not go over when she sent for me! But we can never anticipate the future. What a comfort it is that I can feel that she never had an unkind thought toward me. But I must close and send this to the office. Beside if I write in this strain -- get so sad I cannot sleep; write -- immediately, and tell me every -- seen Stoddard and -- clothes and --" 
                  The following detatched paragraphs are from a letter in the same handwriting, which had been torn into fragments: 
                  "I never said any thing harsh of Scott or any one now. I think for some time I have known this life of trust. If I have not known it fully I pray God will lead me into it. And you, Maggie, you must trust God in all things. He will be your best friend. 
                  "He will tell you what I said about your coming and staying with us a while. I would like to have you, though I could offer you little besides a roof. But I told him if you and he agreed upon terms, and you wanted to stay with me a while, put my arms lovingly about you and pray that He will take very gentle care of you in this sinful world. I was not surprised at the scrap of a letter you sent to me. I knew Thomas had written to -- I never saw any one so nervous when he found you --. You would have very little to do and would have much time for books. Do as you think best. Mary and Amy Johnson have a school at Poughkeepsie, a boarding school. Hannah was there the other day and asked me your address; said she wanted to write, was sick; was well just two weeks, then was sick again. I suffered unutterable pain. I don't think you ever saw me look so badly as I did last week. I was very pale. Those Johnsons-tattling yet-Stoddard-" 
                
                
                  TWO MORE STRANGE WOMEN. 
                  The mysterious young woman who engaged Pickett's trunk, and afterwards received the trunk at the depot and had it checked for Chicago, after leaving Pickett to go for the trunk, walked down Third avenue, and was joined by two others rather better dressed than herself. The three turned into Twenty-third street. They passed the livery stable of Jas. S. Selden, at 156 East Twenty-third street, on the opposite side of the way, and scrutinized it so closely as to attract the attention of some of the employs. The woman that had engaged the truck finally crossed the street and entered the office of the stable, while her companions passed on and have not since been seen. On entering the office the woman asked for a coup to take her to the Hudson River railroad station. After arranging the terms, Frank Cooper, a driver, was called and ordered to hitch up his coup, which he did, when the woman got in and was driven to the depot. Her subsequent operations in buying a ticket for Chicago, securing a check for the trunk to the same destination, and then disappearing without attempting to take the train, have already been told. 
                  This mysterious woman nor her associates, nor the man who inquired of Kerwin, the truckman, about her, have none of them since been seen, and the police have been baffled in every attempt to track them. 
                
                
                  ACCOMPLICES IN VILLANY. 
                  The identity of the corpse that Rosenzweig sought to have buried by Bayle & Boylston, and the one which was subsequently sent to the railroad station, seems to be established beyond a doubt, and thus, at least, as accomplices in the effort to conceal a monstrous crime, are inculpated at least six persons, viz.: Dr. Rosenzweig and his wife, the mysterious woman who engaged the truck and checked the trunk, and her two companions, and the unknown man who made inquiries of Kerwin, the truckman, regarding the conveyance of the trunk. Of these, as yet, only Dr. Rosenzweig has been arrested, though his wife is kept under surveillance, and his servant girl and a lodger in his house are detained as witnesses. 
                     But all the facts that had as yet been brought to light pointed to Rosenzweig as the principal actor, and the rest as merely assistants in the effort to get rid of the body of the victim. 
                
                
                  MISTAKEN IDENTITY-STRANGE, VERY STRANGE. 
                  One of the strangest cases of mistaken identity that has ever been known, was the supposed recognition of the body of Miss Bowlsby as that of Figa Rosenzweig, and another case as horrible may yet be developed. The circumstances were as follows: An Israelitish merchant of Baxter street called on Capt. Kennedy at the Franklin street station, and said that from certain circumstances which had come to his knowledge he believed that the body of the young woman which was found in the trunk was that of Figa Rosenzweig, a niece of the doctor. The gentleman told Capt. Kennedy that the girl was well known to most of the Israelites of Baxter and Bayard streets. He gave so accurate a description of the girl that Capt. Kennedy became convinced that there was more in his assertion than idle talk. Capt. Kennedy immediately conferred with Inspector Walling, and Detective Eustis was detailed to assist in working up the case. The Captain and Detective Eustis accompanied by Mr. Price of 56 Baxter street, Mr. Bernstein of 66 Bayard street, Bernstein's wife and two daughters, Mr. Cohen of 73 Baxter, and Max Levy of 64 Baxter street, all of whom were intimately acquainted with the girl Figa, went to Bellevue. After a critical examination of8 the corpse, they all unhesitatingly declared it to be that of Figa Rosenzweig, and said that they were willing to swear to it. 
                
                
                  THE OLD, OLD STORY. 
                  The story, as told by those who were acquainted with the family, is that about one year ago Rosenzweig sent to Warsaw, Poland, money sufficient to pay the girl's passage to this country. When she arrived she went to live with Rosenzweig's mother in the basement of 98 Bayard street. At this place Rosenzweig owns a butcher shop, which is attended by his mother, who lives in rooms at the back of the shop. Some time ago the neighbors noticed that Rosenzweig was assiduous in his attentions to Figa, and before long the girl bore unmistakable signs of being encient. When questioned in relation to the matter, she said that Rosenzweig the father of her unborn babe. Four weeks ago yesterday Rosenzw called at his mother's house, and after conversing awhile, said that the basement was damp and unhealthy, and as Figa's health was delicate, he intended to take her home to his house, and keep her there until she was entirely recovered. 
                
                
                  GOING TO HER DEATH. 
                  Figa left the Bayard street house with him that same afternoon, and since that time has not been seen by any of the neighbors. Captain Kennedy, having heard that Hannah Goldwasser, an aunt of the girl, and step sister of Dr. Rosenzweig, lived at 450 Pearl street, conjectured that sho was the woman who accompanied the trunk to the depot, and bought the ticket for Chicago. Mrs. Goldwasser was arrested, and taken to the station house. The boy Potts and the truckman Pickett were sent for. On their arrival they both said that she was not the woman. Mrs. Goldwasser was much agitated, and told several contradictory stories. She said that four weeks ago Dr. Rosenzweig bought a ticket for Figa to return to Poland; that she accompanied the doctor and the girl to Hoboken, and saw her get on board a steamer, the name of which she does not know, and saw the steamer sail with the girl on board. 
                  The reader all this while must bear in mind that the detectives were working up the wrong case, under the supposition that the body of Miss A. A. Bowlsby then lying at the Morgue was that of Rosenzweig's niece, "Figa." 
                
                
                  THE HOUSE OF CRIME. 
                  The house on Second avenue, in which it is probable this dark deed was committed, and in which resides Dr. Rosenzweig and his family, is a three story and basement marble front house, about twelve feet in width by thirty deep. The main entrance is reached by a flight of ten marble steps leading from the sidewalk, and which are common to this and the adjoining tenement. Annexed is a diagram of the basement, in the front room of which, or dining-room, the trunk containing the body was standing when the truckman called for it.

                  THE UPPER FLOORS. 
                  The main or parlor floor is divided into three equal-sized rooms. The front door opens directly into the front room, which is furnished with imitation rosewood furniture upholstered with crimson satan damask. All the pieces are covered with crochetted tidies. The middle room is plainly and sparsely furnished. It is a mere hall, from which stairways lead to the basement and upper floors. The rear room is furnished with black walnut. A rosewood piano also stands in this room. On the mantel also stands a bust of General Grant. The rooms are separated by sliding doors with ground glass panels. The carpets of all the rooms are uniform, bein a heavy light-colored Brussels. The second floor is divided into two square rooms, front and rear, with a hallway, off of which is a bathroom and water-closet. The front room is occupied as the family dormitory, the Doctor, his wife, and the three younger children occupying it together. The rear room is used by Rosina Rosenzweig, the doctor's daughter, a girl of fourteen years. The third floor is divided the same as the second, save that the small closet corresponding with the bathroom below is used as a servant's sleeping room. Abram Seal, a peddler, of the some nationality as Rosenzweig, and a boarder, occupied the front room. The rear room was vacant. Seal is detained at the Twenty-second street station as a witness. 
                
                
                  A WATCH ON THE PREMISES. 
                  Two officers were placed in charge of the house on the Doctor's arrest, who kept up a strict surveillance, allowing access to none but those connected with the Police Department. Captain Cameron accompanied by Sergeants Frank Randall and Rooney, and Roundsman Keating, went to the house and instituted a thorough search, which brought to light evidence sufficient to prove, although the fact is denied by the prisoner, that Dr. Jacob Rosenzweig of 687 Second avenue, and Dr. Ascher of 3 Amity place, are one and the same person. 
                
                
                  THE UNDERTAKER'S STORY. 
                  My name is James F. Boyle, and I do business as an undertaker at 658 Second avenue. On the morning of Saturday the 26th, a man whom I now recognize as Dr. Jacob Rosenzweig came to my store. I was at the time conversing with my father. I turned and asked the doctor his business. He asked me how much it would cost to bury a woman, and then added that a servant girl of his had died. He said that she was very poor and only had $10, and that it did not matter to him how or where she was buried so that she was buried. I asked him what sort of a funeral he wanted. He said that he only wanted a hearse and coffin. He then asked if I could not take the body to my store, saying that it was not far off. I answered that I would only do this if he would furnish me with a certificate from the doctor who had attended the girl, and then I could get a permit from the Board of Health. In further conversation he said that the doctor who had attended the girl lived down town. Nothing further transpired, and he went away, as I supposed to get the doctor's certificate. He did not return, and I never saw him from that time until I saw him to-day in the cell. I was induced to come here and make this statement from what I read about the affair in the papers. 
                
                
                  AN INTERVIEW WITH ROSENZWEIG. 
                  Our reporter visited the prisoner Rosenzweig in his cell, and engaged him in a protracted conversation. He strenuously denied any connection with or knowledge of the crime of which he is charged, and attributes the truckman's recognition of him and his house to a mistake. He admits calling on the undertaker Boyle, but says he merely dropped in there by chance, and thought to "make one hand tickle the other" by offering the undertaker work in return for any chance practice that might be sent to him. He claims to have come to this country from Europe in 1864, since which time he has lived in various parts of the city. He says he was a regular allopathic physician in Poland, but on coming to this country he turned his attention to the eclectic system of medicine, and attended lectures for two years in that school of medicine in Philadelphia, though retaining his residence here. He denies any intimate acquaintance with Dr. Ascher, of Amity place, but claims that there is such a man, and that he knows him casually. Dr. Ascher's specialty is cancers and tumors, and he practises some in confidential cases. He does not judge Dr. Ascher's standing or ability, and when pressed on this point becomes petulant and refuses to answer. He is also easily irritated in regard to his diplomas, and refuses to answer questions about them. He claims Dr. Willard Parker as his friend, and boldly refers to him for his character and standing as a medical man. "Dr. Parker," he said, "has frequently consulted with me, and he would not meet me in consultation if I was not a competent and regular physician." The doctor also denies that he has ever been engaged in any other business than the practice of medicine. 
                
                
                  WHAT DR. PARKER SAYS. 
                  Our reporter then called on Dr. Willard Parker in regard to Rosenzweig's claims. Dr. Parker said that some time last year this man called on him and presented an official card, at the same time saying that his child was sick with diphtheria, and requested him (Dr. Parker) to call and see it. Rosenzweig was then living at 161 Thompson street. Dr. Parker called several times and ministered to his child out of professional courtesy. Subsequently he was called to see a patient in Macdougall street. On inquiring who the attending physician was, he was told it was Dr. Rosenzweig. As he knew nothing against Rosenzweig he obeyed the call. This is the extent of his professional or social acquaintance with the man. He has an indistinct recollection that when he called at Rosenzweig's house he saw Rosenzweig's professional card on the front of the house, and also one that his remembrance makes sound something like Ascher or Aker.

                  THE MAID SERVANT'S STORY. 
                  Warden Brennan had a long interview with Jane Johnson, the servant of Dr. Rosenzweig, in the Twenty-second street police station. He represented to her what trouble she would get herself into if she persisted in refusing to tell what she knew about the death of the young lady, and he offered to procure her immunity from punishment, to take the best of care of her during her illness (she has been pregnant seven months) to admit her to the hospital, and to provide for her afterward if she would make a clean breast of it. She was very much affected, burst into tears, and seizing the Warden's hands, she said that she would tell everything. She said she entered Rosenzweig's service on the first of May last, and went on with a long story, differing in no point from her former statements, except when she told of 
                
                
                  THE DEATH OF A WOMAN 
                  who came from Newburg, and entered Dr. Rosenzweig's house under the assumed name of Mary Carrol. She died on June 7, after giving birth to a living child, and was buried from the house at the expense of a man who used to visit her occasionally under pretence of being her husband. Thomas Carey was the undertaker (Carey afterward corroborated this story). The doctor certified that Mary died of dropsy. Jane and Mrs. Rosenzweig carried the child to the Sisters of Charity, where it is still. Jane positively denied that she knew anything about the present case, and affirmed with many protestations that she had told the truth. She appeared to be fully cognizant of what she was saying, and all efforts to elicit anything further from her proved abortive. 
                
                
                  DON'T KNOW FIGA ROSENZWEIG. 
                  Our reporter called upon Miss Johnson in the station-house, for the purpose of questioning her in regard to the story about Figa Rosenzweig, but she doggedly denied that the doctor ever had a niece. He was an only son, she said, and had never had a brother. Nothing further could be got from her, notwithstanding that the reporter represented her dangerous position in the strongest light, and explained to her how she might save herself by a full confession. 
                
                
                  VICTIM RECOGNIZED AT LAST-NOT FIGA ROSENZWEIG, BUT ALICE BOWLSBY. 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 BELLEVUE HOSPITAL, NEW YORK, Aug. 30, 1871. 
                                 Geo. W. Walling, Esq., Inspector Police. City New York.
                               
                              SIR: I have the honor to report that after three days' searching for some person to recognize the body of the unknown woman found in a trunk, and brought to the morgue on last Saturday evening from the Hudson River Railroad depot. I am finally rewarded by the remains being recognized by Dr. Theo. G. Kinne, of 163 Main street Paterson, N. J., and also by Dr. Joseph F. Parker, dentist, of the same number, as Miss Alice Bowlsby, of 43 West street, Paterson, N. J. She was visiting her aunt in Newark, N. J., in company with her mother, and left Newark on Wednesday on the 9.15 A.M. train for Paterson, by way of New York. Very respectfully yours, 
                              
                                 THOS. S. BRENNAN. Warden.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  This solution of the mystery of identification only adds to the obscurity the whole dark affair. How came this young woman in Dr. Rosenzweig's house? Who enticed her there? An entire new field for investigation is hereby opened up. And then, what has become of Figa Rosenzweig, the doctor's niece? How are the contradictory statements in regard to her, given below, to be reconciled? Are there other victims of this man's dark practices yet undiscovered? Who can tell? 
                
                
                  ESTABLISHED FACTS AGAINST ROSENZWEIG. 
                  Two damaging facts against the doctor have been established beyond the possibility of a doubt. The first is, that he called at the undertaker's shop of Boyle & Boylston, in Second avenue, at 9 o'clock in the morning of Saturday last, and endeavored to negotiate for the burial of a young woman, representing that she was his servant girl and poor. This transaction is established by the evidence of three witnesses, the credibility of either of whom cannot be assailed. The second fact is the employment of the truckman, Pickett, to take a trunk from the doctor's residence, which trunk was delivered to him from that residence by Rosenzweig in person, and was subsequently found to contain the corpse of the young woman. And as if to establish this fact beyond all peradventure, the truckman, on receiving the order to call for the trunk, entered the address in his memorandum book, as follows: 
                        687 Second avenue, JULIA SIDNEY.
                     
                   
                  This entry was made when the order was received, and solely for the purpose of guiding him to the place. No. 687 Second avenue was occupied only by the household of Rosenzweig, and the truckman further identifies Rosenzweig as the man who delivered the trunk to him. 
                
                
                  PERSISTENT IGNORANCE OF THE ACCUSED. 
                  Rosenzweig's household consisted of himself, his wife, his daughter Rosinetta, and three small children, the Jew peddler, Abram Seal, and the servant girl, Jane Johnson. Each and all of these parties strenuously deny any knowledge of the trunk or its contents, or of its delivery to the truckman, or any circumstance connected with it. The doctor, however, though at first disposed to equivocate, finally admitted, as he could not deny that he called at the undertaker's shop on Saturday morning, but persists in his denial of any conversation of the specific tenor alleged by the three witnesses of the visit. He maintains that he merely spoke of burials in a general way, his idea being that by impressing upon the undertaker he could give him employment from time to time, the undertaker might be led to send him patients. 
                  The doctor, who has hitherto most strenuously denied that any deaths had occurred at his house, was yesterday forced to admit that the girl called Mary Carrol, whom he had delivered of a child, did die there last June. He still denied, however, that she died in childbirth, but maintains that her malady was dropsy, as he certified at the time in order to secure a burial permit. 
                
                
                  ROSENZWEIG'S STORY OF HIS NIECE'S WHEREABOUTS. 
                  In regard to the girl Figa Rosenzweig, his reported niece, whose identity with the corpse was considered as established, the doctor told Capt. Cameron that he had detected her stealing money at his mother's in Bayard street, and had sent her to Poland several weeks since. He said that she was now in Poland, as he knew from letters he had received from the police of that country. When asked where these letters were, he said they were at his residence. Capt. Cameron immediately sent to the residence and made diligent search for all letters and papers it contained. Of these a great batch were found, but none of them confirm the doctor's story. There are no letters among them, either from Figa, from Polish police officers, or from any other source whatever alluding to the girl's arrival in Poland, or referring in any way to her. It will be seen from an interview with the doctor's wife and other female relatives, printed below, that their stories about this girl do not in anywise agree, a circumstance that tends to corroborate her alleged murder at the hands of these people. 
                
                
                  JANE JOHNSON'S CONTRADICTIONS. 
                  The girl Jane Johnson, who was detained by Captain Cameron, is a mystery in herself. She represents that she was born in Canada, of Catholic parents, but is herself a Protestant. She has been married, but her husband died of cholera in this city seven years ago. Since then she has lived at service. She is now, according to her own story, Seven months advanced toward maternity, but persistently refuses to same the father of her unborn child, merely saying that he is out West. She is about 28 years old, of good form and carriage, with remarkably soft, pleasing eyes, and attractive features. Her complexion, however, is coarse, and betrays her station. Our reporter who visited her understood her to say that she had lived with the Rosenzweig family only about a month ago; but in this the reporter may have been mistaken. To another reporter, however, she did positively say that she had lived there only three months, whereas she now admits that she has been there since May. After the disclosures were made on Tuesday evening regarding Figa Rosenzweig, a reporter was sent up to the stationhouse from this office expressly to interrogate her regarding Figa. To that reporter she positively denied any knowledge of such a person, and undertook to establish her assertion by a real or pretended knowledge of the doctor's family history and connections. Yesterday she denied having had any such conversation with the reporter, and admitted that 
                
                
                  SHE KNEW AND HAD OFTEN SEEN FIGA, 
                  usually at the house in Bayard street, and occasionally at the doctor's house. She would tell nothing more about her, insisting that she knew nothing, only she persisted that Figa never stayed at the doctor's house only as she called there from time to time. 
                  From all the developments in this strange and mysterious case, it being so evident that this girl, if at home last Saturday, must have had some knowledge of the trunk transaction, our reporter urged her to tell all she knew. But she persisted that she knew nothing. 
                
                
                  SEEKING LIGHT IN THE KITCHEN. 
                  Reporter.-Were you not at home on Saturday? 
                  Jane.-Yes, sir; I was at home. 
                  Reporter.-All day? 
                  Jane.-I might have been out half a dozen times of errands to the grocery, or something like that. 
                  Reporter.-How long were you gone from the house at any one time? 
                  Jane.-I can't tell how long. 
                  Reporter.-Were you gone an hour at any one time? 
                  Jane.-No, sir, I don't think I was. 
                  Reporter.-Were you gone half an hour 
                  Jane.-I can't exactly say. 
                  Reporter.-Where did you go that day? 
                  Jane.-I might have gone to the grocer's opposite, where we usually bought groceries, or sometimes I went around into Thirtieth street about the middle of the block, between Second and Third avenues. I know I went after milk soon after dinner to a place near First avenue on Thirty-ninth street. 
                  Reporter.-Were these all the visits you made out of the house durin that day? 
                  Jane.-Yes, sir. 
                  Reporter.-What time do you dine? 
                  Jane.-Between 12 and 1 o'clock. 
                  Reporter.-Then it must have been soon after 1 o'clock that you went for the milk? 
                  Jane.-About that time. 
                   
                  Reporter.-What were you doing that day? 
                  Jane.-Oh, I can't remember that. 
                  Reporter.-Well, usually you wash on Mondays, don't you? and another day you iron, and another day you have general sweeping, and so on; some particular work for each day? 
                  Jane.-Yes, sir. 
                  Reporter.-Well, can't you remember what you were doing last Saturday? 
                  Jane.-In the morning I made the beds. 
                  Reporter.-How many beds? 
                
                
                  THE FRIDAY NIGHT LODGERS AT ROSENZWEIG'S. 
                  Jane.-Let me see. I made Rosie's in the back room; Mrs. Rosenzweig always made her own in the front room; I made the bed in the front room on the top floor, where the young man slept; and I had my bed in the little closet-room in the middle of the house on the top floor. I used to sleep in the back room, but the bugs were so thick there they drove me out. 
                  Reporter.-Did you make no bed in the back room that day? 
                  Jane.-No, sir. 
                  Reporter.-Well, after you made the beds, what did you do? 
                  Jane.-I scrubbed the kitchen, and then I washed out the back yard. 
                
                
                  AN UNCERTAIN DINNER. 
                  Reporter.-Did you do this all before dinner? 
                  Jane.-I can't say about that. When I was busy, Rosie generally got the dinner. 
                  Reporter.-Did Rosie get the dinner that day? 
                  Jane.-I think so. 
                  Reporter.-Can't you remember? 
                  Jane.-I don't think there was any dinner got that day. The doctor don't always come home to dinner, and then we just fix something on the kitchen table. 
                  Reporter.-Was the doctor home that day? 
                  Jane.-I can't say for sure; no, I don't think he was. 
                  Reporter.-What makes you think he was not at home? 
                  Jane.-Well, he went out after breakfast. I remember, because I went to get a handkerchief out of my trunk behind the door in the dining-room, and he came through and pushed the door back against me. He said, "Excuse me; I didn't know you were there." I remember this because he very seldom speaks to me. I don't think he speaks to me once a week. 
                  Reporter.-Did he go out the basement door? 
                  Jane.-Yes, sir. He went right out after speaking to me. 
                  Reporter.-And he didn't come home to dinner? 
                   
                  Jane.-No, sir. Mrs. Rosenzweig was sick up stairs, and Rosie took her dinner up to her. 
                  Reporter.-Then the dinner table was not set in the dining-room that day? 
                  Jane.-No, sir. 
                  Reporter.-Did the doctor usually go out and in through the basement her? 
                  Jane.-Usually, though he sometimes went up the steps, and went in front door. 
                
                
                  WHAT THE GIRL MIGHT HAVE HEARD. 
                  Reporter.-If he had come in the basement door you would have known it, wouldn't you? 
                  Jane.-Not necessarily; he might have come in and I not heard him. 
                  Reporter.-Did he have a night key to that door? 
                  Jane.-No, sir; the door was not fastened; it is never fastened. Sometimes it is left unlocked all night. 
                  Reporter.-But, even then, you would have heard the door open and shut, wouldn't you? 
                  Jane.-Not if the kitchen door was shut. You know there is a hall leading from the dining-room door to the kitchen door. 
                  Reporter.-Yes. Were these doors shut that day? 
                  Jane.-I don't remember. 
                  Reporter.-If they had been shut you couldn't hear what was going on in the dining-room? 
                  Jane.-No, sir. 
                  Reporter.-Could you not hear people going up and down the basement stairs? 
                  Jane.-I don't think I could. 
                  Reporter.-Was Mrs. Rosenzweig down stairs that day? 
                  Jane.-She might have been down just for a little while at a time, don't know whether she was or not. 
                
                
                  WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN. 
                  Reporter.-Now, Jane, it is certain that a trunk, containing the dead body of a young woman, was taken out of that front basement at about 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. It is strange if you don't know anything about it. If you do know about it, you ought to tell it at once, or your persistence in seeking to conceal the fact may place you in a very bad predicament. Whether you know it or not, the trunk did go out. Now tell me honestly, whether you know anything about it or not. 
                  Jane.-If I was to die for it this minute I could say no differently. I know nothing about it. 
                  The reporter, as he could get nothing further from the girl, left her. Soon after, Warden Brennan called, and in consideration of her delicate
                      
                      
                        JANE JOHNSON, SERVANT TO "DR." JACOB ROSENZWEIG. A prominent witness, with a "story of her own." 
                        
                           Jane Johnson, Dienstmdchen des "Dr." Jacob Rosenzweig. Eine wichtige Zeugin, nebst einer "eigenen Erzhlung."
                         
                     
                      
                     attention, Captain Cameron committed her to his care, and she was removed to Bellevue Hospital, where she will be cared for. 
                
                
                  A DISCOVERY THAT BELIES THE GIRL'S STORY. 
                  But the measure of credibility that may be placed in her statements can be judged from the fact that in the wash-tub at which she was engaged when arrested, and which was left undisturbed for a few days, there was found a lady's white lawn handkerchief, marked with indelible ink, "A. A. Bowlsby," the name of the young lady from Paterson, showing that not only had the unfortunate one been in the house, but that her soiled garments were given to this girl to wash. Beside this fact, proving Miss Bowlsby's presence in the house with Kate or Jane Johnson's knowledge, there was also found upon the promises a blue silk scarf, which has been identified as one worn by Miss Bowlsby when she left Newark. Thus, even though the servant may explain away her pretended ignorance, there can no longer be a doubt that this young lady was made away with in that house, and, of course, by Dr. Rosenzweig in the practice of his unholy trade. 
                
                
                  HOW MANY MORE VICTIMS ARE THERE? 
                  But, having found the identity of this particular corpse, the child-slayer is not yet relieved from suspicion regarding his niece. 
                  Our reporter, widely known in Philadelphia as "Quizzing Gus," and who was sent by us to New York city expressly to "work up" this case visited Bayard street, the residence of Rosenzweig's mother. Sitting in the underground meat shop, he found Mrs. Leonora Rosenzweig, the doctor's wife, nursing her baby, five weeks old, Miss Rosinetta, the doctor's eldest daughter, Mrs. Rosenzweig, the doctor's mother, and another old Jewess. The doctor's three younger children were playing on the greasy floor of the butcher shop. When the reporter entered the place the elder members of the Rosenzweig family were engaged in an earnest conversation, which was immediately hushed. Asking for Mrs. Rosenzweig, both of the madams claimed that honor, and after making himself known, the following conversation ensued between the doctor's mother and the reporter. 
                  Reporter.-I suppose that you have seen the statement that the girl found in the trunk was Miss Figa Rosenzweig, a niece of the doctor, and that she formerly lived at this place. 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig (in imperfect English).-Yes, I see it all; but (excitedly) it is all a lie 
                
                
                  THE MOTHER'S ACCOUNT OF FIGA. 
                  Reporter.-When did Figa come to this country? 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig.-Figa's father and mother died in Poland, and when my husband, who is now dead, heard of it he sent for Figa's brother, Hyman, to come here; that was about one year and a half age. He came, and after he was here about six months he was taken sick with the dropsy and we sent him to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he died. My husband then sent for Figa and she arrived here about the time of the "Feast of Hannuccan;" that was about the latter part of last February. 
                  Reporter.-Did she live with you after her arrival? 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig.-Yes; she lived with me until about nine weeks ago when she left and went to live with her aunt, Mrs. Goldwasser, at 450 Pearl street. 
                  Reporter.-Why did she leave your house to live with Mrs. Goldwasser 
                
                
                  IMPUGNING THE HONESTY OF THE MISSING ONE. 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig.-That is a family matter which I have never spoken about, but I'll tell you the whole story, and you can then judge for yourself. When Figa lived with me I had a man working for me about the shop. His name was Carish Cohen, a countryman of mine. Well, about nine weeks ago, and just before Figa left me, I was robbed of $426 in money and about $350 worth of jewelry. I suspected that Carish Cohen was the thief, but he said he was innocent, and finally proved that he knew nothing about the robbery. Just about this time, Figa complained of being sick, and Mrs. Goldwasser came to my house one day and said to me. "You know that Figa's brother died with the dropsy, Figa is sick, and may be she'll die the same as her brother did. I am going to take her to my house to live." Figa went with Mrs. Goldwasser the next day. Figa came to see me every day until about four weeks ago. 
                
                
                  FIGA'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE. 
                  Then her visits ceased entirely. I did not know what was the matter, and one night I went to Mrs. Goldwasser's house and asked her where Figa was. She said, "I haven't seen Figa for several days. She is at your son's house. He came and took her away." I then went to my son's house in Second avenue; it was nearly 12 o'clock at night. I asked him for Figa. He told me he had not seen her for three weeks 
                  Reporter.-Have you any idea where Figa is now? 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig.-Two days after this Mrs. Goldwasser called at my house, and said that she had heard that Figa had gone to Poland. I asked her, "Where did she get money to buy her ticket with?" Her answer was, "I don't know where she got it, but Figa has got plenty of money." 
                  Reporter.-Do you think that Figa stole your money and jewels? 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig.-I didn't think so at first, but I am now certain, from her actions, that she was the thief, and divided with Mrs. Goldwasser. 
                  Reporter.-Was Figa enceinte when she left your house? 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig (emphatically)-No, sir; she had the dropsy 
                   
                  Reporter.-The neighbors say that your son was very attentive to Figa, and took her to the theatres, to balls, and carriage riding. Is this true? 
                
                
                  COVERING THE TRAIL. 
                  Mrs. Rosenzweig (smilingly).-No, sir; my son hated Figa because she made trouble between him and his father. Why, sir, my son wouldn't be seen on the street with Figa. You ought to see her; she looks like regular "sheeny." 
                  Just at this point in the conversation Miss Rosinetta addressed the reporter, and volunteered the following description of Figa: 
                  "She was short and very fat, with red hair a yard long, which she wore in two large braids down her back. Her hair, in fact, was so very red that we all called her 'Carrot.' She had black eyes, but one of them was much darker than the other. Her neck was perfectly beautiful. Her hands were short, fat, and very red. She had only half nails on her fingers. Her feet were very small-she wore No. 3 shoes. She spoke very little English. She was so fat that she had no figure; her shoulders and waist seemed to come together. As my grandmother has told you, She looks like a regular sheeny.'" 
                  To Mrs. Leonora Rosenzweig, the doctor's wife, our reporter addressed the question, "Is it true that a woman died in child-bed in your husband's house about three months ago?" 
                
                
                  STILL ANOTHER VICTIM. 
                  The doctor's wife (hesitatingly).-You mean the woman Mary-Hughes, I think her name was. Yes, she died in my house about three months ago. 
                  Reporter.-Was her husband with her when she died? 
                  The doctor's wife.-I suppose you mean George; he was not her husband. His name was Hughes, and he was Mary's brother-in-law. 
                  Reporter.-Did the baby live? 
                  The doctor's wife-Oh, yes; I kept it two or three weeks after the mother's death, and then my sevant girl, Jane Johnson, took it to the Sisters on Waverley Place. The baby was sickly, because the mother died with dropsy. She was in my house about three weeks, and was confined two weeks after she came there. I was sick, and didn't ask her where she lived; but she told me that she lived in the country. If you ask the undertaker who sent her body home you can find out where she came from. 
                  Reporter.-Did your husband attend her during her sickness? 
                  The doctor's wife.-He did, and was assisted by Dr. Rosenthal. 
                  Reporter.-Have you heard anything lately of the whereabouts of Figa? 
                   
                  The doctor's wife.-No; my husband wrote to the Burgomeister of the town in Poland as soon as he heard she had gone, and afterward telegraphed, but never received an answer. 
                  Reporter.-Are you acquainted with Dr. Cetlinski? 
                  The doctor's wife.-Oh, yes; the doctor often called at our house to see my husband. 
                  Reporter.-How long have you been married? 
                  The doctor's wife.-I was married to Dr. Rosenzweig in Warsaw, Poland, fifteen years ago. My parents are still living there; their name is Geflhaus. 
                  Letters are in possession of the police showing that Mrs. Rosenzweig's father's name is Phillips, and that he lives in Birmingham, England. This throws doubts on all her statements. 
                
                
                  FIGA'S NAME NOT ON THE PASSENGER LIST. 
                  Inspector Walling, with his detectives, made most untiring efforts to discover the whereabouts of the woman who accompanied the trunk to the depot, but thus far he had been baffled. The strap which the baggage man had sold to the woman, and which was placed around the trunk, has been resold by the baggage man, although orders were left to preserve it as evidence. Inquiries were made at the offices of the German steamships in this city and in Hoboken whether a ticket had been sold to a woman of the name of Figa Rosenzweig. A careful examination of the books for the past four months failed to reveal any such name. 
                
                
                  LAWYERS DISAGREE. 
                  Ex-Judge Sydney H. Stuart stated that the evidence already accumulated against Dr. Rosenzweig was sufficient to convict him, and that he would not assume the case for the defence for any amount. On the contrary Counsellor Howe, who has taken the case, yesterday told Rosenzweig that there was no case at all against him. 
                
                
                  THE CHILD-SLAYER'S PROFITS. 
                  Among the effects found in Rosenzweig's house were several bank books, showing deposits in different banks to the amount of several thousand dollars. Also, three lady's gold watches, besides the one worn by the doctor's wife, and a quantity of jewelry. 
                
                
                  THE FIGA ROSENZWEIG MYSTERY. 
                  The mystery attending the sudden disappearance of Miss Figa Rosenzweig is still unravelled, and circumstances strongly point to the fiend Rosenzweig as the person most intimately connected with the deep damnation of her taking off. The contradictory stories told by the doctor and the female members of his family, then the version of the affair as given by the servant girl, Jane Johnson, and Figa's aunt, Mrs. Goldwasser, of 450 Pearl street, all point with unerring finger towards Rosenzweig as the murderer of the girl Figa. Our reporter called on Mrs. Goldwasser at her residence, and asked her if she still persisted in the story should Capt. Kennedy, viz., that Figa had left for Poland four weeks ago with a ticket purchased for her by Dr. Rosenzweig. Mrs. Goldwasser said: 
                
                
                  THE AUNT'S VERSION. 
                  "When Figa came to my house to live she was always complaining of being sick, and I said she ought to go home to Poland. She said she had no money. I then went to Dr. Rosenzweig and asked him to buy a ticket for her. He said he would see her d-before he would give her one cent, and advised me to make her enter a house of ill-fame, saying it was an easy way of making money, and that Figa was a very pretty girl. I then went home and told Figa what he had said. She then became very angry, and said, 'I'll show him something: I'll make him give me money or anything else that I want. I've got a hold on him, and he dare not refuse me.' She then dressed herself and started, as she said, for the doctor's office. She returned in about an hour and showed me $50, which she said the doctor had given her. The next day she went out again, and on her return she showed me a ticket, which she said the doctor had bought for but." 
                  Reporter.-Was your husband present when Dr. Rosenzweig called at your house to see Figa? 
                  Mrs. Goldwasser (coloring).-My husband, about four years ago, got into bad company. A burglary was committed in Brooklyn. My husband was arrested as the guilty party, and sent to Sing Sing for ten years. I've got five children, and support them by peddling dry goods through the country. My oldest boy helps me by blacking boots and selling papers. 
                  Reporter.-Were you acquainted with Dr. Rosenzweig's family in Poland? 
                  Mrs. Goldwasser.-Oh yes, I knew them intimately. 
                  Reporter.-Have you ever heard that the doctor had any other cases of malpractice? 
                  Mrs. Goldwasser.-Yes I heard that he was the cause of the death of a young Jewess 17 years old, Miss Hester Tennelow, living with her mother in Pearl near Chatham street. She died about three weeks ago, but as I am not positive about the circumstances, you had better inquire of the neighbors, and they can tell you more. 
                
             
             
                
               THE TRIAL OF ROSENZWEIG. 
               THE SISTER AND MOTHER OF THE MURDERED GIRL IN COURT.-PRODUCTION OF THE HORRIBLE TRUNK. 
               THE trial of Jacob Rosenzweig, for causing the death of Alice Augusta Bowlsby, of Paterson, N. J., by means of an abortion, was commenced October 26, in the Court of General Sessions, before Recorder Hackett. Mr. William F. Howe, the prisoner's counsel, was early on hand. His junior associate sat beside him, while at the left hand side of both, the principal in the trial, 
                
                  ROSENZWEIG, 
                  surnamed the man with the colossal cranium, occupied a seat. District Attorney Garvin was in attendance, and sat composedly interweaving his fingers, while his able assistant, Algernon S. Sullivan, was leaning back on a chair, reflecting the light of his brilliant orbs on the frontispiece of his associate, Garvin. 
                  Recorder Hackett surveyed the entire scene from the elevation of the bench, and listened attentively as the District Attorney prepared to deliver his opening address to the jury, who were in their places shortly after the Court room was opened. The horrible trunk, in which was packed for transportation the remains of the unfortunate Miss Bowlsby, was brought into Court, and kept to be put in as evidence against the accused. It is an ordinary-sized trunk, and apparently almost new. It was tied round with a rope, the same as when its contents were inspected at the depot of the Hudson River Railroad. 
                  At a quarter past ten, ex-Judge Garvin arose and proceeded to address the twelve men sitting in judgment on the wretched prisoner. He briefly recapitulated the enormity of the crime charged, and stated to the jury what he expected to prove on the past of the people. The prosecution would prove that the deceased left her aunt's house in Newark on the 23d of August, 1871, and that she entered the dark, fearful den of the accused. They would also prove that she was never seen alive after entering this den. Her body was afterwards sent from the house in the trunk, then lying under the stenographer's desk, but none of her clothing was found upon it. They would be able to show by the medical testimony from what cause Miss Bowlsby died. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF MRS. BOWLSBY. 
                  Mrs. Bowlsby, the mother of the unfortunate Alice, was called as the first witness for the people. Witness briefly described the apparel of her daughter on the day she left to come to this city. After which she continued:-She also had a handkerchief with her, marked "A. Bowlsby," and a small basket containing some little trinkets; I never heard anything from or of my child after she left, until the body was recognized by Dr. Kenny at the Morgue; the deceased had a mole on the left side of her neck, and a vaccination on her left arm just above the elbow; on the left side of her jaw there was a scar caused from an ulcerated tooth which had broken off; there was also an eye tooth missing on the right side of her mouth. 
                  At the conclusion of this testimony, the counsel for Rosenzweig proceeded to cross-examine 
                  The Witness.-I did not see the handkerchief my daughter took away with her on the 23d of August. I knew all her handkerchiefs from the mark of "A. Bowlsby;" she wore a false bosom, or pads, at the time of leaving; the bosom was the same as very many ladies wear; Alice was the eldest of my children; her age was twenty-five. 
                  In reply to the District Attorney.-There was a young gentleman who used to keep company with my daughter; his name was Mr. Walter Conklin; he died on a Thursday; I don't remember the date; he committed suicide by shooting himself; he used to frequently visit the house; I do not know whether they were engaged or not. 
                
                
                  MISS CARRIE BOWLSBY, 
                  the sister of the deceased, generally corroborated the testimony given by her mother. She recognized the pads shown as the ones made by her sister out of material belonging to a dress. 
                
                
                  JANE JOHNSON, THE SERVANT GIRL OF THE PRISONER, 
                  was placed next on the stand.-Have lived with Dr. Rosenzweig; I was doing housework in the doctor's house; about the time of the trunk trouble, the parties living in the house were, the prisoner and his wife, her four children and myself; there was a young girl also; she was not living there, but she used to be there a great deal; her name was Nettie; I don't know her last name; the deceased came there with the prisoner on the 23d inst.; I saw her going up stairs; the Doctor, I think, went up with her; I never saw her after; I know that the woman called Nettie knew that the woman in white, the deceased was in the house. 
                  The trunk was here shown. The witness said she either saw that trunk, or one like it, in the kitchen previous to the visit of the deceased. I heard that the lady in white was a patient of the Doctor's I heard it from Rosie, the prisoner's daughter; the trunk that looked like the one shown in Court belonged to the woman Nettie, who so often visited the house. 
                
                
                  WILLIAM PICKETT, 
                  of No. 471 First Avenue, the carman who was hired to carry the trunk to the Hudson River depot, testified that on Saturday, the 26th of August, he took a trunk from the house of the prisoner; a young woman came to his stand and wanted him to take a trunk from Thirty-seventh street and Second Avenue to the Hudson River depot; he took the trunk from 687 Second Avenue; this same woman, accompanied by a boy, whose name the afterwards heard was Potts, met him at the depot when he arrived there with the trunk; a man opened the door, and I told him that I called for a trunk to take to Twenty-ninth street; the man then took hold of one end and helped to lift the trunk on the cart; that is the trunk (pointing to the one in court), and that man (pointing to the prisoner, Rosenzweig) is the man that helped me carry the trunk; he is the man; he never spoke word; when we arrived at the depot, the boy assisted me to set the trunk on the counter to get it checked, afterwards the woman helped also; she looked at the lock on the trunk, and said she was afraid it would not hold; a strap was then put round it, for which the woman paid a dollar; I then went away. The witness recognized a boy shown him in Court as the one who helped him with the trunk at the depot. 
                  The witness was cross-examined at considerable length, but it failed to shake his evidence. 
                
                
                  ALEXANDER POTTS, 
                  the boy who assisted in carrying the trunk into the depot, was placed on the stand. He testified as fellows:-I live at 429 Eighth Avenue; I carry baggage for a living, and remember being on Thirtieth street on Saturday, the 26th of August; I met a woman man on that day; she came in a cab; I recognize the carman; the woman asked me if I knew anything about the trains; she came ten minutes before the man with the trunk; she bought a ticket for Chicago at half-past four; I would know the trunk I helped to carry to the depot if saw it. 
                  Q. Is that the trunk? (the trunk in Court was here shown the witness.) A. Yes, sir, that is the trunk I saw; the baggage man checked the trunk for Chicago, and gave her a ticket for the same place; I afterwards saw the trunk opened, and saw a naked dead body; the body was squeezed in the trunk; the body as lying on its side and doubled up. 
                
                
                  PETER MURPHY, 
                  police officer, sworn:-The baggage master called my attention to the trunk lying outside on the platform; we opened the trunk and found the body of a woman wrapped in some blankets and other things; I reported at the station house, and then delivered the body at Bellevue Hospital. 
                
                
                  THOMAS S. BRENNAN. 
                  Warden in Bellevue Hospital, identified the trunk as the one that was brought to the dead house; Drs. Henry and Parker examined the body twice; they had a photograph of the deceased. 
                
                
                  DR. JOSEPH F. PARKER 
                  was the next witness. He said he was a dentist at Paterson, knew Mrs. Bowlsby, and accompanied Dr. Kenny to the Morgue, when they identified the body as being that of Miss Bowlsby; he saw the mark of vaccination, the mole and the cicatrix formed by an ulcerated tooth on the right side of the lower jaw; he found the eye tooth gone, broken off, which he had been about two months before in the mouth of Miss Bowlsby, whose dentist the witness had been for five years. 
                
                
                  JAMES F. BOYD, 
                  an undertaker, doing business at 336 East Thirty-fifth street, testified that on the Saturday morning before the body was found at the depot, the prisoner, Rosenzweig, came to him and said that a servant girl of his had died, and asked how much it would cost to bury her; witness asked him where she was, and the prisoner replied, "Not far away from here," but he did not state where; he said she was very poor, and had about $10; the prisoner asked him if he could take the body of this girl to his store, and he told him that he could not; that he (the prisoner) would first have to get a certificate from the doctor; the prisoner said the doctor lived away down town: he went out, and said he would call again. 
                
                
                  OFFICER LARUE 
                  testified that he went Pickett, the carman, to Rosenzweig's house in search of the girl who had charge of the trunk at the depot, but could not find her; on Wednesday, the 30th of August, the officer searched for clothing, and found in a stationary wash-tub in the back basement of the prisoner's house a handkerchief marked "A. A. Bowlsby," with a lot of children's clothing, and ladies' wearing apparel; Sergeant Randall found a blue sash in a bureau drawer up stairs, and also some jewelry-two ladies' watches, chains, breastpins, and rings-which were returned to Mrs. Rosenzweig. 
                
                
                  OFFICER RANDALL 
                  testified that he found a blue sash, and also the false bosom, which he marked at the time; the bosom he found in a barrel of old clothing in the kitchen; part of a bloody chemise and skirt were found in the cellar, covered over with dirt. 
                
                
                  DR. JOSEPH CUSHMAN 
                  testified that he made a post-mortem examination of the body of Alice Augusta Bowlsby, at the Morgue, on Sunday, the 27th of August; the body was 5 feet 3 inches long, and well developed; the hair was blonde and the eyes blue; there were no external marks of violence. In the Doctor's opinion, death resulted from metro-peritonitis, caused by abortion. 
                
                
                  THE DEFENCE. 
                  William F. Howe, the indefatigable counsel for Rosenzweig, then proceeded in an able and exhaustive argument to open the case for the defence, and in an argument of great length said that the crime imputed to the prisoner was fiendish in the extreme, and might well be hurled back against those who had charged him with a fiendish crime-a crime so full of revolting circumstances that humanity must shrink at it aghast. 
                
                
                  MEDICAL TESTIMONY. 
                  Drs. Garrish and Parker were called for the defence, and gave testimony upon more technical questions on obstetrics, that served very little to elucidate the main point at issue. 
                
                
                  ANOTHER MRS. BOWLSBY. 
                  The next witness called for the defence was a demure-looking female, aged about thirty, who said her name was Mrs. Cornelia Bowlsby; she lived in Myrtle avenue, Brooklyn; I am married and have six children; one of the my children is named Anna Martini Bowlsby; she is now married; she is sick now and not here, but was here on Monday; she had 
                
                
                  A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF 
                  marked; I visited you (counsel) at your office recently, and afterwards went to the Districts Attorney's office to see the handkerchief marked "A. M. Bowlsby; "I would know that handkerchief. 
                  The handkerchief was here shown the witness, who pronounced it the same as the one she had seen in the District Attorney's office. 
                  It is somewhat dirtier than when I first saw it; I should say that 
                
                
                  THE LETTERS ON THE CORNER OF THAT HANDKERCHIEF 
                  were A. M., with the M partially rubbed out, also a B, which is partially obscured; I don't know how my daughter marked her handkerchiefs; we visited Dr. Rosenzweig's on the 7th of August, the Thursday before my daughter was married; we had some wine at the doctor's house; my daughter got some wine on her gloves and took them off and wiped her hand with her handkerchief; we read of the finding of the handkerchief in the newspapers, and my daughter then said 
                
                
                  SHE WOULD BET 
                  the handkerchief spoken of was hers. 
                  Cross-examined-My husband's given name is William Henry; we are not related to the Bowlsbys of Jersey; we never heard of them previous to this trial; I did not see my daughter marking her handkerchief; I did not make known what I knew about 
                
                
                  THIS HANDKERCHIEF 
                  until Mrs. Rosenzweig came to my house; that was, I think, about three weeks ago; I did not give her any satisfaction; I did not notice particularly, what kind of a handkerchief my daughter had at the Rosenweig's only, that it was a very common one. (Several questions were asked of the witness, and the latter endeavored to equivocate. In fact she persistently, wilfully affected to misunderstand the queries pat to her.) A man came to our house in Brooklyn just before my daughter got married, and wanted to sell some stencil plates; he marked one handkerchief for my daughter-marked it A. M. Bowlsby; he marked it in the hall; I was in the basement at the time; I know he marked it; this was the only one that was marked. 
                
                
                  TESTIMONY OF JACOB COHEN. 
                  Mr. Cohen examined:-I was sick on the Saturday the trunk was found at the railroad depot; I sent for Dr. Rosenzweig, who came to me at about half-past twelve; he sat two or three hours with me, as I was very sick. 
                  Cross examined:-I do not recollect what date it was, but I know two or three days afterwards the doctor was arrested; I am a cigar and cigarette manufacturer; I was sick at my house, which is some distance from Mr. Rosenzweig's house; the doctor was with me nearly all the time he staid, with the exception of going back and forth to the store in front. 
                  After some unimportant testimony as to the reputation and character of the prisoner, 
                
                
                  ROSENZWEIG WAS PUT UPON THE STAND. 
                  He testified as follows:-I am a physician; I reside at 687 Second avenue; I graduated in Warsaw; I came to this country in 1865; I established my business in this country at 33 Bayard street; I know the Bowlsbys of Brooklyn; I have known them about six or seven months; I never did know the Bowlsbys of Paterson; I have heard all the testimony that has been given in this Court; my wife and daughter are in Court; never saw the girl Nellie Willis now in Court, at No. 3 Amity place, within a year or two, and never performed an abortion upon her; he also emphatically stated that the undertaker's testimony was all false; that he never said anything about a servant girl being dead near by; he did not know a woman named Nettie staying in his house on Friday or Saturday nights, and when Jane Johnson swore to that she testified to what was not true. Before he left the stand Rosenzweig said, he never performed an abortion at any place in the city of New York, nor did he know of any woman being brought to his house, dead or alive, during the week of the alleged occurrence who had any operation performed upon her. 
                  The counsel, at a quarter past ten, proceeded to address the jury on behalf of the accused. He (the counsel) would show, when he came to direct the attention of the jury to the evidence, that the District Attorney had failed completely to prove anything against his client. They (the defence) contended, first, 
                
                
                  THE BODY TAKEN TO THE MORGUE 
                  was not that of Alice Augusta Bowlsby. The jury must have in their minds some doubt as to the identity of the body found in the trunk with that of the missing girl, the murdered Alice A. Bowlsby. The jury must have a doubt of this, because the mother of the deceased herself had. The counsel continued at considerable length, endeavoring to interpret the testimony in a favorable light for the wretched man who was his client, but the effort was a total failure. He 
                
                
                  CONCLUDED 
                  with a Tombs Police Court appeal to the jury to have pity on the wife and children of the prisoner, whom the jury would deprive of a natural protector, etc., if they concluded to convict. He concluded at a quarter to twelve, at which time District Attorney Garvin arose to argue the case on behalf of the people. 
                
                
                  AFTERNOON PROCEEDINGS. 
                  District Attorney Garvin commenced his address by depicting in elegant language the enormity of the crime with which the prisoner stood charged. After this he ably recapitulated the bits of evidence the together made so conclusive the guilt of Rosenzweig. He explained to the jury the temptations to which young girls, who have an inheritance of beauty which is more 
                
                
                  DANGEROUS TO THEIR PEACE OF MIND 
                  afterward than anything else they may possess, as subjected day by day until they arrive at woman hood, and after they arrive at that period, they meet one whom they love. They are importuned, caressed and in a moment of thoughtlessness they fall-then ruin is consummated. The vile seducer has no responsibility, his victim 
                
                
                  DARE NOT DENOUNCE HIM 
                  because by so doing she lays herself open to the cold criticism and sarcasm of an unsympathetic world. She dare not talk to her father. She cannot to her mother. She will not divulge the secret grief that is gnawing at her heart to her sister, and her brother if she has one, is not approachable. Her seduce has forsaken her, and walks erect among his fellow men in comparative security. What then is 
                
                
                  THE POOR VICTIM 
                  to do? To whom will she fly for relief? She take up a newspaper, runs her eyes up one column an down another. The advertisements of such fiends to the prisoner arrest her attention, stating that his business is the relieving girls of their troubles in this way. She goes to him in a moment of desperation, and is lost! Her cold corpse is the result. How many 
                
                
                  SLEEPLESS NIGHTS 
                  testify to the agony of mind of the seduced girl previous to taking the fatal determination of consulting these hell-hounds called abortionists; when she knows and calculates with horror that every day brings her nearer shame? O, what a fate is this How many unfortunate, erring women have died lingering agonizing deaths at the hands of these Dr. Aschers, who sticks a sign out in 
                
                
                  A DARK ALLEY, 
                  and allures the miserable into his lair? This man practices abortions in Amity place as Dr. Aschers he keeps a place in Second avenue as Dr. Rosenzweig for a respectable business. If he is discovered in his vile doings, it is Dr. Ascher that is arrested, and no Dr. Rosenzweig. Does not this speak for itself? 
                  The learned gentleman then 
                
                
                  WENT ON TO ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE, 
                  and draw deductions applicable to the points of the case. 
                  When Judge Garvin concluded, Recorder Hackett charged the jury. The counsel for Rosenzweig read several points which he requested the Recorder to incorporate in his charge, which was done with three exceptions. 
                
                
                  THE CHARGE 
                  of his Honor was an elaborte and lengthy one, and thoroughly exhaustive. The case was given to the jury at precisely nine minutes after two o'clock, who retired to deliberate, and did not return up to three o'clock. 
                
                
                  THE VERDICT. 
                  The jury returned at twenty minutes to four, with a verdict of guilty of manslaughter in the second degree. Recorder Hackett then sentenced him to the State Prison at hard labor for seven years. He regretted that the penalty was not death.
