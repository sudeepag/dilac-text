CHAPTER I.--THE BROTHERS. IT was the year of the Great Rebellion. Not great simply considered in itself; for it was comprised in but a brief space of time, and was marked and terminated by one decisive battle. The union, too, of the tribes seemed perfectly re- stored and more than ever cemented in the next reign by the erection of that magnificent temple which was not only the glory of that age, but the wonder of all succeeding ones. And yet scarcely had the king who built it been laid in the tomb when there arose a convulsion that rent in twain the Jewish nation, never again to be reunited. When the fact is noted that the tribes who engaged in this second and final revolt were identical in name and number with those who took part in the first, with but a single and doubtful exception, it is easy to see that the rebellion of Absalom against his father and his king was but the seed of the deadly upas that slowly matured, till its poisonous breath blasted the land which was the "glory of tall lands." This year, so memorable in Jewish history, was the thirty-second of King David's reign, and the sixty-third of his life. Absalom, his favorite son, who took such a prominent part in its stirring events, was thirty years of age; and the little Soloman, who was destined afterwards to occupy such an elevated place in the world's estimation, was entering on his tenth summer. The remaining children of the King, with the exception of Adonijah, have left behind them only the slim record of their names. Like Jacob of old, David among so many sons had only one daughter, and the coincidence still fur- ther holds that each suffered from a like misfortune. A wonderment why two of the King's sons should have been named Elishama, and two Eliphalet, and the thought that the first of each name might have died before the second I      8          ATHALIAH. so named were born, is all that the list of names suggests to the mind. From the palace of David on its commanding height of Mount Zion, while yet its inmates were suink in deep repose, there came forth a soldier who had spent the night on duty in the guard chamber. fHe stood for a few moments gazing on the eastern horizon, which was fast losing its gray hues in the rosy flush of the coming day. Then, instead of goinga to his home, which was not far distant, he descended the mount and pursued his way towards the Review Gate in the eastern wall of the city. His heavy tread is not the only sound breaking the still- ness of early morning, for mingling with it is the sound of other footfalls, light and rapid. Not greater the contrast between the bearing of these men who are about to meet by accident as they enter from opposite directions the street running straight to the Review Gate, than in their characters and purposes in life. The one, though not far past forty, looks upon the world gloomily as having little in store for him; while the other, just entering on manhood-sunlight in his heart and on his path, sees a future cloudless! As they. meet face to face they recognize each other. "Reuben!" "Benaiah!" The brothers-for such is their relationship-cordially embrace, and from the face of the elder'vanishes the stern and gloomy expression which had grown to be habitual. "Benaiah! this is a pleasant surprise. I thought thee with the army many miles away." "Two days ago I was. I reached Jerusalem, after a hard ride, yesterday." "Thou hast leave of absence then?" i "Yes, till after the Feast of the Passover." "Joab, I am glad to see, is softening towards thee." "No, Reuben; the great Commander is to me as flinty as ever." "But he gave thee this leave of absence! That is some- thing." "Only through the intervention of another, after having first refused me. Besides, Reuben, this leave of absence was given me to perform a duty. I was sent to Jerusalem by Joab as bearer of tidings to the King."   :I            THE BROTHERS.         9 "Ah! my brave brother, I see it all now. The day before yesterday the bearer of the first tidings of the late battle reached -here, and among other things mention was made of thy valor in defending the banner of thy thousand when attacked by several of the enemy at once. Joab could do no less than confer on thee the honor he has." "Thou art wrong, Reuben. I had already been rewarded more than such a simple act of duty deserved; for with the incentive I had, it would have been dastardly to have yielded that banner up unless my life went with it!" So much enthusiasm flashed forth in these words that Reuben turned an enquiring look towards his brother, which brought a deeper tinge to Benaiah's cheek. Fortunately, an interruption now occurred which served to some extent to cover the young soldier'sFconfusion. They had reached the Review Gate, which at this early hour was closed. Reuben's acquaintance with the officer of the gate-guard secured them a speedy egress. Crossing the brook Kidron, they com- menced the ascent of the Hill of Olives. "Benaiah, I am completely in the dark," said Reuben, resuming the conversation. "Pray enlighten me." "To do so, Reuben, I must go back to the day of the late battle. At its close, Joab hastily reviewed the army which was to encamp for the night, partly on the field that had been the scene of the bloody contest, and partly within the walls of the city which lay adjacent, and which had fallen to us as the prize of victory. He rode rapidly along the lines, for the sun was fast sinking into the Great Sea, and but little light remained to the dying day. As he passed my company he reined in his horse, and fix- ing his keen eyes on the battle-soiled banner I held, called me from the ranks. He praised me for what he was pleased to call my skill and unflinching bravery, and then in the name of the King presented me with a costly sword, which he took from his armor-bearer, who was in attendance upon him. Thou wilt say, Reuben, that this was a reward more than I deserved, and yet I was mad enough to ask for more." "Not at all, Benaiah! Joab ought to have promoted thee at once." "He said something about it,? indifferently replied Be- naiah, " but added that it was unwise to take from my   10 -         ATHALAH. guardianship a banner I had proved myself so worthy to defend." "All very pretty! But to have been made captain of a hundred brave comrades would have been more to the purpose than carrying about with thee a piece of silk." "A piece of silk! Reuben, thou little knowest how I prize that banner!" Then, to cover his confusion consequent upon these un- guarded words, Benaiah hastened to add: "No, Reuben; never was water more welcome to weary wanderer over desert wilds than were to me these words of commendation from the lips of Joab. And yet in my in- fatuation I asked for something more. I was very desirous of visiting Jerusalem; and knowing that a second bearer of tidings with more detailed accounts than the first carried was to be sent the next day to the King, I had the pre- sumption to go to Joab and reqtest the appointment for myself. The stern repulse I met \with, though it angered me at the moment, I confess was no nore than I deserved. There was justice in Joab's taunt, though it galled me, that I ought to be content with the honor conferred on me in the presence of the whole army, and not come to him to beg for more." -"And yet thy request was granted, and by Joab. Who was the intercessor who changed the heart of the obdurate commander? For thou hast said there was one." "Yes, and therein lies a mystery which unwittingly to unfold might cost me my life, which I much prefer retaining just at present." The brothers by this time had ascended some distance up the Hill of Olives, and now turned as by a common impulse to gaze at the beautiful city that lay stretched out below them. It was the point from which Jerusalem could be seen at the best advantage, and the hour was none the less favorable, for the sun was just rising, and its first beams were tipping with golden light each tree-top, roof, and pin- nacle. There was a bright, kindling glance in Benaiah's dark eyes as they roved from point to point over the city, seek- ing some known object to guide them to one chosen spot; but before he was quite successful in his search, Reuben re- called him by saying:   Ii'          THE BROTHERS.         " "Come, Benaiah, and sit down on ths grassy knoll. I am impatient to hear of this mystery."} "At the moment I was leaving J ab's presence," said Benaiah, continuing his narrative, "a cdrtain that concealed the interior apartment of the tent was withdrawn, and in the opening thus formed appeared a female of elegant and graceful mien. She was veiled, but the arm that held back the hanging of the tent was but partially concealed by its falling drapery of rich lace, and was beautifully rounded and white as orient pearl. I glanced at Joab, who seemed surprised at her appearance. "' Is not my lord Joab too severe towards this valiant youth?'  "The tone in which these words were uttered were strangely sweet. Joab was about replying, when the arm, which had pointed towards me, was suddenly'raised as if commanding silence. The motion was obeyed. She then resumed in the same measured musical tones she had used at first, addressing me: "' Thou wouldst go to Jerusalem as bearer of tidings to the King. I will plead with my lord Joab for thee. Jt were well that thou madest ready, that if I succeed, thy depar- ture may be as immediate as thy wishes prompt.' "Expressing my gratitude by a lowly inclination, I with- drew, little doubting that my desire would now be granted. In an hour all was prepared, and I rode hither fast as horse could carry me." "Strange indeed! Who can this woman be? I thought Joab was wholly a soldier and above such -weakness.' There was a pause of a few moments-Benaiah perhaps continuing the search over the house-tops of Jerusalem which his brother had interrupted, while Reuben was think- ing of several things suggested by the late conversation that were not very clear to him. He had noticed the en- thusiasm with which Benaiah had twice spoken of the ban- ner he bore in battle, and his consequent confusion, and had contrasted the recklessness of life he avowed when its safety was involved, and his after assertion that his life at present was too precious to him to be lightly imperiled. There was something misty, too, in the ardent desire his brother had shown to visit Jerusalem, for he knew he was charmed with a soldier's life and preferred the tent in the  12Y5         ATHALIAH. field to the ceiled house in the city. Above all, there was a change in Benaiah's manner, which, though Reuben could hardly describe to himself, he none the less felt. He half divined the secret "cause, but was not content that anything should mar the perfect confidence his younger brother had always reposed in him. The questions he put, then, were from no mere idle curiosity. Though his heart was dead to the many endearments of social life, there lay nestled in it, as flowers sometimes grow in rocky clefts, a love that was ever fresh and fragrant, and all the more lasting and tender that in it was comprised the fostering affection of the father- else childless. "What time, Benaiah, didst thou reach Jerusalem yester- day?" "About mid-day." "Didst meet with any delay in gaining access to the King?" "I did not see the King, but received an order to report to Ahithophel." "Was the interview a lengthy one?" "No, it lasted scarcely half an hour." "Small recompense for thy hurried journey hither! But why wert thou so desirous of visiting the royal city? If only to see the King, I pity thy disappointment." "Reuben, canst thou ask that, after our long separa- tion?" 1"Perhaps not, but I can ask why thou didst not seek me yesterday after thy mission was fulfilled." Reuben's keen searching look brought the blood to Be- naiah's face. Kindly taking his embarrassed brother's hand, he added: "There is solhe one in Jerusalem dearer to thy heart than I am. May I ask who she is?" "Certainly, Reuben, I will tell thee all. I intended to have done so without being asked, but thou art so skeptical about woman's love that I was half afi'aid to do so." "Whatever, my brother, is of such importance to thee, becomes an object of first interest to me. Come, and as thou sayest, tell me all." The manner in which these words were uttered, invited the fullest confidence, and so the younger told the elder bro- ther the story of that grand passion which first had lodgment   THE BROTHERS.         13 in Eden, and will be found in the last survivors of the hu- man race. They had first met in Gilo. She was the sister of war- riors; the banner Benaiah bore in battle had been embroid- ered by her fair hands, and it was on the occasion of its presentation to him by her, as was the custom of the time, that they had become acquainted with each other. In sim- pie language the young warrior told of her beauties of mind and heart and person; of the rapid conquest she had made, of his hopes andfears, till all uncertainty was at last buried in the depths of their mutually avowed affection. "And the name and family of this dear" one who is to make thy future life a golden holiday?" inquired Reuben. "Miriam, the granddaughter of Ahithophel the King's counsellor." Reuben sprang to his feet as if a serpent had appeared to him. "Not a sister of Bathsheba the Queen!" excitedly ex- claimed Reuben, seemingly imploring an answer in the negative. Benaiah, surprised at this sudden agitation of his brother, rose from the bank on which he had been reclining, and coldly answered, "Not her sister, but the daughter of Bathsheba's brother. There certainly can be no dishonor in such relationship; or if there were, it could leave no taint on Miriam. She must ever remain the purest and loveliest of women." "Pardon me, Benaiah! I did not intend to hurt thy feel- ings, and I will explain to thee the reason of my sudden forgetfulness-for it was nothing else. The story is not a pleasant one, and its recital, while it will make thee wiser in thy knowledge of men, will perhaps render thee less happy. In exchange for the confidence of thy bright ex- perience, I must give one of deeds of treachery and vio- lence. They occurred nearly a score of years ago, and yet I see them as plainly as if but one sun had set since they were perpetrated. This, Benaiah, is the secret cause of the gloom and depression of spirit in me that thy presence ever has not always had the power to dispel. Sit near me, Be- naiah!" continued Reuben, stretching out his hand, which Benaiah clasped; " what I am about to say can never lessen our affection for each other. Be assured! of the dark     1ATHALIAII. deeds to which I have alluded I am guiltless. It is not re- morse that has darkened my life." Reuben feared from the expression on his brother's face that he thought him implicated in the crimes of which he had spoken. Such fear was, however, groundless. Benaiah had a good degree of general confidence- in all men, but in Reuben it was unbounded. The look which had attracted his brother's notice was the fear one might feel at the sight of clouds and the sound of distant thunder, who had never witnessed a storm. CHAPTER II. THE AVENGER OF BLOOD. "TWELVE years ago,? commenced Reuben, "while thou wert in Egypt\ pursuing thy studies under the care of our dear mother's Sister, I was fighting the battles of our coun- try and of our Lord. At the time to which I allude, a large army under the command of the renowned Joab was be- sieging the city of Rabbah of Ammon. "cAmong the prominent officers of the host was Uriah. He was not a Jew, but a Hittite, a people on whom many years ago our sacred historian, Moses, cast an odium by re- cording that when Esau took to wife two of the daughters of Heth, it was a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah. And that she told Isaac that she was weary of her life be- cause of them, and. that if Jacob followed his brother's ex- ample, her life would be no good to her. I remind thee of these facts, Benaiah, to show how sometimes a goodly tree will grow out of uncongenial soil. "When Uriah first came among us, we regarded him with distrust; yet he soon, by the undaunted bravery and simplicity of his character, won our respect; and when David conferred on him the high honor of ranking as one of his worthies, none envied him, for each felt how well he had deserved the position the King had given him. "I am ashamed to confess that I was the first to jeer at him on account of his nation, and the last to acknowledge                    /   X          THE AVENGER OF BLOOD,       15 his worth; but when I did so, it was more than respect that I felt for him. It was the beginnings of an affection passings, the love of woman. He never answered taunt with taunt. He was always even-tempered, self-sacrificinlg, and keenly alive to the calls of duty. "He married Bathsheba, the beautiful daughter of Eliam, his comrade among the King's worthies. Her grandfather wAs Ahithophel, the King's counsellor. All were rejoiced at his good fortune in making so brilliant an alliance, and I among the rest, little dreaming what a terrible mockery time would prove our congratulations! "One afternoon, as I was sitting with Uriah at the en- trance of his tent, our attention was suddenly attracted by the rapid approach of a horseman, whose passage through our encampment we noticed was attended by no little ex- citement among the soldiers and their officers. We soon learned he was a messenger from King David, who was in Jerusalem, to our commander Joab. Our camp life had grown so monotonous by many days of inactivity, that there was much curiosity among the officers who had joined us as to the purport of this message sent by the King. "One suggested that it was an order for an immediate assault on the city of Rabbath of Ammon, before whose walls we lay. Another, that we were to strike our tents and seek new and easier conquests. "By this time the royal messenger had entered Joab's tent, over which floated the standard of the tribe of Ju- dah. "Scarcely had he done so when one of Joab's officers issued from the tent and came towards the spot where we were gathered. Expectation was at its height when we saw that Uriah's tent was the point of destination. We silently awaited further developments. The formal duty of the officer proved to be a command that Uriah would pro- ceed to the tent of the commander-in-chief. He added the information that the King's messenger had brought a letter that appeared to surprise Joab,'and that the order for Uriah to come to him had been the immediate result. "Uriah, though the one chiefly interested, did, not share in our surprise at the summons.  He, with us, had won- dered what the coming of the royal messenger might mean. As soon as it resolved itself into an act of duty in which   16  ,        ATHALIAH. he was concerned, all his thoughts seemed to be simply to obey it. "We were not long in suspense as to what this new de- velopment of the affair might grow to. Hardly had Uriah entered Joab's tent when he re-appeared again. What he told us was in keeping with the whole transaction--sudden, brief, and startling. He was to go to Jerusalem. King David had sent for him. "Our congratulations were hearty and sincere, for not one of us doubted but that some new distinction awaited him. As his nearest friend I went with him into his tent, where he made hasty preparations for his journey. I shall never forget, Benaiah, his parting words as we cordially em- braced. ' Whatever good or ill happens to me, Reuben, re- member we are always brothers.'" There was a pause of a few moments, and Benaiah looked enquiringly at his brother. He saw on his features the same stern, gloomy expression he had chased away when he firs greeted him that morning. He had often wondered why his brother was so kind and gentle towards him, while ordinarily he was so grave and inflexible to others. Was the mystery of these two differing natures to be solved now? Wh n Reuben again resumed his narrative, he spoke rapidly, as if the recital were a painful one and he was de- sirous of ending it as soon as practicable. "W hat I am now to relate, though I was not an eye- witness of it, is as true in every particular as if I had seen it and now tell thee of it. "O Uriah's arrival in Jerusalem, he immediately sought the presence of the King. David enquired of him how Joab did, and how the army prospered, and what progress had been made in the siege. He then gave him permission to go down to his house, to refreshhimself after his journey, but that first he must partake of a mess of meat which the King had given orders should be prepared for him. "He partook of the repast, but he went not down to his house, though it was near, to visit his beautiful wife, Bath- sheba, as the King had given him permission to do, but spent the night with his former comrades in the guard- chamber.         . "The next day the King sent for Uriah and enquired of him why he had not gone to his house to rest himself after   THE AVENGER OF BLOOD.        17 his journey. Mark well, Benaiah, the answer he gave. He made no boast of it; far from it, but told it to me with all simplicity in answer to my close questioning, for my suspicions were aroused, so jealous is love for the welfare of its cherished objects. The purport of his answer to the King was this: the Holy Ark and the soldiers of Israel and Judah were abiding in tents; that even Joab and the servants of the King were encamped in the open fields. Should he then go to his house and eat and drink and lie with his wife, when the duties and self-denials of a soldier rested upon him even as they did upon them? No, not as thy soul liveth, O King! "David, in answer to this, told Uriah that he would re- quire him to stay another day in Jerusalem, and that on the morrow he might depart. He is invited to the royal banquet. Rich viands and rare wines are offered him by the King. Fearing no snare, he freely partakes. After the feast with all its passion-inspiring influence fresh upon him, he still seeks the hard couch of the soldier, turning his eyes away from the soft allurements of his home. "The temptation proving unavailing, Uriah is sent back to the army, bearing with him a letter from the King to Joab. Soon after, an attack on the city of Rabbah was or- ganized, and we naturally supposed that this was the im- port of the letter Uriah brought with him. The assault was to be made by Uriah's company on the best defended portion of the city walls. Thou knowest, Benaiah, it is the duty of the soldier not to question, but to obey. This might only have been intended to cover an attack at a more assailable point. "I went with Uriah. As if in proud defiance, a body of the Ammonites issued from the gate towards which we were advancing and engaged us. Foot by foot we drove them back. Numbers fell on either side. At length they gave way, turned, and fled. Raising a shout of triumph we pur- sued them to the very walls. Then fell on us a shower of arrows and missiles. Uriah with strong arm and dauntless heart urged on his men by his example more than by his words. He was ever in the thickest of the fray, and I kept by his side. Dark forebodings filled my mind. I feared treachery was lurking in our rear. If so, I thought it bet- ter to meet death at once at the hands of an open foe."   18          ATHALIAU. Reuben paused a second time in his narrative. By the trembling of his voice, Benaiah knew he had ceased speak- ing only to gain strength to tell his bitter story with a man's firmness. He said nothing, but simply pressed his brother's hand, which he still held, in token of his sympathy and in- terest.  "Benaiah, I have but little else to tell, and yet how much! Uriah, in his impetuous bravery, fought his way to the gate, which was still partly open to admit the retreat- ing Ammonites. A large stone hurled from the walls struck him, and he fell crushed beneath it. I stooped to raise him. He had just life enough left to breathe ( Reu- ben-the King-my-,' but death snatched from the un- worthy wife the honor of a last mention of that god-like soul. Then sounded the trumpet for a recall. I heeded it not. It was death I sought, not safety. Again and again it sounded. An idea flashed across my mind. I would live -live to know the full extent of this satanic treachery and dipping my hands in Uriah's blood, I swore on that field of carnage to avenge him! "How I learned the contents of the letter which King David sent to Joab by the hands of Uriah, it matters not, but this was its language, whrd for word: "' Set ye Uriah in the fore-front of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.' This, Benaiah, was the reward this saintly King of ours gave to the most devoted and valiant heart in all his king- dom." Benaiah shuddered as he listened to this terrible conclu- sion of his brother's recital. The interest of the narrative had drawn him from his own affairs, and for the time he had quite forgotten his new-born love for Miriam. But now came the reflection that she was related to Bathsheba the Queen, and that it was against her that his brother's vow of vengeance must be directed, for the King's person was sa cred, and, besides, Reuben continued to serve him. Was, then, this love for Miriam, that had made life such a very Paradise, to become an insurmountable barrier between him and his brother? Reuben seemed to divine the nature of his brother' thoughts, and hastened to reassure him. "Benaiah, fear not! I am no longer the blood-avenger   ;l4        THE AVENGER OF BLOOD.       19 Another has assumed the office, and if I act it is only as his servant." "Another? Thou surprisest me! Had-Uriah then one of near kindred acquainted with this dreadful secret?" "No. The avenger is not human. It is the Lord! Be- naiah, after the first storm of contending passions had sub- sided, I reflected. The King was anointed. God had raised him above all punishment from men, therefore he was the more accountable to God. In this matter I looked upon the Highest as the avenger of blood, and resolved to pa- tiently wait. How time has justified the truth of my reflec- tions. The King committed adultery with Bathsheba. The King's son Ammon violates his sister Tamar. The King treacherously murdered Uriah after endeavoring to make him the cloak of his wife's dishonor. The King's son -his princely and favorite son Absalom, with like treach- ery murders his brother Ammon. Thus incest and fratri- cide blast the King's declining years! Uriah! thou art avenged! And still the end is not yet!" A few moments of silence intervened, each immersed in thought, which, though of a different nature, produced a like effect on the brothers. At length Reuben exclaimed, and in lighter tones, though it was easy to see at the cost of some effort: "But enough, Benaiah, of this gloomy recital! It is time we returned to the city. Of course thou wilt breakfast with us. Sarah will be glad to see thee." This reminded Benaiah that he had not once enquired for his sister-in-law; and to add to his confusion he was obliged to decline Reuben's very natural and cordial invitation. "Certainly I ought to, dear brother, and should do so with sincere pleasure, but the past evening I made an en- gagement to breakfast with some brother officers, think- ing thou wouldst be on duty at the palace this morning." "Make no excuses. How long art thou to remain in Jeru- salem?" "Until the Court leaves it for Gibeon for the celebration of the Passover Feast. I am to join my company there." Conversing about various matters of interest they at length reached Reuben's house. To his invitation to come in and rest even but for a few moments, Benaiah pleaded that he was already behind  ^BOt     ATHALIAII. 'his time. He begged his brother to remember him affec- tionately to Sarah, and, promising to call very soon, the rothers separated. Benaiah, re-assured by his brother's conversation and man- ner towards him, walked gaily on, his heart full of happi- ness. From an upper window of Reuben's house, through an aperture formed by the partial withdrawal of a curtain, a woman gazed on the retreating form of the handsome young ensign-bearer. She had not yet reached thirty, and was beautiful in face and form. Soon, the object on which her eyes were so fondly, long- ingly fixed, passed from her sight. She stood for a few moments longer, as if some interest still clung to the scene from which he had disappeared. Then a sigh escaped her parted lips and she retired from the window. This woman was Reuben's wife! CHAPTER IIL ABSALOM AT WORK. WHEN Benaiah told his brother he was engaged to par- take of the morning meal with some of his brother officers, he omitted to mention that they were the brothers of Miri- am, and that his betrothed was also to be one of the party, for it was towards the house of Ahithophel that he was now gladly wending his way. This reticence on Benaiah's part was not the result of any lack of candor, or want of confidence in his elder brother's warm and fostering affection. The terrible disclosures made by Reuben had so shaken him, that he naturally avoided any allusion that might recall them; and while he would have scorned to tell an untruth: he only told such a portion of what was really true as suited the emergencies of the case. (Such a dealing out of a portion of the truth when the recipient thinks he is getting the whole, in a very strict court might be considered as a false pretence). The family of Ahithophel consisted of his three grand- f   ABSALOM AT WORK.         21 children, the offspring of a favorite son, who, unlike his brother Eliam, preferred the civil to the military life. Too. close application to his duties as the assistant of his father, coupled with the early loss of a beloved wife, to whom he was devotedly attached, sapped the strength and vigor of that subtle thing called " life," and so just as the birds were singing and the grass growing in the early springtime, he was laid by the side of the dear one, who had only waited for him while six moons had waxed and waned. The three little ones, orphaned by these sad events, were taken by Ahithophel as his own, and no children bereaved of their natural protectors could have had a more judicious counsellor. The wisdom for which he was proverbial-for he was the Solomon of David's reign-recognized the impor- tance of early and promptly shaping the means to the ends. The stock was good, for when thele is so mulch moral har-- mony in the lives and loves of the parents, we scarcely look for discord in the being of the children. And thus Adin and Helem arrived at manhood with mind and body thor- oughly educated, while clustering around, adorning and beautifying the solid structure, grew with delicate yet hardy life the graces and affections of the heart-the rich inheritance left them by their parents. And what of Miriam? the dark-haired, blue-eyed Jew- ish maiden, whom her mother had asked God for some score of years agone as a special gift, now that the father's pride had been gratified by the advent of two beautiful boys. And when God gave'the daughter, but took the mother, the heart of that mother mayhap passed into the being of her child; for never maiden matured more pure, more ten- der, more Eve-like ere the fall, than Miriam. And though so richly endowed, the years through which her life had passed had brought such treasures, that when Benaiah met her for the first time at Ahithophel's house in Giloh, and she had placed into his hand the banner her deli- cate fingers had so richly embroidered, she was a heroine in the highest, noblest sense of the word. It is the songs of a nation that mould the people's heart, only so far as they embody its traditions. And what were the traditions of the Jewish nation? Had ever people such narratives of implicit truth to fire the heart, or nerve the hand in action? Abraham! the mountain top, rising to-   22          ATHALIAH. wards heaven and talking with God! Isaac! the gentle, the noble, the refined! Jacob! the man of errors, anxieties, and troubles, but also of perseverance, skill and indom- itable energy-the real worker among this grand trinity of worthies-the father of the twelve sons, who were the heads of a great nation! Moses! whose life of six-score years were equally divided between the courtier, the shepherd, the leader and law-giver of a nation of nigh three million souls, who one day were slaves-the next finds the waters of the Red Sea rolling back that they might pass dry-shod, and then surging over the pursuing hosts of Pharaoh, discomfiting and destroying their enemies. Then comes the gentler story of the manna, dispensed each day by a Father's hand, just as the dew each morning is allotted to all, but with the dew to these chosen children of God came the bread that sustained their lives. Water, too, follows them for forty years through the wilderness like a ministering angel. Then, the great penance undergone, the hour of triumph draws near. The rushing, turbulent spring current of Jor- dan is stayed, and across the firm, solid bed of the river, tread the feet of six hundred thousand mailed warriors. But not before this mighty array do the walls of Jericho yield. God toppled them over with his finger, to teach his people at the commencement of their career that their strength lay only in an implicit trust in him, and unwaver- ing okLdience to his commands. Then come a host of giants. After Moses, Joshua, Jeph- thah, Gideon, Eli, who, though weak through his fatherly affection, was strong in his duty towards God; Samuel, the Moses of the age in which he lived; Saul and then David, the shepherd-poet, the warrior, the King! This is but a meagre narrative of the food on which the soul of Miriam grew and thrived. Her life from its begin- ning had been nearly commensurate with the reign of David, and inwoven in the meshes of her being was the brilliant woof of the virtuous and romantic life of this valiant, war- like monarch, who was also the sweet Psalmist of Israel. Thus the present and the past joined to imbue her being with those lofty aspirations that gave strength and stability to her character, which, in a less heroic age, might have been lacking in one naturally so loving and gentle.   ei   ABSALOM     AT WOREK.       23 Perhaps there is no such joyous meeting-place for the young and hopeful as the breakfast-table. The day is then as fresh and young as themselves. All is anticipation. Towards the day's close, it is retrospective; and to youth, how much brighter is what may be in the future, than what has really passed. The table was spread in the inner court of the house, for the temperature admitted of this arrangement, and when Benaiah arrived he found Miriam and her brothers waiting for him. Parrying as well as he was able the attacks of Helem, who laughingly insisted on knowing what strong inducement could have kept him from joining such desirable company five minutes earlier than he did, for that was only the length of time they had been waiting, they approached the table. Early as it was, there was no lack of fresh topics of con- versation. Adin and Helem had both been out for a walk, and had met with an incident that appeared of much inter- est to the former, for he was more of an actor in it than his brother had been. "Benaiah," commenced Adin, when they were fairly arranged at the table, "I wish thou hadst been with Helem and myself this morning." "I do not see why he was not," interrupted Helem, " he must have slipped away before it was light. But, Benaiah, thou canst have an opportunity of telling thy experience, when Adin relates his wonderful story." Benaiah shuddered when he thought what that experience had been, and how its narrative, as it was told him, would blanch the roseate tints on the cheeks of thefir maiden who reclined near him, for she had a reverence1 for King David that was wellnigh enthusiastic.  ] Oh! it is not so wonderful, but I think it will be of in- terest," resumed Adin, "that is, if Helem will let me tell it in my own way. As we neared the western wall of the city, just about sunrise, we saw rapidly aproaching, along the street leading to the Valley Gate, a splendidly equipped and handsomely mounted body of about fifty men, led (for it was easy to recognize him, even at the distance we were) ...by Prince Absalom. He was dressed with much elegance; his long luxuriant hair was sprinkled with gold dust, which  24          ATHALIAH. sparkled in the sunlight, and altogether his appearance was very noble and striking. I do not think he noticed us as he passed, but if he had, and had still gone on without rec- ognizing us, I would have thought nothing of it, for till an hour ago I always thought him very distant and haughty." "Yes, Benaiah!" said Helem, "thou oughtest to have heard how Adin took the Prince off after he had passed us. 'A pretty retinue that for a son who has been banished the kingdom and only lately restored to his father's favor! The King himself never makes such a display as that.' And yet now he thinks Absalom the prince of princes, simply for a few soft words, as near as I can make out, that he graciously poured into Adin's thirsty ear." "Helem,"retorted - Adin, " if thou hadst not been so dazed in looking at the horse thou wentst in such rapture about afterwards, thou wouldst have found I had reason for changing my opinion of the Prince." "He certainly has boldness and daring enough," said Be- naiah, " that exploit of his in burning Joab's field of barley proves that no one else in the kingdom would have had the hardihood to do it." "That was his way of inviting Joab to come and see him," replied Helem, " a novel style of invitation." "But if King David," urged Miriam, " has pardoned him and restored him to favor, I do not think we ought to judge him." At this moment Rachel,-a sewing-maid who had been waiting on them during the progress of the meal, entered the court and told Helem that Ethni, the son of Rebekah, was waiting in the vestibule to speak to him. "Sure enough!" exclaimed the light-hearted youth, "I promised to meet him this morning, but Adin's eloquence has quite made me forget it." Before leaving the court, however, he went up to Miriam and stooping over her whispered something to her with a half-serious, half-comic manner. A deep blush suffused the face of his sister, noticing which, he gaily laughed and left them. Benaiah, too, noticed the blush, but did not laugh. He noted more than the careless brother had done: that his communication, whatever it might be, had given Miriam pain.   Xi'i Il        ABSALOM AT WORK.         25 After this Adin had 'but listless auditors. Miriam's thought seemed to be elsewhere than with the narrative and Benaiah was wondering who Ethni was. He was not in the army, he thought. In fact, he had never before heard even the name mentioned. But Adin's enthusiasm was enough for all three and blind to their but half-concealed indifference, he went on to relate, that when Helem and he had reached the gate, they found that the cavalcade had halted, and that Absalom had dismounted. Quite a group surrounded him, with whom he was affably conversing. Upon noticing Adin he rapidly advanced to meet him, and actually embraced him, and kissed him. Hlelem had turned away to look at and admire the beautiful horse before the Prince had seen them. His words were as kind and condescending as his manner. lHe alluded to Adin's near relationship to/ the Queen, and to the fact that he was mostly engaged in personal attend- ance at the palace. "We of the Court ought to know each other better," were his gracious words at parting. This was the substance of Adin's narrative. At this point he was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Helem, his eyes beaming with delight. "Oh! Benaiah! Miriam! Adin! come and look at the horse Prince Absalom has just sent me, begging me to do him the honor of accepting it. What a fool I made of my- self this morning! Adin, thou art right. Absalom is the prince of princes. It is not the gift so much, but his kindness in sending it to me, after my disrespect to him this morning." T'he hangings of an apartment opening into the court were slowly withdrawn, and Ahithophel the King's counsel- lor entered. His step was slow, not from infirmity of age, but from that dignity his eminence as the King's most valued adviser bestowed upon him. Miriam hastened to meet him. "We missed thee at our morning repast, dear father," she said, with the confidence of a loved and favored child. "I ate with the King this morning, dear daughter." He turned to the young men, who were standing, and now bowed with deep respect as he saluted them. 2  26         BATHALIAEI. "Benaiah, I have happy tidings for thee and our dear Miriam, whose near relationship to the Queen, Bathsheba, made it necessary to gain the King's permission to your nuptials. This consent I obtained this morning. At a suitable time the ceremony of betrothal shall take place." Benaiah hastened forward and received from Ahitho- phel the fair, trembling hand of Miriam. -As if by one impulse they sank on their knees before the wise and venera- ble counsellor of the King, who, laying his hands on their heads, gave them the Jewish father's blessing. There was a decided change in Ahithophel's tones as he addressed Helem. "What reply hast thou made to Absalom for the present he has just sent thee?" "None as yet, my father. The soldier who brought the horse still waits without." "Tell him, then" replied Ahithophel, in slow, firm tones, "to say to the Prince that thou servest the King, and can receive Kingly presents from him alone. And, Adin, has Absalom given thee aught else than fair words and smiles?" "Nothing, my father." Benaiah!" proceeded Ahithophel with more of kindly feeling in his voice, " thou wilt one day be closely allied to us. Ye are three young valiant spirits. The King needs such now-may need them more hereafter. Remember, then, what I say to you. Beware of Absalom. He who loves him cannot love the King, and he who serves him must be a traitor to the King and country." "My father! may I speak?" replied Adin, with much respect. "1Say on." "This morning Prince Absalom turned from me at the gate to give advice and promises- of assistance to a poor qld man, who had walked fifty miles for justice, and had been waiting a week with none to hear his cause. "I know all this and much more," was Ahithophel's re- ply. "Let what is said suffice. Ye have to ride far to- Say in the King's service. Come with me to the palace, that ye may be made acquainted with the nature of you mission." Silently Adin and Helem followed Ahithophel-not in a spirit of servility, but of willing, loving obedience. It was   II : -  ABSALOM AT WORK.         27 not the custom of that age for the child to be wiser than the parent. And thus the lovers were left alone. Mingling with the soft plashing of the fountain falling in its marble basin near which they sat, the low tender tones of mutual love and confidence were lost to all ears save their own. Though they seemed only to have one heart in common, so perfect was the harmony of their thoughts and aspira- tions, yet only four moons ago they had been entire stran- gers. How much, then, they had to tell of their previous lives, that now looked to them so imperfect and incomplete, till the grand hour they had met and. loved each other. Benaiah depicted his life in Egypt, and when he told Mi- riam the respect 'and deference in which the Israelite was there regarded, her deep blue eyes kindled with enthusiasm and gratitude, when she reflected that once their ancestors had been Egypt's slaves. And when her gallant lover spoke of the marches, the encampments, the battles, that had marked his soldier life, though she had heard many a like account from her two brothers and their friends, yet how different it all seemed now; what a life, a light, a charm was in the story as it fell from Benaiah's lips! And Miriam told of her gentler life, all of its little inci- dents, of her friends, her pursuits and pleasures, of her Hi anxieties and griefs-for what stream, however pure and limpid it may flow, will not some time be shadowed by a passing cloud? And thus Benaiah learned that Ethni had been the com- panion of her early childhood, and her friend ever since, I though he gleaned from the guileless words of his affianced i that the son of Rebekah had never been a formal suitor for her hand, yet he felt sure that it was from no lack of desire to obtain her, but want of encouragement, that had deterred hin, till suddenly he saw all chance cut off. For Benaiah -conjectured that the interview between Helem and Ethni that very morning had just revealed to the latter that Mi- riam was beyond his reach. Oh! happy hours, laden with the perfumed breath of pure and guileless love, are there no chains that will stay your onward course? Alas! the happiest moments are the fleetest footed. But though ye hasten away, ye are not     28          ATHALIAH. lost! God will garner up these precious hours, that his sorrowing ones may again behold them in a brighter and better state of being. CHAPTER IV. MOTHER AND SON. THE occasion of the engagement of Ethni to call on Helem was accidental and seemingly of little importance to the latter, while to the former it pointed out the road of his future life, which, once taken, must be pursued to the bitter end, unless a strong will, influenced by better impulses or a restraining power, should lure him into happier and better paths. They were friends of about the same age, and the same rank in life. The only apparent difference, that of their pursuits-the one civil, the other military-seemed rather to cement their friendship than to divide it. On Helem's part this amity was the white light of a frank, outspoken nature, untinged by any other ray than that which sprang from a sunny heart; while in Ethni it caught all the hues that mingle, or flash out individually in the great master passion of a man's life-love. Remove Miriam from the position, and Ethni and Helem's friendship would not have been called into being. The day previous to the events recorded in the preced- ing chapters, the two friends had taken an early morning walk. The topics of conversation were various; had Ethni  had his choice they would have all mingled into one- Miriam. Ethni's pride Lade him avoid approaching the alluring subject, and so he generally waited till Helem, who devot- edly loved his fair, gentle sister, took it up of his own ac- cord. He did so on this bright, beautiful, bracing morning, with a terrible suddenness that made Ethni's heart feel as if plunged in the snow of Lebanon. "Ethni, have I told thee that Miriam met, during her late visitto Giloh,which our father's brother Eliam is making   MOTHER AND SON.        29 his place of residence during the organization of a new company of one thousand, authorized by Joab, a young offi- cer in the army called Benaiah? He made such a mark in- the last battle with the Philistines, that Joab presented him with a sword in the presence of the whole army. And I believe, from little indications I have seen, that my dear sis- ter is very much interested in him. I have no objections, I am sure, for I like the brave ensign-bearer." "Is he noble?" "In heart, soul, and body, yes. Whether his ancestors were called so I never thought to enquire, but I believe not." A little hope this to Ethni, but oh! how little! "'But would the King allow Miriam, the cousin of his queen Bathsheba, to wed aught else?" "I do not imagine he would refuse if my father Ahith- ophel asked him. Besides, David can make Benaiah's true nobility so in name." "Is this officer-ensign-bearer, I think thou calledst him- in Jerusalem?" "No, he is with the army under Joab." Later in the day, Helem met Ethni in the street. "Ethni! Benaiah, whom we were speaking of this morn- ing, arrived at noon as bearer of tidings to the King from Joab. I would take thee to the house and introduce thee, but dost know that I have left it under the impression that I was considerably in the way? I fancy the affair is pretty well understood," and Helem gayly patted his friend's shoulder. What heavy blows the careless Helem had given in an- other way! "But where wast going?" continued Helem, utterly un- mindful of the tempest he had raised in Ethni's heart. "To-to"-hesitatingly answered Ethni, "to Jotham, for authority for the scribe Raham to copy the sixty-ninth psalm for my mother." "Dost know, Ethni, that sometimes I wish that my lot in life had been cast as thine is? That is, I wish it after I have had an hour's converse with Miriam. She so. imbues my heart with a desire to participate in the past glories of our nation, that I feel we are pigmies compared to the giants of earlier ages, and that it is about as well to while away life     -1 X 1** J L * fi ^ in the study and contemplation of our glorious history, as to try and make but a poor addition to it." "And yet she lov'd a soldier!" This with a suddenness that startled Helem. "Oh! yes!" he replied; " and she always seems to love me more, that I am a soldier. For if ever I hint to her any idea of abandoning the profession, a new light kindles in her eye, and she appears to me like a young and beautiful Deb- orah, for dost know that I think that that heroine ances- tress of ours was neither the one nor the other?" Ethni, though better acquainted with the past history of the nation than the young warrior who was assisting in its continuation, did not give his ideas on the lack of youth and beauty in the justly renowned wife of Lapidoth. His heart, mind, soul, everything that makes up life, was cen- tered in Miriam. His possession of her might have put in jeopardy her peace--his lack of that possession wrecked his own, and made his love not the sun's warmth, but the vol- cano's blasting fires. He could hear no more, and yet   thirsted to know all. "Helem, I must away! I will see thee in the morning."  "But Adin has challenged me for an early walk. Wilt join us? perhaps Benaiah will go with us." "Too early, by far! I shall be up late to-night. I will see thee on thy return." He did see Helem. The whispered words into Miriam's ears, that had caused the blush and brought instinctive pain into her sensitive heart, were, "I'll tell Ethni what a gallant lover thou hast!" These words were not repeated to Ethni, for during the conversation that the pride of the one and the carelessness of the other made commonplace, Prince Absalom's present arrived. When they again encountered each other, Ethni was still in the vestibule, apparently interested in a survey of the Va horse, of Egyptian breed, and as Helem hurriedly took   i leave of him, after dismissing the soldier who had brought i the present in the words his grandfather had put in his  - mouth, he whispered to Ethni, as a mere matter of intelli- i gence,                          ? "It is all settled. King David has given his consent. The C betrothal will take place soon. Of course thou wilt be there." 1^   MOTHER AND SON.       Yes, all is settled as far as the happy lovers go, around whose path lays all that is bright, beautiful, and serene. But what of the dark tempest raging in Ethni's breast? Will that subside? Will the sun come out anrid fling over those dark clouds the bow of peace? In the bewilderment of this sudden crushing out of his hopes, he instinctively turned with a vague yearning towards home and the mother that made that home all it was. He found her in an apartment huntg with blue tapestry, and which was her favorite place of resort for*reading or meditation. Upon her son's entrance, Rebekah laid aside the roll of parchment she had been reading, and motioned Ethni to a seat beside her. Though past forty, she was still a beauti- ful woman, but it was a type of beauty, that won for its possessor admlration, but not love. Her"-eye, though lus- trous, wore generally a keen, searching look; the brow, though smooth and fair as alabaster, appeared,)too, as hard, and the mouth, though finely formed, was firm, and seldom wreathed with smiles. But there are smiles there now, and a softened light in the dark eyes as she welcomes her only son, and with an outhurst of tenderness not usual with her she draws him to her, pillowing his head upon her breast. What frenzy seizes Ethni, that he tears himself from an embrace so loving, as if a sudden danger lay in it? Did that embrace, so tender, bring before his mind another scene that might even then be transpiring, in which Miriam and Benaiah were the actors? For a moment he stands before his mother, pale and trembling. The proud woman looked up amazed. "Ethni, my son! Why treat thy mother thus?" On the revulsion of his first bitter feeling came back the love and tenderness he bore her, and he sank at his mother's feet.  'iSMother, dear mother, forgive thy son! I am wretched, unhappy, mad!" This submission, though so earnest, failed to satisfy the haughty Rebekah. Ethni had never before thwarted her wishes, but to spurn her affection, even though for a mo- ment, was an offence not so easily atoned for. She waited, cold and impassive, for an explanation of this strange con- duct of her son.     Thus repulsed, Ethni, who inherited all his mother's pride, rose to his feet, and without uttering a word left the apart- ment. Ah  had Rebekah known what that turning, away from her involved, how quickly and lovingly would she have clasped that bowed head to her breast. Confidence would have followed such ready forgiveness. The mother would have shared the disappointment of her son, and thus lightened its burden. TheE golden opportunity, so precious to both, was but for a moment. Rebekah's pride prevented her from grasping it, and it passed from her reach for ever. Scarcely had he left the room, when a servant announced to him that a woman was waiting without who desired an interview. "Who is she?" demanded Ethni. "I know not, my lord Ethni. She gave me no name, but from her appearance I should judge her to be an Arab soothsayer." "I want none of her mummeries here," sternly replied Ethni, " drive her from the door." The servant departed, but soon returned to Ethni, who was now in his own apartment. "Pardon, my lord, but this woman insists on giving thee this," and he handed Ethni an ivory tablet, on which had been hastily written in Arabic these words: "Thou hast been thwarted in thy love. If thou wouldst triumph over thy rival and secure thy heart's desire, admit me." Ethni's curiosity was awakened, and, after a little hesita- tion, he consented to see the woman. In a few moments she appeared before him. Her gar- ments were coarse, but clean and neatly made. Her fea- tures were regular, her complexion a reddish brown, her eyes keen and restless, and, like her hair, black as the raven's wing. Her step was light and springy, and her attitude easy. In manner she was self-possessed and not devoid of a certain natural dignity. Instead of speaking she fixed on Ethni a searching gaze, as if desirous of studying his character in his face. He submitted to this inspection for a moment and then haucght- ily demanded, "Who art thou?"   i             MOTHER AND SON.        33 (I    "One who wouldst serve thee," was the calm reply. "Let me know the purpose that has brought thee here, and then begone," angrily rejoined Ethni, for the cool, col- i    lected manner of the Arab woman exasperated him. I' I obtained the favor of this interview, my lord Ethni, after thou hadst ordered me to be driven from the door," was the unmoved reply. 1     u[) "Well, what then?" "My acquaintance with circumstances that occurred this morning secured me admission. Wouldst have further    proof of my knowledge and ability to serve thee?" "Wilt convey this boasted knowledge by means of an apparition?" scornfully enquired Ethni. "I will," rapidly answered the woman, in clear, thrilling tones. " i e!" and advancing towards Ethni she laidfone hand on his arm, and with the other outstretched, pointed towards the further extremity of the apartment, which lay in shadow. The movement was so rapid, the change in the Arab's manner was so sudden, that Ethni, taken by surprise, did not 1    withdraw from the woman's touch. "See! There is a room with silken draperies of green and Cut   gold. It has luxurious cushions strewn around upon its delicately inlaid floor of ivory and rich woods. The air that floats through it bears on its wings the odors of rare :t   flowers, and the cooling musical breath of gently falling waters. On a pile of cushions of deep crimson reclines a. i--!  beautiful maiden. Oh! how beautiful! See that dark luxuriant hair, inwoven with pearls, the transparent skin, showing the fountains of rosy bounding life! Look at those :ii::-, eyes, so deep, so soft, so melting; those lips, so dewy with j    the freshness of a young and loving heart-that rounded    form, the very perfection of budding, blossoming beauty. But she is not alone. See at her side that young and :   handsome officer.  How well his uniform becomes him! In his strong hand is dallying the delicate star-gemmed fin- gers of the maiden. How lovingly she smiles upon him. Listen! he speaks! 'I pity poor Ethni!'" "Enough of this mummery!" fiercely exclaimed Ethni, starting to his feet. "Leave me! Begone!" "What need!" replied the woman, in unmoved tones. "Thou wouldst send for me again, for I tell thee I can put     34          ATHALIA1. in thy hands the power to crush this hated rival, and secure the one desire of thy heart, the possession of Miriam!" The wily temptress detected a shade of irresolution in the young man's face, and hurried on. "Thou wouldst see some proof of my power before cred- iting it. Thy mother is in the blue tapestry chamber. Place thyself in the secret passage leading to it. I will go to her unannounced, and mark well what follows!" He followed this strange woman's direction. His brain was so bewildered that it seemed a'sort of relief to obey rather than to command. Could she fulfil her promises? WTho was she? How had she become acquainted with the secret passage, known only, as he' supposed, to his mother and himself; for the house had been in Rebekah's possession for nearly twenty years? These were the questions that presented themselves, and not the simple one, "How can I play the spy upon my mother at the bidding of a heathen stranger?" CHAPTER V. A MYSTERY. AFTER Ethni had so abruptly left his mother, she remained for a few moments in a sort of stupor. If his subsequent submission had hardly atoned for his momentary disrespect, what to the proud mother must have been this continued rebellion? For some time she waited, expecting his return; but he came not. Should she send for him? No, his re- turn must be voluntary to be of any value, and not enforced merely by her authority. At length she rose from her recumbent posture and paced the apartment to and fro, as if to soothe her feelings, ruffled by the unhappy scene through which she had just passed. Her thoughts dwelt upon the position she now occu- pied, and had done for nearly a score of years. During all that time she had enjoyed the friendship and respect of the high-priest, and all her actions had been so correct and praiseworthy, that she had won the title of " the saintly."   A MYSTERY.          35 She seemed above the foibles and vanities of the world, and led a sort of isolated life. Widowed when her only son was yet an infant, she had    withdrawn from the world, though dwelling in a populous I   city. In the ordinary pursuits or amusements of life she took no part. With wealth sufficient to raise her above the need of exertion, she devoted herself entirely to the educa- tion of her child and the duties of her religion. All the ceremonials of the latter she performed with the strictest nicety; for no priest was better versed in the Mosaic ritual than she, and the world offered no allurements to distract her from its fulfilment. All that was loving in her nature she concentrated on her son. To her dependents she was just, but stern and un- yielding whenever they severed from the narrow path she had marked out for them in which to walk. Such a charac- ter might win respect, and did even from the King who sat on the throne; but little if any love or sympathy, save from her son, who bestowed upon her an affection that fully sat- isfied the proud mother's heart. Whatever the current of Rebekah's thoughts, they brought placidity to feature if not inward peace to the soul; and when Ethni looked into the apartment from the secret passage in which he had concealed himself, he could detect no trace of angry emotion upon his mother's face. Suddenly and unannounced the Arab woman stood upon the threshold. Around her hung in heavy folds the blue v   drapery she had pressed aside on entering, and now she    stood erect and motionless. Rebekah uttered a cry of surprise at this sudden inbreak on her privacy. Then, recovering herself, she exclaimed: ;S.  "What means this bold intrusion? Who art thou? If thou needst alms, seek them at the gate!" "Rebekah, I need no alms at thy hands,5" was the un- moved reply. This confidence of manner excited Rebekah's curiosity, and she again enquired, but with less asperity of tone ; "Who art thou, then?" "An Arab soothsayer." "Woman -of an accursed race, begone!" angrily ex- claimed Rebekah, " there is contamination in the air thou breathest. Begone iqstgntly, or I will have thee spurned ,PPoie i148t440y, or I ,ill 14ave thee     36          ATIIALIAIT. from my door," and she reached forth her hand to strike a bell, her usual signal for summoning her attendants. "Have patience!" coolly responded the Arab woman, advancing into the apartment and arresting Rebekah's mo- tion by laying her hand upon her outstretched arm. Before Rebekah recovered from the surprise occasioned by this in- solence, the stranger whispered a few words into her ear. The effect was instantaneous and startling! Rebekah's arm fell nerveless by her side. Her gaze became fixed, as if discerning some fearful vision of the past. Her white lips quivered, and she sank half-fainting to the floor. Had the Arab woman been of stone, her cold indifference to this striking result of her whispered words could not have been more complete. She knew that Ethni was a close observer of the scene that was transpiring, and there- fore adopted a manner best calculated to impress him with a sense of her inmyerious power. She but illy s .,ceeded; whatever his after-thoughts might be, at the present moment his only consideration was for the deep agony of his mother. He stopped not to enquire what might be the import of the strange woman's words. The affection of the son had fully asserted itself, and it was only the peculiar position in which he had placed himself that prevented him from appearing as Rebekah's protector. But against what was he to protect her? The Arab woman had simply whispered a few words into his mother's ear, and her strength had bowed as a bulrush. This weakness, however, proved but temporary. The pride of years could not so easily be overturned. She rose to her feet, and by a mighty effort of her will regained something of her original mien: yet she could not conceal the supplicating tones of her voice as she asked, "What wouldst thou have, Rizpah?" 'l Nothing," was the cold reply, " except it be the privil- ege of kissing the saintly Rebekah's hand." Rebekah involuntarily shuddered, as she extended her left hand across her breast to this terrible woman. "I should prefer the other hand," said Rizpah in the same cold tone of voice. Rebekah complied with this strange request, and offered her the right hand. As the Arab woman raised it to her lips, her keen eyes were fixed upon a ring Rebekah wore, of   A AtYeSTERY.         37 very curious workmanship. Then, without uttering another word, she moved towards the door. Rebekah hastened after her. "What dost thou intend to do, Rizpah?" she anxiously enquilred. The woman turned her hard bronzed face and replied: "Why should I tell thee?" "What is thy object, Rizpah, in coming to me after so many years? Tell me the worst at once. Suspense will kill me." The quick ear of the Arab woman caught the sound of a deep sigh, unnoticed by her companion. Rapid in forming her combinations, Rizpah saw that the love for the mother in the heart of the son might transform him into a powerful foe, instead of the tool she designed making him. She there- fore changed her plan of action. "Thou askest me what I intend doing! What can I do? What would the word of a wandering Arab be weighed against thy stainless reputation. I would gain more by keeping the secret than by divulging it." This was very plausible, but conscience, that busy monitor of the heart, was speaking in Rebekah's bosom, and it made a coward of her. This sudden change in Rizpah's manner, too, for which she could not account, but which was none the less perceptible, aroused her suspicions. With reflection, however, her courage returned. Every object that appealed to the sight proclaimed her superiority over Rizpah. The rich and elegant ornaments of the apart- ment, her own costly attire, contrasting with the Arab wo- man's coarse habiliments, reminded her of the rank she held and the proud position she maintained in the world. With a feeling of relief Ethni again recognized his mother, as, drawing herself up to her full height, with all her accus- tomed haughtiness of manner, she dismissed the Arab woman with these words: "Thou hast come here for some purpose' I know not what. The surprise occasioned by sudden recognition of thee over- powered me, and thou hast been witness of my weakness. Thou goest without threatenings, but I shall not dismiss thee so. I tell thee, then, beware! Cunning as thou count- est thyself, I will over-match thee. And, mark me well!- utter but a syllable of that secret thou holdest, and I will     38          ATHALIAH. hurl thee to ruin without remedy, let the effects on my fate be what they may. Thou knowest well, murderess-aye, murderess-that I have the power, and to thy cost thou wilt find I will use it! Go, and see my face no more!" Rizpah, true to the new character she had assumed, bowed submissively to the haughty gesture of Rebekah, and left the apartment. At the same moment Ethni fled along the secret passage. He instinctively avoided witnessing his mother's solitude after the occurrence that had taken place. Had he waited, he would have seen the re-action, the crumn- bling away of proud defiance, the sinking down of the ex- hausted frame, the convulsive agony that sprang from the retrospect of long past years! When Ethni joined the Arab woman, it was with flashing eye and heaving breast. "'I will see thee again!" he ex- claimed, " but if thou raisest a finger against my mother's peace, though thou wert backed by Satan, I would crush thee as I would a viper. "Such is not at all my purpose, my lord Ethni," replied Rizpah in soothing tones: ' I would serve thee and thy mother too, would she let me. Trust me, and thou wilt yet see thy hated rival hi the affections of the beautiful Miriam in thy power. Let him then pity thee, if he can!" "What proof canst thou give me?" eagerly enquired Ethni, "that thou hast power to do this?" "Have I not shown thee already that I am no mere boaster? I have means at my command, of which thou wouldst- never dream. Only be steadfast in thy purposes, and thou shalt triumph-nay more, enjoy! Miriam shall be thine! See this!" and Rizpah showed him a ring, the exact counterpart of the one his mother wore, insomuch, that if he had not just seen it on her finger, he would have thought it the same. "I will come hither no more. When I wish to see thee, I will send this ring by my messenger. Fail not to obey the summons." Ethni, as if fascinated by the words and looks of this strange woman, bowed assent to her command. With a light, rapid step she left the room; while he abstractedly turned towards the window and looked into the street. Soon the clattering of horse-hoofs fell on the air, and a rider passed by. When opposite the casement at which Ethni stood, his horse, frightened by the fluttering of a   DAVID AND ABSALOM.        39 woman's robe, started suddenly on one side, stumbled, and but for the ready skill and strength of its rider, would have fallen. The woman, who was none other than Rizpah, glanced up at the window, and conveyed by look and ges- ture the intelligence that the horseman was Benaiah. "It was only a stumble-not a fall," was the muttered words of the son of Rebekah. CHAPTER VI. DAVID AND AND ABSALOM. AMONG all the peculiarities that distinguished the Jewish nation, none were more remarkable than the tri-yearly abandonment of home, by the men of the commonwealth, to attend the great festivals at Gibeon. At this period, though constantly engaged in warfare with enemies that almost surrounded their entire borders, they left the country un- guarded, and laying aside sword and shield, engaged in the services of their religion. Never saw earth a sublimer sight, than a nation of strong men leaving their homes, many of them  tenanted with fathers too old to take the journey, or with children too tender-leaving their wives and little ones to the invisible defence of their God! Every road leading to Gibeon was thronged, for the Feast of the Passover was drawing nigh. Each city and hamlet, every mountain side and valley, had sent their tributary streams, and soon around the walls of Gibeon lay encamped the twelve tribes of Israel. Each tribe had in its midst a tent surmounted with its ensign, over-topping its fellows. It was nominally the habitation of the Prince of the tribe, but was, in fact, only occupied by the Prince's chief officers. Apartments had been set apart in the house of the King for the twelve representatives of the nation. In all this throng-many of them warriors--no coat of mail glistened in the sunlight. They had met to worship God, and no symbol of war was visible. The army, as it were, had melted away, and the only distinct organizations     40          ATHALIAH. now apparent were the twelve tribes and the priests and Levites, busy in their service about the tabernacle. Even the pomp usually attendant upon royalty was laid aside, for David on occasions like this set the example of yielding all deference and honor to God's representative, the High-Priest. A nation had convened for one grand purpose-the celebra- tion of its deliverance from Egyptian servitude; and as its members were all on an equality in the days of their ad- versity, so now their descendants, when meeting together to recall the past, forgot all earthly distinctions-merging themselves in one great family-their father, God. In a room situated in the most elevated portion of the King's house, and which for the fine prospect it commanded and the retirement it afforded, was a favorite resort of David, Ahithophel sought an interview with the King. He had a special purpose in view, and after exchanging a few words on indifferent topics, he sought in his mind the best way of introducing the subject on which he wished to speak. Happening to glance through the window by which the King was sitting, he saw something that exactly suited his purpose. Along a broad avenue skirted on either side with tents, which encircled the city without the walls, rode Absa- lom, in all the pomp of kingly rank and more than kingly beauty. Splendidly attired and mounted on an Egyptian horse of great value, numerously attended by those whose presence added dignity to his ordinary escort, the Prince as he passed on gracefully bestowed smiles and salutations on the men of Israel, who witnessed his dazzling progress. "Look, my   lord the King!" exclaimed Ahithophel, pointing to the distant pageant, "this is the second time this day that Prince Absalom has made the circuit of the city walls, besides passing through the principal streets of the city." "And what is there in this worthy of blame?--perhaps a little vanity, excusable in one so young and handsome." "Something deeper and more terrible than vanity," re- torted Ahithophel in low but firm tones. "Ahithophel, what meanest thou?" exclaimed the King with some warmth, "in persisting so in thy accusations against my son Absalom?" then after a pause, in milder ac- cents, "True, he grievously sinned in the matter of Amnon, but there was some extenuation for Absalom, for his brother   DAVID AND ABSALOM.       41 had foully wronged him in the person of his beautiful sister Tamar, whom he dearly loved. Besides, he has long since repented of that dreadful deed." "Amnon was the first-born; this removal made the Prince Absalom heir to the crown, Chileab his elder brother hav- ing died in his youth," replied Ahithophel. "Ahithophel! I will hear no more of this," angrily ex- claimed the King. "Have I not made Solomon my heir?" "So God by the prophet Nathan directed thou shouldst do," firmly replied the King's counsellor. '; But beware, my liege lord, that Absalom does not thwart thee, even in thy obedience to God's command. Oh! my King! forgive the zeal of thy old servant," coninued Ahithophel, falling oil his knees, " let my hoary head padfor indulgence! Mis- trust Absalom. He is striving to gain the crown even while his father lives!" Surprise kept King David silent. Ahithophel hurried on. "For months past he has been laboring to steal the hearts of the nation from thee, and thou hast seen that this sacred Feast of the Passover he perverts by making it the instrument of his ambitious designs. Thou dost not believe that ambition to win thy throne is his purpose. I have proof positive that it is so. This morning, while yet I lay in my bed, the Prince sought me and unblushingly told me of his plans-offered that I should be King in power and influence, if I would join his cause, while he would only re- tain the name and pleasures of royalty. And when I threatened with scorn to denounce him to thee, he only laughed and said, 'we will see whom the King will the most readily believe when I deny thy story--thee, plotting to secure the kingdom for thy descendant Solomon, bribing Nathan, as I think, to declare him to the King as his God- appointed heir, and terribly apprehensive of anything that may retard thy purposes-or me, his favorite son! '" Soon after this conversation had commenced, Absalom who was riding outside of the city walls, had suddenly left his retinue, and urging his horse to the utmost, soon reached the King's house. Fearing Ahithophel might carry his threat into execution, he had him watched, and not long after the counsellor was closeted with the King, the Prince received intimation of it. As he entered abruptly into the presence of David, Ahithophel rose from his knees and re-     42          ATHALIAHe garded Absalom with a stern look. The Prince, flushed with the excitement of his rapid ride, and his eyes beaming with all the aroused intelligence of his soul for the coming conflict, had never looked so beautiful. He knelt gracefully at his father's feet, and taking the King's hand, pressed it affectionately to his lips. "Father," and there was a tenderness in the tone that thrilled that doting father's heart: "forgive me for thus entering thy royal presence without permission. Surely no form should keep separate a father and son, when that son is being denounced by one unfavorable to him." Tears moistened the King's hand. "How knowest thou that thou wert being denounced," sternly demanded Ahithophel, losing all control over his feelings by this hypocrisy of Absalom. "But a few mo- ments since thou wert riding outside the city walls." "I was," replied the King's son, still holding his father's hand, and speaking in calm and ingenuous tones: " but a faithful friend who loves me so well that he watches closely the actions of my greatest enemy, sent me a token just now that thou wert with the King, and that thy communication boded no good to me. And father, I hastened hither as fast as horse could carry me, to throw myself at -thy feet, and appeal to thee for the sincerity of my love for the best and most generous of fathers. What wilt thou have me do? God knows I would die to serve thee!" Absalom raised his eyes towards heaven, larger and more lustrous through the tears that filled them. Ahithophel had time to recover himself. He saw that it boded but ruin to him, to continue this contest. The King, carried away by the beauty and eloquence of his son, had clasped Absalom's head to his breast. Dangerous as it was to leave the field to the full possession of his wily antago- nist, no other alternative presented itself. He therefore quietly withdrew. This astute and subtle Prince, thus left alone with his father, even while on his knees, and with tears in his eyes, coolly ran over in his mind the plan of action this new circumstance demanded. He had been in doubt whether Ahithophel would have the boldness to de- nounce him to the King, but had taken the precaution of placing a watch on him. He had thus been enabled so op- portunely to interrupt the interview, that might otherwise-   DAVID AND ABSALOM.,        43 have proved dangerous to him. For two years he had been laboring for the accomplishment of his purposes. At the three great Festivals in each year, he had had opportunity of meeting all the men of Israel, gathered together in one place-an advantage of which he had fully availed him- self. Besides, all those who had come to Jerusalem for justice had experienced the gracious manner and kind promi- ses of the Prince-promises which he declared only his lack of power prevented him from fulfilling. Absalom's cause was at this time almost ripe. His last effort had been to win Ahithophel. He trusted that the wise man would comprehend that his success was certain, and would therefore be willing to relinquish the chance of the future succession of his descendant to the throne of Israel, and grasp instead the almost certainty of present power and influence. He had failed so far, but he hoped in the hour of his success, Ahithophel would join him. He there- fore determined to strike the final blow. He had previously selected the city of Hebron as the head-quarters of the re- bellion. Not doubting that Ahithophel had acquainted the King with the proposition he had made him that morning, he led David to speak of it. In tones of assumed humility Absalom commenced the conversation. "Father, have I been unjust in what I have said of the wise Ahithophel? If so, I will this day offer a sin-offering. It is, indeed, a grievous fault for so great a sinner as I have been rashly to judge others." "No, my son," replied the King, " in this thou hast spoken with truth. Ahithophel has accused thee of a hei- nous sin, but," added David, on witnessing the apparent ter-   ror oa Absalom's countenance, "I could not believe it." "And of what did Ahithophel accuse me?" mournfully enquired the Prince.          "Of aiming to snatch from me my crown." Absalom  sprang to his-feet in well-feigned indignation. He stood there for a moment with form upraised and flash- ing eye. Then, with downcast looks and bowed head he humbly murmured, " perhaps I have too much given way to my pride and vanity. Alas! I fondly, foolishly thought I was only reflecting the kingly grandeur of my dear father."     "         ATHALIAH. David, anxious and yet hoping that Absalom would ex- culpate himself, replied: "Ahithophel judged not alone by appearance, my son. He accused thee of offering him the power of royalty, while thou wouldst keep only its name and pleasures, as the re- ward of his adherence to thy cause." Again the full dark eye of Absalom flashed-but for a moment. Tears quenched the lightning and gave his eyes the depth and tenderness of loving woman's. He fell on his knees, and in tones tremulous in their ear- nestness exclaimed: "Father, be thou my judge, and judge me by thine heart, whose blood also circles in mine! Could I be guilty of so foul a crime? I, who have received such forgiveness at thy hands, after quenching the light of life of one near to thee as I am.! In youth's hot anger there might have been some palliation for that, for I dearly loved my fair sister Tamar, who had been so foully wronged. But what name black enough for the sin of rebelling against thee, after thou hast again taken me to thy heart? Believe me thus guilty, then life is useless to me," and Absalom half drew from his girdle a richly jewelled dagger, as if, in despair, he meditated end- ing his existence. David hastened to clasp in his arms his beloved son. His affection for him blinded his reason, for he never stopped to ask himself how it was possible for Ahithophel to make the assertion he had, if there had been no foundation for it. Absalom felt, though, that the time would come when the King would thus question himself. He could not strike the blow of open rebellion till after the Feast of Passover, then about to be celebrated. He must account in some way for this assertion that .Ahithophel had made. It quickly oc- curred to him that nothing would so easily impose upon the feelings of the King as the exhibition of a forgiving spirit. Instead, therefore, of accusing Ahithophel of fla- grant falsehood, he sought to excuse him. Absalom's tones were calm as, after the embrace which he lovingly returned, he addressed the King. "Father, do not think illy of Ahithophel in this matter. He is a man of unquestioned fidelity to thee and thy kingdom. I know he dearly loves his country. To him it is as mother, wife, and child. To his suspicious love I   DAVID AND ABSALOM.       45 might have seemed as if laboring to win the people's heart from thee, their rightful ruler. And as thou couldst not see with his eyes, he may have thought it wise to tell thee what was not, that thus thou mightsthelieve what he deemed was the truth." Then, with sudden animation, Absalom added, "Father, I will not rest till Ahithophel confesses to thee that this is the secret of the accusation he made against me." "No, no, my son," quickly replied the King, "let the matter rest here. I believe that thou hast hit the mark, for Ahithophel in his worldly wisdom has sometimes sacri- ficed truth to what he called the good of the State- a bad thing to do in any case, Absalom." After a moment's pause, in which Absalom appeared to be seriously meditating on his father's concluding words, he said: aS  "This day is my sin brought to remembrance. While in Geshur, suffering under the pain of thy just displeasure, I one day made a solemn vow, that if the Lord would bring me again to Jerusalem, and to my father's heart, I would make a journey to Hebron, the city of my birth, and there worship him. Father, this vow is as yet unfulfilled, sinful man that I am! Grant me, then, permission, after this sacred Feast of Passover is completed, to fulfil my vow." "Certainly, my dear son!" exclaimed the saintly King, delighted to find such a disposition in Absalom. "I have one more request to make. I am sensible of the weakness of my best endeavors. I would, therefore, that two righteous priests might go with me, that they may strengthen me in my purpose by their goodly counsel. I know two such, but cannot, at present recall their names." "And this request, too, is granted, my dear son," re- sponded the King. But, father, it may be that at the time of my departure they may be engaged in some service about the tabernacle." "I will give thee a written order commanding their at- tendance upon thee."  "Thou wilt have to leave the address blank, dear father, as at present I cannot think of the names of the two whose company I desire." The King went to a table on which were writing mate- rials, and penned the following words:     "         ATHALIAt. "It is my wish and command that you proceed with mv son, the Prince Absalom, to the city of Hebron, at such time as he may designate.    DAVID, THE KING." This order he handed to Absalom, who carefully secured it about his person. Then, falling on his knees, he exclaimed: "And now, dear father, give thy son a blessing of peace." The aged King placed, his hands on the glossy head of the Prince, and in tones tremulous with emotion gave him his fervent blessing. CHAPTER VII. THE PRINCE AND THE COUNSELLOR. ON leaving the King, Absalom, emboldened by his suc- cess, immediately sought the apartments occupied by Ahitho- phel. The ante-chamber he found vacant, but from the adjoining room came the sound of voices, and he heard his own name mentioned. Before he could catch the import of the conversation, Benjamin, the confidential servant of Ahithophel, entered the apartment. On seeing the Prince he showed signs of confusion. "Is my lord Ahithophel within?" blandly enquired Ab- salom. "He is," was the brief response. "Alone?  "Yes, my lord." "I will announce myself," quickly added Absalom, seeing that Benjamin was turning towards the door he had just passed through. X The King's son found the King's counsellor buried in deep reflection. He started with surprise when he saw his visitor. The Prince smiled, and holding out his hand said with charming frankness and grace: "My lord, I called thee my enemy a little while since, but that was in the presence of the King. It remains simply with thee to say whether we shall not be the best of friends and allies."   THE PRINCE AND THE COUNSELLOR.     47 "I hope always to preserve the friendship of the son of my master, the King," was the guarded reply. "A truce to fine phrases that mean'nothing, wise Ahitho- phel. Imitate my frankness. I have reason to be very an- gry with thee, for playing the tale-bearer to the King, but it has really done me no harm, and so I forgive thee. I dis- turbed thy meditations, I fear, on entering. Benjamin's re- port was favorable to my cause, and mayhap a few mo- ments' reflection would have induced thee to accept the offer I made this morning, and now renew with all my heart." Ahithophel was too much the master of his feelings to be thrown off his guard by the shrewd guess of Absalom as to the nature of the communications Benjamin had just made. The Prince was right in his conjecture. Benjamin had ascertained, by well-devised means, facts of Absalom's popularity with the people, and their wide-spread disaffec- Ahithophel while he was yet in anger at the blindness and mistaken indulgence of David towards his son. "Suppose Absalom should succeed," was the Counsellor's thought. "He may, and then I will lose all, unless I join him now. David is getting old, and is unfit to govern. Absalom is the natural heir to the crown. I may not live to see Solg- mon king. Certainly, Absalom will make a magnificent monarch, and if the people choose him for their ruler, what else is necessary?" Thus rapidly flitted through Ahithophel's mind these ideas. Absalom had arrived at an opportune time. "Well, Prince!" at length replied Ahithophel, catching as it were some of the gay, frank spirit of Absalom's man- ner, " since it is thy humor to suppose that I know inti- mately of thy matters, I must confess they are not progress- ing as favorably as I could wish, were I an ally of thine. As far as I can see, thou hast made an oversight that may in the end prove fatal to thy projects." "Thou referrest to the priesthood. I have not over- looked so important a point. Abiathar is already offended at the marked preference of King David for Zadok. He is something like thee, my lord Ahithophel, waiting for some sure sign of my success before he openly joins me." The Counsellor was not a little surprised at this fresh proof of Absalom's discernment. He had supposed Ibia-     E  - 4ATHALIAH. thar's loyalty unshaken, but now, reminded of the fact of David's open preference for Zadok, he saw how easily it could be used as a pretext for inducing the High-Priest to join Absalom against the King. The allusion to himself was a home thrust, none the less pointed that it was de- livered in such an easy, good-natured manner. "Do not be too confident of this success, Prince," replied Ahithophel, a little warmly, for he was displeased that Ab- salom should count on his adherence as so lightly gained. "David has not only been a great warrior, but a very popular King. The romance of his early life, in being anointed a King while a shepherd boy-his great feat in slaying Goli- ath of Gath, when a mere youth-his many wanderings con- sequent upon the unjust persecution of Saul-the beautiful friendship that existed between him and Prince Jonathan- his brilliant conquests over the Philistines seaward, and the Ammonites on the east, to say nothing of his rare ability as the author of the sweet Psalms sang in the tabernacle ser- vice-all these things have strangely won the -people's hearts." "My lord Ahithophel, thou hast overlooked one item in the list of this great King's qualities--his adultery with thy son's daughter, Bathsheba, for thou knowest this is the word for the secret deed that brought dishonor to thy house," was the ironical responme of Absalom. The Counsellor's choek flushed with anger. How Ab- salom had learned this fact he did not stop to ask. It was enough for the present that it was the truth. It galled the haughty Ahithophel no e the less, that the King had made the best atonement in his power, by afterwards marrying Bathsheba-none the I ss that he had made her son heir to the throne. In the first instance, reproach had been cast upon the fair fame of Eis house, and now it seems this was known to others. It was the object of the wily Prince to exasperate Ahitho- phel against the Kingl He was careful that no odium should rest upon him as the revealer that this secret was known to others, and he therefore added in soothing tones, "My lord, that was a deed unworthy of a great King. I do not lay claim myself to much righteousness, but thou wilt bear me witness that I have tampered little with the seventh commandment of our sacred decalogue. Ammon   THE PRINCE AND THE COUNSELLOR.     49 was rather more in that line than any of my father's sons." Then, after a pause, in which Absalom seemed studying the countenance of Ahithophel, "I was much surprised, my lord, this morning, on meet- ing one who I think knows the secret, and who entertains very proper ideas in connection with it. Shall I reveal the incident?" "As you please," moodily replied Ahithophel. "There is a member of the King's guard," resumed Absalom, " named Reuben, the son of Ahaziah. He has been in service about a score of years, and such has been his courage and fidelity, that offers of promotion have been re- peatedly mode to him, but in every case declined. Such a character naturally attracted my attention, and from little indications I deemed him worthy of a personal effort. I made it. He cut short my arguments by these remarkable words: 'Prince Absalom, I am not to be bought either by gifts or fair words. I believe thee to-be God's instrument to punish King David for' his abominable sin. When the time of action arrives, thou mayest count on me as on thy- self.' He was a warm friend of Uriah the Hittite, and bore his body from the field when he was slain. His words struck me as having a darker significance than that which would attach to mere wife-robbery." Ahithophel made no reply. It was questionable whether he had taken in the sense of Absalom's words. "My lord Ahithophel, let us at least understand each other," said Absalom in decided tones. "If not prepared to join, me, may I count on thy neutrality? I have been very frank with thee. Say, then, art thou still determined to thwart me by another appeal to the King?" "Little use in that," bitterly replied Ahithophel. "Mayhap  thou art making reservation in favor of "Joab?" "Then he is 'no ally of thine?" quickly enquired Ahitho- phel. "No, but I have one that will prove more than his equal," frankly responded Absalom. "How long is this neutrality to last?" "Only one month." "I will agree to it, then."     50          A ATHALIAH. "' Thy word is amply sufficient, my lord," replied Absalom, "4 and to show thee my perfect confidence in it, I will reveal to thee the head-quarters of the rebellion. It is the city of Hebron, only twelve miles distant from Giloh. After the Feast of the Passover thou mayest, if thou wilt, go to thy house in Giloh, without suspicion of any kind attaching to thee. Then thou mayst judge for thyself of the prudence of joining my cause. I have no doubt what thy decision will be. Remember I offer thee something more than the office thou art now filling. Once on the throne, be mine the proud title of King and the pleasures of royalty-thine the real power, but with it the cares. I will have none of them. "My presence is required in Giloh. On my return to Je- rusalem I purposed going there." With a respectful salutation Absalom withdrew, carefully concealing the elation he felt at this new triumph. And yet Ahithophel was not fully won. A man of his wisdom would not come to so important a decision without long and careful consideration. Offended pride at the King's late rebuff, and the awakened memory of the wrong that King had done the honor of his house, led him to make a promise of neutrality to the rebellious Prince; and more, to take the first step towards an open adherence to his cause. But still he left an open door of withdrawal. Abstractedly he walked to a window that overlooked the inner court. By the side of a fountain, whose waters fell with cooling, musical dash, Solomon, the boy-heir to the throne, was playing, and near him was his mother, Bath- sheba. The quick, roving eye of childhood soon discerned the grave Counsellor. With a gleeful smile he called his mother's attention to the window. She looked up, and by look and motion sent cordial greeting, little thinking it was a mute appeal for the future welfare of her son, who joined her in this tribute of affection. Ahithophel so re- garded it, for as he turned from the window, after acknowl- edging the salutation of the mother and her child, he mur- mured: "We will see, we will see."   THE PASSOVER.          51 CHAPTER VIIL THE PASSOVER. THOUGH the obligation was binding on every male adult Jew to attend all the three great festivals, yet the Passover was ever regarded as the pre-eminent-the Queen of the Feasts. Circumstances might occur to prevent attendance "  at the remaining two, but should this occur at the Passover, another and supplementary feast was ordered to take place just one month later than the first, that the non-attendants :?!  on that occasion might avail themselves of this new oppor- tunity of commemorating it. This shows the importance at- tached to its proper solemnization by the law-giver; but there were other considerations that endeared it to the Jewish heart. It was the anniversary of the nation's birth. Centuries might elapse, and yet the children of Israel would hear the tramp of that mighty multitude, mingling with the surge of the retiring waters, as they safely trod on the bottom of the inland sea. For, though the Passover strictly commem- orated the passing of the Angel of Death over the blood- stained houses of their ancestors, yet it was an easy transi- tion to apply it to the victorious passage of the Red Sea. Kings in their travels had levelled hills and filled ravines, to make themselves straight roads, but it was only for the King of Kings to roll back the ocean's waters, that his peo- pie might pass dry-shod. True, there were bitter herbs eaten in the celebration of this great festival, pointing to the misery of their bitter bondage; but how sweet such remembrances to a people- slaves once-but now, the superior of the nation that then oppressed them. Egypt was glad to furnish instruction to Israel's sons and daughters-ready to lay at the feet of its stalwart warriors an offering of whatever its arts could pro- duce.  The Jews at one time were their producers. The position had changed. They were now the servile workers --their former slaves the lordly purchasers of their wares. Under ordinary circumstances the persons celebrating this great feast with the King-for it required at least a com-     52          ATHALIA1H. pany of ten, and might be increased to twenty, but not be- yond-would have been David the King, Bathsheba the Queen, with her son Solomon, now ten years of age, and heir to the crown, Prince Absalom, with his little daughter Tamar, about the age of Solomon, Prince Adonijah and other mem- bers of the King's family, swelling the number a little be- yond the minimum. Outside of the royal family were Abia- thar, the High-Priest; Zadok, a priest second in dignity but first in favor with the King; Hushai, the King's friend, or favorite; Ahithophel, his counsellor, or prime minister; Joab, commander of all the King's forces; Mephibosheth, the lame son of the ill-fated Imathan, whom  David sought out when he had acquired power to serve him, and declared he should always eat at the King's table; and Eliam, the father of Bathsheba, and one of David's worthies. On the present occasion, through the subtlety of Absa- lom, two of the most prominent'personages just mentioned found themselves excluded from the King's table, Abiathar and Ahithophel, the former representing the spiritual, the latter the civil affairs of the kingdom. The wily Prince, following up his assumed character of a penitent, and yet a zealous advocate for the honor and glory of their God, humbly suggests to his father the impropriety 8 of calling the High-Priest, who, on an occasion like this, was really the nation's head, to be a guest, as it were, at the table of only its temporal King. Such an argument was very potent with a character like David's, naturally devo- tional and spiritual, and more than ever now as he neared the confines that separate the worlds, this one and the next. And who so suitable to gently convey this seeming repulse as the pious Absalom, who had suggested it? He did it very effectually, as the sequel will show. In the case of Ahithophel, Absalom affected a gush of forgiveness and amity that even startled the sweet Psalmist of Israel. "Oh! father!" were his words, "how glad am I that this glorious Feast of the Passover is at hand. I will meet Ahithophel there, and then, when the treasures of by-gone days are wafted- around us like rich perfume in the air, when they stand out glittering like precious stones in every symbol that surrounds us, when even bitter herbs touched   Ig-!            TIE PSASOVER.         53 bby the transforming hand of Adonai are made sweet, as were the waters of Marah, then he will frankly acknowledge that, though vain, frivolous, and passionate in sudden temp- tation, I am yet a faithful, loving son to the best and kind- est of fathers."' David saw in this the generous, impulsive outhursts of a young and untried heart. He thought within himself, "It will never answer to bring such richness of flower and fruit into contact with the flinty ice of years of suspicion and distrust, that formed no small part of the proverbial wisdom of his counsellor." He shuddered at the very idea, and gave orders to the officer of his household having the matter in charge, to exclude Ahithophel from the list of in- vited guests. Eliam absented himself of his own accord. He intimated to the King that matters of public interest kept him from the feast, and that he would be obliged to avail himself of the privileges of the second Passover. The real cause of this absence was, again, Absalom. The only difference was that the father of Bathsheba had already been won and was at 'work; the other two were still in the balance. Apart from the solemn interest that pervaded this feast, in this instance, how much that was merely local clung to it. Did the shade of the betrayed and murdered Uriah chill the memories of David and Bathsheba? Or did they lovingly glance at Solomon, their child, the God-appointed heir to Israel's throne, to warm themselves in his sunny smile-the pledge, mayhap, of heaven's forgiveness of their sin? And what of the timid yet frank glances of childish love that flitted like birds between Solomon and Tamar? Did the parents of the kingly heir note it, and muse on what might be? Or did the dark, scheming Absalom pause in his guilty path, as if descrying a lighter, better road, at whose end he beheld his loved daughter queen?  If he did, it was but the hesitation of the hour. He steadily worked out the bitter end he was pursuing. God in his providence made the beautiful little Tamar the mother of a race of kings. Though she wedded not Solomon, her daughter Maacah became the wife and queen of his son Rehoboam. There is another household gathered at no great distance from the King's house, that claims attention; that of Ahitho-   54          ATHALIAH. phel. Finding himself excluded from the royal table, and rightly judging through whose influence it had occurred, he sat down in the midst of his own family to solemnize the feast. His three grandchildren and the servants of the house-for at the Feast of the Passover all distinction of rank was laid aside-made up the required number ten. There was, therefore, no positive necessity why Benaiah should par- take of the feast with them; in fact, his proper place was at the table spread in his brother Reuben's house; but Miri- am, who was usually particular about even the smallest matters, and who was allowed to have entire control by Ahithophel, overlooked this trifling irregularity. The ceremonies attendant upon the sacred feast were carried out to the letter, though its spirit might have been neglected by certain of the participants. The lamb had been set apart on the tenth day of the month, and on the fourteenth day had been carried to the court of the taber- nacle, where, before the altar of sacrifice, it had been slain and its blood poured out by one of the attendant priests. Then it had been taken back and roasted whole, the spits supporting it crossing each other at right angles. Unleav- ened bread and a sauce made of bitter herbs were eaten with it.        . The youngest person present, in this case a little serving- maid, asked the meaning of the feast. Ahithophel then re- counted the history of its original formation in a listless manner that accorded very illy with the grand and inspir- ing events he narrated. His thoughts were busy elsewhere. It was not the birth of a nation he was thinking of, but the probable overthrow of that nation's King. He was balancing in his mind the chances of Absalom's success, calculating the strength of the current that seemed to be carrying the projects of the wily Prince to a favorable haven, and asking himself whether he should resist or glideo on with it. Adin and Helem, though making some efforts worthily to participate in the feast, often found their thoughts wander- ing away, like their father's, to Absalom. But how widely different the nature of their reflections from Ahithophel's. Where he saw the unnatural conspirator against his father and his King, they perceived only the most generous and magnanimous of princes. For, just before the Feast of the   THE PArSSOVER.         5 Passover, Absalom had met them, and notwithstanding the ungracious manner in which his costly gift to Helem had been returned, he overlooked the slight, and only alluded to it to excuse Ahithophel for what he called a little prejudice against him. Though neither of the brothers had the re- motest idea of openly braving their father's injunctions re- garding the Prince, they secretly hoped that time -would bring some change for what they deemed the better. No such influences distracted the mind and heart of Be- naiah and Miriam. They were together, and every thought and aspiration, therefore, centred in the present. It was the first Feast of the Passover they had celebrated together --nay, at the preceding one they had been strangers to each other, and this added a new zest to their enjoyment, for Hope whispered to their hearts that in all succeeding ones they would join together. Here, then, was harmony too complete to be disturbed by outer influence. Ahithophel's narrative of the triumphal deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, and the signal punishment of their oppressors, might only be a skeleton of the truth, but Benaiah, recalling the glowing ac- counts of Miriam at other times, found no difficulty in cloth- ing it with the form and lineaments of a living recital. And with no less enthusiasm, though softened and sub- dued, Miriam offered her silent gratitude to God for the choice blessings that clustered around her life-path. A lit- tle while ago she had thought her home could hardly have been rendered happier than it was; and now its brightness was dimmed by the coming glory of a home to be shaded with her warrior-lover, when he should have exchanged that title for the one of" husband." The sacred influences of the feast followed these two after its solemnization had ended. The Passover moon shone on them in unclouded beauty, as they sat together in the vestibule of the house, looking out beyond the walls of Gibeon, on the tented city that lay around it. How serene and peaceful the scene to the charming egotists of love, for it was in sweet concord with the feelings of their happy hearts. How differently Ahithophel, from an upper window, looked upon those white tents gleaming in the moonlight. Beneath them he detected the dark, sinister forms of conspiracy and rebellion, while he attempted to descry in the future issues      56          ATHALIAI. of the events that were hastening on. The question, which side he was to espouse, that of the King already on the throne, or of the Prince striving to win his way there, was still unanswered. Had he only taken counsel from duty, how simple the solution of the problem, how happy its working out, not only to himself, but others beneath that roof, whose interests or happiness were more or less bound up in te bundle of his life. CHAPTER IX. THE TEMPTATION. ON the evening of Ethni's return from Gibeon to Jeru- salem, just as he was leaving his mother's house for a walk through the city streets, he was timidly accosted by a wo- man, whose features were concealed by a veil, and who had evidently been waiting for an opportunity of speaking to him. There was a tremor in her tones as she pronounced his name. He had heard that voice before, but could not at the moment recall when or where. As soon as his attention had been arrested, a hand, white and delicate, held out the ring which was to serve as a signal between him and Riz- pah. "I have been commanded by the person sending this ring to conduct thee to her dwelling." The voice was soft and gentle, but tremulous. I will go with thee. Is the distance great?" "Near the old gate of the city." No further words were exchanged. The timidity of his companion, and her evident disinclination to be questioned, deterred Ethni from seeking any information in that quarter. Besides, his pride kept him silent, though it allowed him to obey the call of a woman, who, to all outward appearances, was far below him in the social scale--yes, even to obey gladly. He had left home that evening for no other pur- pose than to allay, if possible, the fever of his soul by rapid motion through the city streets. The late Feast of the Pass-   THE TEMPTATION.         57 over had done little to tranquillize his mind. He therefore readily embraced the opportunity of seeing the woman who had made such promises to him; promises that, if realized, would gratify alike his feeling of love for Miriam and hate for his favored rival. Absorbed as he was in his reflections, he did not fail to note, during their somewhat lengthened walk, that his com- panion seemed ill at ease, and was performing a service not altogether suited to her. There was a certain grace in her motions and an air of refinement in her manner, that not only enforced Ethni's respect, but made him feel that there was an impropriety in her acting as Rizpah's messenger. He was several times on the point of asking her if she could not direct him to the -house, and thus spare herself the trouble of going further. But the intent was not strong enough to induce him to break the silence they had hitherto preserved. Even upon reaching the place of destination, Ethni's com- panion said nothing, but simply pointing to the door he was to enter, left him, and soon her light foot-falls ceased to sound. as she hurriedly retraced her steps along the street they had just traversed together. It then occurred to him that she had retained the ring. He had expected, too, that as she had come all the way with him, she would introduce him to Rizpahll's presence. He had no time for conjecture, for the door of the house before which he stood opened, and the Arab woman stood before him. "I have been waiting for thee, my lord Ethni," were her words, uttered with respectful deference, " and would not have asked thee to my poor dwelling, had I known a better place for our meeting." Ethni glanced around him. -The house was small, and the room, opening on the vestibule in which they now were, was plainly and scantily furnished. He followed Rizpah into a second one, which contained many of the appliances of her craft. She turned to Ethni, and with a smile, if anything so sinister can be called by that name, said: "Here is where I receive those who would know the se- crets of futurity. If they are satisfied, I am sure I ought to be, for it brings me no little gain.", "It might bring thee destruction, if known in certain quarters," replied Ethni. 5*  58          ATHALIAH. "Enough that I have safely practiced the art for a score of years, though not always in the same places," lightly re- sumed Rizpah. Leaving this room, they entered a little court, enclosed on all sides, and with no visible means of egress save the door by which they had entered it. Ethni glanced up and saw the walls surrounding them were blank. Not a window or opening of any kind broke the even surface. Rizpah, without any ostentation, placed her hand on a certain portion of the wall, and pressing at the same time the pavement under her feet, a motion unobserved by Ethni, a door, so ingeniously constructed as to appear part of the wall, opened and revealed a narrow passage, at whose fur- ther end was another door. Ethni at once entered the passage. His pride forbade him to hesitate, for hesitation would have shown fear, and that he scorned. Rizpah, closing the outer door, which in- volved them in deep darkness, passed to the inner one. This she opened with a key, for Ethni could hear the dull click of the wood, though he could see nothing. When the door turned on its hinges, he could scarcely re- frain from an exclamation of surprise. Accustomed as he was to all that was rich and elegant in the adornments of the dwellings of the wealthy in Jerusalem, here was a mar- vel of beauty and taste that he had never seen equalled. Its effect might have been heightened by the striking con- trast it bore to the plainly-dressed, swarthy-faced woman, who was its mistress, and who was standing in its midst; but as she turned towards Ethni, and unconcernedly asked him to be seated, he, instead of complying, looked around him as might a child, when dazzled by some unexpected scene of grandeur or of beauty. The room was circular, and the rich silken drapery of crimson, curiously embroidered with gold and silver threads, entirely concealed the walls, and was so arranged as to give the apartment the appearance of a tent. The floor was composed of woods of various colors and kinds, so disposed as to form figures of strange device. Light was furnished by four lamps, of a form and workmanship entirely new to Ethni. They were of silver, and rested on pillars of porphyry. Cushions and couches were luxuriously dis- posed about the apartment, and a delicate perfume per-   THE TEMPTATION.        59 vaded the air, that seemed to lull the senses to calmness and repose. The articles of ornament, or of unknown use, scattered around, were numerous, but all strange to the eyes of Ethni. Many climes must have united to produce them, for they were widely diverse in material and workmanship. On a small table near one of the porphyry pillars, the light falling full upon it, was a jewel casket, the lid of which was raised, and from its downy nest flashed a radi- ance that fixed, as soon as it caught Ethni's gaze. He ap- proached the table and took from its case a richly gemmed bracelet, on whose inner surface he sought for, and found traced his father's name. But for the jealous care with which his mother guarded its exact counterpart, he might have supposed, as in the case of the ring, that it was the same. Still holding the bracelet in his hand, he turned towards Rizpah, as if seeking an explanation of her singu- lar possession of the jewel. This she did not vouchsafe. Though she had intention- ally placed it there for Ethni to observe it, still it was no part of her plan to explain to him how she had come to share with his mother what at one time must have consti- tuted the entire gift of the husband to the wife. Her action in taking the bracelet from him, though gentle, was yet firm, and Ethni felt he had no right to resist it. Rizpah returned the bracelet to its casket and closed the lid. Ethni then recalled the scene he had witnessed in the blue tapestry chamber in his mother's house, and shrank from seeking any further light. It was simply another mystery added to those that had gone before. Where would they end? Would he ever learn at what points his mother's life, so fair and upright, could ever have touched on this woman's, so strange and unknown to him? Rizpah, in no way embarrassed by the incident that had just occurred, again motioned Ethni to a seat. This time he complied, while his mysterious companion seated herself at a respectful distance from him. "Here is perfect privacy, my lord Ethni. We can neither be seen nor heard by any one, and it was for the rea- son that this place affords such advantages for an interview, that I have presumed to send for thee, by a trusty messen- ger, to come hither,"     60          ATHALIAH. "I have complied, as thou seest, with the hope that what thou hast so confidently promised, thou wilt be able to fuli fil." "Thy confidence in me shall not be abused. Let me therefore frankly state, that my ability to aid thee consists rather in pointing out the path that leads to success, than in furnishing the means to pursue it. If thou art fully in earnest, and will use all the sources of power thou now hast, and those that will be placed in thy hands, thy designs will be accomplished." "My presence here shows that I am in earnest, for why else should I be so ready to accept the aid of one who is an entire stranger to me?" "Yes, that is true, but thou art no stranger to me ; neither is Benaiah, thy favored rival, nor Miriam. It is my intimate knowledge of these three lives that enables me to assist thee." 4( What is thy motive in aiding me?" enquired Etlhni, the idea seemingly occurring to him for the first time. "What compensation can I furnish for thy assistance? Thou canst scarcely need money, with such a room as this to inhabit." "I need no money or aught else at thy hands," quickly answered Rizpah. "What need to ask about the source of/ the stream, so long as its waters are palatable and clear  Thou wilt soon have proof of the wisdom of the counsel Ir give thee, if thou wilt follow it." "Speak unreservedly. I have not gone so far as this, lightly to waver in my course now. That I should have failed in winning Miriam's love is something I might and ought patiently to bear, but that another has succeeded so readily, and snatched as it were the rich prize from me, this is what galls me. If I cannot enjoy, he shall suffer like me, and mayhap worse!" A smile of satisfaction at these words gleamed on Riz- pah's dark face. "Thou art right, my lord Ethni, in saying that this Be- naiah succeeded so readily, but thou mightest have added, so speedily, in securing the affection of this lovely maiden. The story of their acquaintanceship is very brief. They met for the first time, and not many moons ago, in Ahithophel's house, in the city of Giloh. Eliam, Miriam's uncle, was at that time making it his military head-quarters. Benaiah was then, as now, an ensign-bearer. The banner he carries into   XHi!           THE TEMPTATION'        61 battle was worked by Miriam's skilful fingers, and the oc- casion of their first meeting was that he might receive it at her hands. Then closely followed the battle, in which, by a single act of bravery, Benaiah won such fame and made captive the heart of Miriam, or perhaps only her fancy, fbr I doubt if love is of such a rapid growth." "No, she loves him," gloomily interrupted Ethni, "I know her nature well." "Be it so; but a maiden's heart, my lord Ethni, is not the most constant thing in the -world. -Thou sayest that thou knowest Miriam's nature. I need not tell thee, then, of her enthusiasm for all that relates to the glory of her country; that gentle as she is in her demeanor, and earnest in the duties of her religion, she still looks with more favor on the warrior than the priest. In a word, hadst thou been a soldier, thou wouldst not have sought in vain for Miriam's love, but would have won the prize before thy favored rival had appeared upon the scene. And even now I propose that thou shouldst embrace the profession of arms forth- with. This, believe me, is thy true, thy only vantage- ground." Ethni's countenance changed. He felt the strength of Rizpah's argument, but he saw what appeared to him an impassable barrier in the way it was proposed he should take. He objected, but without alluding to the true ob- stacle. It is too late to adopt such a course now. Besides, the results would be much less than thou thinkest. Peaceful times are coming, and the profession of the soldier promises to be one of inactivity. What prospect of advancement, then, would there be for me?" "My lord Ethni, I speak advisedly when I say to thee that peaceful times are not coming. The heavy tramp of approaching war already shakes the earth; its sounds are in the air! This conflict, which is now imminent, will be most favorable to rapid promotion. But apart from this, I can se- cure thee the favor of no less a man than the great Joab himself." "What meanst thou, woman? Which of Israel's former foes has strength to assail or resist her? If these words of thine are not idle, explain them!" "The foe is not from without, but from within. ' Rebellion     is about breaking forth! I have seen it in its secret lurking. places. The Prince Absalom will soon be in the field at the head of ten of the tribes of Israel, to wage war against his father for the throne." "How knowest thou this?" "I will tell thee, my lord Ethni, and the confidence I repose in thee, have in me. Ahithophel, the king's coun- sellor, so wise in all things else, has had the weakness to con- sult me on the probable issue of the coming conflict. He hesitated which side to choose, and sought me in this house, to peer, if possible, into the future. He was disguised, but I was not slow to question him, as if seeking grounds for divination, and soon penetrated his disguise. On the house-top I read the stars, and, in the room we lately passed through, consulted the smoking entrails of animals slaugh- tered by him. What the auguries proclaimed thou carest not to hear. I learned from him details, where before I had only heard of rumors and surmises. Therefore I confidently tell thee that war is at hand. Join the army of the King, for Joab will, I know, remain loyal to David, and it is from him, as the general of the royal forces, that thy good fortune must spring." Still Ethni hesitates, and well he may. And Rizpah knows the secret of his hesitation better than he can ex- plain it to her. She has tried artful argument to overcome it, and is watching the struggle she can see with her mind's eye is going on in Ethni's breast. "It will change all my plans in life," feebly objects the tempted. "If thy plans are dearer to thee than the love of the beautiful Miriam, do not change them," was the half-jeering words of the temptress. Then she hastily added: "My lord Ethni, I believe thee to be a man of strong will, else I had not sought thee, for I know thou hast great obstacles to overcome, ere thou attainest thy ardent desires. Thou hast asked me my motives in urging thee on. Suffice it to say, that, widely as we are separated in all things else, in this our interest is united. Thy advancement in love and ambition, and Benaiah's disgrace and overthrow, is what I crave, and the method of attainment I have pointed out is the best, the only one I know. I repeat it, and it is no idle boast, I can- secure thee the active favor of the mighty Joab. He dis-   I/             OT-FIRST STEPS.        63 likes Benaiah. He will promote thee over him. Opportu- nities will not be lacking to secure the disgrace of this in- solent rival of thine, who, basking in the light and warmth of Miriam's smiles, has only feelings of pity, if not of scorn, for the poor suitor who sought so long for what he so speedily obtained." "Say no more," fiercely exclaimed Ethni, springing to his feet. "Friend or fiend, I care not. Here is my hand. Help me on to love and revenge, and ask what thou wilt afterwards, thou shalt have it, if it is mine to give. Tell me the first steps to take, for I am in torment till I begin the work!" "Thou wilt have to purchase arms and armor, and prac- tice thyself in their use. Thou hast means at thy dis- posal!" "Abundant. But art sure of Joab's favor towards me? Recollect, on this hinges everything, for without it years must elapse before I could win my way up, for I have all to learn." Rizpah, without answering, went to a curiously contrived cabinet, and from one of its recesses drew forth a 'roll of parchment. Placing it in Ethni's hands, she said: "Be this my answer!" He hastily glanced at it, and found that it was signed by Joab, and conferred on Ethni, the son of Rebekah, the title of one of his order-bearers. CHAPTER X. FIRST STEPS. WHEiN Ethni awoke the next morning, he found some difficulty in separating the occurrences of the previous even- ing from the troublous dream that had succeeded them. Up to the time of leaving his mother's house, there was no event but what he could clearly recall, but after that reality had mingled and partly lost itself in thq unreal. The mes- senger who had timidly accosted him had appeared in his dream. So had Rizpah, and so had the beautiful tent-like  room in which they had held their interview. But the maiden of the dream, instead of being silent, had earnestly warned him against some unseen, but approaching danger, and anxiously endeavored to lead him away from Rizpah's house. He was on the point of following her, when Rizpah slowly became transformed into. a beautiful woman, that at first seemed Miriam, but when he looked more closely, her features changed again, and though still handsome, they were not those of the maiden he so wildly loved. Then the en- treaties of her who appeared his better angel were redoubled. And while he stood hesitating between the two, the tent- like room expanded and grew in height, until it seemed to be, the sky. It was the sky he saw now, with the rosy flush of coming day on its eastern border, and he rose from his couch and commenced the task of separating the things seen in sleep from the real thoughts and actions of the pre- ceding and eventful evening. The scroll of parchment he had received from Rizpah, and which had with such startling suddenness given him the po- sition of order-bearer to Joab, he held in his hands. This was tangible, and from this as a centre he worked out the complete circle of all that had transpired the past evening. But soon one consideration arose before him, and, like Aaron's rod, swallowed all others. His mother must be told, and at once, of the resolution he had formed of entering the military service. As to the circumstances that led him to this decision, he had no idea of enlightening her. To make the simple announcement, and obstinately cling to his avowed purpose, without being able to give any reason for it, for he scorned to fabricate one, was all he had to do. But how great was that all! It was the overturning and uprooting of his mother's tenderly nurtured plans, that she had fondly watched and labored for during long years! The blow that dealt such devastation was to be sudden, ruthless, brutal, and struck by the son against the moth- er's very life! All this Ethni had foreseen. Hence, the difficulty Rizpah had experienced in urging him on to form the purpose he had-a difficulty that, but for the dark sor- pery of the passions she had evoked, would have been insur- mountable. Rebekah had early designed her son for civil pursuits, as being the surest road to distinction in the commonwealth.   F'mSIRST STEPS.                      65 It required but little study of the times to denote this. King David, though a great warrior both in action and command, was so rather from the force of compelling circumstances than from ambition. Doubtless his shepherd life was dearer to him than the more stirring days when the maidens and matrons of Judea met him on his triumphant return from battle, singing, "David has slain his ten thousands!" Even when decked in the robes of royalty, his heart still clung in fond remembrance to the pastoral scenes of his early years, and he delighted in introducing their gentle and soothing imagery into the Psalms he composed for the tabernacle service. He had no love for the sons of Zeruiah, though they were ever faithful to his fortunes, and were brave and skilful generals. Their deeds of violence, though somewhat palli- ated by the rude customs of the times, were abhorrent to David. His favorite, Hushai, was a man of peace. Easy, therefore, to see that the most direct path to the favor of royalty was that which led through scenes most congenial to the monarch's taste; particularly when there was every indication of a long interval of peace, thus leaving the pro- fession of arms a mere name. Rebekah's ambition for her son, thus coinciding with the exactions of her mother-heart for his companionship and safety from the perils of war, made her purpose doubly strong, and its consummation became the all-absorbing en- deavor of her life. For this she became so close a student, that from the wealth of her knowledge she might have wherewith to lavish on him; for this she shaped every ac- tion of her life, toiled with her brain, and existed only in the future of her son. Much of her reward she received, when she discovered that Ethni's natural inclination lay in the course of life she had marked out for him, and that her rapidly developed tal- ents had fitted him for its pursuits. Nothing yet had run counter to the peaceful current of their lives. Her son's mysterious repulse, when with a mother's yearning tender- ness she pressed him to her bosom, had ruffled the waters a little. But she dreamed not that it was the precursor of the terrible tempest that was to follow. Thus Ethni, in the early morning hours, endeavors to strengthen himself for the coming interview with his mother,   "         ATHALIAH by picturing to his mind all that she would say, or do, or suffer. He had no thoughts of turning back. The com- mission he held in his hand from Joab effectually prevented that. He wondered how Rizpah had obtained it. He re- called what she had said about her interview with Ahitho- phel, and remembered the longing he had felt to ask her what her auguries declared, and that only his pride had kept him silent. Absorbing as was the consideration of the coming events of the day, he could not entirely restrain his thoughts from wandering back to the strange scene that had occurred to him not many hours previous. Rizpah, he argued, might be an adventuress, and doubtless was, but she was one of no ordinary stamp. Her knowledge of the past, and per- haps, too, of the future-for a wiser man than he had given credit for such wonderful power-the room in which he had talked with Rizpah, and which, for all he knew to the con- trary, might only be the ante-chamber to others greater in beauty or magnificence, her mysterious influence with Joab, that could induce him to give to one unknown to him, and without military skill or knowledge, a position so eagerly sought by many every way qualified for it, her interest in his fortunes, or rather the ground on which their interests could possibly unite, so as to make' the furtherance of his schemes of advantage to her-for Ethni rightly judged Rizpah as acting from no mere motives of generosity in this matter-all these considerations could not fail to lure him, in some degree, from the thoughts of the coming shock, that might destroy the peaceful, loving relations that had hitherto existed between his mother and himself. Yes, it might even come to this! The recollection of her proud obduracy when he had actually knelt to her for forgiveness, was still vivid to his mind. What, then, would be her emotions when she learned, as learn she must, that all her life-plans were to be scattered to the winds; and that her son, without so much as consulting her, had formed new ones, entirely different, which were henceforth to mark all his future action? Immediately after the morning meal, Ethni sought an in- terview with his mother, in a room where he knew they would not be interrupted. Feeling that any attempt to pre- pare his mother for what he had to announce would be use-   FIRST STEPS.         67 less, as he judged she would hardly credit the open avowal, he plainly told her of his fixed resolve. He had judged rightly. She did not credit it. "Ethni, my son, this is but a cruel jest to practice upon thy mother." "Mother, it is no jest. lNever was I more in earnest. Argument is useless. I have gone too far to recede." "Too far to recede! And I to hear nothing of it! No, no, Ethni, I cannot believe that thou wouldst treat thy mother so lightly. Thou art impatient at not having before this received some proof of kingly favor. Know, then, that I have a pleasant surprise for thee, that I have only been keeping till everything was certain---" Rebekah paused, for on Ethni's face rested a stern, fixed expression, that gave not the slightest sign of yielding. "Why, Ethni, have thy senses left thee? Hast considered that thou art totally inexperienced in the arts of the sol- dier? How canst thou ever hope to attain distinction in this way. I had hoped, oh! so fondly hoped, that my only son would have returned all my care and affection by pursu. ing a course that would have achieved a well-merited fame." "And so I shall," firmly replied Ethni. "I tell thee, my son, this is madness on thy part, and must go no further. Do not be guilty of so utterly disregarding all my plans for thy advancement. It would be wisdom for the soldier to give up his sword or his bow, and seek other employment. But to rush into the profession now when war is- over, is the rankest folly. Let me hear no more about it, Ethni, if thou lovest me." .  c There thou art mistaken, mother; war is not over! Rebekah regarded her son with a look of wonder. "War is not over? How knowest thou this? Some one has been imposing on thy credulity." Ethni might have refrained from informing his mother of what he had heard from Rizpah, but this taunt fired him. "No, mother! Thoulookest at our borders and sayest that war is over, but look within! It is a civil war that is coming. Absalom is arming against his father, the King!" "That is only surmise, Ethni. It furnishes no ground for thy opposition to my wishes." But I am a man now, mother, and must act for myself.     69   And to show thee that I have not acted unwisely, look at this!" He took from the folds of his garment the parchment he had received the previous evening from Rizpah, and handed it to his mother. A moment after he felt how imprudently he had acted, but it was too late now to retrace his steps. Rebekah read the words that had conferred on her son a position of no little eminence. Under some circumstances it would have gratified her pride and her affection, but now it only seemed the death-warrant of that love and confidence which had existed hitherto between her and her son. There was a mystery gathering around her she feared she might never be able to penetrate. Ethni seemed slipping away friom her, and she powerless to hold him back. "Ethni, these things are not had for the mere asking! How didst thou obtain this?" "It was obtained for me," Ethni replied, nervi ,lhimself for the encounter that was now inevitable. "By whom?" "That I cannot tell." "Not tell thy mother, Ethni?" The tones in which these words were uttered were rapid and vehement. Easier, therefore, for the son to answer. "Not even my mother." "Is this caprice, or hast thou purchased this empty honor at the price of thy good name? The bargain must needs be infamous, when thou canst not tell thy mother its conditions." "There was no bargaining for it," calmly replied Ethni to his mother's bitter words, for he felt himself in the wrong, and that he had no right to show any impatience; " it was freely given." "Leave me! I must be dreaming! Such things cannot be!" And Rebekah was left alone-alone with her thoughts, and with her God! Did solitude, that so often brings conso- lation to the disappointed or grief-stricken, bear healing on its wings for her troubled spirit? Or did she see the dark form of retribution looming up through the heavy mists that lay beyond her? Or, turning to the past, what does her awakened conscience point out to her, as linking itself to the trials and troubles that are coming upon her? No sign of inward peace upon those pallid features; no light of joy-   ous hope in those dry eyes! For her mind is filled with an event, which is living itself over again, and to which con- science is steadily pointing with inexorable finger! It is to shut out the vision that she buries her face in the drapery of her couch! Listen, she murmurs a name! ("Athaliah! 5    CHAPTER XI.   tI i II    GOING TO HEBRON.   IF anything had been needed to confirm Ethni in the course he had adopted, he would have found it in the cir- cumstance that occurred soon after he left his mother. Feel- ing the necessity of immediate action, he was about leaving the house to make the requisite arrangements for entering the army, when he heard the sounds of animated conversa- tion from the street. He recognized the voice of Helem, and obeying a first impulse, he drew back into the further corner of the vestibule. He saw Helem and his brother Adin pass. There was one with them that he doubted not was Benaiah. The words he caught were these: "But will your father, Ahithophel, allow you to accom- pany Prince Absalom to Hebron?" It was Benaiah who spoke. Helem answered in laughing tones. "Without doubt, for it is the King who gives the order." After the three had passed, Ethni advanced and looked after them. He noted the deference paid to the three young officers as they passed with gallant tread along the street, and his keen, roving eye did not fail to discover the admiring glances cast on them by fair faces only half con- cealed by clustering vine or silken drapery. "I have been blind," was his thought, " in striving to gain woman's love without the aid of outward glare and glitter. Rizpah is right." Taking a contrary direction from that which the three friends had pursued, he had not proceeded far when he wit-     nessed an incident of no common occurrence. Prince Ab- salom, mounted on a horse elegantly caparisoned, was bend- ing over its proudly arched neck and displaying a piece of parchment to a man, evidently of high station. Gracious smiles on the part of" the one, grateful deference from the other, and then hurried words of direction from the Prince. Then the trampling of horses' hoofs, flashings of bright equi- page in the gay sunlight, and the street was quiet again. But not Ethni's thoughts. He recalled Rizpah's words, and a rush of conflicting emotions surged through his soul. In the hantdsome, affable Prince, he descried the demon of civil conflict, and hugged the conviction to his breast that Benaiah would be lured into his toils. He loved his country, and for a moment shuddered at the thought of the dark evil brooding over it. He thought of Miriam, and felt a wild exultation in the tumult he saw approaching. It will be recollected that Absalom had obtained from his father the following order, on the pretence that he wished two priests to accompany him to Hebron, where he was go- ing with the King's permission, to fulfil a vow made during his exile. "It is my wish and command that you proceed with my son, the Prince Absalom, to the city of Hebron, at such time as he may designate.       DAVID THE KJING." The order wis without address. This was what the Prince had shown Adin and Helem, just before Benaiah had joined them, and not to them only, but to over two hundred; not all of themmerely youngmen of valor, but many of them men of age and honorable repu- tation. These were the " priests " the crafty Prince was taking with him to confirm him in his godly purpose. Adin and Helem, more particularly the latter, were earnest in their regrets that Benaiah had not been with them when the Prince accosted them, as, doubtless, then he would have been included with them in the order, or, as they re- garded it, the gracious invitation. Benaiah did not share in their regrets, although he was not hasty in informirig them of the fact. He had no cause to find fault with a longer tarrying in Jerusalem. His regret would be in leaving it. Adin and Helem had been directed by Absalom to meet him in a couple of hours at a point about midway between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. They were, therefore, hurrying   home to make hasty preparations for their journey. As far as reaching Ahithophel's houlse was concerned, Benaiah shared their alacrity. Beyond that he allowed them a perfect monopoly. But what was Benaiah's surprise to learn, on reaching Ahithophel's house-a surprise in which the brothers joined -that the principal part of the household had received in- structions to make ready to go to Giloh. Now it was that Benaiah joined most heartily in his , artil in his friends regrets that he was not to go with Prince Absalom to Hebron; for this city was but a few miles distant from Giloh. He readily acceded to a suggestion of Adin, that he should go with them to the place appointed by the Prince, as if for the purpose of leave-taking, trusting to for- tune that Absalom might extend his favor to him. Soon after, Ahithophel entered the house. Adin made him acquainted with the King's order. He manifested no displeasure, but considerable surprise. He asked Adin to repeat the words of the order as near as he could recollect With  Helem's help he gave a literal rendering of it.  To the question whether it had borne a particular address, he received a negative reply. Ahithophel could readily see the important use Absalom could make of such a document. But how had he man- agfed to obtain this order from the King, by which he might easily have tithed the population of Jerusalem? After this evidence of the cunning of the son, and the weakness of the father, the wise counsellor felt still further justified in the preparatory step he was taking. He simply remarked to his grandsons, that the King's order must of course be obeyed, and that if they could gain the Prince's permission, he would  wish them to ride over to Giloh a day or two after their arrival at Hebron. This they gladly consented to do, overjoyed at their father's compliance. Benaiah hoped very sincerely he might be there to ride over with them. His hope was realized. On  reaching the place appointed, they found a numerous party-so numerous that Benaiah might have joined it without the Prince's consent and run little risk of detection. But this was unnecessary. Absa- lom, in his hurried review, recognized the brothers, and grh- ciously extended an invitation to their friend to accompany bi m.*  '    " ATHEALIAH. Soon after, the cavalcade was in motion towards Hebron. It was led by Absalom ii all the pride of his peerless grace and beauty. In addition to the two hundred who had went  with him in their simplicity--men whom he had not thought  it prudent to attempt to lure from their allegiance to the  King while in Jerusalem-there was his own armed body-  guard, numbering some sixty or seventy men, besides a number of adherents who knew the real object of this ex- pedition. Excepting in the body-guard of the Prince, which for a palpable reason was placed in the rear of the cavalcade, there was no precise order observed in the progress towards Hebron. Friends rode together as it chanced, in ranks of four or five, and even more when the road permitted it; but the ranks were oftener composed of twos and threes, and Benaiah, who rode in a line with the brothers of Miriam, on glancing back at a turn in the road, observed a solitary  horseman, who either had no acquaintance in the party, or who preferred to indulge in his own reflections undisturbed, i rather than share them with others.          ! "Adin, thou hast not told me the object of this gay ex- pedition," said Benaiah.  Gay it was, for animated conversation, interspersed with laughter, resounded on all sides. "Naturally not, since I do not know it myself," was the J reply. "Perhaps, then, I ought to have asked Helem." "With like result," gaily replied the person addressed.  ( I am too happy in riding in the retinue of the gallant  Prince, to ask what further is required of me. I had hopes it was a military affair, but there is too much of a sprink- ling of civilians around us to admit of that." At this moment a message was brought from the Prince, who desired to see the brothers and their friend Benaiah. Being well-mounted, and the road at this point being of good width, they were soon by Absalom's side. He gra- ciously inclined his head as they rode up, thanked them for their company, and enquired of Adin whether Ahithophel had left Jerusalem. He smiled with peculiar significance when he heard that the counsellor had been on the point of going to the city of Giloh, when the Prince's party had left Jerusalem. Then, turning to Helem and Benaiah, he asked   GOING TO HEBRON.        73  them whether they had ever spent much time in Hebron- alluded to it in endearing terms as the city of his birth, and claimed for it a rank second only to Jerusalem in point of population and splendor. Won by the easy and affable grace of his manner, the young men made unembarrassed replies, and when others rode up in response to summons like their own, they fell back, convinced in their hearts that Absalom was the worthy son of a great King. The road had narrowed to a rocky defile, and the three friends, instead of attempting to stem the onward current, drew to one side to let it pass, as they preferred riding in the rear. Adin and Helem were acquainted with very many of the men who followed the Prince, and exchanged pleasant greetings with them as they rode on. Benaiahs eye again noted the solitary horseman. As he drew near he recognized his brother Reuben. Waving a hasty fare- well to his companions, he touched his horse and in an in- stant was by his brother's side. "Benaiah! thou here!" was the hasty exclamation that greeted him, but not in the joyous tones he had heard a little while since, when, in the early morning hours, he had chanced to meet Reuben in Jerusalem. "Even as thou art Reuben," was the gay reply of the light-hearted Benaiah. His brother's eyes rested searchingly upon him for a mo- ment, and then he gravely said: "Benaiah, thou knowest not what thou sayest. Adonai grant that thou art not as I, but art going after the Prince in thy simplicity, even as these others!" The gay expression fled from Benaiah's face, as he tried to fathom the hidden depths of these words: Not as thou art! In my simplicity!  What meanest thou, brother? I am here in obedience to an order from the King, whose servant I am." Yes, Benaiah, that I  know, though a moment since I feared it might be otherwise. Knowest thou how the order was obtained by the wily Prince?" "No, how should I?" "I will tell thee , Benaiah-by fraud and false pretence. Absalom, knowing   that I followed him with my eyes open, and fearing that I  might unwittingly speak of his real de- 4    74         BIR;ATHAEI. signs before the simple ones, ere he was ready that such revelations should be made, put me on my guard by show- ing me on what grounds they were following him; that  the order on which they were acting was given by the King under the impression that it was to summon two godly riests to accompany Absalom to Hebron, to sustain him Pith their goodly counsel, while he performed a solemn vow he had made to God in the days of his exile from Jerusalem."  Benaiah's heart fell with a dread foreboding of a coming evil, magnified to him by the mists that yet lay around it. He hastened to enquire: "What can be the Prince's object in using such du- "Simply, Benaiah, to head a rebellion of ten of the tribes of Israel against his father and his King." Reuben paused for a moment, and then continued in thrilling tones: f "The hour of God's vengeance on the murderer of Uriah and the desolator of his hearth draws near! The cup of punishment is not yet fully drained! But, my brother, mis- take me not. While I am bound hand and soul to assist in, the carrying out of this design, in thee, knowingly to join the Prince, t'were treason. It is not too late even now. I will accompany thee to the rear and explain to the captain of Absalom's guard that I will be accountable for thy silence till the hour of action arrives. He will let thee depart uietly, for, fortunately, he is an old comrade of mine, and further knows that I am a known and devoted adherent of Absalom." ' Benaiah shook his head, as he replied in firm tones: "Reuben, it is kindly meant, but I will not return to Je- rusalem. Dread troubles are falling on my, till now, happy country, and I must on, whither the Prince leads." "Benaiah, dear brother, tell me thou art not a rebel to thy King. What it may be right for me to do, is madness! for thee to imitate. Would that my tongue had for ever clove to the roof of my mouth, rather than its utterance, on that unhappy morning on the Hill of Olives, should 'have turned thy young heart from its allegiance to thy rightful sovereign!" 1 "But, Reuben, if thou so desirest Absalom's success in this matter, why not strive to make me his adherent, rather than to dissuade me from joining him?"   GOING TO HEBRON.        75 "Ask me not, my brother. Rather than have thee im- peril thy young, happy life in what, if unsuccessful, will be called rebellion, and its abettors traitors, I will myself with- draw, not in the King's behalf-for him I draw sword no more-but as a mere spectator of the contest." "I cannot in honor claim this sacrifice on thy part, Reu- ben, much as I desire it, for I have not had the slightest intent of swerving from my duty to  King David." "Turn back, then, at once. To-morrow it may be too late." Then, as a sudden thought flashed into his mind, he added in a softer tone:- "Turn back to thy King, and to thy love. She may ere long need thy protection." I "Yes, Reuben, she will need the protection of this right arm, and she shall have it. The King can easily spare me." "But every clatter of thy horse's hoofs is noting thy de- parture from her. Remember, Jerusalem will be besieged. No time, then, is to be lost in seeking for her a haven of safety." Still, to Reuben's surprise, Benaiah drew not rein, but rather seemed to urge his horse to a more rapid pace. Turning towards his brother, with a sad smile, he said: "Miriam is on her way with Ahithophel, to his house in the city of Giloh." Reuben saw how hopeless it would be further to urge his brother to return to Jerusalem. He hastened to do the next best thing in his power. "CC Go, then, to Giloh my dear brother, It were better that thou shouldst leave the road we are now pursuing before we reach Hebron. I will gain the Prince's consent to this arrangement." As if in answer to his purpose, a summons came from Ab- salom for Reuben to join him. Bowing his acquiescence, he hurriedly said to Benaiah: "I shall be known as an open adherent to the Prince, hereafter, and much conversation with me will, therefore, bring suspicion on thee. Let us, then, say farewell once for all, my dear brother. Be not so cast down. Happier times will come for thee, and mayhap for me also. Be firm in thy loyalty to David. In any case it is the most honorable course for thee to pursue. Ahithophel has probably been won over by Absalom, and thy late campanions are almost   76     .iATHUALIAH. sure to follow their father's steps. Go not with them. Again, farewell, dear brother, and may Adonai of Hosts have thee in his holy lkeeping!" The hands of the brothers were clasped in a final em- brace. Benaiah esaayed to speak a few words, but his utter- ance was choked, and before he could recover himself, his brother was riding rapidly away, a cloud of dust half hiding him from sight. Benaiah rode on alone, for he was in no mood to join his gay friends. To force upon himself a manner that would not excite their wonder, he felt for the moment would be impossible. His thoughts, to which he gave full sway, were busy with the strange and startling intelligence he had just heard. But a little while ago, how bright was his life and life's pursuits to him! A voyager over summery seas, with Miriam by his side, wafted on by gales that whispered only of love and happiness. Miriam indeed remained, but now he was battling with her against tempestuous waters. The sun had withdrawn its shining, and where had been light and warmth, the chill shadow of an impending disaster lay. While thus busy with his thoughts, and half unconscious of the immediate surroundings of the present, he was ac- costed by Helem, who informed him that a brief halt was to be made at Libnah, and rallied him for deserting their com- pany to indulge in, of course, happier thoughts. "It was to join Reuben." "Yes, but Reuben left thee a good half-hour ago. No excuses, brother of mine," Helem laughingly continued, "I have had my eye on thee, and would not even now have in- truded on thy pleasant meditations, had it not been to im- form thee of the hasty, but I dare say bounteous repast, the Prince has had prepared for us." Benaiah, willing that Helem should take this cheerful view of his abstraction, joined him, and the two rode on together till they reached Libnah. The stay here was but brief, for the intention of Absalom was that they were to reach the end of their journey that day. Benaiah did not see his brother, but received a message from him that the Prince gave him permission to leave the company at Boskath. From thence he could go on to Ziph, and passing through the wilderness of the same name, reach Giloh, probably as   GOINO TO HEBRON.        " soon as the arrival of the Prince's escort in Hebron. The message was given to him in the presence of Adin and Helem. "What, Benaiah! in such haste to leave us!" exclaimed the latter. "Our father expected tidings from Hebron. Thou wilt only be half welcome!" ' Tell them in Giloh," added Adin, " that we will ride over as soon as we can gain the Prince's permission." "Farewell, then, for the present, Benaiah," said Helem. "But I am not to leave the escort till we reach Boskath," replied Benaiah. "But confess that thou preferest to ride alone," urged Helem. "No ; my wish is to continue what is left of our journey together, just as we left Jerusalem." Miriam's brothers suspected not the hidden meaning con- tained in these words. Nothing of note occurred till the point of separation was gained. To Adin and Helem the parting seemed only for a few days. Benaiah, as he pressed their hands with more than ordinary fervor, saw the gulf that was widening between them. They had parted, perhaps for ever, as brothers-in-arms; so his thouights ran as he pursued his solitary way. He re- membered Reuben's words, and experience told him that his brother never spoke unwittingly. Then came the ques- tion, how would Ahithophel regard his adherence to the King. Would it lead him to throw a perhaps insur- mountable obstacle in the path that led to Miriam and hap- piness? Perplexing question. It occupied his thoughts many a weary mile. At length, from an eminence he reached, he saw the clustering dwellings of Giloh, while beyond, his eye caught the dull glimmer of the Dead Sea. "Away with these sombre thoughts!" thought Benaiah. "Giloh and Miriam first, and then, if need be, the Dead Sea of trouble hereafter!"     78          ATHALIAH             ; CHAPTER XII. THE SISTER'S CONQUEST. THE meeting of Benaiah and Miriam was full with rap. ture; for if even the sight of the city that contained her had inspired Benaiah with the resolve to cast all forebodings from him, the contact of her loving presence made him quite forget them. But his meeting with Ahithophel was the reverse of this: the icy bareness of the mountain compared with the verduous wealth of the valley. The youth knew the posi- tion of the aged counsellor, but dared not avow it; the wily adviser of royalty was ignorant of that of Benaiah, and feared to question him about it. He could not under- stand the object of Reuben, whom he knew to be a zealous supporter of Absalom, in sending his brother to Giloh be- fore the company with which he had started from Jerusalem had reached Hebron. Was it that he might influence him to join the cause of the Prince? He could not ask Benaiah in so many words, whether he was aware of Absalom's real intent in leaving Jerusalem-the very question the young man feared he might ask; and Benaiah on his part had no means of discovering what action Ahithophel would take when he learned, as he soon would, of his unshaken loyalty to the King. The result of the interview was therefore un- satisfactory to each of them. Benaiah, though, had a sweet remedy at hand. Ahithophel was not so fortunate. The day after Benaiah's arrival at Giloh, Adin and Helem came from Hebron. A glance told Benaiah that the latter was still in blissful ignorance of coming events; a lengthy interview which the former held with Ahithophel was suffi- cient ground for supposing that Adin had been informed by Absalom of the real state of affairs. It was with n6little anxiety, then, that he awaited the results of the intelligence brought by Adin, for he doubted not but that his position with regard to the revolt of Absalom formed part of it. He had detected Adin's knowledge of it in the air of con- straint, never before shown, with which he had met him. When Ahithophel met Benaiah, it was with a marked kindness that set at rest the latter's fears., Nothing was   THE SISTERS CONQUEST.       79 said or even hinted of the stern realities that were hourly shaping themselves for the contest that was now inevitable. Benaiah had a hope, though a feeble one, that perhaps the wise counsellor would not take the fatal step of rebellion against the King he had so long and faithfully served; and this hope received a little accession of strength when the time of parting came-a parting which seemed but for a few days, and which involved only a separation of several miles, but which proved to some to be for ever. Ahithophel was to return with Adin and Helem to He- bron. The little preparation needed for so short a journey had been made, and nothing remained but the speaking of the last words. Helem and Miriam were gayly conversing, unconscious of coming evil as the birds, busy with their nest- building in the tree, under whose spreading branches the brother and sister stood. Benaiah, as he looked at them, felt half guilty, as if the ugly secret he held made him a conspirator. He noted, too, that Ahithophel's gaze was fixed upon them, and the feeble hope he had grew stronger as he thought he discerned a wavering of purpose in the counsel- lor's firm features. Softened they certainly were as he beckoned his beloved grandchild to approach him. Ten- derly embracing her, lie placed her hand in Benaiah's, and said to him: "I commit to thy care and keeping, Benaiah, the best and purest treasure I possess." These words were full of import to the young soldier. They told him that Ahithophel approved of the .stand he had taken; but he little thought that the words, the fare- well, the parting glance that told so much, were final. When the travellers reached Hebron, they found Absalom offering sacrifices. It was singular that Ahithophel could delay joining the conspiracy until he had opportunity of judging of its strength by actual inspection. Even up to this time he had not compromised himself. Outwardly he had come a few miles from the city to do honor to his mas- ter's son. Had he not found things to his liking, he could have withdrawn. But Absalom had managed matters so      I well that he could trust to their convincing power. Amasa, David's nephew, was to be the general of Absa- lom's forces. He was a man of great military skill; cer- tainly in David's estimation, for even after this treachery to     him, he made him captain of his host in place of Joab. The number of Absalom's adherents was already large, and hourly increasing. Success seemed no longer doubtful, and Ahithophel, abandoning the cause of his own lineal descend- ent, openly joined Absalom. Ambition lured him on, and he followed her guidance with no feeble, wavering step. Adin had been won over simply by his love and admira- tion of Absalom, and had required only the asking. Helem did not yield so easily; but surrounded on all sides as he was by eager champions of the new cause, every objection he could raise answered by a score of convincing arguments, and finally subjected to the trying ordeal of a gracious re- quest from the princely Absalom himself, he went with the multitude and joined the standard of revolt. Of the " two hundred innocents" who had come with Absalom, the greater number yielded to the current that seemed to sweep everything in its course. A few, however, withstood it like rock. They, of course, were not permitted to return to Jerusalem, but some zealous firiend of threatened royalty among them contrived to have conveyed to David intelligence of what was transpiring. The words that ex- iled our First Parents from Eden were hardly more terrible than these, which rended the heart of the King in telling him of the base ingratitude of the son he loved so well. The first duty Helem was called upon to perform was of a private nature. Ahithophel directed him to ride over to Giloh and inform Miriam of the great changes that were about taking place. It was a mission that Helem did not greatly relish. Under other circumstances he would have been delighted to meet his sister and his friend, but the mo- ment he thought of them and the quiet home at Giloh, things that in Hebron looked right assumed different aspects. He humbly expressed a want of confidence in his. power of placing matters in a proper light before Miriam, and sug- gested that. Adin would perform the work more fittingly. To this Ahithophel firmly answered, "Nay." He had se- lected Helem as the brother best fitted to accomplish the end he had in view. That end was a strange one. He had disregarded the opinion of the King, of the nation, of pos- terity. Fixed and relentless as was his purpose to pursue the way he had marked out, he paused a moment to devise some way in which the intelligence of his desertion of the    King might reach Miriam, so as to place his act in the best light possible. Helem had no alternative left but to obey. Strengthen- ing himself with the reflection that he had only been fol- lowing the example of his grandfather, renowned for his wisdom, and his elder brother, and thousands on thousands of others, everyway his superiors, he started on his mission. He determined to make short work with Benaiah. He would see him first, tell him plainly how matters stood, and if he said much, bring up his brother Reuben. Helem carried out his plan as far as Benaiah was con- cerned. The hearty manner in which he met him, however, caused him to approach the subject a little less defiantly. When Benaiah heard it, he said: "I feared as much, Helem, but, after all, I do not see very well how thou couldst have resisted the influence brought to bear on thee. We are friends and brothers, let what will betide." A hearty embrace followed, which was more expressive than words. "Benaiah, brother, this was not what I expected. Thou hadst a right to upbraid me for deserting the King. It may seem strange to thee that, though I am bound to fol- low Absalom myself, I am glad that thou remainest true to David. But I must see Miriam and tell her; the thought never occurred to me till this moment, Benaiah," and Helem spoke in hopeful, animated tones; " perhaps thou hast told her "- "Not a word," interrupted Benaiah; " she is in utter ig- norance of all this unhappy state of things." "And when didst thou first hear of it?" "Reuben told me on our way to Hebron." "I wish it were all over-I mean my telling Miriam. Why didst thou not tell her, Benaiah?" "I feared to distress her unnecessarily." ( And I do, too, most heartily. But it must be done; but it need not be to-day. My father gave me no command as to that."                   t The remainder of the day was spent happily. Helem succeeded in persuading himself that the next day he would feel refreshed, and that the interview would not be so un- pleasant as he had feared. 4*     82          ATHALIAI.              I The morning came, and Helem thought to put it off till the afternoon. But Benaiah urged him to do it at once, and so managed that they were left alone together. In the light of those clear, deep, soul-lit eyes, Helem began losing what little confidence he had in his power of convinc- ing his sister that the revolt was even excusable. His man- ner became constrained. She, on the contrary, was all affectionate frankness. Uncon- sciously she gave the conversation the very turn to suit her brother's purpose. "And when, dear Helem, does Prince Absalom return to Jerusalem?  "Very soon; in fact, our dear father bade me tell thee to hold thyself in readiness for departure at any moment." "I am glad of that, absence from Jerusalem is exile." Beautiful was the animation with which these words were uttered. 'Thou, dear brother, wilt return with the Prince, I suppose?" "Yes, Miriam. Our father has conquered his prejudice against Absalom, and now really admires him." "Prejudice  Our father is too wise to be governed by that." '"Well, perhaps I am wrong in calling it by that name. Our father was not at one time convinced of the sincerity of his reformation. But he is now." c"And what has convinced him now?" calmly enquired Miriam, little thinking what a very awkward question she was asking. Helem was confused. Dethroning his father, or even at- tempting it, was a singular proof of repentance! But, argued Helem in his own mind, he does that to make the nation happier. Miriam, not receiving an immediate answer, suggested that this pious fulfilment of Absalom's vow in sacrificing to the Lord in Hebron, and there dedicating himself to his service, might have changed their father's opinion. Worse and worse! Even to one so habitually thought- less as Helem, this fulfilment of a vow was but a feint; but he still reasoned in himself, that if Absalom made a good king-and who could doubt it-how could he better serve the Lord?    THE SISTERS CONQUEST.       83 This silence, if longer preserved, would appear very sin- gular, so he answered absently, "Yes, probably." He made up his mind that he must do more ,pf the talk- ing, or Miriam would end by making a convert of him. "Oh! Miriam, one cannot help being won by A-bsalom; he is so handsome, so noble, and yet so gracious; though a King's son, and heir to the throne, I feel as if I could love him like a brother." "Thou forgetst, Helem, Solomon, not Absalom, is heir to the throne." "' Absalom is the oldest son." "But Solomon is the one appointed by God," solemnly and conclusively answered Miriam. "Oh! Helem, would we had no king save God. Our fathers erred grievously in wishing for a king." "Dost know, Miriam," answered Helem, scarcely noticing her concluding exclamation, "that there are some, are many, who doubt this right of Solomon to the crown? Nathan might have been bought "-but as Helem observed the alarmed, almost terrified look of Miriam, he hastily added -" at least might have deceived himself." "Oh! Helem, tell me quickly that thou dost not share the wicked doubts of these) men who pay so little respect to God's holy prophet!"  There was no resisting the look'of earnest, soul-speaking entreaty that welled up in the beautiful eyes of his sister, as laying her hand upon his shoulder, she gazed intently on him. "Oh! no," carelessly answered Helem, " not entirely "- for he could not tell his noble-hearted sister a flat untruth- "but, Miriam, thou wilt confess thyself, that the fact of Ab- salom's being the elder born is more palpable, to say the least, than the fact of God having appointed Solomon the heir to the throne." "Oh, Helem, my beloved brother, into what strange de- lusions art thou drifting!" and tears sprang into Miriam's eyes. "Was not the fact that Ishbosheth was the son of Saul, the anointed King, more palpable than that Samuel, by God's command, had privately anointed David to be King? And yet thou acknowledgest David as the rightful Sove- reign." Helem felt he had gradually been losing ground. He re-     84          ATHALIAH. solved to make one more effort; if that failed, to tell her openly of the whole affair, and bear the outhurst as best he might. "Well, Miriam, thou mayst be right; but in these mat- ters I like to depend upon older and wiser heads." "Will those older and wiser heads rid thee of the un- happy consequences of any imprudent action they might advise?" "Oh! I do not care for the consequences." "Will they, then, be alone answerable for thy sin?"  "If we do what they tell us, and do not mean anything wrong, there cannot be much sin in it." "But, my dear brother, reflect a moment. God has given us each reason. One man does not possess it for two or three others. We are, therefore, each accountable for what we do-whether it is through the influence of others, or by our own will." "Our father," replied Helem, " as thou rememberest, com- manded us to distrust Absalom, and we did. That distrust proved unfounded. We did the Prince an injustice. Who, then, is accountable for that wrong? 5" "Our father had not only good motives in this matter, but good reason for distrusting Absalom. His motive sprang from loyalty to the King; his reasons for doubting the Prince were the natural result of not only that Prince's previous life, but his present mode of living. If wrong was done, the Prince brought it on himself." "Well, now our father advises us to trust to Absalom." "Ah! he only advises." "Well, what difference does that make?" " Much; for when he simply advises, he lays aside the authority of a father, and speaks only as a friend." "And ought we not to respect such advice?" C Most certainly, and follow it, too, if it coincide with our own ideas of right. But, Helem, what is to be the end of this wise discussion? Never do I recollect thee as such a reasoner before." 4 A playful smile was on her face as she said this. I will tell thee the end of this discussion," firmly re- plied Helem, for he had at length nerved himself to a full avowal. "Our father, as I said before, has advised Adin and me not only to trust, but to join Prince Absalom. He 1  THE SISTER S CONQUEST.       85 is collecting an army at Hebron, and is going to march to Jerusalem to take the throne that rightfully belongs to him." The smile that had played on lIiriam's face faded away, and a look of horror took its place. It is said that a man in the act of drowning sees a rapid and vivid delineation of the acts of his life pass before him. Miriamn, as she sank into the sea of troubles thatSere surging around her, had a rapid and clear perception of the events of her past life, which were to add force and intensity to her future sufferings. Her grandfather, so venerated-- her brothers, so fondly loved, were rebels and traitorsagainst the anointed King-God's representative on earth. They were abetting, too, a son in a most impious and horrible en- deavor against a father's peace, if not his life. And Be- naiah--her heart sank even deeper at the thought--where was he? Was he, too, a rebel? He, she had thought so true and loyal to the King! She gasped out, "1Benaiah, is he joined with you?" These were her first words. Helem hastened to pour into her troubled heart the only balm of consolation he possessed. "No, dearest sister. He remains loyal to the King." Helem, in his unselfish love, was willing to appear a rebel that Benaiah might stand out in brighter colors. "His brother Reuben told him of the object of Absalom on our way from Jerusalem; but he risked being thought a traitor that he might be near to defend thee." A  sad, serene expression took the place of horror that had rested on Miriam's face. For the moment' she felt pacified. The eyes, so full, so lustrous, were raised towards Heaven and her lips moved, but no sound issued from her mouth. More eloquent than words could prove, was the language of her heart, when she thanked God for this one alleviation of her sufferings. This simple turning of her heart to God was in itself an appeal for strength, which was not left un- heeded. But soon she thought of the dear brother before her, then of the absent one, then of Ahithophel! As yet they were only rebels in intent. Oh! if she could but save them!  *    f     She threw herself on her knees before her brother. The earnestness of the movement snapped the band that confined the long silken tresses of her hair, and it fell in rich luxuri- ance around her. Her eyes were swimming in tears, her cheek was flushed, its color deepened in contrast with the black hair that half-concealed it. How beautiful, how  touching, was her earnest entreaty!"  "Oh! Helem, beloved brother, let me entreat thee to break at once from this band of evil conspirators." Helem leaned over his sister and attempted to raise her.  He could not speak.  "No, no! Helem, here let me remain till I have persuaded i thee by thy loyalty to the King, by thy love for me, thy  only sister, by the memory of our dear mother's love, nay, by thy duty to Israel's God, to leave this band of evil- doers.          . "But, Miriam, my Fdarling sister, thou seest things in a wrong light. Be more calm. King David is growing old, he cares no longer for the honors of royalty, because they  are encumbered with its burdens. Absalom is his son-nay,  his favorite son. Our father will be his counsellor, and have more influence over him than he ever had over King David." Miriam's only answer was a searching look into her brother's eyes. He felt in his own heart that she detected  the sophistry of his words, still he struggled on.  "But, dear Miriam, after pledging my word, how can I draw back? Thou would'st not have me, a soldier, dishonor myself!? "And whose soldier art thou, Helem? Fearst not to dis- ! honor him, if that were possible, by rising against one he  has anointed? But, Helem, dear brother, thou knowst in thy heart thou art doing wrong. Oh! if only for my sake,  remain faithful to the King, and not the King only, but to  God." Helem was much impressed by his sister's words. What- ever was elevated in his character, had been inspired and strengthened by her. He felt her real superiority. Had she shown anger, he would easily have resisted, but this en- treaty-so loving, so humble, and yet so fervent, greatly moved him. He at length caught the ardor of her noble-heart- ed loyalty. He had little doubt but that Absalom would   THE SISTER'S CONQUEST.      87  succeed in his efforts for the throne, but the danger that might thus accrue to him, if he should now desert the Prince, he disregarded.  And then his noble-hearted sister still kneeled to him, pour- ing out, as it were her very soul in entreaty.         Miriam with heartfelt joy saw her brother waver. She renewed her arguments, her entreaties. "   It is never dishonorable, brother, to desert a dishonorable  cause. Absalom's, in thy heart thou knowst to be such. Benaiah nobly clings to David. Imitate his loyalty." coming hither was to defend thee." Terrible question In her joy at finding that Benaiah was no rebel, Miriam had forgotton one of the most bitter ingre- dients of her cup of sufferings. Would she dare to keep from the King so valiant a soldier as her lover? Could she be so selfish, so lacking in what she considered a sacred duty? Her conscience was clear and decided in itsanswer, and her heart sank within her at the thought of Benaiah being arrayed in battle against her brothers. In the confusion and tumult of the conflict, Adin might fall by Benaiah's hand, or Benaiah by the hand of Adin. Her look of anguish was so acute, she pressed her hands upon her heart with such in- tensity of agony, that Helem was completely won. He clasped his sister in his arms with but one thought, one in- tention: to give up everything to render her less unhappy. Miriam, dear sister, I will do as thou desirest. I will leave Absalom, and serve only the King." Hope, the heaven-appointed combatant of Despair, van- quished this growing feeling in Miriam's heart. She had won [Helem. She would yet win Adin. Then her lover and her brothers would fight, as formerly. for God, and God's Enointed King. And He, to reward her for her efforts, would pare their lives to bless her. Her grandfather she hardly lared think of: but her present feelings were so much less niserable than they had been but a moment since, that she hought herself quite happy. Benaiah at this opportune moment entered. Miriam joy- ,usly met him, and hastily recounted Helem's returning oyalty to the King. She sat between her brother and Be- aiah, each holding one of her hands. Full of hope they alked of their plans. Adin was to be asked to meet them   i i I     at Jezreel, half way between Giloh and Hebron. They did not doubt but that he would come thus far, particularly as Hebron was not, in its present circumstances, a fit place for Miriam to visit. Then she would exert her utmost powers of persuasion. Benaiah had not the slightest doubt of her success. Helem had but little. Mirian looked to God for strength, and felt calm and hopeful. Thus they sat and talked. In the meanwhile a horseman is rapidly approaching Giloh. He bears a letter from Ahitho- phel to Helem. It is as follows: "( David has evacuated Jerusalem. Ere this reaches thee, Absalom's army will be on its way. As we carry no besieg- ing engines, our course will be rapid. Leave Giloh instantly and endeavor to overtake us before we reach Bezek. Tell Benaiah to escort Miriam by easy travel to Jerusalem. It will be the safest place for her. If necessary, she can go from thence to Gibeon.         AHTHOPHEL." Alas! poor Miriam. CHAPTER XIII. "OVE AND LOYALTY. AHTHOPHEL S letter cast a deep cloud over the three late hopeful consultants. It was too late now. Even could Miriam see Adin before he reached Jerusalem, her most earnest efforts, she felt, would prove fruitless. She needed no other evidence than the poorly concealed uneasi- ness of Helem, that he was not with the advancing army. Though young, he had the feelings and instincts of a soldier, and Ahithophel's letter was to him as a trumpet to call him to the field of action. The letter, therefore, drew from him a sigh of longing, for he had yielded to his sister rather from feeling than principle. To Miriam, it sounded like a death- knell. Benaiah thought of his tender and noble-hearted brother for a moment, then of Miriam, and because she was unhappy and miserable, he felt so too. They sat for a few moments, each brooding over their own    "OVE AND LOYALTY.         89 thoughts. Helem, to escape from his, determined to act. Taking a slip of parchment, he traced these words to Ahitho- phel. "HONORED FATHER: I cannot obey thee in joining Ab- salom's army. I have determined to remain loyal to King David.                   HELEM." This he handed to the messenger, telling him to place it in AhithophelPs hand as soon as possible. Then, to seek re- lief from his too busy thoughts, he left the house for a walk in the open fields. After Helem left them, Miriam first broke silence. "Oh! Benaiah, what is to be the end of this dreadful war? Dost think it is King David's intention to submit and give up his crown to Absalom?" "The Lord has commanded him only to give it to Solo- mon. He will defend it to the last." "Yes-yes, I had forgotten," sadly and half absently re- plied Miriam. "But why, then, does he so quickly give up the very stronghold of Israel?" "Dear Miriam! in this I only see great wisdom. Jeru- salem is not provisioned for a siege. King David, by tak- ing the open country, can draw around him all those who still remain faithful to him. Besides, his pious heart cannot endure the thought of having the holy city become the scene of fierce and deadly contest. It would be sacked and pillaged." Miriam shuddered at the idea. She pictured to herself the unhappy and afflicted father thus retreating before a rebellious son; and should she only pity? Could she do nothing? Her duty was clear as sunlight to her-not less so be- cause it conflicted so fearfully with her happiness. Her lover had once refused to return to the King, that he might protect her. It was not, then, simply for her to give him permission tojoin the King. She knew he would refuse to leave her. She would have to urge, to entreat, and to en- treaty add argument. She, whose heart was well-nigh breaking! And where would he go? alas! not merely to fight for the King, but against her brother. If Benaiah fell, he would die nobly, for his King and for his God. But if Adin should'be killed-it might be by her lover-he would die a rebel's death, he would fill a dishonored grave.     90          ATHALIAH.  But the very greatness of the trial carried her through it. She felt herself utterly unable to accomplish it. She called on God, not to assist her, for her strength she counted as nothing, but to give her strength, all the strength that was needed. There came over her spirit a calm, lulling all contending feelings to rest. She seemed to look down on the concerns of the world from some lofty height, and she saw, or seemed to see, that life, in its true intent, was not a pursuit after, nor a struggle for happiness, but simply a fulfilment'of duty. That if, when this duty was fulfilled, the longing desire of our hearts for happiness was not satisfied, it was only a lit- tle longer deferred. That, as the world opened with Para- dise, so it would close, and the suffering, after life's duties all ended, would walk in its peaceful bowers, and talk with God. Little did Benaiah think of the struggle that had been going on in that loving, gentle heart, nor of the Heaven-sent strength that had been communicated. He had been busy speculating as to the probable effects this rebellion of Absa- lom would have on their future happiness. He thought not of his duty to his king. It did not strike him that he was self- ish, for he thought more of Miriam than he did of himself. How different their thoughts! Sitting side by side, their hands fondly clasped, who would have imagined that .their thoughts could have been so different. Miriam raised her head and gazed earnestly into Benaiah's eyes. He lovingly returned her gaze. He saw there only love, where another might have detected the firmness of a high resolve. "Dearest Benaiah; King David is even now waiting for his loyal friends; if thou art one, thou must therefore leave me, and join him." The tones were gentle, yet firm. Benaiah was not wholly unprepared for this. He knew her noble nature would prompt her to this sacrifice. He would take care the sacrifice should not be consummated. "Leave thee, dear Miriam, exposed to the dangers inci- dent to a civil war? Never!" "God will protect me, Benaiah, as well as thee." "God works by means, dearest, and I am the means ap- pointed for thy protection. Helem, perhaps, ought to go. I will not."   MOVE AND LOYALTY.        91 "Thou art right, Benaiah; God does work by means. Now which is the greater, the more important work? The restoration of this anointed King, or the protection of a simple Jewish maiden?" "That Jewish maiden is more to me than King and country. Nay, nay, my darling Miriam,- I know thy noble heart--the struggle it has cost thee thus to urge me to join the King. Thou hast nobly done what thou thoughtest thy duty. Let that suffice. I leave not thy side till these troublesome times are pverpast." "Oh! Benaiah, thou canst not tell what it costs me thus to attempt to awaken thee to thy duty. Yes, duty! it is simply that. When on the battle-field thou art ordered by thy superior officer to meet almost certain death, thou dost not shrink back. The King it is now that commands thee- nay, entreats thee to join his standard." "Miriam," and there was a dash of impatience in' Be- naiah's tones, " did the King or my lord Joab call me to fight the enemies of my country, most willingly would I go. But when I am to confront my own countrymen, the matter is different. Dost forget that in AbsaIom's army thou hast a brother, Adin, and I a brother, Reuben?" "No, no, Benaiah, I do not forget-I cannot forget. I see it all-I feel it all," and Miriam wrung her delicate hands, while tears gushed from her eyes. "But must not duty be fulfilled at all costs? It may be, Benaiah, my heart's first, only choice, that we are not to be happy here. But let us serve God faithfully, and we will be rewarded hereafter." Benaiah pressed to his heart the weeping form of the beautiful girl. He could not resist the eloquence of her tears, yet he was far from yielding to her entreaties. He tried to sooth her by putting off further consideration of the subject till the morrow; he would think of it in-the meantime. She must not be quite so persistent, or he would have some very foolish ideas that she loved her King and country more than she did him. But Miriam was no child to be thus quieted. What was done must be done now. Time pressed; besides, she felt she would not have the strength to revive the subject again. She drove back her tears, and calmly proceeded. "It is not King and country, dear Benaiah, that this re- bellion simply concerns, it is the Lord's cause. Each true     child of Israel's God must use every effort to check this re- volt. If Absalom becomes King, our nation will differ but little from the heathen nations, for our King will be un- anointed, unappointed of God. Look at me, /enatah," and Miriam with sudden energy stood up before her lover. "I am but a poor, weak woman, and yet God has given me strength to say to thee-to thee, my life, my love, my all, to thee, in whom my heart is bound up-go and do battle for the Lord of Hosts. Ah! knowest not that this tears the very fibres of my being to bid thee leave me, yet I say go I! Pray to God, dearest, that He will give you the strength He has imparted to me. We shall be happy yet," and Miriam smiled through the fast-crowding tears that came into her eyes; " if not here, then hereafter." "Miriam, I will obey thee," sadly responded Benaiah, but I fear you are sacrificing our happiness to a mistaken sense of duty." "Dear Benaiah, we can never be happy unless in perform- ing duty. If we neglect it for the sake of being happy in our own way, God will dash the cup of happiness from our lips when we think to drink it." "But, Miriam, what of thy safety? How can I leave thee?" "Thou dost but magnify the danger. I have here Rachel and Benjamin, besides other servants. They are wholly de- voted to me. We can go to Jerusalem or to Gibeon." "Adin and Reuben?" -simple enquiry, but how much did it involve. Miriam hesitated but for a moment. Then taking from' her head a silk scarf, she tore it into four strips. "Look, Benaiah, I will see that Adin and Reuben have each one of- these. Thou and Helem wilt take the other parts, and fasten them to your helmets; you can thus re- cognize each other-"She suddenly stopped. A terrible vision of the battle-field rose up before her. She seemed to see Benaiah wounded, dying-the fragment of her scarf she gave him dyed in his blood. Her brain reeled, objects swam before her eyes, and she sank fainting into her lover's arms.   A HDDEN LIFE.         93 CHAPTER XIV. A HDDEN LIFE. EARLY the next morning' a small party, consisting of Helem, Miriam, and Benaiah, and the household servants of Ahithophel, left the city of Giloh with the intention of reaching Gibeon in as little time as their means of travel rendered it practicable. To carry into execution Miriam's plan, by which the brothers were to recognize each other, should they chance to meet in battle, Benjamin was to pro- ceed to Jerusalem, and seek his master's son Adin. He was well known as the confidential servant of Ahithophel, and would, therefore, find no difficulty in gaining access to the royal city. He was not to leave the little band, however, till they were near Jerusalem, and after fulfilling his mission was to go at once to Gibeon. The fresh air and wakening light of early morning did   t not fail to produce a favorable effect upon the spirits of the three who led the party. Benaiah and Miriam, in anticipa- tion of a two days' constant companionship, with all its wealth of happy thoughts and feelings, cared not to look beyond to the hour of a bitter, perhaps final parting, and like children they enjoyed the present with hearts too full to admit dark forebodings of the future. Helem was not so much absorbed in the present, bpt that he had ample opportunity of glancing at the future; %but as the bright sunlight lay all around him, so on the scenes to come his fancy shed the brightness of youthful spirits, and a never-dying hope. His separation from Adin, and worse still, the fact of their fighting under opposing banners, was a cloud on his horizon not easy to dispel, but he found its silver side. "If the King's cause triumphs," he reasoned, "I will be in a position to procure favor for Adin; and if the Prince succeeds, Adin can do the same for me." There is one other of this group of travellers who de- serves more than a passing notice. She rides apart by her- self-not from pride: the dejected look she wears gives no hint of that; neither is it because she would enjoy pleasant thoughts uninterrupted, for the sad expression on her face, which scarce ever leaves it, forbids any such idea. Shrink-     V4          ATHALIAH. ing from companionship, when duty permits it, is habitual with her. She is a mystery in the household, -Occupying a middle place between a servant and companion to Miriam, her educa- tion and inherent refinement lifting her above the former 1 class, while her extreme reserve debarred her from avail- i ing herself of the advantages of the latter position, she leads an isolated life in the minds of a numerous family. : What is really known of her is easily told. Before enter- i ing Miriam's service, Zillah had been an inmate of Rebekah's V house. As she could both read and write Hebrew, besides having an intimate knowledge of the Egyptian and Arabic -the latter being her native dialect-she occupied a very i desirable position in the family of one who could so fully appreciate accomplishments that were by no means common even among the women of Israel.              i During her residence in Rebekah's house she embraced the Jewish religion and became a proselyte, sincerely re- i gretting that her birth prevented her from a full partici- pation in its rites. That it was from no unworthy motive she made this profession (for it exalted her very much in Rebekah's favor), was evident from the fact that, not long afterwards, she gave up her place, with all its advantages, and sought for even menial service in the household of Ahitho- 1 phel. To Rebekah she gave no reason for this strange step. An orphan with none to control her choice, it seemed mere ca- price on her part. Arguments were as unavailing as the liberal inducements Rebekah added, and at length the proud mistress dismissed the unyielding, yet sad and unhappy maid, inanger. She bore it patiently, and breathed a prayer she feared to utter, for Rebekah's peace. When Miriam   learned the simple story of this lone maiden's life, her sympathies were at once aroused. Admimr- ing Zillah's attainments, touched by the pensive beauty of her face and the refinement of her manner, she determined.,  to win smiles from sadness and implant peace in the sorely  troubled heart. But gentle as were her advances, patient and well-directed her efforts, all proved futile to overcome Zillah's reserve. Miriam with painful surprise saw that her endeavors to raise Zillah from her despondency seemed only to distress   A HDDEN LIFE.         95 her, and she was therefore obliged to content herself with making her position in-the house as pleasant to her as possi- ble, hoping that time might bring about some opportunity of doing her a greater good. Two years passed, and yet Zillah was outwardly the same as when she first entered the house. None could be more exemplary in conduct or more faithful in the discharge of duty. "What can this secret burden in her heart be?"Miriam often asked herself, but always in vain. "Was it the result of some fault or sin of her own, or of others? Surely not her own, for such humility and penitence as hers must long since have secured her peace. If the baleful influence come from without, whence its source?"She was never known to hold communication with any except the household of Ahitho- phel, and yet the cause of her unhappiness seemed active; for time, which heals all life's sorrows, seemed here to pro- duce no effect. As the little troop neared Jerusalem, Benjamin left it with ample instructions how to proceed in the mission to which he had been appointed. He was to proceed with haste to the holy city, find Adin and Reuben, give them the pieces of Miriam's scarf, with injunctions to fasten them to their helmets in all the battles in which they might be engaged, adding the information that the helmets of Benaiah and Helem would be alike decorated. He was also to learn, as far as possible without exciting too much suspicion, the movements of the rebel forces. Miriam was not aware that Benjamin had left the troop till they were leaving Jerusalem behind them. Benaiah, careful of causing her any undue pain, had left her in conversation with Helem, and making some excuse had fallen back to the rear, and reiterating his instructions to Benjamin had dis- missed him on his errand. They had not proceeded very far, when they heard-behind them the rapid clattering of a horse's hoofs, and looking back, beheld, to their surprise, Adin riding to overtake them.   b     96          ATHALIAH. CHAPTER XV.  THE GOOD COUNSEL DEFEATED.         R EVEN this meeting with sister and brothers could not dis.  pel the gloom and sternness that seemed fixed upon Adin's face. In answer to their first enquiries whether he had seen Benjamin, he replied that he had met him outside of the city's walls, and hearing of the circumstances that had brought him to Jerusalem, had immediately started after i them, leaving him to find out Reuben in the city.    1 Never had these four met under such circumstances. There was a restraint that seemed to bind in icy fetters all I cordial interchange of feeling. Helem, as being the least 1 thoughtful, felt it the least. Something must be said, and : though he half feared Adin's evident anger was all for him, I; he determined to be the spokesman of their party. But Miriam spake first. "Dear Adin, how is our beloved father?" Adin did not immediately reply, but the stern expression of his countenance only increased. At length he muttered: "Dishonored! disgraced." "How dishonored!" angrily exclaimed Helem, "and by whom?" and his hand clutched the hilt of his sword. Miriam turned pale and reached out her hand to her lover as if for support.        :           / "One above thy vengeance," moodily answered Adin.    "As my soul liveth," exclaimed Helem, but before he  ' could give utterance to his words, Benaiah called his atten- tion to Miriam, whose face wore a sad expression of entreaty. He understood it, and in milder tones requested his brother to recount what had happened. "Tell us at once, Adin," said Benaiah, c what relates to Ahithophel. Is he well and is he still in Jerusalem?" 1"He is well in body, but he is not now in Jerusalem. Last night he started unattended for Giloh. You must have missed each other on the road.  This morning I found this in my room," and Adin produced a small slip of parchment, on which these words were written: "Adin, I leave thee as a rich legacy this advice. Aban- don Absalom's cause. It is worse than hopeless! I start   THE GOOD COUNSEL DEFEATED.      97 this night for Giloh. If I fail to meet Miriam and Helem, bid them farewell for me.      AHTHOPHEL." There was a hidden significance in this language that eluded the observation of those most deeply concerned. "And why this sudden disaffection to Absalom," ex- claimed Helem. "Because Absalom has played the fool, and disregarded our father's counsel. Had he followed it he would now have been King." "Explain thyself," said Benaiah. sC Now that we are as- sured of our father's personal safety, give us a detailed ac- count of events since thy return to Jerusalem." "Upon entering Jerusalem," resumed Adin, " as you are aware, we met with no resistance. We found many of the citizens who preferred staying in the city to following the deposed King. In fact, many looked upon David's actions as a virtual acknowledgment of Absalom's claim." "Dost so regard them, Adin?" calmly enquired Be- naiah. "Not now: At first I partly thought so. We found the ark of the covenant in the city with Abiathar and Zadok, and learned that David had carried it with him as far as "he top of the Hill of Olives, but had then sent it back." "What caused him thus to change his mind," timidly en- quired Miriam, whose gentle eyes were tear-filled at the thought of the afflicted state of the King. "The reason he gave himself to Zadok was somewhat re- markable. I heard Zadok repeat them to Absalom, and can give the exact words, if thou wishest, my dear Miriam." There was more of gentleness in Adin's tones as he ad- dressed his sister. 4 I do most heartily desire to hear them.'" Adin resumed. "They are as follows: ' Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again and show me both it and his habitation. But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee: behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.' "' Tears silently coursed down Miriam's face. Helem won- dered at the King's words, and Benaiah thought of the inter- view he had held with his brother on that very hill-side, and enquired:     98          ATHALIAH  "Was my brother Reuben present when Zadok told this to Absalom?" "He was, and I noted that Absalom looked significantly towards him. He replied to the look by saying in a low tone, ' God will not delight in him.' I saw the priest's eye flash, but he said nothing." Miriam, buried in her reflections, did not hear the part Reuben had taken in this interview.           j Adin continued. "We found Hushai, the King's favorite, in the city, who hastened to pay his allegiance to Absalom. This surprised the Prince, as he had always looked upon him as the most devoted friend King David had. It was plain to see that Absalom was very much gratified, and yet he taunted Hushai for his desertion of the King."  ' That was to draw him out," suggested Benaiah. "What  reply did he make?"   - "That he was the rightful King to whom God had given success, and whom the men of Israel had chosen. That as he had served the father, so would he serve the son." , But what was the counsel of our father, that Absalom so foolishly rejected?" enquired Helem. "Our father seemed to distrust such sudden and easy suc- cess," pursued Adin, "' and advised that a sudden and decisive i V blow be struck. Amasa, the general of Absalom's forces, was absent from the city, collecting and leading on fresh forces. Our father, therefore, rather than wait for his re- - turn, offered to lead twelve thousand men against David, and overthrow him, before he could get together what sol- l diers he had still at his command." Adin refrained from saying that the simple intent of Ahithophel was to slay the King, and thus terminate the war. ' But Absalom did not follow this advice?" enquired Be- naiah. "At first he, with all the elders of Israel, consented to it, and just as our father was about to put his plan into imme- diate execution, Absalom faltered, and called for Hushai, the Archite, and asked his opinion. Fool! What did Hushai, a man of peace, know of war? Had Absalom but followed our father's advice, Absalom would now be the King, and this unhappy affair ended." "What said Hushai?" enquired Benaiah.   THE GOOD COUNSEL DEFEATED.      99 "Much, too much," moodily answered Adin. ' Compli- menting our father on his proverbial wisdom, in the next breath he said, 'but his advice at this time is not good!' He then alluded to the military skill and valor of David, and the well-tried bravery of the soldiers with him. That to this valor was added the incentive that everything was staked upon it. "Besides, thou wilt not be able to capture the King," he added, " he will hide himself in some pit or cave. In a first engagement with David's veteran troops, thou must be overcome, and such an influence as this defeat will exert on Israel will prove fatal to thy cause." He then counselled that any engagement should be deferred till. all the forces were gathered together that Amasa was now con- centrating. Then certain victory would be the result. And this was the advice that Absalom decided to follow." "I am sorry, Adin," frankly replied Benaiah, " that we are so separated in interest, that what is a source of annoy- ance to thee can but be a gratification to us." "But," hastily added Miriam, " you are not now separated. Adin will follow our father's advice, and abandon this un- holy cause." "No," gloomily replied Adin, "I have gone too far to draw back. Nay, nay, Miriam! I know all thou wouldst say. In a few moments I must retrace my way to Jeru- salem. The probability is that there will be one decisive engagement. Let us dismount and say farewell." Benaiah assisted the trembling Miriam to dismount. She threw herself into Adin's arms. She spoke not, but there were volumes of earnest entreaty in her beautiful face. Adin scarcely allowed himself to look at her. Pressing his lips to her pale forehead, he placed her half-fainting into Be- naiah's arms. "Benaiah," and his voice was husky with emotion, " thou must protect her. God bless thee! Helem, dear brother, farewell!" A cordial embrace followed, and the next moment Adin had mounted and was riding rapidly towards Jerusalem.     100         ATHALTAH. CHAPTER XV. THE RETREAT FROM JERUSALEM. GREAT was the consternation among the citizens of Je- rusalem, when the news first came from Hebron that Absa- lom was in open revolt, and at the head of a large force, that was hourly increasing. Greater still the fear when David gave order to the troops that happened to be with i him, and to his palacesguard, to evacuate the city. We have seen the manner in which King David sent back the ark of the covenant. Never was King so cast down, so sadly afflicted! How that one great sin of his life rose up before him in this time of his adversity. Probably while thinking of this, the thought occurred to him, "What right have I thus to remove this ark of the covenant from the holy city?"He sent it back and went up the Mount of Olives, barefoot and weeping, and covered with the penitent's garb of sackcloth. But while David thus submitted himself piously to the will of God, his submission was not the result of a despair- a ing indolence. He exerted himself to the utmost to retain possession of his throne. God had anointed him, and he rightly determined that, as far as lay in his power, man should not dethrone him. His evacuation of the city was a mere stroke of policy. He not only sent back the priests Zadok and Abiathar, to play the spy in the enemy's camp, but instructed his favorite Hushai to intrude into the coun- cils-f Absalom, and give advice in accordance with his own  interest.                        i He had not at first suspected the disaffection of Ahitho- i phel, and did not heat' of it till he left the city. Instead, then, of denouncing the treachery of his late counsellor, he merely prayed that the Lord would turn his counsels into foolishness. God was pleased to answer this prayer in a different manner from what he desired. And did not Bathsheba, as she ascended the mount, lead- ing Solomon, then about ten years old, think of her dishon- ored-her murdered husband? An event now occurred that proved that David thought in his heart that he should retain his crown. Ziba, the ser-   THE RETREAT FROM JERUSALEM.     101 vant of Mephibosheth, Jonathan's crippled son (his de- formity a sad memento of the terrible overthrow of SauD, met David when they had just passed the summit of the Mount of Olives. He had with him a present for David, consisting of two asses laden with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a like number of sum- mer fruits, and a skin of wine. Upon hearing of Mephibo- sheth's disaffection to him, he immediately confiscated his estate in Ziba's favor. Strange inconsistency of the human heart! He thus pun- ishes the son of the dearest, truest friend he ever had on earth, simply on the word of one who was benefitted by the story he told. Soon after, on the King's approach to Bahu- rim, one of Saul's descendants, named Shimei, came out and boldly cursed David; and still more, threw stones at him and his people. And this, too, when David's soldiers were passing on either side of him. When Abishai, who in Joab's absence commanded the troops, made the simple request to take off Shimei's head, David refused. But Shimei did not stop; he persisted in his cursing and stone-throwing with perfect impunity. It was evidently the wonderful boldness of Shimei that saved him. He was no vulgar railer. He took his life in his hand, and he must have known it. He was probably an enthusiast, who -for many years had been brooding over what he regarded the wrongs of his family, and now, think- ing that the day of retribution had come, was satisfied to see it and end his days. David looked upon him as inspired of God to curse him. When time proved that this revolt of Absalom was more a discipline than a punishment, David changed his mind, and left a codicil in his will to Solomon, that boded little com- fort to this son of Gera. While David tarried to refresh his people and himself, near the banks of the Jordan, Ahimaaz and Jonathan, sons of Zadok and Abiathar, came with haste, and demanded in- stant audience of the King. They were immediately ad- mitted. They told the King that Ahithophel had advised Absalom to pursue the King immediately with twelve thousand men, offering to lead them himself. That Hushai had given con- trary advice, and though Absalom had assented to it, Hushai     102         ATHALIAH. feared he might change his mind, and therefore he advised the King to place himself and forces in a position of safety. They also informed the King that, though they had received the message at the Fuller's Fountain, outside the city walls, from a girl who had come out ostensibly to wash some clothes, yet they were pursued by Absalom's servants. They had taken refuge in the city of Bahurim, where a woman had so ingeniously and effectually concealed them, that though the soldiers tracked them to the very house, they failed to discover them. David immediately gave orders to place the river Jordan between him and his foes. Before morning they had all safely crossed the river. David determined to make Mahanaim his head-quarters, and thitherward he marched with his little army. The city of Mahanaim was in the tribe of Gad, and was about sixty miles northeast from Jerusalem. Here Jacob, on returning to the land of his nativity with his wives and children, met a host of angels, and to commemorate this event gave the name of Mahanaim to the spot upon which afterwards grew up the city. The name signifies "two armies." The angels that appeared to Jacob were probably drawn up like two armies for his defence and encourage- ment. From this fact he might have got the idea of divid- ing his caravan into two bands, when he heard Esau was coming to meet him with" four hundred men. Here also, at a much later period, was the head-quarters of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, who, with Abner as his gen- eral, contended the crowns against David for over seven years. These two events must have been brought strikingly be- fore David as he entered the city, and both of them would have had a tendency to encourage him; the first remind- ing him of God's peculiar care over his chosen ones, the latter recalling a part of his own experience when God had won for him the throne he had long before promised. But it was not simply in the memory of the past that David found encouragement. More material cause awaited him. He had not been long in Mahanaim before he received ample contributions of all things necessary for his present wants. "Beds and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and,   THE RETREAT FROM JERUSALEM.      103 lentiles, and parched pulse, and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine." Honey was among the articles of food a rare luxury, and only seen upon the tables of kings and great persons. The contributers of the most important aid, for it is as ne- cessary to well feed an army, as to well arm it, were Ma- chir, who bred up Mephibosheth till David sent for him, Bar- zillai, and what was most touching, Shobi completed the list, an Ammonite, whose people had received the severest punishment at the hands of David. His father had been Wing of the Ammonites, and it is probable Shobi now reigned in the place of his brother Hanun, whom David slew for offering such indignities to his ambassadors, whom he had sent with messages of condolence and sympathy in consequence of the death of Naharh, father of Hanun. It will be recollected that, swayed by bad advisers, the newly throned King put the sharp affront upon David's messengers of peace and good will, by depriving them of one-half their beards, and cutting off their garments. The latter curtailment could be easily remedied; but the ridiculous appearance of faces, one-half shaven and the other half ornamented with a flowing beard, could only be done away with time. The deserted city of Jericho offered a suitable place for the insulted ambassadors to conceal themselves. A fierce war, into which the Lynans were drawn, was the fatal consequence of this silly freak of Hanun. Shobi has- tens, when the opportunity offers, to make the best atone- ment in his power for the wrong once perpetrated by his house. Serviceable as was his aid, it must have added a keen pang to the sufferings of David, that, while fleeing from his own son, he received kindness and assistance at the hands of a heathen stranger.     104         ATHALIAI. CHAPTER XVIL AHTHOPHEL. WHLE the King thus made his sad retreat from Jerusa- lem, his way cheered by such faint gleams as the aid and sympathy of the few who adhered to him cast upon it, but which, unseen to mortal eyes, was flooded with Heaven's light-for the humility, the penitence, the sublime trust in God which the afflicted David evinced had already se- cured his future success-the capital city of the nation was filled with his rebellious subjects, and, bitterest of thoughts! led on by his beloved son Absalom. Surrounded by such numbers, and Jerusalem in his pos- session, the Prince deemed success all but certain. The in- toxication resulting from such a brilliant triumph-so much gained at so little cost-gave additional strength to Hushai's argument. Absalom was nothing loth to enjoy the glare and glitter of his newly-acquired greatness. He thought he had already won the goal, that he was King, and all that remained was to put down the faction that disputed his au- thority. Jerusalem was given up to hilarity and joy. It was the birthday of the new kingdom. No thought of the hereafter prevailed, no distrust that the promises so lavishly made would not be fulfilled. Jubilant as was the city, it at length sinks to rest. The streets are deserted, lights vanish from the casements. The gates have long been closed, and the drowsy guards half slumber at their posts. Towards the early morning hours, just as the stars are paleinginthe sky, a solitary traveller approaches the gate of Benjamin. He demands instant egress, which is refused by the soldier who answered the summons. "Call thy officer," is the haughty response. The officer appears, and bowing low to the stranger, gives orders that the gate be immediately opened. "Will my lord require a guard to attend him on his journey?" A negative reply, more by impatient gesture than by words, is given.   AHTHOPHEL.         105 The gate swings on its hinges, and the traveller, mounted on an ass, pursues his way. To the surprised and enquiring look of the soldier, the officer replied: "It is Ahithophel. He is in high favor with our new King Absalom, and is doubtless going on some important mission. Observe strict secrecy." Along the road leading to Hebron, Ahithophel journeys in the dim light of breaking day, his head bowed on his breast, leaving to the instinct of the animal that bore him the conduct of the way. Not many days before, he had traversed that same road. Then it was thronged, and the air, now so hushed, was heavy with the tramp of mailed men, the clattering of horse- hoofs, and all the confused sounds that attend the march of an army. But not more changed the scene than the feelings and for- tuhes of this solitary man. But a few days previous he had ridden at the head of that Mighty host, by the side of the princely Absalom, its leader. Success then seemed within his grasp. Only one danger he feared: the reconcilia- tion of the kingly father and his beloved son; and in viee- of this his busy brain had devised a scheme by which the breach already formed could be made an impassable gulf. This scheme had been accomplished. Then certain indi- cations had convinced him that, for the complete success of the rebellion, a sudden onslaught involving the death of the King was necessary; so necessary, in fact- that in the ab- sence of Amasa, he offered himself to lead the twelve thou- sand he deemed sufficient for the purpose. This, too, wasr on the point of being put into execution, when by some strange infatuation Absalom listened to and favored the contrary advice of Hushai, the Archite. A strange rivalry! The counsellor and the favorite of the late King, striving for the favor of the new one. Neither could accuse ae other of treachery to the former master, or throw discretion the sincerity of the new professions. And yet Ahithophel's keen eyes discerned that Hushai was not the traitor to David he appeared-was not the friend to Absalom he professed to be. That Absalom would fail to follow counsel so clearly to his interest as that which Ahithophel gave him, never entered the calculations of the wise counsellor. When everything 5*     UDO          ATHALIAI .             F promised a successful voyage to the haven of his ambition, disaster came from a point he had thought impossible, and he saw only shipwreck while far from shore. No hope of safety now! Even if by some accident Ab- salom should achieve success, he felt he should be discarded and the post he had aimed for given to another. But if the rebellion was crushed, as seemed most likely now, his fate was certain. Now, when too late, he reflected that by adhering to David, let the worst come, he would still have retained his honora- ble name. No disaster or reverse could have tarnished that. The journey to his house in Giloh was a long one, but his ' reflections, however they might diverge at times, all termi- nated in one dread point-that he had played the part of a fool. He whose wisdom was proverbial, which had enabled him to build up such a princely reputation, now by a single j error lays it even with the dust. The thoughts that wandered away to others-to his grand- children, whom he loved-were feeble, and fell overrun by the fiercer thoughts that centred on himself. Their comfort and advancement had been but a minor object with him- mere adornments to the solid structure his ambition was rearing. That fallen, home with all its allurements, perished with it. Ahithophel draws near his house in Giloh. How changed appears its aspect. It seems to him as inanimate as the heavy waters of the Dead Sea, barely visible in the dis- tance.  There are herds of cattle dotting the far-off pas- tures, but they bring no ideas of life or increase to the clouded mind of their possessor. Jabez, left in charge of the house, answers the master's I summons for admittance.  To his exclamation of surprise, Ahithophel answers by a frown.  To his offer of such re- freshments as he can prepare at the moment, he is told by the dusty traveller that he needs nothing but rest, and that on no account must he be disturbed. Twilight deepens into night, and for many hours Jabez keeps faithful vigil, expecting to be called. At length sleep overcomes him, and when he awakens it is broad day. He goes as near the room his master occupies as he dares, but there is no indication that his services have been required. He then hastily prepares such things as he thinks may be   AHTHOPHEL.          107 wanted, and waits. Slowly the sun moves up the sky until it reaches its greatest height. Jabez at length becomes alarmed for his master's safety. Something must have occurred, and at the risk of incurring Ahithophel's anger he determines to seek him. His timid summons for admittance to the room is unheeded. He grows bolder and makes noise enough to rouse an ordinary sleeper. Still no response from the hushed apartment, save the fhoes his sounds have awakened. At length he opens the door  From the threshold he can see nothing of his master, and he therefore enters the room with careful tread. The stillness, so profound, is suddenly startled by a cry of terror. From a stronghookwhichformerly supported a bed canopy, Jabez has discovered his master hanging by the neck. The distorted features, turned towards him, reveals the fearful truth that life has for ever fled. A table stood near, on which lay several scrolls of parch- ment. It had answered a double purpose. Ahithophel had probably spent the greater part of the night in writing di- rections for his surviving relatives-putting his house in order-and then from that very table stepping into eternity. Jabez, after satisfying himself that life is really extinct, hastens for assistance. The rope is severed, and the cold, stiffened form falls heavily into the strong arms of the herd- men who had been called in. An hour later and Jabez is on his way to Gibeon, to carry the sad news to Miriam and the household there. On his arrival he first finds Rachel, and telling her all the sickening details of the sad affliction, leaves it to her judgment to break the intelligence to her mistress. There is no gradations from a blissful ignorance to the sorrowing knowledge ofWa-great grief. No matter how great the care, how deep the tenderness and love of those who undertake this saddest of all services, the unhappy hearer plunges at once from the heights of peace to the depths of sorrow, it may be of despair. If jthe intellect only were to be dealt with, the case would be otherwise; but the heart is so subtle in its apprehensionsJ of danger to its peace, that ere you have taken a single step in what you call u preparation," you are obliged to tell the worst at once, to save your friend from a suspense that often magnifies the dread reality.     108          ATHALIAI,  So it was with Rachel. She lacked neither tenderness nor judgment, but at the very first hint she cast out of sorrow in reserve for her mistress, Miriam was so terrified, so haunted with a score of terrible visions, that Rachel, with an abrupt- : ness which she a little previously would have regarded as ! brutal, had told her of the sad event, reserving only the I manner of Ahithophel's death.             !: Miriam's grief was intensified by the fact that her grand- father had died disloyal to the anointed King. His death, too, had been sudden, and his last moments uncheered by any of those who so loved and venerated him. ' Oh! my father, my poor dear father, to die alone, with no kind hand to smooth thy dying pillow, or listening ear to catch thy last words," was the burden of Miriam's plaintive sorrow. With reflection, however, came the never-failing consola- tion that God has linked to each sorrow in this mortal life, for those who, amid all its vicissitudes, acknowledge Him as the Great Disposer of events. The next day a little cavalcade, composed of some friends of the ex-counsellor, whom Miriam directed should be made acquainted with her grandfather's decease, and a few of her household servants, left Gibeon for Giloh. Miriam was the only one of Ahithophel's descendants that followed his re- mains to their final resting-place in his father's sepulchre. And thus ended the career of Ahithophel. Endowed with a wisdom that had grown to be a proverb in Israel, and which had raised him to a position next the throne in honor, if not in kingly favor, what a happy influence he might have exerted, what an honorable name left to his descendants as a rich legacy, if his guiding star had been duty--not am- bition. His life might have ended like the setting of a great sun. It went out like the smoking snuff of a candle. CHAPTER XVIIL THE KING IN MAHANAIM. THE city of Mahanaim was all activity and excitement. Every daybrought in fresh adherents to David; and when   THE KING IN MARANAIM.       109 Joab at length arrived, at the head of a considerable force, a military encampment was formed outside the city's walls, as the city could not accommodate the unusual numbers that now flocked towards it. No person showed greater activity than the King. All his military habits and instincts were thoroughly revived. His army was to be wholly re-organized. The wide-spread dis- affection to his cause hadl reduced it to a mere skeleton of what it had been. This disaffection extended among the officers as well as the men. Absalom, with forces greatly out-numbering the King's, had crossed the Jordan, and was now encamped in Gilead. David had selected the most favorable position in which to give them battle, reasoning that as their superior numbers would give them greater confidence, he could draw them to en- gage his forces at the point he had selected. Time proved he had rightly calculated. The King set apart a certain time each day to receive the calls of those who had left Jerusalem with him, to follow his fortunes, or share his misfortunes,.as the case might prove. The hurried nature of the retreat prevented him from even knowing, by the way, who really adhered to him. It was something more, then, than mere policy which had induced the King thus to snatch time from more pressing, if not more important duties, to give his friends an opportunity of expressing in words, as they had already done by acts, their loyalty to him. It was to an audience of this kind that Ethni conducted his mother, soon after their arrival in Mahanaim. He had not seen Rizpah since that eventful evening when he had taken the resolution that was to alter the whole tenor of his life. Rebekah had become somewhat reconciled to what she saw was inevitable, and the sudden turn in events which brought the profession of the soldier into such prominence and importance still further induced her to look upon the present position of affairs, as far, at least, as they regarded her son, with contentment. But the old relations of love and confidence that had ex- isted between mother and son had been so rudely shaken, that they were beyond perfect restoration. Her trust in the obedience of Ethni was for ever lost. She felt he was drift-     ing away beyond the power of her control. This was but natural, she could not help acknowledging to herself, but there was something still worse to apprehend, that he might get beyond the power of her love. There was a mystery she could not solve, and would hardly- have dared attempt the task. Her wisest, yet saddest course, was to shut her eyes and wait for what time had in store for her. The walk they took to reach the King's house, though brief, was not without an incident to remind her of the mystery that enveloped Ethni's late action. She noticed first, while leaning on his arm, he gave a sud- den start. Looking in his face, she saw his eyes fixed on some object with an intenseness that evinced much more than mere curiosity. Following the direction of his gaze, Rebekah saw a woman just entering the vestibule of a house not far distant, That this womanuwas the cause of her son's perturbation, Rebekah did not doubt. Who was she? One who like themselvs had fled with the King from Jerusalem, for Ethni could have no acquaintance in Mahanaim. But what else? Was this a clue to her son's sudden and mysterious resolve to embrace the military profession? Easy enough to fol- low it up, had she dared, for the house into which the woman had entered was not difficult to identify. As they passed it she noticed that Ethni regarded it with a scrutiny as if he, at least, determined to know it again. Rebekah said nothing, and when Ethni spoke it was of some indifferent matter. that pertained to the errand they were on. There was quite a number in the audience-chamber of the King when Rebekah and Ethni entered it. David at once recognized them, and advanced a few steps to meet them. His greeting was cordial, and when the King thanked her for the aid she had given him, in relinquishing her plans for her son, and permitting him to enter the army, at a time when he so much needed the loyal hearts and the strong arms of every true son of Israel, the flush which tinged her cheek was partly the result of -confusion at the undeserved praise, and proud pleasure at this public acknowledgment of an obligation conferred on royalty. "I take great pleasure, Rebekah, in confirming the appoint- ment of Joab in making thy son one of his order-bearers.   THE KING IN MAHANAIM.       Il The son of so worthy a mother must needs prove a valua- ble adherent to our cause." Then, without waiting for any verbal acknowledgment to his words, the King turned somewhat abruptly to Sheva, the scribe, who was writing at a table in the corner of the room, and enquired if he had yet recorded the name of IBenaiah, the son of Ahaziah, as remaining loyal to his cause, adding, "he was soon to have been betrothed to Miriam cousin to the Queen Bathsheba." "I have not, my lord the King. I heard that he accom- panied the Prince Absalom to Hebron, in company with Mi- riam's two brothers."  "Alas! I fear he has been led by the evil counsel of Ahithophel to turn traitor to his King. He was a brave young soldier-" Suddenly across the features of the King glowed, like sunshine, a pleasant smile, for at that moment Benaiah en- tered the room, as if in answer to the question David had just put to Sheva. With him was Helem. There was something marked and touching in the rever- ent homage they paid to the King as they approached him. It was like a new acknowledgment of his authority, though he was a fugitive from his capital city. Rebekah, on glancing at Ethni, saw that his face was clouded with displeasure. Other eyes were fixed on him than those of motherly interest and affection. A woman, richly dressed and of surpassing beauty, whose acquaintance Rebekah had acknowledged, on entering the audience-cham- ber, in a cold and distant manner, was regarding the scene with much more intentness than mere curiosity would war- rant; herself unwatched, yet keenly watching. Very cordial were the greetings of the King to the young men who had so feelingly testified their loyalty and devo- tion to him. Explanations quickly followed on their part. Helem, with a noble frankness, confessed that though he had accompanied Absalom to Hebron without knowledge of the Prince's real intent, yet had afterwards wittingly joined his standard; and that he had finally been won back to loyalty before taking any active share in the rebellion, by the argu- ment and entreaties of his sister Miriam. Benaiah had a somewhat better account to give of him- self, as he had not been disloyal even in intent, but imitat-     1 li         ATHALIAH. ing the frankness of Helem, he also confessed that it re- quired the earnest entreaties of Miriam to exchange the character of her personal protector, for that of a defender of the anointed King.:* "Noble-hearted Miriam!" exclaimed David; "she shall not go unrewarded for such unselfish devotion! But, He- lem, where is thy brother Adin?" "I regret to say, my lord the King, that he is in Prince Absalom's service. I believe he joined him out of pure love and admiration, and now adheres to him, contrary to our father Ahithophel's advice, from the same motives." "Contrary to Ahithophel's advice?" interrogated the King, with much surprise. "Yes, my lord the King," replied Helem. "On our way to Gibeon, whither we were escorting Miriam and our house- hold servants, Adin overtook us soon after we had passed Jerusalem on the east, having been informed of our nearness to that city by one of our men whom we had sent to him. He then told us that our father Ahithophel had suddenly left Jerusalem, probably for his house in Giloh, when the Prince Absalom had disregarded his counsel for that of Hushai the Archite." "I have heard what that counsel was," replied David with some asperity. "Proceed with thy narrative." "He left behind him for Adin," continued Helem, "writ- ten advice, strongly urged, that he should abandon the cause of Prince Absalom, as it was worse than hopeless." After a silence of a few moments, the King resumed the conversation.  "Thy uncle Eliam is not with us, Helem. Dost know whether his absence is the result of intentional rebellion, or of mere accident?" "He was at Hebron, my lord the King, when we first reached there." "Dost believe he is an adherent of Absalom?" The King's tones faltered as-he pronounced his son's name. "I fear such is the case," sorrowfully replied Helem. "Sheva," said the King, turning to the scribe as he spoke, "if time proves Eliam to have played the traitor, strike his name from the list of my worthies. The man who can thus array himself against, not simply his King, but his daughter and her son Solomon, appointed by God as my successor,   THE KING IN MAHA NAIM.       113 deserves no honorable mention in the Chronicles of the nation." The King's words were promptly spoken. Then he pro- ceeded in gentler tones. "If I thus punish my enemies, I know also how to reward those who are faithful to me. Sheva, what companies of a hundred still remain without leaders?" "In Joab's division, my lord the King, the third, the fourth, the seventh-" "( That will suffice," interrupted the King. ".Write down the name of Benaiah, the son of Ahaziah, as captain of the third, and Helem, the son of Jonathan, as captain of the fourth, and notify Joab of these appointments." The young soldiers on whom this honor had been con- ferred by royal hands, gracefully and feelingly acknowledged I  it. The hour having arrived in which the King held a mili- tary council composed of his general officers and certain captains of thousands, he waved his hand in token of fare- well and left the apartment. Then arose the murmur of conversation, which had been suppressed in the presence of the King. Groups formed, salutations were exchanged, which the peculiar circum- stances of the times made more feeling and sincere. They were all exiles from their homes-not from choice, and with power of returning when they chose. Who could say whether they would ever again see those homes as they had been of old? Exciting, however, as were the events of the hour, there were present in that room some who, if not indifferent to them, were so absorbed in other affairs that they had little thought for aught else. What to Ethni were dynasties in the balance? His feel- ings were so keenly alive to his own purposes, his heart so rankled by disappointed love, that he heeded little the ris- ing or falling fortunes of King David and his son. Around Rebekah were rising events long buried, she had hoped for ever, which had commenced intruding them- selves upon her on that day when Rizpah had so suddenly appeared to her, and which had assumed an aspect still more terrible when her son had openly declared rebellion to her life-long wishes. The dread foreboding that these spectres (     "4         ATHALIAH. of the past might reveal themselves to others, shut out of her heart any present sorrow for distressed and possibly fallen royalty. Benaiah, loyal as he seemed, would rather now be in Gib- eon, acting as Miriam's protector, than wearing in the King's cause the newly-acquired honors conferred upon him; while in the depths of Helem's heart lurked a desire that he might be with Adin, fighting under the banners of so hand- some and gallant a Prince as Absalom. It chanced that these four met together at the door of the apartment, when about leaving it. Before, however, Helem and Ethni had exchanged salutations-cordial on the part of the former, while a cold constraint fettered the words of the latter-the group was joined by the woman who had re- garded with such intentness the varying scenes of the morn- ing. There was the same distant acknowledgment on Re- bekah's part, received and answered with an easy grace. Ethni, to avoid any possibility of an introduction to Benaiah, turned and greeted the new comer with marked attention. Still the same easy, graceful manner, with perhaps a little greater degree of cordiality. But follow that woman along the city streets to the re- tirement of her temporary home. Now, when no eye is upon her, mark the change that steals over those beautiful features. Ethni's smiles and tones had produced the change in her heart which now appears upon her face. She sits in deep revery, unconscious of present surroundings. In her eyes beams the soft and dreamy light reflected from the bright happiness of by-gone days. In the hushed room rises the murmur of a gentle sigh, and now drops glitter on the long, drooping eye-lashes. But this only for a moment! Those tears are scornfully dashed away, and there flashes forth a fire that dries up the moisture and leaves the eye hard and dry as jet. A laugh of derision at her own weak- ness jars the stillness, and through her set teeth she slowly articulates, "I shall yet be avenged, terribly avenged!" Thou mayst be poor slave of a long, inveteratehate! but beware, that, like Samson of old, in involving others in ruin, thou perishest not with them!   THE EVENING BEFORE THE BATTLE.     115 CHAPTER XIX. THE EVENING BEFORE THE BATTLE. "HELEM, didst hear that voice?" "Yes, and a very musical voice it was, too. But thou needst not start up so, for it wasn't Miriam's." Benaiah reseated himself as with some confusion he an- swered, "No, but it startled me." Yes, I think it did, as if thou hadst been stricken with a dart. But what thinkst thou of our new quarters?" "Much more comfortable than usually falls to the lot of soldiers," replied Benaiah. "Thou forgetest that we are something more than mere soldiers. Come, Benaiah, it is a half hour yet to sunset, let us give our new dignity an airing." "Helem, excuse me. I feel somewhat fatigued after our long ride to-day, and as this couch looks particularly luxu- rious, I think I will try it. Ah! it feels so," continued Be- naiah, as he sank in its soft cushions, "now, nothing less than the trumpet's call can arouse me." "Or that musical voice," retorted Helem, with good-natured malice. "But what a fool I am! I am the man to follow up these sweet voices. Here's for an adventure. I will see whether the face is as pretty as the voice is musical." "Helem, what thoughtlessness!" exclaimed Benaiah, half- raising himself up, for he had little doubt as to whom the voice belonged. "Remember we are in no conquered city, but in one whose inhabitants have shown great loyalty and kindness to the King." "What pretty woman, my good brother, ever objected so terribly at being looked at? for I know she must be pretty." "But, Helem, let events, at least, take their proper course. She is, evidently, a resident, with us, of this house, and thou mayst see her a score of times before we leave it." "Yes, closely veiled! Besides, we may be ordered to march to-morrow. Soldiers ought never to procrastinate." Helem, after giving utterance to this weighty maxim, cautiously advanced towards the hangings that separated the room they were in from the next apartment. Benaiah instantly rose up. In which lay the greater dan-     "6          ATHALIAH. ger? To let Helem proceed, or make him acquainted with the secret he had confided to his brother Reuben on the Hill of Olives? Before he could decide, Helem had parted the drapery, and looked into the next apartment. He turned his head towards Benaiah, who was still un- certain as to the course to pursue, and making a negative gesture, whispered, "Empty! But there is another room beyond from which I can catch the murmur of subdued voices." Benaiah approached the opening. His quick ear con- firmed the truth of Helem's words. His impulsive friend was about passing into the next room. Fearing that she whose anger there was so much cause to dread might ap- pear through the hangings opposite, he instantly decided on his course of action. He drew Helem back by main force. The drapery fell in its accustomed place. Helem regarded his friend with a look in which anger and enquiry were strangely commingled. "Helem, thou art treading on dangerous ground. The woman thou art so heedlessly seeking a glimpse of is the most powerful woman in Israel. Thou fearest Joab-dread her even more, if once thou shouldst arouse her anger." There was an earnestness in Benaiah's tones that carried immediate conviction to Helem's mind. Of course he could not stop here, but was obliged to tell Helem all that had oc- curred when he went to Joab's tent to ask that he might be bearer of tidings to the King. "Thou hast never seen her face, then?" enquired Helem, with an interest so intense that Benaiah augured little com- fort from its probable results. "No." "Nor heard her voice again until to-night?" "No.' "And hast no idea who she is?" "Not the least." C"Strange! who can she be?" Benaiah begged his friend, as he valued his own safety, to forget the whole matter, or think of it only as something that might bring trouble to him. Poor argument to use to a person of Helem's disposition. Danger lent the pursuit an additional charm in his eyes. So all that Benaiah could gain from him was a promise to   THE EVENING BEFORE THE BATTLE.     117 be circunmspect. Lean comfort this! Helem hardly knew the meaning of the word. Just then a heavy step was heard approaching the room. A soldier entered. He brought an order to Benaiah to join his company, which had been detailed to carry into effect some decision of the military council held that afternoon, Hastily equipping himself in full armor, and forgetting all the fears he had just experienced, he bade Helem a soldier's farewell, and left the room. Helem, half envying what he considered the good fortune of Benaiah, in being so soon called to active service, threw himself down on the couch his friend had found so comfort- able. The day had been one of fatigue to him, and he soon fell asleep. From a chaos of troubled dreams he at length awoke to reality. The room was shrouded in darkness, and for a moment he could not recall where he was. In the extremity of the apartment towards which his eyes were turned, he observed a faint glimmer of reddish light. "It must be from the lamp in the next room, shining through the red tapestry," was his thought. He noticed, too, that a faint perfume was in the air. Was it this that produced the lan- guor he felt, of was this only another dream? How still it was! He hears now a light step, then a low murmur of voices, and then the name "Benaiah!" clearly pronounced, in tones of surprise. tHelem raises his head from the soft cushions of the couch on which he is reclining. He can now hear more dis- tinctly. "How didst thou learn this?" This was the voice whose tones had so startled Benaiah. "I saw him leave the house." "But Caleb told me that two entered." "I do not know who the other is." "Probably Helem. They came together to the King to- day. Hark! that is Joab's step! Leave me!" The faint sound of retreating footsteps told Helem one of the speakers had left the apartment. The sound of a heavier tread ushers the approach of Joab. "My lord Joab has been long absent." The words were softly uttered, but in tones so pure and clear that Helem could distinctly hear them.     "8         ATHALIAHI "These are stirring times,--"Helem could not catch the name. "Stern necessity has kept me from thee." "And when will this affair be over?" "If a single battle ends it, very soon. A scouting party has been sent out to-night. There have been indications of the breaking up of Absalom's camp. As soon as his army advances we will go to meet it." Who leads this scouting party?" "Why so curious about military affairs, my--" the term of endearment was lost to Helem's ears. "Thou forgetest that thou hast made me half soldier, and that, in following the fortunes of the King, I am become almost wholly one." "I cannot recall the officer's name, but the company sent out is the third of Izhai's thousand." "I was right, then. Benaiah leads the party. I was present when the King made him captain of the third com- pany." "It seems to me thou takest a great interest in this young man." "I do, "was the unmoved reply. A brief pause. "I am surprised that my lord Joab should allow any feelings of jealousy to disturb him. Who in all this realm so worthy the love of a proud woman as thou?" Another pause. "But when wilt thou give me proof of thy love-"The tones were low, and Helem could scarcely distinguish the words. "Have not I given it already, my dear lord? Think what risk I have run of compromising my honor by going to meet thee in the tented field!" "But why run any risk? Be mine and thou shalt out- rival the Queen in power." "Thou knowest I have a vow to fulfil. When that is ac- complished, ask what thou wilt." "But when will this be?" "Soon, I hope. Every request I make of thee is only in furtherance of it." "Thou hast never hinted to me the nature of this vow. What is it?" "Suppose I should answer, a case of blood-revenge?"   THE EVENING BEFORE THE BATTLE.    119 "Then, I would say, slay the murderer," was the prompt reply. "But if he were in sanctuary?" "Lure him from it." "Thou wouldst, then, link craft with vengeance?" "Yes, I would make craft the servant of revenge." "Suppose, again, that the injury done me was worse than death?" "Still death. I know no greater punishment." "I do." A silvery laugh accompanied these words, but it made Helem shudder. After a little pause. "My projects are ripening fast. Let them bask in the sunshine of thy favor a little longer, and this hand will soon be thine. My heart is already in thy keeping." And thou dost not love this Benaiah, then?" "Love him! I hate him," was the reply, in such vehe- ment tones that Helem chilled at the sound. "And yet thou once favored him?" "That I might prepare for him a fate worse than death." "We may not meet again till after the battle. I think it will take place to-morrow." "Farewell, then, my dear lord. Victory is sure to be ours." The lessening sounds of Joab's footstep told Helem that the sweet-voiced woman was alone, who had proclaimed such hatred for his friend Benaiah. He must know, at what- ever personal risk, this avowed enemy of his friend. He, therefore, with bated breath and stealthy tread, approached the intervening hangings, and making a small aperture, peered into the room from which the sounds had proceeded. On a pile of silken cushions, with a softened light falling on her from a lamp suspended to the ceiling, sat a woman, dressed with a richness and taste that displayed the outlines of her exquisite form to the best advantage.' Her finely shaped head, crowned with its wealth of glossy tresses, its only ornament, save a few orient pearls that gleamed out of dark recesses, was bowed upon her bosom. Eager as Helem was to solve the mystery, he could not fail to notice and admire the beauty-the hushed repose of the scene that met his eyes.     120         ATHALIAHT When that regal head was raised, would he recognize the features, or would they be strange to him? He thought he would, for something in the dress, or attitude, or form, he scarce knew which, if not familiar to him, at least he fan- cied he had seen before. Soon all doubts were solved. The head was slowly raised. Helem started back amazed. The beautiful face turned fully towards him, was that of the cousin of Re- bekah, Athaliah I CHAPTER XX. THE BATTLE. "ONG mused Helem over the strange revelation that had occurred to him. He run over in his mind all that he had ever heard or knew of Athaliah, and could not glean a sin- gle fact that would indicate her as possessing the character -she had evinced that evening. Could it be it was only a character assumed to mislead Joab. But what could be her motive in this? No, it must be as she said, and her hatred of Benaiah was a dread reality. What ought he to do? Acquaint his friend with the real facts, and perhaps embit- ter his life with forebodings that might never be realized, or leave him in blissful ignorance, while he would watch the motions of his enemy. But how do this? It would proba- bly never occur again that he could hear Athaliah discuss her plans. Helem at length got bewildered, and wisely concluded to get a little sleep, to fit him for the stirring duties of the next day. The stars had not all been put out, when he was aroused from his slumbers by the shrill blast of a trumpet, that seemed to awaken echoes in all parts of the city. Putting on his armor with all the celerity possible, he -hastened into the street. It was full of armed men hurrying in opposite directions. All was- bustle, and confusion. Companies were rapidly getting together, and soon all would be order and regularity.   THE BATTLE.         121 Helem found nearly all his company at their place of meet- ing ; and some time before the order came for them to join the main division, they were all in rank. He rapidly passed from man to man, examining the weapons, and was delighted to find his company was mostly composed of tried veterans in the service. The scouting party returned near morning with intelli- gence that Absalom had broken up his encampment, and was preparing to march towards Mahanaim. David's army was divided into three divisions, under the command respectively of Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. This ar- rangement of his force had been made when David himself had intended to have taken the general supervision of the whole. But it had been decided that David ran too much risk in going into the battle. It was a contest dependent upon the life of one man on either side. Had Absalom's advisers shown the same wisdom as David's, or Absalom the same good judgment in yielding to such advice, if given, this contest would not have been thus speedily terminated. The whole army had been gathered within the walls, and as they passed out of the Main Gate of the city, David re- viewed them. This Main Gate was double, consisting of an inner and outer gate, surmounted by a tower. The entrance leading up to this tower was on the side between the two gates. There David sat. How he, at the last moment, sank the general into the father! Instead of speaking words of encouragement to the soldiers, and endeavoring to inspire them with a noble courage, by reminding them that they were about to fight for the anointed of the Lord of Hosts, all his thoughts seemed only to have one object-"My son, my son!" As each division came up, it was the same anxiety still: "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with -Absalom."  And officer passed this command to officer, and officer to men, till the whole army knew that David had commanded that Absalom's person should be, regarded as sacred. Melancholy weakness of a King! He forgot he was father to a nation. He forgot, or seemed to do so, that this very son was even now putting in deadly peril thousands of his subjects. David's army went forth confident of success. They had     122         ATHALIAH. conquered so often before, together, under the same great leader, that victory seemed to them a matter of course. They knew that the army of Absalom greatly outnumbered theirs, but they also knew the field where the shock of i battle was to take place would not admit of a greater num- i ber being opposed to them, than they could more than match. Thus fearless and unfaltering they went forth. The sun-  light glistened on the bright armor of these mailed men, and pennon and banner and standard waved proudly in the air. From two helmets floated a rich piece of silk. They  were officers, and many wondered at their wearing the same colors, and thought, perchance, they might be rivals for the  same fair one's love.  Alas I this beauty and regularity cannot last long. That ; bright armor will be battered and blood-stained, and ban-  ner and standard dust-soiled and torn, and many a man X who treads so gallantly and proudly will be borne from the battle-field dying or dead. Each man knew that this must be the termination of every battle, whether lost or won, but each one thought himself invincible. David's army awaited the approach of Absalom's forces in a field partially skirted on the side from which Absalom was approaching, by the wood of Ephraim-so named from the fierce slaughter of the Ephraimites in this very wood by Jepththa. On they came. No whit less gallant in bear- ing than David's army. From their trumpets came forth a shrill blast of defiance, echoed back with undiminished ardor by the opposing force. The division of Joab, wholly composed of men whose skill and valor had been a hundred times tested, was held in reserve. Joab, surrounded by his officers, beheld the con- flict from a gentle eminence. The remaining divisions of Abishai and Ittai fiercely engaged the enemy. The result was by no means certain. If the adherents of Absalom were not actuated by the same noble ardor as Da- vid's, they possessed the dauntless desperation of men who, if they could not conquer, felt it would be better to die. They had risked everything. Even if David gave them back the poor gift of a life justly forfeited, yet on that life would rest the stain of disloyalty and rebellion. Had the position of the battle-field been as favorable to Absalom as it was to David, or even equally so, humanly   THE BATTLE.         123 speaking, David would have lost the day, and losing the day, his crown, if not his life would have gone with it. Long and equally waged the conflict. Joab intently watched for the least advantage on his side to hurl his divi- sion into the conflict. The moment came. Absalom's troops began losing ground. Now was the eventful moment. The reserved division, who had been panting and chafed for the fray, rushed to the conflict. Helem, as he led forth his company, had only one thought, to acquit himself to the utmost of his ability. He felt he possessed a giant's strength, and the determination of a score of giants. Benaiah, before he became all soldier, gave one earnest thought to Miriam, breathed a fervid though hurried prayer that if he fell God would protect her. Soon he was engaged hand to hand in the fierce conflict. There was the loud crashing of steel on steel, shouting of battle cries, shrill blasts of the trumpets, the groans and shrieks of the fallen. Just at the critical moment when victory seemed equally poised, Benaiah caught a glimpse of a falling soldier whose helmet was decorated as his own. This man had been contending with two opponents. As he fell beneath a blow he had no opportunity of parrying, his helmet became loosened, and Benaiah saw his brother's face. Reuben looked his last farewell, for death to him was now certain. To Benaiah it seemed a look of supplication. On the impulse of the moment he rushed forward and struck one of the assailants to the ground. This diversion enabled Reuben to recover his feet, when he immediately disap- peared. The excitement of the scene gave no opportunity to Be- naiah to reflect what might be the consequences of this af- fair to him. Soon after, Absalom's forces were in full flight. His superior numbers now only proved a disadvantage, and increased the confusion and difficulty of the retreat. Great numbers attempted to escape through the wood of Ephraim, and here was where the troops of Absalom suffered the greatest slaughter. Absalom was among these fugitives, mounted on a snow-white mule, a token of kingly rank. David's soldiers had abundant opportunity of either slay- ing or capturing him, but they too well recollected the only command the King had given, to venture on it. Though the battle was won, the contest, if Absalom     124         ATHALIAH. should survive, was only just begun. The foolish weakness ! of David in commanding his soldiers to spare Absalom's life, threatened to thoroughly drench the land in its length ! and breadth with the nation's blood. God now interferes. Absalom's mule becomes unmanageable to its rider that it might be manageableto him who makes the wrath of man to praise him. The mule runs under the gnarled boughs of an oak. A branch, which had grown into its peculiar shape for this very purpose, caught the head of Absalom and firmly held it. The mnule kept on its course and left j him hanging. Encumbered by his armor, he could not ex- tricate himself.  What a sorry position for a man whose great genius, misdirected though it was, had turned the hearts of almost  an entire nation from allegiance to their rightful King I He who had but a little while since hundreds of thousands at : his call and command, now hanging helpless as an infant K in the close embrace of an oak tree.           Protected around his neck by the gorget of his helmet, his physical pain could not have been so great as to preclude reflection as to the state he was in. Bitterer than the death that followed, must have been those reflections. To have succeeded so famously! to be baulked at last by so slight an accident! Joab approaches. Absalom's doom is sealed. The mule has done his part, the oak his; Joab will not fail to do his. Speedily and without faltering he applies the remedy that hushes the bloody strife of civil war. No more need of car- nage now. The trumpet of recall is blown. The pursuit is checked, and the lives of thousands, the happiness of thousands of homes, is purchased with this one death. This act, bloody though it was, was a deed of patriotism that atoned for much of the violence of Joab's life. It was a deed, too, that threatened no common danger to its per- petrator. True, at this time, Joab was never so powerful. He was the very soul of the military power, and that power was everything now. But though the King might not have the power to punish, he would recollect. He. did so, and clutched at Joab's life even when his hand was mouldering in the grave. Those who would sit in judgment upon the life of this great commander, must take into consideration the circum-   THE BATTLE.         125 stances of the age in which he lived. So thoroughly did the idea of blood-revenge possess the world's mind, that God, under certain wise restrictions, allowed its use. Cities of refuge were appointed in various parts of the country, with commodious highways running towards them. Here the man-slayer was safe from the blood-avenger till his cause could be adjudged. Now, one of the great blots on Joab's life was his assas- sination of Abner. Abner had slain Joab's brother Asahel. True, it was in battle and perfectly justifiable ; and if he had taken sanctuary in a city of refuge, the judges would not have delivered him up. But mark Joab's deferene to the law in this case. He did not slay Abner within the walls of Hebron, for that was a city of refuge. He took him aside in the gate. There are some who attribute to Joab in this matter a motive of ambition-a fear that Abner might overtop him in the King's favor. But Joab was ever faithful to David. It is the highest characteristic of his life. If he had other motive than to avenge his brother, why not call it fidelity to his King and country. Abner had but lately been the King's enemy, and now comes to propose a treacherous sur- render of his late master's interests to David; not out of love to David, but from anger to Ishbosheth, who had ac- cused him of a sin, which he must have had good grounds for doing, for Ishbosheth feared Abner. For Joab's murder of 'Amasa there is less justification. True, he too had fought against the King, but assassination ought never to be the deed of a brave man. The bearing of good news is ever a grateful task. Ahi- maaz, the son of Zadok, who had performed the King such good service-a service, as it proved, of no little danger, and who, it seems, had been engaged in this battle-applied to Joab for the favor of carrying the news of the victory. Joab, knowing that the King would be anxious only about Absalom, kindly refused permission, but ordered Cushi, whom he knew had witnessed the death of Absalom, and was the King's messenger, to go and tell the King what he had seen. Cushi instantly departed. Ahimaaz still thinking the news could only be good, as he was ignorant of Absalom's death, persisted in his request. Joab, thinking that Cushi,     from the start he had, would reach the King first, finally gave assent to the request of Ahimaaz. Ahimaaz started off, and by taking a more direct way, reached the King first. The King sat between the two gates in the entrance leading up to the tower, so that the watch- man on its top could communicate the result of his observa- tions to him. He announces that a man running alone is approaching the city. One man! then it is not a retreat. He is a bearer of tidings. Ahimaaz appears near enough to be recognized. The King calls him a good man, and augurs that he brings good tidings. Ahimaaz thinks naturally enough he does. But in reply to his news of victory, to which the King scarce gives heed, comes the enquiry, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz's ardor suddenly cools. He replies, that when Joab sent the King's messenger, who was now approaching, and himself, he saw a tumult, but knew not what it was. No more need of Ahimaaz! He may stand aside. He can tell all about the victory. But what of that! Ab- salom! Absalom! Absalom is everything to the King. Cushi arrives. "Tidings, my lord the King! The Lord has avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee." This matters not. Still the same enquiry, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" "And Cushi answered: "The enemies of my lord the King, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is." And the King was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went thus he said, "Oh! my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would to God I had died for thee, Oh! Absalom, my son, my son." CHAPTER XXI. JOAB'S COUNSEL TO THE KING. A GREAT victory had been won, and with jubilant spirits David's array returned to Mahanaim. They had left behind   JOAB' COUNSEL TO THE KING.     127 them the battle-field covered with the dead. But they were the vanquishers, and therefore they rejoiced. But why this sudden cessation of glad spirits as the sol- diers enter the gate of the city? Why does their proud bearing change into the stealthy tread of men who would rather hasten out of sight unobserved? Why? the King- the luminary of the nation, whose smile gladdened a nation's hearts, whose frown awed a nation into silence-was not here to meet them. He had sought the first place of retire- ment he could find to weep and lament for his dead son Absalom. It was not long before there were mutterings in the army that betokened a coming storm. This son for whom the King was neglecting them that he might mourn for him, had been the cause of their perilling their lives, and not simply that, but had arrayed them against their own countrymen. No one who loved his King and country, but that would rejoice that Absalom was dead. If David would not forget that he was a father, he ought also not to forget that hoe was a King. What an opportunity this for Joab to seize the crown himself! With a fidelity to the King which he made pro- verbial, he goes to him, not like a cringing courtier, but a fearless, plain-spoken friend. He tells him of the state of the army's mind, and presents to him a forcible and graphic picture of his conduct. These men thou neglectst to see, have this day, by their courage and devotion, saved thy life, the- lives of thy sons, among whom is Solomon, the heir of thy throne--the lives of thy wives, thy daughters, and thy concubines. And is Absalom, who was thy deadliest enemy, more than these? Thou hast disregarded alike officers and soldiers, and declared by thy immoderate grief, that if all we had died this day, and Absalom had lived, it had pleased thee well. David undoubtedly erred in this. But there is one pal- liation in his favor. It was not simply the death of Absa- lom that so moved his heart. It was the awful load of un- repented sins that Absalom bore on his head into the pres- ence of his Maker. David profited by Joab's timely warning, to show him- self to the people, and all murmurings and discontent quickly disappeared. t,     The master spirit of the rebellion having passed away, the rebellion itself vanished. The men of Israel who had i so lately rebelled, now bethought them of King David's valor in subduing their enemies, and of the prosperity he had brought to the kingdom. They determined to return to their allegiance and recall the King. The King, instead of immediately complying with their request, sent messengers to Zadok and Abiathar to speak to the elders of Judah, who had either joined with Absa- lom, or else remained passive spectators in Jerusalem, of the contest, urging them to recall the King. For he was of their tribe. Should other tribes take the lead?    He also commissioned Zadok to offer to Amasa the rank  of " captain of the host," as he intended to depose Joab I from the post. This was to be Joab's reward for the truly patriotic deed he performed in the wood of Ephraim, in crushing the rebellion in the person of Absalom.    I Priestly influence prevailed. Judah returned to its alle- I giance as one man, and sent to recall the King and all who had gone with him. But leaving, for a time, the great stream of events, let us turn to some of the personages in our story. Benaiah's reflections, when he had time to reflect, were of a most fearful description. He saw in its true colors the enormity of the act he had committed, in a closely contested action, when almost the valor of one man might turn the scale, in actually taking part with the enemy. He had done it on impulse. Reflection would have told him he must stand by and see his brother smitten to death, if he would do his duty to his King. It was one consequence of the many ad- ditional horrors of civil war. He knew there was but one punishment-death. Even had he been a friend of Joab, it was questionable whether Joab would interfere to save him. But as the case stood, i there was no doubt as to what the end must be. One faint hope sustained him. In the confusion of battle, the act might not have been noticed. Reuben's assailants might have mistaken him for one of Absalom's soldiers. Ah! Benaiah, if thou hadst known that the keen, pierc- ing eyes of jealousy, hate, and revenge had been fastened upon thee, thou wouldst not have had even this little hope. On the day of battle, Ethni had carried Joab's orders to his    X 1.J  iJ X J LL OU V .aiVU . .L. V division to advance, detailing the manner in which the ad- vance was to be made. As he approached the troops, his quick eye caught sightof something that sent a keen pang of jealousy to his heart. It was a piece of rich silk, floating from the crest of an officer's helmet. He recognized it as part of a scarf he had given Miriam. The pattern was pe- culiar, and he had no doubt as to its identity, and as little as to whom the soldier was who bore it. If there had been the slightest doubt, it would have vanished, for Ethni saw Benaiah's face as he passed his company. During the engagement, Ethni strained his eyes to keep track of that fluttering silk. Not that he wished to see it. soiled in the gore and dust of the battle-field. No, he wanted no one else to take the vengeance he thought be- longed solely to him, and besides, Benaiah would then die a proud and honorable death. But there was a fascination in thus watching it, he cared neither to account for, nor re- sist. Often he would lose it for some time. Suddenly it would appear where he least expected it. Finally, his duty as Joab's order bearer carried him nearer the strife. Now he was quite near, and could see the brave and gallant deeds of its wearer. Rival though he was, he could not refrain a feeling of admiration for Benaiah's bravery and skill. Sud- denly occurred the scene of Reuben's rescue. Ethni, with eyes strained to take in every particular, noted with avidity this occasion of a terrible revenge. Benaiah shall not only die, but die a dishonored and disgraceful death. Carefully treasuring up everything that could lead to a full detection, he returned to Joab. CHAPTER XXII. THE MYSTERY SOLVED. ON the evening of the battle, after Helem and Benaiah had performed the duties of their position-such as report- ing the number and names of the men they had lost, and seeing that the wounded were properly cared for, returned 6*     130         ATHALIAH.  at a late, or rather early, hour, for it was past midnight, to  their place of lodgment.  Helem was in high spirits; Benaiah naturally depressed. "Come, cheer up, my good brother! We have won a  glorious victory! Why so sad? The dead may be enjoy-  ing themselves more than we perhaps. Our turn will come, and then I want no one to wear a long face for me."   i "I was thinking of the living." "Ah! of Miriam-darling sister. How I love her for winning me back to loyalty. Dost know I should have felt ashamed if I had been fighting on the other side to-day?  But why sad, thinking of Miriam?" "Helem, thou wilt laugh at me when I tell thee it was of myself I was thinking." "Yes, so I will," and Helem's merry laugh rang through the room; "at the very idea of that making thee sad. Thee! one of the handsomest and bravest captains in the army; and to praise thee more than this-the man every way worthy of my dear sister's love."  "Dear Miriam!" and Benaiah sighed. Helem looked confounded. "Art playing a part to amuse me, Benaiah?" "Helem, I am sorry to cast a cloud over thy gay spirits, but I am in a sea of troubles." Helem's manner instantly changed. Reaching out his hand, he said, "I am with thee then! Let us fight our way out or perish together." Benaiah affectionately grasped the hand held out, and then related the particulars connected with his brother's rescue. "I see no cause of alarm in this. In the confusion and excitement of the moment, probably Reuben is the only one that knows of this in its true light. His assailants might easily have mistaken thee for one of Absalom's officers." "Yes, but Helem, suppose it should be discovered! My doom would be certain." "Even then the King might be induced to pardon thee." "He might if he had the power, but in a case like this Joab would be the real King." "But then, Benaiahi is it wise thus to brood over an evil that may never occur? Think no more of it. When the trouble comes, trust-me; we will find a way to overcome it." "o,i    THE MYSTERY SOLVED.       131 The friends then sought repose, and never was repose more welcomed. Benaiah, who had not slept for thirty-six hours, was soon in oblivion, undisturbed even by dreams. Helem lay awake for some little time. He feared greatly for his friend, though he had assumed the contrary. He knew Be- naiah had a fearful enemy to contend with. Could she by any means hear of this, his friend's career would find speedy termination. Suppose she had overheard them! The very thought alarmed him, though he knew this could not be the case, as they had conversed about the matter in very low tones. Gradually Helem's revery glided into dreams. A few hours before the friends had thus been conversing to- gether, under this same roof two others were discussing the same subject with widely different objects. After his duties left him the leisure, Ethni set about contriving how he could gain an interview with the woman he had so much reason to regard as the most fitting ally to turn the incident he had witnessed to the best account. He naturally directed his steps towards the house he had seen Rizpah enter the day previous. He had a vague hope that something would occur to fulfil his desire. There was no moon, and Ethni, after reaching the house, stood for some time quite near its entrance. Once or twice he thought he would let matters rest till morning, but then he feared any delay might retard the object he had in view. At length the door opens, but it is a man that looks out. His head is uncovered. He seems to have no other object but star gazing. Ethni gets a fair view of him, for there is a light behind him. Can he be so much mistaken? Is not that Caleb, the serving man of his mother's cousin Athaliah? He leaves his post of observation. When opposite the door he stops. "Is it thou, Caleb?" Caleb, before answering in the affirmative, bent forward to see who it was that addressed him. Ethni had now decided on his plan of action. "Is this my cousin Athaliah's abode?" "Yes, my lord Ethni." "Ascertain if I can see her at so late an hour." Ethni waited in a small room opening on the vestibule of the house for Caleb's return. The answer was favorable to his wishes. Athaliah would be happy to receive him.     132         ' ATHALIAH. He was conducted to the apartment in which the conver- sation between Athaliah and Joab had taken place the pre- vious evening, and which had been heard by Helem. Little did the latter imagine, when striving to cheer his friend, that such a sequel as was now to transpire had been added to the painful secret he already carried in his heart. Ethni was not a little surprised at the gracious reception his mother's cousin extended to him. She had never before appeared so beautiful and fascinating. The scene, so full of quiet and elegant repose, contrasting so forcibly with the one he had that day passed through, added its effect to the influence she could not fail to obtain over him. In a few words, replete with kindness, she congratulated him on his recent preferment and his escape from danger in his first battle. Then with a smile that added new radiance to her features, she thanked him for calling upon her on the evening of such a fatiguing day. Ethni, slightly confused, replied that he had seen Caleb at the door as he was passing the house, and had then become aware for the first time that this was her place of lodgment. "Ah! then I am indebted to accident for this visit!" "In this instance, yes; but I should have ascertained the place of thy abode if chance had not so happily revealed it to me." "But methinks, Ethni, thou wert not so desirous of seeing me in Jerusalem."  The playful tones in which these words were uttered saved Ethni the confusion he otherwise might have shown as he replied, "Exile makes even strangers friends." "Why ever strangers, cousin, when we are so near of kin? I spare thee an answer to my question. Let it suffice that we are friends now---" "' And always," added Ethni, taking the hand that was extended towards him; but scarcely had his own clasped it when with sudden surprise he relinquished it. He had seen on Athaliah's finger, Rizpah's ring. , Athaliah, unmoved at this apparent rudeness, did not  i wait for any poor explanation Ethni might make, but said frankly, "Thou art surprised at seeing a ring which thou hast thought the property of another in my possession."   THE MYSTERY SOLVED.        133 "Yes, my mother has one, its exact likeness," was the guarded reply. "Readily answered!" replied Athaliah, smiling; "but that was not what caused thy surprise. One moment, Eth- ni! I will not ask thy confidence until I summon one who will tell thee thou canst give it me safely." Athaliah reached toward a small table standing near her, and struck a bell standing on it, in what appeared to Ethni a peculiar manner. Scarcely had its clear tones ceased to vibrate when Rizpah entered the room. She stood at a respectful distance with her hands crossed on her breast, waiting further orders. Athaliah addressed her. "Rizpah, tell Ethni, the son of my cousin Rebekah, by whose direction it was thou heldst n interview with him at thy house!" "Thine," was the brief answer, accompanied by an in- clination of the head. "By whose influence was it that he received the appoint- ment on Joab's staff he now holds?" "Thine." "He may confide in me, then, as he would have done in thee?" "Certainly, for I have only acted as thy agent." "That will suffice." The Arab woman, with a low reverence, quietly withdrew. For a few moments nothing was said on either side. Ethni's thoughts were too rapid for utterance, and Athaliah was content to wait the effects this new development would produce. Much of the mystery that had enveloped the strange events that had occurred to him was now cleared away. Some remained, but it would be easy to dispel that, as he had been brought in-contact with the master-spirit of the movement. When he saw the submission and humility of Rizpah to his cousin, he felt half angered with himself for having ever regarded the Arab woman with feelings akin to awe. He noticed that Athaliah only referred to the last inter- view he had held with Rizpah. Was she cognizant of the first, and an instigator of the pain inflicted on his mother? Rizpah had her ring at that time as if acting by her au-     134         ATIALIAH.  thority. He resolved to take some fitting opportunity for ascertaining this, and if his suspicions were well founded,  of insisting upon an explanation from her.  Then he asked himself why this charming woman, who seemed to have such influence with Joab, and who had ser-  vants who decked their homes with kingly splendor, shoud i so interest herself in his purposes. Rapid and intermingling as was the current of his thoughts, one idea was uppermost; that notwithstanding Rizpah's submissive humility to Athaliah, he believed she must have separate designs of her own, with no little power at her disposal for their accomplishment; and he decided to be on his guard as to informing Athaliah of what passed  between them, should she chance to question him. Athaliah was the first to break silence. She had watched the varying expressions of Ethni's features, and was not al- together satisfied with them. "Have I been mistaken, then, Ethni, in supposing that thou wouldst prefer acting with the serving woman rather than the mistress?" "Certainly not, my cousin, but I am surprised that thou shouldst ever have made use of her. Why not have prof- fered me thy kind assistance directly?" "Easily answered! The manner in which I proposed to help thee, required firm purpose on thy part. I was not will- ing to appear as thy friend until thou hadst shown this. Thy mother had taught thee to avoid me. What folly in me it would have been, then, to advise thee to run counter to all her wishes. Thou hast shown a man's strength of will, Ethni; now I can trust thee." There was truth enough in this piece of flattery to make it palatable, and the question that was forming in his mind as to Athaliah's real motives in aiding him, was answered in a way she would have preferred had she known what was passing in his mind. "Rizpah has told thee that my purpose is to thwart Be- naiah-nay, to crush him, as well as to gain Miriam's love?" "Ah! Ethni, little need for Rizpah to tell me that. Re- collect it is she who has learned of me all that relates to thy affairs. I will be frank with thee and say, that apart from my desire to aid thee, I have a personal motive-I too would be avenged on Benaiah,    THE MYSTERY SOLVED.       135 "Has he wronged thee, then?" I can say no more than I have said. In his downfall we have a common interest." "Then I can assure thee," exclaimed Ethni, excitedly, 4( that I have intelligence which will work his speedy ruin. It was to see Rizpah, whom I supposed the one best fitted to advise me, that I came here this night." "Thou knowest, then, that she made this house her tem- porary place of sojourn?" Only from seeing her enter it yesterday. But listen while I relate circumstances that, if known and proved as they should and can be, will bring upon Benaiah a certain and disgraceful doom." Athaliah, though she had talked of a common interest, had no idea of admitting Ethni into her plans as an equal co-worker. She designed him only as a mere instrument in the working out of her objects. She felt he was treating her with less deference than he had evinced towards Rizpah, who had had the advantage that mystery gave her. These reflections, however, did not disturb her. She knew she had the power to change all this at will, and she quietly resolved to fix at once the relations they were henceforth to hold to one another. While Ethni related in all its details the strange scene he had witnessed on the battle-field that day, though Atha- liah could not but acknowledge to herself its importance in the furtherance of her plans, yet she showed no wonderment, but listened indifferently as if it were something in which she had no concern. Ethni was not only very much surprised, but half angered at the coolness with which Athaliah received his words. He had anticipated for them a very different reception. Her answer was even more chilling than her manner. "It would never do to hinge all our projects of revenge on this simple incident. It may have its use at some future time; but at present it would be folly to use it." "But what could more thoroughly crush Benaiah than this?" exclaimed Ethni. "Leave that to me. I have resources which thou knowest not." The calm tones of this reply were in strong contrast to the heated words of Ethni. A     100          ATHALIAH. "No! Joab must know of this at once!" "Then," replied Athaliah, in tones which, though still calm, were clear and decided, " our compact ceases. Go thy ways, hot-headed youth! Tell Joab what thou wilt, but beware lest thou rushest to thy own destruction, instead of securing Benaiah's. Go!" and Athaliah rose from her seat and ex- tended her arm imperiously towards the door, " this our first conference is our last. Leave me!" Ethni moved not. His eyes were fixed on the queenly form of Athaliah, drawn up to her full height, fascinating even in her anger.- It was not so much the conviction of the i power her influence over Joab gave her, that overawed him, as the majestic beauty that seemed radiating from her. But a moment before he had all but defied her, now he was ready to supplicate her on his knees. "Stay! Forgive me, I was too hasty!" he at length ex- claimed, starting up. "Nay, go to Joab or where else thou wilt. I have no need of thee!" She turned proudly from him. Ethni in an instant was at her feet, and in tones broken with his earnestness ex- claimed, "Athaliah! I will be thy slave, only do not dis- miss me thus!" She looked down upon his imploring features. The lamp suspended from the ceiling threw its soft light upon his up- turned face. Why does the cold and haughty expression of Athaliah melt into a look of tenderness and love, and her hand fall nerveless by her side? Does Ethni interpret her emotion aright as he seizes that hand and presses it to his burning lips? No! for on his bowed head now flashes a look of hate so intense that, could looks kill, it would lay him lifeless at her feet. But of this Ethni has not the slightest suspicion; for when he again raises his eyes, he sees on Athaliah's, not indeed the expression that had so fired his impulsive na- ture, but a sweet smile that told of forgiveness and recon- ciliation. Gentle as were the tones in which she bid him rise, easy and affable as was her after manner, Ethni did not venture to touch upon the topic they had been discussing. The harmony was too complete to risk what might again prove   THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM.      137 a discordant note. Athaliah, with charming grace, led the conversation to themes specially interesting to him, and he soon forgot all thoughts of vengeance in the pleasant emo- r tions of the swiftly passing hour. Just before he left her, she said, "This day's battle, re- sulting as it did, not simply in the defeat of Absalom's forces, but in his death, will prove decisive. We will soon return to Jerusalem. For the present let Benaiah repose in his fancied security, and enjoy his seeming triumph. Trust to me to strike when the blow will fall heaviest." Ethni readily assented, and pressing the fair hand pre- sented to him with more than a kinsman's fervor, he left the apartment. Again that expression of dreamy love steals over Atha- liah's face. It comes unbidden, like some sweet memory of the past. It lingers like an angel of mercy, seeking a resting place in the heart. Suddenly it flies, affrighted, for it seems to be twin-born with an antagonistic feeling of hate that follows it closely and hunts it down. "Shall I waver now," is the unuttered thought of Atha- liah, "when I have pursued for so many years the object of my revenge? And yet that look in his eyes is so like to his-but what foolish weakness is this? Not only thou, but thine, be the compass of my hate!" CHAPTER XXIIL THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM. ALL the necessary arrangements having been made, King David left- Mahanaim with his army, and those who had fled with him from Jerusalem, to meet the men of Judah at the river Jordan. Before reaching the place of meeting, Barzillai, who had sustained the King while he lay at Mahanaim, came to bid him farewell. He was a very rich man. David, sensible of the great benefit he had re- ceived from him, proposed that Barzillai should take up his abode in Jerusalem.     138         ATHALIAH. Beautiful was this interview between old age and royalty. Both of them might have been called kings, for each wore a crown: David a golden circlet, Barzillai the crown of honorable gray hairs. Nor were the deeds of the latter less kingly. He had succored one from whom he could scarce expect anything in return. And the mere value of the articles supplied was not the full test of his good-will to the distressed King. He had run a great risk in making the offering, in case Absalom had proved successful. He was, therefore, not simply generous, but heroic. And again, the circumstances-that surrounded Barzillai's life were even more than kingly. He had greatly benefited a King; that King, powerful as he was, had no power to re- turn the benefit conferred. What was the pomp of a court to a man whose declining years were filled with the sunny memories of a well-spent life! He needed no dazzle, and glare, and excitement to bury the past and silence the forebodings of the future. To him the past and future lent happiness to the present. Peacefully he would wear his crown to the last. No hand could pluck it from him-not even the hand of death. .What more than kingly independence of the things men rank as the highest good! How simple and beautiful the only request Barzillai has to make of the King!"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and my mother." Was this all? Nothing more than this to ask of a King who was anxious to lavish royal honors on him? Yes, one thing more. Beside Barzillai stood his son Chimham. Doubtless he was surprised, perhaps grieved, that his father should decline what to him appeared the very climax of earthly good. Barzillai's old age was kingly, not selfish. Much as he would have liked to have had that son with him during the few years he had yet to live, he would deny himself this pleasure to gratify his son by asking the King that he might remain with him. And was not this request only a disguised gift to the King? If in life's ruby current mingles the qualities of our fathers, it most certainly was a kingly gift. But we must pass on to incidents of a far different charac- ter. Shimei, the curser of exiled royalty, now appears as a   THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM.      139 suppliant for reinstated droyalty's pardon. How violent the transition from Barzillai to Shimei! How striking the contrast in the characters and action of the two men! As a curser he stood alone, and vile and wicked as his act was, we cannot withhold something like admiration for his bravery. If he had now appeared as then, and trusted simply to the King's generosity for pardon, then there would have been something here worthy of regard. But he comes backed by a thousand men, and before the King was firmly seated on his throne. A less forgiving man than David would, under the circumstances, have gladly passed over Shimei's offence. Besides, the company he come in was manifestly bad. We know nothing of the thousand men of Benjamin, except they inherited the deeds of some of their ancestors, and then they would even have outdone Shimei. The bad com- pany was Ziba. It is a matter of reasonable doubt whether Ziba suffered any reproach whatever from the community in which he lived for the contemptible manner in which he had at- tempted to defraud his master's son both in reputation and property, especially when part of this attempt was crowned with ultimate success. The world then, as regarded nice distinctions between right and wrong, was only in its child- hood. Its materialism had but very small alloy of the spiritual. To overreach one in those days was a matter of pride, not shame. Even the patriarch Jacob deceived his poor old infirm father! and how adroitly he fleeced Laban, his father-in-law. To be sure, Laban, in matrimonial affairs, had overreached him, but that is only another instance of the disease of the times. And how did David receive these brace of worthies?- Shimei with his thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba with his fifteen sons and twenty servants? If Abishai's sugges- tion had been followed, it would have fared but illy for Shimei! But King David was too grateful to God for so soon bringing him back by the very road he had so little previously trod in bitterness of heart, again to his throne and kingdom, to mark his happy restoration by blood shedding. He pro- nounced a general amnesty. No man should be put to death. -So Shimei owed his pardon to no special regard the King had for him. David looked upon him as a person     "O         ATHALIAH. dangerous to the welfare of the kingdom, and it was from no personal motives that the King afterwards left instruc- tions with Solomon which resulted in a sudden clipping of the thread of Shimei's life. But David's reception of Ziba must be viewed in con- nection with another incident-the reception of Mephibosh- eth. When this son of one who was formerly David's best friend appeared, he came in the garb of a mourner, ut- terly careless and forgetful of his person in his anxiety and grief for David's distress. He explains to the King why he had not followed him. It was his intention so to do, but Ziba had hasted away on the ass Mephibosheth had ordered him to saddle for his own use. The language of this lame son of Jonathan is eminently moderate, sincere, and submissive, and wins for him through- out the interview our kindliest sympathy. Ziba says noth- ing worthy of record. Judging by the light we have, Da- vid's failure to punish the treacherous servant was unworthy a great King. He seems, too, to have dismissed the subject in a too imperious manner. True, he recalled the decree of confiscation, and left matters where they had been. For it must be noted, he says, "I have said thou and Ziba divide the land." Now, unless this refers to some new arrange- ment made at this interview, it can only relate to the time when the King made Ziba the overseer of Mephibosheth's large estate. It must be confessed that such interpreta- tion is rather forced. The rendering of the Hebrew doctors is more probable, that the King actually now divided the estate between them, ashamed to acknowledge that he had so erred in its entire confiscation, and also afraid that the too great wealth of Mephibosheth might make him ambitious. These same doctors add, that a voice from the heavens de- clared that God would thus divide David's kingdom between Jeroboam and Rehoboam. But before this interview took place in Jerusalem, an in- cident had occurred that interrupted the peaceful and happy course of events, and brought once more upon the land the blight of civil war. David's marked preference for his own tribe was not long in producing its evil fruits. The men of Judah with half the men of Israel meet the King and con- duct him over Jordan.  We may conceive there were mutterings among the men of Israel, which did not, how-   THE RETURN TO JERUSALEM.      141 ever, openly break out till the rest of the ten tribes had joined the triumphal procession. Then sprang up a sharp contention. Judah claimed the eminence in being near of kin to the King. The ten tribes justly reasoned, that as David was King of the twelve tribes, they had ten parts in him, and ought to have been the first to lead him back. The men of Judah felt their consequence as the fighting tribe too much to recede. From the commencement of the commonwealth they had always furnished the greatest number of soldiers, and from the encouragement they would naturally receive from David, they must have grown to be a match in the field for the ten tribes combined. We know they proved so when the king- dom was divided; and yet the time that intervened being an interval of peace, was not calculated to increase the military strength of the tribe of Judah. It is, however, a matter of record that they could out-talk the ten tribes. "The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel." For when Sheba, a man of Belial, blew a trumpet and said, "We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O! Israel," the great majority of the ten tribes followed him. But all the tribes of Judah clave to the King. The different manner in which David looked upon this re- volt and the previous one argues a wide-spread disaffection   among the men of Judah in the former rebellion. He now goes to Jerusalem, knowing he can be the attacking party, and thus preserve the Holy City from the jeopardy of a siege. He openly deposes Joab, leaving only a portion of the army under him, conferring the entire command of the whole upon Amasa, Absalom's late general. Amasa possessed a great influence in the tribe of Judah: "' He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as the heart of one man." We- must, however, recollect that the men of Judah were willing to have their hearts thus moved. Amasa possessed one defect that utterly marred that success his qualities as a general might have won for him. He lacked promptness. On two occasions he showed this. Had he been present in Jerusalem when Ahithophel pro- posed an immediate pursuit of David, humanly speaking Absalom's cause would have succeeded. For Amasa's     "2         ATHALIAH. generalship would have urged this course as the proper one, and his influence carried it through. It miscarried because Absalom treated of it in a civil council instead of a military one. Such were the means God used to make the wrath of man to praise him. On the second occasion his lack of promptness cost him his life, or if Joab's sword had at length reached him it would have been after he had somewhat atoned for his late rebellion by winning an almost bloodless victory for the King. And thus we speculate on what might have been, and form new combinations in the chequered field of life; too apt to forget that over all One reigns, whose mind is infi- nite to plan, whose arm is almighty to execute all things that come to pass. CHAPTER XXIV. A PARTING. BEFORE King David's army had returned to Jerusalem, the glad tidings had reached Gibeon that his cause had tri- umphed, and that the guilty Absalom had paid the penalty of rebellion with his life, while his misguided followers had returned to their former allegiance to the King. Miriam, after assuring herself of the truth of this intelli- gence, left Gibeon with her household servants and went to Jerusalem, and was thus ready to receive in the house en- deared to them all by so many tender recollections, her brothers and Benaiah on their return. Thus, with almost the suddenness of the great affliction of her grandfather's death, had come this grand solace to her grief. In the joy of that meeting was whelmed the memory of the sorrow hardly passed. Her brothers safe, and both again united in their loyalty to the King! Benaiah's valor at last appreciated and rewarded by the hands of royalty! But not long can such sweet oblivion to life's troubles last! When the first glad greetings had been exchanged,   A PARTING.         143 Miriam remembered the sad story she had to tell, and the sunlight faded from her face. 'She did not keep back the terrible fact that Ahithophel had died by his own act. This was the bitterest ingredient in the cup of her sorrow. When she first discovered it, for it could not long be con- cealed from her, it fell on her heart with the weight of a new affliction. Though the effort was a severe one, she told all the sad and bitter story, and felt her burden lightened, for it was now shared by loving and sympathizing hearts. When Miriam first heard of Sheba's revolt, she was much troubled, and said she feared the sudden clearing of their sky was only the precursor of another storm; but when assured by her brothers and Benaiah that it would soon be terminated, she took courage and was comforted. Two hours, thus strangely alternated by joy and sorrow, alarm and subsequent peace, had fled, when Miriam be- thought her of a message she had received the day previous from Reuben for Benaiah, and which she had promised to give him immediately on his arrival in Jerusalem. She had not seen Reuben herself. It was Rachel who had received the message from him. Its substance was this: "Reuben would be waiting to see his brother in the grove of palm trees near the great stone by Gibeon. He could not wait in Jerusalem for his return, and as it was important he should see Benaiah, he hoped he would lose no time in seeking him." "There has been a general pardon proclaimed by the King," said Helem; "send, then, to thy brother, Reuben, to come to Jerusalem, since he can do so without fear, and then, Miriam, thy four scarf-bearers will all be united." "I fear he intends joining Sheba," replied Benaiah. "I had better comply with his request, though I am loth to take to the road again, when I have found such a delightful haven of rest. Perhaps I may win him back to loyalty, and that will certainly compensate me for my self-denial." His words won an approving smile from Miriam, which might have been Benaiah's object in uttering them. He exchanged significant glances with Helem, for each had di- vined that Reuben's motive in wishing to see his brother was connected with his rescue in the battle in the wood of Ephraim. A few minutes later he was on the road towards     "4         ATHALIAH. Gibeon. Mounted on a fleet horse, he was not long reach- ing the designated place of meeting. Reuben met him near the grove, beneath whose trees was encamped the little caravan he was conducting to his por- tion in Naphtali, and which had been waiting for Benaiah at this spot for nearly two days. "Reuben! I am heartily glad to see thee," exclaimed Benaiah, after a cordial embrace. "A less generous heart, my brother, would have felt less joy. I fear thou hast risked thy young life, so full of 'blos- som, to rescue but a withered branch." "Withered/! ear Reuben, when it bears such wealth of fruit to me?" "Benaiah, cheering as is the sight of thy sunny face to me, I would not, simply for the pleasure it yields me, have asked thee to leave Jerusalem, even for a few hours. I have summoned thee here solely for thy good. Weakly yield- ing to what was represented to me as the desire of one dearer to thee than all others, I attached to my helmet, in the late battle, a piece of silk. The fluttering in the wind of this insensible thing saved my life, but put in peril thine. Hast any enemies, my brother? The world is bad enough even for that!" "None! Why should I have? I have never injured any." "Not intentionally, I know. But think! Hast thou a rival in Miriam's love?" Benaiah'S color deepened, as he replied, "She had a friend; Ethni, the son of Rebekah; but I can scarce count him a rival. They have known each other since childhood, and nothing more than mere friendship has ever existed between them." "Doubtless, on Miriam's part, this is so. Ethni has never told thee as much?" "No. I do not know him." "He is not a soldier, I believe."' "Thou art mistaken, Reuben, he is. I saw him in the Kfing's audience chamber in Mahanaim. He has lately en- tered the army." "Ah! Was he in the battle of the wood of Ephraim?" "Yes." "In thy thousand?"   A PaRTIG.          145 "No." "In thy division?" "No, he was order-bearer to Joab." "And therefore his duties might call him to any portion of the field. My forebodings were correct, then." This in musing tones, as if speaking to himself. Then, in raised voice, "Benaiah, in the confusion of battle it is likely that thy effort in saving my life was overlooked; or, if noticed, was by friends who would not betray thee. Banish all fear, then, and be as happy as thy bright fortune warrants. But, brother, promise me, nay, swear to me, that should any danger threaten thee from this cause or any other, thou wilt immediately send for me. Thou wilt do this the more read- ily, Benaiah, when I tell thee it was my intention to have followed Sheba in this second revolt, but now I will quietly remain at our mountain home in Naphtali, whither I am about conducting Sarah and our household servants. King David has promised pardon to all who joined in Prince Ab- salom's rebellion. My life is thine, and I will therefore run no further risks. Swear to me, then, my dear brother, at the first indication of danger, thou wilt send for me." "Ah! dear Reuben, thou hast offered me too great induce- ments to decline granting any wish of thine, much less one so easily complied with. As my soul liveth, I will send for thee at the first appearance of danger. I had so feared that thou wouldst join in this new revolt. Now, if thou wilt only dismiss all those gloomy thoughts of vengeance in con- nection with that sin of King David committed so long ago, }  and of which I am sure he has repented-" "Repented! sayest thou, Benaiah!" sternly interrupted Reuben, "when lie still lives in the embraces of Bathsheba, and has made her son heir to the throne! Does the thief re- pent when he still retains and enjoys the use of his plun- der?" "Reuben! for my sake, if from no better motive, speak not thus of the King," exclaimed Benaiah, in tones of earnest en- treaty. "He cannot recall Uriah from the grave; and the put- ting away of Bathsheba now, would only add to the wrong he at first done her. Thou hast said that God was the avenger; thinkest thou not that King David has been sufficiently  punished in the violent death of his favorite son, Absalom, to say nothing of the previous afflictions in his family?" 7     "6          ATHALIAH. "Forgive me, Benaiah, for again forgetting myself. I would not, if I could, disabuse thee of the honor in which thou holdest the King. A truce, then, and for ever, to this subject; the only one, I think, on which we disagree. Come, Sarah, I see, is waiting for us." The brothers advanced to where she stood. The sun was about setting, and its rays of yellow light tipped with fire every object they touched, or threw long quivering shad- ows on the grass. Preparations for departure had already been commenced. The tents had been folded; men and wo- men servants moved about among the trees, gathering to- gether the mules who had been quietly browsing, and load- ing them for the journey. After a few words of general conversation, Reuben left his brother and wife, to give cer- tain directions necessitated by the change in his intention of joining Sheba. Miriam had questioned Benaiah much about Sarah, and it was perhaps his inability to answer all her questions, that prompted him now to notice her more particularly than he had ever done before. That she was elegantly attired, easy and graceful in her manner, gentle yet cordial in her words of welcome, were the first results of his observation. That he felt for her a very tender and brotherly affection, and a deep sympathy for that mysterious sadness that seemed to lurk about her being, which he had noticed before, but more particularly -on this still evening with its placid sky and motionless trees, he was conscious, and showed it in his words. , Elated' with the Change that had occurred in his brother's purposes, in the happy effects of which Sarah was to share so largely, he pictured in words of glowing eloquence a future scarcely ever realized. In Reuben's house of life, Sarah was to occupy the exact position that Miriam was to fill in his. She was to be the angel to allay the tumult of vengeful anger, and drive out the evil spirit of gloom. Beneath her gentle touch the stern but loving brother was to be transformed into a perfectly happy man. Why this effect had never been produced before, Benaiah had never asked himself; while Sarah drank in his words, wildly enjoying the pres- ent moment, heedless of the thirst she knew must follow. A few more blissful moments are in store for her, to be paid for by many an after hour of weary, bitter longing, in   1 ABSALOM'S PILLAR.               147 the solitude of her mountain home. With the hungry reck- lessness of soul that barters future peace for a moment's ! gratification, she yields herself to the full blandishment of her unfettered fancy. The brothers have exchanged words of parting. Benaiah lifts Sarah in his arms and places her on her mule. He Xi^ whispers a few  words of  hope and  encouragement linked with her name, which she hears long afterwards. Then leaving a farewell kiss upon her hand, he mounts his horse and rides away to Jerusalem and Miriam. ii  Sarah, as she rode away with the little caravan, raised to Xj her lips the haind that Benaiah had kissed. Tears fell on it; but powerless were an ocean of such briny drops to wash away the memories of that sunset scene. CHAPTER XXV. X:          ABSALOM S PILLABR. BENAIAH in somethings proved a true prophet. The re- volt was soon crushed out. But Amasa, the new general, was first " put out."  Three days were given to him to con- centrate his forces. He failed to do so, and David rightly es- timating the dangers of delay, empowered Abishai to take the command of such troops as were ready, and give battle to the enemy. Not far from  the very spot where Benaiah had parted from his brother and Sarah, was the place Amasa had ap- pointed for the gathering of the men of Judah. But a few days after that quiet peaceful scene, the air was heavy with the sounds that wait on preparations for war. There would seem to have been some misapprehension in the mind of David as to Amasa's plans, for it seems, after all, he was as ready to go as Abishai and Joab were, though he had not gathered his forces in the time the King required. At this great stone near Gibeon all the forces join, and Amasa. as commander-in-chief, leads them. Joab meets him. affectionately, and kindly enquires of his welfare, and the next minute sends him on the longest journey he ever took,     "8         ATHALIAH. careful to satisfy himself that Amasa is in health before do- ing so. This is the deepest stain that rests upon the char- acter of Joab, and certainly cannot be justified, though it may be somewhat palliated. He was maddened by David's injustice in setting over him a late rebel, while he for many a long year had faithfully served the King; and he simply applied the only remedy he seemed to have for all obstacles -he cut them with his sword. Joab now takes the entire command, his brother not caring to dispute it with him. He pursues the rebels. They avoid an engagement, and en- trench themselves in the city of Abel Beth Maacha. Proba- bly Sheba had not yet had time to get together as many as he had hoped for, and therefore stood a siege to gain time. Unfortunately he had selected a city proverbial for its wis- dom. Any city would naturally enough feel very disin- clined to be impoverished, battered down, and sacked and pillaged; but every city might not possess the faculty of overcoming these threatened difficulties. Strange enough, a woman wrought this deliverance. Was it that the wise men of the city drew back from so dangerous a mission?-for very dangerous it was. Or had this woman by her wisdom made herself the mistress of the city? She goes upon the wall and enquires for Joab. He ap- pears. Assuring herself that she is treating with the com- mander-in-chief, she soon learns that at the price of Sheba's head he will raise the siege. She goes to the people in her wisdom, proceeding cautiously to see how they stand af- fected at such a proposition. By the people, of course, is meant Sheba's military followers. The citizens would have had no power to bring about such a result as followed. Did woman ever give proof of such consummate skill and wisdom? To win the consent of an army to deliver up their leader! True, it was probable that the anger of the men of Israel had materially cooled down. Great numbers ere now had left Sheba, for no single city could have contained the men that first followed him. But still these men had shown considerable purpose in keeping with him. But the woman prevailed. She was playing a desperate game; the stake, her head or Sheba's. She won, and a bloody head was thrown over the walls: the single sacri-   ABSALOM S PILLAR.       149 ice that saved the lives of many, the happiness of many It is a singular coincidence that the only two lives lost in this revolt were those of two of Absalom's greatest generals. For it is conjectured, with considerable show of reason, that Sheba was next in command to Amasa in the Prince's army. After this comparatively bloodless victory the army re- turned to Jerusalem. Absalom, during his lifetime, reared up a pillar in the King's dale, about a quarter of a mile from Jerusalem, to keep in remembrance his name, for his three sons had all died. But how little avail is such a silent remembrancer for one who has left such a record behind him. Wherever the Bible is read, Absalom will be known and remembered but as a shame and reproach. His evil deeds did not die with him. The unhappy effects of the rebellion which he brought forth, were felt long afterwards. He, by his wiles, had snapped asunder the bond of union that had existed among the tribes. This bond was so firm and per- fect that it had sustained more than one severe shock. The sin of the Benjamites followed by the wholesale slaughter of almost the entire tribe-the foolish jealousy of the tribe of Ephraim, and the bloody expiation they made for it, had left this bond of union intact. And why should it not have remained so? What nation was ever more closely cemented? They all traced their genealogy to one common head, and, though numbering millions, they could all accurately estimate the exact rela- tionship they bore each other. Their fathers had shared alike in all the triumphs and difficulties of their early his- tory. They had witnessed the severe punishment of Egypt by their almighty King, and had been equally punished for their lack of confidence in this great Monarch by a forty years' sojourn in the wilderness. But it is not simply in a knowledge of the early history of their nation that had bound them so closely together. The true bond of union is the one common religion they profess. Once church and state had been a unity. The state was the church, and the church was the state. But these grown-up children must have the glittering toy of royalty. Other nations had -it. Not a decade of years     150         ATHALIAH.. passed after the establishing of the Hebrew monarchy, when a heathen people abolished this very form of royalty after which the Jews had lusted. But to return. Though this perfect identity of church and state had been lost, yet the connection that now ex- isted between them was more close and intimate than it has ever been since in any nation. And yet Absalom con- trived to snap this bond of union. He arrayed against each other, in deadly conflict, not only men of the same blood, but of the same religion. But the rebellion is crushed, and peace and union again restored. When the sword is again unsheathed, the ban- ner unfurled, it is in presence of a foreign foe. But who eannot see that this calm is only on the surface; that this broken bond of union has only been partially joined to- gether. Dash a beautiful and costly vase upon the ground, and though, by skill, you can rejoin the fragments, and ce- ment them together so as to produce the original form, yet, is it the same vase, either in strength or beauty? No. Neither was the Jewish nation the same as it had been ere the marring hand of Absalom was laid upon it. If you would see the full effects, then, of this beautiful tempter's work, this shining seraph of the Jewish para- dise, you need not look at the battle-field of the wood of Ephraim, with its score thousand dead; you need not fol- low the sad intelligence to desolated homes, that told thousands of wives that they were widows, thousands of little children that they were orphans. No. This river of blood and tears, though more than enough to carry the name of its infamous author to furthest time, was not all. Pass over the next half century's tranquillity-a tranquillity, however, marred at its commencement by more treason and more blood. God's house is now to be built, and the hearts of the nation are turned to this holy work. Then comes the reign of the most magnificent of Oriental kings; magnifi- cent not less in mind than person. From far Ethiopia comes a sovereign Queen to testify her curiosity and admiration. No wonder that tranquillity should reign with a King who shed such lustre on his kingdom, and whose subjects joined in the observance of one religion, whose ritual had never been equalled in beauty and grandeur by any of the sur- rounding nations.   ABSALOM'S PILLAE.       151 But how suddenly all this changes. The nation becomes divided. Ten tribes, the same that revolted under the lea- dership of Absalom, separate themselves and form a new kingdom. The head of this new kingdom, though appointed by God's prophet, yields to a worldly policy, and sets up a new form of worship, well knowing that if his subjects en- gaged in the same ritual, and prayed in the same temple as tile people of Judah, a union might again take place. He therefore sets up two golden calves as symbols of God's presence. The first false step taken, the nation soon sinks to a base idolatry. It would be unjust to make Absalom alone accountable for all the sin and misery that this departure from the true worship of God brought upon the kingdom of Israel. But he certainly is partially accountable for it, inasmuch as he first caused a rupture in the union of the nation-a rupture which was only partially healed, and afterwards became sundered, never again to be re-united. Who can estimate the full effect of even a single sin? How it increases and multiplies year by year. Absalom did not attain the full stature and strength of the sinner he proved himself in a single year. The beginnings of sin might have been mere vanity. The circumstances of his princely life would only be so many incentives to it, till at length it might grow into ambition. It is a question whether Absalom's murder of his brother Amnon, was not committed rather to remove an obstacle to the throne, than to avenge his dishonored sister. I; How awful the interest that clusters around the begin- nings of sin in the heart of Absalom! Once, he was a play- ful, guileless, beautiful child. Tossing back the clustering curls of his luxuriant hair from his smooth, open brow, his clear eye full of the animation and unflinching look of fearless childhood, he played, and laughed, and romped, and shouted) just as the whole generation of boys before and after him have done. And what did this beautiful, open-hearted child become? The murderer of his brother; in all but deed, the murderer of his father and his King; a traitor and dismemberer of the holy bond of union that for centuries had bound together God's chosen family. Thrice had God called him to repent- ance and submission, in the death of his sons. The only re-     152         ATHALIAB. suit was, the erection of a pillar in the'King's dale, to keep alive the remembrance of his name after he had passed from earth. That pillar has long since mingled with the dust that lay round it, and been scattered far and wide. But wherever the Scriptures are read, men shudder at the dark fate, but darker sins, of the beautiful and princely Absalom.   BOO   II. "GHT AND DARKNESS. CHAPTER I. X THE INVITATION ACCEPTED, IN a room furnished with Oriental luxuriousness, Atha- liah and Ethni held their first interview after the return of the army from the city of Abel. He had accompanied Joab in his expedition; and though his hopes of preferment had become dimmed in the partial eclipse that Joab had suf- XI  fered, yet when his patron had regained even more than former power, these hopes grew brighter than ever. In the dress and attitude of Athaliah, there was the same elegance and grace that had at first won the admiration, and ? mayhap something more ardent, of the impulsive Ethni. Certainly this woman was no plaything to wile away a soldier's leisure hours. Ethni felt that she was as dangerous as he was beautiful, and that to love her might simply mean death. He had ample evidence of the way Joab dealt with obsticles in his path. But what child of a sunny clime ever turned aside from the path of love, because danger lay there; nay, would not rather feel it only an additional inducement. Such, at least, were Ethni's feelings. But was Miriam quite forgot- ten? no, only not remembered when the captivating beauty of Athaliah was before him, or the rich music of her voice ringing through his heart. Soon after Ethni's return to the city, Athaliah had sent for him. She graciously welcomed him; and the old fascina- tion that the interview in the city of Mahanaim had given birth to, and which each subsequent meeting had tended ,     15     :    ATHALIAH. only to increase, revived at the sight of her. When absent, this fascination seemed almost wholly to disappear. Then his thoughts, when free from the exciting duties of his new profession, were divided between love for Miriam and ven. geance on Benaiah. On his way to this interview, an incident had occurred that tended to whet his appetite for revenge on his favored rival, and which the presence of Athaliah had only power for the moment to soften, but by no means eradicate. He had met Helem, who was as gay and thoughtless as ever. It was just then broad, glorious sunshine in the hori- zon of his life. All the forebodings of trouble to Benaiah had vanished, simply, forsooth, because Benaiah was very joyous and happy himself. Adin had had a personal inter- view with the King, who had so fully and freely pardoned his treason, that one would be justified in thinking that love and friendship for Absalom atoned for all faults in the eyes of the fond father. Helem hailed Ethni with all the boisterous gayety pecu- liar to impulsive temperaments, talked about the terrible battle they had at Abel, regretted he had not been there to share in the laurels so gallantly won, but then he might have had some terrible cuts, and perhaps it was just as well he had remained to defend Jerusalem. Ethni could not and did not care to resist the influence of this good-natured raillery; He laughingly retorted, and the two re-enacted many a scene of the early days of their friendship. - Just as they were about parting, Helem suddenly recol- lected he had something important to tell. How near he came forgetting it! The ceremony of the espousals of Be- naiah and Miriam was to be celebrated that very evening. But few had been invited. But of course he must come. As Helem spoke of the few who had been invited, he thought of the reasons, and his tones grew sad. He waved his hand for farewell and hurried away. And did not Ethni think too of the dead? Yes, of dead hopes-dead, but unburied-almost always present to his sight. But this memory exerted no softening influence upon his heart. It maddened him, and as he pursued his steps to Athaliah's house he meditated vengeance on Be- naiah.   THE INVITATION ACCEPTED.     155 Not less grateful to his ears than the welcome Athaliah extended to him, were the words that followed. i:!"Ethni, I have sent for thee that we might consult about putting a very ardent desire of thine into execution. I think the proper moment has arrived." "It has, indeed," eagerly responded Ethni. i   Athaliah was not prepared for so much eagerness. It equalled nearly his impetuosity at their interview in Ma- hanaim. "The ceremony of espousal is to take place this very eve- ning," was Ethni's answer to Athaliah's enquiring look. "Where didst thou hear this?" On my way here I met Miriam's brother, Helem, who invited me to be present at the ceremony," replied Ethni, in a sneering tone. "Thou wilt accept this invitation?  "Yes, Helem took it for granted I would come." Athaliah regarded her visitor with a keen gaze. She easily learned from the tone and expression of Ethni, that he had no intention of keeping himself out of sight in the affair of Benaiah's arrest. This evidently satisfied her. "Art thou willing to be guided by my advice in this matter?" enquired Athaliah, in her softest and most seduc- tive tones. if"In every particular, beautiful Athaliah; only let the arrest be made before this ceremony takes place." "Before-!" and there was much significancy in the tone of the beautiful temptress. Ethni understood the suggestion. His dark eye flashed as he replied, Yes, he shall be torn from her side in the midst of the ceremony." "Ethni, thou hast been cruelly wronged by this Benaiah, and I will show thee my friendship in enabling thee to be terribly avenged. I doubt not that it was by thy rival's suggestion that the thoughtless Helem invited thee, the disappointed suitor, to be a witness of his triumph over thee." It needed no dark sorcery to raise a tempest of hate and revenge in Ethni's heart.       *  "I will be a witness of something else than his triumph; it shall be my triumph and his disgrace!"     156         ATHALIAH. "And now, Ethni, to perfect our plans. Time passes. Thou must first go to Joab. An immediate interview is necessary. If an audience is denied thee, send him this ring, and thou wilt immediately be admitted. Make thy accusa- tion of Benaiah clear and brief. Joab will be ready enough to proceed against him. Offer to superintend the arrest, and take with thee, if possible, some soldiers who have a spite against Benaiah." "I know such," eagerly exclaimed Ethni. "Three men whom Benaiah had tried for insubordination. They were found guilty, but Joab pardoned them, and drafted them into another company." "If Joab for any reason should refrain from immediately proceeding in this matter, tell him I wish to see him. Then leave the rest to me." There was a brief pause. Ethni was the first to speak. "How shall we be able to prove Benaiah's treason? I have made every exertion to find the two assailants of Reuben, having conversed with all the men who were en- gaged in that portion of the field where the rescue took place. I am forced to the conclusion that they were among the slain." How well this beautiful temptress knew how it could be done. Her only answer, however, was a searching look. Ethni was too young in villainy to understand that look, so she was obliged to speak. "Were those three men, of whom thou spakest, engaged in that part of the field?" Ethni understood her now. There was enough left of good in his heart to send an ambassador to his cheek, in the shape of a blush, to protest against such an infernal suggestion. But, before that blush faded away, Satan whispered to him, that as Benaiah was certainly guilty of the deed of which he was to accuse him, that it would only be a little irregular to suborn two or three men to testify against him. Ethni decided. "Yes, they were in Benaiah's company, and they will be glad to testify against him." "'Thou knowest Benaiah to be guilty. It were a pity that justice should go unsatisfied because a couple of men happen to be killed. Place Rizpah in communication with these men; she will arrange it. But wait! There can be   TIE BETROTHAL.       157 no danger. To betray thee, they would have to betray themselves." "True. I will arrange that in due time. And now, dear Athaliah, I must away to Joab." "Farewell, and success , attend thee," and Athaliah extended her hand. Ethni hurriedly kissed it. Perhaps too hurriedly, for Athaliah still further detained him. j  "In thy interview with Joab, Ethni,"-how differently the wily woman pronounced these two names,-" be guard- ed, for both of our sakes. He is terribly jealous." No hurried kisses of that delicate hand now. "For our sakes." Let Miriam go! For her rejection he would re- pay scorn. He would win this queenly Athaliah, even from the haughty and powerful Joab. Could he have seen the scornful and exultant smile that sat on her face the moment he left the room, he might have had some idea what a poor, miserable dupe she was making of him. Could he have looked into the fearful recesses of her heart, how he would have been startled to find that she was planning even a more terrible destiny for him than for Benaiah. CHAPTER II THE BETROTHAL. THE few guests that had been invited to witness the cere- mony of the espousal of Benaiah and Miriam had assem- bled. Rachel had had some difficulty in getting possesson of her mistress in what she considered proper time to prepare her for the rite. It required no little diplomacy to accomplish this result. She made up her mind that the guests might better be kept waiting, than that anything should be want- ing to make her beloved mistress the loveliest of Jewish maidens. The room in which the ceremony was to be celebrated, was furnished with almost royal elegance. The hangings were of the finest texture, and richest colors. Silver lamps richly engraved hung from the ceiling. Golden censers,     xoL         ATHALIAH. emitting rich perfumes, rested on silver brackets fixed in the walls. The tables were of ivory, inlaid with gold and , mother-of-pearl. Twelve porphyry pillars delicately orna- mented sustained a slab of silver on which rested drinking vessels of gold of the most elegant workmanship, gemmed with precious stones. A canopy somewhat similar to the one used in the marriage ceremony had been erected, under which the lovers were to stand when the ring of betrothal was given. It was made of light blue silk in the form of a dome, the inner surface of which was delicately encrusted with precious gems, and was supported on four pillars of porphyry. The guests, with the venerable priest who was to perform the ceremony, had all assembled before Benaiah and Miriam entered the room. Miriam never looked so lovely. She was dressed in white, with simplicity, yet elegance. Her dark luxuriant hair was elaborately arranged. Here Rachel overcome all the opposition of her mistress, and finally suc- ceeded to her entire satisfaction. If she used rather more diamonds, pearls and emeralds, than Miriam liked, yet she formed a crown of glory for that beautifully shaped head that queens might have envied. Miriam bowed to the guests with a sweet and quiet dig- nity, and motioned to the priest to proceed immediately with the ceremony. They stood side by side beneath the canopy. The joyousness of their hearts was softened and subdued by the solemnity and significancy of the scene. The priest ceased speaking, and Benaiah produced the ring of betrothal. There was a stillness in the apartment peculiar to Oriental life. No sound within, no sound from without permitted to enter. Suddenly this stillness was rudely invaded. Loud voices and the tramp of armed men were heard. Involuntarily all eyes were turned towards the entrance to the room. Ben- aiah's heart sank within him. The ring dropped from his hand. Total shipwreck had come at last. Rapidly the hangings were dashed aside and Ethni ap- peared, immediately followed by several soldiers. Helem sprang forward at sight of his friend and exclaimed, in a tone of surprise mingled with anger: "Ethni, what means this intrusion?" "; Didst thou not invite me?" retorted Ethni with a sneer. Then raising his voice he proceeded:   THE BETROTHAL.        159 "I arrest Benaiah on a charge of abetting traitors while in the service of the King." lBenaiah and Miriam still stood under the canopy--the one transfixed with grief, the other stupified with wonder  i   and dismay. Rachel had hurried to the side of her mistress, I:i  while Zillah (for the household servants had occupied a place in the further end of the room) kept her eyes fixed upon Ethni as if she would read his very heart. i!  The priest had left the spot he had occupied before the }: lovers, and confronting Ethni, said in tones of dignity and authority hard to withstand: :8!  "Son, wouldst thou not have better performed thy duty, s5;F if thou hadst waited till this solemn rite of betrothal had been concluded, instead of thus rudely interrupting it? With- sVX  draw now with these rude men of war and let the sacred rites of our religion be solemnized. I will be responsible for the custody of him thou hast been ordered to arrest." The soldiers looked at Ethni. Though he was somewhat impressed with the calm dignity of the priest, yet he de- termined to proceed to any extremity rather than have the betrothal consummated. "My orders are peremptory. Soldiers, do your duty." The men advanced to where Benaiah stood. Helem's sword flashed from its sheath, and he threw himself infront A of Benaiah, who, of course, was unarmed. Benaiah hastened forward, and laying his hand upon Helem's right arm, exclaimed, "Helem, no violence!" Then turning towards Ethni, he said in tones of forced calmness, "By whose orders am I thus arrested?" "By those of my lord Joab," was the cold reply. The calm dignity with which Benaiah questioned him, maddened Ethni. Still his passions did not so blind him but that he saw the impolicy of displaying anything like personal spite. Drawing from his girdle a piece of parch- ment, he handed it to Benaiah and said: "Judge for thyself." Benaiah ran his eye rapidly over the order, handed it back and said, "One moment." He then turned towards Miriam; but from a sign made by Ethni the soldiers ad- vanced rapidly and laid their hands upon him. The next moment they lay on the floor, precipitated thither by the vig- orous arms of Benaiah, now stung to madness. But this     160          ATHALIAH. was only sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind. The next moment he was overpowered by numbers and dragged from the apartment. The priest had succeeded in restraining the impetuosity of Helem only by throwing himself in his way. As Benaiah was forced away, Miriam sank in the arms of Rachel, hap- pily unconscious. As this faithful girl bends over her pale mistress, she looks like an angel of compassion; when she raises her eyes and fixes them on Ethni, she looks like a minister of vengeance. Ethni notices her threatening looks, and smiles scornfully in return. The sparkle of the betrothal ring catches his eye, lying on the floor where Benaiah had dropped it. He advances towards it and raises his mailed heel to crush it. Quick as thought Rachel catches a scarf and sweeps the ring towards her. Then fixing her keen unflinching gaze upon him, said: "This ring will answer for another time." Ethni, without deigning a reply, turned and strode haughtily away. CHAPTER II. THE COUNCIL OF LOVE. WHEN Miriam returned to consciousness, she found only her brothers and Rachel with her, who still supported her in her arms. The guests had all departed. She looked around her, glanced at her dress, and said, "Where has Benaiah gone?" Then, suddenly recalling the late stormy scene, she ex- claimed, "Oh -they will kill him! Let me go and die with him!" "Dear sister," said Helem, " compose thyself. No im- mediate danger threatens Benaiah." "Danger! Danger!" slowly repeated Miriam.  What danger is there? Oh! tell me why he has been taken away from me!" "By some treachery of Ethni," whispered Rachel. "Fear not, we will overcome him yet."   D 11ITHE COUNCIL OF LOVE.              161 Helem, who was bending over his sister, caught the words of theserving-maid, and-hastily added, "Miriam, dear sister, Ethni regards Benaiah as a favored X:  rival in thy affection, and, from jealousy, he has made some accusation against thy lover, which he can never prove. Take courage, then! All will yet be well!" But the use of anything like subterfuge was growing every moment less needful. Miriam was gradually recov- ering all her accustomed strength of purpose. With that subtle apprehension that a keenly interested heart gives the intellect, she perceived that Helem was striving rather to comfort her than to acquaint her with the simple truth. She, therefore, replied with a calmness that surprised him: X "Helem, there is danger to Benaiah-great danger. Tell me, plainly, what it is for. I think thou knowest all. I can bear it now. Let me have the truth, terrible though it may be!" "Dear sister, do not alarm thyself," said Adin. "This charge against Benaiah, whether true or false, must relate to the battle in the wood of Ephraim. Thou hast reason to know how readily the King pardoned all offenders then, i for am not I here with thee?" Miriam pressed her brother's hand, in gratitude for his kind words. She sadly shook her head, as she replied: "Adin, dear brother, I fear thou art mistaken in cherish- ,I ting such hopes. Helem, if he will, can tell us more certainly about it, for he was Benaiah's almost constant companion." Miriam's strength began to influence Helem. He saw that the wiser course now was boldly to face the stern re- i alities of coming events, and not to hide from them. "Yes, Adin, thou art mistaken. There is danger, though eI  not immediate, and to attempt to conceal it will only in- crease it. I will tell all, and then we will plan some way to save our dear Benaiah." Helem hesitated a moment, before commencing his re- cital, and glanced towards Rachel, as if asking Miriam if he should divulge the secret in her presence. "Fear not, Helem, to speak before Rachel," was Mi riam's answer to her brother's unspoken question. "She is wholly devoted to me." Tears gushed into the keen black eyes of the serving maid as she pressed Miriam's hand to her lips. Such a     162          ATHALIAH. token of feeling was unusual with her; but she had ob- served and understood Helem's glance; and the kind, ap- proving words of her beloved mistress, evincing such confidence in her fidelity, had overcome her. Helem then proceeded to give a detailed account of the whole affair. He commenced by narrating the incidents that had occurred in the house in which Benaiah and him- self had lodged the day previous to the battle. How Be- naiah had been startled at the sound of a woman's voice; his warning when he, Helem, had attempted to discover the author; then his announcement of the woman's power over Joab, as manifested in the commander's tent, upon the occasion of Benaiah's requesting the post of bearer of dis- patches to the King. Then he proceeded to tell of his awaking from a troubled dream after Benaiah's departure. He hears again that woman's voice, and she pronounces Benaiah's name. Some one is evidently telling her that he is her fellow lodger. Then Joab's approach is announced, and Helem hears his heavy tread. An interview takes place in an adjoining room. He hears every word. Helem now for the first time hesitates. His courage fails. He dares not tell of the horrible enmity this woman bears Benaiah. But Miriam divines the cause of this hesitancy, and says to her brother in tones painfully calm: "Helem, do not fear to tell the worst. If it exists, thy telling it does not increase it." Thus encouraged, Helem continues, and tells, though with considerable effort, that this woman who so swayed the haughty and powerful Joab, entertained the most deadly hatred for Benaiah-a hatred that craved something more than his mere death. And yet Benaiah had never to his knowledge seen her face, and had heard her voice but twice -the first time raised in his behalf, and the second time un- intelligible to him; for when her voice had startled him in the house in Mahanaim, it was int a room so far removed that he could only distinguish its sounds. "Dost thou know who this fearful woman is?" enquired Miriam with an involuntary shudder. "Yes. After Joab's departure I looked through the hangings, and instantly recognized her." "Thou knowest her, then. Who is she?" exclaimed Adin.   THE COUNCIL OF LOVE.  '    163 Hi An enquiring look of Helem whether he should announce it in Rachel's presence, being answered by Miriam in the ' L affirmative, he replied : "It was Athaliah, the cousin of Rebekah." X   He explained Benaiah's depression on the evening of the battle and told its cause. How Benaiah, attracted by the piece of Miriam's scarf attached to the helmet of his brother, had recognized Reuben just at the moment when he was overcome by two assailants; how on the impulse of the mo- -ilF Wment he had dashed forward and overthrew them, thus res- cuing his brother from a certain death. I Helem further told his auditors that he had made many efforts, of d very guarded kind, of course, to find out who   these assailants were but without success. Miriam's heart sank lower within her when she reflected that the means she had planned to keep the brothers from slaying each other might result in her lover's death, after all. "They cannot prove this charge," confidently asserted Adin. "The confusion and tumult of the contest must have covered it." 'Rachel's love for Miriam made her bold. She was one of the council, and she would speak. aI;   "Where was Ethni in this battle?" "He was order-bearer to Joab," replied Helem.  "Then he likely witnessed this rescue of Reuben?" "But how could he recognize Benaiah? Ethni's post was generally in the rear of the fighting men," said Adin, ': Jsomewhat contemptuously, whether concerning Ethni or Rachel was not apparent. '"By the piece of my dear mistress' scarf which Benaiah X -Ht! wore on his helmet." Rachel then turned towards Miriam and asked: "Did not Ethni give thee this scarf?" "Yes," quickly replied Miriam, c; I see it all. Ethni re- cognized it, and he easily imagined who was the wearer." "Thou art right, only imagine who wore it," replied Adin. That scarf was separated into parts. Can he prove that it was not I who defended Reuben?" i "Alas! Yes," groaned Helem," for it is well known thou wert not engaged in the conflict." A sudden gleam of ani- mation flashed over his face after pronouncing these words. After this he discussed the plans of others with a careless     164         ATHALIAH. prodigality, as if he had one in reserve that would settle all difficulties. "If they prove this charge," proceeded Adin, " what chance is there of the King pardoning him?" "None," promptly responded Helem. "He may have the wish to do it, but not the power. Only a little while ago, as thou knowest, he attempted to depose Joab, and make Amasa commander-in-chief. Joab slays Amasa, takes the command again, and David is obliged to confirm it." "But, Helem, there may be reasons for this compliance," urged Miriam, "which would not extend to the pardon of a single life. Didst thou not tell me he pardoned Shimei, who cursed him, though Joab's brother twice asked permis- sion to take off his head?" "Dear Miriam, if I did not think it a sheer loss of time and effort, I would counsel thee to go to Bathsheba, who would have greater influence with the King than thou wouldst hope to have. But recollect that this Athaliah is Benaiah's greatest enemy. She governs Joab. Go to her, if to any." "But thou canst not plead to the King for Benaiah's par- don till he is found guilty of the charge his enemies have brought against him," suggested Adin. "After that, such supplication may be thought of." "Yes, but I can plead with this woman who has such bitter enmity against Benaiah," responded Miriam, "and if she has a woman's heart, I will soften it." "But we are not supposed to know either that she has influence with Joab, or enmity against Benaiah," exclaimed Helem, in alarmed tones. "Yes, but fortunately we do know it," replied Adin, confidently, "and in a manner unknown to her. This knowledge, so mysteriously gained, may alarm her into some concessions." "And it may, also, place us all on the list of her ene- mies," responded Helem. "I dread an enemy that works by secret means." "I fear her not," said Miriam, "my trust is in the Lord, and on His strength will I rely." "But thou must not neglect to do all thou canst, my dear mistress,'T replied Rachel. "All that is right and lawful to do, Rachel. I shall use   Xl       THE COUNCIL OF HATE.      165 no deception. If it is the Lord's will that Benaiah must die, His will be done." Miriam's voice faltered. She buried her face in her hands, and burst into tears. "Rachel, conduct thy mistress to her room," said Helem, "we shall all be the better for repose. The Lord be with thee, dear sister," and Helem stooped down, and kissed Miriam's pale cheek, from which the roses had been so ruthlessly torn away. All else remained; but what a bitter mockery were betrothal dress and costly jewels now. CHAPTER IV. 4f e X        THE COUNCIL OF HATE. I::  BENAIAH had been placed in ward, with strict injunc- K  tions to the guard to admit no one, without they bore a X   written permission from Joab. This was the result of Atha- :sHi' liah's refined cruelty. The morning after the arrest, Helem had made every ef- fort to see Benaiah, but had failed. In reply to the request he had sent to Joab, through one of his officers, for he was denied admission, he received answer that if he valued his own reputation and safety, he had better interest himself less in traitors. He had returned to Miriam, and told her that for the present she could not see Benaiah, as no one was admitted. aid  While Miriam  was contemplating her interview with Athaliah, and Helem perfecting in his own mind a plan he had conceived, and Rachel straining every fibre of heart and mind in collecting whatever information might be of any use; and while Adin,who, though not actuated by the ar- dor of the other three, was by no means indifferent, was cal- culating the chances of a bodily rescue and successful car- rying off of Benaiah, Athaliah and Ethni were perfecting their plans also, with a much more reasonable show, if not of certain, still very probable success. The wily Athaliah had rightly calculated her powers of fascination over the impulsive and passionate Ethni. She,     166         ATHALIAH. so cool, and calculating, and heartless, had him at a de- cided disadvantage. Without accepting him as a lover, she still cunningly held out to him what he considered fair hopes. She had listened with much interest to his narrative of the previous evening's incidents. Joab, it seems, had read- ily heard the accusation, and furnished him with full power to arrest Benaiah, with an earnestness that plainly proved he was personally interested. He was particularly pleased with Athaliah's complicity as proved by the ring that Ethni had used to gain immediate audience, as it proved that whatever suspicions he might entertain of Athaliah's favor to the young soldier, they were groundless. "And now, Ethni, that we have caged our bird, we must see how we are to manage his final destruction. Recollect it is not merely his death that we seek; we must make it also a disgraceful one." "I have already arranged with two of the three men I spoke to thee about, to testify against Benaiah. To make all sure, I had a proclamation in the King's name made this morning, to all the surviving soldiers that could possibly have been engaged in the quarter of the field where the in- cident occurred, calling upon them to come forward if they could throw any light upon it. I purposely took care that these three men should at the time be absent. None of the soldiers responded. I then arranged with the men I had selected to avow themselves the assailants of the man Ben- aiah rescued, when they should hear the proclamation, which was to be repeated. They did so, and are retained as wit- nesses on the trial." "Excellently managed! But these men need very close instructions. They must agree upon the story in every particular, as they may be examined separately. Let the account be as simple as possible." "Never fear, Athaliah, thy service makes me double my- self. Not only shall their account agree in every particular, but their testimony as to the identity of Benaiah as the man who interfered for the enemy's safety, will be very ex- plicit. The silk he wore on his helmet fixes that." There was a concentrated bitterness in Ethni's tones when he alluded to this mark of recognition that attracted Athaliah's attention. She enquired:   THE COUNCIL OF HATE.       167 ,   "P Dost know certainly where he got this badge, that will probably help him to a dishonored grave?" "Yes, from Miriam." "It is natural to suppose so. But dost thou know this?" }I  "I do. I gave her the scarf myself." "The scarf? Surely he did not wear the whole scarf on his helmet." "No, only a portion of it." he "But what became of the rest. It is not naturalto think he would tear this precious piece of silk." "There is something in this that we must know about," replied Ethni. i "I think I have a clue to the mystery. I heard in Ma- hanaim, while in the presence of the King, that Miriam's brother Adin was among the rebels. Here, then, in the conflicting armies were four brothers arrayed against each other, all more or less dear to Miriam. That scarf was doubtless divided among the four, that they might recognize each other in the conflict, and thus avoid slaying each other." "And that accounts why I saw that silk wave in differ- ent parts of the field nearly at the same time. I only attri- buted it then to Benaiah's great activity." "Thou sawest it, then, also on Helem's helmet." "Helem, to save Benaiah, may avow himself the rescuer of Reuben. It is just like him." "That would avail nothing," replied Athaliah. "He had I not the motive that Benaiah had, and besides, Benaiah would not be base enough to allow the sacrifice. What we have to fear is, that Adin will acknowledge himself the rescuer. He could show a motive for interfering in#Reu- ben's behalf, and bring no peril on himself. There is dan- ger in this!" Athaliah regarded her companion with a steady look, as if trying to read his heart. Did she really think there was danger that their plans would fail, or was she merely try- ing to see how far Ethni was prepared to go. Ethni was confounded. He had never seen Athaliah lose confidence before. She had always appeared all powerful. Ethni replied: "These men can establish Benaiah's identity." "I doubt it. Thou knowest he was their captain but a day before the battle; and the sudden onslaught would not     168          ATHALIAH. qualify them to take such particular notice. Recollect Miriam's near relationship to the Queen. There will be powerful efforts made to save Benaiah. We must proceed with better ground than this. All was as clear as day, till this accursed Adin rose up to defeat our plans." Still Ethni did not take the hint. Athaliah proceeded: "Ethni,"-and she laid her hand upon his arm, which he was not slow to take possession of, for the fascinating woman had thrown a world of tenderness in her tones as she pro- nounced his name-" unless something else presents itself, I fear all our plans are in vain-worse than in vain-for what reproach will we not have brought upon ourselves by this apparently false accusation, for though I am not known in this, still shall I not suffer for thee?" Ethni's infatuation was such that he was quite reconciled to the failure of any plans, so it brought such a manifesta- tion of Athaliah's interest in, if not love for him as this. Athaliah seeing this, felt as if she could strangle him. Withdrawing her hand and raising up her head, which she had just bowed over him, for he was sitting on a lower pile of cushions than herself, she said, in tones of offended pride, with just enough infusion of sadness in them to ex- cite Ethni almost to delirium: "Go, Ethni. Thou dost not love me. We had better part, and for ever." "Love thee!" exclaimed the infatuated young man, fall- ing at her feet and endeavoring to seize her hand. "As my soul liveth I do most madly!" "This is all profession. I tell thee this accursed Adin is going to overthrow all our plans, destroy our happiness, and thou smilest and pressest my hand as if the intelligence were pleasant to thee. Ethni,"--and her assumed excitement lent a still greater charm to her beautiful features, while she arose from her recumbent posture to her feet-"I swear to thee as my soul liveth, this Benaiah has never done me a personal injury in his life, and yet for thy sake I would destroy him thus ;" and Athaliah took from a table near her a beautiful vase, and dashing it on the tessellated marble floor of the room, shivered it in a thousand fragments. "And yet thou wilt allow this pitiable Adin to thwart me so. Go, go, this is not the love I require."   THE OOUNCIL OF HATE.       169 Athaliah, as she pronounced these concluding words, turned from Ethni as if to leave the room. A violent strug- gle was taking place in Ethni's breast. He understood her now. He had risen to his feet when the vase was dashed to the ground, startled by Athaliah's impetuosity. Had the wild tumult in his heart permitted him to think clearly, he would have withdrawn from her on the instant. And as it was, he stood there as if transfixed, his eyes bent down. Athaliah fears she has gone too far, and is rapidly forming in her mind some plan of recovering her lost ground. She however resolves on one last effort to carry out her original purpose. She turns around. Ethni's eyes are downcast. She sighs, and he raises them. There are tears in Athali- ah's eyes-an expression reproachful, yet loving. She con- quers. Ethni hastens towards her, seizes the hands she ex- tends towards him, and falling on his knees, wildly presses them to his burning lips, exclaiming, "Adin shall not live to thwart thee, beloved of my soul!" ?( "Ethni, this test of thy love may never, never be re- quired. We will devise other and safer means. But, oh  it grieved me to think how easily thou couldst give me up." "Give thee up! Never, adorable Athaliah! I am thine, soul and body. Thy will shall be my only law!" A step, resounding on the marble pavement of the corri- dor is heard, approaching the apartment. Athaliah recog- nizes the footsteps of her steward, Caleb. Ethni rises, and covers his emotions by bending over a table, as if in exam- ination of the articles upon it, as the servant enters. "A maiden is in the inner court, who desires, with much earnestness, to see thee." "Dost know who she is?" "In her eagerness she raised her veil for a moment. I think I have before seen her face in Ahithophel's house." "It must be Zillah," said Athaliah, in a half musing tone. Then addressing Caleb, "She must wait. I will see her presently." After Caleb's withdrawal, Athaliah and -Ethni engaged in earnest conversation, carried on in low tones. From words occasionally uttered in a raised voice, they were evi- dently discussing the best method of procuring Benaiah's condemnation. At length they seemed to have fixed upon 8     170         ATHALUH. one, for Rizpah is summoned, and, after a few questions put to her, Athaliah hastily traces a few characters upon a slip of parchment. "Use all possible dispatch, Rizpah," are her closing words, as she places the writing in the Arab woman's hands. "But stay! Zillah is waiting in the inner court to see me. Enquire what she wants." "Zillah here? And desiring to see thee? Impossible!" "Ascertain, then, who she is." "Rizpah disappeared, and, passing through several apart- ments, reached one that looked into the inner court. The day was warm, and Miriam, for it was she, had laid aside her veil. Rizpah at once recognized her, as she walked slowly to and fro, absorbed in her painful reflections. She hastily retraced her steps to the apartment where she had left Athaliah and Ethni. "It is Miriam who is waiting in the inner court." "Miriam!" exclaimed Athaliah. "What does this por- tend? Have we been discovered? This maiden has never spoken to me, and very seldom seen me. Ethni, thou must leave me now. It is important that I should know the ob- ject of this visit at once." She smiled a farewell as she extended her hand. Ethni respectfully raised it to his lips, for Rizpah was still in the room, and withdrew. The sound of his retreating foot- steps had hardly died away, when Athaliah, turning to Rizpah, said, "Rizpah, see that this young man leaves the house. Then bid Caleb conduct this love-sick damsel hither." CHAPTER V. SINCERITY AND CRAFT. ATHALIAH rose to receive Miriam as she entered the apartment, and, with a gracious dignity, bade her welcome. Was this indeed the woman who had vowed a vengeance worse than death against her lover, were Miriam's thoughts,   SINCERITY AND CRAFT.      171 as she stood gazing upon Athaliah, as if to read the secrets of her heart. Athaliah easily divined that by some mysterious means Miriam had become acquainted with her complicity in Be- naiah's arrest. The mischief had been done, and now it only remained to make the best of it. "Thou desirest to see me?" "Yes, most earnestly," replied Miriam, in accents that ought to have softened any heart. "I come to thee as a most wretched suppliant for a life dearer to me than my own.) "As a suppliant to me, beautiful maiden? and for life? I do not understand thee."  "Art thou not an enemy to Benaiah, and hast thou not power to save him even now?" "An enemy to Benaiah! and who is Benaiah? Thou must explain thyself, or I shall think that some trouble has turned thy brain." Miriam looked steadily at her. A woman less practiced in the art of concealing her thoughts would have quailed before the pure and steady light of those soul-lit eyes. Athaliah quietly returned her gaze, as if curious to discover what Miriam meant. The heart of the poor girl sank within her. Helem could not have been mistaken. What hope, then, to soften or in- timidate a woman who could wear such a perfect mask as this? Then she thought of her imprisoned lover, breathed a prayer to Him whose ear is ever open to the briefest aspira- tion of his afflicted children for strength and wisdom, and resolved to make an earnest effort and leave the results with God. "Perhaps thou wouldst know how I gained the knowl- edge that thou wert my lover's enemy, and still had power to save him even now?" This was just what Athaliah wanted, but she did not like the way in which it was brought about. "I very naturally desire some explanation of thy strange conduct." "Thou shalt have it." Miriam hesitated. Was there not danger in sacrificing Helem's safety? and yet if she only used general terms, she could not convince Athaliah how direct her information was.     172         ATHALIAH. Then she recollected Helem'sfears of this woman, and re- flected that for a poor chance of saving her lover, which would almost certainly prove futile, she might as cer tainly lose her beloved brother. She decided, and thus pro- ceeded: "And yet what use of explanation. Either this info rma- tion if it is correct or incorrect. Thou art so false, that I need hope nothing from thee. If it be false, then thou art powerless to help me. Farewell. If thou art wrong, the Lord turn thee from thy evil ways. If true, as thy face betokens thee, the Lord prosper thee in all thy doings." The noble yet gentle dignity in which these words were uttered, affected Athaliah about as much as the dews and rains of heaven the flinty rock. Still she paid great heed to them and turned them to excellent account. She feigned an emotion which Miriam could not but be- lieve genuine, particularly when in tones tremulous in their deep earnestness, she thus spake: "Miriam, thou hast disarmed me! I have deceived thee, but Oh! canst thou not make an allowance for the shame an earlier avowal would have cost me? Thou hast now shown thy true and noble heart, and I will tell thee all. But be- lieve me thou hast been mistaken." Such a sudden change could only have deceived trusting hearts. We will judge others by ourselves. "But didst thou not tell Joab that thou hatedst Benaiah?" gently enquired Miriam. Quick as thought Athaliah recollected the place and time she had told Joab this; that Benaiah was absent on a scout- ing service, and that thus Helem must have played the lis- tener. She recorded in the dark recesses of her heart a leg- acy of revenge for him. "Yes, more than once," said Athaliah, in prompt yet sad tones. "Joab was jealous of Benaiah, because I had once in- terceded in procuring for him the office of bearer of tidings to the King. I heard that his anxiety to go to Jerusalem arose from his desire to see one he dearly loved. I loved once, too, and felt for him." And Athaliah turned away as if to conceal her tears. Then went on speaking: "Miriam, I will confide in thee, for I know thou wilt not turn loathingly from me."   I      8iCSINCERITY AND CRAFT.    173 Confide thy sins and sorrows to God. He will listen mercifully to thee, and forgive. and console thee." "Ah! Thou, too, turnest away from me?" and Athaliah buried her face in her hapds. "Dear Athaliah, if thou wilt let me call thee so, I do not turn from thee. If it is any comfort to thee to confide in me, do so. But do not neglect thy Creator for a poor, sin- ful mortal like myself." Miriam, overcome by Athaliah's apparent distress, forgot the errand on which she came, and thought only of playing the comforter to this lovely specimen of iniquity. Athaliah was using her spare moments in recalling her 4 interview with Joab, in Mahanaim, for she little doubted that Miriam knew it all, and she must play her part accord- ingly. This part was both unpleasant and dangerous, and numerous were the additions she mentally added to that legacy for Helem. "::  ' Dear Miriam,"--and Athaliah took her hand, for they had both sat down on a couch for the first time during this inter- ':: view, -"when I was thy age I loved as warmly and devot- edly as thou dost now. I was cruelly, most cruelly wronged. I had not thy forgiving spirit, and unhappily, sought consolation in revenge. Unfortunately, I met and attracted the attention of Joab. I encouraged him, not be- cause I loved him, for love was for ever dead within me, but because I hoped he would help me to my revenge. To attach him to me I wickedly assumed modes of expression in my intercourse with him, that I judged would fascinate a man of blood and violence. At times, conscience would assail me, but instead of breaking off my evil ways, I at- tempted to appease it, by using the power I had sQ artfully obtained, by performing some good action. Such was my effort in Benaiah's behalf." "Then he is really no enemy of thine," joyfully exclaimed Miriam. "As the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth,"-and Atha- liah raised her hands, while she spoke with all the solemnity of a great oath-"Benaiah has never done me an injury either in word or deed, to my knowledge. Now," she continued, turning her beautiful face full upon Miriam, " can I be an enemy of Benaiah?" "No-no," exclaimed Miriam, and in the height of her     174         ATHALIAI. exultant joy she threw herself into Athaliah's arms, who pressed her to as false a heart as ever beat beneath so beau- tiful and fair a bosom. "And wilt thou not use thy power with Joab to save Benaiah. Oh! do so Athaliah, and our lives will form one prayer for thy forgiveness here, and thy happiness here- after." "Save Benaiah! Is he in danger, then?" "Oh! in great danger. He was arrested last night," and tears gushed into Miriam's soft, earnest eyes, "in the very midst of the ceremony of our betrothal, on a charge of treason." "Dear Miriam," replied Athaliah, anxiously and fondly, "this is the first I have heard of it. Tell me all. Thou mayst depend upon all I can do for thee and thine." Miriam simply recounted to Athaliah the circumstances attendant upon the rescue of Reuben, and its terrible con- sequences in the arrest of Benaiah. "Dear Miriam, I must not disguise from thee that this is a very serious charge. The King had promoted Benaiah, and the next day he strikes down two of the King's soldiers when they were simply performing a loyal duty. Joab I know to be very strict about these matters, and I fear my interference will be of no avail." "But wilt thou intercede for him?" eagerly demanded Miriam. "Canst thou doubt it? I will give thee a letter to Joab, and thou canst add thy entreaties to mine. If this fails, as I fear it will, I will afterwards see him myself," "Oh! the Lord bless thee, Athaliah. Would that my earnest prayers could win thee back to a forgiving temper." "They may, dear Miriam, but let us now think only of thy lover. Thou sayest that Adin also had a piece of thy scarf tied about his helmet. Will he not testify that he was the one that rescued Reuben?" "Benaiah would not owe his life to perjury, and I would not receive it at so fearful a cost," was Miriam's noble reply. But Athaliah was in pursuit of something else than noble sentiments. Still she must notice it. "Noble hearted Miriam! But art sure that it was Be- naiah. Might it not have been Adin, after all."   SINCERITY AND CRAFT.      175 "Too sure. Adin was not in the battle at all, having been with troops that were held in reserve. Besides, Be- naiah confessed it to Helem on the evening of the battle." "Then we must depend upon Joab. I will ring for writ- ing materials." 1  BShe approached the table on which stood the bell, and rang it in the same peculiar manner she had before used. She then advanced toward the hangings that curtained one of the entrances to the room, and said in tones loud enough to be heard by Miriam, to Rizpah: "Bring me some writing materials. I will wait here for them. Make haste." Then in tones impossible to be heard by Miriam, even if she had been listening, which was by no means the case: Has the messenger been dispatched for Reuben?" AX  "He has." "Will it be possible to recall him?" "No. He is too well mounted. Besides I know not the road he has taken." "Go immediately to Joab. Miriam will be the bearer of two written requests from me. Ask him for me to deny the first, but to grant the second. Here is the ring." Athaliah turned, observed that Miriam was not looking toward her, motioned to Rizpah that she desired nothing further, and then seated herself at a writing table, and traced in a delicate hand these words: "MY LoRD JOAB.-It is my earnest wish and most urgent request that thou wilt dismiss the accusation brought against Benaiah, and immediately release him for the dear maiden's sake who bears this, in whom I am deeply inter- ested." "There, dear Miriam, how will that answer? Miriam ran her eyes over the parchment. Hl  "A thousand thanks, kind hearted Athaliah." "Do not hope for too much. I fear Joab will refuse." "He may; so wilt thou add another request?" ( Certainly ; what is it?" "That I may visit Benaiah in his confinement. Admit- tance has been refused in every instance." This request Athaliah had anticipated when she gave Rizpah her instructions to go to Joab. "Ah! Joab cannot deny me that," said Athaliah, with     176         ATHALIAH. well assumed animation; and she added these words to what she had already written: "Shouldst thou for wise reasons refuse me this request, at least allow this sorrowful maiden to visit her lover in prison.                ATHALIAH." "And now, Miriam, make me a solemn promise that thou wilt not reveal anything I have told thee. Let thy inform- ant, whoever he or she may be, think what they will of me, I know thy noble heart will never despise me." "I do most solemnly make this promise, dear Athaliah,. though it costs me much pain to do so. Would that I could be thy advocate. I shall ever love thee and pray for thee, for this," and Miriam pressed the parchment covered with the characters of treachery and deceit to her lips, fragrant with the blessed dew of holy truth. "Let me take thee once more to my heart, dear Miriam. I can do so without shame, for I feel I shall yet be worthy of even thy pure love." Miriam threw herself into Athaliah's arms, her soft sweet eyes full of tears. Her heart was too full to answer. She only murmured "Beloved Athaliah!"  As they kissed each other, her falling tears bedewed Athaliah's cheek. And thus they parted. CHAPTER VI. THE OATH. WE will leave Athaliah dashing disdainfully the tears of Miriam from her cheek, and brooding over her dark de- signs, and follow Miriam to the house Joab made his mili- tary head-quarters while he was in Jerusalem. She had not long to wait in the ante-room, before she was ushered into Joab's presence. As she entered several offi- cers left the room, and so she found herself alone with this celebrated warrior. He arose to receive her, and begged her to be seated, in a voice more of command than invita- tion. Though Miriam had the greatest of all incentives to cour-   THE OATH.         1" age, yet she felt awed in the presence of this man who had so successfully presided over so many hardly contested battles. She shuddered, too, to think of the blood that had so recently stained his hands, and yet mingled with this dread was respect for one who had so long and faithfully supported God's anointed King. She thought it best to trust simply to Athaliah's influence without at first joining any entreaty of her own. It was certainly the easiest method, and without speaking she handed him the letter she had brought. She watched him as he read it, as if life and death waited on his very looks. Alas! her scrutiny brought no hope to her anxious heart. "Maiden, this Benaiah is charged with a great offence. If he is proven guilty, I should be wanting in my duty to King and country to suffer his crime to go unpunished." But, my Lord," said Miriam, with the courage of despe- ration," think how faithfully he has served his King, how g 1 he clung to him when so many forsook him, and that when he erred, it was on the impulse of a moment to save a dear and only brother's life." "But that dear brother was a traitor, and had he struck him to the earth instead of two loyal men, he would have better fulfilled his duty to his King. I cannot further dis- cuss this matter with thee. He must be tried, and if found guilty he must die. Thou mayest however visit him." 8 ^He touched a bell.   A scribe immediately entered. O"fi.  Write an order of admittance to the prisoner Benaiah." The scribe sat down at a table and hurriedly wrote on parchment: "Admit the bearer of this order to see the prisoner Be- naiah." Joab then added a formidable-looking flourish, which he used to designate his name, and handed the order to Mi- riam.   -          .       r "I thank thee, my Lord Joab, for this permission. If it is necessary for the good of our country that Benaiah should die, he will know how to meet his end as a brave and hon- orable soldier." Miriam, in this touch of heroism, unwittingly deceived herself, for she secretly hoped that Athaliah would still pre- vail,  8*     178          ATHALIA II But a bitter trial was in store for her, of which she had no  idea. She had not proceeded far from the house on her way to the place of Benaiah's confinement when she met Helem. Though she was closely veiled, he readily recog- nized her. "Well, dear sister, what success?" "Very little, dear Helem. I have, however, gained per- mission from Joab to see Benaiah," and she handed Helem  the precious order. He glanced his eye rapidly over it and exclaimed: "This is everything! This will admit me as well as thee. Benaiah is saved." But, dear brother, it will admit but one of us." "True, and that mwqt be me. Everything depends upon my seeing Benaiah. I have been making the most strenu- ous exertions to attain this object. Miriam, thou hast saved thy lover."                  -i: "Cannot I do this thing as well as thou?" timidly en- quired Miriam. The distressed maiden had buoyed herself up with the fond hope of soon beholding and speaking to Be-  naiah. And now must she defer this? "It would be risking too much," replied Helem. "Dar- ling sister, I feel deeply thy disappointment; but have pa-  tience, and thou shalt soon see Benaiah free."       X "Be it as thou wilt," said Miriam sadly, and she made a strong effort to restrain her feelings. "Tell him to trust in the Lord, for He is our great helper. I shall see him after his trial, if not before." The brother and sister parted, he full of some high resolve which he doubted not would end in success, while she slowy and sadly retraced her steps to her now solitary and indeed desolate home. It was not long before Benaiah and Helem were clasped in a cordial embrace. Helem rapidly explained the diffi-  X culty he had experienced in gaining access to him, and how he had eventually been obliged to make use of an order Mi- riam had gained for herself. "I know, of course, thou art terribly disappointed, Be- naiah, in having me gain access to thee by this order instead of seeing Miriam's sweet face, but thy safety imperatively demanded it. I do not know how long they will allow us to be together, so we must proceed at once to business. Of course thou desirest to be saved?"   TE OATH.          179     "Ah! Helem, to whom can life be dearer than to me? But I fear my career is pretty near its end. And so, dear Miriam gained an order of access to me when thou couldst not. Oh! that I could see her dear face and hear her sweet voice again." "Thou shalt hear her sweet voice call thee husband, if thou wilt heed me." "Oh, Helem, do not raise false hopes in me that may never . be realized. I have been thinking all night of what my dar- ling Miriam told me of the bright hereafter, for those who thought more of duty here than pleasure. I fell asleep near morning and dreamed--" "( But, Benaiah, listen to me. They have shut thee up so close here that thou hast had no chance to act. But out of this place thy friends are straining every nerve for thy deliverance. Their plans may or may not fail. Mine will not. But nearly everything depends on thy firmness at the trial. Thou must live to save Miriam from a life of sorrow." "' Helem, is there a chance of life for me?" "A chance? a certainty, if thou wilt only be true to thy- self." "What, then, must I do?" "Hast thou confidence in me?" "Helem, I would trust thee with more than life." "Yes, yes, but I mean confidence in my ability to perfect a purpose?" ( Yes, when thou art in real earnest." "Am I in earnest about this?" "Dear Helem, how canst thou ask me?" ("Wilt thou be governed by me, without my explaining to thee the reasons of my requests?" "I will; there is my hand on it. Thou wouldst counsel nothing unworthy a soldier, and a true descendant of our father Abraham." "But wilt thou be offended if I require thee to take an oath that thou wilt not oppose my plan of action at the trial, and only speak in answer to questions put thee by the Judge?" Before Benaiah could frame a reply to the request, the- steps of the guard were heard approaching the door. "Quick, quick; Benaiah, our interview is at an end, Swear!"     JlC V         Bl'lAMHLLA.             i The perspiration started out on Helem's face in large drops, so intense was his earnestness. Benaiah could not resist so fervent an appeal. Lifting his hand, he answered: "As the Lord liveth, I will keep silence as thou hast said." Just then an officer of the guards entered. In stern tones he said: "'The order for admittance was given by my lord Joab to a woman. I arrest thee in the King's  name for gaining admission against orders." Helem turned and confronted the officer. "Helem, is it thou? Not a word! Escape from this place as soon as possible. Recollect thou wert gone before  I entered, if they should chance to arrest thee after this." Helem knew enough of the strict discipline maintained  by Joab, and the danger he had in consequence incurred,  not to need a second warning, He turned towards Benaiah,  said, "Remember thine oath," looked significantly at the   officer, who was a former comrade in arms, and who had not been present when he entered the prison, and hastened away. His liberty was doubly precious to him now.  Thanks to Helem's friend, the affair was smoothed over, : and he was left unmolested. So he only had cause to con- gratulate himself on the timely interference of the officer, for he had thus been enabled to hurry Benaiah into taking  an oath, which with time for reflection he might have re-  fused to do.  CHAPTER VII. IN PRISON.  AFTER Helem's abrupt and forced departure, Benaiah busied himself in conjecturing how his silence during his trial could possibly result in achieving his deliverance, and he finally came to the conclusion that, as far as he was con- cerned, he would have been much happier in seeing Miriam, and that his condition had not been bettered by the oath that Helem had extorted from him. Then he returned to the subject that had occupied his   IN PRISON.         181 earnest thought the entire morning, and had first come to him in his earliest waking moments. This too was of an oath he had taken by urgent request) which was to be the means of warding off coming danger, just as the oath to Helem promised to save him from the peril already upon him. But there was this difference. In Reuben's plan he had much confidence, for though he did not know how his brother eould deliver him, he could easily conceive there might be a way, while in Helem's case all was shrouded in impenetrable mystery. Besides, his- engagement to Helem could very easily be fulfilled when the time came, and there- fore required no present exertion, but the difficulties that attended every effort to keep the oath he had made to Reu- ben, demanded all his energy of thought to contrive a method to overcome them. He was a prisoner closely guarded, not simply by offended justice, but by keen-eyed jealousy and hate. His communication with the outer world was entirely cut off. In r his brief interview with Helem he had never thought of urging him to send for Reuben, and when days passed and the hopelessness of the task commenced forcing itself on his mind, he bitterly regretted his want of thought in not em- bracing the only opportunity he was ever like to have of sending to Reuben. In the meantime, if his exertion of thought produced no palpable results, it at least kept him from brooding over his troubles in the solitude of his confinement. First, to test what communication he was to be allowed with his friends, he asked the man who waited on him, whose name was Irad, if he could send for some articles he had use for. Irad asked him what they were. On receiving an an- swer, he was told that his wishes would be made known to the proper officer. The next day the articles asked for t were brought to him, but they were not his own, but had   evidently been supplied by his keeper.  "This showed unusual caution," Benaiah reasoned with himself--" no hope in that quarter! Now to study this  man, who is the only living thing that connects me with the world without my prison."   He was not ill-natured; much less brutal; answered Be- naiah's questions with respect when they touched on indiffer- ent matters, but declined to answer with like civility, but     182          ATHALIAH.  much firmness, when they pointed to the event of his arrest and imprisonment. Benaiah soon became convinced that Irad had received vfery distinct orders as to his intercourse with him, and that he possessed no arguments, and he tried both verbal and metallic ones, to induce him to swerve from them even in a small particular. Several days passed, yet he had not made any progress in the furtherance of the object on which his mind was so fully bent. His isolation was so complete that he had not heard a word, since Helem's hurried visit, of what was pas- sing outside of his prison. "This cannot last much longer," whispered Benaiah's brave heart; "I must be tried before I am punished, and it will be strange if I do not find some way of sending to Reu- ben when I have a little more liberty of action than is vouch- safed me now! He heard no voice whispering, " then it may be too late!"  And so, just when the lone prisoner had given up all hope of doing anything until his trial came on, an incident occurred that lent new wings to drooping hope, and promised to crown with ultimate success Benaiah's earnest efforts. The influence that produced this happy change in Be- naiah's prospects, were simply these: Irad, the incorruptible guard, as far as logic and the pre- cious metals went, had one assailable point. He was very much in love with the sprightly black-eyed Rachel, and perhaps all the more so as his love was unrequited. Igno- rant, however, of the near relation in which the prisoner and Rachel's mistress stood to each other, he was still be- yond the power of temptation, and might have endured in his integrity to the end; when Rachel, ever active in her endeav- ors to bring comfort to the heart of Miriam, by seeking the safety of her lover, discovered that Irad was his jailer. To   her, it was like the finding of precious spoil. If her arguments and entreaties should prove powerless, she was even equal to the sacrifice of giving her hand to this man for the sake of her beloved mistress, and such a price she argued, would quickly unloose the prison bars. Great as her hopes, was her disappointment, when, after making known her requirements, she was told that their granting was simply impossible. Irad, with rare honesty,   IN PRISON.         183 did not exaggerate his importance, buit told Rachel how closely the prisoner was guarded, and that he was only a servant employed to carry in Benaiah's meals, and was him- self keenly watched. Rachel found she had been leaning on a broken reed; still there might be some little use in it. Miriam would deem it a privilege to send a written message of love to Benaiah; but here, again, another repulse!--so strict were the precautions taken, that Irad was searched before enter- ing Benaiah's cell. Rachel, with something like scorn, was about giving up Irad as useless, when he quietly reminded her that he could take a verbal message, and that, whereas any attempt to take a written one would result in his destruction if he were discovered, that no such risk would attach to one by word of mouth, and that it were better to have one about Benaiah who felt sympathy for him than a person utterly indifferent to his comfrt. Rachel saw the truth of Irad's words, and accepted his offer, but for so little she could only hold out little encouragement It was the fifth day of Benaiah's imprisonment. Irad had brought in the noonday meal, but the prisoner, ignorant of the rich treasure which he carried beside, scarcely heeded his approach, till a gesture from Irad, which seemed signifi- cant, caused him to approach the table. In tones then that could not be heard without, and with a manner that would have created no suspicion even if watching eyes had been on him, Irad told Benaiah the ten- der, loving message sent him by Miriam through the inter- vention of Rachel. With an eagerness that Irad warned him to suppress, Be- naiah plied him with questions as to the circumstances that had led to the transmission of this heart-cheering message. Irad answered, and Benaiah soon discovered that love, which prompted the message, had also furnished it with wings to enter his prison. With less reluctance, then, he   i entrusted his answer to Irad, as to one who could appre- ciate his feelings. Notwithstanding this bond of sympathy between them, Benaiah resolved to take advantage of Irad's weak point, and through it carry out the project that had so occupied his mind and heart during his confinement. t     He asked him plainly if he would send a message for him to his brother Reuben, containing intelligence of his arrest and imprisonment. Irad replied, that the risk of discovery would be too great, and he quietly refused the request. Benaiah then went to the root of the matter at once, and told Irad in as few words as possible, that if he ever ex- pected to win the love of Rachel, it must be by deeds, not mere protestations of devotion; and that he could do noth- ing that would so effectually win her approval, as to labor for the liberation of her mistress's lover. He spoke of Rach- el s love for Miriam, as so great that it almost verged on adoration, and that one word in his favor from her beloved mistress would have more weight with the serving-maid  than all the vows he had ever uttered. Irad felt the force of Benaiah's words, and consented to send the message, but insisted that the directions should be given on his next visit to the cell, as the usual time for stay- ing with the prisoner had expired, and he feared more than ever now to excite any suspicion in the minds of others. No time was lost, for during the afternoon Irad had fixed upon the person he purposed sending, and had even commenced making arrangements for the journey. When he took to Benaiah his evening meal, he found him pre- pared to give directions, which comprised all the details necessary to ensure a successful issue to the project. The messenger, whose name was Joel, was to start the next morning. He was an intimate friend of Irad, who vouched for his fidelity and discretion. He had accepted the mission with alacrity. No difficulty had been found in procuring all the necessary appliances for the journey, and so wisely had everything been done, that Irad was sure no suspicion would ever attach to him for complicity in the affair. Joel, mounted on a mule as being fleeter than an ass, left Jerusalem early for the mountains of Naphtali. Irad had witnessed his departure, and had informed Benaiah of it. "Whatever comes of it," thought the prisoner, "it is a satisfaction to me to think that I have not sat down with folded hands, but have done what I could for my deliver- ance." To return to Joel. After proceeding northerly for a few   THE TRIAL.          185 miles, he turned into a road running towards the great sea. Pursuing this a certain distance he again diverges, this time toward the south. His destination was Egypt. He had long been desirous of making that country his place of so- journ, but had never found means, till now, of accomplish- ing his object. With the means that had been placed at his disposal, it was quite as easy to journey south, as north. To have gone in the other direction might have been of much benefit to the man who had furnished his outfit, but to journey as he was doing, was vastly conducive to his own pleasure and advantage. "Ah! I shall see grand and beautiful Egypt at last!" was his exultant thought. "It shall be my home; there will I get great gain!" After he had once turned his back on the mountains of Naphtali, it mattered little to Benaiah where else he went; still, it may be gratifying to know that he never reached the goal of his covetous desires. He fell into the hands of the Philistines, who confiscated the mule, stripped him of his possessions, and only granted him the boon. of a miserable existence, at the price of a degrading servitude. CHAPTER VIII. THE TRIAL. TEOUGH the time between the arrest and trial was so brief, yet the news had spread through the city with such rapidity that it formed the general topic of comment and conversation. The circumstances of the case would natu- rally attract attention. To such an exciteable and impulsive people, to such lovers of the romantic, this story of love and carnage, so wonderfully commingled, of treason being so strangely born of brotherly affection, could not but prove of strong interest. The sympathy in his favor was almost universal, but ex- cept among Benaiah's particular friends it led to no action in his behalf. The death penalty was so frequently and easily enforced, even in their civil courts, that they looked   186         ATHALIAH. upon Benaiah's case as utterly hopeless, being in the hands of the military power headed by a man of Joab's propensi. ties. A soldier's life after all was but loosely held, and to die like this was better than to be cut down by some heathen foe and hardly ever to be spoken of afterwards. Benaiah's judges consisted of officers in the army who, with but an exception of one or two, were his superiors in rank. Joab presided, which was regarded as an act of great condescension by all but Benaiah and Helem, who boded no comfort from the fact. Miriam was not present. She had relinquished her inten- tion of going, by the urgent entreaties of Helem, who rea- soned that she could do no possible good, and would very likly unman Benaiah. Helem wished Rachel to remain with her mistress, but much to his surprise she stoutly re- sisted, and said it was important she should be present at the % trial. Miriam settled the matter by assuringher brothershe I would be better alone, and that Rachel undoubtedly had  some strong reason for leaving her. Ethni's mother, Rebekah, was present, and fora somewhat  singular reason. Athaliah had cunningly suggested to Ethni that he had better impress his mother with the con- viction that he acted as the accuser of Benaiah from a high- souled patriotism. He had so well succeeded that the poor deceived woman had come there to witness fondly this no- ble championship of her son for his King and country. Had Athaliah's face been unveiled, for she too was present, a smile of savage exultation would have been seen flitting over it as she saw Rebekah enter with Ethni. Benaiah is led in, and a moment after his judges enter, headed by the proud form of Joab. Immediately he mo- tions to one of his military scribes, who in clear and pre- cise tones reads the accusation. At its close he refers to a slip of parchment, and calls upon Ethni to testify against the accused. Ethni gave his testimony clearly and without hesitation. He had noticed a piece of silk attached to an officer's hel- met while he was carrying an order of his lord Joab; that this silk, being of a peculiar pattern, and like what he had once possessed, attracted his particular attention, and he had recognized Benaiah as the wearer of it. This was be- fore the accused had engaged in the conflict. That subse-   THE TRIAL.         187 quently, while bearing another order which carried him close to the conflicting armies, he had again seen this silk-adorned helmet. That on the instant of his again beholding its wearer, he saw him spring forward and dash to the ground two soldiers of the King in order to rescue from a deserved death a traitor, who was then fighting against his annointed sovereign. Two more witnesses were called, who in turn testified that while attacking a soldier in the rebel army they were set on by an officer whose helmet was ornamented iith a piece of silk, the flutter of which distinctly caught their eyes. That they had been overcome by the suddenness and unexpectedness of the attack, but that soon afterwards they had recognized as the wearer of the silk upon his helmet, their captain, Benaiah. Benjamin, much to his dismay, was called, and obliged to testify that two pieces of silk, which seemed to have been parts of a scarf, had been committed to him to take to Je- rusalem, while the city was in the hands of the rebel force, and that he had delivered these pieces of silk to Adin, He- lem's brother, and Reuben, the brother of Benaiah, with di- rections for them to bind them on their helmets in any bat- tle that might take place. That similar pieces would deco- rate the helmets of their respective brothers. Finally, Adin was called, and testified that he had taken no active part in the battle in the wood of Ephraim. When the interview between Miriam and Athaliah is re- called, it is easy to see by what means the conclusive tes- timony of these last two witnesses had been obtained. Joab arose to pronounce sentence. He had merely ex- changed glances with the other judges. To him the case was clear as day, and well it might be, for Athaliah tad told him how she had heard, from Miriam, Benaiah's confession of his error to Helem. Before he had time to open his lips, Helem started to his feet and exclaimed in a very excited manner: "My lord Joab, thou hast not yet heard the defence." "And what defence is there?" sternly demanded Joab. "Simply this, my lord: Benaiah is innocent of this charge. I am the guilty one. Sentence me, not him." Benaiah, in an agitated manner, rose to his feet. His fea- tures, which during the trial had been calm but pale, now  188         ATHALIAH. worked as if in mortal agony. Joab noticed this, and took the nearest way to solve this new difficulty: "Benaiah, I adjure thee to tell me whether this man speaks the truth." Suddenly as that agonized expression had come, so it vanished from Benaiah's face. Calmly and deliberately he answered: "My lord Joab, I confess that on the impulse of the mo- ment, I rescued my brother Reuben from a death which he doubtless deserved as a punishment for taking up arms against his King. Had not my best of friends," and he mo- tioned towards Helem, who was confounded at this easy  overthrow of his pet plan for Benaiah's safety, " who from the most sacrificing motives, extorted from me an oath that I would maintain a strict silence during this trial unless questioned by my judges, I should ere this have made this public avowal of my error. I have ever been faithful to my King and country, and I am ready to die if their welfare demands it." Joab was no plotter, and whatever feelings of jealousy he might have entertained of Benaiah, which had long ere this inspired him with that prejudice which the young en- sign-bearer had so often experienced, had now vanished; and though he had at first proceeded against him by Athaliah's desire, he now stood up the impartial judge. Benaiah had been guilty of a great breach of discipline, to call it by no harsher name, and he deserved punishment. Joab readily determined he should have it. "Benaiah, I bear thee witness that thou hast been not only a faithful but a valiant warrior. But this cannot atone for an act which might have resulted most disastrously to thy King and country. When thou assailedst the men who were fighting on thy side and under thy command, the con- test was most critical. All our forces were then engaged, while only a portion of Absalom's army had been called into the field. If we had then been repulsed, our cause would have been hopeless. That thy act did not produce such terrible results, is no palliation of thy guilt. Benaiah, son of Azariah of the tribe of Naphtali, thou hast been found guilty of treason. In the name of the King I sentence thee to death! Thy execution will take place on the second day hence at noon!"   THE TRIAL.         189 Of all of Benaiah's friends present, Helem felt the most terribly depressed. His plan had failed. All to him seemed hopeless Benaiah must die. He never fully knew till now how dearly he loved him. Life seemed now to have but one ob ect--to protect and comfort Miriam. Leaving Benaiah to be carried back to prison and make his preparations for death, and Rachel to break the sad in- telligence to her beloved mistress, we will follow Athaliah, who has joined Rebekah in her walk home. Ethni is also with them. "Dost thou not pity this poor Benaiah, Rebekah?" en- quired Athaliah in sad tones. Ethni was surprised at this question put to his mother, and probably Athaliah noticed it, but she judged she had him too much in her power to be over cautious. "He deserves his fate," coldly replied Rebekah. "It is a sad fate to die so young, and simply for an im- pulse of brotherly affection!" "He should have thought more of his King than his rebel brother." "True; but how few of us always do our duty! "When we neglect it, we have no reason to complain of the punishment such neglect brings with it." "Wilt thou not join with me in entreating the King to pardon this poor youth? Thy influence might save him from an untimely death." "No, Athaliah, let justice take its course. I pleadfor no traitors." "Be it so, then. Wilt thou not callin and refresh thy- self?" said Athaliah, for they had reached her residence. "Excuse me I am in haste to reach my home., And the cousins separated, Ethni going with his mother, wondering what could have been Athaliah's motive in thus questioning Rebekah.     19v         ATHALIAH. CHAPTER   IX. THE CONDEMNED. HELEM had ascertained immediately after the trial that free access would be accorded to Benaiah's friends to visit him in prison, Benaiah entertained not a shadow of a hope of pardon, and therefore deliberately counted the hours he had yet to live, and determined to put them to the best use possible. The day before his execution he devoted to a journey to Gibeon in order to make a sin-offering before the Lord in ' the tabernacle reared in that city. David had ever made it a rule that no prisoner adjudged to death, let his crime be what it might, shouldd ever be debarred from the full services of the Mosaic ritual. While he made this journey, attended by a strong guard, which only occupied a few hours, as the distance was only twelve miles, Miriam went to her cousin Bathsheba, the Queen, to prevail on her to intercede with the King, first for pardon, and if that failed, then for a postponement of the  execution of the sentence. But Bathsheba had at cost of a wife's honor raised her- self, if the expression is allowable, from a comparatively low station to the lofty elevation of the King's wife, and, what was much more, had become the mother of the future King; for though custom may sanction a plurality of wives, there never can be a plurality of mothers. Hence the superior influence of the queen-mother in the Hebrew monarchy, further increased by that beautiful sentiment that never ex- onerated a son, even though he wore a crown, from love and duty to his mother. Bathsheba gave a cold negative to her cousin's suit. Since Ahithophel had plaved so disgraceful a part, she thought the less the King heard of her relatives, the better. This repulse of a blood relation rather weakened Miriam's courage, but she determined to appeal personally to the King. She secured a speedy audience. The kind heart of David was much moved by her touching appeals for her lov- er's life. Had he not given his Kingly word on his return to Jerusalem, that none should be put to death? Would he not,( ^^W^^^.    THE CONDEMNED.         191 then, interfere to save this single life which had always been so devoted to him, and was so precious to her?" Had David been King, indeed, he would have granted this moving appeal. But he recollected how lately and how successfully Joab had braved him, and he would not ven- ture to come to an issue with him for a mere life, which, af- ter all, was justly forfeited. With gentle firmness he refused her suit, telling her that, for the welfare of his kingdom, Benaiah must suffer as an ex- ample. She might convey to him his sympathy, for he loved the valiant youth, and it pained him deeply that duty pre- vented him from interfering. Miriam, therefore, returned home sad, almost to broken- heartedness. She -had one firm resolve, however, and si- lenced all further suggestions from Rachel. She determined to trust wholly to the Lord for strength to bear the trial, instead of wasting her remaining energies in efforts her rea- son told her would be unavailing. This brought calmness to her spirits, and when, early on the morning of the fatal day, she visited Benaiah in his prison, to remain with him till he was led forth to death, she met her lover with a strength more than human. The gloomy aspect of the place had its influence on her at first, but she soon overcame it. Her appearance, so an- gelic in its serenity and beauty, had even a more depressing effect upon Benaiah, than the prison had to Miriam. He folded her in his arms. "Oh! Miriam, but for this we might have been so happy!" "Dearest Benaiah!" calmly replied Miriam, "We shall be happier hereafter than we can ever be here." "But we know so little of this hereafter," sadly replied Benaiah.  "It is not death I fear, Miriam, but separation from thee. Thou hast been my life here. How can I have another life without thee?" "Dear Benaiah, do not distract thyself with any such considerations as these. Put thy simple trust in the Lord. "ike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.'  We murmur because we cannot be happy in our own way, when all the time the Lord is pre- paring a still greater happiness for us." There was a patch of sunshine on the floor near where they sat. It had been slowly but surely changing its posi-   192         ATHALIAH. tion, and moving towards the window through which it had entered. By a coincidence, not uncommon when two minds are fixed with more or less intensity upon a common sub- ject, the thought, that just as that gleam of sunshine was stealing towards the window, so Benaiah was moving on to death, occurred to them simultaneously. Their glances met. Tears gushed into Miriam's soft earnest eyes, as she thought of the keen pang of that fatal moment when the life would be leaving Benaiah's body. The thought almost overcame her. Benaiah drew her to his almost bursting heart, in a wild, close embrace. Ah! how often had they sat beside some feathery foun- tain, hands clasped, and talking of the happy future. Now, they sit and watch that piece of sunshine moving so inex-  orably on. Was this the dark awaking from all their bliss-  ful dreams?  After a silence of a few minutes' duration, Benaiah ab- ruptly enquired: "But, Miriam, is there no hope of a pardon, even at the last moment?  "Oh! dearest, do not depend any more on what man can do for thee! think only of God," was the reply, half choked with sobs. "But Adin hinted to me after my return yesterday from Gibeon, that there was a hope even to the last, and that I must be strong and cheerful," "Yes, dear Benaiah," replied Miriam, with sudden anima- tion," there is hope, great hope. Thou must be strong and cheerful. But thy trust must be in the Lord, and our hope must be that hereafter we will meet and live together in a happier world. Believe me, all other trust is in vain. Thou knowest how hard it is for me to think this-how gladly I would catch at anything that would give the least indica- tions of deliverance from this cruel death." "But thou knowest, Miriam, that Adin could have al- luded to no such hope as this." "I fear Adin said that, to give thee a little present comfort, forgetting how terrible is the awakening from a false hope." "Probably he did," firmly replied Benaiah; "and now to face the worst, as a soldier ought. I fear not death, dear Miriam, but it lacerates my heart to think of thy grief, and that I cannot be by to comfort thee."   THE CONDEMNED.         193 "The God of Israel will comfort me, beloved Benaiah; 'He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are but dust.'") Still slowly, yet inexorably glides the patch of sunshine towards the window. Before it leaves the chamber, the guard will come for Benaiah, and as that gleam of light dis- appears, so will the light of the condemned man's life van- ish from earth. Oh! for some Joshua to stay the sun in its course for even one brief hour! In that hour might lie hidden the germ of the poor prisoner's safety, for fast as horse can carry him, a man is hastening towards Jerusalem, carrying in his hand the key that may unfasten Benaiah's prison door, and give him life, freedom, and happiness. But if he comes not soon, the prison will be a tomb-the jailor, death! Useless the hurried, anxious journey then! -no hope left, save in the far off time when the great con- queror shall burst the bars of the sepulchre and vanquish death. There are the sounds of distant footsteps mingling with the measured heavy tread of the sentinel along the corridor. Benaiah starts, for he knows the guard are coming to con- duct him to the place of execution. Miriam feels the shud- der, and raises her head from her lover's breast. Her ear now catches the heavy tramp of mailed men, growing every moment more terribly distinct. The dread moment has at length arrived. She had thght of this time, but how ghost-like were her thoughts, compared to the stern, living reality. Louder and louder grows the clanking tread of the ap- proaching guard. A deathly pallor overspreads the face of Miriam; her lips grow white; there is a choking sensation in her throat, and she gasps out: "Oh! God! Oh! God!" It is the despairing cry of a broken heart, and the Good Father answers it by sending the deep peace of oblivion to the bruised soul of the fair sufferer. As the door opens, Miriam sinks fainting into her lover's arms. The door opens, but the soldiers do not enter. Friends come, instead. Rachel hurries forward and receives her lifeless mistress from Benaiah's arms, after he has im- pressed oi;e last kiss upon her cold, still lips. "Better thus," he murmurs, and then turns calmly to the friends who have come to say a last farewell. No tremor in his 9     194          ATHALIEAH. hand as he extends it, no faltering in voice or step. It is not the holy resignation of the martyr born of faith, but the cold calmness of the soldier, near akin to pride. He has met death face to face too often to falter now. There is a sudden commotion in the circle around him, and Helem, flushed with excitement, breaks through it. "Benaiah! there is some hope yet. As I was hastening here I saw thy brother Reuben, dusty and travel-stained, riding rapidly towards Joab's house. He recognized me, and without reining in his horse, shouted to me, " tell Be- naiah there is hope." A flush flitted over Benaiah's face. He turned and looked upon Miriam. She still lay unconscious in Rachel's arms. A pang seized his heart, like the pain felt by the frozen man won back to life. The hope, the pang, were but mo- mentary. The cold hand of death again numbed his heart. He shook his head and a sick smile lay on his face as he i said:                           "No, Helem, there is no hope left for me. There is only q one thing my best friend can do for me now, " and he whis- pered in Helem's ear, " devote thy life to her." Strong as he felt himself, he could not venture to pronounce that loved name. But Helem took a very different view of the matter. Miriam would have another and better protector. A full, half hour was yet to elapse before the sentence was to be carried out, and before that time a pardon would be granted to his friend. In his eyes, the dashing, dusty impetuosity of Reuben was the very personification of success. The lusty cry, "tell Benaiah there is hope," interpreted itself to his ears, as, " tell Benaiah he need fear nothing." Even when the guard entered, and placing Benaiah in their midst, passed out with him to the place where he was to meet death, Helem still felt no fear, and only looked upon it as an unnecessary labor; they might as well have waited where they were for the order to release the prisoner. Slowly and solemnly the procession wends its way through the streets of Jerusalem. The execution is to take place outside the city walls. At the gate there awaits them a numerous escort, mounted and fully armed. There were rumors of an intended rescue, which the unquiet state of the times, and the popularity of Benaiah, coupled with the   THE LETTER.          195 wide-spread sympathy felt for him, rendered only too proba- ble. Hence the precautions that had been taken. This ru- mor had been first started by Ethni. He had little idea, however, how much foundation there was for it. CHAPTER X. THE LETTER. THE message sent to Reuben by Athaliah reached its des- tination safely, but Reuben was absent from home. Great was Sarah's grief and consternation upon perusing the few lines which told so simply yet terribly the fearful situation of Benaiah. She lost no time in conjiecturing the causes of the danger that threatened her brother-in-law, but bended all her energies to the speedy finding of her husband. Servants were sent in every direction. Reuben had given no intimation of where he was going nor when he would re- turn. Time was wearing away, and the terrible message said " lose no time." On the day before the one in which Benaiah was to suffer death, Reuben returned, little suspect- ing the summons that awaited him. There was but little day-light left, and the first partof the journey to Jerusalem was difficult and dangerous even by day. By night, some of the mountain passes were all but impassable. Nearly one hundred miles were to be traversed. Added to all was the dreadful uncertainty of reaching the city in time, even if the most strenuous exertions were made and the greatest risks incurred. But Reuben was the man of action. A glance at the message was sufficient, for Sarah had placed it in his hands without speaking. He hastily thrust it in his bosom, hur- ried to a small Egyptian cabinet he always carried with- him from one residence to another, opened it and passed his hand into it. A sharp click was heard, and he withdrew his hand bearing in it a folded piece of parchment. Secur- ing this carefully about his person, and meanwhile giving orders for the saddling of his surest footed mule, he was ready in less time than it has taken to write this.     196         ATHALIAH. Three men servants were to accompany him down the mountain, each mounted and leading a mule, in case any ac- cident should occur to the one on which their master rode. The progress during the night was slow and dangerous. In many places a stumble or false step would have precipitated rider and mule down precipices hundreds of feet deep. It was long after the sun rose ere Reuben could avail himself of the fleeter pace of a horse, which he found little difficulty in procuring. He did not reach Jerusalem till within three quarters of an hour of the time fixed for his brother's death. This fact he soon learned. Though the time was so limited, he did not ride straight to Joab's house, but made a detour of several blocks, and finally dismounting, entered a house. He soon re-appeared, however, and one judging by his countenance would have seen that his mission so far had been successful. A few minutes later and he is in the presence of Joab, and now really commences the contest for a human life. Whatever good effect might have resulted from the hur- ried visit Reuben made before seeking Joab, it had pro- duced one serious drawhack. Rizpah, prowling about like some ill-omened bird of prey, had seen Reuben enter and leave the house, and had followed him sufficiently to infer that his next point of destination was Joab. This intelli- gence she hurriedly conveyed to Athaliah. There was no time for preliminaries. The interview opened with a dark frown from Joab, and a haughty, defi- ant look on the part of Reuben. "My lord Joab," commenced Reuben, " my brother Be- naiah is under sentence of death. I come to demand his release." "Thy brother dies in half an hour!" was the derisive re- ply of Joab. "My lord, listen to me for a moment. I do not come single handed. I said, I demanded my brother's release. I ought to have said, I will buy it." "Buy it!" scornfully exclaimed the haughty commander; "not if thou possessedst all the gold of Ophir." "There are things more valuable than gold or jewels," calmly replied Reuben; and then resumed, in a tone of such confidence that it was evident he thought he held his brother's destiny in his own hands.   THE LETTER.          197 "cMy lord Joab, twelve years ago thou wert besieging Rabbah of Ammon. One day King David sent from Jeru salem for Uriah the Hittite, one of his worthies, and if simple hearted valor and fidelity be worthy, the worthiest of them all. He went to Jerusalem and soon returned. So refined and ennobled was his devotion to his King and adopted country, that the trap the King laid for him was powerless to ensnare him. Do not interrupt me, my lord," almost fiercely continued Reuben. "I must speak plainly. The King, after the royal reception he gave Uriah, dismissed him. He returned to the army, bearing his own death war- rant in a letter from the King addressed to thee. I can re- peat it word for word, for it is engraven on my heart in letters of fire: "'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten and die.'" A gloomy, impenetrable expression had been slowly gath- ering on the face of Joab. Reuben had ceased speaking, and seemed lost in a half sad, half angry revery. "Well, what of all this? Thou hast obtained by some means, I know not how, the contents of that letter, and are acquainted with all its accompanying incidents. Such asser- tions, publicly made, are dangerous, unless thou boldest the proofs." "I have the proofs! I know the contents of that letter, because I possess that very letter, written by the King's own hand!" "Then thou stolst it," hurriedly replied Joab. "What, ho! there!" A soldier who was on guard at the door, immediately en- tered. Joab was arrested in his purpose by the cool, mock- ingl smile on the face of Reuben. He had been too pre- cipitate, and to cover as far as possible the effect of his mistake, turned to the sentinel and haughtily commanded hm to admit no one without further orders. The man bowed submissively and withdrew. Reuben was the first to break silence. "That letter, of course, I have not with me. I cannot afford to carry my brother's life so loosely. Spare that brother's life, for I know well thou hast the power to do so, and that letter shall be placed in thy possession. But if he dies, that let-     198         ATHALIAH. ter will be opened and read by the one who now holds it; it will be shown to the prince of every tribe in Israel; its contents will be known through the length and breadth of the land; and then let the Royal adulterer and murderer hold his throne if he can!" Joab saw clearly the threatened danger. He did not doubt but that the cool, determined man before him had spoken the truth. He recollected the terms of that extraor- dinary letter well enough to know that Reuben had given a very accurate recital of it. He knew the letter had disap- peared, but he had thought that he might possibly have de- stroyed so dangerous a document. His loyalty, for Joab was loyal, urged him at once to give up Benaiah for the let- ter, but his haughty spirit revolted at the idea of being thwarted thus, and actually forced into a course of action he was powerless to resist. Reuben seemed to divine something like this. He had preserved that letter for a long time, thinking at some day to make a grand use of it. He had been tempted to use it in Absalom's behalf, but he soon saw that the rebellion needed no such help. When rescued by Benaiah in the battle in the wood of Ephraim, his first thought was of this now precious piece of parchment. This, then, was the use he wanted to make of it, though, at the same time, failing in that, he felt a gloomy satisfaction in the thought that he could so terribly avenge his brother's death. "My lord Joab," said Reuben, with a humility he had not yet shown, "I appeal to you for a single life, and offer for it the peace and perpetuity of the monarchy. As a loyal man, thou canst not refuse me." Joab was evidently about to submit with the best grace he could, for though the struggle had been brief, it was still severe, when voices in altercation were confusedly heard in the corridor. The one, the musical but imperious tones of a woman, the other, the gruff mutterings of the guard. Joab still seemed hesitating, when the door slowly opened, and the sentinel timidly entered the room, closing the door behind him.   THE RING.         199 CHAPTER XL THE RING. COULD a frown kill, the soldier would have fallen dead; for Joab, not in the best of humor, flashed on him a look of dire displeasure. The man seemed to have lost the power of speech, for he held in his extended hand as far from his body as he could reach it, a ring. It was evidently of great value, and very curious workmanship. This senseless, unspeaking thing, produced a singular effect upon the two occupants of the chamber. It dispelled Joab's frown, for in it he saw Athaliah. The effect here was the simple result of a very plain cause. But how ac- count for the effect it produced on Reuben! When the light first fell on it, and was flashed back, multiplied and glorified, he started as one might at an apparition seen in the open street at noon-day. Then his gaze became bewil- dered and dreamy, as if he were in other scenes, witnessing other objects. There was another room, connected with the one in which this conference had been held by an arch, over which fell silken curtains. Reuben saw Joab, as through a mist, con- duct a lady, richly attired but closely veiled, into this inner room. It is scarcely necessary to recount the conversation that here took place. It was another contest for poor Benaiah's life. Joab told his fair companion that perhaps the very safety of the monarchy depended upon the pardon and re- lease of Benaiah. Had Athaliah pursued her usual careful policy, she would have given this contest up. But a spirit of opposition seemed to have got possession of her, and the very magni- tude of the danger resulting from her carrying her point, seemed only to increase her determination. The result of such a conference can be clearly seen. On the one hand a beautiful, fascinating woman; on the other, a stern, bloody- handed, but for that very reason all the more infatuated man. A little taunting raillery at her stern lover for being frightened by one man, no matter how backed up-by men or fiends-a little pouting for so readily disregarding her     200         ATIIALIAH. wishes, a bold suggestion to let the monarchy take care of itself, and if it must go, let it; the people must have a king to rule them-who do it so well as my lord Joab with his Queen Athaliah. But what of the dreamy bewildered man in the next room? Dreamy, bewildered, no longer. Reuben had not risked limb and life, ridden hard for eighteen hours without rest or refreshment, finally to fritter away the moments so rich in results, either good or ill, to his loved brother. He listened and overheard enough to know that unless this woman could be gained over, Benaiah was lost. Could he but gain her ear without exciting too much the anger or jealously of Joab, he might still win the stake for which he was playing so terrible a game. Athaliah, when she saw her point was gained beyond all danger of relapse on the part of Joab, seemed in a hurry to leave him. Reuben had formed his plan. There was a table in the room, on which were writing materials. Has- tily tracing a few words on a small piece of parchment, and taking his position near where he thought Athaliah would pass in leaving the room, he waited. Hardly a moment had elapsed before Athaliah and Joab appeared. He had judged rightly in taking his position, and succeeded in placing the scrip of parchment in her hand without Joab noticing it. She started a little as the parch- ment touched her hand. Curiosity befriended the poor con- demned, for instead of repelling the familiarity of Reuben by withdrawing her hand, or even waiting to see what the action meant, she raised it under her veil to her eyes and read the words written by Reuben. A half smothered laugh of contemptuous derision was the first result. Then she paused as if in thought. Could her face have been seen now, a new light would have been observed stealing into her eyes as if some new truths or new combinations of old ideas were forming themselves in her busy brain. The laugh, though, was truthful. Whatever threat or suggestion those words contained were powerless to affect her. Reuben had made a mistake somewhere. The new light in her eyes seemed now to express some determination. She must have been mad for the last five minutes to play so foolishly with the well-matured purposes of her life. If the words traced by Reuben were powerless   THE RING.         201 as threats, they still conveyed a truth, a link in a chain that had long been wanting, now so singularly found. She approached Joab, and in tones of subdued gentleness, through which vibrated a chord of penitence, she said: "My dear lord Joab, thou wilt not think me capricious, when I say that I wish all I said in yonder room recalled and forgotten. I felt hurt when I found thou hadst decided, or nearly so, to release this Benaiah. Do with him as thou wilt. He certainly is not worth all this talking about." "No," replied the infatuated warrior," just as thou wilt, dear Athaliah. If thou sayest ' death,' he dies; if' life,' he lives." "The safety, or at least the welfare of the King and his family, thou sayest are somewhat dependent on his liv- ing?" "Yes." "Then let him live."                t These last words were the only ones Reuben heard. Athaliah had artfully elevated her voice just enough to have its meaning reach him. Whether she did this out of mere vanity, to show him he had not mistaken the extent of her power, or from some deeper design, it even were need- less now to enquire. A scribe was speedily summoned, to whom Joab dictated the following: "Jerimoth: "Release the prisoner, Benaiah. The King has pardoned him." Joab added the flourish that stood for his nane, and which was easily recognizable by those who had once seen it. Joab then handed this precious missive to Reuben. "Thou wilt give me that letter as soon as thou hast de- livered this."                  ( "As my soul liveth, yes, my lord Joab." Reuben hastened from the house. A fresh horse stood near his jaded one. There was no time to be lost. He vaulted into the saddle of the better horse and dashed away, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left. He had been informed of the place of execution, and thither he di- rected his course, for he judged by this time the guard must have left the prison with Benaiah. As he turned into the street, running directly to the gate through which he was to pass, he saw a sight that checked     202         ATHALIArH. the pulsation of his heart. A sickening, sinking sensation seemed to take possession of him. It was all over. His brother was no more. Yonder the guard were returning, with Jerimoth riding at their head, his helmet thrown back. Had Joab and that woman been merely juggling with him? was this the meaning, the interpretation, of that half smothered laugh? The bargain was for Benaiah's life. That life had been rudely put out. The letter should then pass into other hands than Joab's. When he first caught sight of the returning guard, and identified it as the one who had his brother's execution in charge by the recognition of Jerimoth, he had reined in his horse and sat gloomily awaiting its approach. He was suddenly aroused from his gloomy revely by a shout as of exultation. He raised his eyes and directed them to the centre of the advancing troop, for from thence the shout proceeded. There he saw Helem, and by his side -could he trust his eyes?-Benaiah! walking with head erect, and proud, calm bearing. He hastened to meet them, as if afraid that something might yet occur to snatch his brother from him. To hand the message to Jerimoth, to leap from his horse and seize his brother in a close embrace, was but the work of a mo- ment. The guard now crowded around Benaiah, congratulating him on his escape. Not one of them but that heartily re- joiced at being thus enabled to avoid the duty of putting him to death. While Benaiah, accompanied by Helem, is hastening to find Miriam, and Reuben is seeking the friend he left the all- important letter with that morning, to get it in order to place it in Joab's hand; and while Joab is representing to King David the expediency of pardoning Benaiah, without as much as hinting at the deep reason there is in reality for it, knowing that the King will readily grant the pardon from mere motives of compassion; we will recount the causes that led to this opportune return of the guard with Benaiah. There was very ample foundation for the rumor that a rescue would be attempted, which became only too evident when the guard reached the city gate through which they were to make their exit from Jerusalem.   '      AFTER THE STORM.       203 Notwithstanding the additional escort that awaited them at the gate, Jerimoth, a prudent captain, did not think it good policy to risk an engagement with the well-mounted body of fully armed men that awaited them. These men, as the reader will readily surmise, were under the leadership of Adin, and were selected by him from the malcontents who had so lately followed the fortunes or rather misfortunes of Absalom. Some joined the party for love of Benaiah, some through mere persuasion, or for the excitement of the affair. Jerimoth, as we have seen, turned back, intending to pro- cure heavier reinforcements, and make his next exit by a different gate to a new place of execution. The news of Benaiah's pardon rapidly spread, and Adin was not long in hearing of it. His band quietly dispersed; none of them had been recognized, as they all wore their helmets down; and as Jerimoth refrained from making any noise about the matter, the affair soon blew over, and so no ill effect resulted from Adin's effort to save Benaiah. It was a nice question, though, whether the time gained to the condemned did not save his life. When it was afterwards discussed, for there was a strange fascination, even to Miriam, in talking of it, Helem stoutly held that Reuben would have been just in time. Benaiah was equally divided in grati- tude to Reuben and Adin as his joint preservers. But Mir- iam, pointing solemnly upward, would say, "It was God." CHAPTER XII. AFTER THE STORM. THE faithful Rachel had had Miriam conveyed home, ere she had recovered from the deep swoon into which she had fallen. She had refrained from applying any restoratives, for she tflought the dread awakening would come only too l soon. When Miriam first awoke to consciousness she stared wildly around, as if expecting to see some terrible vision. The sight of the familiar household articles about her, and Rachel by her side, seemed for the moment to reassure her.     204         ATHALIAH. Then she seemed striving to recall something she had for- gotten, and she raised her hand as if to implore silence on her attendant. Her memory gradually regained ascendancy and com- menced its busy work, until at length Miriam's great sorrow arose before her, perfect in every proportion and lineament, filling henceforth with its dark shadow her house of life. Could some angel have whispered to her how speedily that great shadow was to be dispelled, it would have saved her some bitter moment's. She lifted up her bruised heart to the Great Healer and received peace-the peace that ever flows from resignation to God's will. Rachel, keenly alive to whatever was outward and tan- gible, caught the sound of a distant footstep, which she at once recognized as Helem's. Judging that her mistress was better left to herself, and wishing to have what little suspense there was ended, she gently pressed Miriam's hand to her lips in token of her sympathy, and quietly left the room. Helem told her in just so many words, that Benaiah had been pardoned, and she must prepare her mistress to see him. Rachel was proof against ordinary shocks, but this almost overcame her. Benaiah was loveable in himself, but as the beloved of Miriam, he was an object of something like ad- oration to the serving-maid. She recollected how she had failed in preparing Miriam for the announcement of Ahithophel's death; but this was such a labor of love, she felt more confidence in her skill. But, Rachel, what kind of a face is that to take into the presence of a great sorrow? Dost think thou canst carry with thee the sunlight of joy into the darkness of grief, without detection?--that thou canst pass in a moment from dejection into the exuberance of joy, and thy countenance not tell the happy change? Famous preparation! Miriam looked up, saw Rachel re- turning, and seizing upon her, as a desert wanderer dying of thirst would snatch back life in a cup of water, exclaimed: "( Benaiah lives! He has been pardoned! He is here! Let me see him or I shall die!" She who had no hope, only resignation, now has an ex- cess of it. Rachel, alarmed by this sudden outhurst, this   AFTER THE STORM.        205 voracity of the heart, can only call for Helem. Not Helem, but Benaiah enters ; and the next moment Miriam, half faint- ing from excess of joy, is clasped in her lover's arms. Who can picture such a return to life and happiness! To the sufferer, a temporary cessation of pain is Elysium! What would it be, then, if by some miraculous touch he could spring from his bed of agony, right into the balmy air and bright sunshine of heaven, every nerve and muscle and function of the body in free and healthful play, and every avenue to the soul crowded with blissful emotions! Language is alike powerless to describe or express such rapture. Benaiah and Miriam, at the first, exchanged but few words. They seemed content simply to enjoy each other's presence, and to lose themselves in the dreamy bliss of the peaceful calm that had so suddenly succeeded the terrible tempest. "Ah! dear Benaiah, how little we can foretell the direc- tion from which God sends us help in our troubles. There were three lives, every pulsation of which was devoted to thy safety, and yet none of them proved the means of thy deliverance. Adin sought to save thee by force of arms, as thou hast just informed me, but failed, though the time gained was all important. Helem thought to give his life for thine, but only succeeded in proving how deep was his love and devotion for thee and me; while I, the weakest of the three, failed in every point-with Athaliah, who per- haps was powerless to aid us, with Joab, with Bathsheba, and with King David, all of whom refused. Ah! aow de- voutly I wished that Benoni might return to Jerusalem. His influence with the King--" "Benoni!" interrupted Benaiah; " and who is Benoni?" "Have I never spoken of him to thee??" enquired Mi- riam. "No; I have never before heard his name mentioned b]y thee." "Perhaps it is that my knowledge of him seems more like a dream than a reality, that I have never thought of speaking of him." "And yet, dear Miriam, thou hadst such confidence in his pow4x to aid us?" "Yes; for I knew how great was his influence with the King."     206         ATHALIAH. "And that he would exert it in our behalf?" "Ah! yes; he gave many proofs of his interest in me du- ring our brief intercourse." "' Why, darling, I do not see anything visionary about this." "Because, dear Benaiah, thou dost not yet know the cir- cumstances that led to our acquaintance, and how suddenly it terminated. I will tell thee what I know of the good old man. The mystery that shrouds certain actions of his life may never be cleared away." "It is now nearly two years ago," proceeded Miriam, "( that on the anniversary of my mother's death I visited her grave. I had not been long there when a venerable man entered the place of graves with tottering steps, and a man- ner much agitated. He had not come alone. His compan- ion had evidently served him merely as a guide, for after unconcernedly pointing out a particular grave, he left him. The aged mourner advanced towards it with quick but un- steady steps, and falling on his knees, bent over it. My ears soon caught the sound of a sob that seemed as if it might have rent his heart in twain, and by the convulsive shaking of his frame, I knew he was weeping bitterly. It deeply moved me to see such solitary grief in one so aged. After a while he became more composed. He sat by the grave he had wept over, astif lost in revery, for though his face was turned towards me he did not appear to notice me." "As I rose to go, he for the first time seemed aware of my presence. He advanced towards me as if to speak to me, but suddenly turned and retraced his steps to the grave by which he had been sitting. During the remainder of the day I could not drive from my mind th6 impression his touching sorrow had left upon it; and when morning came, my thoughts again reverted to it. I suppose it was the mys- tery of such violent grief springing from the usual placidity of age that so impressed me. At the noon-day meal my father, Ahithophel, brought hpme from the King's palace, where he had spent the morn- ing, a guest. It was the man who had so excited my sym- pathy and curiosity the day before. When he saw me, tears filled his eyes, his frame shook, and in broken tones he murmured, as if in apology for his emotion, ' Oh! so like her.' This called fqr explanation, and in a few moments   AFTER THE STORM.        207 such confidence had been reposed that it seemed as if we had known each other for years." "It is unnecessary, dear Benaiah, that I should relate in detail the conversation that made known to me the sad story of Benoni's life. For the history of his early years, I was indebted to my father, Ahithophel. The hidden springs of sorrow that now assailed him his own words revealed." "Benoni had been one of King Saul's soldiers, and had witnessed the memorable conflict between Goliath of Gath, and David the son of Jesse, who was then but twenty years of age. Five years later this jealousy of the King grew to open hostility against the youthful warrior, and David be- came a wanderer. Benoni, won by his virtues and misfor- tunes, joined David, and faithfully adhered to him till he was firmly established on the throne of Israel. Leaving others to bask in the sunshine of royal favor, he retired to his home near the city of Gibeah, happily reposing from the fatigues and dangers of his past life, ill the bosom of his family, which then consisted of two sons and a daughter. My father heard occasionally from his friend. For. a time all was happiness. Then intelligence came of the -death of the eldest son. Benoni bore himself bravely against this affliction, thanking God for the treasures still left him. A few years passed and there suddenly came news of the death of the second son, with rumors that he had died from some mysterious cause. The household was broken up, and Benoni disappeared. Nearly a score of years after, he returned to Jerusalem. Thus far is what my father Ahitho- phel told me. "Benoni, without even hinting at the cause that had made him an exile from his native country, told me with what object and with what hope he had returned. When' he set out on his wanderings, he left in the city of Jerusalem his daughter Myra. 'She was of thy age, and closely resem- bled thee,' Benoni said to me. 'After I was gone she married. This I chanced to hear when far away. Years passed, and the desire grew stronger each year to visit again my native land. At length I turned my steps homeward. Visi(ons of a happy home beckoned me; but for wife, mot:ler, husband, children, they showed me only a grave- nau rht else, naught else! "After this, Benoni never reverted to his bitter disap-     208         ATHALIAH. pointment. He visited our house nearly every day, but no allusion was ever made by any to what he seemed desirous of concealing. On any other subject he was al- ways ready to converse. His memory was something won- derful, and his power of description such that he showed me scenes which it seemed I actually looked upon, though they may have occurred many years before, or in lands far distant. "My long story, Benaiah, draws to a close. I have not been tiring thee?" "Tiring me, dearest? Ah! no. After my prison life, this seems to me like the peaceful pleasure of the hereafter thou hast taught me, and thy sweet voice the music of the angels."9 A little white hand glided to Benaiah's lips, as if to check their utterance. He kissed it. Miriam resumed her narrative: "A moon passed thus. He had given no hint of leaving Jerusalem, but seemed perfectly content to spend the rest of his days in the royal city. I was happy at the thought. It was so much better for him to end his days surrounded by friends who knew his worth, and King David was fore- most among the number. "One morning, I shall never forget it, he entered our dwelling and met me, not with his usual placid smile, but with features strangely agitated. His words were no less so. "' Miriam, my daughter,' he said, 'I must leave Jerusa- lem-leave my country again! Farewell, and the God of Jacob defend thee! ' "Before I could make answer he had left me, and I have not seen him since. What added to the mystery of this abrupt departure, was the fact that my father had met him on his way to our house, and exchanged salutations with him, and that then he was in his usual spirits." "Perhaps his troubles had shaken his mind;" suggested Benaiah. "Ah! that was hardly possible," replied Miriam, " and if thou hadst known him thou wouldst have thought as I do-that it was something that he had heard or seen Cifter he left my father, that had so changed his purposes."   IN THE DARK.         209 "Why, what could he have heard or seen in the open street that could have influenced him so?" "Who can tell? It is only another mystery added to those which went before. The Lord protect him in his wanderings, and give him peace!" A silence of a few moments succeeded. Benaiah was the first to speak: "I expect my brother Reuben here before the day closes." "I shall be glad to see him, to -thank him for thy deliver- ance. But how happened he to come to Jerusalem in such good time?" "I sent for him." "Thou! And so closely guarded? By what means?" Benaiah told Miriam how he had accomplished his pur- pose. Irad had wisely refrained from trumpeting his good deeds to Rachel, hoping they would reach her in another way. He was not disappointed. Sweetly soothing as were the present moments to the hearts of the lovers so lately tempest tossed, yet, with youth's prodigality, they reached forth and grasped the added glories of the future. The clouds had spent all their fury, and now sustained only the rainbow of promise. They looked beyond this into a clear sky, ever illumined either by sun or stars! CHAPTER XIII. IN THE DARK. ATIHALIA left Joab's house almost as soon as Reuben. She hastened with quickened steps to her home, and imme- diately summoned Rizpah. "Dost know how soon this Reuben will leave Jerusa- lem?  "Not certainly; but not to-day, I imagine. He has just made a long and toilsome journey." "Canst thou find him, so as to convey a message to him?" "Easily. He will doubtless go to Adin's house, where Benaiah is an almost constant visitor. A message, therefore,     210         ATHALIAH. left with Zillah would reach him, as she could find means to deliver it." "Thou knowest of no way more direct?" "None." "No time must be lost; I must see this man as soon as possible. I tremble to' think what might occur, should he happen to see Rebekah. Thou tellst me she wears that ring?" "Yes, the last time I saw her it was on her finger." "Fool! She might better wear a serpent. But here is the message. Place it in Zillah's hands at once, and then return to me here." Athaliah handed Rizpah the message she had written during their late conversation, and after the Arab woman left her, sat for a time plunged in deep thought. Then she arose and paced the room, at one moment with short and rapid steps, then slowly, with her beautiful head slightly bent forward, one arm supporting itself in the drapery about her bosom, the other hanging listlessly by her side. Her eyes, downcast, caught the sparkle of the ring that had attracted Reuben's attention-that had saved Benaiah's life. "Accursed ring!" she muttered, " once so dearly, madly prized; now, doubly hated!--art thou to thwart me at the last?" She tore the rich jewel from her finger, and flung it from her! Rizpah entered. The ring rolled towards her. She picked it up and restored it to her mistress. Athaliah calmly placed it in its old place on her finger. "Thou gavest the message to Zillah?" "Yes." "Had Reuben been there yet?" "No. Benaiah, whom Zillah told me the King at the last moment had pardoned, and Helem, were with Miriam." "Rizpah, for whom dost thou think this Reuben mistook me, this morning, while I was at Joab's house?" "I cannot tell." "For Rebekah!" A low laugh was the reply. "Igwas of course deeply veiled. In order to gain access to Joab, I had to send in this ring. Reuben saw it. In a   'IN THE DARK.        2" private interview with Joab I found that, in consequence of some mysterious power Benaiah's brother possessed, Joab was actually about to release Benaiah. This purpose I speedily overcame. On my way through the outer apart- ment where Reuben had been left, he managed very dexter- ously to slip in my hand a scrap of parchment! Upon reading it under my veil, I found that by the sight of the ring he judged me to be Rebekah, and threatened the ex- posure of that secret which we have thought was only known to Rebekah and ourselves, unless his brother were released." Rizpah started. "He cannot know the whole secret!" He knows enough to precipitate affairs and deprive us of the benefit of all our planning and plotting. Where can this mysterious man have gained such power? He changes Joab's purposes, and then mine, by different but equally powerful agencies!" "If he has mistaken thee for Rebekah, and should make any enquiries, he will discover his mistake. Nlo one would ever accuse the righteous Rebekah of seeking an interview with Joab." "Thou mistakest my meaning, Rizpah. When Reuben, about a score of vears ago, saw Rebekah's ring, which is the exact likeness of mine, how or where we know not, I do not believe he saw her face, no more than he did mine to- day. Reuben has probably often heard of Rebekah-may- hap knows her. It is not likely he connects her with the secret." "What are thy plans? May I know them?" "Yes. I will see this man and boldly avow myself the wo- man who wore the ring so many years ago, which he al- ready believes, and make him swear to me, that as I saved hs brother he will never divulge my secret in any way, and endeavor to draw from him the details of the secret he possesses. Rizpah, thou wert not as cunning, then, as thou thoughtst thyself." "I could not be in all places at once, and Rebekah must have been imprudent,' was the discontented reply of Rizpah. "I would be alone now, Rizpah," said Athaliah, in kindly tones; " let me know the instant Reuben arrives, for I must not be taken unawares."     212          ATHALIAII. Rizpah bowed assent to these orders, and left the apart- ment. To return to Reuben. After delivering the letter into Joab's hands, he had retraced his steps to the house of his friend, and, after partaking of some food, and requesting to be called at a certain hour, had thrown himself on a couch, and in a few minutes was sunk in profound sleep. Pursuant to a promise he had made his brother in their hurried meeting in the street, at the moment of Benaiah's release, Reuben now repaired to Adin's house. This was his first meeting with Miriam. He found Benaiah and Miriam, as we left them, not only en- joying the pleasure of the passing moment, but filling their future with all that was bright and beautiful. His presence, however, seemed to cloud their sunshine, and chill its warmth, although it was far from Reuben's intent to exert any such influence. Benaiah felt restrained, for he was the possessor of that dreadful secret, which he feared in his brother's eyes might embrace in its dark shadow of shame even Miriam. She was happily ignorant of all this, and simply attributed Benaiah's safety to the clemency of the King; but still she naturally felt embarrassed in this first interview with the brother, who seemed the father, of her lover. Miriam, timidly but with warmth, thanked Reuben for saving her lover's life. To her surprise, Benaiah did not join her in this, and Reuben almost seemed to repulse her gratitude. Benaiah did not doubt as to the means his brother used to effect his release, though he was ignorant of Reuben's possession of the letter, and of course knew noth- ing of the affair of the ring. He knew his brother's mind and heart must be full of the bitter and angry memories of the past, and his only aim in Miriam's presence was to en- deavor to turn Reuben's thoughts in some other channel. So he led him to speak of his mountain home, plied him with enquiries about Sarah, asked about this and that one who had been old servants when he was a child. This only partially succeeded. Brief questioning, with as brief reply, is not conversation. It may be instructive intercourse, but there is nothing suggestive or enlivening in it. It was not long before Reuben arose to go, and lo! the ice suddenly melts. Among friends, the parting mo- ments are ever the tenderest.   IN THE DARK.         213 "( Benaiah, I must be on my way. I leave Jerusalem to- night, so as to have day-light among the mountains." "Return so soon?" exclaimed Benaiah. "Yes, I have nothing to keep me in the city, save your happiness," Reuben added, after a little pause, " and that will thrive without me. But, my dear brother, promise me again, that if any danger threatens thee, thou wilt instantly send for me. And, Miriam, see that he keeps this promise better than the last." "Reuben, I sent for thee!" exclaimed the astonished Benaiah. "Surely, my messenger reached thee?" "If this was thy message, he did; but why use so much mystery?" replied Reuben, taking from the folds of his garment a piece of parchment, which he placed in his broth- er's hands. Benaiah, in tones of great surprise, read it aloud, as fol- lows: "REUBEN : Thy brother Benaiah has been arrested, and is in great danger. Lose no time in seeking him in Jerusa- lem.                  A FRIEND.." 1"This was not the message I sent!" exclaimed Benaiah. "Mine went by the hand of a man named Joel." "This was the only one I received." 'u A friend, indeed, has the writer of this proved to me! Who can it be that does me such good by stealth." "It looks like a woman's writing," said Miriam. "The characters, though large, are delicately traced." "May we keep this, Reuben?" enquired Benaiah, c it may prove the means of discovering to whom I am so largely in- debted for my life. By some mischance my messenger did not reach thee, and but for this little piece of parchment, that told thee of my danger, all would have been over with me by this time." "Keep it, and let it remind thee of the promise thou art yet to make, that thou wilt send for me by a surer messen- ger than thy last, whenever danger threatens thee." "As my soul liveth, I will, my dear brother," replied Be- naiah. "The Lord bless you, Benaiah and Miriam, and ever have you in His holy keeping." Reuben placed his strong hands on the bowed heads of the happy lovers. Though but a brother, in age and foster-     214          trHATH L ing care he occupied the father's place; and this blessing,  so feelingly uttered, seemed to have the sanction of the pa- ternal benediction. Did Reuben think that the very hand pressed on the   E beautiful head of the tender and loving Miriam had once   been dipped in the life blood of the murdered Uriah, to add  solemnity to the terrible oath he had then taken, to execute i vengeance on the murderers of his friend? That hand now  ; blesses the cousin of the woman who was the direct means of the noble Uriah's death!  It might have been an afterthought, but surely no such idea existed in his mind now. The safety and happiness of his beloved brother filled his heart with emotions that ut- terly excluded all feelings of bitterness or revenge. A few hours before this parting, while Reuben was re- covering his exhausted energies in deep repose, and while ' Benaiah and Miriam were waking from the horrible visions  i that had assailed them, and were enjoying the first raptur- ] ous sensations of morning's balmy air, and heaven's light, a woman approached the house that sheltered them. With stealthy tread she enters, unseen, and glides through rooms and corridors, with a dexterity in avoiding observation that shows not only her perfect knowledge of the dwelling but of the habits of its inmates. Soon she reaches a room which has one occupant, Zillah. A piece of needle-work lies neg- lected on her lap, and her eyes are downcast, as if she were in deep thought. Rizpah watches her for a moment before making her-presence known, and then speaks in low tones: "Zillah! dreaming again?" "Thou here, mother?" exclaimed Zillah, starting to her feet. "What if thou shouldst be discovered? Are not my troubles great enough already, but that thou must add to them by incurring the risk of exposure?" "Have I ever been discovered yet, Zillah?" "No; but thou hast heretofore given me some token of thy coming, and I have met thee in a safer place than this room." "My present object in coming, left me no -time for such  preparation." "Oh! mother!" exclaimed the unhappy maiden, clasp- ing her hands; c am I ever to be delivered from this wretched state of existence?"   IN THE DARK.         215 c"Zillah, thou art mad to talk thus! Thy position in life, thanks to the pains I took to educate thee, is favorable to enjoyment, for thou art fitted for something higher than menial labor. If thou shuttest thine eyes to all thy advan- tages, the fault does not lie at my door." "' And for what end was I thus endowed? Why have I been transferred from household to household, and made to act as thy unwilling spy? Oh! mother! better to have left me in ignorance, nay, better never to have reared me, than subject me to deeds my soul loathes." "Zillah, I have heard all this before though perhaps not quite so forcibly expressed. It is all useless. Be content to make the most of thy lot in life. I have made sacrifices for thee. Obey, then, my commands, and let the guilt, if there be any, rest on my head. Disobey me and I will ex- ert a mother's authority-openly claim thee as my daughter, and we will again take up the wandering life in which thy childhood was passed." Zillah's cheek paled. This conflict with Rizpah, like all preceding ones, ended in the daughter's submission. She knew it was no idle threat her mother made, and the thought of being a wanderer appealed so forcibly to her fears, per- haps to her pride, that she yielded to Rizpah's authority. After a few soothing words, with some vague promises, for Rizpah preferred gentle means jo harsh ones, she en- quired: "Who is with Miriam?" "Benaiah." "As I supposed. Has Reuben, Benaiah's brother, been here yet?" "No.)" "He will come before leaving Jerusalem. Thou must manage to place, in his hands this slip of parchment. Thon mayest read it. There is no harm in it, even that thy keen eyes can detect. But, Zillah ; " and Rizpah's tones changed from playful raillery to stern menace, " be sure he has it. Give it to hig as he is leaving the house. There is no need of Benaiah or Miriam knowing where it invites him." "I will do so; but, mother, hereafter give me some token of thy coming, that I may meet thee where there is not so much danger of detection as here." "I have always done so, and will do so again when it is     216         ATHALIAR. possible. Trust to me to take all due precautions. Is there anything thou needest?" "No, no!" hastily replied ZilIall. '"Would that I could decline receiving from my kind and confiding mistress the wages she gives me, thinking me true and faithful to her interests. Oh! mother! assure me again that it is not against her peace thou art plotting, or against any near and dear to her. If harm befall her or them through me, I should die of despair."                       4 "Why, Zillah, these are silly fears! I must sustain my  reputation as the great soothsayer, and how better can I do : so than by an intimate knowledge of the events that trans- pire in the secrecy of the household. Even Ahithophelonce  came to me, and much of the information thou hadst given me of his family I used in convincing him of my power. '  ",Oh! could I believe this were all. But I fear something  far worse." , Again! Zillah " exclaimedRizpah, in angry but subdued tones, "have greater confidence in thy mother's virtue. Dismiss these idle fears. They are vain and foolish, nay, as against thy mother, they are wicked. Remember what I told thee of the message to Reuben. Farewell." Zillah remained for some time absorbed in earnest thought. She recalled the incidents of her past life, and tried to find comfort in the reflection that no evil had ever befallen those in whose houses she had lived, that could have been occa- sioned by her mother's agency. But, try as she would, she could not believe that it was simply for the purpose of increasing her reputation as a soothsayer, that Rizpah forced her to play the spy in the various houses in which she had lived. There was a mys- tery, a depth of purpose, in her mother, that convinced her she had some ulterior object to gain. What that object could be, was the dread question that haunted her sleeping and waking hours. "Oh, it is this uncertainty that binds my hands!" was her thought. "Were I once convinced that evil threatens those who have trusted and befriended me, I would suffer anything rather than longer be made an instrument for such Linked with this thought, without volition of her will, was a recollection of the evening in which she had con-   THE SECRET.         217 ducted Ethni to her mother's dwelling. It may have arisen, because, when ordered by Rizpah to perform this mission, she had resisted, and very much such a scene had ensued as that which had just taken place, and with similar results. Or the cause of this remembrance may have lain deeper hid in the recesses of Zillah's heart. When a member of Rebekah's household, her occupation was to read to her mistress, or write in her presence, and Ethni was very often with his mother. If in despite of reason she had allowed herself to love him, she never acknowledged it, even to her thoughts. If her unruly heart ever whispered it to her, a deeper tinge would suffuse her cheek, though no one was near to note her confusion. Her life had been such, that she deemed it the most miserable infatuation for her to cherish love for the son of Rebekah, even in secret. Her thoughts were, however, often busy, pondering what could possibly be the reason for his going to her mother's house, the evening she had led his steps hitherward; or whether he had ever really loved Miriam, and ff he were much disappointed in Benaiah's successful suit. The scene of the interrupted betrothal often recurred to her. She could not see it as others did. She thought that Ethni had merely performed an officer's duty. After Rizpah's departure she sat for some time in revery, rehearsing the few and meagre incidents connected with Ethni's life, little thinking of the great insight into it she was on the eve of making, or of the stirring events that were to transform her from the dreamer to the worker. CHAPTER XIV. THE SECRET. WHEN Reuben reached the vestibule of the house, a side door opened, and Zillah appeared, holding in her hand the written message of Athaliah. "I was told to give this to the;," she said, in tones so gently sad, that Reuben felt attracted to her. He was, be- sides, in a sympathetic mood. 10     218         ATHALIAH. "By whom?" he gently enquired. "The message will explain itself," Zillah replied, still humbly, still sadly; and she withdrew. Reuben did not at once unloose the silken thread that fastened the letter. He thought of the maiden who had so suddenly appeared, and as suddenly departed. She was evidently unhappy, and yet patiently so. Who was she? Evidently a serving-maid in the house. But with a mis- tress so kind and gentle as Miriam, why should she be un- happy? Then he thought of the message in his hand. "Ah! this will give me some light!" His curiosity to know the contents of the strangely de- livered missive seemed to relate more to the maiden who delivered it, than the one who had written it. A dark expression stole over his face as he read it, and he crushed the parchment in his strong grasp. It was a re- quest from the woman who had saved his brother's life, to grant her an interview. Then followed directions to find her house. It was signed "Athaliah." Reuben muttered: "Has the woman no shame? What can she want with me?" And then his thoughts reverted to Zillah. By what un- happy destiny had her life become linked with this woman, who called herself "Athaliah?" As he walked along the streets, his mind was busied in vain conjectures. He had no clue to proceed by, and so groped wildly in the dark! He never once asked himself why he should feel such sympathy in a mere serving-maid's affairs. If asked, he would have replied, that he pitied her. Abstracted as he was, he took the most direct route to Athaliah's house. Before he entered the fair plotter's pres- ence, she had had time to arrange all the accessories of a proper admission of light, a graceful disposition of drapery, and an attitude, on a pile of rich cushions, which could be made languishing or defiant, as occasion might require. She little dreamed how futile such artifices were against the man who now appeared before her. She acknowledged his presence by gracefully inclining her head, and waved her hand to a seat near her, in token that she wished him to be seated. He had bowed stiffly in answer to her salutation. In an- swer to the wave of her hand, he replied sternly:   THE SECRET.         219 "The interview will be brief. I prefer standing." Athaliah slightly raised herself, and her dark eyes flashed. She forgot herself but for a moment. Her tones were soft and gentle as she replied: "We met this morning in the house of Joab." "Well." "I there saved thy brother's life." "Not till thou hadst freshly endangered it. Hadst thou not come there at all, Joab would have granted my re- quest." "Ah! thou playedst the listener, then?" "My brother's life was at stake, and I heard enough to tell me the object of thy visit." Still, did I not finally save him, and thinkst thou, even if Joab had released him, it would have availed him any- thing? "Well, granted that thou savedst my brother's life  What dost thou require of me?" "Kind words, at least," softly replied Athaliah. Her busy brain was at work, solving the question, of what course had better be pursued with this stern man. He could only have caught the import, or perhaps only guessed it, of her conversation with Joab that morning. Would it be safe to attempt to gain information of the in- cident that had betrayed to him long years ago the secret of which he was possessed. He looked upon her now as a bold, shameless woman. She would try to soften him by a show of sorrowful repentance. It was generally a plant of slow growth, but she would try and force it. She bowed her beautiful head and covered her face with her outspread hands. It was a very pretty figure of grief. "Oh!" she sobbed forth "all are against me! I have wealth, but no friends; beauty, but no love; power, but no peace. Oh! I am so unhappy!" "The wicked are generally so," coldly replied the un- moved Reuben. Oh  Reuben! Couldst thou have seen the flash in those eyes, couldst thou have heard the vows of vengeance regis- tered in the dire hate of that revengeful heart, warrior as thou art, thou wouldst have quailed, at least for a moment, beneath it. Athaliah had a' fine opportunity to recover herself, and     220         ATHALIAH. never had she needed it so much. Her rage was so intense that she had been on the point of throwing off her mask and flashing on him all the anger and scorn of which she was capable. But she would do better than this! It was the first time that this beautiful sorceress in men's passions had met such an antagonist as this. When she raised her head, her expression was calm, sad, touching, beautiful. It was Zillah's expression, only-intensi- fied in its placidity, sadness, and beauty. But it found no responsive thrill in Reuben's heart. Brave and simple na- tures like his, appear to have instincts to shield them from hypocrisy. Athaliah seemed to have determined to venture further, notwithstanding her repulse, or rather in consequence of it. She would not acknowledge herself defeated. "Hast thou ever seen me since that unfortunate meeting in the mountains of Naphtali, so many years ago?" "Never." "And thou wouldst not have recognized me this morn- ing, hadst thou not seen this ring?" and Athaliah held up her hand, on which sparkled the rare jewel "No." "Thy recollection of this bauble must be very lasting;" pursued Athaliah, carefully feeling her way. "Thou forgetst," replied Reuben sternly, almost fiercely, "what powerful reason I have for remembering it." "I forget nothing; would I could ;" replied Athaliah, with a sigh. '; Say, rather," exclaimed Reuben, in stern tones, "'that thou wouldst the act had never been perpetrated, which gave birth to such recollections!" "And yet thou never trackedst me to denounce me, or if thou didst, thou provedst unsuccessful." "Others, more interested than I was, pursued thee." "Others!" exclaimed Athaliah, but half-concealing her surprise at this mystery, which only grew the deeper the further she pursued her enquiries; " and do they pursue me still?" 1 "No!" fiercely rejoined Reuben; " they died violent deaths, as thou doubtless well klnowest." c"And thou alone, then, art the possessor of my dreadful secret?"   THE SECRET.         221 "I and the God above us, who will yet avenge the inno- cent." "And for the service I have done thy brother, thou wilt swear never to divulge it?" ' Thou needst not fear me. I leave Jerusalem, perhaps, never to return. If this were thy object in sending for me, thou mightst better have mentioned it at once; it would have saved time." Reuben turned to leave the apartment. "' Stay! one moment!" exclaimed Athaliah, now thor- oughly in earnest. What was the power she held over Rebekah, compared to the terrible, and, to her, mysterious secret in this man's keeping. Oh! if she could but have torn it from him with his life, how gladly she would have done it, there and then. Must this secret escape her? Had this man no weak point she could successfully assail? Was he all rock? He evidently loved his brother, strongly and tenderly. She had failed in this point once, but in her desperation she would try it again. "I am not the enemy of thy brother thou thinkest me. It was I that summoned thee to Jerusalem, to save him. If I were openly opposed, to him, governed by circumstances beyond my control, I was still secretly striving to avert from him the danger that threatened him." ' Reuben recollected, now, that the writing of the two mes- sages he had received were exactly similar; but he was not de- ceived by the artful words of Athaliah. "Thou -couldst not have known the power I possessed to aid him. 'Thou hadst other reasons for wishing my pres- ence here; perhaps to testify against him." Foiled again! Should she disavow her connection with the crime of which Reuben deemed her guilty; and prove Re- bekah to  be the woman he called "infamous?"  That would be too precipitate. Besides, her enmity to his brother proved a wall between them, too strong to be ever broken down. No; he must go, and carry his secret with him. Hold! Could it be possible that. Rizpah shared with Reu- ben this mystery, and had kept it from her? There was hope, after all, that this secret would not die with the man that had so humbled and derided her; for die he should, soon and violently. She would find means to accomplish her revengeful purpose.     222         ATHALIAH. "Leave me," said Athaliah, not imperiously, but sorrow- fully. "Thou seemst determined to think all ill of me." "If there be sin in this," replied Reuben, " let it rest on the head of the one whose infamous deeds give occasion for the thoughts." Reuben had scarcely left the apartment, when Athaliah summoned Rizpah by a peculiar and preconcerted signal. The Arab woman was a long time answering it, considering her close proximity to the room. Not a word, not a gesture, not a look, in the late interview between Reuben and Atha- liah had escaped her. CHAPTER XV. A VAIN SEARCH. THERE was much of kind cordiality in the tones in which Athaliah bade Rizpah to be seated near her. "Rizpah, I have been utterly unable to glean any intelli- gence from this man, Reuben." "Thou dost not often fail in thy endeavors," was the discreet answer of the Arab woman. "True ;- but I made a complete failure this time. He is a strange man. Dost thou know much of him?" Athaliah accompanied this enquiry with a glance towards Rizpah, not intent enough to excite suspicion, but which took in every feature, ready to detect the slightest change in expression. "Not much, and that of little consequence," was Rizpah's unmoved reply. "Didst thou not meet him in that famous adventure of thine and Rebekah's in the mountains of Naphtali?" Again, that quick but quiet glance! "I think not;" replied Rizpah in a half-musing tone. "He might have been in the King's service at that time. I know he was some few years later." "And he has continued in that service ever since?" "As far as I know, till the late rebellion." Athaliah remained silent for a few moments, as if plunged   A VAIN SEARCH.        223 in thought. Then, with a certain abruptness, and turning her face full towards her companion, she said: "Rizpah, thou hast ever found me a firm friend?" "Ever a kind and honored mistress," replied the Arab woman, inclining her head. 4 No, no, Rizpah; ' mistress' is not the proper term. If I ever assume anything like superiority, thou knowest it is only for the better furtherance of our plans. We are friends and allies." Athaliah extended her hand to Rizpah, who, instead of receiving it as a token of equality and amity, bowed over it as she reverently pressed it to her lips. "Thou art very kind to speak thus. Still I am thy ser- vant, and as ready to serve thee in other matters as in that in which we have a common interest." "Ah! Rizpah! thou well knowest that I have no other object in life but that one which we have been steadily pursuing for so many years. As my ally in that, thou canst be naught but my friend, my equal." "Thine equal! generous Athaliah! Thou art rich, beauti- ful, powerful, for Joab is thy slave; while I am a poor, despised Arab woman!" "No matter; wealth, beauty and power are only so many stepping-stones to that one object of my life, in which thou art aiding me so efficiently. But, Rizpah, rethinks thou hast not so much confidence in my power as I could wish." Rizpah regarded Athaliah with a fixed look of surprise, without speaking. "Come, come, Rizpah," proceeded Athaliah, in laughing tones; "that look of innocent surprise is well assumed;" and then, in grave but kindly tones, added, " surely I have given thee proofs enough of my power and discretion to be fully trusted." "Thou must explain tiqself, for, as my soul liveth, I do not understand thee," was the earnest reply of Rizpah. "Easily done, Rizpah. Thou hast told me much of Re- bekah, but not all. Thou hast kept back a secret tenfold darker than the one revealed by thee when first we became sworn allies in our work of vengeance. "As the Lord liveth-" "Hold! Rizpah. That is at the best but a poor oath from thy lips. I know one worth ten of it."     224         ATHALIATH. "Name it, and I will solemnly take it, that I have re- vealed all and everything I know of Rebekah's past crimes." "Swear, then, by thy Mother's Grave." A flush deepened the swarthy countenance of the Arab woman, a tear softened the hard glitter of her dark eye, and her tones were tremulous as she repeated the prescribed oath. Scarcely had this oath, so feelingly and solemnly uttered,  escaped her lips, when a sudden change flashed over the countenance of Rizpah. The eye, for a moment softened, now gleamed with the fierce fire of hate. The trembling lips were firmly compressed, and the cheek, which had flushed with the tender memory of a mother's love, paled in this sudden intensity of passion. Short lived, as sudden! in a moment all this had passed away, and Rizpah had assumed her usual immobility of expression. Little as Athaliah understood this marked and sudden change in Rizpah's face, she was still satisfied that the Arab woman had spoken the truth. All she knew of her life, pre- vious to their meeting some years back, was the little told her by Rizpah herself. In this scant history therewas but one personage ever mentioned with feeling, and that one was Rizpah's mother. She gave no particulars of her pa- rent's life, but spoke only of her as the best, the gentlest, the fondest of mothers. Athaliah had turned this little oasis of a dreary, barren life to some account. She had converted it into an oath. It had produced no other satisfaction, however, than to convince her that Reuben's secret, at least as far as she was concerned, must perish with him. Arriving at this conclu- sion she dismissed all other thoughts, save a speedy ven- geance on the man who had so thwarted and insulted her. It was therefore with a glow of savage exultation in her heart that she heard a servant announce that Ethni, the son of Rebekah, wished to see her. Ordering him to be immedi- ately conducted to her, she thoughtfully awaited his ap- proach.   A WOMAN'S VENGEANCE.       225 CHAPTER XVI. A WOMAN'S VENGEANCE. ETHNI had heard of Benaiah's pardon by the King, and had sought this interview with Athaliah, partly from curiosity to learn the cause that had produced this royal clemency, and partly in anger at this failure of their plans; for al- though his infatuation for Athaliah had obscured, if not ob- literated, his love for Miriam, still he was none the less anx- ious to have his rival deprived of the prize he had once so ardently coveted. The cordiality with which Athaliah met him banished all thoughts, either of curiosity or anger, from his mind. Atha- liah was sincere in this warm welcome she gave him, and Ethni felt the potency of this truthfulness. If he could have divined the cause of this eager greeting, how he would have shrank back in scorn and detestation! "Thou hast come to upbraid me, Ethni, for letting this Benaiah escape a merited punishment. Thou wilt forgive me, wilt not, when I say it was not from lack of power on my part, but a fear of pushing that power too far, that de- terred me from fulfilling what seemed to thee so desirable an object?" It was not so much the words, that so powerfully affected the impulsive Ethni, as the tone and manner in which they were uttered. There was so much of affectionate gentle- ness in her entreaty for forgiveness, such thrilling music in the mention of his name, such significant emphasis on the words "so desirable an object," made still more easy of in- terpretation to his hopeful heart by the low sigh that ac- companied them, that Ethni, losing what little control he had over himself, seizedlthe hand extended to him, and cov- ered it with passionate kisses. "Speak no more of Benaiah or Miriam, adored Athaliah; say there is hope of my winning this fair hand, and life has no other object worth pursuing." Athaliah gently but firmly withdrew her hand as she re- plied: "Only to be abandoned when won, for another and a fairer." 10*     226         ATHALIAH. c A fairer does not exist, beautiful Xthaliah. Believe me, I never loved till now-never knew before what love was. Abandon thee! Not till I relinquish life." "Ethni, I do not doubt thee," replied Athaliah, allowing him again to take her hand, " but these are only words, fleeting as the breath that uttered them. They may deceivei thee, even, sincere and earnest as thou art. Deeds, Ethni,  deeds are the true, the only test of the heart's feelings." "Try me by this, by any test, beloved Athaliah," ardently exclaimed Ethni, "I will do and dare anything for thy love."  "But if thou shouldst shrink from the test I offer, it were  better hadt it never been proposed, for I could not think then, as I do now, that thou lovest me."  "As my soul liveth, Athaliah, I will shrink from nothing thou biddest me to do. Be it flood, fire or fiend, I will dare f one, dare all."  Athaliah paused a moment, and fixed upon Ethni a gaze so tender and loving that, in the extravagance of his pas-  sion, he snatched a poniard from his girdle, and placing its  keen glittering point over his heart, exclaimed:    i3 "Beloved of my soul! say but the word, and I will die 0 here at thy feet." "And make myself for ever wretched! No! no, Ethni! 1 put up thy poniard. There is another and a far better use ? thou canst make of it."  Athaliah again paused a moment, as if in hesitation, then Gi hurriedly proceeded, as if taking a final resolve:  "Ethni, I have been this day deeply wronged; most grossly insulted. In this very chamber, a short hour since, Reuben, whose brother I saved, heaped upon me the most opprobrious epithets. He called me wicked, infamous, and accused me of crimes of which I am as guiltless as a babe."' Her flushed cheeks, the rapid heaving of her bosom, the  angry flash in her dark, lustrous eyes, gave to her transcend-  ent beauty something terrible.             J Ethni sprang to his feet, exclaiming: "I will tear his false heart from him!" "Thou wilt, then, be my champion, Ethni?"     i The angry light in Athaliah's beautiful eyes softened to such a look of tender entreaty, her tones were so gently sweet in their expression, that Ethni, completely infatuated, fell on his knees before her.   A WOMAN 8 VENGEANCE.       227 "To the death! sweet idol of my heart!" "To his death, Ethni-not thine; thou must guard that  well for me."  "If needs be, 'twere happiness to die defending thy honor, i beloved Athaliah."  "There must be no need of any such sacrifice, Ethni;     [ Reuben must die a dog's death."                ! "No, dear Athaliah, he is a soldier, and I must meet him   I in open, honorable combat. Never fear the result! thy love  ii will so strengthen my arm, and nerve my soul, that I will overcome this false-hearted traducer of innocence and vir-  tue." "Ethni, listen to me. This man has been a soldier from  his youth. There is no more practiced or expert swords-    : man in the kingdom. If thou meetest him as thou sayest, he will add to the wrongs he has already done me that of  taking from me the only true friend I have." "Athaliah, let me meet him as a soldier and a brave man ought. God will prosper the right cause, as He did when the stripling David overcame the giant Goliath."        .I "The Lord will do no such thing," irreverently replied  Athaliah. "Goliath was careless and wore his helmet up,  and David was an expert slinger. With Reuben, thou must use thy dagger, not thy sword."  Athaliah divined the struggle going on in Ethni's soul.  She justly estimated the nature and extent of her power    il over him.  It was fascination,mnot a well-grounded love, and ' a fascination he could only fully exert when she was pres-i ent to his outward sense. It was, therefore, necessary to B overcome his just scruples by argument, or at least sophism.  "Thou hast spoken of David," proceeded Athaliah, in gentler tones. "King Saul with subtlety required one hun- dred lives as the price of Michal's hand, and David gener-  ously sent two  hundred of the King's enemies to their   ? graves. I, for this hand, only ask one, and ask it in a man- ner that will not endanger thiqe own."              "Oh! Athaliah!   I will give thee five hundred lives, but:i let it be with my  sword. The Philistines, whom David    i slew, were heathens, and enemies to our country." And is not   this Reuben a traitor and an enemy to our country? He toEk an active part in Absalom's rebellion. Ah! Ethni; hadst thou heard the words he uttered here, thou 7       J 1A.1le jf!     228         ATHALIAH. wouldst in thy just indignation have striken him dead at my feet. What matters the mere circumstances of time and place. Joab hesitated not to avenge his brother Asahel on Abner, nor to remove Amasa from his path, in both cases by guile; and at a word from me he would speedily avenge me on this vile man, and ask but a smile for his reward. And I offer thee this." Athaliah placed her hand in Ethni's fevered grasp, well knowing that the victory was won. As he bent his head over it, pressing it to his burning lips, Athaliah darted a look of such ineffable scorn, such malignant hate, upon him, that could he have seen it he would not have believed the evidence of his senses. c"For such a boon!" passionately exclaimed the infatu- ated Ethni, "I would slay all thy enemies, though the King himself were among them." "Ethni, this man is my deadly, my only enemy. I ask his life as a test of thy affection. Give me thy dagger, and I will attach to its handle a remembrancer of me." Ethni handed her the richly ornamented but deadly weapon. She carried it to a small cabinet of rare and curi- ous workmanship. From one of its hidden and secret re- cesses, she took a small olive-wood box, highly polished, and carefully unscrewed the cover, unobserved by Ethni. This box contained a colorless liquid, into which Athaliah dip- ped the point of Ethni's poignard. It dried almost instan- taneously upon the glittering steel, not dimming in the least its brightness. Quickly replacing the box, and snatch- ing up a ribbon of Tyrian purple, she turned towards Ethni, and leisurely affixed it to the weapon she had secretly poi- soned. "And, now, where can I find this dog?" exclaimed Ethni in a strangely excited manner. "I shall neither eat nor sleep till I have earned the right to call thee mine." "Bravely spoken, dear Ethni!" replied Athaliah. "By this time he must have left Jerusalem for his home in the mountains of Naphtali. He is well known there, and thou wilt meet with no difficulty in finding him. And now suc- cess attend thee." As she gave Ethni her hand, the sparkles of the ring that had played so important a part in the exciting events of the day, caught her eye. A gleam of gratified vengeance shot   THE RESCUE.          229 from her eyes as she removed it from her finger. Handing it to Ethni, she said: "Take great care of this ring, Ethni. The moment be- fore thou strikest, hold it before Reuben's eyes. Let him die looking at it." The shades of twilight were fast deepening into night as Ethni left Athaliah's house. Shades deeper than darkest night were settling over the soul of the miserably infatu- ated man, led on by a blind passion to the commission of a crime which must for all time blast the peace and happiness of his life. Stars above were growing into light. Alas! are there no stars in this man's heart to dissipate its gloom -to guide it in the way of truth? The temptress has, thus far, only succeeded in luring him  to intend the crime. That stain, the tears of a sincere repentance will wash out. Comes there no angel to arrest his steps, and turn him from this path of sin ere it be too late? CHAPTER XVII. THE RESCUE. ON leaving Athaliah, Reuben proceeded towards his fiiend's house, intending from there to finally leave Jerusa- lem. He passed along, absorbed in gloomy reflections, when he was suddenly aroused by the furious clatter of horses' feet on the stony pavement, above which arose the shrill piercing screams of a woman. A glance sufficed to show to Reuben the imminent danger of the female, whose cries of terror, more than the sharp rattle of the horses' hoofs, had attracted his attention. In a moment he had placed him- self by her side, though it required no little agility and coolness to thread his way amid the rapidly passing troop of horse. They were now shut in on either side, and could only hope that the riders wou uide their horses so as to clear them. Speedily this hope was rudely dispelled, and to Zillah, whom Reuben had already recognized, appeared the ap- palling vision of sudden death. Directly bearing down     230          ATHALIAH. on them came a horseman riding in a rank, which prevented him from turning either to the right or left. Reuben, bid- ding Zillah to remain on the spot she then occupied, rap- idly advanced in the line of the coming rider. Seizing the horse's bridle, and exerting all, and even more, than his usual strength, for every muscle was strained to its greatest ten- sion in the excitement of the moment, he, by a sudden twist of the horse's head, succeeded in throwing him on his side. Zillah had fallen on her knees, and covering her face with her hands, so as to shut out the coming horror, awaited what she deemed certain destruction. She heard suddenly, above the clatter of the ironed hoofs, the clang of armor, the heavy fall of horses, as riders and animals became min- gled in the dread confusion. Still death came not. She looked up, and saw an island had been formed of prostrate men and horses in the midst of the dangerous rapids, under whose shore was life and safety. The men, being in full armor, were uninjured, as was at- tested by the loud curses they uttered at this catastrophe. Reuben, not waiting for them to discover its cause, hastily withdrew, bearing the half-fainting Zillah in his arms. The vestibule of a neighboring house offered a convenient place of retreat, and on a bench, so placed as to be unobserved by passers by, Reuben placed her whom he had saved from what must have been a terrible death. The house was either unoccupied, or its inmates absent, for no faces ap- peared at the windows to witness the exciting scene which was still transpiring in the street. Zillah soon recovered herself sufficiently to sit up, and, in agitated tones, to fervently thank the preserver of her life. Reuben again felt that strange sympathy which the first sight of the maiden had inspired in him, now greatly increased by the fact that with her he had incurred a great danger. Brave as he was, and habituated as he had been, almost from youth, to fierce hand to hand combats, often on foot contending with mounted men, he still had appreciated the critical situation in which they both had been placed, and was now a partner with her in her joy at their deliver- ance. "I fear I have restored to thee, maiden, only an unhappy life," replied Reuben, to Zillah's expression of thanks; for he was again forcibly struck by that sad expression, which,   THE RESCUE.         231 even in this moment of excitement, did not quite forsake her face. "Would that I could render that life more pleasant." "Thou art very kind. I am of a despised race, but have learned to worship the true God, and Zillah will ever pray for thy happiness and peace." "Nay, Zillah, my life is well-nigh spent, for I have scarcely an object yet to live for; but thou art young, and fair, and should be happy."  "I, too, have no object in life worth living for," sadly re- joined Zillah. "Had yonder death been less appalling in its approach, I could almost have welcomed it." Reuben seated himself by his companion's side, and, gently taking her hand, as a father might have done to a despond- ing daughter, replied: "Zillah, I know not why it is, but I feel, and have felt since first I saw thee, a strange interest and sympathy in thy destiny. I do not ask thy confidence; but tell me, is there no way in which I can serve thee?" "None, none!" "Is there any way in which thy mistress, Miriam, can help thee? A word from me might go far with her." "None, none!" Still that low wail of sad despair; that cut to Reuben's heart like a dagger. "But, Zillah, thou must not yield thus to such despond- ency. Thou tellest me thou art a proselyte to our holy religion. Look up to God. He will exalt the hearts of them who trust His mercy." This was strange counsel for Reuben, the hitherto stern soldier, to give, but he felt its force, and conscience whis- pered, "take it to thyself." Pardon me, my noble preserver," exclaimed Zillah, with deep emotion, "for my seeming lack of confidence. Be- lieve me, I am happier for thy kind sympathy. My life is bound up. I have the wish to rise, but lack the power." "Zillah, I have a mountain home far up and away from the sins and follies and selfishness of cities. Be my wife's guest, until, at least, thou canst somewhat forget the troub- les of thy young life." "A thousand thanks for all thy kindness, but I cannot leave this city, save at the bidding of my mother. Our law says, ' honor thy father and thy mother."'     232          ATHALIAH "Thou hast, then, a mother living, ana near thee? What is her name?" "Rizpah; but do not question me about my history; 9" and a painful expression almost distorted the countenance of Zillah. "Think that the errors of my life are more my mis- fortune than my fault. We may never meet again," sadly continued Zillah, " but I shall never forget thee ; and if thou ever thinkest of me, think of me as of one who owes a debt of gratitude to thee, she would give her life to pay." The sun was fast nearing the western horizon as Zillah arose to depart. The street was again quiet. "I will accompany thee part of the way," said Reuben, loth to separate from her. "Whither goest thou?" "To Athaliah's house," unthinkingly replied Zillah, for her mother had enjoined her to keep her visits there a pro- found secret. Reuben, hurriedly grasping Zillah's arm, drew her back into the vestibule, exclaiming: "Athaliah? Oh! Zillah! beware of that bad woman. How art thou bound to her? She is as dangerous as wicked. Thou must, indeed, be unhappy, if the sunshine of thy life is darkened by her malignant deeds." Zillah regarded Reuben with manifest surprise, which seemed to deprive her of the power of speech. Reuben hur- ried on with an earnestness that lent peculiar power and em- phasis to his words: "Zillah, for thy sake I will reveal to thee crimes that this woman has committed, that will freeze thy soul with horror, rather than have thee make such remediless ship- wreck of thy life as must follow any intercourse with her, or any influence she may acquire over thee." 1' Oh! thou must be mistaken! There may be another Athaliah." "No; the Athaliah I mean sent me a message this day by thee, and I was returning from an interview with the in- famous woman when I rescued thee." "It is the same; but mayest thou not be mistaken? My mother told me thou hadst never seen her till this day," again unthinkingly replied Zillah. But the intense interest of the conversation might well excuse her forgetfulness of her mother's oft-repeated injunctions as to secresy. "I never saw her face till a little while ago, and why   THE RESCUE.         233 God gave so beautiful a face to so foul a soul, I know not; but I knew her, no matter by what means, as the perpetra- tor of atrocities which Satan himself only could have con- ceived, and his right-hand fiend have executed." There was something almost terrible in the emphasis in which these words were uttered. Zillah was completely be- wildered. She could not but believe that Reuben was sin- cere in what he said, but he must be mistaken, and she again affirmed it, though with more timidity than at first. "Zillah, do not allow thyself to be deceived," responded Reuben, with a gentle earnestness that appealed directly to her heart;'"this woman is all I have described her to be, for in the late interview she acknowledged herself the au- thor of the crimes of which I know her to be guilty." Zillah wrung her hands in agony. She could not now but believe that Athaliah was what Reuben had described her. She knew she had often been compelled to act an unworthy part in playing the household spy, but she never dreamed that crime might have grown out of it. Was she, then, herself, entirely guiltless, because she had been kept in the dark as to the ulterior purposes of those who had directed her? She had only received orders from her mother, but she knew her mother often acted by Athaliah's directions. This vagueness and uncertainty added tenfold to the hor- rors of her situation. "What had she done! what had she done!" was the despairing cry of her soul. No answer came, and the silence was appalling. Her expressive countenance told of the agony within, and Reuben again earnestly reit- erated his appeal to her to break loose from this entangle- ment, and gain at least partial forgetfulness, if not peace, in the quiet home in the mountains of Naphtali, where his wife would gladly welcome her. Zillah, in her despair, was about-to yield assent. Miriam's consent could be obtained, and her mother's dispensed with, for her native sagacity told her that no law, human or divine, would enforce obedience to parents in the fulfilment of crime. But, unhappy and miserable as she was, there was one tie that held her to Jerusalem, an infatuation that she could not overcome. Again, then, she sadly declined this haven of peace. "Farewell, Reuben!" She called him by his name now. "I will well remember all thy kindness and thy counsel. I     234          ATHALIAH. will be henceforth more on my guard, and never will Zillah disgrace the generous confidence thou hast reposed in her, or prove herself unworthy of thy sympathy and esteem." Reuben's heart swelled with emotions that seldom dwelt there. His voice was husky as he pronounced the simple word, "farewell." Obeying an impulse he cared not to overcome, he bent over Zillah, and imprinted a pure and fervent kiss upon her upturned brow. As Zillah passed along the street with hurried steps, Reu- ben gazed after her, but with dimmed vision. Tears stood thick in the stern warrior's eyes, and, as soon afterwards he pursued his solitary way back to his mountain home, he could think only of Zillah, see only her retreating form, as she passed hurriedly along the streets of Jerusalem, and wonder why he should feel so keen and tender an interest in this hitherto unknown maiden. CHAPTER XVIII. THE DAWNING OF A NEW LIFE. ZILLAH soon reached the house of Athaliah, and entered, as was her wont, without summoning a servant, or being seen by any of them. There was a certain room where she always met her mother, and thither she proceeded. Owing to the abstraction of mind consequent upon the agitating scene through which she had so recently passed, she missed her way, and found herself in an apartment entirely strange to her. Attempting to retrace her steps, she again made a mistake, and passed through a different door than the one by which she had entered. Pausing to reflect on the best way of extricating herself from her embarrassing position, she heard voices proceed- ing from an adjoining chamber, separated from the one in which she was by silken tapestry. Obeying a mere im- pulse, she noiselessly approached, and in a moment every feeling and energy of her nature was aroused, by hearing Athaliah utter these words: "Ethnic, Reuben must die a dog's death."   THE DAWNING OF A NEW LIFE.      235 From that moment, not -a word escaped her of the entire interview. Nay, more; she contrived, by carefully sepa rating the heavy folds of the tapestry, to witness also what was transpiring in the apartment. Those few words had seemed to infuse a new spirit within her. She was pale as ashes, not through fear, but from the energizing power of a high and firm resolve. The usual listlessness of her manner had left her, seemingly, never to return. At length, in her objectless life had arisen an occasion demanding all the strength and resources of her character, so long dormant, but which nevertheless ex- isted in no ordinary degree. The only two men she loved-the one, with a hopeless passion, and she felt and knew it to be so; the other, as the preserver of her life, that life so precious to her now-- were both in imminent danger: Reuben in peril of life, Ethni in peril of soul. She heard all, she saw all; saw the look of mingled scorn and hate that Athaliah flashed upon the bowed head of Ethni, and thought of Reuben's words. She neither quailed nor shuddered. A  giant's strength had passed into her heart, and she felt she would yet conquer this beautiful but fiendish temptress. She saw, too, what Ethni did not, the poisoning of the dagger, and a momentary sinking of heart assailed her as she thought of him for whom this deadly weapon had been prepared; but the reflection that she would beed and assisted by a higher power, made her strong again.  She had little time to arrange, much less to mature, her plan of action. Ethni, she knew, would hurry on to the ac- complishment of his purpose, in the desperate recklessness of a blind, unholy passion. She must see him, and endea- vor to awaken in him those honorable feelings Athaliah had exorcised. Failing in this, Reuben must be warned, and in no uncertain manner. But in this race for life, could she outstrip Ethni? And if she could, would it not be saving EReuben's life, mayhap, at the expense of Ethni's? To these questions, a voice in her soul answered, "Do thy best and leave results to God."     236         ATHALIAH. CHAPTER XIX. THE STRUGGLE. ZILLAH rightly conjectured that Ethni, no matter how goaded on by a wild and reckless passion, could not under- take a journey of near a hundred miles without some prep- aration, for Athaliah had told him- to seek Reuben at his home in the mountains of Naphtali. She shuddered as she thought how recently she had left Reuben, and of the pos. sibility of his meeting, by chance, Ethni in the streets of Jerusalem. "By chance!"She lifted her soul to Him who ordereth man's goings, and received strength and conso- lation. Great as Ethni's desire might be to avoid seeing his mother, Zillah regarded his going home before starting from Jerusalem as a necessity, and there she determined to fol- low him, and there to seek an interview with him. Having lived in the house, as Rebekah's serving-maid, she was well acquainted with all its parts, and would thus be enabled to present herself to Ethni without his permis- sion, which she well knew would not be granted if sought by the ordinary means. It was, therefore, with the suddenness of an apparition that she appeared before him. Behind her fell the rich crimson drapery, through which she had entered. She had removed the scarf she had worn around her head, and the light, from a hanging lamp of silver, fell softly on her black glossy hair, parted plainly over her pale brow. Her face was illumined more from the light within, than from the light without. Every thought, feeling, passion, was merged in one holy, firm resolve, to save a life--nay, more, to save a soul'! This unity of purpose, this perfect abnegation of self, lent to Zillah a purity and dignity of expression which checked, though it did not entirely obliterate, Ethni's anger at this unexpected intrusion. "Can it be thou, Zillah? Be quick and deliver thy mes- sage, and be gone. I would be alone." "I come with no message, Ethni," quietly replied Zillah. "I come only to save thee." r   THE STRUGGLE.         237 "To save me!" exclaimed the surprised Ethni!"Save me from what?" I "From the commission of a crime which will cause thee to abhor thyself for ever!" was the firm reply. Ethni's brow contracted, and his hand impulsively neared his dagger's hilt, so sunk was he since he had become the slave of an unholy passion. "Cease these riddles!" angrily retorted Ethni, " and ex- plain thyself, or leave me." "Thou art about to seek the life of one who never harmed thee. Oh Ethni! let me implore thee at least to pause and reflect, ere thou madly plungest thyself down this preci- pice, from which thou wilt never be able to raise thyself." A savage, moody expression distorted the countenance of Ethni. "Zillah!" he fiercely exclaimed, " thou hast told too little, or too much. I must know all! Whose life am I about to take?" "Reuben's," was the calm reply. "How knowest thou this?" "It matters not how; the fearful secret is known only to Athaliah, thee and myself." Zillah had judged rightly, that this announcement would tend to calm Ethni. "And wilt thou betray me?" eagerly enquired Ethni. "I will never mention it but to one, and that only when all other means fail." "And who is the one thou meanst?" "Reuben." "Thou wilt swear that thou wilt keep my secret from all others?" "As my soul liveth; and as the Lord liveth, I will," sol- emnly replied Zillah. "Zillah, I will trust thee ; and let me say to thee, if thou tellest this secret to Reuben, thou wilt have to whisper it in a dead man's ear. A fleet horse is now being cpari- soned for me. Relays of mules will carry me up the moun- tains, and ere the sun sets to-morrow, Reuben shall have atoned with life for the wrongs done to one dearer to me than my soul." Zillah did not despair. True, she abandoned all idea of communicating with Reuben; but she had arguments in re-     238         ATHALIAH. serve, which, though she determined should only be used as a last resort, she believed would prove effectual. "Ethni, Reuben never wronged Athaliah, for he never saw her face till this day," "Were an angel from heaven to tell me this, I would not believe him, for Athaliah told me Reuben had deeply wronged her, grossly insulted her, and I tell thee," fiercely exclaimed Ethni, " he shall die, and by my hands." "And hast thou thought of the heavy sorrow this will lay upon thy mother's heart? It may kill her, for I know how dearly she loves thee, and how proud she is of the good name of her only son." Zillah hailed, with feelings of hope, the expression on Ethni's face, which told of the struggle going on within, at this sudden mention of his mother. It was but momentary, for when he again spoke it was with increased bitterness of tone, as if he were determined alike to silence the voice of nature and of conscience. "Zillah, no more of this! I am no longer a child, to be swayed by such considerations." "Her love and pride in thee are greater now, than when thou wert a child; and, as a man, thou ought to be tenderer of thy mother's peace and happiness than ever before," re- plied Zillah, making another effort before she finally ap- pealed to other and less noble feelings. "Zillah, I will hear no more. It is idle for thee to remain, for thou canst not turn me from my fixed purpose." "Hear me one moment longer, Ethni," firmly replied Zillah. "What if I can prove to thee that Athaliah is utterly unworthy of thee, and is using thee only as a tool for her  unholy revenge, only to be cast aside when thou art no Ion- ger needful." Ethni's dark eyes flashed, as he retorted through his set teeth:  "Zillah, beware how thou accusest thus falsely one dearer to me than life." "I make no false accusations, Ethni. Listen to me calmly. Thou askedst me, a few moments since, how I became pos- sessed of this fearful secret. I will tell thee now, for ne- cessity compels me." Ethni's curiosity was aroused, and he regarded his com- panion with attention. A blush flitted over the ingenuous   THE STRUGGLE.        239 features of the maiden, not for herself, for she was all for- gotten in her intensity of purpose, but for the man who was now to learn that his late interview with Athaliah had had an observer. "A short time since" proceeded Zillah, "I went to Athaliah's house, by appointment of my mother. By mis- take, I entered the apartment adjoining the one in which were thou and Athaliah, and while considering which way to turn, I overheard the words: 'Ethni, Reuben must die a dog's death! I well knew what Reuben she meant. He had just saved me from the terrible death of being trampled by horses in the street. Knowing my connexion with Athaliah, he bade me beware of her." "Let him look to himself!" fiercely exclaimed Ethni; and then, his thoughts reverting to Zillah's recital, he added: "And so thou playedst the listener?" "I did," replied Zillah. "In gratitude to the preserver of my life, and to save thee, I could not do otherwise. When thou bendst over the hand she offered thee, as the price of murder, and when she thought no eye was upon her, she darted on thy bowed head such a look of envenomed hate that I shuddered at the sight." "That look was not for me, but for the man that had so  deeply wronged her." "Oh! Ethni! do not be so deceived. That malignant look was for thee; the poisoned dagger was for Reuben." "The poisoned dagger! What meanest thou?" ex- claimed Ethni. "That Athaliah, when she took thy poniard to affix to it what she termed a remembrancer of her, Secretly poisoned its point." "Impossible!" exclaimed Ethni, drawing his dagger from its sheath and looking at it. "This weapon, with the ex-  ception of this piece of silk attached to its hilt, is just the  same as when I gave it to her." "Thou canst easily prove the truth of my assertion," re- plied Zillah, pointing to a golden cage which contained a raven. This unclean bird had been a gift from Athaliah, who well knew that it would annoy the strict Rebekah to have it in the house. Rizpah, who had been its original possessor,  had taught it to say Athaliah," and Ethni prized it ac- cordingly. Zillah had no compunction in instigating its     240         ATHALIAH.            '  death. What was that, compared to the great object she was striving so ardently to attain. Ethni approached the cage, dagger in hand. His foot- steps awakened the bird, which, seeing its master, hopped lightly from its perch, and thrusting its head through the bars of its prison, croaked "Athaliah." Some delicate morsel was generally the reward for this vocalism. This time, however, it received a slight puncture from the point of Ethni's dagger. It had scarcely time to withdraw its head, when the ill-fated bird writhed, stiffened and died. Ethni seemed lost in a stupor, as, taking the dead raven from the cage, he stood holding it in his hand. Zillah augured well of this abstraction, and hastened to furnish another proof of Athaliah's perfidy: "And the ring, too, Ethni, which Athaliah gave thee to show Reuben in his death agony! dost not know it is an exact counterpart of one thy mother wears? And as Athaliah bears her no good will, was it not intended that thy victim should regard thy mother as the instigator of the crime committed by her son?" "So perish thy cursed mistress, thou ill-omened bird!" broke forth Ethni, suddenly aroused from his apathy, flinging the dead raven in the furthest corner of the room. "And thou!" apostrophizing the dagger he still held in his hand, "thou shalt not be long without another and a nobler victim t" He paced rapidly up and down the apartment. Zillah was thoroughly alarmed. Reuben, indeed, was safe; but in her attempting to awaken Ethni to a sense of right, she had raised a tempest of passion she felt herself powerless to direct or control. Into what terrible crimes might not love, so quickly changed to hate, hurry him. In her despair she raised her eyes to heaven, and, clasping her hands, murmured a prayer for Ethni's safety. There are actions more eloquent than words, and Ethni, even in the tumult of passion, was struck by the despairing yet earnest appeal so legible on Zillah's upturned, pallid face. "Why should she be so interested in my welfare? Has she not saved me from being the tool of an unprincipled woman? and why this despairing grief at my wild, un- governed passion?"These were questions he heard his soul ask, above the noise and confusion going on within him.   THE RESULT.         241 Then he reflected how mad the thought that he might avenge himself on Athaliah by her death! There must be other ways, or none! In any case, the sword, not the dagger, should be his weapon! He answered action by action. Stopping suddenly in his course, which had gradually grown less rapid, he drove his dagger into a cedar table. Its point snapped off, and re- mained imbedded in the wood. At this moment the crimson tapestry, which separated the apartment from the ante-chamber, parted, and Rebekah entered. CHAPTER XX. THE RESULT. REBEKAH had entered the apartment with the simple inten- tion of speaking to her son about the preparations necessary to be made for the approaching Feast of Tabernacles at Gibeon. On seeing Zillah in the room, the "Feast of Taber- nacles " was all forgotten. This, then, was why Ethni had not made his accustomed visit to her in her room! This omission was, to her, sufficient ground for displeasure; but the sight of Zillah, with head uncovered, and with the bearing rather of a guest than of a servant, thoroughly aroused her anger. "Zillah! What means thy presence here, in the apartment of my son?" Zillah, conscious, as she was, of the rectitude of the mo- tives that had governed her, now saw, for the first time, what an ill construction might be placed upon them. She became confused beneath the stern, searching gaze of her former mistress, and her downcast eyes and heightened  color confirmed, rather than dissipated, the insinuations con- tained in Rebekah's words. "Ethni, since she cannot speak, I demand of thee an ex- planation of this girl's presence here;" imperiously de- manded Rebekah. "Mother," firmly, but with respect, answered Ethni, "     242         ATHALIAH. "this maiden came here with the purest and best of mo. tives, and must not be lightly suspected. She has done thy son a great good." "And may I be permitted to enquire the cause of her coming?" ironically replied Rebekah, with mock humility. "That, I will not explain;" replied Ethni with some warmth, roused by the taunting tones of his mother. Be. sides, his late tumultuous feelings, only partially allayed, had left him in no very submissive mood. Rebekah somewhat restrained the anger she felt at this reply, for she was not willing that one who had been her serving-maid, should witness any altercation she might have with her son. This restraint she put upon herself only in- creased the anger with which she turned upon Zillah: "Child of an accursed race! Explain thy coming here, or I will have thee spurned from my gates." This injustice of Rebekah gave Zillah courage. Raising her head and fixing her eyes steadily on the angry counte- nance of her former mistress, she replied: "Whatever may have been my lineage, I am a proselyte to the holy religion thou professest, and, like thee, a worshipper of the true God, and I solemnly call upon that God to wit- ness that I came hither with no intent of ill to thee or thine." "Why, then, hesitate to explain thy coming?" enquired Rebekah, softened by the quiet dignity of Zillah. "I cannot. I am bound by an oath." "An oath!" scornfully retorted Rebekah, in rising an- ger!"Thou visitest my son at night, in his apartment, and when I, his mother, demand of thee an explanation of this secret meeting, thou talkest to me of oaths. Leave this house on the instant, or I will have thee thrust forth." Zillah, unabashed by the violence of this language, turned to withdraw, with the dignity, not of pride, but of conscious innocence. Ethni sprang forward, exclaiming: "Zillah, stay! I will not stand by and see thee the victim of such gross injustice. This house is mine, and thou shalt only leave it of thy own free will! Mother, I tell thee again she is innocent of all wrong. Thou gavest me life; she #as saved me from worse than death. This is all I will say, and it must suffice." There was so much in these words repugnant to the proud   THE RESULT.         243 spirit of Rebekah, that it was impossible for her to relent. Ethni's sudden assumption of authority, as master of the house; his defence of Zillah, coupled with the accusation of injustice against his mother; the comparison making Zillah the serving-maid, her equal, if not her superior; and his reit- erated refusal to give any explanation, all combined to arouse her pride and hurry her to say words not easily unsaid. Ethni, thou art no longer son of mine! This house is thy own, and I will leave it, and live henceforth at Gibeon, where I have a dwelling of which I am still the mistress. S  I will meet thee there in the services of the Tabernacle and of our religion, as I would the meanest of our race, but in this our intercourse must commence and terminate. Iwill notcurse thee, for evil enough will track the footsteps of the disobe- dient son." Zillah threw herself on her knees before the incensed Re- bekah, and implored her with tears not to let her be the cause of this separation of mother and son. Rebekah scorn- fully spurned her from her feet, and deigning no reply to this earnest appeal, left the apartment. Ethni hastened to raise the distressed Zillah to her feet "Oh! Ethni!" she tearfully exclaimed, "what have I done?" "Nay, Zillah, what have I done? This is alone the re- suit of my miserable infatuation! When I have somewhat retrieved my folly, I will confess all, and be reconciled to my mother." Why not now, this very night?" timidly urged Zillah. "No, no, Zillah, that is impossible;" and, as if to prevent further entreaty, hurriedly continued, "I have a favor to ask of thee. Return this ring to Athaliah, and with it this dagger. See; its envenomed point is harmlessly imbedded in this table. Say to her, for me, that I used it for no other purpose than to kill the raven she gave me. And, ZiHah, if thou ever needest the services of a true friend, send to me. I will summon a servant to accompany thee to thy home." Zillah received the ring and broken dagger, and, as she did so, her hand touched Ethni's. Slight as was that touch, it sent a thrill through her that warned her how still un- conquered was the hopeless love she cherished for Ethni. How little he dreamed of the pang in that suffering heart, as Zillah turned away from him, fearing even to' utter a     244          ATHALIAH. brief " farewell." Little did he imagine that her life was but an aspiration for his welfare-its one great object, his happiness and peace. CHAPTER XXI. THE MESSAGE. THE next morning Zillah went to the house of Athaliah to fulfil the mission entrusted to her by Ethni. Under or- dinary circumstances, she would have felt no little trepida- tion in the prospect of the meeting which was to take place. As it was, she felt a courage and coolness as new as it was strange to her. Ethni had called it a '" favor," and she was only too happy to have the power to fulfil his wishes. She sighed as she thought that this, perhaps, was the last service she could render him, and, so far from shrinking from it, she only felt regret that it was so little to do. She summoned a servant, and asked to see Athaliah. Af- ter a little time the servant re-appeared, and conducted her to an empty room. Rizpah, not Athaliah, soon entered. "Zillah, what means this strange request? Hast thou a message to Athaliah?" "I have." "From whom?" "That, it may be improper for me to tell, and I prefer conferring only with Athaliah," was Zillah's firm reply. Rizpah was surprised at the change she could not fail to notice in her daughter. What could have been the cause? and, would it be permanent? were questions she asked her- self in vain. "Zillah, this is strange language for thee to use towards thy mother," replied Rizpah, in much milder tones than Zillah expected she would employ; "there should be no se- crets between us." "But, mother, this is not my secret," respectfully re- sponded Zillah; "I am ready to serve thee in all things which my duty towards others and towards God will al- low."   THE MESSAGE.         245 Zillah had spent nearly. the entire night in communing with herself, and she had determined, henceforth, while show- ing all filial love and duty towards her mother, to be no more the blind tool of those whom she might be assisting to commit great wrongs. Rizpah began to have glimmerings of the cause that had produced so marked a change in Zillah. She hesitated, for craft is ever timid in the light and strength of open-hearted truth. She felt that violence might ruin all, and resolved to wait till she could discover more fully with what she had to contend. "And so thou canst not deliver thy message through me, as Athaliah requested?" enquired Rizpah. "I was told to see Athaliah, herself; " was Zillah's gentle answer, happy at having escaped what she feared would prove a stormy interview, when she first saw her mother enter the room. Rizpah, without further words, conducted Zillah quietly to the apartment where Athaliah awaited her. "Zillah can only deliver her message to thee," said Riz-. pah, addressing Athaliah. The women exchanged rapid i  glances of intelligence, unobserved by Zillah, who was in- wardly preparing herself for the trying scene she felt as- sured would soon commence. "Very well!" was Athaliah's unmoved reply; "leave US." Rizpah left the room. "Well, maiden, thou mayst speak; we are alone;" were the somewhat'haughty words of Athaliah. Zillah advanced towards her beautiful and subtle an- tagonist, who was gracefully reclining on a pile of silken cushions. I  "Ethni, the son of Rebekah-" "So, thou comest from him?" eagerly interrupted Atha- liah, half raising herself from her recumbent posture; then, as if fearing she had betrayed too much emotion, she re- sumed her former attitude, and, in cold tones, said: "Well, deliver thy message." "He bade me return thee this ring," said Zillah, as she extended it towards Athaliah, who made no motion to re- claim it, for she was determined to wait till all was known to her that Zillah had to tell, "and this broken dagger,"     246          ATHALIAH. proceeded the maiden, nerving herself for the coming storm she felt was inevitable," and to say to thee, that he used it for no other purpose than to kill the raven that thou gavest him." Athaliah sprang to her feet. No sting of a scorpion would have so startled, pained, maddened her. She spent the first outhurst of her rage on what was nearest her. "And who art thou, imp of Satan, that darest bring such messages to me? Worm! knowest thou not that I can crush thee?" "Thou canst kill me, but thou canst never again make me the blind instrument of thy wrong-doings,".was the calm, unmoved reply of Zillah. Such calmness, magnified by its contrast to Athaliah's vio. lence, somewhat recalled her to herself, but could not allay the fever of inveterate hate that coursed through her veins at this scornful indifference of the man she despised. "And when did this dog deliver thee this message?" fiercely demanded Athaliah. "I have said all I was told to say, and shall say no more," firmly replied Zillah, as she turned to withdraw, after laying the ring and dagger on a table. "Hold!" haughtily exclaimed Athaliah. "I have a message to send this craven-hearted fool." Zillah quickly turned her head, and a gleam of pleasure flitted over her face. She would again see Ethni, and once more listen to his words! Athaliah noted, even in the midst of her tumultuous pas- sion, this change of expression, and divined the cause. It told her two things: Zillah's opportunities for seeing Ethni were very limited, and that any opportunity that offered was gladly embraced. The conclusion was easily deduced: this maiden loved Ethni, and that love was unreturned, perhaps unnoticed. If there was, then, so little intimacy between them, it was better that Zillah should have nothing further to do in the matter. Besides, Athaliah felt her spite gratified at disap- pointing Zillah's expectations. She therefore paused, as if reflecting, then said, with all the asperity of which she was capable: "Go! I will send some other messenger to this Ethnl; and as for thee, see my face no more, nor enter under my   AT GIBEON.         247 roof, till thy mother has taught thee the submission that be- longs to the slave." "I am no slave! Though but a serving-maid, I am as free as thou art!" was Zillah's reply, roused at length by Athaliah's taunting words. Athaliah, carried away by her passion, applied to Zillah an epithet, which was an accusation that no high-minded i virtuous woman could brook. Intently regarding her, Zillah, in clear cutting tones, replied: I   "I am innocent of this vile accusation ; innocent, too, of X  placing in the hands of a Jewish noble a dagger, secretly   poisoned, for the purpose of a cowardly assassination. Canst thou say as much?" Without waiting a reply, Zillah turned and left the apart-   ment, and soon found herself in the street. She half re- :l  pented of the retort she had flung back at Athaliah, for she '?o feared it might, in some way, affect the safety of Ethni. But she thought, and there was keen pleasure in the reflection, that, unknown to Ethni, she would watch over his welfare as far as lay in her power; and something whispered to her that opportunities would not be lacking--could not pass un- improved by a heart so earnest, so devoted, so loving as beat within her bosom. CHAPTER    XXII. AT GIBEON. THE Feast of Tabernacles had drawn to the city of Gibeon the thousands of Israel. Court and camp, city and hamlet, mountain top and valley, each sent their representatives, to this one of the three great annual feasts. This city had enjoyed the pre-eminence of being the place where was pitched the identical tabernacle constructed in the wilderness by Moses, under God's directions, out of the spoils of the Egyptians, since the days of Saul, a period of about thirty-eight years. It is probable Saul selected this city, in preference to Gibeah, at that time the capital city of the kingdom, on account of its superior size, which thus     248          ATHALIAH. offered better accommodations for the tribes at the great festivals. Before each house, or on its roof, throughout this spacious city, which, after all, was capable of not holding more than a tithe of the multitudes that flocked hither, were erected booths, formed of the branches of trees, in which dwelt for seven days the children of Israel, spending the time in talk- ing of the law, or of events connected with their nation's his- tory. Each square of the city became, in itself, a leafy city, with avenues and streets ; while around the walls, stretching in every direction, appeared what, from a distance, looked like a dwarfed forest that had arisen in a single night. This Feast of Tabernacles was pre-eminently a joyous feast. The Passover, while it commemorated a great deliverance, still pointed to a bitter bondage, and the song of praise was tempered by humility and penitence. But here was thanks- giving without alloy. The labors of the husbandman had ceased, and the heart was gladdened by the rich stores of the ingathered harvest. The promises of summer %ere re- deemed, for God had sent sunshine and rain, and the land had given her increase. There were, among these myriads of booths, constructed of palm branches and the willows of the brook, three which claim particular attention. They were all within the walls, but in different parts of the city. In one of the squares of the city, Athaliah's booth was erected, for she possessed no house in Gibeon. This booth had two compartments, one of which was occupied by its mistress, the other by her servants, who had accompanied her. It was not generally customary for women to attend the feasts, but still there were many who did so, either from motives of piety or policy, for there was no surer road to kingly favor than by a strict adherence to the ceremonies ,of the law. It may readily be imagined that Athaliah had not left her comfortable and elegant house in Jerusalem, to dwell seven days in a booth, merely to explain to her servants the requirements of the Mosaic law, or to rouse their zeal by a recital of the great things God had done for the nation, or else to warn them of the evils of disobedience, by speaking of the terrible punishments inflicted on their fathers. Noth- ing of the kind I   AT GIBEON.         249 She told Caleb, her eldest servant, that he might perform her duties in this respect,' and, retiring to the inner compart- ment of the booth, plotted and planned with Rizpah. She had determined, finally, to strike the blow so long withheld, but to which the lengthening time had lent in- creasing force. There were, still, obstacles in the way; but, Ethni's sudden defection had necessitated a forcible removal of them, which a little more time might quietly have removed. Rebekah's booth was pitched in front of the house she owned in Gibeon. True to the words she had uttered in !I  the hearing of Zillah, she had that very night made prep- arations for her departure the next day. Ethni occupied the booth with her, yet no words but of the commonest -?A  necessity passed between them. He performed his duties tr  as head of the house with scrupulous fidelity, for he gladly /^  embraced any occupation that kept him from brooding over the miserable follies of his past life. }:   Rebekah, save in her hours of retirement, appeared the same cold, stern, but just mistress as of old--the same strict observer of each and every requirement of the ceremonial law. But when no eye, save the All-Seeing One, was upon her, the cold reserve melted in the consuming fire of a re- t  morse which no tears could quench. She had another burden now to bear, laid upon her by !   her pride-the separation from her son. Many an anxious questioning had she held with herself, as to the nature of that secret Ethni would not disclose to her. Could it have any connection, no matter how remote, with the sin of which she had been guilty so many years ago, but which still cast its dark shadow over her life? A vague fear, too, had re- cently taken possession of her. It was immediately after her return to Jerusalem, in the spring, that Ethni had de- fied her authority by entering the army, thus changing her entire plans concerning him. Was there something even more terrible awaiting her, after this feast? Could Re- bekah have heard the words that were even then passing between Athaliah and Rizpah, she would have been fear- fully answered. A happier scene awaits us in the booth of Adin. It will be remembered that Ahithophel had possessed a house in Gib- eon which had passed to his eldest grandson. It was in front of this house that the capacious booth had been erected. ' 11*     Its occupants were Adin, Helem, Miriam, and, of course, Benaiah. Besides these, there were the servants of the household, for it was a beautiful feature that, at these feasts, all distinctions of rank, save seniority of age, were laid aside. All were brethren-children of the one Great Pa- rent. Zillah, though she had been excluded from the booth, when living with Rebekah, who had held to the strict letter of the law, that none but an "Israelite born " could inhabit it during the Feast of Tabernacles, was admitted to Adin's booth; for Miriam, who was authority with her brothers in all matters relating to the law, adopted the more liberal interpretation that a proselyte, who observed all the require- ments of the Mosaic ritual, and enjoyed all its privileges, was in all essentials an "Israelite born," and thus entitled to this peculiar benefit. Though the duty of chief expounder fell on Adin, he managed very adroitly to draw Miriam out, by questioning her on certain points he really had forgotten, or feigned to forget. There was nothing restrained or formal in this de- lightful intercourse. No strange face or voice was there. Miriam, in sweet, earnest tones, recounted many a story of the heroic prowess of their ancestors fighting beneath the banner of the Lord of Hosts. Benoni had supplied her with the material she was now using, to illustrate their superiority as a nation, under the guidance and leadership of Jehovah, to all other nations, though thev might surpass them in the arts and luxuries of a more worldly and refined life. Helem seemed to possess an exuberance of spirit that nothing was capable of fully restraining. He raised many a laugh in the booth, by some queer question or remark, in which even Miriam, herself, who was more imbued with re- ligious feeling than any of them, could not always help joining. As for Benaiah, he had never felt happier. To be for a whole week constantly in the society of Miriam!-what happiness! How he hung on every word she uttered, and how proud he felt of possessing one so rich in all the graces and virtues of a peerless womanhood! Through what terrible scenes the lovers had passed, since the last Passover in the spring! A great rebellion, convuls- ing the nation and threatening its very life, drawing them   TIDINGS.          251 in its wild vortex; making brothers foes, fighting against each other under hostile standards; in a word, producing :  all those terrible complications of evils, aggravated by the in- variable result of civil war. Then, after peace to the nation, came their peculiar trial. Benaiah snatched, at the last moment, from the very jaws of death! Through all this troublous and tempestuous sea they had safely passed, and were now tranquilly sailing over placid waters, to the Eden of domestic peace and happiness. Surely such a deliver- ance called for the most devout thanksgiving, and the happy lovers mingled hearts in their gratitude to Him who had been their Great Protector. CHAPTER XXIII. TIDINGS, THE Feast of Tabernacles was fast drawing to a close. The same peculiar solemnities that had marked the first day, now characterized the seventh and last. The sun was nearing the western horizon, and at its sinking in the great sea the feast would end. Many a Jewish boy who, as the first born, had been brought by their fathers to Gibeon, watched its declining course, well knowing that at its dis- appearance all restraint would vanish, and they could in- dulge in the merry whoop and joyous gambol natural to their youth. The evening of this day, or rather the evening belonging to the next, was to witness the betrothal of Benaiah and Miriam. The terrible circumstance that had interrupted the ceremony in - Jerusalem, had caused them to select a place whose associations would remind them of naught but what was pleasant. As the day hurried to its close, and the shadows began lengthening and deepening, silence fell on the occupants of Adin's booth. Miriam had just read the one hundred and fifth and the one hundred and sixth Psalms, so singularly appropriate to this festival that their royal composer un- doubtedly intended them for this special use. Each seemed     252         ATHALIALIA disinclined to speak, after such impressive utterance of words so full of meaning. Just as the sun was setting, and while this silence was still unbroken, a man appeared at the entrance of the booth. His garments were travel-stained, and he had the jaded look of one who had journeyed far. "I seek Benaiah, the son of Ahaziah," was his abrupt announcement. "I am he;" said Benaiah, advancing towards him. The man fumbled in the folds of his dress, and, producing a letter, handed it to Benaiah, saying: "I was told to place this in thy hands." Benaiah received the letter, and the man was gone. His arrival and departure had been so sudden and unex- pected, that, but for the folded parchment in his hand, Benaiah might have doubted the occurrence. His hand trembled as he disengaged its fastenings, and unfolded the letter. His eye glanced but a moment over its contents, when it dropped from his nerveless grasp, and he staggered back as if he had received a strong and sudden blow. Miriam, with a dread foreboding of some unknown trouble, sprang forward, not to question her lover, but -to seize the parchment that lay passive on the ground. One look-one despairing cry, and the stricken Miriam fell faint- ing in Helem's arms! Rachel hurried forward, and her unconscious mistress was conveyed into the house beneath her tender and superin- tending care. The sun had set, the feast was ended, the booth deserted! Not quite deserted! One remained, its sole occupant- Zillah. She had taken the letter from the ground, where, in the general anxiety and confusion, it had been forgotten. As she became aware of its contents, no sudden burst of grief escaped her; but she stood as if transfixed with won- der. Then tears filled her eyes, and, overflowing, coursed in quick succession down her cheeks. Reuben was dead! He who had been the brave preserver of her life, who had poken such words of tender kindness to her, was no more! That strong arm was palsied in death; those lips for ever silent. She had known him in life but one brief hour, and yet she felt, she scarce knew why, a vacant place in her heart that none could henceforth fill.   TIDINGS.         253 The overpowering grief. of Benaiah and Miriam was not wholly occasioned by the mere fact of Reuben's death, but that it placed an insurmountable bar to their union. Reu- ben had died childless, and Benaiah must marry the widow, or be for ever disgraced. By a singular coincidence, this law of marriage had been discussed that very day in the booth; hence this peculiar effect of Reuben's death presented itself instantly to the lovers' minds. Like many of the injunctions of the Mosaic law, it had existed long before that law was written. The patriarch Judah had enforced it in his family, in the case of Onan, and God had given his sanction to it then, by visiting with sud- den death Onan for neutralizing its effect. It is very probable that this peculiar ordinance originated with Abraham, after the promise that from his loins was to issue the Saviour of mankind. The birth of a son in a Jewish family was hailed with delight, and the person who could first make the glad announcement to the father was sure of receiving a reward; while in the case of a daughter being born, no one hastened to tell it, and the mother's heart sank with disappointment that it was not a man-child she had brought into the world, for then she might have hoped, all might have hoped, that the child would prove the promised Messiah. This was the lofty ambition of every Jewish mother. To be childless, was the most grievous of inflictions that could be laid upon a Jewish mother's heart. Hear Rachel's despairing cry, "give me children, or else I die;" or else witness that most touching incident in the life of Hannah, who, finding her prayers unanswered, at length promised God, that if he would only send her a son she would give him up again as soon as he no longer needed her care; ex- pose herself to all the anguish of exiling him from her house Ajd -in his tenderest years, simply for the sake of being a mother; :',.3 retaining only the poor privilege of seeing him " once every year," and beguiling the pain in her heart produced by the vacant little place at home, by working on the " little coat" she took him every twelvemonth. There was more than nature's instinct in this, and a better reason for this rigorous law, which often ruthlessly trampled on the tenderest feelings of the heart, than the mere fact of perpetuating a name.     The penalty of violating this law was worse than death. It affixed a stigma on the man's name that disregarded it, so indelible, that it descended to his latest posterity. His shoe was loosed from off his foot, and his face was spit upon in open court by the woman whose rights he had failed to acknowledge, thus making his noblest part vile as the earth on which all, even unclean beasts, tread, and the opprobrious epithet applied to his descendants-" the house of him who hath his shoe loosed." But to return to those whose hopes had been so terribly  blighted through the agency of this law. Through the application of restoratives, applied by the : tender care of the devoted Rachel, Miriam was soon re- : stored to consciousness. She begged to be left entirely alone. Benaiah urged that her maid should remain in at- tendance upon her; but with gentle firmness, and a touching sadness, Miriam persisted in her request. Then, alone with her God, she resolutely combatted with  the rebellious feelings of her heart. There was no uncer- tainty, in her mind, as to the results of this blow that had i fallen so suddenly and terribly upon them. Separation from Benaiah was as inevitable as if he lay dead before her, a i separation worse than that produced by death, for he would be another's, and tender, loving memories she else might cherish for him, she would now have to deny herself. "Why had they ever met; or, meeting, loved?" cried out her stricken heart. Then it rebelliously rose up and : demanded, "Why was such a law enjoined? was woman's  heart only a thing to be trampled on and disregarded? i" Long and bitter was the struggle, but Miriam at last con-  quered, and became resigned to God's will, though even g then she felt the battle would again be renewed. From the  first, she had had no thought of giving her consent to the  least evasion of the law, even had Benaiah proposed it. Hecr struggle had not been against the fate that seemed so ruth- lessly to pursue them, but for power to calmly acquiesce in God's will concerning them. One bitter ingredient in her cup of sorrow could not be extracted: Benaiah and she could not meet again as lovers! He was virtually another's, and the claims of that afflicted woman, now mourning for her husband in her desolated home in the mountains of Naphtali, must be scrupulously   regarded. Benaiah would probably forget this and she  who loved him so deeply, so fondly, and who would ever, must ever, continue to love him thus, would have to repulse him and teach him the hard and bitter lesson, that from  the moment they perused that fatal letter they were only  friends-nothing more. She felt, too, that it would require all the strength God could infuse into her pre-occupied heart to go through one  interview. Others would be unnecessary; therefore she rea-  soned, the first must be the last. This, too she must commu- nicate to Benaiah. Why, in all such struggles, does the heaviest share fall to  woman's part? Is it not that, by long practice in patient, hidden endurance, which appears their portion in this life, they have attained and transmitted a strength and purity  of heart man does not possess? In the meanwhile, Benaiah was endeavoring to find traces of the man who had been the messenger of such dread ti- dings. The letter had been written by an old servant in his father's family, named Ulam, who had simply announced the fact of Reuben's death, without entering into any par- ticulars. Benaiah was, therefore, desirous of learning, if pos- sible, from the man he was seeking, all the circumstances at- tending the sad and terrible event. In the crowded state of the city, this search was well- nigh hopeless. If the messenger had passed the city gates, and mingled with the surrounding sea of people, it was entirely so. After spending several hours in searching, which the darkness of the night rendered difficult and laborious, he at length gave it up and returned to  Adin's house. Much to his surprise, he learned that the  messenger had been there in quest of him, and, failing to see him, had communicated to Helem the particulars of Reu- ben's death. The man had acted in accordance with orders from Ulam, to this effect: First, to deliver the letter; and  afterwards, to embrace a fitting opportunity to state the de- tails. They were simply these:  Reuben had arrived safely home, the day after his de- parture from Jerusalem. He appeared particularly restless,  and spent most of his time either scaling the mountain    i: heights on mule-back, or exploring their ravines on foot. One day he announced, his intention, which was not usu-  u:" '!*.-; I,     256          ATHALIAH. ally his custom, of ascending a certain lofty mountain peak, a peak which the hardiest mountaineer had never yet attempted, probably because it could be attended by no practical re. sults to compensate for the danger incurred. Sarah feebly attempted to turn him from his purpose, but without effect. As usual with him, on such excursions, he went unattended, accompanied only by one of the surest- footed of his mules. Day waned, and night closed in, but Reuben came not. Sarah felt no great apprehensions, as yet, for he often was away for two days together. An- other day passed, still he did not return. On the third day, Sarah grew alarmed, and dispatched a party of household and farm servants to search the moun- tain passes and ravines. They had scarcely left the house, when they met three men bearing the dead form of their master. One of their number had found his bruised and lifeless body at the bottom of a ravine, lying beside his dead mule. On ascending the mountain pass above it, the cause of the accident was revealed. Over the narrowest and most dangerous part of the rocky pathway, water had trick- led from the precipitous rock that rose abruptly on one side, which the keen mountain air had quickly converted- into ice. Drifting leaves had treacherously covered this slip- pery path. The mule had unexpectedly slipped, and, mak- ing too sudden an effort to recover himself, had precipi- tated himself and his rider into the ravine below. The man who brought the message had been the first to make this discovery, and had, therefore, been commissioned by Ulam to make the journey and bear the tidings to Jerusalem. Dearly as Benaiah loved the brother who had always evinced a mother's tenderness towards him, his heart was too much pre-occupied to admit of that grief which would otherwise have filled it. He mourned deeply and sincerely his brother's loss; but his greater grief at losing Miriam- for he felt little hope that his efforts to, in some way, evade the law, would prove successful-swallowed up, like Aaron's rod, all other semblances of sorrow. Helem, hopeful as he had been in Benaiah's late critical position, saw no hope here. He knew Miriam's iron firm- ness of character, where principle was involved and sacri- fice demanded, still he would not entirely discourage Benaiah, but told him plainly that entreaty, no matter how   THE PRIEST.         257 earnest, he did not believe would prevail. He must appeal to her intellect by argument, not to her heart by persuasion. He also suggested that Benaiah should consult a priest-the !  city was full of them--and see whether the fact of their being so nearly betrothed in Jerusalem, would not exonerate him from marrying Sarah. Here was a hope, though a faint one, and Benaiah eagerly grasped it. Though the evening was already far spent, he determined instantly to act, and, i  leaving Helem, he went in search of a priest. i          CHAPTER XXIV. THE PRIEST. THE tabernacle occupied a spacious square in the centre of the city. The buildings surrounding it on each of its four sides, were inhabited by the priests who at the time were on duty in the tabernacle service; and at the three I  great festivals, accommodated, as far as their capacity would admit, all the priests who had left their respective cities to come to Gibeon. There was an old priest, named Haniel, who had known Benaiah's father and mother, and who, to great knowledge and experience, added a kindness of heart that rendered him a very desirable adviser for the young. He had been early left a widower with an only child, a daughter. All his affections had become centred in her, and when she married a younger son of the Prince of Naphtali, he left his city of Anathoth in Benjamin, and henceforth made his home in her husband's house. It was thus that he had be- come acquainted with Ahaziah's family, who lived in the immediate vicinity of his new home. He was so well known, that Benaiah had but little diffi- culty in finding him. Very cordial was the greeting the aged priest extended toward him. "Benaiah, I am heartily glad to see thee! Nothing re- joices my heart so much as to see the young men of Israel growing up, valiant in war, and regular in their observances of the law. But, my son!" proceeded Haniel, more particu-     ZOO       -    ATHAgH g larly regarding the distressed countenance of Benaiah,;  "thou lookest like one in great sorrow!" "My brother, Reuben, is dead!" abruptly replied Benaiah., "Reuben, dead?" exclaimed the astonished priest; " why, he was in the prime of life."  Benaiah hastily explained the circumstances of his broth- er's death; for he was impatient to hear the priest's opinion A regarding the course he might pursue in his present diffi- culty.                           "This is, indeed, very distressing, my son!" replied Han. iel, after Benaiah's recital. "But there is something still more distressing, my father: The law requires me to marry my sister-in-law, Sarah, while, this very evening, the ceremony of betrothal was to have taken place with a maiden whom I most ardently love." :i Haniel sadly shook his head, for while zealous for the law, : he was still alive to all kindly sympathies for the young, and, in his long and varied experience, he had seen the worldly happiness of many a heart wrecked on this very rock. }a "Pity that thy vows had not been exchanged before these sad tidings came."                   1 "That is the very point I wish to consult thee about," eagerly rejoined Benaiah. "It is but a few weeks since,  that the ceremony of our betrothal was taking place in Je- rusalem, when it was suddenly interrupted. Now-" "How interrupted?" broke in the astonished Haniel.  "By my arrest." "Thy arrest! I do not understand thee! For what  cause?" "For defending my brother Reuben, in the battle of the wood .of Ephraim, during Absalom's rebellion," replied ' Benaiah, somewhat impatiently, for he longed to have the priest decide his fate. ' My son!" exclaimed the thoroughly mystified Haniel, "I have heard nothing of this before, and cannot understand ^i what offence there could be in defending Reuben!"  "It was called treason, for Reuben was fighting on the side of Absalom." H "And did that subtle Prince succeed in luring from his loyalty so brave and true a soldier as Reuben?" sadly re- : sponded Haniel. "Well was it, Benaiah, that thy mother, Na- omi, lived not to see that day."    THE PRIEST.         259 c"Reuben erred, no doubt; but believe me, it was from no base motive he joined the Prince's standard. I cannot explain it, but he thought his duty to God required him to pursue the course he did. But tell me," eagerly pursued Benaiah, " did not that ceremony of betrothal, though not fully completed, exonerate me from marrying Sarah?" "Was the ring of betrothal placed upon the maiden's finger before the ceremony was interrupted?" enquired the priest. "It was not," replied Benaiah, and his heart sank, for he knew now what the decision would be. "Then the ceremony went for nothing," responded Haniel, and then, in gentle, soothing tones, he proceeded: "Sarah is a gpod and virtuous woman, Benaiah, and will prove an excellent wife." Benaiah made a gesture of impatience, which, but for the state of excitement he was in, would have seemed lacking in the respect due to the aged Haniel. "Is there no way in which I can evade this law?" ex- claimed Benaiah; and then quickly added, " honorably, of course," for he was warned by a kindling light in the old man's eyes to make this addition. "Thou art a soldier, my son," replied the priest, solemnly, yet kindly; "and as such, thou never questionest the orders given thee, though they lead thee on to death. So, in the battle of life thou must obey the Great Commander, no matter at what cost or sacrifice. And let me urge thee nanfully to fulfil thy duty. Who is the maiden thou art thus required to relinquish?" "Miriam, daughter of Elkanah, son of Ahithophel," was Benaiah's half-moody reply. "My old friend Benoni often spoke to me about her. She is indeed a lovely and high-souled woman, and will nobly sustain thee in the path of duty." Benaiah rose to depart. The venerable priest laid his hand upon his head, and gave him his fervent blessing. With a leaden weight on his heart, Benaiah retraced his steps to Adin's house. Helem was awaiting his return. Is there any hope?" "None, unless with Miriam." "Do not count upon that,' gravely replied Helem. "I have seen her, and had some little conversation with her. I see no way out of this."   260          ATHALIAH.  "And I, but one," gloomily replied Benaiah. "In my search X! through the city after the man who brought us the tidings of my brother's death, I heard rumors of an expedition in force against the Philistines, who have been committing fresh depredations on our borders. I may be more fortunate in war than in love, and manage to get rid of all life's X troubles at once." "Cheer up! cheer up! Benaiah. Things are not so bad  as to require such a fierce remedy as death," hopefully ex- claimed Helem.                     i "Death is better than to marry on compulsion," bitterly  rejoined Benaiah.  CHAPTER XXV. THE SEPARATION.            t THE sun rose clear the next morning, and Benaiah, in the bright light, felt hope revive in his heart. A thought had  occurred to him of marrying both Miriam and Sarah, but had ?: been instantly dismissed, for he felt he would not dare to : offer Miriam, if not a divided heart, at least a divided home. i A plurality of wives was not prohibited by the law, but theg general sense of the nation was against it, except when in- : dulged in by one of kingly rank. But Miriam was so  ;: exalted in Benaiah's eyes that he felt it little short of pro- fanation even to imagine her sharing his heart and home  with another.                     i When Benaiah and Miriam met, she was spared the pain of being obliged to repulse a too affectionate greeting.  Benaiah's good sense had taught him that the relation be- tween them had changed, and, till it could be restored again, : the nature of their intercourse must change too. Miriam looked pale and sad. Benaiah's heart bled at seeing her look so unhappy, and he determined, for her sake, : to devise some plan of escape, and urge her acceptance of it. They had hardly exchanged a word since the dread tid- ings had arrived that had separated them.   THE SEPARATION.        261  "Thou hast heard the particulars of my brother's death, Miriam?" commenced Benaiah. "Helem told them to me. How terrible thus to be cut off with hardly a moment's warning I When art thou going to thy new home?" asked Miriam, with as much firmness as she could command. "Mayhap never 1" replied Benaiah. "An expedition in -a force against the Philistines is talked about, and may set out at any moment." The Lord preserve thee in all thy goings!" piously ejacu- lated Miriam. "What is mere life, Miriam, without happiness?" was the impulsive exclamation of Benaiah. "Everything!" quickly replied Miriam. "Life's great object is duty; happiness will come hereafter." Benaiah preferred some happiness here. He had not Miriam's faith-always sublime, but never so sublime as in the days when they " saw the promises afar." He felt that if he could accomplish anything, it must be done speedily. "Miriam, dear Miriam, must our happiness in this life be thus hopelessly wrecked?" "In this life? yes! Let us but be faithful here, and we will meet again hereafter." Still that " hereafter!"Benaiah grew impatient. "Miriam, is it thy wish we should separate?" impetuously demanded Benaiah. "It is God's will, and I bow before it." "Miriam, thou art sacrificing our happiness from a mista- ken sense of duty. Suppose the ceremony of our betrothal in Jerusalem had been quite, instead of almost, completed, would my sister-in-law have any claim on me then?" "I think not, but cannot say certainly." "But Haniel, an aged priest, .well versed in the law, told me she would not, in such a case," hurriedly responded Be- naiah. "And what said the learned Haniel when the ceremony was but partially performed?" eagerly asked Miriam, her cheek tinged with the rosy hue of hope, her eye brightened with its light. Benaiah's heart bounded as he saw this evidence of Miri- am's affection, but sank, saddened, sickened, as he thought what his answer mu'st be, and what would prove its inevita-  262        ATHALIAH.   ble results. In his thoughtless endeavor to shake the strength of Miriam's convictions, he had only confirmed them. "That the ceremony counted for nothing, unless the ring of betrothal was placed upon thy finger," slowly replied Be- naiah, and then impetuously exclaimed: "Miriam, ought such a little thing as this, the mere question of scarcely a minute's time, determine the happiness or misery of two lives?" 4 Oh, Benaiah!" earnestly responded Miriam, " why dis- tress ourselves with such considerations as these? There is but one question--'What is our duty?' but one course, to follow its path, let it lead where it will!!" c"Miriam! thou canst not love as I do, or thou wouldst not thus calmly cast away what is dearer to me than life!" A sharp pang shot through Miriam's heart at these words of Benaiah. Her burden was heavy enough to bear, without this addition. She felt how perilous it would be to lengthen out this interview; saw clearly how indispensable it was that this should be the last. Summoning all her strength, she replied: "Benaiah, it is because I love thee, and will ever do so, that makes it necessary that we should part, and see each other no more! I do not cast away that which when given up, leaves my life desolate. God has taken it from us, and we must submit. I do not think only of the disgrace that would be fixed on thee and on thy house, but of the greater evil of openly violating a command of God. Oh! Benaiah!" continued Miriam, with a burst of tenderness she could not, cared not, to control: " my first, last, only love! go and fill- fil life's duties. If we suffer and live separate here, we will be happy and united in a better world!" Benaiah heard only Miriam's avowal of her affection. He clasped her to his heart in a fond embrace. His lips met her's; all was forgotten in this sweet delirium of love. It was, however, but the madness of the moment. Miriam was gone--gone to pour out her tears and anguish on the bosom of her God, while back on Benaiah's heart came surging the billows of a great grief, and he went his way, knowing that he would see Miriam no more.     BOOK III. A RETROSPECT.   CHAPTER L    THE STRANGER. IT is now necessary to trace the earlier life of certain of the characters who have figured in the preceding pages. It was in the eleventh year of King David's reign, dating from his assumption of royal dignity in the city of Hebroln, and twenty-three years previous to the-events already re- lated, that the following scene took place: On a rocky eminence not far from the city of Gibeah, a few years since the royal city, stood the residence of Benoni. The place had originally been barren and ut- terly unproductive, but by great labor it had been made to bud and blossom like the rose."  A succession of terraces rising from the narrow valley that lay between it and the city, extended nearly to the top, where it joined a plantation of olive trees, through whose leafy screen the dwelling was scarce visible. Flowers of varying hue and of richest fra- grance lurked in every spot where they were permitted to grow-the natural daughters of the soil-while firom ter- race to terrace climbed the clustering vine, and in the mel- lowing sunlight gleamed the purple fruit. Sounds of merry voices and light-hearted laughter issued from the house, for in it were gathered those on whose spirits lay no shadows, and in whose ear no prophecies were whis- pered, save of love and happiness to come. Not far from the house, and within hearing of this merry music, two women were engaged in conversation. A clump of low-spreading trees shielded them from the rays of the   1,     264        ATHALIAI.   THE THREE RINGS.265   sun, and screened them from observation. The one was the servant of the house, and near her stood the water-pitcher she had recently filled at the spring, halfway down the hill, where she had first been accosted by the damsel now talking to her. The conference thus far had related to a scarf of silk, which Hannah-for that was the name of the servant- had selected from the stranger's stock of goods, as the most desirable thing she had, but whose price placed it be- yond her reach, which fact seemed only to enhance its beauty in the serving-woman's eyes. The stranger was evidently, of another nation than the Jewish. The darker complexion, the keen restless eye, the look of quick intelligence, the elastic step, all proclaimed her the wandering daughter of a wandering race. "Thou servest in a merry house," said the stranger, as a burst of laughter louder than was wont came floating on the breeze. "Merry enough to-day, but usually dull and quiet," re- plied Hannah, not averse to talking about her betters even to a perfect stranger. "My master, Benoni, has visitors to-day." "Young ones, too, I should think." "Yes, young and beautiful. Benoni's sons have been for- tunate in winning such fair maidens, for they have had many and noble suitors." "They are married, then?" "Oh, no! I Rebekah and Elnathan, that is, the oldest son, are soon to be; but Athaliah and Heber are not even yet espoused." "Are Rebekah and Athaliah sisters?" enquired the stran- ger, fearing not to ask open questions when she found how ready and willing Hannah was to speak. "No; their fathers were brothers. They are like sisters, though; they have been brought up together, and they are seldom seen apart." "What were their fathers' names?"' "Eshton and Joel, the sons of Shallum," was Hannah's reply, as she tried the effect of a new light on the scarf. Could she have seen the terrible light that flashed in the stranger's eyes at the mention of these names, her commu- nications would have ceased then and there, for, though   fond of talking, she was too faithful a servant to hold any converse with one whose glance could reveal such revengeful passion, and who might make such bad use of any informa- tion gained. ' I have walked far to-day," said the stranger, calmly, all trace of the terrible emotion that had just possessed her vanishing, " and feel too weary to go further. Let me tarry in this house till to-morrow, and thou mayest have the scarf at half the price I named." Hannah would gladly have consented, but she feared to take the liberty of receiving into the house a stranger with- out her master's consent. But there was the scarf cun- ningly, displayed in all its richness and beauty, and she looked upon it as Eve did on the apple, or Achan on the Babylonish garment, and, imitating their example, yielded. "Thou must keep out of sight of my master," stipulated IIannah; " and now, what is thy name? 5 "Rizpah." CHAPTER II. THE THREE RINGS. THE laughter has ceased, and the summer parlor from which it emanated is now almost deserted. Benoni remains in it. He has attained his fiftieth year, but " his eye is not dim, nor his natural force abated."5 Far from it! Those clear eyes beam with merriment, or glow with kindly sym- pathy for all who are distressed. His daughter, Myra, enters the room. She had a few min- utes since strolled out with the lovers to an orange grove facing the long open windows of the summer parlor, and now returned. "'In the way, Myra?" laughingly enquired Benoni. "O, no! dearest father!  Rebekah insisted I should re- main with her and Elnathan; but I preferred being with thee." Benoni tenderly drew his beloved daughter towards him, and imprinted a kiss on her fair brow, 12   It       THE THREE RINGS.   267   c Myra, Athaliah and Heber said nothing about thy re. maining with them? ' enquired the father. "No, indeed," laughingly exclaimed Myra; " they are for ever running off by themselves." '"Dost think, my dear daughter, that Rebekah loves Elnathan as much as Athaliah does Heber?"There was a little anxiety in the tone in which these words were uttered. "I don't know, father," laughingly answered Myra, archly shaking her head. "What should I know of any love, save that which I bear thee?" Further discussion was stopped by the entrance of Re- bekah, followed by her lover. '"Elnathan has just told me of some wonderful rings thou hast, the story of which is equally strange. Wilt thou not show us these rings and tell us the story?" "4 Oh yes, father," exclaimed Myra; " show the great trea- sure of our house, and tell the strange story." Benoni assented, with a smile that lit up his noble face. Rebekah hastened to the window, which extended to the floor, and through which she had entered, and, calling for Athaliah and Heber, announced the treat in store for them. As Athaliah entered the room a faint tinge was on her cheek, and a soft light in her eye, that looked very much as if the eloquent Heber had been telling her a story about one ring, not three. Hannah was only half right when she said Athaliah was beautiful-she was more. Hair was never a greater glory to a woman than was hers to her-soft, glossy, luxuriant, it was a crown of beauty no queen could purchase. Her eyes were dark, lustrous, and of unfathomed depth. But what made her so transcendantly lovely, was the clearness and purity of her complexion. It had won for her, and well she deserved it, the title of "The Pearl of Gibeah." Rebekah was but little less beautiful. Some thought her equally so-Elnathan, for instance-but what a judge! Still, she well deserved her name, "The Rose of Gibeah." Now for the "Three Rings." They were enclosed in a casket of olive wood, beautifully polished, and inlaid with silver and ivory. "They have been in our family four hundred and seven years," said Benoni, as he displayed them to the admiring gaze of the fair cousins.   The rings were all exactly alike and tied together by a silken cord, to which was attached a scroll of parchment. Each ring contained seven jewels, occupying the entire cir- clet, curiously set in golden claws. The gems, which were large and cut with the greatest skill, were the emerald, the ruby, the diamond, the topaz, the sapphire, the amethyst, and the carbuncle. Athaliah blipped one of the rings on her finger. Heber quickly thrust one on his finger, and thus their hands became joined by the silken cord which held the rings together. A tinge stained the matchless purity of Athaliah's cheek at this mischievous yet loving action of Heber. All now seated themselves in front of Benoni, to hear the story of the rings. Of course, it was new only to Rebekah and Athaliah.   )   HSTORY OF THE THREE RINGS.   "It is well known to you," commenced Benoni, "that, when our fathers were about to leave for ever their Egyptian bondage, Moses gave command to all the children of Israel, that they should borrow jewels of gold and jewels of silver, and raiment. You also well know the wonderful success that  followed these applications. None refused. This, in great measure, was the result of the fear with which the Egyp- tians regarded our great Law Giver, acting as the minister of Divine vengeance. However obdurate Pharoah might be, they had had too much reason to tremble at re-awaken- ing the wrath of the God of the Hebrews, by refusing his people anything. "Still, there were cases, and the one I am about to relate is one of them, when there appears to have been a direct influence exerted on the heart by God. "Shemaiah, of the tribe of Judah, whose lineal descend- ants we are, in obedience to the general command, visited a " house, and asked to borrow jewels and raiment. It was of a very aged man he made this request, who returned reply, that they had already lent to former applicants what they had to spare. Shemaiah was about turning away, when a  young woman, who appeared to be the only companion of the old man, said, Father, there are the rings.' "' Silence, child! Wouldst thou have me bring ruin on     268          ATHALIAH. my house? ' he violently exclaimed ; then, turning to Shem- aiah, pronounced the single word ' stay.'  Then, as if obeying a force he was still striving to resist, he slowly, step by step, after stopping, then slowly going on again, left the room; and returning, placed in Shemaiah's hands, with the most painful reluctance, the three rings tied to- gether as they are now. He called his attention to the writing on the scroll, which, in substance, was this: that if the rings were kept together, peace and prosperity would dwell in the house where they were; but if separated, woe and death would follow. "In the wilderness, when offerings were made for the Tab- ernacle, Shemaiah took the rings, just as they were, to one of Aaron's sons. The priest's attention was attracted to this curious offering. He perused the scroll, and examined the curious characters engraved on the inside of the ring. 1' He evidently did not like to receive, for the service of the Lord, what he feared might be some of the abominations of the Egyptians. And yet, how could he refuse? He was, how- ever, happily delivered from the strait he was in, by just then receiving a command from Moses that the liberality of the people must be restrained. The offerings already were more than enough. The priest handed back the rings to Shemaiah, highly commending his liberality, and telling him that it was as well pleasing to God as if he had parted from his goods. "Shemaiah carefully kept the rings, and for over four hun- dred years they have been handed down from father to son, and their history with them." "Wonderful, indeed!" exclaimed Rebekah. "But who will tell us the history of these marvellous rings, before Shem- aiah took them?" "I will," said Heber, with a mock gravity that seemed completely to deceive her. Rebekah regarded the handsome youth with an intensity of expression hardly justified by any interest she could possibly feel in the absurd story he manufactured as he went along: "After the father, comes the son, though in this case I precede my revered ancestor some hundreds of years," com- menced Heber. A merry twinkle gleamed in Benoni's eyes, that even his anxiety regarding Rebekah's love for Elnathan could not quench, at this caprice of his favorite son.  THE THREE RINGS.         269     i And then Heber went on. to relate, how that " many long years previous to the exodus of their ancestors from Egypt, a man in the still hours of night had surprised a noted gold- smith, whose love of gain kept him in his shop when other men were content to be in their homes. The sudden ad- vent of this mysterious individual would have alarmed the smnith, had he not scattered over the table, at which he was working, a profusion of jewels such as even his experienced eyes had never seen before. Every hue of the rainbow flashed and sparkled from the lustrous heap. Wealth of which he had never dreamed, lay within his reach. He glanced at the possessor of these rich gems, wondering what his object could be in thus displaying treasures which even a king might covet. "With a wonderful facility'the stranger selected from the glowing pile three sets, of seven jewels each, so like in hue, and form and size, that it was impossible to detect any dif- ference in them. "' Make three rings, of exactly the same pattern, and set these jewels in them. If even jealous eyes can detect no difference in them, all that remains of these gems are thine.' "So saying, the stranger, who was simply Satan, departed. When he came again, in garb so mortal that he even at- tracted the admiration of the goldsmith's wife, true daugh- ter of Eve, who chanced to be present, the rings were fin- ished, inspected, and pronounced perfect. He begged the pleasure of placing one upon the finger of the goldsmith's beautiful wife. She readily consented. The husband frowned; but, thinking of the jewels, the price of his labor, finally concluded to smile. "Now, it was a terrible law of those rude times, that all women were obliged to dress alike; and still more terrible, at least to the pretty ones, that they must never venture forth, except they were closely veiled. Now, Satan had bestowed the remaining rings on women not entirely de- ficient in the charms that work such mischief on earth. "The three wearers of the rings were constantly mistaken for each other, and in time fearful tragedies ensued. In brief, their husbands became wifeless; and, strange to say, when the wives were put to death, the rings mysteriously disappeared but only to appear upon the finger of some new candidates for death.  27i0         ATHALAH.  "Such fearful havoc among the female population of the kingdom at length attracted the attention of the King. To do away with the good old law of allowing a husband to extinguish his wife on suspicion of her fidelity, was not to be thought of. The simpler remedy remained of getting the three rings together, and forbidding any woman from again wearing them." "And now," continued Heber, at the same time placing the rings, which he held in his hand, on the fingers of Atha- liah, Rebekah, and his sister Myra, " to show a proper disre. gard to the command of this king of Egypt, long since dust and ashes, cut the cord, father, and let the rings re- main where I have placed them." "' Not on my finger, Heber," exclaimed Myra; "I am not afraid to have the rings separated, but I would rather have the third ring remain in its box, as a memorial in our family. Come, dear father, cut the cord." Elnathan joined in his brother's and sister's request. Be- noni hesitated. It was something to separate these rings, which had been united in the family more than four hun- dred years. But he at length complied. The cord was cut; two rings given to the beautiful cousins, and the third put away in the box which had been so long their receptacle. That night one of those violent and sudden gusts that sometimes sweep through the valleys of Judea arose and tore off the roof of Benoni's dwelling. Fortunately all the in- mates of the house escaped unhurt. The furniture in the second story was scattered far and wide. A cabinet contain- ing the box in which the ring was placed, was blown some distance, and shattered to pieces, but the box and ring could nowhere be found. CHAPTER    III. THE ROSE AND THE PEARL. ATHALIAH and Rebekah were early deprived of their mothers by death; and when they were about six years of age, a terrible event had occurred which rendered them    THE ROSE AND THE PEARL.        (1j ix wholly orphans. This event was the murder of their grand-  father Shallum, and their fathers, Eshton and Joel, in the same day, by a young Arab, who, when seized, refused to give his name, but boldly avowed he had committed the  deed to avenge a wrong so deep that the blood already  shed did not suffice, and that others, after his death, would  pursue the work of vengeance.  He was stoned to death  by the enraged citizens of Gibeah, in which city Shallum   and his sons had always stood high in popular favor. Vain were the conjectures to which this bloody deed gave rise. It was doubtless, as the young Arab had said, an act of  vengeance for some wrong, but what could that wrong be?  However, in the exciting events then transpiring, for it was about the tim:e that King Saul and his sons were slain, and the kingdom partially transferred to David, the city soon forgot it, or rather ceased to talk about it. Hanani, the nearest male relative of the family, though a distant one, became the guardian of the afflicted orphans.  They still resided in the house in which Athaliah was born,  and as she was the daughter of the eldest brother, Eshton, it now became her own. Nothing further occurred to mar the tranquil happy life  of the two cousins, who thus grew up as sisters. Elnathan, the eldest son of Benoni, had made their acquaintance while  his father and brother Heber were absent. He succeeded  in winning the affections of the Rose of Gibeah, as Rebekah  was called, and soon after his father's and brother's return they were formally espoused. -Ieber was not long in imitating the example of his brother.  He secretly congratulated himself that Athaliah was the cousin that had been left. He esteemed her far the most  beautiful, and besides this, her manner was quiet, and as he was impulsive, and often used his tongue more than his brains, this contrast in their dispositions was a source of  delight to him. Perhaps for this reason she preferred him to many of the suitors who had already sought her hand. However that might be, soon after the espousal of Rebekah  and EInathan, Hanani and Benoni, as heads of the high con- tracting powers, were notified that their permission was re-  quired for just such another ceremonial. It may be re- marked in passing, that either the age was improving, or else that the sons of Benoni were ahead of their fellows, for       273   272          ATHALIAH. instead of saying to their father, " get me such an one of her father for a wife," or else waiting quietly till the wife was picked out, without their asking, they chose for them- selves, and only asked permission to espouse the one they had chosen. Benoni readily consented. In every respect, no better wife for Heber could have been chosen; for, added to her beauty and virtue, there was the consideration of the in- heritance which, as Heber was a younger son, was of no small account in the paternal calculation. It is to be pre- sumed that Heber had not even thought of this last item. Who will say, then, that fathers ought not to choose wives for their sons? Hanani was equally ready with his consent. He could not better fulfil the trust committed to him than seeing his beautiful relatives marry into so good a family as Beno- ni's. Besides, Benoni had faithfully followed King David in all his reverses, during the persecutions of the late King, and was, therefore, held in no little repute, both by the peo- ple and their royal head. But, as regarded the time when these espousals might take place, neither Hanani nor Benoni had anything to say. About a year before, Eshton was murdered, and much to the surprise of those to whom he addressed himself, he gave strict injunctions that, in case of his death before his daugh- ter arrived to womanhood, she was in no case to be es- poused till she had fully attained her eighteenth year. The cause of this prohibition none could guess, for, when ques- tioned, Eshton gloomily refused to- give any reason for it, but only still further pressed the importance of strictly ad- hering to his wishes. It was probably the effect of some superstitious fear, for it was whispered that he had once or twice been known to confer with those who had familiar spirits. However, the fact remained. The injunction of the dead father must be respected, and Heber and Athaliah must wait two years, for she was now sixteen, before the espou- sals could take place. One of these years had sped happily by at the time the scene related in the preceding chapter took place. The dis- aster occasioned by the hurricane, none would acknowledge had any reference to the separation of the rings, and yet not   THE ROSE ANb THE PEARL.  one concerned in that transaction but feared in their hearts that there might be some connection, which would still fur- ther develop itself as time went on. A month later the simple marriage ceremony took place that made Elnathan and Rebekah man and wife. They made their residence in Benoni's house, and thus, for the first time in their memories, the cousins were separated. When they were together, one maid had served them both about their persons. This maid chose to remain with Atha- liah. Soon after Rebekah's marriage, Rizpah (introduced by Hannah, who highly recommended her; from what mo- tives it is easy to conjecture, for one false step is sure to follow another,) applied for the position of serving-maid, and, after a little deliberation, was accepted. Rizpah was not long in ingratiating herself with her new mistress, and completely winning her confidence. There are matters, sometimes, occurring in one's life, which pride forbids mentioning to an equal, but which are very apt to find their way to the ear of an inferior, whom duty requires to be near' in moments of retirement. Such was the case with Rebekah. When speaking to Athaliah, Elnathan was the best of husbands; she, the hap- piest of women. But Rizpah heard pettish complaints from her mistress--that her husband appeared fonder of looking after his sheep, than staying at home with his wife. But the subtle serving-maid was not long in learning that such- complaints sprang from wounded pride, not love; and that, if Heber had stayed at home, Elnathan was welcome to stay away. Rizpah never lost an opportunity of extolling the merits of Heber; and they were not lacking, for Rebekah evi- dently loved to listen. One day, she ventured to say to her mistress: 4"Ah! if thou hadst only married Heber!" And Rebekah had betrayed the weakness of replying, with a sigh: "If I only had!" But Rizpah ventured much too far, when she soon after alluded to the singularity of the Jewish law, which required a brother to marry his sister-in-law, whose husband had died leaving no children; adding: "Such a law would never answer in my country "     274          ATHALIAH.             , A sharp rebuke from Rebekah, and an order to leave her presence, was the reply. And yet the seed was sown, and Rizpah knew it. Not that she imagined her mistress could ever be brought even to connive at her husband's death, or tolerate for an in- stant his murderer; all she required for the present further- ance of her dark, deep-laid plans, was for Rebekah to covet Heber. No other expression serves so well to show the growing feeling in Rebekah's heart, and which her serving- maid was so industriously laboring to strengthen and de- velop. CHAPTER IV. DAYS OF MOURNING, Six months have now elapsed since the marriage of Elna- than and Rebekah, and the wife has suddenly become a widow. Elnathan's sickness lasted but three days, and did not excite great apprehension till a few hours before he breathed his last. He had then fallen into a deep stupor, from which nothing could arouse him, and from this stupor, he had passed into the forgetfulness of the grave. Rebekah's grief was not assumed, but mingled largely with it was remorse that she had been, though not in act, yet in intent, a faithless wife. A few days after the funeral she had an interview with Benoni, in which she declared her intention of visiting her old nurse, who lived in a very retired spot in the mountains of Naphtali. Her father-in-law at once coincided with her in this decision, for he felt how much more proper it was for her to spend the days of her mourning Dthere than in the house where abode one who might become her future husband. At first it had been Rebekah's intention to leave Rizpah behind, and take another maid with her. But the serving- maid had pleaded so hard to be with her afflicted mistress in her sorrow, that Rebekah had relented and taken her with her. Three men-servants conducted them on their journey, which was not free from peril, but they arrived safely at    DAYS OF MOURNING.        275ll their place of destination on the fifth day after leaving Gibeah.   Rebekah's grief, as may readily be supposed, was of  short duration. It was, at the best, but counterfeit, though  she had been sincere in its expression. But when she first  began to think of Heber, even before Rizpah had ventured   to make; any allusions that way, she found that he was still beyond her reach. It is unnecessary to trace the temptations artfully thrown; in Rebekah's way by Rizpah, day after day, and week after week. At first Rebekah recoiled from the proposition made, in carefully-guarded language, by her serving-maid. Soon after, her objections related not so much to the enormity of the sin, as to the great difficulty, almost impossibility, of ac- complishing it, till at length it came to pass that the subject was freely discussed, plans laid and provisions made for carrying out what Rebekah had at first shrank from with horror. Rizpah evinced a zeal in the matter which ought to have excited her mistress' suspicion and distrust, but she blindly attributed it all to Rizpah's great love for her. She was so fertile in resources, so cunning in expedients, that Re- bekah began to lose all fear of detection and consequent  disgrace; and when her conscience smote her for thus dis-  honestly contriving to defraud Athaliah of her lover, Riz- pah, who seldom left her now, would paint such scenes of  happiness to come as to make her quite forget all else, and  content to dream away the passing hours.  The love Rebekah's old nurse bore her was so devoted, that she hesitated not a moment in lending herself to any-  thing that would further the happiness of her beloved fos- ter-child. Her age, and the solitude in which she lived,  rendered her a fit recipient of a secret, the guarding of  which was so indispensable to Rebekah's future welfare.  When Rebekah's child was born, she lay as unconscious  of its existence as its dead father coldly sleeping in the grave. All the nurse's anxiety and care was for the mother, and thus the poor infant had none to bestow a thought upon it but the woman who was plotting against its mother a   vengeance worse than death, and in which it was to be in- volved. heroi' Some hours after Rebekah's return to consciousness,  Hi "i     Z 76        ATHALIAH.              i consciousness which, however, consisted in dreams, for she was sleeping, Rizpah returned and whispered to the nurse that the child had died before she had reached the woman's house in whose charge it was to be placed, and that she had buried it. "What was it?" enquired the nurse, in low tones. "A boy," was the whispered reply. "Thou wilt break the tidings to its mother?" and Riz- pah glanced towards her sleeping mistress. "Yes; but it is better as it is," responded the old nurse with a sigh, " and I hope it will not be long ere my dar- ling is her own happy self again. Ah! how   different was her birth from this!" CHAPTER V. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING. BEFORE returning with Rebekah to her home near Gibeah, it will be necessary to follow the footsteps of Riz- pah on the eventful night she bore away with her the infant whom she falsely reported as having died soon after its birth. The moon was at its full, and shining through the clear mountain air with strength that seemed rivalling the day. Along the solitary road Rizpah was pursuing, it was un- necessary to take any precautions, even where secrecy was so indispensable; still she was not unprepared, for when her quick eye observed a female figure coming towards her, she drew a veil over her face, and, placing the sleeping in- fant under the folds of her dress, so as to attract the least attention, proceeded on her way, wondering as to the object the approaching form could have at such a time and in such a place. Rizpah started as she recognized an acquaintance in this woman. She might have passed her easily without being known, but a thought flashed through the active mind of the wily Arab that she might make a profitable use of this chance encounter and she therefore determined to accost her.   AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.      277 'J "What, Milcah! Thou here?" 4' Yes, Rizpah," was the reply, uttered with a trepidation that was owing to something else than mere surprise. "Thou recognizest me very easily, Milcah!" "Yes, by thy voice; I cannot easily forget that," moodily replied Milcah. "But what art thou doing here; and at such a time of night?" enquired Rizpah. "I might ask the same question of thee," rejoined Milcah, gaining courage on reflection. "And I might answer thee, if thou wouldst make the confidence mutual?" responded Rizpah, and then added in lighter tones: 6"Come, come, Milcah, we have holpen each other before, and may do so again " "Rizpa-h, I do not need thy help, but have no objection in telling thee that I am on my way to the house of Aha- ziah." "Ah! I see!" exclaimed the Arab woman; "thou still art pursuing thy old occupation!" "And thou, too, seemest to be somewhat in that line!" laughingly replied Milcah, now thoroughly reassured, for at that moment the infant Rizpah was concealing awoke and commenced crying. Rizpah was thus forced to make some explanation: "It is a child I am taking to its nurse; its mother does not care to bring it up." Milcah replied with a significant nod. Rizpah, in order to quiet the infant, commenced walking. "I must go, now; I ought not to have waited so long," said Milcah, moving off. Rizpah had no idea of yet losing sight of her, so she went along with her. "What is the woman's name thou art going to attend?" asked the Arab woman, with a savage abruptness, that seemed to overawe the midwife. "Naomi, was the prompt reply. "And who is this Ahaziah?" asked Rizpah, still using the same stern, determined manner. "The brother of the famed Naaman," replied Milcah, with much hesitation. "Not the Naaman who was travelling in Egypt when we  278     -    ATHALIAH.  were last there?" exclaimed Rizpah, forgetting in her sur- prise to maintain the determined manner she had lately adopted. "The same. It was through his recommendation I was called in to attend Naomi." The -veil with which Rizpah still covered her face pre- vented her companion from noting the changes that passed over her features when she made this discovery. A scornful laugh and quickened footsteps were the only tokens discernible of Rizpah's feelings. Milcah's face crimsoned when she heard the laugh; whether from shame or anger, was doubtful; but if from the latter cause, she did not venture further to express it. After a few moments of silence, Rizpah demanded: "Is this the first child?" "No, the second;" was the submissive reply; 1" the first was born many years ago, and is now a man." "There is unusual danger, I believe, in cases like this?" "Yes," replied Milcah, uneasily, wondering what Rizpah intended by her strange questions. "Thou wilt, then, need an assistant; I will go as such!" coolly added Rizpah. "Impossible!" exclaimed the startled Milcah. "Not as lacking thy consent," tauntingly replied Rizpah; "a few words whispered in the ear of the husband of this Naomi would procure thee a pretty speedy dismissal from the house." "But the child in thy arms? Oh! Rizpah! have some little mercy on me, and let me go on my way quietly!" pleaded the terrified Milcah. "I will take care that this child does not betray us by its crying. Thou canst leave me in some adjoining room." "Thou wilt ruin me!" exclaimed the agitated midwife, wringing her hands. c"Milcah!" and Rizpah spake in stern and decided tones, "Iisten to me. Obey me in this matter, and no harm shall come to thee. I will soon leave this part of the country never to return, and will see thee no more. But disobey me, and I will, as my soul liveth, and as thy Lord liveth, hurl on thee a ruin without remedy." "I will obey thee!" gasped out the timid and easily-ter- rified Milcah; " but oh, Rizpah, be cautious!"    PRIDE.           279  "Never fear me," replied, Rizpah, in milder but still de- cided tones. "Recollect thou must introduce me into the house as quietly as possible, as thy assistant, in case thou shouldst need one. Then bring the infant to me imme- diately, before it is seen, or its sex known. Thou under- standest?" and Rizpah pronounced the last two words with such significance that a sudden light flashed on Milcah's mind, and she exclaimed: "Thou surely dost not intend to change the infants? "I intend that the child I hold in these arms shall be reared as the son of Ahaziah!" replied Rizpah, in clear, de- termined tones, for she saw that the proposed exchange could not be made without the knowledge and assistance of the midwife.  "There is nothing so very terrible in this," she proceeded, endeavoring to re-assure the terrified Milcah. "Naomi's child may be still-born; better, then, to give to the parents a living infant than a dead one. It may be a daughter, and thou well knowest how much greater thy reward will be if thou announcest to the father the birth of a son. Besides, Milcah, I have a purse of gold that I will give thee if our plan succeeds." Milcah saw no way of extricating herself, and, if the truth must be told, the prospect of gain, so cunningly held out to her, pretty nearly reconciled her to Rizpah's hazardous scheme. Still she trembled and hesitated; not at the sin she was about to commit, but from fear of detection and consequent punishment. Rizpah managed, however, to quiet her as to this fear; and by the time they reached the house, Milcah had regained her composure, and was ready to carry out the iniquitous scheme proposed. CHAPTER VI. PRIDE. THE plan succeeded. Naomi's daughter was exchanged for Rebekah's son, and soon after Rizpah conveyed the former to Mileah's house, there to await the midwife's re-    turn. They had first met near Milcah's dwelling, and thus she found little difficulty in directing the quick-witted Arab woman where to find it. While Rizpah is thus waiting, quieting as best she could the little one, who had been taken from its own mother's bosom to make place for the son of a stranger, it will be necessary to explain the relationship that existed between Rizpah and Milcah, and which gave her so much power over her. The first time they ever met was in Egypt, about four years previous to the time we are now considering. Milcah had gone thither, ostensibly, to improve herself in the knowl- edge of the profession she had adopted as a means of sup- port, but in reality to more fully gratify a craving she had always felt for the power, no matter how obtained, of peer- ing into the future, or laying bare the secrets of the past and present-a thing forbidden in her own land under heavy penalty, but which in Egypt had long been regarded as a science. Rizpah, though at this time but twenty-fiveayears of age, was an adept in the art of soothsaying, or, in other words, in the art of imposition. She could read character readily and correctly, which, for her purpose, was much more effe ct- ive than the scanning of stars, or scrutiny of the smoking entrails of animals. She understood many of the technicali- ties of the art, and had never failed in impressing on the minds of her applicants a high impression of her knowledge and skill. Thus these two women met; the one eager to be duped. the other none the less ready to grasp at all means of ac. complishing the one great object of her life. It was not long ere the wily soothsayer had made herself thoroughly ac- quainted with whatever was worth knowing in Milcah's history, and had formed a very correct estimate of her character. Rizpah had learned very minutely the circumstances which led Milcah to Egypt, and the incidents of her jour- ney, the main one of which was destined to exert a power- ful influence on the Arab's future course of action. This event was the meeting of Milcah with the caravan of Naaman, a wealthy Jew, travelling with his three sons to Egypt. He had kindly invited her to join their party and   continue her way with them, as being a much safer and more convenient way of proceeding than the humble course she had been pursuing. Rizpah, by repeated questionings of Milcah, had obtained a very correct appreciation of this family. Naaman had lost his wife many years before, and his three sons were all that remained of a once numerous fam- ily. He had one master-passion that controlled all his thoughts and actions, and would have laid its iron hand on the best affections of the heart, had they run counter to its ruthless purpose. Happily this had not yet occurred, and, in the case of the two elder brothers, did not seem likely to happen, for they were as much under the control of the pas- sion as their father. The younger son was made of milder qualities. He was the sole inheritor of his mother's gentle, loving nature. This master passion, that so swayed Naaman and his two sons, was excessive pride of country and family. To the humblest Jew, Naaman would ever extend the hand of aid and friendship, for each could trace in unbroken lineage, name by name, family by family, generation by generation, their descent from Abraham, the father of Multitude, and thence up to the Parent of the Human Race. The dawning of that day that lent such unparalleled lustre to the reign of Solomon was already perceptible. Not the cold gray tint that appears as the first harbinger of the coming glory of the king of light; but the bright rosy flush that catches its hues from the very ante-chamber of royalty itself. To a mind constituted as his was, it was a delightful oc- cupation to picture the glories of the coming age. Thus not only the past, but the future, lent its influence to in- tenllsify a passion which even amid his country's disaster and reverse would have been all-controlling. Ready and kind hospitality and assistance, in every form, to the humblest, the meanest of his race, and a hearty zeal and unqualified devotion in the service of his religion, is the bright side of the medallion; the reverse exhibits the repulsive picture of a haughtiness and asperity that often merged in injustice to all who could not lay claim to Jew- ish birth, or who at least would not show their appreciation of the Great Nation by desiring to become a proselyte to its religion.     "OVE.   When Milcah had first mentioned the name of the head of this family, it had occasioned but little interest to Riz. pah; but when enquiry had elicited the fact that Naaman was of the tribe of Naphtali, and the brother of Ahaziah, there appeared an eagerness in her manner which the craft of the wily soothsayer was powerless to conceal. Milcah wondered at this sudden interest, but when, after much planning, an interview had taken place between Hez. ron, the youngest son of Naaman, and Rizpah, she naturally imagined that they mayhap had met before, and that this was but an accidental resumption of old associations and feeling, and that the simple solution of the mystery lay in a single word-love. It looked so. Rizpah had not simply beauty of face, but of figure and motion. Hers was no soft and gentle nature retiring into shade, requiring to be sought ere won. She had all the impulsive passion and weird beauty of the love- liest of her race; and when craft threw over all this a dreamy haze, that seemed to speak of the presence of some gently subduing feeling in the heart, it is easy to see how Hezron would fall a victim to such an artful semblance of love! Yes, in spite of all the teachings of his proud but fond father, he had allowed himself to become infatuated with this daughter of a hated, despised race. In their case the ordinary position was changed: Rizpah was the suitor, Hezron the sought. Little he suspected this, for when he first breathed into her ear the assurance of his love, and witnessed the trembling, shrinking manner in which the announcement was received, he thought he had been too bold. Certainly too precipitate! Rizpah had sighed, it was true, but had whispered of obstacles that, might never be over- come-of his father's pride, and of her own too, for she could regard no nation or people as superior to her own. But Egypt was not destined to be the scene for the con- summation of this affair. It was abruptly broken off by the sudden departure of Naaman for his mountain home in the portion of Naphtali. The motives that had induced Rizpah to make the ac- quaintance of Hezron as the fittest instrument of her dark purposes seemed to be but secondary, and rather seized   upon as something fortune had thrown in her way; for on his departure from Egypt she made no effort either to follow or trace him. The road leading to the one fixed object of her life lay elsewhere. Pursue it she must. Again had they mysteriously been brought together, and when Milcah had told her of this proximity, Rlizpah had hailed the intelligence with savage delight, and darkly determined that this time there should be a consummation of her object. Strange inconsistency! Even while planning these dark designs, that boded something more terrible than death to the objects of her revenge, she watched over the infant she had purloined with something of a mother's tenderness. CHAPTER VII. "OVE. RIZPAH, on Milcah's return, soon made herself acquainted with all the facts important for her to know of Naaman and his family. She pushed her enquiries so particularly about the locality of the house and its surroundings, that the poor nurse easily divined it was Rizpah's intention to resume the stolen interviews she had managed to obtain with Hezron in Egypt. Would the wily Arab succeed as well as she did there in keeping these intended meetings secret from the rest of the family? was a question Milcah tremblingly asked herself. Her fears were such that she reiterated her oft-repeated warning: "Oh! Rizpalih! be cautious! Thou wilt ruin thyself, as well as me." "Why, Milcah! how timid thou hast grown! Thou wert less fearful in Egypt! Come, tell me-dost ever see the hlandsome Hezron? and does he ever enquire for me?" "Alas! yes!" hesitatingly replied Milcah. She wished to give Rizpah as little incentive as possible in her hazard- ous scheme. And then she quickly added: "But, methinks, Hezron has some one else to think of now-his fair sister,   284         ATHALIAH I Adah; but only a sister by adoption, and they say that Naaman would be glad to see them marry." "Ah! there is then an Adah in the case?" musingly re. plied Rizpah. "That complicates matters somewhat. But, Milcah, where was this adopted sister when the family were in Egypt? I neither saw nor heard of her there." "She remained at Naaman's house, in company of his mother, who was too aged to undertake the journey." "So, thou thinkest that Hezron loves this pretty Adah?" enquired Rizpah. i' I do not say that. He must feel some affection for her, for she is very beautiful, and they are often seen wandering around the garden together." "Milcah, I must see Hezron to-morrow!" The intensity of Rizpah's tones startled the nurse, so different were they from the light raillery of the preceding conversation. "Did, then, Rizpah love the handsome, gentle youth? Had she aroused her jealousy? and would her unpetuosity disregard the many precautions it would be necessary to use in order to preserve secrecy?" These were the questions Milcah asked herself, and she could not but fear unhappy results. Again, therefore, she tried to intimidate Rizpah. "Rizpah! Naaman, when aroused, is a fearful adversary, and nothing would so excite his anger as to discover a son of his meeting with and loving a woman of a strange na- tion. He has great influence, too, and could easily ensure thy destruction - " Milcah ceased speaking, for she saw on Rizpah's face an expression of hate and anger so intense that she divined at once that there was no question of love here; for if she loved the son, she would never have greeted the mention of the father thus. There was silence for a few moments. At length Rizpah enquired the best means of securing an interview with Hez- ron. Her tones were calm, but there lay a fixedness in them that admitted of no resistance. Milcah soon saw that in order to control in any way Rizpah's movements, she must consent to aid her. The un- happy woman had fondly hoped that, when the exchange of the infants had been safely made, her trials were over. Alas! they seemed only to have commenced!   "OVE.          285 Owing to her folly in seeking an intimacy with Rizpah in Egypt, and winking at, if not actually aiding her in her meetings with Hezron, which Milcah looked on but as an innocent little romance, she was forced now, as it were, knowingly, to further projects, which she had too great reason to suppose would only end in disaster, and perhaps death. She hardly dared ask herself the reason of Rizpah's savage look, when Naaman's name was mentioned; dared not look ahead at what might be the results of her former imprudence, or her present wilful complicity in the Arab woman's designs. After some further conversation, it was settled upon, that Milcah, under some pretext, was to gain speech with Hezron, inform him of Rizpah's proximity, and arrange an interview in some suitable spot where they might meet without chance of discovery. Up6n Rizpah's departure she menacingly reminded Milcah that if she should prove false to her, in the smallest partic- ular, she would become her implacable enemy; but that, if she aided her, she might be sure of something even more valuable than her friendship. It was arranged that Rizpah should return to Milcah's house the next day to learn the result of her endeavors. Milcah, when left alone, had one faint hope to cheer her. It was that Hezron might have forgotten Rizpah, or at least thought only of her in an indifferent way. But when she managed to see him, the next day, this hope was rudely dis- pelled. At the first mention of Rizpah's name his color came and went, and he seized Milcah's hand as if she had mentioned Paradise to him, instead of a woman of a strange nation and holding a menial office. So eager was he, indeed, to see Rizpah,-that when he heard that she was to call at Milcah's house that day, he insisted upon it that he should meet her there; and then, passing suddenly from impetuosity and command to humble entreaty, pleaded like a child for the coveted blessing. Milcah consented, for, on reflection, she could think of no safer or better place of meeting, and though discovery there would terribly implicate her, she was so touched with pity for Hezron that for the time she forgot herself. How could any woman witness such infatuation unmoved? Hezron, the son of a Jewish noble; Rizpah, a servant, of a strange nation,     286          ATHALIAH.  and full of terrible mysteries! while the youth she had so beguiled was as frank and generous-hearted as she was dark and plotting. Did the charm that Rizpah exerted over Hezron, then, lay only in her dark, speaking eye, her lithe form, her springing step, or was there some potent spell she had summoned to her aid? Was it her beauty, God-given, or foul witchery be- stowed by Satan, that was luring Hezron on? Thus Milcah questioned herself, and she quieted her conscience by the hope that, after all, Rizpah might love Hezron, and that he might reclaim her. In the meantime she would watch. She would become Hezron's ally. A foolish and timid sheep was going to protect a lamb against a ravenous wolf, who had the cunning of the fox! An unhappy combination for the lamb! CHAPTER    VIII. THE END ACCOMPLISHED. HEZRON reached Milcah's dwelling before the arrival of Rizpah, and impatiently awaited her. It was in Milcah's mind several times, during this interval, to attempt to check the impetuosity of the young man, by bidding him be on his guard against the wiles of the beautiful Arab girl. But fear, and a lack of confidence in the use of such precautions, restrained her. Consummate was the skill with which Rizpah, upon en- tering the room and beholding its inmates, converted the start of surprise occasioned by Hezron's presence into a gesture of modest hesitation; and by the softening and casting down of her dark eyes, changing the rising color in her cheek, which was but a flush of triumph at this rapid progress of her plans, into the blush of maidenly purity and grace. As the scene opened, so it progressed. On the one side, love, sincerity, devotion; on the other, apparently the same; but Milcah too well knew that it was hypocrisy, deceit, destruc- tion. But what could she accomplish against such a crea-   THE END ACCOMPLISHED.       287 ture as Rizpah? Her own destruction, perhaps, if she chose to combat her! She therefore weakly resolved to shut her eyes and float blindly on the current of hurrying events. Easy to surmise that the meetings of Hezron and Rizpah followed each other rapidly! Two mighty passions urged them on-Love and Hate. And yet there were moments when even Milcah would have doubted, could she have been present. It hardly seemed possible to repay such wealth of love and purity as Hezron manifested, with deceit and in- jury. There must be in her some pity, if not tenderness; some little compassion, if not love. There appeared, too, at times, a wavering of purpose in Rizpah-a hesitation which, alas! was only momentary. But, whatever her designs, something beyond her reach was about to interfere and give a sudden consummation to her most ardent wishes. The gardens of Naaman were of some extent, and much labor had been expended upon them. Hezron was desirous of showing Rizpah the beauties of his father's domain-de- sires, however, very much tempered by the fear of his father's terrible anger, should he discover his intercourse with the stranger. Yet there were spots where they were compara- tively safe from intrusion. One of these places was a summer-house of rock, partly natural, and partly the work of art. From its rugged arches, half-concealed by clambering vines, could be seen a wide extent of country, luxuriant valleys laced with silver streams, glimpses of Lebanon's white crests, and levelling the distant horizon the blue and tranquil waters of the Great Sea. It was on a clear and beautiful morning, about a month after their first meeting, that Hezron and Rizpah sat together in the summer-house. How a single moon had changed Hezron's purposes and hopes, though his love was stronger now than then! He had hoped, he had purposed, to make Rizpah a proselyte to his religion, and then win the sanction of the father to the love and happiness of the son. The Arab girl was not long in showing him how vain were such hopes and purposes concerning her. Gently, yet with thrilling accent, she related what she deemed the glory of her nation and her race ; and with eyes in which were min- gled the fire of- the enthusiast with the devotion of the mar-   288          ATHALIAH. tyr, she declared she would never prove recreant to the simple faith of her fathers. Hezron was too much in love to enquire particularly what that simple faith might be. He had thought when absent from Rizpah, that Ishmael was, after all, the son of Abraham, and although not the son of the promise, yet one on whose head had rested God's blessing; and he came to have a vague idea that the simple faith Rizpah talked so charmingly about, might be as pure and upright as he deemed its fair champion to be. Though Hezron had seen thus scattered around him the wreck and ruin of his fond purposes, he resigned himself to the lulling pleasures of the passing hour, drifting idly, yet gently wafted on the ocean of his love. He heard no note of warning, saw no peril in his course, but drifted, drifted on. Not only had Hezron given up all idea of making Rizpah a proselyte to his religion, but he had tranquilly listened to hopes she had breathed into his soul that he would re- nounce his faith for hers. Such suggestion did not startle him, for it came winged with gentleness and love. As well might he expect to find poison in the pure mountain air, toy- ing with his clustering hair, and kissing his cheek, as to des- cry danger in Rizpah's words! Was it by what men call " accident," or " chance," that Rizpah recurred more openly to this subject on this particu- lar morning? "Ah! dear Hezron!" were the words of the temptress, "why longer defer the day of parting? Thou knowest we must part! The noble lady I serve will ere long leave the mountains of Naphtali, and I must go with her." "Oh! Rizpah! speak not thus! We must not part! I cannot live without thee!" The practiced ear of the Arab girl caught the sound of approaching footsteps. "And can I, Hezron?" Electrical were the tones in which these words were ut- tered. Rizpah gently repelled the embrace which was about to follow them, and continued: s"For both our sakes, dear Hezron, I look the inevitable future in the face, and that future frowningly cries ' Part!' There is no union between the Arab and the Jew."   THE END ACCOMPLISHED.   289   Nearer draw the footsteps, and Rizpah believes the sum- mer-house to be their goal. "Rizpah! dear Rizpah! this must not, shall not separate us! Thou art mine, and I will never give thee up!" A fluttering shadow on the sunlit ground without, revealed the near approach of some one; the deadened sound of a staff striking the earth tells of age, and Rizpah judges it to be the father-knows it is, when she sees by the shadow that the last words of Hezron have been heard, recognized, wondered at! The form has paused, though the fluttering motion continues as of a robe shaken in the wind, and arms are upraised as if' in astonishment or rage! In the interval between, two hearts throb, so quick is though intensified by passion, Rizpah had discovered a way of embroiling father and son, even to deeds of violence- had glanced along a path over which her fleet feet would carry her to safety when the shock came, which she rightly conjectured would wreak its first fury on Hezron.  "Oh! Hezron! this is madness! Thou knowest well that thy father would never consent that his son should wed a daughter of a strange nation. I have heard that one bear- ing my name was content to accept from the kingly Saul a less honorable title than wife; but, dearly as I love thee, Hezron, highly as I cherish that pure affection thou hast so richly lavished on me, wert thou king of seven Israels, and thought to offer me less than thy right hand and whole heart, I would turn away from thee, welcoming death, spurning dishonor!" "Rizpahll I beloved of my soul!" excitedly exclaimed Hezron, "never! God is my witness did I think, even for a moment, to offer thee less than that which thou so richly deservest. I have been a child, a dreamer, but shall be so no longer! I renounce my religion! Teach me, dear Rizpah, thine; I am no longer a Jew! I spurn the name for one worthier, that of-" A rushinfl sound a howl of rage, and Hezron falls be- neath his father's blow! In falling, his head had struck against a sharp projection of rock, producing a fearful wound, empurpling the ground, paling with ashy hue the face, and counterfeiting the immobility of death  shriek, the rustling of a female's dress, and Adah enters! She had seen Naaman in the distance, and had sauntered 13   290          ATHALIAH. hither, thinking to cheer the old man's solitary walk. On nearing the summer-house she had heard voices. Oh! how well, how dearly known were the tones of the one. She had paused on a spot unseen by the father, and had, while listen- ing, experienced that laceration of heart in which love and jealously give a deeper wound than pride;-had been flung on the scene, her dead love revivified, to save, if possible, the treasure she had lost, even though it were to bestow upon another!                         I Too late! '  But the sight that seemed to petrify Naaman, gave to her a new, a suddenly acquired energy. Seizing the again uplifted arm of the old man, as if fearing further violence, though that arm was already paralyzed, she exclaimed: "Father! thou hast killed thy son!" The sense of hearing thus joined its evidence to that of seeing. The icy fabric of his pride suddenly fell away, and he sank prostrate beside his lifeless son. Adah, without casting so much as a glance at Rizpah,  a knelt beside the insensible form of Hezron and raised his pallid head, pillowing it upon her bosom, wildly praying its warm, throbbing life might pass to him, and leave her ob-  livious to all earth's pains and woes for ever!  Oh! Rizpah! what is thy secret? what the fell purpose of thy vengeance, that thou canst gaze upon a scene of  M wreck and ruin such as this, unmoved? Nay more! canst gloat over it as one that brings sweet triumph to thy bitter soul!  CHAPTER IX.              THE PURSUIT.            1 THEEBR come the sounds of hastening foot-treads, and Riz- I pah turns and flies along the path she had designed thr flight, light as the roe upon the mountains. Jahziel and Bela, the brothers of Hezron, and Reuben, the son of Ahaziah, enter the summer-house. As from feelings of filial affection Adah had been drawn to- wards Naaman, so from impulses still more powerful had Reu-   THE PURSUIT.         291 ben followed the fair girl, but lingeringly and at a distance, as one who loves without return. Her shriek had quickened his footsteps into rapid flight, and seeing Hezron's brothers as he ran, he beckoned them towards the goal he was pur- suing. They reached the summer-house together. To their gesture of surprise and horror, Adah answered by simply pointing down the path Rizpah had taken, whose flutter- ing garments were still visible. The brothers hastened after her, and Reuben could do no less than follow, for Adah's gesture admitted but of one interpretation for all three. Such prompt pursuit was not what the Arab girl had counted on, but she had prepared herself for every emer- gency. During the month that had elapsed since her meet- ing with Milcah, and her acquiring knowledge of the prox- imity of Naaman's family consequent thereon, she had made herself acquainted by daily explorations with each path, ravine and torrent of the immediate district. Hence, if her fleetness of foot and powers of endurance equalled those of her pursuers, the advantage was on her side. This she did not doubt, though a stake mightier in her eyes than life itself depended on the race. A turn in the path soon placed her out of sight. This was of the greatest use to her; for before Reuben and the brothers could reach this turning, she would arrive at a point where two ways offered themselves, the one turning to the right, and running along close by the brink of a nar- row ravine, in whose rocky bed surged a rapid torrent, while the other led in a partly opposite direction, down to this same torrent, where the banks, though precipitous, were but a  few feet above the water. Rizpah had before this discovered a place where this mountain stream could be forded, if not with absolute safety, yet with a fair probability of success. She conjectured that her pursuers would natu- rally turn to the right, and, without hesitating a moment, she hurred on to the left. She crossed in safety the turbulent water, and then pur- sued a path which ran along the opposite side of the ravine to that which she had supposed the brothers and Reuben would take. Soon she paused, not to take breath, but to glance through the underwood, for she had reached a point where she could see the way her pursuers would take. A smile of triumph showed they had taken the one she had i,     292          ATHALIAH. avoided, and now each hastening step is only separating them still wider from the object of their pursuit, though but a narrow chasm separates them, but that chasm is passable only for the birds that fly in the open firmament of heaven. Rizpah's path is screened by bushes, and, though so near to her, Reuben and Hezron's brothers have not yet seen her She looks ahead, and sees an opening where the two ways, open to view, approach within twenty feet of each othller. A longing to display her triumph, and excite still further the rage and disappointment of her enemies, takes possession of her. Drawing carefully around her features a veil so as entirely to conceal them, and obeying a deeper, more malicious impulse, by placing on her finger a ring she had about her person, she places herself on the edge of the ravine and attracts the attention of the panting men by a laugh of jeering exultation. They spring towards her, as if they could clear the ravenous depths of the yawning chasm between! Another jeering laugh greets them, and, with a contemptuous wave of the hand, on which flamed and flashed the ring she had taken from the wreck of Benoni's house on the night of the whirlwind, and of which Rebekah and Athaliah each possessed the exact counterpart, Rizpah turns, and is lost to sight as suddenly as she had appeared.  i Jahziel, Bela and Reuben stood transfixed. Eager though they were, further chase was futile. They had each seen the ring, and its flaming tints were fixed upon each brain to be only extinguished by death's cold breath. We have seen how well Reuben remembered it, when he saw its likeness on the hand of Athaliah, a score of years afterwards. Little need be added to this tragical episode of our story. Hezron's wound, and cause still more potent, Rizpah's ab- sence, with anything but hope of her return, brought on a delirious fever, whose ravings were only quieted in the tran- quil chambers of the tomb. Naaman never recovered the shock he had experienced. His pride had been broken, and with it, his house of life soon crumbled away. Adah lived on, if breathing can be called life. Reuben ventured to speak to her of his deep love, and only asked in return the right of protecting her, and winning, in years to come, her affection in return. But she showed him a heart   THE PURSUIT.         293 utterly dead to this world, and said her only hope was that it might blossom in the next. Reuben, in the only interview he ever had with Athaliah, some twenty years later, sternly reminded her of the fate of Hezron's brothers, believing her to be the same mocking demon he had seen for a moment in the mountains of Naphtali. Little did he then think that it was from some mercy in the woman who really committed this double murder, with which he had charged Athaliah, that he did not share the brother's fate; and that the same woman, knowing her to be such, had reared his only sister through infancy and childhood, if not in luxury and with a mother's tenderness, still in purity and honor, allowing her to embrace the tenets of the religion in which she was born, and naming her Zil- lah, as if in something like a pitying remembrance of Adah, for Rizpah was an adept in the sacred writings of the Jews, and had read of the wives of Lamech. CHAPTER X. THE ROBBERY. IT was but a few days later that Rebekah, with Rizpah and the necessary attendants, set out to return to her home near Gibeah; for Benoni was, to all purposes of support and protection, as much her father as if she had been born to him. The little Zillah had been left to the care of Milcah, who had received from Rizpah a sum sufficient to compensate her for such attendance for three years. At the end of this time she was to bring the child to Gibeah, where she would find means of communicating with Rizpah, who would then relieve her of her charge. There was too much guile in the wily hand-maid to allow to appear in her attendance upon Rebekah that feeling of equality which the commission of crime always gives to accomplices. If there was any change, it was in increased     294:         ATHALIAIL, humility and devotion, as if her only aim was that her mis. tress might forget the past, and be happy in the future. Rebekah did not doubt but that her child was dead. A single doubt of that would at once have aroused that feel- ing of maternity which God has planted in every mother's heart, deep, if not deeper, than the mighty passion, love. But during the time that Rebekah had been absent in the mountains of Naphtali, what of Heber and Athaliah? Ask, rather, what of two children playing in a garden of fruits and flowers, utterly heedless of the dark clouds steal- ing on from the horizon, soon to darken their sunny sky, and scatter fruit and flowers far and wide! They counted the moons as they waxed and waned, and said to each other, " the time that separates us from be. trothal and marriage wanes like that moon, but our love, like it, too, waxes stronger. Even Rebekah's return did not arouse these charming egotists of love. They were not scribes or learned doctors of law, and if the dark shadow of that stern statute had fallen on their path, called up by inward foreboding or outer warning, each would have exclaimed: "Rebekah, the sor- rowing widow, will never exact such bitter sacrifice from her sister in all but name!" And so the blow fell with sudden, crushing violence on the lovers. Rebekah's guardian made a formal demand of Benoni for the hand of Heber. What it cost Benoni, for his heart was kind and sympathetic, to command his son to break off all but friendly intercourse with Athaliah, and make ready for his marriage with Rebekah, is known only to the Searcher of the heart. In the execution of that peculiar law, father and mother, son and daughter, shared its anguish in common. Let us hope that the seed of obedience to duty, bitter though it was, was generally sown in a good soil, to spring up and bear fruit in the paradise of God. But there were cases where evil passions made it the vehicle of wild misdeeds. Such an one has our story hitherto traced through all its dark and tortuous windings. Athaliah was the greatest sufferer. Do you ask " why?" Simply because she was a woman! At first, grief and des- pair, in each of the lovers, assumed like lineaments. Less than two years saw them in Heber utterly effaced. In   THE ROBBERY.         295 Athaliah they were as sharp and well defined as ever, not of course to an outward observer, for pride forbade any such manifestation. To her, love had been life. In Heber, the impression had been made on wax; in Athaliah, it had been engraved on the rock. Experience of that grief which lays the loved one in the chill solitude of the sepulchre, is no measure of that wilder anguish of the soul which sees him living in the smiles and love of another; and knowing, too, that such action was not through infidelity to her, but in obedience to a law of the Jewish commonwealth, which gave no alterna- tive but submission or disgrace. There was nothing soothing in the nature of Athaliah's affliction. The affection both of the lover and sister had forsaken her. If she had not yet learned to hate Rebekah, her feelings had still much of hate's bitterness. Though she ceased not to love and yearn after Heber, she was con- stantlv chafed at knowing him to be less miserable than herself. Athaliah was still living at the old home in Gibeah, where she and Rebekah had been reared as sisters. Suitors for her hand were many, for the Pearl of Gibeah was still peerless in grace and beauty; but, though her pride forbade her showing chagrin at being deprived of Heber's hand, and of his growing content with the lot which had been thrust upon him, she had too much soul to chain herself to a man she did not love, merely to gratify a feeling -of spite. No! If her bitter feelings ever got the control of her actions, as they had of her thoughts, she would strike blows less puny, less womanly than this! What dread alchemy is sometimes exercised upon the heart, transforming love to rancorous hate, gentleness to scorn, a child-like faith in human goodness, as a reflex of God, to an unbelief in everything except the potency of evil! Rizpah had frequent occasion to visit Gibeah in the ex-- ecution of commissions for her mistress. She was not long in insinuating herself into the confidence of Athaliah's hand-maid, and of thus learning, through the medium of an apparently idle gossip, on her side, the state of Athaliah's feelings. In exchange, she told of what was going on in Rebekah's     296          ATHALIAH.  house; of Heber's placidity, if not actual happiness; and one day she brought the choice tit-bit of news that a son had been born to the house, who was to be named Ethni at the time of his circumcision. The wily Rizpah knew that this piece of intelligence, at -least, would filter through the porous medium that con- nected her with Athaliah, and that the latter would thus discover the source of her hand-maid's information. This was one point gained. The isolation between Rebekah and Athaliah was so complete, that Rizpah did nor dare even to hint at a formnal announcement of this primely important event in a Jewish household being made to Athaliah, and so the Arab girl made it in the way of servants' gossip. Carefully feeling her way, Rizpah finally came to the con- clusion that the time had arrived when she could openly avow to Athaliah the deceit which had been practiced upon her. It would certainly not lead to any attempt on Athaliah's part to deprive Rebekah of Heber, for the love of the hus- band having extinguished the affection of the lover, such pursuit would lead to no benefit to her, save a gratification of revengeful feelings and Rizpah plotted to give the de- ceived a far more terrible revenge against the deceiver than this. Rizpah, in her acute discernment, had noticed that Rebekah was more the mother than the wife. To assail her, then, though her children, would prove a more effective way than through her husband. Let her retain him, and while she lives on in fancied security and peace, her children, the one living, and him whom she believes dead, shall be lured into circumstances that will break the mother's fbnd and proud heart with anguish. But how was Rizpah to excuse her own connivance in this terrible deceit that had been practiced against Athaliah? or how account for at last breaking a silence she had kept so long? As it was important for her to gain Athaliah's full confidence, this was a point worthy of much consideration. Confidence among accomplices in evil does not presuppose honor, love of truth, or any of the generous motives; but re- lentlessness of purpose, power of shaping means to some corn-   THE ROBBERY.         297 mon end, and fidelity to the cause in hand, let the motive be what it may, black as Satan, or as deep and low as his hab- itation. Thus Rizpah reasoned. She felt that Athaliah's anger would be so concentrated upon Rebekah as to pass over her accomplice or mere tool, as Rizpah intended represent- ing herself. But to assure Athaliah's confidence in her de-' votion as an ally, she deemed it indispensable that she should leave Rebekah's service, and for a reason that would nat- urally make her the bitter enemy of her former mistress. Such pretext the wily Arab girl did not doubt that she could weave from her busy brain. But there were other and greater obstacles. Rebekah must not regard her as her enemy, for then she might take means that would render futile, or at least diminish, the effects of Rizpah's plans. To devise, then, a pretext for leaving her mistress, of such a nature that Rebekah's pride would prevent her ever mak- ing it public, and thus leave Rizpah to put such a construc- tion on it to others as she saw fit; to shape her conduct that she might appear to the eyes of her mistress blameless, and go away from her rather in sorrowing humility than anger, and to so conceal her movements thereafter, that Re- bekah would have no reason to suspect her enmity ; this was the problem the scheming Rizpah set herself to work out. In calculating her resources, it was not likely she would omit the item of her beauty. She had already tested its maddening power, and she smiled bitterly as she scanned form land feature in her mistress's mirror to think that what to others of her sex was the occasion of vanity and display, she only valued as a weapon for her revenge, which she would readily cast aside, if by so doing she could grasp one more potent. One day, while in the garden culling flowers wherewith to adorn the apartment of Rebekah, Rizpah noticed that Heber, in passing, looked at her with a start of something like surprise, as if he had suddenly made a discovery hidden from him before; that he turned his head afterwards, and chanced, as it were, to retrace his steps that way again before her task was completed. "I see my way clear now!" were the unuttered words of Rizpah.     298         ATHALIAH.              . A little study in dress, a rose in her hair, a certain expression of feature, were the simple means used by Riz- pah. The results were these: The next day another meeting in the garden; this time accompanied by some commonplace phrases from Heber, that might pass for words of condescension or kindness of. the master to the servant. The next encounter, casual of course, witnessed some. thing more than words of condescension-an interest in her welfare that called for answers to questions put, that Rizpah gave with modest frankness. Then Heber passes on to compliment the beautiful serv- ing-maid, the only reply to which was a blush and timid shrinking, but nothing like reproach or anger.  - The next day Rizpah kept out of the garden. The one following she went there, but before Heber could reach her she had hurriedly culled some flowers and returned to her mistress. "She avoids me," reasoned Heber, "therefore I must pursue. The current of my desires has been checked; therefore it must well up, overflow, destroy." Such appears to be the logic of men who have no higher rule of action than their own passions; or, having one, fail to live up to it. Rizpah now carefully avoided giving Heber opportunity of speech. She well knew what the burden of his song would be, and she was planning that another beside herself 'l should hear it. Circumstances soon shaped themselves in accordance with Rizpah's wishes. It was her usual time for going into the flower garden, and she therefore knew that Heber would either be awaiting her, or on the watch to join her. Rebekah was standing at an open window of her sleeping apartment, in which lay slumbering the little Ethni, then a year old. Taking up a basket, Rizpah hurried firom the house, but instead of seeking the more sequestered part of the garden, she took care to keep in sight of the window at which Re- bekah stood. A clustering vine screened the wife and the mother from view, but did not prevent her from seeing what passed below her. Heber was not long in joining the wily hand-maid, and   THE DISCOVERY.         299 thus causing his wife to suffer the first pang of jealousy wlhich was none the less keen for being merely introductory. There was no mistaking her husband's gestures. Forget- ting her sleeping infant, she left the house and rapidly pur- suing a path running parallel to the one in which were He- ber and Rizpah, she soon gained an admirable spot both for seeing and hearing, if anything appertaining to the wreck of confidence, if not of love, can be called admirable. Rizpah had adroitly managed time and place. Her keen ear caught a rustling sound, and she knew her plan had suc- ceeded. She did not let Heber go far enough in his vapid protestations to precipitate Rebekah on the scene, but imi- tating the outward act of the virtuous Joseph, she fled into the house, leaving her basket partially filled with flowers behind her. When Rebekah joined her, she was pensively gazing on the cradled and sleeping little Ethni. Position, touching and beautiful! But Rebekah was in no very sentimental mood. Though she did not think that Rizpah had intentionally invaded her rights, still her mind was too much agitated to discriminate nicely, and so the first patterings of the storm fell on Riz- pah's head. Heber's turn would come all in good time! There came a reaction, of course, as far as Rizpah was concerned, and though the primal condition that she should leave the house was adhered to, yet she was dismissed with great kindness and liberality by her mistress. When Heber was called up to the bar of aggrieved mari- tal justice, he evinced an Adamitish spirit, and endeav- ored to shift the blame on the woman. Failing in this, he claimed a momentary madness as his excuse, which he was certain would never return. Rebekah, having removed the exciting cause, was content to accept this plea. CHAPTER XI. THE DISCOVERY. THE time had now come for Rizpah to seek an interview with Athaliah. Having obtained it, she abruptly announced     300          ATHALIAH. that she had for ever left the service of Rebekah, and she conveyed the intelligence in such a heated and hurried man- ner that she at once aroused the attention of Athaliah. Then followed a frank recital of the terrible deceit that had been practiced upon her. Rizpah did not conceal her full complicity, but threw on Rebekah all the odium of being the originator of the plot, while she, the hand-maid, but obeyed the commands of her mistress in assisting her to carry it out. Of course Rizpah said nothing of her actions regarding the family of Naaman, of which Rebekah was entirely igno, rant herself. She also withheld the true cause of her dimis- sal from the service of her former mistress, and only darkly hinted at some deep injury she had received at her hands,' and which she was desirous of avenging. Rizpah did not communicate to Athaliah the knowledge of Heber's weakness, for that would have lessened her hate against Rebekah, as making of less value the treasure she had stolen. It were futile to attempt description of Athaliah's feelings when the lurid light of this intelligence flashed upon her. To the original loss of Heber's love and presence, were now to be added the sufferings of nearly three years, years corn- prising thousands of wretched, miserable hours. She had sup- posed herself the victim of dread circumstances beyond hu- man control, and of a law of more than human origin. It now transpired that she had been the dupe of a treachery and deceit less than human, for it was fiendish. It was the robbery of love and happiness and peace! it was the de- struction in the heart of every gentle virtue, implanting in their stead hate, energized by a fixed determination of re- venge! After the whirlwind of passion, which Athaliah could not or did not care to restrain in the presence of Rizpah, came a calm. But what a calm! The smooth smiling surface of the sea, luring the mariner on until every adjunct of rock below, and tempest above, should unite to ensure his destruction. Her first impulse had been to make Judea ring in its length and breadth with this new phase of wickedness, and to crush at once and for ever her hated rival. "But what then!" whispered the temptress by her side, and true as the echo to the sound her heart answered:   THE DISCOVERY.        301 "Am I, then, a child, to consume in a single enjoyment what by care and frugality may be made to reach through years and yield large increase!" Rizpah, with all her apparent abandonment, as if obeying some angry impulse, had yet carefully felt her way, and had refrained from telling Athaliah that she had deceived Re- bekah in stating that her first-born was dead. But she found Athaliah so apt a pupil, saw that she was so ready to commit herself to any plan that would yield the largest harvest of revenge, that Rizpah hesitated no longer on this point, but boldly avowed that Rebekah's first son still lived, and was being reared as the son of Ahaziah. Her object here was to induce Athaliah patiently to wait, by showing this additional source of power against Rebekah. Athaliah was too intent on the main object to discern any danger to herself from one who had thus deceived her mistress, and for nearly two years after had lived amicably with her. If the thought occurred to her, she accounted for it by the supposition that Rizpah had acted to save her mistress trouble and anxiety, and at the same time secure a good home and an assured future for the little one. From this time, then, Athaliah and Rizpah became allies. While the latter claimed a personal interest in Rebekah's ultimate downfall, she still yielded the supremacy to Atha- liah, as to the one having by far the greater wrong to avenge, and professed to aid her, if not as a servant, still as an inferior, whom, however, a common wrong had in some things made equal. As the course to be pursued, for years- to come, was one of patient waiting, it was neither requisite nor desirable that the plotters should often meet. Whenever Rizpah had any- thing important to communicate, she sought a secret inter- view with Athaliah. When the little Zillah was about eight years old, Rizpah took her to Athaliah's house for the first time, representing her as her daughter. The occasion of this visit was to an- nounce the following facts: Ahaziah, the reputed father of Benaiah, (this was the name that had been given to Rebekah's child,) had recently died. Reuben had entered the army soon after his cousin Hezron's death, and thus the household was completely broken up, the wife of Ahaziah having been dead some years. Benaiah     302          ATHALIAH. 'had been sent to Egypt to pursue his studies, under the care of Ahaziah's sister-in-law. But events of a far more startling nature than these had occurred some years previous to this, the narration of which has been reserved for a separate and concluding chapter. p      CHAPTER XII. A TOTAL LOSS. HEBER had been at first attracted towards Rizpah by an artfully concealed coquettry on her side, as has been already stated. Had no such temptation been thrown in his way, he probably would not have lapsed in fidelity to his wife. Afterfutile excuses, came feigned contrition. Hypocrisy paved the way for other sins. Instead of waiting to be tempted, he sought to tempt others. In a word, he fancied himself, suddenly, very much in love with Athaliah. Allow- ing his thoughts to dwell on her, he began to embrace every opportunity of seeing her. These opportunities, if not frequent, were at least not un- common. Athaliah still lived in the world moving around her. From occasionally meeting in public, Heber at length essayed a meeting where none could hear or see what trans- pired. He succeeded. Athaliah listened to his first few faltering words unmoved, and, taking her silence for complacency, if not acquiescence, he poured into her ears the old story he had so often breathed before. But, lo! the difference! Angels might have listened then, and, listening, smiled approval! but now, these protestations, the same as of old, as far as the mere words went, were yet as different and opposite as light and darkness. Did Athaliah falter in her concerted plan with Rizpah, and think to wreak another and a different kind of vengeance on Rebekah? If so, it was but the weakness of a moment. Pride, the extreme of sin, touched on purity, the extreme of virtue. The simple answer she gave to Heber's passionate outpourings was, that she could not recall any action of her   A TOTAL LOSS.        303 past life which ought to have subjected her to such gross' insult. Rizpah had divined that danger to her purposes would grow out of the old and only half-buried affection of Heber and Athaliah, and she had tarried at Gibeah longer than she otherwise would to watch, and if possible to counteract. She therefore knew of this private interview, but nothing of what had transpired at it. A hint to Athaliah on the subject at once aroused in her all the feeling of superiority she naturally felt over Rizpah. Changed as she was in heart and purpose, Athaliah still kept as in an inner shrine her love for Heber. He was dead to her, and the man who dared pour such pestilential breath into her soul, had none of the lineaments of her lost love! To no one, then, much less to Rizpah, would she lay bare this audacious counterfeit-this phantom, waving its fune- real plume over the grave of her buried hopes. Rizpah, at this reticence of Athaliah, took alarm! Had she repulsed with scorn Heber's unhallowed advances, why not avow it? Was not this haughty silence a tacit acknowl- edgement that she had yielded, or still might yield, and thus combine in one, love and revenge? How combat this obstacle, that seemed replete with so much life and vigor? Should she recount to Athaliah the scene in the garden of Benoni that Rebekah witnessed, with the purpose of disgusting her with the miserable falsity of Heber? But what would avail ler words if those of Heber had already found a lodgement in Athaliah's heart? No! there was a method more efficacious than this, and it was sure and speedy. To apply it well, several steps were necessary: First to convey an intimation to Rebekah, backed with all the circumstantial -evidence her ingenuity could gather, that her husband was renewing the garden scene she had witnessed, only changing time and place, and substituting Athaliah for Rizpah. She succeeded so well that a violent altercation ensued between the husband and wife; accusations and reproaches on the one side, and a determined denial on the other. Circumstances aided the scheming Rizpah. Rebekah, on the watch, detected Heber in efforts he was making to obtain another interview with Athaliah. The storm broke forth     304          ATHALIAH. with increased violence. Rebekah, in the climax of her rage, for she had no further doubts of Heber's guilt, vowed she would be avenged. Benoni accidentally heard this out- break. The preliminaries so satisfactorily arranged, Rizpah hast- ened to pursue her purpose to the bitter end. Acquainted ed with every room and passage in the house, and fearing nothing, even if discovered by the servants, all of whom she intimately knew, she succeeded in secretly possessing herself of Heber's cup. To pour in it a few drops of a color- less liquid, which quickly dried, leaving no stain on the shining metal, was but the work of a few moments. Repla. cing the now fatal chalice in its accustomed place, she left the house unobserved. It was yet early in the morning. Soon after the morning meal, Heber complained of diz- ziness and lassitude; and before the sun had reached its meridian height, a thrill of horror quivered through the household! Heber was dead! His lifeless body had been discovered stretched on a couch in the summer-house. Myra was happily absent on a visit to some friends who dwelt in Jerusalem, and so the crushing weight of this affliction fell at first on Rebekah and Benoni; and heaviest on the wife; for to the loss sustained by her, in common with Benoni, was to be added the dreadful suspicion she felt would attach to her as the author of her husband's death, the father of her little Ethni. Oh! was this the bitter fruit her sin in the mountains of Naphtali was bring- ing forth? nought left but Ethni? And how rid herself of this horrible taint of crime? She shuddered in the inmost depths of her being when ask- ing herself, who could have been the murderer, and heard reason coolly answer, " no one but thyself!" Benoni had heard the rash vow she had taken! Useless, then, to urge her innocence to him! He never spoke to her. His gloomy silence was heavier to bear than bitterest reproach. Immediately after the burial of Heber, he left his native country and travelled in distant lands, to forget if possible the desolation of his house. When Rebekah was apprised of this self-imposed exile, suddenly there flashed on her mind, as if by inspiration of   A TOTAL LOSS.         305 some malignant spirit, the truth that Benoni regarded her as the destroyer of both his sons! And he was gone, none knew whither; and even if she could find evidence to clear herself, what would it avail her! To live longer in that house, the scene of so many bitter remembrances, she felt would be impossible. She there- fore broke up her household, sold the mansion and estate to the nearest male relative of Benoni, though a distant one, and receiving the money in trust for Ethni, the infant in- heritor, she purchased a house in Jerusalem, and made that city her future home. As for Myra, she made earnest efforts to join her father in his wandering life, but he found means to intimate to her firmly, if not with sternness, that for years to come, and mayhap till life's end, he must live alone. He also trans- mitted to her means sufficient for her support, and desig- nated the relative, an aunt residing in Jerusalem, with whomn she was to live. Without assigning any cause for the strange injunction, he forbade her holding any intercourse with Rebekah. It is not likely that Myra ever suspected the crime of which Benoni believed Rebekah guilty. Failing in fulfilling what i   she deemed a daughter's duty, or rather obliged to suppress all effort to that end in obedience to her father's command, when the days of her mourning were ended, and they were sad ones, for she mourned a father's and a brother's loss, she listened to one who finally taught her what love was, and she became a happy wife. But what effect did the sudden death of Heber produce E   on Athaliah? Ah! did that fluttering of the heart, when the news reached her, tell her that love was not yet dead? Had Hope, that subtler element than Faith, then, lingered in her heart when pride had dismissed the lover, and was this sickening, sinking sensation she felt, the extinction of that principle, deathless till what it clings to dies? Who can read the human heart even in its simpler com- binations? Who then tell of its workings, its contradictions, its restless strivings, when grief which softens, and anger which hardens, love which elevates, and hate which ener- gizes to deeds of violence, make it the battle-field of strife, on whose issues hang not merely mortal life or death, but the destinies of the quenchless soul?     BOOK IV. CLOSING' IN. CHAPTER I. IN THE STARLIGHT. IN resuming the course of the narrative, which it was ne- cessary to leave for the time, in order to examine the springs from which it originally flowed, it may now be well to take a rapid glance at the surroundings of the personages of the story at the time the digression was made. Adin:-who had so materially aided Benaiah when led forth to death, now at a loss how to overcome this new and unlooked-for obstacle to the happiness of Benaiah and his sister, for it was very clear that military prowess would avail nothing now. Helem:-with no heart affairs of his own to distract him, makes the troubles of his friend and Miriam his own, and though he sees no way in which success can reach them, still hopes, and does his best to cheer them. Sarah-:--waiting quietly till her days of mourning are ended, and weakly hoping that Benaiah will in time forget Miriam and learn to love her. Zillah:--sadly yet patiently striving to work out a future, which, though it yields not pleasure, will still bring peace as the reward of duty faithfully performed. Rebekah:--proudly grieving over the rupture of all en- dearing relations with her only son, and almost her only treasure in life, and but partially relieved by the hope that a full reconciliation will ere long take place. Ethni:--in the first flush of maturing manhood purpose- less, disgusted with his infatuation, shuddering at the crimes he was ready to commit under its influence, and al-   IN THE STARLIGHT.       307 lowing remorse to eat away an energy that repentance might have directed into a course of future usefulness and peace. Athaliah:-still chafing at the circumstances that im- pelled her to become the savior of Benaiah, and planning he is for ever beyond her reach. Rizpah:-unmoved and confident, soothing Athaliah. with promises regarding Rebekah and her sons, so horrible that no one but the Arch Fiend himself would aid her in fulfilling. Benaiah:--strong in the use of the weapons of the war-, rior, but unskilled in the arms with which only the giant af- flictions of life may be met and vanquished. Miriam:-who, like Moses of old, had ascended from the frg wilderness of earth's sorrows up to the Pizgah-like heights of faith, and is gazing with eye unfaltering and undimmed on the glories of the promised future. The rumors which Benaiah had heard on that sadly event- ful day when the tidings of Reuben's death reached him, that Joab intended to deal an effectual blow at the Philis. tines, who, taking advantage of the late distracted state of the country, had been committing serious depredations on the seaward borders, were well founded. A few days later, or- ders were issued for the immediate organization and equip- ment of an auxiliary force to act in conjunction with the regu- lar army, which at this time was composed almost entirely of the men of Judah and Benjamin. Volunteers were not lacking. Each of the revolted tribes sent numerous representatives; and the Philistines, in thus firing the heart of the Jewish nation with a common im- pulse, were conferring a benefit on the commonwealth which a score of defeats would not serve to eradicate. Among the first who thus hastened to offer their services was Benaiah. All he asked for was a place in the ranks. The pardon which he had received from the King only saved from death; his position in the army it did not restore to him. Joab, who took personal cognizance of this organization, knew of this application. Though a man of violence, even to treachery, he was brave and loyal, and appreciated these qualities wherever found; and though personally he enter-     308         ATHALIAH. tained toward Benaiah no kindly feelings, he sank the an- imosity of theman in the duty he owed his King and coun- try as commander-in-chief, and gave him a commission as captain of a hundred in the volunteer force. Benaiah received this favor with the coldness with which it was tendered. Joab had performed an unpleasant duty in conferring it, and Benaiah in accepting it regarded it as only an honorable method of applying to life's troubles what Helem had called a " fierce remedy "-death. Indications were soon apparent that the Philistines were prepared for a conflict of more than ordinary proportions. Several skirmishes had already taken place, which, if per- severed in, would have eventuated in battles, but the favor- able opportunity each sought had not yet come, and the great conflict was delayed. At length the main bodies of the combatting forces met. This time each commander determined to make it the decisive conflict. But it was at the close of the day, and the oppos- ing armies encamped almost in sight of each other, only waiting for the calm-eyed stars to leave the sky that they might begin their work of carnage beneath the fiery gaze of the sun. The eve of a great battle! How impressive the time, even to those who seek by hilarity and the wine cup to drown everything in the present moment! The grim fea- tures of the coming day will at intervals force themselves unbidden and unwelcome on the gay revelers, and the crash of coming battle re-echo in the chambers of the soul! But to the man who, disdaining such a counterfeit of bravery, has the calm courage to look on what the day of battle may bring to him, or to one who, weary of life's bur- dens, thinks that death may take them away, and so look upon it as a relief, how natural to take, nay how almost impossible to avoid taking, a retrospect of the past life! About to end! What, then, has it been? Benaiah had early excused himself from the scene of rev- elry taking place in the tent of the captain of the thousand to which his company belonged. His plea had been that it was necessary for him to look after his men, to whom had been assigned an advanced and important position. He slowly paced along the outer line of sentries, absently giving the word for the night, "Saul and Gilboa," when chal-   IN THE STARLIGHT.       309 lenged. This watch-word 'had been suggested by King David, with the intention of reminding the Israelites of the disastrous defeat their fathers had met at the hands of the Philistines, that thus they might be nerved to win atoning victory. Sometimes Benaiah, tearing himself from his reflections- would try and determine in the uncertain light the best method of advancing on the foe; but soon, very soon, the instincts of the soldier would yield to the sovereign grief of the man, and he would pass on; but stopping now and then, he would gaze up into the star-lit sky, as if his thoughts were gliding from the past on to the future. How brief, how easily scanned, that past! His childhood in the mountains of Naphtali, with its hardy and exciting sports; the gentle chiding of his mother, lest he should ex- pose himself to danger, and the pride of the father at each childish deed of daring safely and skilfully conducted! The brief, infrequent returns of Reuben, the soldier- brother, the model on which he intended to build his life! His quiet walks with his cousin Adah, the only one who ever experienced quietness with him ; his wonderment at her gentle sadness, and still greater that, though he loved her, after father and mother, next to Reuben, he never saw these two together. Iis little plan to have them marry; its aban- donment when Reuben, laying his hand upon his head, told him he was a soldier, and his country was his wife; his per- plexity when, after all, Reuben did marry, but not Adah; and his relief when telling his cousin of Reuben's offence, 5  she exclaimed, "Oh! I am so glad!" and seemed to feel it very much. Then a darkness which seemed the separating night be- tween waning childhood and dawning youth, the darkness cast by the shadow of Death! Then the journey to Egypt and his life there, a life more of the intellect than the affec- tions, and so passed readily over. The return to his native land! the exultation when child- hood's dream was realized, and he buckled on the armor of the warrior! how love came unbidden, unlooked for, and Miriam arose, filling his house of life with warmth and glad- ness! Lingeringly, Benaiah loitered over this section of the past. The first meeting, the birth of love in the soul, its rapid     U1V          ATHALIAH. growth, its revelation, met with the blissful avowal of re- ciprocal affection! Then, like phantoms, hurry by the battle in the wood of Ephraim; the rescue of Reuben; the scene of betrothal rudely interrupted by accusation, trial, condemnation, and well-nigh death! Then again broad sunshine chasing away all shadows, and love and happiness again flooding the soul with light! Then, when thoughts of the death tidings that dispelled this light, never to be rekindled on earth, stole into Ben- aiah's heart, he lifted his eyes to the stars, hoping it might be lit again in heaven! Benaiah had unconsciously wandered to a part of the en- campment somewhat distant from where his company was on guard, and was about retracing his footsteps, when, as -he turned, he met Ethni face to face! Though Benaiah felt no enmity against him, for the storm that had finally wrecked life's happiness he knew was from above, he was about passing him, thinking that any offer of forgiveness on his part would be valueless unless asked for, when something in the peculiar hesitation of Ethni warned him that a friendly advance would be wel- comed and returned. Instead, then, of passing him in si- lence, he extended his hand and said: "Ethni, this in token that I bear thee no ill will!" The outstretched hand was warmly grasped. "Benaiah! I have been a miserable dupe, and have acted against thee unworthily of a true son of Israel! I ask thy forgiveness." "It is freely granted, Ethni!" and each, obeying sponta- neously an impulse of which they knew not the hidden power, embraced. Thus met- the brothers, unknown to each other as such, in that calm, peaceful, starry night; while around them lay all the elements of mortal strife, awaiting only the coming light to waken into direful activity! When the key-note of two hearts is in unison, harmony ensues. Those dusky forms, gliding along, are holding in- tercourse in which no bitter, selfish feelings enter; both feel that they are through with life, for each has the fearful hope that on the next day's battle-field he will engage in his last conflict with the substances and shadows of earth.   IN THE STARLIGHT.       3" The deep tranq'uillity of the stars looking down upon them has brought to mind what their religion has dimly taught them, that the life which Death seems to terminate, he only separates like a dividing point from the life to come! It was not that Miriam was beyond Benaiah's reach, that Ethni was thus drawn towards him. He felt that after al- lowing such a woman as Athaliah to come between him and his love for Miriam, he was utterly unworthy of her pure virginal regard. Whatever bitterness lurked in his heart was against himself, and such bitterness is the tonic of the soul. Though Benaiah found no great accusation rising up against him in the retrospect of his life, yet was he humbled by the feeling that a power, more than human, htad directed the destinies of his being. The brother, who had saved him from an ignominious death, still proved the means by which an affliction overtook him, so harrowing that it left him nothing in this world to desire or seek after. The remedy of Saul for life's ills they shrank from. They sought death in the path of duty. If it came to them, they felt they could welcome it. If not, they would not compel its approach. Dwelling thus on the past, they failed to note the emer- gencies of the present. They had wandered some little dis- tance beyond the outer lines of the sentinels, when Benaiah, who had more of the instinct and experience of the soldier than Ethni, noticed from the more elevated ground they oc- cupied the movement of a dark mass approaching them, over whose surface lay here and there soft glimmerings of light. In low and hurried tones he exclaimed: "That body of men are advancing on our lines for a night assault! It is not large enough for- anything more than a skirmish, and, therefore, I fear it is only intended as a di- version for an attack in force from another quarter. Do thou acquaint Joab with this, and I will arouse a sufficient number of our men to repel this movement!" A momentary hesitation on Ethni's part, as if he felt loth to leave Benaiah; a hearty embrace, as of those who part and may never meet again; and they hastily separated, and were soon lost to each other's vision in the dim starlight. As Benaiah hurried towards the camp of the Israelites, at the point towards which the Philistines were silently     312         ATHALIAH. marching, while Ethni had diverged to reach more readily the tent of the commander-in-chief, he marked out the proper course of action to pursue, in order to secure every advantage this fortunate discovery placed in their power. His plan was simply this: To have the sentinels fall back quietly, prepare an ambush, and thus the first intimation the enemy would receive that their advance was known, would be a vigorous onslaught in front and flank. His fear, and a very natural one, too, was that the outposts would decline receiving his orders, and give the customary alarm only when the foe was near enough for them to see for themselves. What, then, was his joyful surprise, to discover that the sentinels were from his old company, whose ensign he had so victoriously borne! In a few words he stated the case; the word was rapidly passed, and they fell back on the en- campment as stealthily as the approaching and confident foe was advancing. The captain of the thousand, who was none other than. Jerimoth, who had had command of the guard that was to lead Benaiah to execution, and who was so heartily glad when the pardon came, requested him now to lead his old , comrades into action, as their captain was absent. This he gladly consented to do. An advantageous position was speedily taken, and quietly they awaited the advance of the Philistines. Soon night's stillness was suddenly invaded, first by the loud battle-cries of the contending hosts, and then the clash of steel answered by steel! Though taken at a decided disadvantage, the Philistines fought valiantly,. as if striving to regain by skill and bravery the opportunity they had lost. "Adonai and Israel!" was the oft repeated cry of the Jews, answered by "Baal and Philistia!" for it .was thus that foe distinguished foe, and friend aided friend. Stars do not lend their light for scenes of carnage. The conflict was not of long duration. If a general attack had been contemplated, it was relinquished. The Philistines gradually fell back, fighting as they retreated. Orders at length came from Joab that the pursuit should be given up. The Israelites who had been engaged returned to their old position, bearing with them the dead and wounded to the camp of Israel.   THE WATCHERS.         313 The roll was called, but among the living none answered to the name of Benaiah. The pale faces of the dead, lit up by the flaring light of torches, were eagerly scanned, and then the search was continued over every foot of ground that had been trampled on by the feet of contending warriors. Ethni, joined by Adin and Helem, did not give up this labor of love till they were warned, by the near ap- \ proach of day, that they had other and sterner duties to accomplish. Reluctantly they turned away; for a moment, softened by grief at their loss, then fired by a fierce de- termination- to avenge it in the conflict of the coming day. CHAPTER II. THE WATCHER. INTELLIGENCE of the battle, which, after a prolonged and hotly contested fight, had at length resulted in a victory for the Israelites, reached Jerusalem the day after its occur- rence. Generally, it was an occasion of great rejoicing, but here and there were houses into which it brought sorrow and mourning. The victory had been dearly purchased, and those who had been heavily assessed to pay the fearful price, gazed so fixedly upon their lessened store that they had eyes for nought else. But the houses over which war had passed, leaving no dead, or within whose precincts were no sufferers, bringing the saddest of all mementoes of their valor from the battle- field, poured forth jubilant throngs to mingle in the general joy. It was a glorious occasion, for it proclaimed a'united and victorious Israel! Scarcely had this ebullition of exuberant joy subsided, and the city returned to its ordinary tranquillity, when down from the hill of Zion, and through the streets of Jerusalem towards the Prison Gate, swept a procession of more than ordinary solemnity and pomp. Though numerous, and com- posed of those highest in authority or rank, for the King had given special orders regarding it, and had even joined it himself, it had a great central feature, that attracted all "     314          ATHALIAH. attention--nay more, all reverence. This was the Ark of the Covenant, covered with its curtains of blue, from be- neath which gleamed the golden. staves by which it was borne. The great day of atonement was drawing near, and it therefore became necessary to carry this sacredest symbol of the Divine Presence down to Gibeon, and place it in its old place in the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle. How wonderful its history, comprising a period of over four hundred and three-score years! Its unveiled splendor, never gazed on with impunity since it left the hands of the divinely inspired artizan, Bezaleel, save by the High Priest, and then only with bent and trembling form, once in each year! Well-nigh forty years it traversed the wil- derness, making in all that time thirty journeyings! The feet of the Priests, bearing it into the brink of Jordon, stayed its swollen waters that they stood upon an heap! Passed it, in more than earthly triumph, a nation of three million souls! Following it, an army of six hundred thou- sand stalwart warriors beheld the walls of Jericho fall at their feet! Seven years it rests in its Tabernacle home in Gilgal, wait- ing the conquest of the land; hence on to Shiloh, where gener- ation after generation thought it had found a final abiding place. For over three hundred years, there it was sheltered. Then came a sorry day in Jewish history, when the Isra- elites, discomfited more by their own iniquities than through the prowess of their enemies, neglected the substance for the shadow, and trusted more in the symbol than the Great Being it symbolized. They cried out for the Ark of the Covenant, and the over-indulgent Eli yielded to the solicita- tions of his corrupt sons, who were to go with it, and it was carried into the camp of Israel. Its advent was hailed bv a shout of exultation that shook not simply the earth, but the hearts of their enemies, the Philistines, and gave them only the courage of despair. They, too, had heard of Jordan and Jericho! The battle of Eben-ezer is fought! An old man sitting by the roadside falls dead, slain by the simple words: ' the Ark of God is taken!"His daughter-in-law, the widow, and the mother of but a few hours, breathes from her dying lips: "( The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of the Lord is taken!"   THE WATCHER.          315 Desiring to pay this captured god all honor, the Philis- tines place it in the house of Dagon. In the silence and soli- tude of night the senseless image of the idol falls prostrate before the Ark of the Covenant, its head and hands, all of it that represented humanity, crushed and broken, the fish- part alone remaining. Ashdod, Gath, Ekron, Gaza, and Askelon, felt God's heavy hand resting upon them. Disease and death caused such a cry of distress to go up to heaven, that the five lords of the cities consulted, and wisely agreed to give up that which the Israelites had not the strength or desire to re-capture. Beautiful the simple narrative of this restoration! Placed on a new-made cart, with a coffer containing a golden offer- ing from each of the five lords of the Philistines, drawn by two milch kine on whose necks had never come yoke, their bleating offspring shut up away from them ; these two brute mothers lowing in sorrow, yet impelled by a mighty power to go gently forward, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left. Thus, after seven months' exile, the Ark of the Covenant returns to the thousands of Israel. The full effects of the fatal error in divorcing it from its divinely-appointed place, were not yet consummated. Fifty thousand Bethshemites, actuated by an unholy curiosity, remove the lid of the Ark and look upon its sole contents-the two tablets of stone en- graven by the finger of God on Mount Sinai, placed there by Moses three hundred and fifty years before. Death proves the penalty of their profanation. Its next place of sojourn is Kirjath-gearim. Here it re- mained five-score years and  ten. During this eventful period in the history of the commonwealth, the form of government was changed by the infatuation of the people from a theocracy to a monarchy. Lightly the first king of Israel regarded this most sacred of symbols. But when David was firmly established on the throne, one of his first cares was to bring up the Ark of the Coven- ant to the royal city. Why he did not convey it directly to its old tabernacle-home, now reared in Gibeon, and from which it had been separated over one hundred years; or why it was ever suffered again to be carried into battle while the woeful disaster of Eben-ezer still lived in the history of the nation, is hard to conjecture.     316         ATHALIAH. Easy to conceive why King David desired to make Mount Zion the place of its abode, but difficult to see how the man after God's own heart could so violate the holy order, ordained amid the quakings and thunderings of Sinai, that it should find a resting-place in the tabernacle, the pattern of which was shown Moses in the mount. The death of Uzzah had forcibly reminded the King that the "due order" of the Ark's conveyance was on the should- ers of the Kohathites, and not on a new-made cart, as the Philistines had done. Strange, indeed, that the weightier matter of its final resting-place was so passed over! Great was the pomp which accompanied the holy Ark to the city of David! Thirty thousand men went with it. "The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, in the midst are the damsels playing on the timbrels!" But amid all the rejoicing, heightened by the liberal hos- pitality of David to all the people, an incident occurred in strange discord with the general joy. The King, on return- ing to his house, is met by his wife Michal, daughter of the late King, and erst wife of the unhappy Phaltiel, who hurls at her lord the biting sarcasm: "How glorious was the King of Israel to-day!" and compares him, in plain lan- guage, with a vain fellow who shamelessly uncovereth him- self. The punishment David inflicted, by discarding her, seems a further unhappy result growing out of a deviation of the mode of guardianship of the Holy Ark ordained by God; for who can say that Michal, who had once inspired the youthful warrior to such deeds of valor, would not have protected him from the wiles of Bathsheba, and guarded his life from the deepest stain that ever disfigured it. As the procession slowly and solemnly winds its way through the streets of the city, it passes a dwelling at whose window stands a pale, tearful, trembling woman, who, as the Ark of the Covenant passes, falls upon her knees, with eyes downcast. This woman is Rebekah. In an adjoining chamber lies Ethni, lost to consciousness, in the fitful, feverish sleep of one trembling on the confines of the grave. In the late battle he had been dangerously wounded; had insisted with the little strength left him on being conveyed to Jeru- salem. Adin and Helem, unscathed in the terrible conflict,   THE WATCHER.    .     317 had superintended the removal with all the tenderness and care possible. On his arrival, Ethni had just life enough left in him to make complete the reconciliation with his mother, which, on his departure, had only been partially af- fected. Then came stupor, alternating with delirium, and Rebekah in the anguish of her heart felt that her only son had come home but to die. How acute her feelings, then, as she knelt with reverent awe as the shrouded Ark of the Covenant passed by! - She felt herself in the presence of God, who held all hbrlife's happiness, its aims, its purposes, in his grasp. He could withhold, he could restore! From her heart rang out the despairing cry of the mother: "Oh! save mly son!" Fromn her crushed and broken spirit flowed petition for the swift relief of pardon for the sin of her youth, and the pride and obduracy of her later years! A murmuring sound issues from the inner chamber, and Rebekah, with tears on her cheek, and a dawning light of peace in her contrite heart, hurries to the bed-side of her son. He had not awakened, but troublous dreams were busy in his brain. He turned uneasily, muttering: "Benaiah! Benaiah! beware of Athaliah!" Rebekah laid her hand gently on his feverish brow. A peaceful expression, which was almost a smile, settled on his features, and he lay still again. The mother sank down on a pile of cushions near the bed- side, and, as she watched the slumbers of the invalid, she mused on the words she had just heard uttered, "Athaliah!" The name which above all others represented the one great sin of her life! She could not now make restitution, it is true, but ought she not go and confess her sin to the wronged one and ask her forgiveness, as she had already sought it of her God? Thus gently urged her awakened conscience. But from answering questions so plain and to the point, she allowed herself to be lured away by a consideration of what the words could mean in the connection in which they were uttered. She recalled to mind that Athaliah had urged her, after Benaiah's trial and conviction for treason, to join with her in efforts for his pardon from the King. Ethni's dream-words were then unmeaning, for why should Benaiah need warning against the woman who had endeav- ored to save him.     O13         ATi HALIAI L Then in the weakness of her heart, avoiding the thought of Athaliah, and the closely-allied question her conscience had put to her, she let her thoughts slip away and wander elsewhere.           6 Helem had told her, among the other details concerning Ethni which her mother heart longed to know in all their entirety, of the search they had instituted for the body of Benaiah on the eve of the battle, and of the grief he shared in common with them at their bitter loss. What, then, of this Benaiah, who seemed to have been so dear to him, who was all the world to her! Her knowledge concerning him flits rapidly through her mind. An ensign-bearer, whose skill and bravery on a sin- gle occasion had been so prominent as to win him fame; next, in aspect less favorable to her mother heart, he ap- pears as the successful rival in love of her son, and the means mayhap of causing him to embrace the military pro- fession. Another count in the indictment against him, she had formerly recorded, but now happily stricken out, yea, though that son lay at the point of death through having made such a choice! Then he looms up as the accused of treason, the tried, the convicted! And now she sees that what she then deemed a zeal for King and country, in re- fusing to join with Athaliah in efforts for his rescue, was but a pitiful pretence-that the real motive was a feeling of re- venge on her son's part. Then appears that scene, when she finds Zillah with Ethni, with its stormy ending, and she recollects that in subse- quent reflection she could not avoid linking it with some de- sign of her son to repair what the King's pardon of Ben- aiah had overthrown. Next she hears that Miriam is beyond Benaiah's reach, and she looks for exultation in Ethni, but lo! for a sadness verging on the indifference of despair. He asks her forgive- ness, but with the gentle negligence of one who is above the passions to which earth ministers. With wonderment she sees him suddenly aroused to animation by the summons to battle. He leaves her with nothing explained as to the cause that led to the rupture between them. He returns, belonging to the dead more than the living, and the mystery still further deepened by this sudden affection for Benaiah. Thus Rebekah muses as she watches the slumber of her   I      RIPENING PURPOSES.       319 wounded son. Sad and full of sorrow as she is, there is a certain concord in her heart that, though it may not be peace, has something of its harmony. Suddenly, without apparent cause,.an inward shudder, like a cold breath, sweeps over her heart-strings, and there ensues a jar of discord; the foreboding of a great and rapidly approaching evil for a moment ruffles the soothing sensation in her soul, of peace with God. The procession without has not yet entirely passed her house, and it has joined it with one at whose window stands a woman gazing at the solemn pageant, but not tearfully and reverently bowed as was Rebekah. Was it the influence of that cold eye, if not scornful, at least in- different even to contempt--or rather of the malignant soul that enlivened it-that: passed along the line of communi- cation, and fell with its chill and blasting breath on the poor mourner's crushed and bleeding hopes? CHAPTER III. RIPENING PURPOSES. THAT woman was Athaliah. The sound of the trumpets blown by the priests had attracted her to the window. She glances carelessly along the line, exchanges a smile of re- cognition with a tall warrior occupying the post of honor amid the military escort, and then, without even waiting for the Holy Ark to pass, turns from the casement. "I tell thee, Rizpah!" she angrily exclaimed, as if resum- ing a theme that had only been momentarily interrupted, "everything goes wrong! Satan, disgusted with our su- pineness, is taking his work out of our hands!" A bitter laugh concluded the sentence, and Athaliah sank upon a pile of cushions, and the next instant was biting in rage the silken cord of her girdle. Rizpah calmly regarded her without speaking. "Well, Rizpah! why dost thou not answer me! Hast found all thy plans and plottings useless, and art thou about giving up in despair?" "By no means, Athaliah," replied the unmoved Rizpah.     320         ATHALIAH. 'Never have matters shaped themselves better for the terrible and speedy success of our long years' labor than at present." "Fool that thou art, to talk thus!" retorted the exas- perated Athaliah. "This Ethni, that was to be the cause of such acute anguish to Rebekah by despising her as a trickster, lies at the point of death. His loss, incurred by Rebekah for her king and country, will win sympathy and mayhap leniency for her, when the final announcement of her guilt is made. Benaiah, too, another great weapon, has slipped away from us-" "Ethni will not die, and Benaiah will return," replied Rizpah. "Spoken like an oracle!" sneeringly retorted Athaliah; "but, unfortunately, I am not a dupe to place any confidence in it. If thou hadst said, Ethni will die, Benaiah will not return, I would have given thee credit for fulfilling thy words." There was a momentary flush of Rizpah's cheek, a kind- ling in her dark eye, but she calmly replied: "I speak not boastfully. Just as Ethni's litter entered Jerusalem, he fainted from exhaustion. Near the gate there resides a noted healer of wounds, one of my nation. He was immediately summoned, for the symptoms were alarm- ing. He told me afterwards that Rebekah had retained his services, and that he felt confident he could effect a cure. As for Benaiah, he was probably only taken a pris- oner, as diligent search was made for him without success." "Well, daughter of Satan! what next? After calling back these brothers to life, what use canst thou put them to?" Rizpah stooped, as if to adjust her sandal, but in reality to conceal her features. "Was Athaliah growing more un- bearable, or she less patient?" she asked herself; and she answered in the same mute language, "my time will soon come now;" and when she raised her head, her face was calm again. "Tell me first, Athaliah, am I not laboring for thy revenge equally with my own?" "That may be;" replied Athaliah, somewhat toned down by Rizpah's immobility; " but what I am so angered at is, in allowing myself to be turned aside by thy so oft iterated injunction, 'wait till a better time comes.'"   RIPENING PURPOSES.       21 "Well, then, Athaliah, I tell thee my advice was wise, and the time has come which will prove it to have been so. The denunciation of Rebeka shall be openly made. She will be utterly disgraced for abusing a law of Moses, by making it the means of fraud, and for playing the hypocrite for a score of years. "That would have resulted years ago," interrupted Atha- liah. "Yes, but mark the difference! Rebekah will not be pun- ished with death. She will live, and live for what? Listen: Benaiah, freed from marrying Sarah, who is not his sister-in- law, will wed Miriam. Should ought happen to Benaiah," and Rizpah uttered these words with satanic significance, Ethni will have the right of the brother-in-law to take Miriam for his wife." "Thou wilt not succeed with Ethni, subtle as thou think- est thyself!" "I shall not make the effort. Benaiah will die suddenly and violently, and under circumstances that shall so fasten the guilt on Ethni, that even his mother will not doubt it. Yes!" added Rizpah, in a lightness of tone more terrible than any vehemence of language, " we will re-produce your sacred history. We will have our Eve first turned out of Eden, and then produce a Cain and Abel, which shall only differ outwardly from the original as far as this: the ages of the brothers will be reversed, which is but trifling; but our Cain, instead of having a mark set upon him that none At  might kill him, shall be so branded that all will be eager to fling a stone at him and curse his memory!" Athaliah did not reply at once. A suggestion had sprung up in her mind, from whither she knew not, that it might be well to content herself with Rebekah's disgrace, and then get rid of this woman, who seemed to regard murder as mere pastime. It was not fear that prompted the thought, nor caution, nor caprice. The volition appeared to her to come from without herself. The steady tramp and murmuring sound from the street was about ceasing. The vanguard of the long procession having the Ark of the Covenant in its reverent keeping had at length reached the city gate through which it was to find egress. A priest, dusty and travel-stained, mounted on a jaded horse, awaits the passage of the multitude that he "*     322          ATHALIAH. imay enter the city. While he thus waits, it will be neces. sary to recount the incident that has induced him to make a lengthy and hurried journey, and then pass on to witness the scene in which he is about to present himself. CHAPTER IV, THE CONFESSIOXN IT is Haniel, the priest to whom Benaiah applied for suc- cor in his trouble, who thus waits at the city gate, con- nected by that living, undulating chain with the house in which Athaliah holds dark council with the heathen Rizpah. Not to that house, though, does he intend to hasten, but to one about mid-way, which the procession is now passing, and before whose door the Holy Ark has just arrived. Haniel, immediately after the Feast of Tabernacles, left Gibeon and went to his accustomed home, the family of his daughter, in the portion of Naphtali. Though freed a large portion of the year from actual service at the Tabernacle, the good and faithful priest always found work to do for his Divine Master. No nation so highly favored but has its sick and afflicted, its ignorant and its poor. These are God's fields, and if his ministers are faithful, they must la- bor therein.             ^ So felt, and so acted Haniel. Into many a lowly dwell- ing in the mountainous district of Naphtali, he entered as friend, as teacher, as consoler. Other priests there were, who, ambitious of kingly favor and regard, took every op- portunity of commending themselves to the notice of David. Haniel was content to receive the blessings of the poor and needy, who had nothing else to give, and happy in the smile of God, which fell like mellowing sunlight on his peacefully declining years. One afternoon he was sent for by a woman who lay at the point of death, who urgently desired to see him. He im- mediately set out, the messenger serving as his guide. From hin he learnt that the woman's name was Milcah, that she   THE CONFESSION.         323 lived alone, with only a little maid-servant to attend on her. She had been sick for a week or more, but not dan- gerously so, and had received assistance from the messen- ger's wife. During the day she had sunk rapidly, and im- plored her kind neighbors, again and again, to lose no time in sending for Haniel. When the priest entered the chamber of the dying Milcah she lay with closed eyes, as if sleeping; but upon hearing footsteps she raised her eyelids, already heavy with the lan- guor of death, and motioned those with her to leave her alone with Haniel, as if she wished to husband the few words she had strength to utrr for more important ends. The priest commenced in low gentle tones to repeat the opening versesof the Twentieth Psalm, when to his surprise Milcah interrupted him by a gesture of dissent, and, ral- lying all her remaining energy, told him the secret history of the tragical event which, though occurring a score of years ago, still lived in the memories of all those who had heard of the sudden desolation of Naaman's house. She told it as the dying speak of matters that must be told before the soul will leave its tabernacle-with flicker- inlg strength that seems each moment sinking into darkness; with sentences disconnected-a word here and    there- an agonizing straining of the dimmed sight to detect if the poor incoherent utterings have found a lodgement in the mind of him who may be able to convert them  into acts of usefulness--the trembling avidity with which the stimu- lant is swallowed, as if the few moments of artificial being it gives were worth a spring-time; and  then, when Death will be put off no longer, but striking one fell blow, shatters the house of life-the fallen jaw, the staring eye, the stiff- ened limbs, seem still as if they were endeavoring to fulfil the intense desire of the departed soul! Thus died Milcah, struggling till the last. Haniel called in the woman who had been with her when he came, and point- ing to the bed on which lay the dead, he told her she was gone. Seeking solitude, he carefully collected and arranged in his memory each circumstance that had just been told him, for he saw at once how full of consequence- they were to the welfare of those he loved. Thus shaped, what he had heard was as follows:     324:         ATHALIAH. Twenty years before, an Arab woman, a soothsayer of no mean reputation, named Rizpah, had brought to Milcah, in the mountains of Naphtali, a male infant of but a few hours old, and had forced her to exchange it for a female infant, the daughter of Naomi, wife of Ahaziah. The male infant was reared as his son, and received the name of Benaiah. Milcah kept the little girl for Rizpah for three years, and then took it to Gibeah and delivered it to her. Its name was Zillah. Of the parentage of Benaiah, Milcah was entirely ignorant. Rizpah, while sojourning in the portion of Naph. tali, had renewed the acquaintance of Hezron, Naaman's soln, which she had first secretly formed in Egypt, and it was his infatuation for her that had brought such ruin on Naa- man's house. Milcah in all this had been a most unwilling ally of Rizpah, urged to it by fear of the Arab woman's enmity. Before returning to his home he entered the dwelling that had been Milcah's, to take a last look of the dead. ; He started at the change produced by the few kind offices of the women, who had straitened her for the grave. Not a hint in the placid expression of those pallid features of the fearful struggle he had lately witnessed. There was no ri- gidity about the mouth, but the lips were slightly parted, as if breath was still stealing in and out. The eyelids looked as if at the sound of a voice they might again be raised. But the living now claimed the offices of the good old man, and with a silent prayer that this daughter of Abraham might be gathered into the fold of the Great Shepherd, he turned from the habitation of the dead to hasten to carry joy to the hearts of those who were yet treading the paths of young and earnest life. CHAPTER V. THE INHERITANCE. ZILLAH'S position in the household of Adin had materially changed, soon after that memorable night, when so many events had crowded together to change the current of the   THE INHERITANCE.        325 maiden's life. Her meeting with Reuben in the porch of Adin's house, so quickly followed by his daring and heroic effort in which her life was rescued from the trampling of horses' feet; her ambush in the house of Athaliah, thrust as it were upon her, when her heart taught her how deeply she loved Ethni, by urging her on to such energetic efforts to save' him from a crime which could only result in a shame worse than the death he intended inflicting; her interview with Ethni and its successful issue, the peace springing from which neither Rebekah's scorn and unjust suspicion, nor the sure knowledge that the man she had saved could ever be hers, could eradicate; her meeting with her mother the next morning, when she had dared for the first time, quietly but firmly, to resist that feared mother's authority in the cause of love and truth; and finally, the climax of her interview with Athaliah, in which she had been led little by little to take so defiant a part. All these-circumstances had aroused in her a courage and energy which could never sleep again. Lowly her station in life might be, but it had its duties, and she determined henceforth to fulfil them without fear. The spell that had hung like an incubus on her life, she had by one vigorous impulse shaken off. No more blind obedi- ence to Rizpah's commands, no dread forebodings to what such mistaken obedience might lead. Yet, though feeling strong in the rectitude of her motives, she felt the necessity of improving whatever means of support and comfort God had placed in her way. She remembered how often her gentle and beautiful mistress had invited her confidence, and had so indulgently overlooked each repulse she had received in return. Now she felt herself worthy of Miriam's regard, and she determined to embrace the first opportunity of making her acquainted with the trials that had beset her past, the hopes and purposes that spanned the clouded future. Such opportunity was not long in coming. A great shadow had settled on Miriam's life, and her eyes had gained a power of vision they did not possess in the days of her sunny brightness. She saw objects hidden before in the shade, that lay beyond her sun-lit path; saw the wistful expression on Zillah's face and in her eyes, as if the soul were striving to find voice and cry, " aid me in the untried path I am treading."     326          ATHALIAT. Seeking a favorable time, the mistress sent for the maid, and fearing to defeat the good results of the efforts she hoped to accomplish, by a formal interview, she gave Zillah some trifling work to do in the room to which she had summoned her. A few kind, persuasive words from Miriam, and Zillah was at her feet, asking in broken tones her forgiveness for having so long declined the rich boon of her sympathy and support. A round, white arm gleams above the dark tresses of Zillah's hair, glides along her suppliant form, and circling her waist, raises her to Miriam's bosom. Miriam, in the limpid pureness of her soul, saw something more in the serving-maid than the mere servant. It claimed her as a sister, and though the delicately nurtured Jew- ish maiden was ignorant of the fact that Zillah's lineage was but little less noble than her own, she had long since discerned in her traits of character that drew her towards her attendant, without her knowing the cause. Zillah remained for a moment clasped to Miriam's breast; then, gently disengaging herself, she sank upon a cushion placed at her mistress' feet. At first Zillah intended disclosing only what related par- ticularly to herself, but as she proceeded, and felt at each step how entirely she met with sympathy and interest, bar- rier after barrier fell away, and at length Miriam knew all that was in her heart. Even her love for Ethni had been so scantily covered over, that it had gleamed out here and there, and Miriam was pained when she reflected how hopeless such love must be, but, after all, not more hopeless than her own! Of her early life Zillah could tell but little, and that lit- tle was more like the fragments of dreams than a connected narrative. She could not recall an act of fondness or love on her mother's part, but yet there had been a uniform care exercised over her, which had proved kindly judicious. In all their wandering life she had never suffered lack of food or clothing, and had been shielded by no weak hand from insult and injury. No obstacle had ever been thrown in her way when she was seeking admission as a proselyte to the Jewish faith. But in return for all this, her mother had de- manded a prompt and unquestioning obedience, and herein   THE INHERITANCE.        327 lay all the trials of her life. The voice of nature and the revealed will of God told her she must honor and obey her mother, and yet she often had too good reason to fear that such obedience might result in injury to others. But light had stolen in upon her perplexity, as if Heaven- sent, and she had learned how to draw the line of duty towards her earthly parent so that it might not cross and conflict with the one she owed her Heavenly Father. Zillah had been with Miriam at the time when Helem, among the first to reach Jerusalem after the battle, had announced to his sister with cautious preparation that  Benaiah llad been missing since the eve of the engagement, and had added, with comparative indifference, that Ethni had been dangerously if not mortally wounded. He little recked the sharp pang he had inflicted on Zillah. But, restraining her own emotions, Zillah sought the eye of Miriam to convey to her mutely her sympathy in this new sorrow. Their glances met, each charged with the same holy mission. The thought, the impulse, in each heart, had been identical. I   The solemn trumpet blasts announce the approach of the procession bearing the Ark of the Covenant in its midst, and Miriam, with the members of her household-for all have common interest and rights in the passing pageant- await at the windows its coming. As various, mayhap, the emotions it produces upon the gazers as are their ages, temperaments, and conditions, yet the feelings of two, who outwardly show the greatest contrast, flow in perfect unison : Miriam and Zillah-the mistress and the maid-the high-born Jewish maiden and a proselyte of the gate! The sight of that shrouded Ark touches the same chord in their hearts, nevertheless, for each is striving to drown in the depth and greatness of the Being it symbolizes her own little griefs and sorrows. On sweeps the multitude with its steady tramp, fainter and fainter grow the trumpet sounds, and now but a mur- muring is left, like the dull surging of waves far away. The windows are deserted, and the avocations of the household, suspended for the time, beat again in healthful play. Miriam is in her favorite apartment, her only attendant Zillah, who is reading to her mistress some of King David's     328          ATHALIAfI. Psalms--Psalms of which the royal author caught the in- spiration from the fires of an adversity that few men have experienced, not less than from illumination of the Divine Light: the Psalmist of Israel had learned in a bitter school how to speak to the suffering, having himself been the keen- est of sufferers. The skilful fingers of Miriam are busy weaving hues of silken beauty on tapestry for the adornment of God's ser- vice. This retired apartment then, though lacking the ju- bilant vibrations of joy, is redolent with the breathings of high resolves and holy hopes, while sacred industry lures away the mind from dwelling too intently upon its sorrows. But a wave from the outer world breaks upon this peace- ful strand. A traveller, bearing upon him the traces of a long journey, has alighted at the outer gate, and demands to see Miriam. His wishes are complied with, and he is conducted by Miriam's order to -her presence. Zillah remains with her mistress. The good old priest, experienced in all the sorrows and ills the heart is heir to, feels at once that he is in an atmos- phere of affliction, but his eye lightens when he thinks that God has placed in his feeble hands the power to open wide the casement, and let in sunshine to flood this darkened room. Though scarcely acquainted with Miriam, he has sought her first, not knowing where to find Benaiah. Alas! poor Haniel-unavailing comforter! who does know where to find him! And yet thou glancest at Zillah before making thy an- nouncement, so full of joy and comfort as thou deemest it to Miriam, as if mutely questioning whether the serving maid is to be a partaker of the intelligence thou bearest, lit tie imagining that thy message of happiness is to her alone! A few words of explanation by Haniel to Miriam, and then he hastens to announce that all obstacles to her union with Benaiah are removed-that Sarah has no claim upon him, for he was not Reuben's brother. Haniel asked himself if the despairing look upon Miriam's face was from an unbelief of what he said. Zillah, at a ges ture from Miriam, came to her relief, and told the priest in low and broken tones that Benaiah had disappeared in a night skirmish with the Philistines.   THE INHERITANCE.        329 The bitterly disappointed Haniel could offer but little hope. Even if a captive in the hands of the cruel enemy, exasperated by their late defeat, how long could he count on life! A silence of a few minutes' duration intervened. Miriam, somewhat recovered, asked how such a strange discovery had been made known to him. Haniel replied, by minutely recounting the scene that had occurred in the chamber of the dying Milcah. He had seated himself near Miriam, at whose feet lay the tapestry she had been embroidering. At a little distance stood Zillah, still absently holding in her hands the open roll of parchment from which she had been reading. In the recital, so simply told, so eagerly listened to, Han- iel had omitted to mention the name of Rizpah, speaking of her as a woman of a strange nation; but towards the conclusion of his story, when his hearers were in possession of all its salient points, the name of Rizpah fell from his lips. Instantly he is interrupted by a partially suppressed ex- clamation! The roll of parchment falls from Zillah's grasp! He feels a hand laid on his arm, and, turning, sees a face paled with intensity of feeling-hears a thrilling voice, ask- ing him the name of the infant Rizpah stole. "Its lame was Zillah," was the calm reply. Who can fully know the emotions of that heart save God, who gave it strength to bear such mighty influx of joy without bursting! For a moment she stood transfixed, her lips gently parted, her arm partially upraised, as if await- ing for the giant proportions of this great boon to develop themselves. Then she sank upon her knees, and clasping together her uplifted hands, murmured: "Oh! my God! the God of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I thank thee!" Miriam knelt beside her, and soon they were clasped in a warm embrace. Haniel was not long in learning what freightage of joy he had borne from the mountains of Naphtali. The treasure he thought he was conveying had vanished; but what a blessing, concealed from all save God, he had brought to that house! That Zillah was no longer a servant or dependent; that in an instant she had passed from poverty and lowliness, to     OuV          A'l'HAHl . wealth and rank; great though this 'was, it was little, it was nothing, in comparison with the fact that she was of the lineage of God's chosen people, a daughter of Israel, an heir of the promises, a rightful sharer in the glorious memories of the past! This was the hour of sublime and holy exaltation for the soul! But soon the heart asked, "what is my portion?" Reuben, her brother, was dead, and all that was left to her was the recollection of his kind words and counsel, and of his heroic efforts for her preservation. And how well did her memory execute its office in bringing from the past each lineament of that face, each tone of that voice, alas  now hushed for ever in the grave! "But who were Benaiah's parents?" became the trem- bling enquiry now. Was Zillah's exaltation to be at the expense of depriving him of the noble lineage he had borne? If so, each felt that it were better he never returned, either from captivity or the grave. One only could clear up this mystery, and that one was Rizpah, and Zillah offered to seek her immediately, and ascertain if possible the truth. CHAPTER    VI. THE LOST AND FOUND. ZILLAH was right in supposing that she would find Rizpah at the house of Athaliah, whither she wended her steps. She had not seen her since the morning when she had dared to assert her privilege of doing right. Though Zillah felt she might accuse Rizpah of the great- est perfidy in robbing her of the home and parentage God had bestowed upon her, she resolved to spare the woman, who was happily nothing to her now, all invective, and strive only to win from her the secret of Benaiah's birth. Hardened as Rizpah was, she quailed before Zillah when the intelligence burst upon her that Milcah had confessed all, and that the truth was known. But she soon recovered her boldness, and, impudently laughing, enquired of Zillah what had procured her the honor of a visit.   THE LOST AND FOUND.        331 "I wish, Rizpah, to learn the names of Benaiah's pa- rents." "But Benaiah has vanished," was the sneering reply; "what matter, then, what family claims him?" "There is a hope he may some day return, and, even if that hope is never realized, some good may grow out of the truth, some injustice may be repaired.') ".And what if I refuse to tell?" "I thought, Rizpah, that in partial reparation of the wrong thou hast done me, thou wouldst grant my request." "Thou art mistaken, then, daughter of Ahaziah, as thou art proud now to call thyself. I have no intention of giv- ing the information." Zillah, foreseeing no prospects of changing this woman's purpose, and disgusted by her effrontery, was glad to leave the house. She did not pursue the most direct way in returning to Miriam. The deviation she made would take her past Re- bekah's house. There were associations connected with it, which it was pleasant to revive. It was while living there she had embraced as a proselyte the Jewish faith. There had occurred that interview where she had been enabled to turn Ethni from the commission of a great crime. Now he lay dangerously wounded within its walls. She would pass near him, breathing a prayer for his recovery as she walked by. Ah! happy thought! They were now children of the same heritage, and though she acknowledged no hope to herself that he would ever return the affection she felt for him, yet there was consolation in the feeling that she was his equal. Thus, with thoughts in which mingled the earthly and the heavenly, yet not in discord, Zillah approached the house of Rebekah. She casts a hurried glance at the windows, as if longing and yet fearing to see a familiar face, when her glance is transformed into a steady but bewildered gaze. Is it an apparition from the grave that confronts her! or are her eyes cheating her with some, phantom of the imagina- tion? No; it is really Benaiah looking listlessly into the street. Obeying her first impulse, she hastens to Rebekah's door. The quiet formalism of the servant who answers her sum- mons first recalls her to herself. She realizes the difficulties     332          ATHALIAH.  of her position. Rebekah only knows her as a former ser. vant, and one against whom she entertains what to the mother seems a well grounded prejudice. Will she be re- ceived? If she only possessed the secret of Benaiah's parentage she would have felt surer of emerging with success from' the scene into which she had precipitated herself. Could Zillah have known of the penitence and humility that had overcome the proud heart of Rebekah, she would not have feared the results of the interview. Little did she think that it was the woman she deemed so proud and im- movable who was the one who only had cause for fear. It was while Rebekah was watching by the bedside of her son, after the Ark of the Covenant had passed by, that Benaiah presented himself, seeking tidings of his wounded  friend. He had been taken prisoner the night of the skir- : mish, the impetuosity of his attack having led him beyond the  support of his companions. He owed his subsequent escape! to some singular circumstances, which will be related hereafter i 'As he entered the room, Ethni had awakened, and with a [ smile of pleasure weakly beckoned him to approach. With gentle step he hastened to the bed-side, and kneeling down, pressed a kiss on his brother's pale brow. Their mother, with eyes brimful of tears, stood looking down upon them. This, the first meeting of these three together!  Ethni, exhausted by his emotion, sinks into an uncon- sciousness that has more of death than sleep about it.  Then comes the request from Zillah, that she might have, speech with Rebekah. She cannot leave her son, and, not wishing to send the applicant away unsatisfied, she says she  will see her there. How thick the veil that hangs before the future, when the soul with all its wonderful powers can approach the great crises of life unmoved, unwarned, as this! Zillah enters, and Rebekah receives her with a gentle  kindness that dispels all her fear of being misunderstood or  repulsed. The apartment is spacious, and they are removed the greatest distance from the alcove in which stands the bed on which Ethni is lying. His pale, thin face is painfully visible, and a shuddering seizes Zillah as she glances towards   THE LOST AND FOUND.        333      1 it. Her heart tells her the interview must be brief and quiet as possible. Intimating more by gesture than speech that Benaiah was also to hear what she had to say, Zillah, in a few softly- uttered words, told her hearers that Haniel, an aged priest, had lately received the dying confession of a mid-wife named Milcah, who, twenty years before, in the portion of Naphtali, while in attendance upon the wife of Ahaziah, had replaced the infant daughter born to her, by a rmale infant brought by a woman, who had instigated her to commit the crime, and who had afterwards reared the girl as her own; that she, Zillah, was the child thus stolen away, and that Benaiah was the one who had taken her rightful place in Ahaziah's household. She added that she had just left the chief actor in the iniquitous transaction, who had refused to tell who Benaiah's parents were. This woman's name was Rizpah. A groan of agony startles the stillness of the sick-room, and Zillah and Benaiah see Rebekah turn quickly her face towards the couch of her son; but she does not move, and the room is hushed again. Oh! could they see Rebekah's face, what a fearful revelation it would make! It was but the instinct of self-preservation that had caused her to turn where no eye could see her, for surely there is no volition of will, no power of concealment in those fixed staring eyes, that seem to be fixed on the concentrated events of a score of years--nothing of the life that beams beneath the sun in the ashy pallor of that lip, that cheek, that brow! Oh! never to know her first-born till he stood up in the strength of manhood, to curse, nay worse, to despise her for her cruel abandonment of him, to satisfy the cravings of her lust! Oh! wretched mother! Has thy sin at length found thee out? Turning from the one son, thou hast shown thyself to the other. Thy groan, though stifled, aroused the sleep- ing Ethni! Whilst thou wert gazing into a fearful past, mingled with a more terrible future, he, horror stricken, has been looking on thee! He raises himself in bed and stretches his hands towards thee! Dost thou not see him? Rebekah remains immovable as a statue! But there is one avenue to her soul still open, and she hears the cry of Mother! Mother!"  This recalls her to the present, and in  334          ATHALIAS.  an instant she is by Ethni's side, supporting his head upon her bosom. "Ethni! my darling!" murmured the stricken mother, but no voice replied to this endearment. Her eyes lovingly sought his, but in them lay no answering expression; her heart throbbed strongly as she clasped him in a close em. brace; his had ceased its beatings for ever! The flickering flames of life that might have been pre- served by tender care, had gone suddenly out, and the  : mother, who alone of all others could have exercised that  tenderness, had been made the swift instrument of her son's destruction. A wail of anguish thrilled through the hushed room when :: Rebekah discovered that her son was dead. Benaiah had just time to reach her when she fell fainting into his arms. Zillah drew near, and, after casting a hasty glance on the inanimate Rebekah, she fixed a despairing gaze on the life- less form of Ethni. Her heart, rather than her eyes, told her that all was over, and, sinking on her knees, she buried her face in the drapery of the loved one's dying couch.  CHAPTER VIL. THE ACCUSATION.  How sudden are the transitions of life! Zillah, with a great grief in her heart, leaves the chamber of the dead to carry life's greatest joy to Miriam, by announcing to her that Benaiah had returned unharmed.  "Tell her," he said, as they parted at Rebekah's threshold,  "that I have gone to learn ift' my parenta-o S: , such that I  can offer her my hand without a blush. 'ixer heart will teach her that I will not tarry on an errand like this. God grant that my dreadful forebodings may not be realized." But a few minutes had elapsed since that sudden death- scene in which they had borne a part. The females of Re- bekah's household had been summoned, and to their care had been consigned their still insensible mistress. Zillah felt it was no place for her, and lingeringly she turned her   THE ACCUSATION.        335       eyes from the placid features of the dead, while Benaiah was all anxiety to know, and to know at once, whether his life was to be a golden holiday, or a mere existence, with- out an object, and without a hope. While he thought himself a son of Israel, he had been urged on by his passion for Miriam to attempt the viola- tion of one of the laws of his religion. Now, when the loved object was within his grasp, and no law of human or divine origin forbade its possession, he withdrew his hand and sternly determined to live and die without it, unless he could show his birth to be as pure and honorable as he sup- posed it to have been when he first wooed and won Miriam. Miriam had shown her strength of purpose. Benaiah was now to manifest his. Hers lad. sprung from faith; his was the emanation of pride. To her, peace had come as the life- long visitant; he saw in the dim future only the lowering fea- tures of despair! With dread forebodings in his heart he hastened towards the house of Athaliah, whither Zillah had directed him. As he drew near, his steps slackened their pace. Anxious as he was to know the worst, he feared the approach of the moment that was to decide his fate. What if this Rizpah he was about to see should prove to be his mother? Ter- rible as the idea was, it was probable! For a moment he hesitated, and had thoughts of seeing Haniel, and learning all the particulars of the abduction. But his reason told him such temporizing was but the weakness of the child and he went on, determined to face the coming evil with the courage of the man. Tohis demand for an interview with Rizpah, the servant, Caleb, replied that there was no woman of that name in the household of his mistress. Benaiah suggested that she might be a casual visitor to Athaliah, as he had certain knowledge that she had been in the house a little while pre- vious, and that as his business was of urgent importance he would beg him to make immediate enquiry. In giving his name Benaiah could not suppress a deep sigh, which caused a choking sensation in his throat, when the thought arose that he had for ever lost the old distinc- tive appellation of " son of Ahaziah," and was obliged to substitute for it " an officer in the King's service." During the absence of Caleb, Benaiah;busied himself   336          ATHALIAH. with conjecturing what relations Athaliah could sustain to- e wards Rizpah; the one a daughter of Israel, of rank and station, the other an adventurer of more than doubtful rep- utation. He recalled the first knowledge he had ever had of the former. It was from the lips of Miriam, while he was awaiting death in a prison cell. It was Athaliah who had gained admittance for her, and thus had made endurable that dread hour. Few and precious as its moments were, Miriam had found time to tell of Athaliah's gentle kindness, and her efforts in their behalf. It was then with a feeling of relief that he learned from Caleb on his return that his mistress desired to see him. If his doom were to be pronounced, it was some palliation to have the sentence uttered in the tones of a friendly voice.                           On his entering the room in which Athaliah waited to receive him, she did not rise from her seat, but motioned him with. an easy grace to a pile of cushions placed near her.                          *  "Thou wouldst see Rizpah; she is absent, but perhaps I may be of assistance to thee." Benaiah started! That voice, once heard, could not easily be forgotten. He instantly recognized it, as the one i that had so sweetly interceded for him in the tent of Joab.  "May I know thy thought?" enquired Athaliah, with a I smile that seemed all gentle kindness, as she noted Benaiah's ; surprise.                         I "Less than a year ago," replied the young officer, " an X ensign-bearer asked a great favor of Joab, which he refused, : but afterwards granted through the solicitations of one   whom I now thank for her kindness." Athaliah was too much mistress of herself to allow the little confusion she felt at this avowal to show itself. With  a gentle inclination of her head she resumed the conversa- tion:                           I "That was but a slight favor; what can I do for thee now?"                           "Within the last hour," replied Benaiah, in agitated tones, more alive than ever to the painful nature of his position, "I have learned that the name I have borne does not rightly belong to me, and at this moment I do not know whether I am a true-born son of Israel, or a miserable offspring of   IS? THE ACCUSATI0N.        337 shame or degradation. Tell me, then, I conjure thee, if thou knowest," continued Benaiah, his face paled with the inten- sity of his emotions, " what is yet in store for me, happiness or despair?"  "Calm thyself a moment," replied Athaliah, in accents of tenderest pity, " and tell me of whom thou heardst this strange and sad intelligence? '" "Of Zillah, who now inherits the name I have for ever lost!" "Where?" "At the house of thy cousin, Rebekah, whose son, Ethni, alas! now sleeps with his fathers!" t"Ethni dead!" exclaimed Athaliah, with an emotion that was not simulated. "He breathed his last in his mother's arms scarce half an hour since." There was a silence of a few moments, interrupted at last by Athaliah, who enquired: "Thou wast, then,'taken prisoner in the late battle, and hast made thy escape?" "Nay, rather was restored to liberty by the King of Gath, through the intercession of a venerable man whom I had never before seen, and even of whose name I am ignorant. But tell me, if thou canst, what Rizpah refused to make known to Zillah, what is my parentage?" "Benaiah!" replied Athaliah, with a lingering emphasis on the name that was full of affection, while a joyous light played in the soft depths of her lustrous eyes, "I rejoice to tell thee that thou wilt henceforth bear a name nobler than the one thou hast lost!" - She extended her hand, which gleamed forth from the crimson drapery of her falling sleeve, whiter and purer by contrast, towards Benaiah. Clasping it in his strong grasp, he fell on his knees at her feet, exclaiming in the very fer- vency of his heart: - "God bless thee for these words!" "Yes, Benaiah," pursued Athaliah, but there was a fast- increasing vehemence in her tones, though they lost none of their clearness, "thou wast born in consecrated wedlock, and thy parents ranked among the noblest, and yet I tell thee thy mother was a trickster and a thief, and some there be who think her also a murderess." 15  338          ATHALIAH. In an instant Benaiah was on his feet. Obeying the first impulse of his heart he exclaimed: "Woman! unsay those words, or I shall call thee liar to thy face!" "And why unsay them?" retorted Athaliah, rising to her full height, her flashing eye answering Benaiah's fiery glance, " since it was I she tricked! I, she stole from! and who, I more than half believe, put out the light of life of one dearer to me than my soul! Why unsay them? when, as    my soul liveth, and as the Lord liveth, they are the truth!" Benaiah sank back in his seat overpowered, covering his face in his hands. He could not believe Athaliah guilty of perjury, and what grounds had he for maintaining his mother's honor when he actually did not yet know who that  mother was. He felt he had been guilty of unwarrantable  harshness towards the woman who had so befriended him, and who, too, had received such injury from the author of A. his being. He was about framing words of apology, and re- quest for forgiveness, when he felt the cushions beneath him sink under an additional weight, and knew that Athaliah  was by his side. Gently she removed his hands, which  !g covered his face, and he saw that the fire had gone out, quenched by holy tears, so they seemed to him. In tones tremulous, with a softly subdued emotion, she proceeded :  "Benaiah, I know the agony of thy heart, for I suffer  with thee. Thy mother, who so deeply wronged me, added, g above all this, that she was closely related to me by blood-- that we were reared up as sisters."           ! A dawning light had stolen into Benaiah's soul. It streamed from the star-lit evening when he had held such i sweet converse with Ethni. It quivered in sombre flashes from the death-chamber where he had held in his arms the  fainting Rebekah, and had gazed with such regretful ten-  derness on the pallid features of the dead. He tried- to  speak, but Athaliah answered his thought: "Yes, Benaiah, thou hast divined the truth. Rebekah is thy mother; and the cold, pale form reposing in yonder house from all life s ills, was thy brother!" Strangely commingled were Benaiah's feelings on hearing these words of Athaliah, so full of import to his future life. Speak he could not, for speech is the utterance of connected thought, and his mind was a chaos of conflicting feelings.   THE ACCUSATION.        339      i There was a mournful regret for the brother he had lost, struggling for pre-eminence with an underlying joy that Miriam was now his, that would surge up and infuse itself into each counter-current of emotion; there was anger, if not contempt, for the mother who had borne him, but had done nothing else, disappearing at times beneath his re- collections of her gentle sadness and the air of purity that enveloped her like a mantle as she quietly moved about the sick room of her son. Then hope arose and threw her rosy light over the troubled waters of his soul. His mother might yet be innocent, and Athaliah still truthful; the one the dupe, and the other the victim, of some terrible mistake. "Art sure, Athaliah, that thou hast not been deceived? Such errors sometimes happen." "Listen, Benaiah," gently replied Athaliah, as she took his hand in hers, " and be thou the judge. A score of years ago I was -beloved, and loved in return one who prized me, as thou dost thy Miriam now. His name was Heber." Athaliah's tones grew tremulous as she slowly pronounced these last words. She paused a moment, as if to recover her composure, and then proceeded: "Heber had an elder brother, Elnathan--mark well the name, Benaiah, for it is of thy father I am speaking-who was betrothed to Rebekah, my cousin. We were cradled near each other in infancy, and, early orphaned, we grew up together 'neath the same roof as sisters, co-sharers in the thoughts and petty trials and unalloyed enjoyments of childhood, and the fuller, deeper emotions of later years. "While Heber and I waited for the date of our betrothal, fixed by my father, just before his death, thy parents were married; but in less than six months Rebekah became a widow. Soon after thy father's death, which was very sud- den, thy mother sought the dwelling of her foster-mother, who lived in the mountainous portion of Naphtali, there to pass the days of her mourning in solitude. Her hand- maid, Rizpah, was her only attendant. She remained ab- sent a year. Soon after her return, her guardian, who was also mine, demanded of Benoni, the father-in-law of Rebekah, the hand of his only remaining son, Heber, dearer to me than life itself. "Oh! Benaiah!I continued Athaliah, with a pathos that  340         ATHALIAH. moved his heart to its lowest depths, "'thou knowest by dread experience the anguish of having the loved one torn from thee by a law more terrible in its demands than death, for death is cold and chaste, and keeps jealous ward over the darlings of our souls, leaving us the sweet and living memories of the past, which this inexorable requirement of our religion forbids us to cherish. In this, Benaiah, we have suffered alike, but now mark well the difference! You bowed before a power over which man has no control, and are happy now in finding that such submission is no longer required. But picture to thyself, that this discovery had not been made, that Sarah had gained possession of thee, and Miriam been left alone; losing thy affection beyond recall. As Miriam would have been, I in reality was I "Athaliah rose to her feet as she continued: 1"Rebekah never had a claim to Heber: she robbed me of him. In the mountains of Naphtali she gave birth to thee, and abandoned thy help- less infancy to the care of, she knew not, cared not whom, for thou wert an obstacle in the path of her covetous, lust- ful desires she was determined to remove. Thus were my hopes, the bright and fragrant flowers of my life, all blasted. They were married!" Athaliah sank on the cushions by the side of Benaiah, as if overpowerd by her emotions. She had passed suddenly from a just anger to a profound grief. The rapid transition sensibly affected Benaiah, and though the narrative had been of absorbing interest to him, yet he could not but feel deep commiseration and sympathy for this injured and in- nocent woman. He did not for a moment doubt the truth of her words, for there was a symmetry and consistency about the narrative that stamped it as genuine. Hope, that had shown his heart glimpses for a moment of a future, lit up by a mother's love and- tenderness, fled, and all was dark again. Benaiah broke the silence by saying, in low tones: "Heber was, then, Ethni's father!" "Yes," gently replied Athaliah ; " and now, Benaiah, listen to the terrible conclusion of the history of deceit and wrong. When Ethni was about a year old, a violent altercation took place between Rebekah and her husband, occasioned by jealousy on her part. She vowed to be avenged. Shortly afterwards, a day or so, Heber was missed from the noon-    THE ACCUSATION.        341     : day meal. He was sought for in a place he often fre- quented, a summer-house in the garden, and there he was found lying on a rustic couch. The servant called him, but he answered not. The call was repeated, and in a louder tone. Still no answer. Benaiah," and Athaliah, placing her hand on his arm, pronounced the words with a clearhess that thrilled through him, "thunder would not have awakened him. He was dead! He had partaken of the morning meal in health, but soon after had complained of pains in the head. Benoni, the father of the poor victim, immedi- ately after the burial, left the country and became a wan- dering exile. What he suspected he never gave utterance to in words, but his acts gave louder, clearer evidence. 3Fe never spoke to Rebekah-never looked at her after this ter- rible event, which had brought such desolation on his housbe Rebekah, on behalf of the little Ethni, the legal heir to thev estate, after this abandonment by Benoni, sold it to the j nearest male relative, though a distant one, and removed to Jerusalem, where for many years, as thou knowest, she has borne the title of I the saintly.'-" Benaiah, as he listened to this terrible aspersion against his mother, grew ashy pale. His lip quivered, his eyes became distended, as if watching the slow but inevitable approach of some ghastly terror. In husky, agitated tones, he at length found utterance: "Oh! this cannot be! Her passion for Heber might have led her to the commission of a great wrong to gain possession of him; but to cast him, purchased at such a price, from her, and by murder! this surpasses belief!" Benaiah had risen as he uttered these words, and now stood before Athaliah with hands clasped, as if he still doubted, and was thus mutely begging her to dispel his fears. "Benaiah," calmly replied Athaliah, looking upon him with an expression of tender pity, "I am not telling thee of what others suspected, or of what my suspicions were. It is always well to know the truth. Learn, then, who this Benoni was, and see what grounds he must have had for making the sacrifice he did. He was no common character, but was a man among ten thousand. He enjoyed the well- deserved friendship of the great Samuel; and King Saul possessed no more valiant soldier than he. Early won by the heroic but modest virtues of the persecuted David, he   Z4A2         ATHALIAH. joined his desperate fortunes, and by his unwavering valor and devotion contributed in no small degree to his final ele- vation to the throne of Israel. Then declining kingly reward, he retired to the elegant repose of his home near Gibeah, there to spend his declining but sunny years among his chil- dren, whose love was more precious to him than all the hon- ors David could have bestowed upon him. Is it at all likely, then, that a man of such ripe judgment, and one who loved his country so well, and was so identified with its prosperity, would on light grounds have torn himself from its embrace,  and become a wandering exile in heathen lands? Were Benoni here- "  "Benoni is here!" Benaiah quickly turned and recognized in the venera- ble form pausing for an instant on the threshold of the apart- ment, the man who had so lately procured his liberation from the hands of the Philistines. CHAPTER VIII. THE WITNESS. ATHALIAH, who had sat facing the entrance to the apart-. ment, arose and hastened to meet her aged visitor; not with the ordinary courtesy bestowed upon the casual or ex- pected comer, but with the manner of one greeting a long- absent friend, whose face she as little expected to see again as if the clods of the valley had already covered it. In such meetings the heart seems to throw aside the slow and  formal medium of speech, and appeals to keener, quicker senses than hearing, to transmit its emotions-the eye, the touch, become its ready ministers! There was something approaching to solemnity in this si- lent meeting of two who for more than a score of years had not met, and who all that while had borne each their weight of sorrow, proceeding from the same cause. So Benaiahb deemed it, as he gazed on the bowed form of Athaliah, over which Benoni bent, one hand clasping hers, while the other was laid as if in blessing on her head. In the old man's   THE WITNESS.         OttoI eyes, dimmed more by sorrow than age, she had kept through all these years her virgin faith with his poor mur- dered Heber. Well might he bless her, then; well might he love her as a daughter! " Benaiah!" It was Athaliah who spoke, as still holding Benoni's hand she beckoned Benaiah to approach them. Taking his hand she placed it in Benoni's, and in clear thrilling tones said to him: "Benoni, this is the son of Elnathan and Rebekah!" In that single sentence she had told of Rebekah's crime, and of the foul wrong that had been done her, and yet she was only giving to Benoni his son's son. "It is, then, as I thought to find it!" exclaimed Benoni, pressing Benaiah to him in a warm embrace, and then hold- ing him at arm's length, and gazing intently at him as if try- ing to detect in his features the lineaments of his first-born son, EInathan. "Bless thee, my son " he fervently con- tinued, " and praised be the God of our fathers who led my steps to Gath to save thee from the hands of the Philis- tines!" "Didst know then, father," and Benaiah dwelt with a loving emphasis on the lord,s of our near relationship? , Certainly not, my son:!- Of its mere robability I have- only heard during the last half hour, and of its truth only now from the dear lips of this innocent sufferer;" and Benoni turned his eyes lovingly on Athaliah. "Let us be seated," he continued, " and I will relate first the circumstances that took me to the city of Gath, and then what has occurred since I arrived this morning in Jerusalem." Athaliah hastened to arrange the cushions. Benoni and Benaiah sat side by side, while she took a place directly op- posite, near enough to catch every phase of passing emotion on their features. Benoni then began:  "On the day during which the late battle waged so fiercely between the Israelites and the Philistines, there was another kind of war going on not far distant, of which I was an in- terested spectator. This was a war of the elements; the winds and waves battling together and tossing hither and thither in their rage a ship, in which I had embarked to cross the Great Sea from Greece to Egypt. Every effort  344         ATHALIAH. that strength and skill could put forth to enable us to out- ride the storm was tried, but all proved unavailing. We were driven ashore opposite the city of Ashdod. The ship was broken up by the fury of the waves, and the cargo lost, but happily no precious life went with it. Meeting with anything but friendly succor in Ashdod, I demanded of its 1 prince to be sent to Gath with my companions, about ten i miles distant, whose King I claimed as my friend H "We arrived there early in the morning of the day after i: our shipwreck, and the no less disastrous battle to the  Philistines. The city was full of soldiers, and many of the wounded had been brought there, for the field which had A been the scene of conflict was not very far distant. The  King, though maddened by the defeat, for he had been the principal commander, received me kindly and with welcome.  "Thou art surprised at this," continued Benoni. "Know,sl then, that when King David was obliged to dwell in the  land of the Philistines, I was one of his companions. Ash-  ish, the then King of Gath, showed us great kindness. His son, who is now King, was then just entering manhood, and  I secured his friendship, I scarcely know how. I did not  seek it, and never made any special effort to retain it, and  yet it remained; and what a blessing it has proved after if these long years! Ah! my son.! I thought it only acci-  dent that had led me there, deemed it mere chance, when I  heard that a young Jewish officer had been made prisoner ! in a night attack; and when I considered the temper of  the people, and feared his life might be sacrificed to appease their wrath, I only imagined I was fulfilling a simple dictate of ihumanity in pleading to the King for his liberation; 3 when, lo! I was begging the life and liberty of my first-  born's son, and it was God who had led me to that city by storm and tempest to accomplish this work! Praised be  His holy name!"  Benoni lifted his eyes to Heaven as he gave utterance to  this fervent adoration. Benaiah silently testified his emo-  tioni -by pressing the hand he still held within his own, while  on Athaliah's features rested an expression of angelic sym- pathy as she gazed upon them. After a moment's silence  Benoni proceeded:  "This morning I arrived in Jerusalem and went immedi- ately to what had once been the dwelling of my old friend   THE WITNESS.         345     '; Ahithophel, but was now occupied by his children. It was  to see Miriam that I called; nay, more, she was the attrac-  tion that had hurried me from the city of Gath. At some    , more fitting time I will tell thee, Benaiah, of this beautiful and noble maiden, who bears to me the affection of a daugh-  er, and of the circumstances that led to our acquaintance." A half smile flitted over Benaiah's face, but he made no reply. "We had not met for over a year, and how strange was  the intelligence with which she greeted me! Little did she imagine how full of import it was to me. Thou hast heard of the dying confession of Milcah, brought to Jerusalem by Haniel, and I need not repeat it. Think of the emotions it produced in me! At first I only felt kindly sympathy with  Miriam, that Zillah, in whom she had always been interested, had been so suddenly raised to rank and station. Then it  came into my mind like a flash of light, that at the time this strange event had happened in the mountains of Naph- tali, Rebekah had been there, and that her only attendant  was a hand-maid named Rizpah, a beautiful Arab girl. The correspondence thus far was complete, and tremblingly I  asked myself, have I found a son uncontaminated by the wiles  of the woman who made me for these long years an exile  from my beloved country? I did not communicate the sweet hope that was budding in my withered heart, but just  as I was making anxious enquiry where this Benaiah could be found, Zillah entered the room, and, in hurried, agitated  tones, told us that she had just met Benaiah at Rebekah's,  and that he had gone to the house of Athaliah to endeavor  to learn from Rizpah, whom he expected to find there, the  solution of the mystery that enveloped his birth. Thither I  hurried, Benaiah. Caleb recognized me, though he had not seen me for many years, and he allowed me to announce myself."  "Didst not Zillah tell thee that just before she left Re- bekah's house her son Ethni, my brother, had breathed his last?" enquired Benaiah. "She did not," replied Benoni, with a calmness that sur- prised his hearers, and then added, in a half musing tone, "and so he is dead!" "Yes, he died in consequence of wounds received in the late battle, " sadly responded Benaiah. 15*     346         ATHALIAH. "It was to see him, then, that thou wentst to Rebekah's house?" "It was. We spent the evening before the battle to- gether, and I learned from his mother just before his death that he had spent the entire night in company with Miriam's brothers in searching for me. Father, I loved him as a brother, though not knowing him to be such." A slight frown shadowed Benoni's face, which only the observant Athaliah noticed; the interview was fast assuming an absorbing interest for her. "Did Rebekah acknowledge thee as her son, when Zillah told thee of Milcah's confession in her presence?" There was an increasing sternness in Benoni's tones as he continued to speak of Rebekah. "She did not," uneasily replied Benaiah. "I only learned the secret of my parentage from Athaliah, a few moments before thy entrance." Benoni fixed his eyes on the yet beautiful features of Athaliah, but the gaze which answered his was as open and unmoved as truth and innocence could make it. "And how long, Athaliah, hast thou known this?" "For many and long years," was the calm reply. "And thou hast never divulged it until now!" "Never, and now only to the one who had the right to de- mand it of me. Why should I have made it known? I did not seek to be avenged on the guilty Rebekah. For the wrong she had done me, she could never have made re- paration." "But thou mightst," retorted Benoni, in eager, trembling tones, "have restored my own to me! Oh! the weary, weary hours he would have lightened and made glad for me in my lone wanderings " "Thou never soughtst me," gently answered Athaliah. "Ah! if thou hadst come to me, thou mightst have shared my secret, as thou didst my sorrow!" The memories of the dying chamber of Ethni were busy in Benaiah's brain. Again he saw the pale and placid fea- tures of what appeared to him the ministering angel of his suffering brother. She a murderess! With an abruptness which was so only outwardly, for the enquiry he was about to make sprang from his anxious thoughts, he exclaimed: "Father, just before thy entrance, Athaliah told me of    THE WITNESS.        3,7     [i: Heber's sudden death, ahd that dark suspicions fell on Re- bekah as the-oh! I cannot pronounce the word! Tell me, in mercy, that whatever other weakness or crime she might have been guilty of, that her soul has not been blackened by murder!" "Calm thyself, my son, and be content to forget as soon as may be such a woman as Rebekah-I will not say thy mother-exists. Nearly twenty years of my life spent in exile is the accusation that rises up against her. I need say nothing more." "But, father, may there not be some fearful misconcep- tion on thy part? Oh! think what it is to say to the son: 'thy mother-for she is my mother, say what thou wilt- is a murderess!" "Benaiah," kindly replied the old man, much moved by the agonizing tone in which his young kinsman spoke, " often have I asked myself that very question, and as often have I summoned from the past each circumstance that could in- fluence, even most remotely, that terrible event, and after every such examination the conviction has forced itself upon me that my first impression was correct. Forget, then, Benaiah, that such a woman lives in the same world with us." "Be it so," responded Benaiah, gloomily; "I will never see her again!" "But, Benaiah," interrupted Athaliah, in soft and gentle accents, " thou wilt perform a brother's part in committing to the grave the body of Ethni!" ' Yes, I will perform the last sad duties to my dear brother;" and then turning to Benoni he continued, taking his hand, "Father, tell Miriam of the deep sorrow that has fallen on me-tell her all, keep nothing from her. I will not see her till after the burial of my poor brother. Then, if she will accept as a husband the son of a murderess-thou seest I can say the word now-we will seek some spot whose air is uncontaminated by the presence of this saintly Re- bekah!" The -increasing astonishment of Benoni at these words, at length found utterance in speech: "Miriam-tell her all-accept thee as a husband! Oh! my poor son, has thy trouble, then, crazed thee?" "Nay, father!" and a sickly smile flitted over Benaiah's  348          ATHALIAH H face as he replied: "Since thou last saw'st Miriam, our acquaintance has been formed and ripened into love. Twice we have been on the eve of betrothal, and twice has the chalice of happiness been dashed from our lips; and now-" "Oh! this is more joy than I looked for," interrupted Be. noni, his venerable features lit up with pleasant anticipations; "my weary wanderings shall cease now, for I have again found a home. Go, Benaiah, my more than ever son, and fulfil thy duties as the elder brother, and I will hasten back to Miriam. God bless thee, Athaliah, and make thy days happy as I hope my few remaining ones will prove!" After Benoni and Benaiah had left the house, Athaliah slowly paced- the room in which they had left her. A mock- ing and triumphant smile was on her lips, and her thoughts, if given the utterance of speech, would have run thus: "Ah! Rebekah! look to thyself now! One son lying cold and stiff before thee, and the other about to hiss into thy ear the accusation of murderess! The old do- tard arrived in admirable time to fasten conviction of Re- bekah's guilt in the son's mind! Satan has not deserted me after all. Yes; this is better than Rizpah's plan of Cain and Abel; better than the blood that only flows out- wardly. I will make the heart bleed at every pore! When Rebekah has survived this shock, and is hoping still to pre- serve the secret of her crime, then all Israel shall know what a sham her life has been. But how best to accomplish this?" As if in answer to the thought, Rizpah entered. Atha- liah was unusually gracious, although intentions had already commenced forming themselves in her mind of ridding her- self in some way of her now useless confederate, as she thought her. She minutely recounted all that had trans- pired, giving peculiar prominence to' the fact of Ethni's death, and of her ingenuity in reminding Benaiah of the part he ought to take in the ceremonies of the burial, thus bring- ing the mother and son again together. "And now, Rizpah," concluded Athaliah, "it only re- mains to devise some plan of giving widest publicity to Re- bekah's crimes of child-abandonment, sacrilege, fraud and murder I A goodly catalogue! I have some orders to give Caleb, and will see thee again."   RrRIBUTION.          349  "Yes; we will plan first for Rebekah's ruin," muttered Rizpah when left alone; " and then, Athaliah, thy turn will come , "  CHAPTER IX. RETRIBUTION. WHLE Benaiah waited in the vestibule of Rebekah's house for admission, he reflected for the first time on the difficulties of his position. What was he to say, when the servant came in answer to his summons? In what character was he to appear in that house of mourning? Certainly not as the nearest male relative of the deceased, and the bereaved widow, mourning her only son. Then what right had he to present himself there at all, before the final pre- parations of the burial were made? The door opened, and the sad face of the servant, who stood in the opening thus made, seemed silently but respect- fully to ask this very question. Benaiah was about to speak, when he heard his name pronounced in familiar tones, and looking beyond the servant,- he saw at the extremity of the hall, with the light from the inner court falling around him, the silvery-haired priest, Haniel. Their meeting was cordials for though the very air seemed to speak of the chilling mystery of death taberna- cled in those walls, yet each recalled their last interview and thought how happily its gloom had since been dispelled. A hearty embrace, a kindly gleam of the eye, told of the priest's congratulation, and then he spoke of the dread re- ality of the place and hour. He had just learned of the death of Ethni, and had come to offer consolation and sympathy to the afflicted mother, whom he had long known and highly esteemed. But her grief was so profound that it made her, like royalty, inaccessible. While the priest was speaking in subdued tones, they paced slowly to and fro the inner court. The first emotions called up by the unexpected meeting over, Benaiah, only half listening to Haniel's words, became immersed again in the     RETRIBUTION.   troublous sea of thought. How little the venerable man be- side him knew of the real position of affairs. He had come to offer consolation to Rebekah, as to one whom he respected, mayhap, to the daughter he loved. How terribly could he ruffle the benign serenity of the priest by merely whispering into his ear the full import of the message he had brought from the dying Milcah. That instead of being there as a con- soler of the afflicted mother, he was in fact bearer of the intelligence that proclaimed her ignominy and shame. Benaiah, chancing to look up, caught a glimpse of a pallid face that appeared for an instant at an upper window look- ing into the court. A few moments later a servant came to them and announced that his mistress would receive Ben- aiah. "CGo, my son," said Haniel, after a momentary feeling of surprise had left him; "thou wert the friend and comrade of her dead son, and art fitter to speak words of comfort from thy young experience than I am from the wealth of years! Go, and may God bless thee, and make thy visitation a source of peace to this poor sufferer!" What a terrible mockery these words seemed to Benaiah! There was good reason, he thought, beyond the profundity of Rebekah's grief, for her refusal to admit Haniel to her pres- ence. She would naturally shrink from meeting the man who, though unwittingly, had brought from its hidden sheath the weapon that might yet destroy her. How strangely the guilt and hypocrisy of the woman contrasted with the truth and simplicity of the priest, while Benaiah appeared to himself to be in some way a sharer in the sins of the former, because his lips were as effectually sealed as were hers. Go, of course, he must. To refuse would necessitate a full explanation of the mystery that hung around him like a cloud, and that, he could not, would not do. He therefore followed the servant, who conducted him to an apartment, and, without entering, told him that his mis- tress would join him presently. At first, Benaiah thought the room was without an occupant, it was so hushed; but, on glancing around, he saw a bier, pall-covered. It was not necessary for him to trace the still proportions of the form that lay beneath it, to learn who it was that was thus coldly waiting his burial. He knew just how that white face   would look when its covering was removed; nay, he already saw it gleaming on him from the recesses of his memory. Was it through a mistake of the servant, or from design of Rebekah, that he had been placed there for an interview with her? This was the question of but a moment. Flow- ing over all bitter thoughts, came a gush of tender and mournful feeling for the brother he had lost as soon as found, and, advancing with eager yet trembling steps towards the bier, he knelt beside it, and gently laying aside the pall, kissed the cold, hard brow, murmuring in broken tones, "My brother-my dear, dear brother!" Was it long that he thus knelt, scanning with love's de- spairing scrutiny the treasure he had lost? He knew not; neither did he hear the unsteady foot-falls that approached him, heeded not the deep sigh that seemed to rend in twain the heart of the grief-bowed mother, looking down upon her sons ; the one, for ever cold to affection's tenderest caress, yet silent and unmoved; the other, instinct with young life's emotions, mayhap with life's bitterest reproaches for the un- natural parent who in infancy had abandoned him. A hand, white as the face of the dead, rests gently on Benaiah's head. He starts to his feet, as if the touch had infused a new and different life in him. A rapid glance at the mother of the dead, moves in him the strange impulse of replacing the pall, as if the placid repose of the sleeper was too holy for her gaze. Happily Rebekah did not so interpret it. She extended her hand for the warm pressure of kindly sympathy, while her heart yearned to clasp him to her bosom, but how tell the son the story of the mother's shame! No answering motion on Benaiah's part, and Rebekah's hand falls listlessly by her side. The chill mists of the coming tempest are creeping slowly up, cold and damp, enveloping her heart in unwelcome embrace. She essays to speak, but her tones are trembling and hesitating: ' Benaiah, this tender solicitude for my dead son is very dear to me." "I am here only," was the stern response, " to fulfil life's last duties to my brother I These accomplished, we part, and for ever!"    352    ,     ATHALIAHo              = The blow had fallen, icy and crushing as mountain ava-  lanch; but Rebekah did not yield. In a moment there passed into her heart the strength of a great despair. A cry rang through the chambers of her soul, rousing to active energy all the resources of her. being. Her son must be gained now, or be for ever lost to her--lost in a deeper and more terrible sense than the one lying coldly impassive to all the agitation surging around him. "Oh! Benaiah, my son! my son! Wilt thou not forgive me and call me 'mother?' See, on my knees I implore thee!" The wretched mother sank down between the living and the dead, her hands outstretched in touching entreaty ; but  not less immovable was the one son than the other!    : 4 Oh! Benaiah! couldst thou feel the hunger of the soul I suffer, thou wouldst take thy poor mother to thine heart!"  "Didst thou take me to thine, when in helpless infancy  thou castest me away from thee as a worthless object?" A gleam of light dawned into Rebekah's darkened heart. ! Her son misjudged her. The truth she so feared might yet X win him to her love, for it was less hideous than this lying X phantom some enemy had pictured to him. In her eager- ness to exculpate herself, she rose to her feet, and in clear, earnest tones, replied: "Benaiah, I did not cast thee from me. One in whom I  d placed implicit confidence told me that thou diedst at thy very birth. Oh! my son, believe me, for I call God to wit- ':X ness the truth of what I say: had this horrid deceit not X been practised on me, and hadst thou been placed in these arms, I would have taken thee to my heart, and asked for ! no greater blessing! i" ' "Yet didst thou rob Athaliah of her lover, knowing in  i thy heart that thou hadst no rightful claim to him!" "Benaiah, that was no sin against thee," gently replied Rebekah, " and oughtst thou to call thy mother to account for a sin I hope God has forgiven me?"  Benaiah's dark eyes flashed beneath his knitted brow, as pointing with outstretched arm and extended finger to the bier on which his dead brother lay, he said:  "And should God ask at thy hands the life of his father, . as He once asked C(ain for the life of his brother, what couldst thou say? Wouldst thou imitate the insolence, as I   RETRIBUTION.        353     i t  well as the crime, of the first murderer, and cry: Am I his I keeper?" "' Rebekah reeled beneath this terrible and unexpected   Ai blow. Her son, whom she hoped might, by some undeserved   : mercy of God, be brought to replace the one she had lost,   deemed her a murderess! Her ashy lips moved, but no     ; sound issued from them. She raised her eyes to Heaven, but saw no answering smile of consolation there. Each lineament of her face told of the deep anguish of her soul, and Benaiah grew sick at heart as he gazed upon her. Then she slowly, feebly, turned away, and, sinking down beside the bier of her son, pillowed her head upon the cold bosom of the dead. Well might the heart of Benaiah sicken at the sight of those agonized features, seen but for a moment, but stamped A for ever on his soul. Rebekah had strained every fibre of her being to its greatest tension for this strange conflict, in which the affection or hate of a son was to be the terrible :i issue of the struggle. Suddenly all strength and hope had given way, and her despairing look towards Heaven was but the last glance given by the drowning on the things of earth, ere sinking beneath the waves that had conquered  i in the unequal strife.                    i Benaiah shuddered, as the thought flashed on him, that . the accusation he had hurled at his mother, and the full ef- ! feats of which he could not foresee, might be false. She had denied, and called on God to witness the truth of her asser- j tion, the crime of child-abandonment, and might she not be innocent of the greater sin laid at her door! A presenti-  l ment that he had committed a great wrong against the au- thor of his being stole into his heart. His only desire was to retrace the steps he had so hastily and recklessly taken, to undo if possible the error of which he had been guilty. He sprang to his mother's side, and, stooping down, gently tried to raise her. "Mother'! mother I If I have accused thee falsely, forgive me." A pale face turned and gleamed upon him. "Hush! hush! thou wilt awaken him. See how calmly he sleeps. Oh! I am so weary that I would sleep too; but I must watch, watch, watch!" A cold thrill of horror ran through Benaiah's veins. A     O04:         ATHALH A; if determined to stifle at its birth the conviction that her reason had fled, he strove to rouse her. "Mother! It is thy son, Benaiah, who speaks to thee-- who is here to love and protect thee!" He passed his arms gently yet strongly around her droop-  ing form and raised her to his breast. "Benaiah! who is Benaiah? I have only one son, Ethni,  and he has fallen asleep. Do not awake him. Let him rest." i "I, too, mother, am thy son," urged Benaiah, sick at heart, 4 as he saw only in his mother's eyes the death of the soul. Rebekah seemed to be making an effort to recall some- i thing long forgotten. Then, in a hurried whisper, murmured close to Benaiah's ear: "He died-they told me he died! I never saw him!"  Then suddenly, and in elevated tones, she exclaimed: "Where is that dreadful woman that murdered my hus- band? I saw her poison his cup, but I didn't know then that she had done it. Oh! no, no! and afterwards she would not let me tell! Dost thou know why? And how came she    i  here to accuse me of it? Thou wilt not let her come near I me again, wilt thou, JEthni?"H Rebekah placed her arms lovingly around Benaiah's neck as she mentioned the name of her dead son, though alive now to her crazed fancy.            - Though Benaiah was obliged to admit to himself that the i shock Rebekah had experienced, following so closely the heavy grief occasioned by the loss of Ethni, had unseated  her reason, he still hoped its abdication would be but temrn- porary, and in the meanwhile hailed with gratitude to God this fancy that had taken possession of his mother's mind, , that he was the one who. in reality lay dead near her.  i Fearing that a sight -of the dead would put this idea to  flight, he gently lured his mother's steps from the room.  Again she complained of weariness, in the language and tones of a child, and, even as a child might do, she pillowed her head on the bosom of her son and sank into a gentle slumber. Benaiah gazed on the pallid, placid features of his mother with something holier and deeper than the affection of the son, for combined with it was the tenderness and careful solicitude of the protester. Of the probabilities of her guilt   RETRIBUTION.         355 he had ceased to think. fWhatever it might have been, it had brought terrible punishment. He had only one thought now-to devote his entire life, if need be, to the support and protection of his mother. It was the only soothing reflec- tion he had, that such devotion and forgetfulness of self might partially atone for the terrible wrong he feared he had done her. Soon came intruding on his busy brain, thoughts of the difficulties that surrounded him. He could not long remain thus. Easy enough to announce to Rebekah's household that the reason of its mistress had succumbed to the over- whelming grief that had assailed her, but how long would the secret remain confined within the narrow bounds it now occupied, if the itching ears and busy tongues of menials were allowed access to it, by the unguarded speech of Re- bekah. And what known right had he to assume authority, and say who should, or who should not, approach his mother? The right he had, but to announce it would be at once to    l proclaim the secret. He thought of Benoni. He, as father-in-law of Rebekah, and grandfather of Ethni, could very properly assume con-    O trol, and in calling on him the secret need go no further. But, as Benaiah recalled the secret interview in the house   ! of Athaliah, he abandoned all idea of asking his assist- ance. Should he ask his mother's cousin, Athaliah, to lay aside all feelings of animosity, now that God's punish- ment had fallen so heavily on Rebekah, and come and aid them?   A feeling something akin to pride answered    ? "no." Miriam had her household ties, and, besides, he  . shrank instinctively even from requiring of her a temporary assistance. Was there none, then, within the household-some faith- ful retainer who had been long in Rebekah's service, and    I who in the pressing emergency could be trusted? But who could give him this needed information? The name     I of Zillah came like an inspiration to his thought! She     I might assume the office herself. She was Miriam's friend, and therefore his. But how summon her. Rebekah still slept-his breast      j her pillow. He dreaded calling her from the sweet oblivion in which she rested. Gently, then, as ever mother laid down a sleeping infant, he disengaged himself from the not unwel-     J00          ATHALIAH iE come burden, and left her reposing on the couch on which they had been sitting. To dispatch a servant for Zillah was but the work of a few moments, and on returning to the chamber where he had left his mother, he found her still sleeping. By her side he  kept vigil till Zillah was announced. The messenger had taken the summons to her as if it had proceeded from Rebe- kah. Great, then, was her surprise, her horror, when Benaiah told her that Rebekah had been suddenly bereft of reason; that she was gentle as a child, but lacked even a child's  discernment; that she had sunk to sleep believing him to be X her son Ethni-not restored to life, but never dead! What i her awaking would be, he dreaded to conjecture.     X "-Zillah, I have sent for thee to ask of thee a great favor, ! and to confide to thy keeping a sacred trust. In this very chamber, not many hours since, thou madest a strange an- X nouncement. Now hear the sequel to it, which I have learned  since that time. That woman sleeping there is my mother i " Zillah's first impulse was to congratulate Benaiah, but she : quickly thought of what had just been told to her, and the smile of pleasure melted into an expression of sadness, and she could only murmur in low tones : "Oh! this is indeed dreadful! A mother lost as soon as found! But let us hope that this delirium will be but tern- porary!" "Thanks, Zillah, for thy kind sympathy; but listen while I confide to thee a secret, which, if once widely known, would make my mother's confirmed delirium something, for her sake at least, to be desired." It was far from the manner of a collected and unimpas- sioned narrative that Benaiah told his companion the story of his mother's shame. He could not banish from his mind that Zilliah had heretofore filled the position of a menial, and that it was his mother who had been the indirect cause  of depriving her of the name he had hitherto borne, and  of the home all the privileges of which he had enjoyed. There she stood with no cause to blush, either for herself or  for the parents whose child she was, and he must humble, himself to ask her to minister to and protect from a too  eager curiosity the woman she had so much cause to exe- crate. It was not till Benaiah came to unfold the story that   RETRIBUTION.        357 the true position of affairs forced themselves upon him. But for the ready sympathy of Zillah, and the extreme ur- gency of the situation, he would have drawn back-left the recital unfinished, and sought for aid of some one who had not been made a life-long sufferer by the very woman for whom she was called upon to make additional sacrifices. But Zillah, so far from repelling Benaiah, soothed his way by finding palliation and excuses for his mother's conduct, that evinced how thoroughly she had forgiven all. And when he had finally nerved himself to make the request he had de- signed-modified, however, to extend only temporary assist- ance-what was his surprise and gratification to hear Zillah answer thus: "Not simply for a few weeks, Benaiah, but for life, if it is God's will that the malady of this poor sufferer be perma- nent. Death a short time since deprived me of the only near relative I possessed. I have therefore no home ties to bind me to other duties, and I therefore devote myself to the care and well-being of thy mother. She shall be mine, Benaiah." Zillah's eyes filled with tears as she extended her hand to Benaiah, which he warmly clasped. Her bowed head con- cealed the blush that tinged her cheeks, for a voice within  I her whispered the reason of the self-abnegation she had    I promised. It was a vow made rather to the dead one lying in the adjoining chamber, than the one sleeping in her sight. The motive, though mixed, was still holy. Her purpose, however, was too deeply laid for her to suffer more than a temporary confusion in reflectingo that Benaiah deemed her act nought but an impulse of pure benevolence and human- ity, since she could not undeceive him and show what a bond of close relation existed between them. Pure from all sensual dross- as was her love for Ethni, she could not avow it, but she could cherish it now, cherish it by daily acts of self-denial and love and tenderness to the mother he would ;: himself, if living, have so tended;, and it was no vain thought that he might be looking down from the pure heavens, bend- ing over them with a thankful smile-no senseless longing that she might yet meet him and be acknowledged by him    i in the bright Hereafter.     o o          ATHALIAH o CHAPTER X. THE MASK REMOVED. A WEEK has elapsed-a week eventful, if not in new occurrences, still in results flowing from causes already existing. Rebekah, on waking, found Benaiah and Zillah watching  over her. To their hushed expectancy she answered by  i addressing Benaiah as "Ethni!" This idea seemed there- fore to be fixed, but a stranger hallucination followed. She  regarded Zillah as her hand-maid, as she had been of old,d and chided her, yet gently, for her absence, and promised to : be less exacting than she had been, and more indulgent. X So gentle and yielding had she become that it required  but little persuasion to induce her to go to Gibeon with Zillah, and remain there till the burial of Ethni could take place. How little Benaiah thought of the self-denial it oc-  casioned Zillah thus to absent herself from Jerusalem at ii such a time. But she went away unmurmuring, both in voice and heart. But before going she had a long interview with Miriam, 0 and placed the narrative of Rebekah's errors in the most  favorable light that love could furnish. Miriam was easily convinced that Rebekah's chief culpability lay in the fact  that she had deprived Athaliah of her lover when she knew g she had no claim to him, and surely for this she was suf- ficiently punished.  Of wilful child abandonment, they deemed her innocent; of murder, neither of them had for a moment thought her guilty. And so, when Benaiah and Miriam met, it was with a  depth of joy that needed no words, no explanations, only to be enjoyed. The proximity of death did not disturb this tran- I : quillity of feeling, for the peace in their hearts was that of the mariner who rests quietly in a secure haven after expe- rience of a well-nigh overwhelming tempest, not exultant nor lightly exuberant, but calm, as resting on Him who is the Ruler of all storms. Wrecks lay around them on the shore, and the angry swell of the only half-subsided storm still surged, yet would time allay this and bring them for sep-   THE MASK REMOVED.        359 aration, union; for dark forebodings, bright anticipations; for trouble, unutterable peace. Miriam, in her turn, became Rebekah's advocate with Benoni, and though the settled convictions of long years were not lightly to be done away, yet he looked upon her affection as one lifting her above and beyond all human judgment; and burying the past, he looked calmy forward to the years that God would still mete out to him with hope and holy joy. And so everything seemed working out a peaceful, happy future. The secret acted rather as a bond of union than a thing to dread. Athaliah could be counted on as themselves, so they reasoned. Rizpah could have no motive in reveal- ing an occurrence in which she was the guiltiest, if not the only guilty party. Athaliah and Rizpah! They are together in an apart- ment of Athaliah's house! Each have known for several days of Rebekah's insanity, but this is the fir'st interview worthy of the name that they have held. Rizpah has often sought one, but Athaliah as steadily has avoided granting it, and the scene now about enacting has resulted from an enforced entrance of the Arab woman upon the privacy of one so far her superior in rank and opulence. There is, therefore, but anger half-concealed on the one side, and a spirit of defiance lurking 'neath the assumed manner of deference on the other. "Well, Rizpah! what wouldst thou?" was the ungra- cious reception of Atlialiah. "A strange question, Athaliah!" was the firm yet respect- ful reply of Rizpah, "and one I never recollect hearing from thee before." "That may be; but the relations between us are changed. Thou hast heard of Rebekah's insanity? Further pursuit of her, therefore, is out of the question." "I do not acknowledge that!  Thy hate must be weak, thy desire for revenge easily satisfied, if thou canst be con- tent with what is peace to her, for she does not suffer! Delirium has even restored the dead to her!" "And'hast thou come here to tell me thou canst restore reason to her for the sake of applving some new torture?" was the jeering response of Athaliah. I have come, Athaliah," replied Rizpah, still calmly but     360          ATHALIAH. with a growing firmness that bordered on defiance," as I have often come to thee before, to consult on some new steps to be taken to meet this fresh emergency. Ethni is dead, and Rebekah, may be, incurably bereft of reason, but her insanity may be made to take a far different form than what it now assumes. Besides, there is Benaiah left, her son. Surely thou art not content to have him flaunting his hap- piness in the light of day over the ashy embers of thy perished hopes!" There was a pause of a few moments in the hushed apart- ment. Rizpah was willing to wait the effect of her words, for Athaliah seemed deeply to ponder them. Her reflec- tions, however, were of a very different description. What- ever plans she might have for the future, or whether she was on the point of giving up all schemes of vengeance, one  thing she was resolved upon-to cast loose entirely from [? Rizpah. This meeting she determined should be the last, X and she was only pondering on the best way of conveying her unalterable decision to the woman who combined so strangely the position of friend, or at the least ally and in- ferior, if not menial.  Athaliah, though feeling herself sufficiently strong to crush Rizpah, if need be, still resolved on using the mildest a means compatible with her fixed purpose. It was, there- fore, with a gentleness that surprised Rizpah, that she an- swered:  "Rizpah, we had better part-nay, must part. I leave   thee free to follow thy own inclinations, and of course de- mand the same right of thee. We have been allies, but can be so no longer. I bear thee no ill will, but am willing, nay, desirous of compensating thee for thy past assistance in gold. Hereafter, though we may be friends in heart, we must be but as strangers to each other." A transitory flush deepened the swarthy tints of Rizpah's cheek as she took in the full meaning of these words. c"Pa- tience!" she whispered to her heart. Athaliah had some- times evinced caprice, and mayhap this was naught else, though clothed in such calm, firm language. "As for thy gold, Athaliah, thou knowest I need it not; though far from being rich, my tastes are simple, and I have enough. Thy friendship I highly prize, and cannot easily forego it. If I have done ought to offend thee, tell me of   THE MASK REMOVED.        361 it, and I will strive to amend it. But surely thou canst not really mean to sunder entirely a connection that has so long existed?" "Rizpah, I do most firmly mean it! Must I remind thee of our difference in blood, to say nothing of rank, to show thee that only something out of the common course could ever have brought us together, and that this cause having ceased to operate, it is natural we should each resume our proper position and become strangers again?" The manner was still gentle, but the words were none the less cutting. The flush that once again deepened the color of Rizpah's cheek remained fixed, and a fire slowly kindled in her eye as she replied: "But, Athaliah, suppose that I am not content to be cast thus aside as a soiled garment, what then?" "Thy consent is of little moment!" contemptuously re- torted Athaliah, all the rancor of her character aroused at the first show of opposition on Rizpah's part. "Beware how thou exhaust'st the little patience I have left,!" "And what might happen, I pray thee, if thy patience should give out?" There was a tremor in Rizpah's tones, but not of fear; her breath came quick, but it was the panting of a force held in check struggling to free itself. Athaliah regarded the eager, steady gaze of the Arab woman with curling lip and mocking eye, either blind to the evidences of an illy-curbed rage in Rizpah, that might prove dangerous when it burst forth, or else utterly despis- ing it. "Many things might happen; the most probable, having thee lashed like a dog from my door!" The room in which these women confronted each other-- the one beautifully delicate and attired with richness and taste, the other coarsely clad, and with features, though * regular, still bronzed and rugged through exposure, yet with freedom and strength of limb, the result of daily exercise- was a species of tower elevated a single story above the roof of the house. The window on the side nearest Atha- liah looked directly on the street. Beside the door by which Rizpah entered there was but one other, that leading to the roof of the house, with its surrounding battlements. "Ah! sayest thou so I " hissed forth the infuriated Riz- 16     362          ATHALIAH.  pah, "then break forth the suppressed rage of a score of years! and know, proud woman, that the hate I bear thee is even deadlier than that which I bore and still bear against X thy cousin Rebekah!"  Athaliah started back a step at this outhreak of vehement rage. She quailed before the clenched hand, the infuriated eye and quivering lips, paled with intensity of passion.  Still, though she descried danger in her position, her courage did not forsake her. She was in her own house, and the room, though retired, was within call of her servants. Caleb would hurl her enemy from the battlements at her word. It was, therefore, with some degree of firmness that she said, when Rizpah paused, after her first outhreak:    "What meanest thou, Rizpah, by this violence of speech?" "It means death to thee, woman of a vile ancestry!" ex- claimed Rizpah with a fierce vehemence that needed no ac-  companying gesture to make it appalling. "Think not to X escape me! Cry out, and before thy tones can reach the X ears of thy helpers, this dagger will be in thy heart!"  As Rizpah pronounced these words, she rapidly drew from her bosom a dagger. The hand that clenched it was strong, and every muscle and nerve of the terrible woman was in full play, to obey the slightest motion of the fierce will that ruled over them. But she did not strike. Her eyes seemed devouring Athaliah, to catch every indication of terror her words and actions were calculated to excite. Under such circumstances, time was everything to Atha- liah, and it was with a relief that changed quickly to cour- age and coolness, that she noticed this pause in her antago- nist. She had noted, too, Rizpah's singular words, " woman of a vile ancestry." This hate, then, that thirsted so for blood to slake it, might not be personal towards her. "Rizpah, put up thy dagger and hear me. What wrong have I ever done thee, that thou shouldst seek my life. I do not speak to thee of the sure and speedy punishment that would assail thee, wert thou to imbrue thy hands in my blood, but I appeal to thy sense of justice. Tell me, then, if I have ever knowingly injured thee?" "Thou knowest my hatred to thy cousin Rebekah. Know thou that the same reason exists, and has existed, for these long years for my hatred for thee, deepened by being obliged to appear as thy inferior, if not thy menial. I tell   THE MASK REMOVED.        363 thee again, that thy life is. numbered only by minutes; that thou wilt never leave this room by thy own power. The point of this dagger is so envenomed, that a little scratch would cause thy death. Hope nothing from any expected waver- ing or feebleness of purpose in me 1 Despair! Despair! Athaliah, is all that is left thee now. Would that I could spill all the blood of thy vile race, as I am about to shed thine." And still the blow came not! Rizpah, satisfied that Atha- liah was wholly in her power, prolonged the agony that she might gloat over the sufferings of her ere-while patroness and ally. Athaliah glanced through the window. The sun was shining brightly, and all around her was busy life. Within the walls were devoted retainers, one particularly, Caleb, who, if there, would shield her life at the expense of his own. Must she, then, die? Was that room to witness her death agonies? Was there no way out of this terrible position? One moment it seemed impossible to die thus-she with all the appliances of wealth and power-at whose mere caprice no less a mighty man than Joab would act; but when she looked on Rizpah with her drawn dagger, and saw the fixed, relentless purpose gleaming in her eye, a chill as of death crept through her veins. Suddenly, like a voice telling it to her, came the thought that there was a way which might lead her to safety. Con- cealed by the hangings on the side of the apartment near- est her was a passage that led by a staircase to the roof. Once there, she could at some risk drop on to the roof of the house and thence gain access to her household and be saved. In order to get near this haven of safety without exciting the terrible suspicion of the vigilant Rizpah, she commenced urging with impassioned gesture for mercy. "Oh! Rizpah! spare me! spare me! Life is still pleasant to me! I will do all thy bidding. My riches shall be thine--my power thine! Rizpah! I cannot die! death is so dreadful-" Athaliah raised her hands to her face and retreated a step or two as if to shut out or avoid the terrible spectre she was confronting. Then with the quick motion of a bird she turned and disappeared behind the hangings. Rizpah with a howl of rage sprang after her, and like her     364         ATHALIAH.  disappeared behind the tapestry. The room was tenantless and hushed, save with the muffled sounds of hurrying    footsteps. Then through the stillness vibrates a shriek of such despairing agony that seemingly a life-time of woe  X might have been compressed within it. It is very brief, and e terminates in a gasp. The next moment Rizpah appears   i with the dagger in her hand dripping with blood!      'Fool that I am," she muttered; "I killed her too quick. i A scratch with the dagger's point would have been better!"  Behind her in the narrow passage-way lies extended the lifeless form of Athaliah, the face upturned, and on its 4 frozen features imprinted the agonizing look that settled i there when she found her egress barred, and turning, saw Rizpah confronting her with flashing eye and distended  ! nostril-dagger firmly clenched and upraised for the fatal X blow!  "Shall I escape? Is life worth further pursuing?" was ! Rizpah's unuttered thought. The answer to this first question came to her unexpectedly. The door opened and on its threshold stood Caleb, and behind him rose the proud and towering form of Joab, whom he was about to usher to Athaliah's presence. But there was no Athaliah there now,  waiting the devotion of either servant or lover; only Rizpah, with flushed face and glittering eye, still holding in her hand the bloody dagger!  CHAPTER XI. A REVELATION,. CALEB was the first to comprehend the true meaning of the scene that so unexpectedly presented itself. He knew his mistress had been in the room, and the presence of Rizpah at the entrance of the passage leading to the roof, with such convincing evidence of guilt in her hands, gave rise in his heart to the most painful apprehensions. He sprang forward with a cry of horror, and regardless of danger thrust the Arab woman aside, and entered the passage-way. Instantly arose the wailing cry of:   A REVELATION.        365 " Oh! my poor mistress, my poor murdered mistress!" Joab hearing the cry, began to take in a sense of what had transpired. He strode hastily forward, and his eyes soon beheld a scene that, stern warrior as he was, made his heart sink within him. In the dim reddened light he saw Caleb on his knees supporting the lifeless head of the woman he loved. He had often looked on death, but never in such aspect as this; and so different were the impres- sions he received, that it seemed to him something more real and terrible than what he had usually regarded as the end of life. It was a strange sight to see these two men, so widely separate in worldly estimation, and occupying so diverse rela- tions to the woman lying dead before them-the one the lover, the other the servant-bowed by the same grief, swayed by the same devotion. As Caleb's love was the more child- like in its purity and simplicity, so like a child he wept and made lamentation. Joab's breast heaved and his lip quivered, but no sound issued. His eyes were humid, but no tears welled into them. And yet there was no thought, no desire for immediate vengeance! The blow had come with such suddenness, and was so terribly effective, that his simple thought was "Athaliah is dead!" Rizpah made no efforts to escape, and when Joab, rousing himself to action, turned hastily and re-entered the room, he found Rizpah standing by a window, carefully cleaning the murderous weapon upon a silken scarf which Joab re- cognized as one that belonged to his lost love. His first impulse was to snatch it from her. All her reply to this action was a cool, steady, mocking look, that seemed for a moment to petrify him. He could not conceive of anything human so hardened! Was she an imp of Satan? Now there come sounds of hurrying footsteps, and mtur- murs of mingling voices. Caleb's cries have been heard, and the mysterious influence that emanates from the presence of a great horror, has permeated through the house. Usual forms are ignored, and the room is entered, and exclamations of amazement and grief fill the air. Rizpah makes no resistance. She only opposes the vio- lence of her captors by warning them to handle the dag- ger they had taken from her carefully, and not to use so much unnecessary force, as she had no wish to escape.     366,         ATHALIAH. Various versions of the tragic occurrence circulate rapidly  through Jerusalem. Athaliah was well known; but who is this strange woman that committed the horrible deed? is the question on every lip. In one household the intelligence A excited the most painful but diversified interest, the house of Adin, in which were, besides the usual faaily, Benoni and Benaiah; and Zillah, though living witw Rebekah, might still be counted one of them.                In Benaiah it excited a just indignation, which made him I for the moment overlook what would be the probable results . of a searching enquiry in the past life of Rizpah. He deemed Athaliah as virtuous and noble in sentiment as she was  I beautiful in person.                   i Miriam had other views of the character of Athaliah, still she shuddered at the dark fate that had overtaken her, and thought it undeserved. Zillah, horror-stricken, as were all, mingled with her feel- ings fervent praise to God that the dreadful murderess was  not her mother, and that she had been preserved from utter ruin in being subject to such a wretch.          : Benoni, unlike them all, connected Rebekah with this affair, and began to discern, through the dark clouds that I still enveloped it, gleams of light that showed her innocent I of the crime he had imputed to her. But the time for surmise was short. The public feeling demanded instant punishment for the guilty; and hardly  I had the murder been half discussed, when the announce- ment was made that the trial before the elders of the city would take place the next day. A preliminary examination j of Caleb, the one best qualified to give an account of the internal management of Athaliah's household since its first, organization, elicited but little information. Rizpah had I never been a servant of his late mistress, much less her friend. He believed that Rizpah had sometimes prescribed for her when she had been sick, for the Arab had great skill in medicine. It had never occurred to him that there had been anything mysterious in their intercourse. In a word, the simple faith of the afflicted old servitor could see noth- ing in his beloved mistress but what was good and noble. In recounting her virtues he was voluble as his sobs would allow him to be; but when the question was of matters that might militate against the high standard of her he had set   A REVELATION.        367 up in his heart, he either could not be made to understand their drift, or else gave decided negatives to them. The chamber in which the court was to be held, situated by the Prison Gate of the city, was crowded to its utmost capacity. No doubt existed as to the guilt of the accused, and none questioned what would be her doom. But the interest to hear the details of the crime, and to watch the tracing out of the hidden and devious -ways that had led to its commission, was intense. It was this curiosity that had given to the trial a prominence and importance it would not otherwise have possessed. Benoni and Benaiah had each determined to be present at the trial, feeling that however painful the disclosures might prove to them, they were better met at the very out- set, where refutation might be possible. But when they reached the trial-chamber, ingress was out of the question; Benoni, however, managed to have conveyed to one of the elders, intimation that the accused was at one time a ser- vant in his house, and that he might thus be able to throw some light on the matter. He was in consequence admitted, with Benaiah, at a door used only for the entrance of those immediately connected with the trial. To the searching, eager gaze directed towards her from all eyes, Rizpah replied by one as cool and unabashed as if she had been simply a mere spectator of the scene, instead of being its great central feature. As the elders who were to be her-judges entered the room, the busy hum of voices that had been questioning without receiving satisfactory answers, ceased, and all awaited the coming developments with hushed expectancy. "Woman, what is thy name and nation?" enquired the elder who had been deputed by his associates to conduct the investigation. "My name is Rizpah, and I am an Arabian," was the prompt reply. "Thou art accused of a crime of such magnitude that it is hard to conceive of any one committing it without strong provocation, which it is not likely thou couldst have had. last thou any one to testify for thee, for, guilty and hardened as thou hast shown thyself to be, yet thou shalt have justice." c"None! nor do I desire any! I am able to speak for my- self!"     368         ATHALIAH. Caleb was called as the first witness. Rizpah interrupted  the first question put to him by addressing her judge with ironical reverence. "My lord Israelite, thou mayest spare thy valuable time. No need to prove an act which I acknowledge, and of which I have no reason to be ashamed." A murmur of indignation commenced swelling through the apartment, which ceased when the judge with some vehe- mence exclaimed: "c Woman of a vile race! Hast thy reason fled that thou darest thus, not only to avow, but also to glory in a crime that could have only been perpetrated by one of thy blood- thirsty race?" "Not so fast, my lord," was the taunting reply. "As for my race, it is nobler than thine; for while we both have Abra- ham for our father, my nation sprang from the young and beautiful Hagar, daughter of a people that once held thy ancestors as slaves, while thy ancestress was the decrepit Sarah. And, as for fear, I do not know the word. I am here by my own will. I had means of escape, but I did not choose to use them." Provoking as were these words, there was a cool hardi- hood about the speaker that made her hearers more anxious to know her history and her motives than to avenge the in- sult offered to their national pride. There was a brief pause, and then Rizpah continued in the same cold, mocking tones. "Blood-thirsty, thou calledst my race; and yet thou may- est search my country, and find no city of refuge for the man-slayer to flee to, for no necessity exists for them. Canst thou say as much?" "Thy mouth is as full of lying vanities as thy hands are  red with blood! Art willing to tell what motive actuated thee, before thou diest the death? Thou hast cruelly slain a noble and honored daughter of Israel-one that could never have done thee an injury-what then was thy object? Wert thou only the hired murderess, and is there some one yet more guilty than thyself?" "Thou art right! Athaliah never did me an injury, and yet I killed her, and would do so had she a score of lives!" "Away with her! let her die the death!" exctedly ex-   A REVELATION.        369 claimed the judge, without turning to his colleagues for their sanction. "Stay!" cried Rizpah, with serious energy. "I fear neither death, nor the manner of my death; but as I had an object in doing away with Athaliah, so I have an object in submitting to this trial. For see!" and Rizpah with a rapid movement took from the folds of her dress a small box, which she held with arm extended, causing it at the same time to fly open, "in this box is a poison so deadly, that simply touching it with my tongue would place me beyond the power of your rage. But I scorn to die thus. Do your worst, but first grant me a patient hearing." As she ceased speaking, she flung the box from her. Its contents, being in the form of thick paste, remained in it. "Thou shalt have it!" replied one of the elders who had hitherto taken no part in the examination. "But add not to thy sins by speaking of aught that is untruthful." There was a gentle dignity in the speaker that seemed to attract the attention of Rizpah. Soon the glance she cast towards him changed to a fixed look, and she eagerly scan- ned his features as if striving to find an answer to some questioning doubts that were arising in her mind.' At length the clue she had been seeking presented itself. With gentleness in strange contrast with her conduct she said: "Thou art Eleizer. Thy features are strangely altered, but I recollect thy voice though I only heard it once. Thou shalt be my witness that which I utter is the truth." It needed not this to intensify the interest all felt to hear this woman's story. Her recognition of one of her judges, and her claiming him as a witness to the truth of what she was about to say, caused every eye to rest upon the aged and worthy Eleizer. He bore the scrutiny with calmness. "I never saw thee before, as far as my memory serves me, and how then can I vouch for the truth of thy story?" "Thou wert present at the trial of my mother," replied Rizpah, in subdued tones; 'nay, thou wert one of her judges, and the only one bold enough to plead that mercy be shown her. Thy words have never been forgotten by me." "That must have been long since," responded Eleizer, in low tones, yet clearly heard by all, so hushed to perfect stillness was the apartment. 16*     370         ATHALIAH.  "Thirty-six years ago that brutal murder was com- mitted!" replied Rizpah, with heightened voice. . "Of what was thy mother accused?" enquired Eleizer, unable as yet to recall the circumstances to which Rizpah  alluded.  "1hey called it witchcraft," exclaimed Rizpah, with in- creased vehemence. "Satan never hatched a fouler lie than that, nor was ever guilty of so black hypocrisy as was one of my mother's judges!" "And what was his name?" asked Shaltiel, the elder who  had just questioned her. "Shallum! Thrice cursed be his memory, and may his grave be dishonored!" "He was slain soon after the trial by a young Arab who refused to give his name, but was supposed to be related to the condemned woman," said Eleizer, the whole occurrence  now vividly brought to his mind. "He was her son, my brother," fiercely responded Riz- pah, "and his vengeance did not stop there." "Miserable wretch!" exclaimed Shaltiel; " dost glory in the triple murder thy infamous brother committed? For when he slew the father he slew both his sons!" "Ay, that I do; and glory that I, too, have taken ven- geance." "And was this thy motive," enquired Eleizer, " for mur- dering Athaliah? Oh! wretched woman! To pursue thy victims to the third generation for what, at the most, was only mistaken judgment in the sire!" "Mistaken judgment!" retorted Rizpah in bitter tones and jeering laugh, that thrilled her hearers. "Say, rather for the foulest sin that ever defiled humanity!" "This must go no further," interrupted the third elder, who had so far contented himself with merely watching the proceedings, " this woman has committed an infamous crime and deserves to die the death. If she has ought to say, let her say it, and leave off at once accusations which may be utterly groundless." "Thou hast justly spoken," replied Rizpah with calmness; "I have much to say, and I swear by the grave of my mother-I know no greater oath-to tell the simple truth." "Thirty-six years ago-I was then sixteen years of age-I was a happy and guileless maiden. I had no riches, no fine FSN   A REVELATION.        371 habiliments, no luxurious food, no rank in life, and yet I was happy, for I had more than all these combined-a mother who by the magic of her love could make the desert seem a garden, a crust of bread a sumptuous feast. My father died when I and my brother were yet young, and we were thus entirely dependent upon our surviving parent. How well she fulfilled her arduous labor, let the bright, happy life of her children testify. It was not that we al- ways had a plenty of the things that sustain life, and make it desirable, for the contrary was often the case, but that our mother, from the deep ocean of her love, found resources that others could never have produced. Was the way long and toilsome? She would beguile it by cheerful talk, and by the example of an unselfish spirit that was always for- getful of her own toil, and full of strength and courage for others. At our nightly bivouac-for our necessities caused us to lead a wandering life-if our food lacked either in sufficiency or quality, she would make us forget hunger, or impart a new relish to the coarse fare, by relating some charming story, woven at will from the meshes of her busy brain. Constant companionship with such a mother lent idolatry to love. Whatever might have been the natural bent of my disposition, it was plastic beneath that mother's gentle touch. Oh! my mother! my mother!" Rizpah's tones and manner had gradually been softening and this touching apostrophe seemed to flow so naturally from the heart, that hardly one imagined it might have been done for effect. But the emotion was genuine. Dark as was her heart, in its depths gleamed this bright jewel! After a brief pause, Rizpah resumed: "My mother was beautiful, not with the soft beauty that must ever be shielded from the sun, but of that kind born of the sun, rich and healthy in hue. Every motionTof her lithe form was unfettered grace. But it was not simply beauty of form or feature that won her way to all hearts, but her goodness of heart. Poor as she was herself, she never failed in finding ways of succoring others as poor, or poorer. Her skill in combating disease was something wonderful. She was not infrequently called upon to minis- ter even to the wealthy, but the bulk of her labors in this direction lay among the destitute, and then thanks was all the fee she ever received.     372         ATHALIAI. "One black day the lustful eyes of Shallum fell on her. The inherent purity of her soul could not be discerned by the gross senses of this old ravenous wretch. He made pro- posals to her, which, as soon as she could fully learn their drift, for such advances, even in her long wandering life, were almost unknown to her, she repelled with scorn. Baffled in his desires, and maddened by the contemptuous refusal of what he deemed magnificent offers, he resolved upon her destruc- tion.  "Conscious of the utter hypocrisy of his motives, and fear- ing that others might catch a glimpse of them, he craftily sought to draw Naaman into the unequal and unholy strife against my poor mother. He succeeded, and the coalition of lust and bigotry was complete. Witchcraft was the miserable pretence on which the arrest was made. Her cures were laid to the agency of evil, instead of being ac- knowledged as the simple results of healing herbs applied by a judgment carefully exercised, and a compassion and love that ministered alike to body and spirit. An artless saying of my brother, when a child, and asked if he was ever hungry: 'Oh! no; for when there is no bread, I eat one of  mother's stories,' was brought up as evidence that she even supported her children by unnatural and evils means. Naa- man, blind in his bigotry, which he counted zeal for his re- ligion, believed everything of evil that the malice of the baffled Shallum caused to be testified against my mother. Against these unjust judges Eleizer ventured to plead some- thing in behalf of the innocent woman standing meekly be- fore them, but he was the younger of the three, and his words were of no avail. This miserable mockery of justice over, she was deemed guilty and sentenced to die the death, and Shallum had the unblushing effrontery and more than Satanic malice to throw the first stone at her! His life soon paid the penalty of his hypocrisy; but what was that, wasted by years and guilty excess, or the lives of his sons, compared to my brother's, so fresh and vigorous in its very spring-time! "Thus far the excess of injury was against me, and I de- termined, when awakening from the temporary stupor into which these events had cast me, that the balance should be changed. I was entirely alone-of both mother and brother cruelly bereft. All of love that had hitherto found lodge-   A REVELATION.        373 ment in my heart fled from it, and I henceforth devoted my life to deeds of hate and violence against the murderers of my mother. In changing so completely my whole nature, I put from me even my name, and took that of Rizpah. I adopted the profession of a soothsayer, and for a few years made Mizraim* my place of sojourn, the fittest place to learn the mummeries and deceits of the art I intended to make the means of livelihood, and make it perhaps subserve directly the purposes I had in view. "Here, without seeking, I met the family of Naaman -" The impatience. of the populace without, which had hitherto confined itself to words, which had found their way only as murmurs to the Trial Chamber, now culminated in deeds. An effort was made to force the door, which was partially successful. But the room was already too full to admit further ingress. Through the half-open entrance came fierce cries calling for vengeance. Rizpah's voice was completely lost 'in the rushing waves of tumultuous sound that now filled the room. Her cheek paled, not so much from fear, terrible as was the cry of the multitude for its victim, but from apprehen- sion that she would not have an opportunity of finishing her recital, and thus expose the past life of Rebekah. The soldiers forming the guard at length succeeded, partly by force but more by persuasion, in closing the door; but the howlings of the tempest without were more dis- tinctly heard, and it was very evident that another assault would prove successful, and might prove dangerous to the occupants, of the over-crowded room, unless Rizpah was speedily given up. The judges, therefore, determined that the trial should terminate at once, but at Benoni's earnest solicitation he was permitted to put a few questions to the accused. "Rizpah, thou recollectest me! I am Benoni, at whose house thou camest the night of the hurricane that unroofed my dwelling. Thou wert my daughter-in-law's hand-maid when each of her husbands died. The last evidently per- ished by foul means. I conjure thee tell me if thou wert the murderess?" There was a pause of a moment, during which the sounds * Egypt.     374          ATHALIAH. from the outside of the building swelled up threaten- ingly. Benoni, with a spirit and energy little expected from his age, exclaimed: "Woman, for thy oath's sake, I conjure thee answer me, and speedily."  "Both thy sons died by my hands!" slowly and emphati- cally replied Rizpah; and then, as if to answer the looks of enquiring horror cast on her, she proceeded: "The elder, Elnathan, was not loved by Rebekah. I tempted her by hinting that if he were removed she could claim his brother Heber. Though willing, as she afterwards proved herself, to reap the fruits, she was too weak to plant the seed. I did it for her. As for Hezron, he was in my way. Rebekah ! had a son by Elnathan!" (the tumult from without was in- creasing so rapidly that Rizpah had now to raise her voice almost to a scream) " and she therefore had no claim to Heber. This son is living-he is here--" The door again flew open, and a scene of indescribable con- fusion ensued. Intelligence of the two fresh murders she  s had acknowledged had gained circulation without, and the fury of the populace had suddenly become uncontrollable. Those within, to save themselves, pushed forward the object of the common vehemence and rage. Tossed hither and thither but always onward, Rizpah floated out as a waif on the troublous waters to the whirlpool of destruction be- yond. All the formalities of stoning to death were dis- pensed with. She was buffeted, trampled on, torn, till not merely life, but every vestige of humanity was extinct. And then the storm subsided. A reaction came, and many stole away, when they saw, after all, how insignificant the ob- ject of all this turmoil was -as it lay there a mangled mass, inanimate and revolting to the sight. Soon through the throng surrounding it pressed a man, who steadily ap- proached towards it. The crowd gazed silently at him, as if curious to see what new indignity he proposed offering. He stooped down, and though his lip quivered, his eyes were not averted. He lifted in his arms the object which, but a few minutes previous, had. been the living, acting Rizpah and turned to convey it away. When the people standing near saw that it was kindness, not enmity, that actuated him, a murmur arose that indicated a forcible resistance.   THE SETTING OF THE SUN.      375 Some of them then recognized him as Akyar, the phy- sician. '"What would ye?" he enquired in firm tones. ' I ex- cuse her not for her crimes. For them she has paid the for- feit of her life. But she is my countrywoman, and sinful as her life has been, I would not that she should become the food of vultures. Let me bury her in peace." The physician was allowed to pass on unmolested--a no small sign of the esteem in which he was held by the com- mon people. At this juncture Benoni and Benaiah emerged from the building in which the-trial had been held. The sun was shining brightly. The old man glanced upwards at the sky, and, inhaling a long breath of the pure air, whis- pered to his younger companion: " let us thank God, my son, that thy poor mother is wholly innocent of the crime of which I deemed her guilty. She shall now be the object of our tenderest care. My declining years will yet be happy, and I shall die in peace." CHAPTER THE LAST. THE SETTING OF THE SUN. Two years after the occurrences related in the last chapter, and near the close of a summer's day, Adin and his brother Helem were pursuing their way up the most westerly of the mountain ranges of Naphtali. They had abandoned to the care of their attendant the mules they had hitherto ridden, and were proceeding on foot from choice. Helem was the first to tire of this change, but as he had been the one to propose it, he only found fault in an indirect way. "I wish that good sister, Miriam, of ours, was a little less fond of hiding away in these mountains!" "Or thou less fond of pursuing her hither; for, though she has only been absent from Jerusalem two little moons, thou hast given me no peace till I consented to accompany thee 1 " laughingly interrupted Adin. "Well, Adin, confess that I am not singular in my desires or movements, for we are only the rear-guard of quite a re-     376          ATHALIAII. spectable train that has preceded us. First, Miriam ex- presses a wish to spend the summer in the place where the childhood of her husband was passed. Zillah, its possessor, goes to become her hostess. Rebekah, of course, goes with Zillah. Benoni follows Benaiah. Caleb, the old servant of the ill-fated Athaliah, touchingly clings to the crazed Re- :bekah, and- is allowed to become one of her household. And finally we, disregarding the toils and perils of these distress- ing hills, follow--" "Speaking for thyself, Helem I Is it really Miriam or Zillah?" interrupted Adin, gayly. "Speaking for myself, then, and once for all," seriously responded Helem; "I follow Miriam. Zillah is beautiful, and, more than that, is thoroughly good; and her devotion to Rebekah, who thinks she is her hand-maid, and treats her as such, is above all praise. But there is something about Zillah, kind and gentle as she is, that repels a love that would be content with nothing less than her whole heart. I admire her-yes, and love her; but only as I am willing that you and every true and worthy son of Israel should love her." "There certainly is something wonderful, Helem, about Zillah's devotion to Rebekah. Her sudden elevation to rank and wealth, one would naturally suppose would have made her more proud, or at least have made her anxious to enjoy to their full extent the pleasures from which she had so long been debarred." "But not more wonderful than her escaping the pollution of that wretch, Rizpah, who reared her."          i An elevation more than ordinarily steep, left the brothers little breath for conversation. Helem, on reaching its sum- mit, panted out: "Well, this is worse than a day's march." But the scene that now lay spread before them well re- paid the efforts they had made. They had shortened the way by coming on foot, and they now unexpectedly found   : themselves in sight of what was now Zillah's dwelling. On their left lay the plain of Esdraelon, reaching westerly to X the shores of the Great Sea, whose waters were suffused with the crimson glories of the setting sun. Far away to their right rose the lofty peaks of Lebanon, while between these extremes of plain and mountain could be seen every diversified   THE SETTING OF THE SUN,      3" beauty of richest verdure, whether of vine or fruit, tree or flower, the whole scene veined with the silvery element that imparts to nature its rosy hues of healthful life and activity. There was also what lends greatest charm to the beauties of the landscape, the presence of those we love. On the lawn immediately before them, seated on a rustic bench, were Miriam and Benaiah, and near them stood Benoni; while advancing from the house were Zillah and Rebekah, followed by the bent form of Caleb. Then came cordial and affection- ate greetings and conversation, kept up with a spirit that ignored the ordinary forms of courtesy and hospitality. Shadows had fallen on the beautiful landscape, and were stealthily stealing up the mountain side, yet no one thought of leaving the softly-wooing air for the more luxurious appointments of the dwelling near by, but not after all so in- viting as the scene that lured them to tarry where they were. There was a strange diversity in the separate features of that otherwise harmonious group, just as there were differ- ent lights and shadows falling upon them. On the face of one lay the faint flush of the light of the dying day, while the shimmering of the full-orbed moon, momently growing in strength and beauty, rested on her head. This was Zil- lah. She had buried her love in the grave of Ethni, but in her soul was gradually strengthening the peaceful light that would surely culminate in the undying glories of heaven. One was in deep shadow, rock and tree combining to ward off both the waning and the waxing light. This was Caleb, watching with listless eye Rebekah, whose gentle insanity he linked with the dreadful event that was ever in his thoughts-the murder of his beloved mistress, Athaliah, and which shrouded his house of life in darkness. Over Rebekah's form flitted patches of light and shadow as the gentle breeze swayed the overhanging foliage beneath which she stood. Spectral was this mingling of light and motion, but not more so than was the woman over whose form it quivered, vanished, and returned again. How un- real! how unlike the Rebekah of old, this meek, uncomplain- ing, yet far from happy woman! To her mind the substances of life appear as shadows. The living son she called Ethni was not more real to her than the memory of one loved and gone is to an unshattered mind. She changed times and     378         ATHALIA.  seasons, sometimes living in the space of one brief hour as child and maiden and matron. Away from shadows, flitting or fixed, out in the full light of the moon which is pouring down its pearly splendors, is a group that speaks only of happiness. Its central feature, Benaiah and Miriam-one in heart and mind and soul, for their beings have been fused in the furnace of a great afflic- tion, and have come forth purified and for ever united. Behind them, with his hands resting lovingly on their heads, rises the erect form of Bp3mQni, wearing-the crown of honora- ble gray hairs, which-flings back the white light of the moon, as if it needed not its added glory. An infant's cry from the house, soon pacified, however, by the fostering care of Rachel, his gratified attendant, proclaims that the : eyes of the old man have been blest by seeing his children's  children to the third generation. Adin and Helem stand on either side. Husband, father, brother, child! A nobly endured past-a joyous present gliding into: an assured fu- ture-for let it be what it will, they know God's smile will rest upon and gladden it. Oh! happy hearts! Oh! bright and glorious summer of Heaven-blessed life!  A rustling sound as of a rapid footstep, and Rebekah ap- proaches. aEthni! Didst hear that cry? They told me he was dead. He is not! He is not! I shall see him after all!"  She hastened towards the house, followed by the ever vigilant Zillah, who has heard her words. "Darling, will this cloud never be lifted from my poor mother's mind?" said Benaiah in low tones to his wife. As he spake, a cloud obscured the moon, and the land- scape stretched out before them lay in shadow. A silence of a -few moments intervened, and then Miriam, laying her hand upon her husband's arm, said: Yes! look yonder!" He followed with his eyes the direction of her outstretched arm, and saw far above and beyond the lofty peaks of Leba- non piercing into heaven, while on their snowy crests the moon was pouring a flood of molten silver.
