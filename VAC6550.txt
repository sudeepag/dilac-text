THis work is respectfully dedicated to Senior Don Gar- cia y Tassara, second cousin to the author of the Arabian. Nights' Entertainments, Envoy Extraordinary and Minis- ter Plenipotentiary, to the Court at Washington, and to the Hon. Edlward L mbert, of the City of New York; and Col. William Knabe, of the city of Baltimore. To the first for his affinity and consanguinity to the great oriental author, and to the others, for their appreciation of the mar- vellous and as a pleasent antidote to ennui and divers other ills to which flesh is heir. Hoping gentlemen, that the work may prove interesting and instructive to you, and that it may cause you to laugh   a and grow fat-and, that you may-live for a thousand years -on, and on, till- ,C Like a clock, worn out with eating time, Tile waoela of wadry life, at last stands still." is the prayer of Tnu  AUTHOR.      ADVERTISEMENT. FROM the great success the author has met with in the present enterprise, he has been induced to issue not only a second edition, but to publish, during the present year, a second part, (each part to be complete within itself.) The work will prove a fair delineation of American character, and a faithfal portraiture of the physical aspect of the country. The object is not only to amuse, but to instruct; to create a spirit of tHope, Enlergy, and Self-reliance in the youth of the cou:ltry.  It will prove of interest to the scholar, tlhe politician, the man of business, the man of leisure, " a friend at the fire-side and a companion in the lonesome hour." Those who dwell in stately mansionq, who loll on silken sofas, who tread on velvet carpets, a1d "fariie sumptuously every day," will be amusefl and interested lat scenes and incidents of bonler life, whle the denizen of the farm-house and the-out-of the-wary place, will be equally amused at scenes and incidents in fashionable and polished city life. It is to be hoped a generous public will encourage  the en- terprise by responding at once -with orders for the forth- coming work. Subscribers and dealers will address Collins & Bro., No. 82, Warren St., N. Y., and the subscriber. 1 Vol. 12 mo., Muslin,  400 p. p., Price $1-10 copie  $8.-100 copies 870. DRAMATIS PERSON2E.

THE period at which this work opens was a happy, a glorious one for America. The nation was at peace with the world, and the eagle had long sought his eyry in the clouds. Her ships sailed triumphantly on every sea, and her star-spangled banner waved from the capital of every country. The surrounding nations sued her with more humility than ever despairing swain did faire ladye, for an asylum in her broad bosom-a resting-place under her over- shadowing wings. Thanksgivings and prayer went up from millions of honest hearts; for the people were as grateful as happy. The President, whether in public or private, hall or parlor, was ever with a light heart and an easy conscience, satisfied with himself-with the nation-the nation with him. The citizen was alike happy and pros- perous. It was a beautiful evening, late in the autumn of ---, at this golden period, that I was somewhat rudely, yet withal pleasantly, accosted, and interrupted in my 2      "   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  evening stroll down Capitol-hill, in Washington, by no less  a personage than my quaint friend, Governor Brown:-- "Hilloa, there, Colonel! what are you going to do with yourself to-night, eh?" "Don't know, Governor-go to bed, I guess." "Pshaw! Go with me to the White House, and see and  listen to the first cousin of the author of the Arabian 4 Nights' Entertainments, Sulciman Effendi, the Turkish i minister. They say he keeps up the old oriental custom of spinning yarns of an evening to while away the time,  instead of talking politics like us Americans, and that the  President, Cabinet, and the other ministers humor him,? and spin yarns also. To-night he spends a sociable even- ing with the President. Will you go?" "Will there be many ladies present?"  '"Yes; quite a number-all the elite of the city."  "Well, then, I'm at your service." Five minutes walk brought us to the President's mansion.  We were ushered into a magnificent and crowded suit of rooms. An interesting spectacle met our gaze. The glare  Bf gas lights, the glitter of uniforms, the blaze of jeweled ladies, the merry voices of the fairy beings assembled, was,  indeed, exciting. The grave statesman and the timid l: maiden, the Indian warrior, and the city belle, mingleL pleasantly together. We threaded our way to the head oh?  the principal apartments, and were introduced to his Excel- : 'lency, the President, and several of the cabinet and foreign ministers-conspicuous among the latter of whom was the  celebrated Sulciman Effendi.             4- After supper, in lieu of dancing, music, etceteras, the j company gathered around the minister, and demanded his : promised tale.                   ' "After his Excellency, the President," replied the g ambassador: "Courtesy demands that I should speak after iX L  '-L   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     15 our distinguished host. After your Excellency," continued I he, bowing to the President. "If there is no alternative, ladies and gentlemen," began the President, "I'll be compelled to entertain you with a short reminiscence, or lose the promised treat of our distinguished visitor. I will give you a reminiscence of the most interesting period of my life.  It may not interest you, but to me it is full of interest. It sealed my destiny. I am truly glad to lay aside, at any time, all r magisterial robes, politics, and the laborious duties of the day, to while away a few hours thus, in reviewing old memories, speaking of the past, our hopes, our fears, our- sorrows, our joys-ah! you smile General Houston, and look incredulous that one of my composition would give way to such reveries. Politician though I be, though I've been buffeted about, and my life been most pregnant with adventure and viscissitude--yet be assured the impressions of youth have not been entirely effaced-they are an oasis to me in rny public career, in my cares, responsibilities, and afflictions, to which I often turn when sickened with the deception, the depravity, and heartlessness of designing politicians, to that cool, refreshing enjoyment, for which I might sigh in vain were I to look for it elsewhere. Such fancies and indulgences in retrospect, by others, may be thought unbecoming  the dignity, the station--aye, the years, even, of one occupying the exalted position that I do; but, like Suleiman Effendi, I consider it wisdom. The whole aim and end of life is happiness. Some seek it in the pursuit of riches, some fame, some in the giddy circle, others at the shrine of Bacchus; but I, like my friend here, in retrospect. But, ladies and gentlemen, I'm tres- passing on your patience. I will now, without further preliminaries, 'spin my yarn,' and show you     16    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. How I came to be a Benedict. "Please sir, the stage-coach is waiting; please sir"- chimed in the waiter a second time, before he could finally arouse me, as I sat enjoying my cheroot before a cheerful fire in Brown's hotel, in the village of Morganton, North Carolina. "May it go to the ---! but tell the driver, servant, to tarry for me a moment," muttered I, as I arose, unwillingly enough, and busied myself in packing my little etceteras, previous to continuing my travels; for I had halted at Morganton, partly to enjoy the magnificent mountain scenery, and partly on account of the severity of the weather. The weather, though moderated to a degree, was still inclement. The March winds blew high and chilly, whistled around the wayfarer's head with biting unction, and moaned, and roared, and howled in sad cadences, in the lofty pines, and down the mountain gorges in the distance. But yet I had resolved to continue my jaunt on the evening in question; and having made my preparations, reckoned with the host, etc., at last answered the winding horn of the driver, by entering the coach. I found it already tenanted by three personages: one a beautiful young lady; the others, gentlemen. The lady was beautiful indeed! lovely as heart could wish. The gentlemen were both genteel looking men; the one about five and twenty-the other in the prime of life. The latter was evidently the father of the lady. "Smack! smack!" went the driver's whip, as we rolled over the frozen roads towards Lincolnton; and as the day advanced, more boisterous became the winds, and more biting the cold. Enveloping myself in my cloak, I sank back into one corner, to shiver with the cold, and muse over the charms   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   17   of the fair lady beside me; for it had already become dark, and I could no longer behold the bright, animating countenance. I had mused but a short time when I was aroused from my pleasing revery by some one hailing us from the road side, and begging the driver to halt. "Waup! waup! gently boys--still! stand!" and as the driver pulled up his prancing cattle, we all peered out in gloom and darkness, wondering who, or -what it could be, out on such a bitter, freezing night. Huddled by the side of the road stood a middle-aged woman and four thinly-clad children. "Will you be so kind, sir, as to give us passage in the coach to Lincoln- ton?" begged the half-frozen woman; " here is the fare, sir ;" and she handed a few pieces of silver to the driver. "Can't take you in, marm-already full-crowded-get out of the way." "Oh, me! oh, me! what shall I do? But I must go! My husband, gentlemen, has just returned from a two years' absence at sea, and is now lying in Lincolnton at the point of death. He sent for me to meet him there with my children, and I have walked four miles through the mountains, and have been waiting here in the cold and rain for three hours for the stage, until two of my little children are speechless; and then to be disappointed ;" and the poor woman burst into tears. "Pity! pity! oh, God, have mercy upon them!" ejac- ulated the beautiful maiden at my side: "but pa, we must take them in. Gentlemen, who will be so gallant as to vacate his seat for these poor creatures? See, those poor little things are freezing to death; remember God hath said, 'as ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto Inc.    "I spoke   would be happy to gratify you, Miss Alice," now up, for the first time, the young gentleman, whom 1 2*    18    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. afterwards learned was an importunate suitor of the lady's,?X *favored by the father, but scorned by the lady. Favored, : not for his virtues but for his fortune. "I would be I:: pleased to gratify you, Miss Alice, but would rather be I: excused from vacating a comfortable seat, and your pleas- ant society, to give place to these rude people, especially in these mountains, in- the middle of such a cold, bitter a night. Here, woman, tal;e this, and begone to some , neighboring farm-house, and travel at a more seasonable [- time;" and he threw her a handfull of silver. "There is no house in four miles, sir; the waters are : rising fast, and we would either drown or freeze on our way back. Take only my children, then, and I'll walk alone, myself; oh, do, for the sake of Heaven!" and with a piteous moan the poor woman bent forward and gazed imploringly-almost frantically--up into our faces. "By all that's sacred, I can't stand this: they shall have my seat, if I perish on the road," exclaimed I, open- ing the coach door, and springing out. "I Here, driver, :r lash my baggage to the top of the coach, and stow part of a these children in the boot. Hasten,- if you please, sir,- I and there is a dollar for your trouble." "Oh, sir! kind sir! God will reward you!" murmured i- the grateful woman, as she seated herself in the coach. * "Will you permit me, kind sir, to thank you also, for I your very generous and gentlemanly conduct," spoke the  young lady, as she extended to me her soft, delicate hand, and bestowing on me one of the sweetest smiles imagina- ble. "You have my respect and gratitude, sir. True nobility is hard to find, sir; hence I would be happy to know more of you-but the coach is starting, adieu! adieu!" and in a moment I was alone upon the road. , Twelve months from the events just related, I found j   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     19 myself strolling alone in Milford Park, New Orleans, striving vainly to overcome a depression of spirit, caused by intense heat, and my want of success in finding again  my fair stage-coach companion. With my eyes:-bent upon the ground, I strolled along in such perfect abandon that I scarce noticed the fine carriages that passed and repassed   me every moment, or the many gay parties around me, fV  and was awakened only from my stupor by the fluttering of a perfumed note, that fell at my feet as a splendid coach and four dashed past me. Picking it up, I was astonished on reading the following lines, hastily indicted with a pencil. c Mr. Martin Van Buren, will please call at 22, corner Bernard and St. James' streets; this evening, at 6 o'clock. 'few A-          A FRIEND." Not a little puzzled to know who it was that dropped me the note, for I was a perfect stranger in the city, I betook myself back to my rooms at the St. Charles to await the appointed hour. Who could it be?  Could it be Alice Smith, the long-sought-for stage-coach companion, the now cynosure of my heart?-Doubtful! for I had left no city unsearched. But the hour draws nigh. I will wait and see. It wants but forty minutes of the hour. How heavy  time flies! thirty minutes-twenty-five-ah! I can't wait longer! i "Hilloa, omnibus, drive me to 22, corner of Bernard and St. James' street." In five minutes I was set down in front of a princely mansion. I rang the bell, and was ;  ushered by a servant into a magnificently furnished cham- her, where I was requested to tarry a moment. Seating myself on a rich sofa, I ran my admiring eyes over the magnificent mirrors and paintings that decorated the tapes- tried walls, when I thought I recognized a familiar coun- tenance in a painting suspended over a mantle. Approach-       20   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.   21   ing it, I perceived, to my joy and astonishment, that it was the portrait of my long-sought-for Alice Smith ; and forgetting myself and my whereabouts in my exstacy, I sprang joyously forward, exclaiming aloud, "Alice! sweets Alice! and have I found you at last?" A merry peal of laughter rang out behind me, just as I was reaching out my arms to embrace the loved image: half-abashed, I turned round, and beheld standing in the middle of the floor, the fair original herself! But I was so overpowered I could utter no word of greeting. Neither could the lady; for, perceiving my exstacy before her portrait as she entered, she could do nought, in her modesty, but stand, and tremble, and blush scarlet. In a moment, however, I had gained my self-possession so far as to greet the fair lady, and lead her to a seat. And--and, ladies and gentlemen, befo  I arose from that sofa, I was an accepted suitor; anid but yonder sits the bride, and--his Excellency, as lie concluded, amidst the applause of the assembly, pointed to his amiable and honored wife. The Turkish ambassador was then called upon, who responded as follows: ' As I am a ' lone, lorn bachelor,' ladies and gentlemen, I cannot have the felicity of recounting to you my love adventures and other little etceteras incident thereto ; but, with your permission, will relate a little occurrence thalt befel me long ago, which I will take the liberty of naming and styling An Adventure at a Country Inn. Many years ago, on a brisk evening in November, Count Von Schwerin and myself halted at a country inn, not a thousand miles from far-famed Kalafat. Immediately onil our arrival, three bur]y-looking Scotchmen halted, as did   also a chaise-and-four, containing an elderly-looking gen- tleman and a beautiful young lady. After supper, the gentleman and lady, who I afterwards learned to be his daughter, retired to their room; and not wishing to familiarize ourselves with the suspicious-looking characters in the bar-room, the Count and myself also retired to a private apartment. The one was soon lost in the fumes of one of Herr Von Manteufel's best cigars, the other in the Koran. (There is but one God, and Mahomet is his Prophet!), Thus we sat until a late hour, when, in accordance with our invariable custom, we went out to see our horses, ere retiring to rest. As we neared the stables we perceived a light in one of them. We looked in, and saw the three Scotchmen before alluded to, interrogating a servant who was rubbing down the horses belonging to the chaise. We were about enter- ing, when we overheard the following conversation: "And you say, boy, your master's name is Yousouf Pasha, and that he is just returning from his gold-mines near Salonica, and that he has a large amount of gold with him." "Yes, yes; little black trunk most full-he! he! he!' ' Aye, aye, indeed!" The Count pulled me gently by the sleeve, and we stole back unseen. "The villians!" exclaimed- I, as we reached our room, "there will be robbery here, ah! and murder too, Count, if we don't prevent it." "I hope not; the inn is too full. They may follow them and attempt it to-morrow night; but we will forestall them, by putting the gentleman on his guard. So now let's to bed." The chimney-clock sounded eleven--twelve-one--ere I sank to sleep. I mused over the events of the day, tlhe    - 22   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        l conversation at the stable, the sunny face and melting eyes of the lady of the chaise. Now and then my mind would wander back to my quiet home, with its sunny groves and still sunnier faces. They were pleasing reminiscences. They brought rest to the weary soul-balm to the troubled heart. But nature must at last have her wonted rest; and true to nature, I sank into a deep sleep. 'I had not been asleep more than an hour when I felt a heavy hand upon my mouth, which greatly impeded my breathing. After making a weak, half-unconscious strug- gle, I awoke. "Silence!" whispered the Count in my ear; "I hear the robbers at the gentleman's door. I didn't expect the attack so soon." With light, stealthy steps we arose and armed ourselves cap-a-pie, and awaited, with (on my part) breathless anxiety, the fearful issue. But we had not long toiwait. In another moment we heard the door creak upon its hinges. They had effected an entrance. "Now!" whispered the Count, hoarsely, and, in a stride, we were at the door, and close on the heels of the robbers as they softly stole ir. We had scarcely gained our places, ere one of the ruffians drew aside the door of a dark lantern. In a second the room was flooded with light. In a far corner of the room reclined the beautiful daughter, in a profound slumber. The father was also sleeping no less soundly on a small sofa near the door at which we entered. We had scarcely thus scanned the room, when the rob- bers, who had at the same time taken the same glance, which was done as quick as thought, turned, and to their dismay espied us, as we stood fearful avengers, with hands full of weapons, coldly confronting them. With trembling and tottering knees they sank to the'   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     23 floor, like the veriest cowards, and in low voices prayed us to spare them. "We did not intend to harmr them," plead they; "we meant only to possess ourselves of a portion of their gold. We are poor, destitute beings, having large families to support, whom, if left now alone, would starve. Oh! spare us, then! Let us- depart; we will never make such attempts again!" The Count, after scowling on them a moment, turned an enquiring look on me. I bade him act as he pleased. Instantly beckoning them to follow, we all stole softly from the chamber to the outer door, leading to the stables, through which they had entered. Leading them one after another to the threshold, he bade them, merely with a kick, to begone. The ruffians waited not for a second bid- ding, but were soon out of sight.  Returning to the gentleman's room, we closed the door, and repaired noiselessly to our own chamber, and to bed; when, after chatting a half hour over the strange adven- tures of the night, sank again into the arms of Morpheus. When we awoke it was broad day, and the sun was far up in the heavens. "What a strange dream I've had," cried I, as I sprang out of bed. "Dream!-Ha! ha! ha! dream, the dickens. Look yonder, my boy," replied the Count, " and did you see those pistols and knives yonder, scattered pell-mell over the floor, in your dream, ell?" "Oh, aye, I recollect now.  The adventure was so unusual and strange, that I thought it merely a dream ;" and chatting thus, we dressed and descended to the break- fast room. Seated at the table was the gentleman, his I daughter, the host, and hostess, doing ample justice to the  viands that loaded the table, and in animated conversation.   24    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        "Yes, pa," continued the lady, as we approached them, i: "I dreamt the same dream that you did yourself. I dreamt , the assassins had each a long, long knife in their hands, j and that their eyes were like coals of fire; so dazzling that they hurt my eyes; and that two kind angels interposed,  held up flaming swords, at the sight of which the robbers  sank down and swooned away. Oh, one of the dear angels was so beautiful, so--but yonder!" and with an exclama- X tion of surprise, she pointed at us, as we entered and seated ourselves at the table.  "The same! the same! how strange!" replied the   -  father; "but I beg pardon," continued he, addressing us, 1 "I beg pardon. We were just speaking of a similarity of dreams myself and daughter had last night, in which our imaginings were alike, and you, gentlemen, were the heroes. But I can account for that from the fact of seeing you yesterday at the supper-table."          ; The Count turned to me, and with a smile of satisfaction  cried, "And ye'll admit now, Effendi, that my theory is  correct (adverting to a former discussion we had had about  dreams, spirit-rappings, etc.) I scarcely ever advance an  idea bordering on the marvelous, without the wherewithal 1 to sustain it. Absurdities, to the minds of youth, are gross evil. The mind is soft and pliable, ready for any impres- sion; and, believe me, an impression made then is indelli-) ble. Many a strong, vigorous, healthful mind has been destroyed by vulgar, marvelous theories, ghost stories, and  the like; still, still, I have been staggered by strange pre- ! sentiments :-but I beg pardon, ladies and gentlemen; and with your leave myself and companion will join in your  repast, and at the same time, with your permission, I will  interpret, or, rather explain, your wondrous dreams."  Whereupon he related the adventures of the night, elicit- j ing from his auditory, and especially the fair lady, much  ,I    A-1 aT  At A.  A H - L - A. w  surprise, and from the host, consternation, who, springing from the table, ran and-searched the house in vain for his thievish customers, with invectives and threats, which, if executed upon the poor wretches, would leave them in a sad plight indeed. Most grateful was Yousouf Pasha, and no less his lovely daughter, for the timely service rendered them, assuring us that their gratitude was as profound as their surprise was great, at the strange occurrence, and the similarity of their dreams. We were soon on terms of intimacy; and, as we sat, the one lost in the fumes of the savory meats, the other cowering under the melting eyes of the maiden, Yousouf Pasha related to us a dream, equally as marvelous, and which not only sealed his destiny, but confirmed him in their belief. Yousouf Pasha's Story. I was sitting one evening in my little office in East Bosna Serai, musing sadly enough over my poor fortunes; for I had been a physician now six months without having a single case, although there was a vast deal of sickness in the city. My stock of cash was almost exhausted; and when that was gone, how would I live? Not by my pro- fession, surely. Many less able and deserving physicians were making fortunes and living in affluence, while I, a poor, unknown physician, immediately in their midst, was starving-ah! starving-for bread and employment. Oh! how gladly would I have obeyed a summons! How ten- derly I would have nursed a patient! But no patient ;-- no call. And musing thus sadly, as I reclined upon my scanty couch, I finally sank into a deep sleep. I dreamed that the city was deluged. I could hear the fearful surges of the waters, the hissing, the roaring of the winds, the crashing of the houses coming in contact with 3 !   26   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   27   each other, and the shrieks and groans of the dying. Finally I awoke, ran to the door, and looked out; but all was calm and serene. The bustle, the noise, and confusion of the city had subsided down to the stillness of death, save only the call of the watchman. Returning to my couch I lay down ; and in a moment's time I was again in the land of dreams. This time I thought I heard a loud knocking at the door. I dreamed that I opened it, and a beautiful damsel stood before me. She held in one hand a purse of gold, and with the other pointed down a dark, narrow alley, that ran past the rear of my shop. Beautiful, did I say she was? Ah! she was as lovely as an houri, and as fair as-the evening air imbedded in the lustre of a thousand stars. "Go!" she exclaimed, c'go!" still pointing down the alley. I lingered, gazing enraptured on the fair being, unable to move. "Go!" she again cried, most vehemently, holding up, at the same time, not the glittering purse, but a long white shroud in one hand, in the other a scroll, upon which I saw engraved the single word "Poverty." I started with a loud exclamation, and awoke. I rubbed my eyes and gazed around, and saw it was only a dream. Again I laid me down, but not to sleep. I could see the phantom, the angel, or fairy, or whatever it was, still point- ing down the alley. Again I tried to court slumber; but in Vain. The single word "Go" was ringing constantly in my ears like a knell. I could not sleep; so I arose, wrapped my cloak around me, drew my cap over my face, and started out, to dissipate, if possible, the phantoms of my dream. I had traversed the alley about a quarter of a mile uninterrupted, when, all of a sudden, I heard a deep groan at my side. Peering down through the darkness, I beheld a man lying a few feet from me. I struck a light,   and flashed it across his face. It was the mayor of the city. He was almost crimson with blood. A deep gash marked his cheek, from which the blood flowed in streams. He was almost exhausted, and I bent down to catch a word of explanation. "Quick!'; he murmured, faintly; "save me, or I will die of exhaustion. I have just been beset by a gang of thieves, who left me here for dead." Being at a distance from the watch or other help, I picked him up in my arms, and half carried, half dragged 'l'him to my shop. I immediately washed and dressed his wounds, which I found dangerous, but not mortal. By the evening of next day the news flew over the city like wild-fire, not only of the robbery and attempted assas- sination, but of my strange dream, and skillful treatment of the patient. From that day my fortune was made. I could not attend to half the calls made me, and gold poured in in abundance. You will not blame me, then, gentlemen, for believing in spirit-rappings, dreams, visions, and second- sight." "You have goodly cause, truly," replied I. That I have, my friend, and pleasing withal. Every day I am led to rejoice that I was so blessed as to be vis- ited by such a fair phantom, and selected as the instrument, under God, to resuscitate and restore the almost lifeless man; thereby reaping so rich a reward, not only so far as honors and emoluments are concerned, and the conscious- ness of having done a good deed, but in becoming acquainted with, and securing, as an help-meet, the accomplished daughter of the mayor." "Well, gentlemen," observed the Count, "we are all curious creatures at best.

' But, ladies and gentlemen, you are doubtless wearied with the disquisition; and as my companion and myself have finished our repast, we will even reckon with the host and  resume our jaunt."  In a few moments we were safely ensconsed on our steeds; and as we turned to leave the inn, many smiles, blessings, and kind adieus from the gentleman and his amiable   ddaughter were wafted to us till we were far out of sight of  the goodly tenement and inmates of the "Country Inn." At the conclusion of our story, a buzzing applause, intermingled with invitations and promises to return the following night, ranlthrough the circle; and in a moment  the room was deserted. ,   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     29 XF-j C O I 1 ID I' GJ T.      SECOND N-IGHT. THE FAIR ADVOCATE. THE company having assembled according to appoint- ment, were entertained by the Hon. William H. Hooper, as follows: "Arrah! and can't ye go along? Is it stopping ye'd be afther, here on the highway, till ten o'clock at night? Ge-up! ge-up!" cried the lusty driver to his frightened horses, as we were traveling alone towards Salisbury, North Carolina, on a dark, stormy night in January. The night  was exceedingly dark--dark even to blackness; the winds came and went in fitful gusts, and the rain poured down in torrents. But I heeded not the  inclemency of the weather.  I was anxious to reach home; for I had been i absent many years. He, alone, who; has been absent for a long time from those he held in the most grateful remem- brance, from his dear, dear home, can appreciate my feel- ings; feelings of intense gla'dness, of alternate hope and fear: for I had now almost reached the goal to which I had for long years looked forward with so many and pleasing anticipations. The joyful faces, the sunny countenances, and cordial welcome of my  affectionate" parents and fond relations; these were I receiving and enjoying in prospec- tive, when I was somewhat suddenly aroused by the voice of the driver.  "An' it's forrad I want yese to go, and not stand starin' an' trimblin' like fools as ye are! Troth, 3*     '30   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMNT9.       X now, an' I'll see what ye're frightened at! but whist!  whist! an' is it divils I hear, sir?"          "Oh, heavens and earth!" -shrieked a deep, guttural : voice, just before us, "I see his red, flashing eyes, I feel his cold, slimy hands as they grip me, and his hot, foetid breath on my face. Oh! it seethes, it burns! take him away! take him away! Save me, oh, save me! Bettie,   will you not come to my rescue? You're an angel, you are pure, you are bright! All Hell cannot prevail against " you!  Oh! I knew you'd come! I knew you'd come!"   : Just then the rays of the carriage lantern dimly lighted up  the scene before us, and we beheld a man lying stretched in the road, from whom the delirious ravings -issued.  "Poor Vance! poor Vance!" exclaimed the honest  Irishman, as we lifted the drunken man from the mud and ^ placed him in the coach, " an' it's mesilf that's sorry to see him come to this. A finer or more talented young man niver lived!" "What! surely this is not my old play-mate, Vance'!:; Surely, Patrick, you're mistaken. When I left home he : was one of the most promising young men in the country."  "Divil other than himsilf, sir: sorry to say it! For the  past year he has done nothing but drink, drink, 'till he is  intirely worn out wid the whisky and the 'liriumn tremens." "He raves about Bettie somebody.  Whom does he mean, Pat?'       -I "' Aye, an' ift's mesilf can tell yese. Ye see he wint to  R---, to the law school, two years ago, where he learnt, besides pleading at the bar, to indulge in potations an' liba- tions, as Billy Patterson was wont to say. He returned home; and instid of attindin' suits in coort, he paid suit to  Miss Bettie Garrett, whom report says he had a hankering afther many years; they say, too, she loved him, an' kinder smiled on his suit, even though she knew he drank    AME-RICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    31 a latle, until her friends advised her to turn him away; which she did, poor thing, to the sorra of her heart. But n arrah, thin, Vance, instid of refortnin', drank harder an' harder, till he's come to what he is. Oh, murther r mul- ther! what curious bastes we are!" Again we were on the road; and while the coachman scolded and whipped up his cattle, I sank back in one cor- ner of my seat, musing on the sad and deplorable condition of the unfortunate being stretched raving and writhing at my feet. H bethought me of the once high station he had i in society; his pleasing manners; his manly form; his towering intellect. I thought of the disgusting position i he was now in: then, again, I thought of reforming him; of making him, again, a star in society; a useful citizen.  "Is there no balm in Gilead, is there no physician there?" soliloquised I aloud to myself. "Ah! yes, there is, there i is," I exclaimed, as a thought flashed across my mind. "I -will be the physician; Miss Garrett the balm." "Who calls Bettie Garrett? You shan't have her, you shan't have her!" cried Vance, struggling to rise. With one foot on his body I held him down till we arrived at the City Hotel; where, having stowed him safely away, I hastily set out towards home, and was soon receiving those gratulations and embraces for which I had yearned so long. "Massa, here am a card for you," said a servant, enter- ing my apartment the next evening after my arrival. I glanced over it. It was an invitation to tea at Mrs. Gar- I rett's that evening. ' How fortunate!"I mentally ejao- ulated. At the appointed hour I presented myself at the mansion  of Mrs. Garrett. From a mere child, I found Miss Garrett had grown since my absence to be almost a full-blown rose.     82    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS. "Come sit down beside me," said I to her, as soon as I could extricate myself from the company. "La!"Mr. Hooper, you look as grave and serious as if you were going to deliver me a lecture. Pray court brevity, unless you would put me to sleep." "Bettie, they that turn unto righteousness shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever!" "La! me, a sermon as serno) '" and the happy girll clapped her hands with delight.  "Not a sermon, Bettie, but something that concerns you  very much, and another still more. I)o you recollect ourl  mutual friend, Vance?" At this question her cheek crim-  soned like the rose, and then the blood as quickly retreated  to her heart, leaving her face pale as marble, and causing her lips to quiver like a leaf shaken by the breeze.  i' What of him?" she hurriedly gasped. "You know what he once was, and what hle now is," I continued. "It remains with you to reform him. He loves you, Bettie, to madness. Nay, do not turn away.  You should give him some encouragement; you should-"  "What! would you have me marry an inebriate? would you have me sacrifice my-" "No, no, Bettie, not that. You should encourage him, and give him to understand you will be more condescend" ing and lenient some distant day, when he shall have reformed, become a sober man, and established for himself a character, and a name more worthy of you. You, alone, can reform him; snatch him from the gulf over which he stands, reinstate him in society, and save him from a drunkard's death, a drunkard's hell. The responsibility is great, is awful; the reward noble and glorious. Will you aid me?" 4' I will!" she exclaimed firmly.   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.     33  ' Thank God, Bettie!" and as I pressed her hand in mine, a bright tear-drop burst from her eye, and rolled down her cheek. Three days after the occurrences just related, Mr. Vance l made his disappearance from town; leaving, however, a note of explanation for me, thanking me for the interest I took in his welfare, assuring me he would follow my advice, Inerved and strengthened as he -was by the words of encour- agement gilCal. hlm by Miss Garrett, the evening previous. I go," said hle, "to win me a name, a fortune, a charac- ter: tell er farewh."  So hoe departed. One, two, three, four years passed away, and I found myself once more in company with Miss Garrett. From a lbashful girl of eighteen, she had ripened into a full flower, lovelier than ever; the star and acknowledged belle of every circle. The rich, the noble, the talented, sued for her I heart and hand ofttimes; but in vain. She was still loyal to her promise, though she nor I had heard of tance since i his departure. Precisely four years- had passed away, and Miss Garrett ; and myself met again 'for the first time in Washington City; for I had left home a short time after Vance's departure. We reached the city in the morning at the same time, and i mutually congratulated each other on being so fortunate as to arrive in time to witness the great combat about to take place in the Halls of Congress that day on "Southern heights." The city was alive with strangers, for great interest was manifested. We had just seated ourselves comfortably, when the Speaker rose, dropped his gavel, and silence ensued. On the instant, a tall, gaunt, rather distinguished-looking a representative, arose, just opposite the position I had occu- lpied with Miss Garrett, and addressed the House. For     34    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. an hour he spoke on the abolition of. slavery. He spoke in an able and masterly manner; was a cunning debator; and used every art to annihilate and demolish the poor Southrons. When he had concluded, amid the applause of his friends and adherents, he was followed by a noble-looking finely- formed young man. As he arose, methought, as I gazed  over that vast audience, that pity and sympathy beamed  from every countenance; for what could he do with the  masterly effort just made? At that moment Bettie con- vulsively grasped me by the arm, and whispered hurriedly, "Oh, God! it is he! it is he!" I looked round and dis- covered, to my astonishment, that it was the long-lost, ' long-absent Vance. His eye was riveted full upon Miss i Garrett, with a calm, smiling expression, as he opened his speech, which lie did rather awkwardly and hurriedly; but as he advanced he became more calm and collected. Anon, he warmed in the debate; his voice rose from the low, monotonous tone in which he began, to loud, clear, full X tones. The purest logic and the strongest arguments fell from his lips; and with the deep pathos of feeling, the might of Jove, le tore, uprooted, and rent assunder the position taken by his adversary. His countenance, before pale, was now radiant with light, and his voice at intervals rang through the hall like the clangor of a trumpet. The audience were held enchained for an hour and a half; and when he at last took his seat, sucll a burst of applause rang forth from that vast concourse as was never heard in the halls of legislation before. The House on the instant adjourned, and in the confusion consequent on retiring, I became separated for a moment from Miss Gar- X rett. On finding her again, she was leaning on the arm of  Vance. I made my way to him, and received a most hearty i greeting.   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERrTAINM ENTS.    35 One month after the occurrence just related, the follow-  ing announcement made its appearance in the "Washing- Union :" "HYMENEAL.---Married, in this city, on the 12th inst., by Rev. Jas. M. Gallagher, the Hon. Z. Vance, of N. C., to Miss Bettie Garrett, of Richmond, Va." When Mr. Hooper had concluded, the audience were entertained next by the Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, of Virginia, with ONLY A PRINTER. A Tale of Virginia Aristocracy. Sixteen years ago, Salem, in Virginia, was one of the most lovely villages imaginable; situated in the very heart of the great Valley of Virginia, yet commanding a mag- nificent view of the bold outlines of the Alleghanies and the Blue Ridge. The village contained no buildings of n6te save two : one of them a magnificent tenement, the princely residence of one of the "old Virginia aristoc- racy," and the other, the only inn, a small, quaint, yet pleasant house, nestled in the centre of the town. The proprietor of the one, a wealthy planter and distinguished officer of State; the other, a poor widow, whose only living depended on the profits of her table, which were but scant, as there was but little traveling done at that day through this retired village; and the advent of a stranger was always a subject of curiosity and in 'rest to the good townsfolks; as it always is in the out-oi 'ie-way places of America. To this little inn a gaily-dressed yet weary-worn traveler icked his way one evening in the autumn of 18-. The buxom hostess and her tidy daughter were all life, nd frisked about, bestirring the savory viands, delicious akes, and eggs, much--to the satisfaction of our hungry     36    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. traveler, who appeared to be a young man of some twenty summers, tall, commanding, of fine appearance and pleas- ^ ing manners. He soon, by dint of frankness, politeness, i and suavity of manners, insinuated himself into the good i ;: graces of the hostess and her daughter; with the latter of :: whom he appeared to be much struck, for she was  as lovely i as she was neat and graceful; "Possessing charms not  unlike, and equal to, one whom I adore," exclaimed the j young traveler, admiringly, as he placed himself before the :j sparkling fire, after finishing his repast, " and expect, ere long, to lea(. to the altar, and with whom you are doubtless X acquainted, as she lives only in the mansion above town, as 2 I understand."  "What! Emily Carrington?" enquired the hostess. "Even so, my good damne. I met her at the Springs! some months ago, became enamored of her, wooed her, and  amn now come to claim her as my own..  ' She is a beautiful girl, indeed!"' interposed Nannie.  the hostess' daughter, ' but somewhat proud, as is her : father."  "Not so, indeed, Miss Alvey. If she has pride, it is i nothing but native maidenly pride, which every lass should : have. And you say, Miss Alvey she is quite well.--Well," I will let this pleasing intelligence restrain me to-nightli and to-morrow I will give the fair enchantress, I trust, an agreeable surprise." Early next morning as etiquette would permit, the younllg man set out with buoyant heart and high hopes to the, the mansion. But we will precede him, and just look in. on his fair betrothed. In a magnificent parlor of the mansion sate Emily Car i rington and her mother; the one drumming a piano, the; other interrogating a servant.           : l   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     37 "' And you say, Sambo, he lodged last evening at the i inn?" ! "Yes, Missa; de cook say he dar now." g , ,Well, you can retire. And so, ma, it's even as I  expected. I thought it was him, as he rode past last evening." "Well, Emily, how do you intend to bluff him? I'm thinking it will be both a shameful and delicate business." "Shameful, indeed! When Attorney Floyd introdnuced him to me at the Springs, he brought him forward as one of his law-students, and not as a poor printer, as he is. I'll never forgive Governor Floyd!" "He is not to blame, my dear. He is his pupil. Didn't the letter say he was a journeyman printer at A--, but, in consideration of his promising abilities, Governor Floyd undertook, gratuitously, to bring him to the bar?" "Well, for all that, I'll never marry a poor printer. I did have a tender regard for him once; but when I gave him my hand I deemed him somebody; so I acted from the promptings of the heart; but now I'll be ruled vy my better judgment." "Well, please yourself in this matter, my dear; but I'm disposed to think honorably of- but la t me, if he isn't at the door now." Scarcely had she done speaking when our hero entered, and with heart overflowing with gratitude and love, sprang forward to greet the object of his idoltray; but imagine his surprise and dismay when he received in return a cold, dis- tant cpurtsy, which froze his blood and rooted him to the spot. Bewildered and astonished at such greeting from his fair betrothed, he turned for explanation to her mother, who, perceiving the general embarrassment, stepped for- ward, and offering him a seat, explained to him that since her daughter's return from- the Springs, she had, after 4      38   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   mature reflection, and examining her heart, thought it best to dissolve the engagement made between them. The ruddy cheeks of the youth became of an ashy pale- ness, and his bloodless lips quivered like an an aspen leaf, as he falteringly exclaimed, "and wherein is my offence? Have I merited this? Good heavens! and is this the gentle, the tender, the confiding Emily Carrington?" "Sir, this is not the stage of a theatre, on which to enact scenes," now spoke up the daughter; "let it suffice to know we are ever henceforth to be stranger to each other. You attempted to deceive me, and pass yourself off for a gentleman, when it turns out you are of the working classes, only a printer, a portionless journeyman, a fortune- seeker. If you had an honorable profession, sir, and were of good family, as I once fondly thought, we could be united; but, as it is, I cannot, and will not, descend so low. Bah! I smell the ink on him now!" and as the lady thus spoke, she tossed her head, and with a look of ineffa- ble scorn and contempt, proudly sailed out of the room. Overwhelmed with dismay, and stung to the quick, the young man sat paralized many moments; but recovering somewhat from the shock, rose, and sto ;ered out of the room. Alas! how crushed were his hopes, how dreary were all things now! Deceived, slighted, wronged, confi- dence betrayed, laughed at, and treated with scorn and contempt by one whom he adored and loved, alas! too well! and all for being a " low-bred, base mechanic." And rushing madly to the inn, he threw himself despairingly upon his humble cot, from which he did not rise for two long months; for the unwonted excitement and disappoint- ment of the morning had brought on a burning fever. From morn till night, and night till morn, the patient raved, a wild maniac, calling and conjuring his Emily to come back to him, and with his impatience and querrulous-   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   ness wearied all about him-all, save one. The physician despaired of restoring him, and resigned him to the care of the gentle Nannie, who watched at his bedside from night till day with unremitting assiduity, bore with his weakness, administered to his wants with kindness, and soothed his irritated spirits, by the gentlest words and treatment. Finally, after the lapse of several weeks, he began slowly to recover, and reason returned once more. When, having entirely recovered, he thanked the kind hostess and her daughter, with tearful eyes and heart over- flowing with gratitude for their kindness in watching him in his weakness and infirmities. He called Nannie his pre- server, his guardian angel, and told her he owed to her his life, and that he would ever hold her in grateful remem- brance, and though he was then about to depart, and would not see her again for years, yet when fortune smiled on him again she should hear from him. Till then, he bade her a sorrowful, a tearful, farewell, and departed. Years passed, and still the unfortunate stranger was unheard of, and almost forgotten, by the good gossips of Salem, and even by the one who had caused his misfortunes, Emily Carrington, herself. Yet, there was one in that little village who still gave him a place, not only in her memory, but also in her heart. It was the daughter of the hostess. Five years from the events just related, Richmond was crowded to overflowing, for the Legislature was in session, and had brought with it its usual retinue of strangers, office and pleasure seekers. It was by far the gayest sea- sen the capital had seen for many years, and balls, parties, soirees, and pic-nics followed each other with. unabated zest. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  40    AMERICAN N  jTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. Gorgeous lights streamed from a score of windows from one of Pearl street's stateliest mansions, and sounds of music and revelry are heard within. Luscious and sylph- like forms skip over the richly carpeted floors, and veinera- ble matrons and grave gentlemen sit comfortably in the back-ground talking politics, gossiping, and admiring the light-hearted, the lovely, and the happy beings around them. We will draw near one of these companies--that one near the chandelier, consisting of two gentlemen and a lady, and listen; and as we are incog., it matters but little if we are caught evesdropping. ' It is just as you say, Col. Carrington, the Legislature has done but little as yet; still I think they have redeemed themselves somewhat by one judicious act, in appointing our young friend, David T. Patterson, to the first judicial judgeship. ' A very proper appointment, sir, very; but yonder he is now-see, the servant is just ushering him into the room. "La, me, pa!" exclaimed the young lady, admiringly; "how interesting he looks; and so young, too, to be appointed judge!" "He is a clever young man, Emily, and talented, too, or he never would have been honored with the distinguished office just conferred on him." "How I would like to becomC acquainted with him! Pa, pray introduce him?" "Most assuredly I will do so; for here he comes now." "A pleasant evening to you gentlemen. Col. Carring- ton, pray how do you do?" "Quite well, I thank you, Judge Patterson. Permit me to make you acquainted with my daughter? Judge Pat- terson, Miss Carrington." With low, defferential courtsy     the young lady greeted the gentleman, and seated him beside her. With many an art and wile did she attempt to amuse, please, and insinuate herself into the good graces of the admired and promising young Judge. But her efforts were vain, her arrows were aimed at a heart of steel; and the countenance of the Judge, the while, wore a contemptuous and sneering expression, that baffled all her arts and penetration. "Heavens! what a face, how lovely, how angelic! But rnethinks I should know that countenance," exclaimed the Judge, as he caught the beautiful black eyes of a lovely lady, in a distant part of the room, riveted full upon him "Who, sir ; the young lady in the black velvet mantilla  Ha! ha! ha! that's my protege; she is an orphan; her parent was a maitre de hotel in Salem; so, being alone, I took her under my charge; and right useful I find her. She answers both as a companion and maid. I would not have brought her here, but she seems so sad and melan- cholly, that pa would make me bring her, thinking it might revive her drooping spirits." "It is, itris, the pure, the gentle Nannie Alvey! How fortunate! Pray Miss Carrington excuse me; but I know you will, when I inform you that I am 'only a printer;' the poor mechanic you scorned, jilted, and derided, many years ago, in the little village of Salem:" and, rising unceremo- niously, the young man hastily crossed the room, leaving the haughty girl covered with shame and confusion to weep over her folly. It was the lovely Nannie! and with beating heart, eyes sparkling with joy, and countenance suffused with blushes, the fair being welcomed the equally happy and excited young man. Much as Miss Carrington suffered by the gnawings of conscience, much as she upbraids herself, much as she 4*       42    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. grieves and sorrows over her past conduct, her pride, her sore disappointment,-her punishment; yet, in a few weeks ? after, when the admired Judge Patterson led the happy and envied Nannie to the altar, she could but acknowledge - that the punishment was just, that it was merited. Judge Patterson and his lady now live happily, prosper" ously, and contentedly together; but Emily Carrington, unhappy girl, is still a spinster--an old maid. ! *                  %-w J   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     43 T HI R D I*T G - WET. AT an early hour the White House was filled to over- flowing, for it had been circulated through the day that the I celebrated Aaron Brown would entertain them. We repaired, with all the world of Washington, to the President's mansion, and arrived just in time to hear the Governor recount the following strange incidents, which he called ADVENTURES IN THE CAROLINAS; Or, My First Jaunt After Goods. Who has not visited, in the sultry months of summer, that fair country surnamed the "Switzerland of America?" Who has not beheld her towering mountains, broad valleys, and majestic rivers, where you respire an invigorating atmosphere, and drink of pure fountains, where Gentlest gales, Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper, whence They stole those balmy spoils." Ladies and gentlemen, if you have not visited this fair land, go with me in imagination, and I will show you its beauties; I will show you a people simple in their habits, honest in their dealings, gentle ind lospitable in times of peace, brave and daring in times of war, and free from the corruptions of cities, and the contaminating influences of the world. I will show  you, too the dusky savage as     "   AIMERICAN NIGHTS9 ENTERTAINMENTS.    he bends from some mountain height, as he views this vari- egated country, once the broad domain of his ancestors, and his own by right of heritage. The Indian damsel may also be seen, as she sports and gambols on the flowery green in front of her father's wigwam. Here you will listen to the lays of a thousand winged songsters; to the bound of the startled wolf;-but high above these may be heard the roaring of the majestic Watauga, as she struggles, and mur- murs, and groans in her slow travail, wending her circuitous way from the mountain fastness in which she had been pent so long, to lose herself in the fond embraces of the Holston. These are the scenes where the strength of my manhood was passed, and where, too, I expect to pass the evening of my life, and at last to repose in some quiet nook of her grassy surface. Though our life has been an eventful one, and many, of its incidents quite marvelous, yet I will not vouch for its being interesting to others, though to me it is full of pleas- ing reminiscences. Full many a green spot is there in it to which I often turn for happiness and rest. I find many an oasis, full of flowers of the richest and rarest hue; pleasing memories and sunny smiles are also there. By indulging in reveries of the past, I am enabled to soothe my infirmities, and laugh ennui to scorn. I was born of respectable parentage in the city of --, in the year 1800, where I resided until the year 18-, when my father, not content with the plodding routine of city life, must needs go to some distant clime, where he could more easily replenish his purse with gold, and leave vherewithal to maintain his children when he himself should have gone to a more distant clime, " from whose bourne no traveler returns." Accordingly, we emigrated to Jones- borough, a small village in East Tennessee.    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.     45   My father being a retail merchant, apprenticed me to his business, giving me, instead of the hoop, the bat, and ball, as usual with boys of my size, the scissors and yard- stick, which came quite as naturally, and with more advan- tage to me. Here I continued patiently and dutifully, like a good son, till, by, the aid of hair tonics, pomatums, and bear's oil, I was enabled to sport a very respectable and bewitching pair of whiskers. Having arrived at man's estate, I concluded to resign my clerkly vocation, in order that I might gratify the ruling desire of my life, the passion that sustained and buoyed me up through many a weary month and year. Night after night I pored over descrip- tions of our country; over the travels and adventures of my fellow-men. Time after time had I listened to the legends of the neighboring yeomanry, and the hair-breadth escapes and warlike deeds of the Indians, when they came in to barter off their furs for beads, tomahawks, blankets, and other articles of vanity or want of the savage tribes. My spirits yearned to be free. I longed to travel and view this great country, of which I had-heard so much, that I might behold her growing cities, her peaceful villages, and above all, her brave sons and fair daughters. - Although but a verdant and unsophisticated youth, yet I must needs loosen my bark, and push off without compass or rudder into the wide world. My father, like a true Yankee, must needs make me kill two birds with one stone. He instructed me to proceed to Charleston, at once, and replenish our stock of goods, and then to devote a month or two, if I saw proper, to myself. -I needed not a second bidding. Having received my father's blessing, with a cordial grasp of the hand, along with a good, stout horse, a well-filled purse,and the admonition to ever strive and "make two dimes where I spent one," I bid farewell to my friends one fine October morning, and     like Don Quixote, of happy memory, " set out to recon- noitre." I bent my way towards the, then, only Southern mart. The second day after my departure I was obliged to pass through a thinly-settled portion of country. Although now it is densely populated, yet at that time I traveled hours in succession without seeing a single house or passing a single individual.           4 pTowards evening I became apprehensive I would not reach a place of shelter for the night. At the close of evening, however, I saw, at a short distance from the main road, a small cabin, of rude but somewhat pleasing exterior, whither I directed my course to inquire the distance to the first house of entertainment. "Good evening, sir," said I, to a rough-looking old man, as I rode up to the door; " how far is it to the next inn?" "Which way are you traveling?" inquired the man. "To the South," I replied ; "I have seen but the one road these two days. Can you inform me the distance to the next inn?" "Where are you from, stranger?" asked the man. "Oh! don't be in a hurry," he continued, rolling a quid of tobacco in his mouth, and stretching himself lazily on a rude rail- ing upon which he was leaning. I began to grow rather impatient, and answered a little sharply, "-I'm from Jonesborough, sir, and on my way to Charleston; my name is Aaron Brown, merchant; aged twenty ; bachelor. Now can you'answer my interrogatory? The evening wanes." "To the next inn?" echoed the man; "why, yes: I guess it's fifteen miles." "And must I travel fifteen miles before I get lodging?" I inquired.   "'Zactly so, sir, uiless Mrs. Avery will take you in; she sometimes takesin travelers." "How far is it then, to Mrs. Avery's" "She lives just ten miles off, sir; the second house you come across on the right-hand side of the road." "Thank you, sir, for your information," I replied. "This section of country seems to be rather thinly settled," I continued, willing to prolong a moment my conversation with this rare genius of the back-woods. "Rather," drawled out the man, in reply. "You grow fine corn, here, sir," said I, turning to a fine field of maize, indented in the thick forest, and ready for the harvest. "How do you manage to use it?" "s Oh, as for that matter, stranger, we stills it all up into liquor, 'cept what little we waste for bread." ' "Humph!" muttered I to myself, as I rode off; " what manner of man is he?" After a couple of hours wandering in the night through dark forests, capable of exciting the emotions of a back- woodsman or squatter, but as yet untouched by either, I reached the dwelling of Mrs. Avery. It was a large, commodious dwelling, built in that style in which taste and convenience are blended harmoniously together. Usually in works of comfort and necessity, beauty and utility go together. He who disregards taste in his family mansion, disregards convenience; and the one cannot exist without the other. Such was the case in the dwelling before me, in which these objects seemed to have been kept in view.. The lawn in front was arranged with walks, shade trees, and parterres, and altogether the premises appeared to be the residence of persons of wealth and taste. As I rode up the avenue, and came in front of the house, a young lady came out on the piazza.  She was one of the     48    AMERICAN NIGHTS5 ENTERTAINMENTS.  most lovely creatures I had ever beheld. I confess my heart was smitten at first sight, and I may remark, en passant, that I am not one likely to be smitten by every pretty face. "Your servant, Miss' said I, as I touched my hat. "Can I be accommodated with lodging for the night?" "Why, sir, it is not our custom to entertain strangers and travelers; however, wait a moment, and I'll go and seei ma," she replied, as she tripped into the house. "Ma! sister! James! the handsomest'young man you ever saw is at the door, and wishes lodging for the night. Pray, Ma, let's take him in; he is so, handsome, and looks so tired." "Why, what a flurry you are in! Well, tell the hand- some stranger to alight, and ring the bell for a servant to take his horse; we may as well take him in, as the gen- tleman who arrived an hour or two ago." I still sat on my horse, and in such a position as enabled me through the gloom of the evening to witness the inter- view between the mother and daughter. The casement was raised, and from the bright light which shone in the inte- rior, I was tempted to gaze in on the cheerfulness and com- fort it betokened. I saw the daughter, as she looked up into the mother's face. Her lovely countenance was ani- mated with smiles, her dark eyes beamed with kindness, and her rosy lips, as they parted, left a tender a6 earnest impression on her features as she plead for the weary stranger. Presently she came forth and informed me, with the sweetest smile imaginable, that my request was granted. I dismounted, and was conducted into a large room, where I found the gentleman who had arrived before I rode up, sit- ting at a table, and " doing the agreeable" over the remains of a roast turkey and pig.

" This gentleman, whose name was M  ajor Aiken (for as uch he introduced himself to me), was a respectable-look- lg, middle-aged man, dressed in the prevailing fashion of   . ie day. The dress coat he wore was of blue broadcloth ith huge collar, stiff lappets, and running down to a point the form commonly known as the "swallow-tail," from e resemblance it had to the caudal appendage of that ecies of the feathered tribe. His vest was of striped tin, with large flaps, and huge pockets, from one of which gold snuff-box protruded. The good lady, our hostess, took the M ajor's hint, and ;h a smile, ordered wine and c igars, and then left us to o ; ourselves alone.

"Hip, hurrah, a good round health To our kind hostess fair; She hath not only meat and drink, But beauties the most rare!" said my eccentric comrade, as he turned off his glass and drained its contents. Touching his glass, and imitating his example, I repeated 6"And here's a health to her daughter fair; May her life be as bright as she; May neither sorrow, grief, or care, Becloud her happy sky." "' Which way are you traveling, my boy?"' 1"Towards the South, Sir." "As I am traveling the same way myself, I shall be happy of your company." "I shall be equally happy, indeed," I replied. And I was well pleased with the prospect of traveling with such an odd and quaint companion. Supper over, we retired to separate apartments for the night.  I retired to bed, but not to sleep, although I felt fatigued j and wearied after my long ride. My mind was restless, j and I indulged in a train of pleasing reflections and reve- ries, in which my good landlady's daughter played a con.- spicuous part. Who has not, in youth, when the passions / are feverish, the mind active, and the imagination buoyant  and strong, thus tossed himself on his couch, " chewing thek cud of sweet and bitter fancy," even until the " witching  hour of night?"

At length the moon passed beyonda the western hills, her light ceased to shine into my chamber,  AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     51 and profound darkness and stillness began to reign.. My mind ceased to be restless; my wearied limbs sunk into slumber; but vague fancies still floated across my imagin- ation. Methought I was seated on the lawn in front of Mrs. Avery's dwelling, with her lovely daughter by my side. We were watching thq setting of the sun in the west. The dark masses of clouds above him were tinged with his golden rays, throwing a mantle of the brightest colors over his departure. Suddenly it seemed to me that the bright, golden embroidery of the heavy masses of clouds ceased to appear in waving lines; a bright flash streamed across the heavens, and a loud clap of thunder reverberated along the skies. Instantly I awoke, but the sound seemed still to linger on my ears. I started up in bed, when I was horrified at new sounds issuing from another part of the building. Shriek after shriek, of the most heart-rending character, fell upon my ear; and from the low, plaintive wail which succeeded, I judged these cries of agony to proceed from a female. I sprang from my bed ; seizing my pistols, which I had placed on the table by my side, and throwing a cloak over my shoulders, I rushed out on the stairway. Here I heard the vigorous and manly tones of Major Aiken's voice, shouting, "Light, ho . bring a light, till we ferret out the villains! You black scamp, you, bring a light, and don't stand there chattering like a frightened monkey." Springing down the stairs, I made for the principal entrance of the house, which, having gained, I passed through the first door, which was thrown wide open, on to the piazza. I knew that if robbers or burglars had attacked the house, they would make their retreat at the first alarm. Nor was I deceived; for scarce had I looked around into the darkness of the night, when I perceived, at about an   hundred yards distance, the faint glimmer of a light, which appeared to be borne hurriedly along, now and then disap- pearing as it passed behind the forest trees still growing in the yard in front of the house. Quick as thought I leaped down the piazza, and bounded over the intervening space with such light, steady steps, that, even now, I am sur- prised at this miraculous celerity. "'Stop!"I shouted to the ruffian, who was trying to make his escape; " stop, or I will fire!" She seemed to fly faster for a moment after hearing my -voice ; but presently, deeming escape impossible, from the rapidity with which I gained upon him, he stopped, turned Found, an d shouted, with a hoarse, quick voice, "Come on, then, if you hold life so cheap!" at the same time he breathed forth an oath which I care not to repeat. The light was scarce sufficient to enable me to make out where he was; but springing in the direction of the sound, endeavored to come up to him. As I did so, a limb sway- ing down from a neighboring tree caught my cloak, which Still hung to my shoulders, and drew me for a second to one side, the cloak being drawn partly off my body. While in this position the villain fired. I felt a sharp twinge in my left arm, which suddenly dropped; but dis- regarding it, I raised my pistol, and taking deliberate ainm at the object in front, I fired, and sprang instantly towards i-t,. It dropped; but as I stooped over it I was horror-struck eto see thrown over the arm of a man the frail, tender formm of a woman.                  h There seemed to be a gurgling in the man's throat, as if it proceeded from one in the agonies of death. He clutched. at a knife which clung at his side, and, with curses, wasI about to strike it into the seemingly inanimate female hang-, iug upon him. I seized at his hand to intercept the stroke.; The knife became entangled in the cloak that I threw out!    aluasvuwAN NIOaTS' ENTERTAINMENTg.    53 3 O protect myself; but his strength was fast failing, and e gradually inclined backwards, and suddenly dropped on le earth with a groan.              o herth t a groan. The spirit, to all appearances had eparted.                    had I seized the dark lantern which had fallen from the vil- in's hand, and opening it, the light streamedout on the ects before me. The man was lying upon his back, and e   person of the female was thrown across him, her hair  Ieaming over her shoulders, and the blood flowing from  e pistol-shot in the man's side spouting over her bosom.  tching a view of her pale features, I staggered back as beheld those of the beautiful Ada, the object of my amsa . m s She was gagged and bound hand and foot. Lights were v flitting through the yard; servants were running hither I thither. I shouted to them, and was answered by jor Aiken, ", Ho! where are you? Havlre the Philistines ke loose, or has the world come to an end, and tihe ked fleeing from justice?"

"Great God!" he exclaimed, ,  is our landlady's daughter? and carried off by this vil- saying which, he stooped down, and carefully raised n his arms, and bore her to the house. The gag was ved, her limbs were released from their bonds, and ' means used to restore animation. Her mother hung 5*Her              mtru A       over her, wringing her hands, and imploring her daughter to speak, in the most heart-rending accents. The ball from the pistol, it appeared, had passed close to her head, sever- ing some of the rich auburn locks that clustered there in :ich profusion. Meantime, I returned to my own room, to examine the state of my wounds, which, from a feeling of exhaustion, I now for the first time experienced, I began to think were serious. I found that the pistol-shot had merely gazed the bone on the upper side of my arm, and that the wound -as slight. The blow of the knife had scarcely touched tree fleshy part of the right hand, inflicting a wound, which, although it bled freely, was of little consequence. While making these examinations, Major Aiken came in, exclaiming "c As Milton says, ' hail, horrors, hail!' for by Jupiter Ammon, here they are! What! my boy, you're wart. Look here at the blood I Fool that I was, not to think of you sooner." So saying, the kind gentleman took a large handkerchief from his pocket, and tearing it into strips, bound up my wounds with the promptitude of a man accustomed to such things. "You see, my boy," he said, while engaged in the operation, "I have had some experience in such mat- orts. I have been in the Indian wars, and have done the ;lme office to my comrades on the bloody field. But what ncew clamor is that?" This last exclamation of the Major was caused by a fresh out break of grief from the family, which it will be neces- wJ to explain. It appears that the servants, on going up stairs to see ;-hat depredations the villain had committed, had first a-tered the ladies' apartment'. When they entered the comr they found Mrs. Avery's youngest daughter, Fanny, gagg ed, bound hand and foot, and stretched out on the 3 \.^ce         I   floor in a swoon. After removing the bonds that tied her, and displacing the gag, she soon revived, no further injury having been done her. Next, they hastened to the apart- ment of Mrs. Avery's eldest son, James, as he had not yet made his appearance. Great God! what a spectacle! There he lay, bound as the others, but with a great gash across the neck, from which the blood poured in streams. This was the cause of the new outhreak of sorrow. Major Aiken now made his appearance, and examined the wound. Though severe, it was found not to be fatal. He soon dresed the incision, and closed it up with a piece of adhesive plaster. Mrs. Avery now made her appearance, informing us that her daughter had revived, though still weak from fright and anxiety. The new calamity of her son James affected her deeply. She stood for a moment in speechless agony. The Major comforted her as much as he was able, assuring her that, though badly wounded, with care, his situation was not dangerous. He was going on to explain the effects of-wounds, the manner of healing, and other matters, which the afflicted widow listened to mechanically, and seeming to comprehend the meaning of his discourse, when one of the servants came running in, exclaiming that the assassin was Carl Lindsey, of the Knob." This diverted the lady's attention. "The villain!" she exclaimed. " Well, well, the matter is now explained." "What matter?" the Major asked, inquiringly. "Why, gentlemen, this Lindsey, though exceedingly wealthy, and of good family, is one of the most notorious. ruffians and consummate villains for miles around. Years ago he became enamored of one of my daughters, but as often as he paid his suit he was firmly repulsed, until his importunities became so great, that at last he was rejected    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. 57   56    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTBRTAINMENTS. with scorn and contempt. But a short time ago he insulted my daughter Ada, on hier return from a neighbor's house, by his brutal addresses; but James paid him well for it, by knocking him from his horse with a loaded whip, which he carried, and rode off and left him lying in the highway. He swore then he would have my daughter, and deep, deadly revenge for the blow given him by James." "Well, madam, you will not be troubled with this danger- ous visitor and persevering suitor again. This brave youth here has, in fair field, laid his head so low, that no mortal power can raise it again. While I congratulate the fair Ada on being deprived of so desperate a lover as Carl Lind- sey, I trust that she may find a better and more acceptable one in her stout deliverer. Ha! ha! ha! Aaron, boy, I thought I could bring the color to your cheeks again. But this man Carl is as desperate as a pirate, and harbors revenges like a savage ;-revenge, the foulest and most accursed of the wickedness engendered in the human heart. With such a desperate character to deal with, we ought to be thankful his revenge was no worse. By Jupiter, he might have murdered us all, and burnt us up, making a bonfire of us! But let us adjourn, and once more seek repose." Saying which, the Major and I left the apart- ment, and sought our own, where, after dozing for a while, the day broke in the East.   FO URTH INIGaH T l WHEREIN THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES HS art '    NARRATIVE. MY wounds being too severe to set out immediately on the further prosecution of my journey, I was obliged to remain a week longer at the hospitable mansion of Mrs. Avery. Although the Major made some indications of preparing to resume his journey, the good landlady would not permit it, declaring his skill in medicine was absolutely necessary to the safety of the invalids. I reminded him also of his promise to accompany me in his travels further South, upon which the good man declared his readiness to tarry a while longer, saying, in his usual bold, off-hand manner, "My home is everywhere. Sometimes in forests, some- times on the rolling deep; sometimes in cities, and some- times in the quiet of the country, I spend my days. I have roamed in all climes; mingled with all the tribes and tongues of the human family, and care little where my resting-place is for the moment, provided I have the wherewithal to eat, drink, and be happy.  That's my philosophy; and I hold it to be better than that of Socrates, or any other of the heathens of his day." Painful as my wounds were at first, they soon gave me more ease; and possessing a vigorous and stout constitu- tion, I rapidly recovered. Ada, though still pale and fee-     68    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. ble, regained her usual vivacity of mind; and Fanny, the sprightly and buoyant Fanny, was, in a short time, "her- self again." Did I pass my time pleasantly? In the mild evenings of October, when nature sadly puts on her yellow livery, the heart and mind of man are in a fit condi- tion to muse, and to be pleasingly sad. Often would Ada  and I sit on the piazza, and look out into the surrounding forests, tinged here and there with the yellow leaf, and, in places, completely bare, and moralize on the fading nature of human life. At those times a sadness would linger on her countenance; but it would soon pass away, like the transitory cloud fleeting through tfe sky, and all would 'be light and life again. Can I say that in such moments, descanting on such themes, our minds were tuned in unison, and our hearts to throb with the same emotions? Can I say that our sympathies mingled together, and that a feel- ing of confidence was inspired between us? The only answer I can give to such questions, is to say, that the time passed pleasantly and rapidly by, for " things so heavenly have such fleetness." Who is there among mankind that cannot look to some period of his life, which passed away  as rapidly and delightfully as a pleasant dream? We all  can refer to whispered conversations, pleasing rambles, delightful and sprightly discussions, and all those agreeable  passages of our life, that make certain periods of it charm- ing and enchanting. The Major spent much of his time in rambling out in search of game, which was at that time plentiful; the remainder he spent in attending to his patients, joking with Fanny, conversing with the widow, and making sport with the servants and dogs. He was truly a boisterous and good-humored companion. James slowly recovered from his wounds, and I got well apace. At the end of a fortnight I was again able to i   AMERICAN NIGHTS  ENTERAINMENTS     59 resume my journey, and no excuse now remained to protract our stay: we therefore made preparations to start. The next morning after coming to this determination we took  an early breakfast, and ordered our horses to be brought, to renew our journey. The whole family gathered around     us, except James, who was unable to leave his room, thank- ing us, again and again, with tears in their eyes, for the timely service we rendered them. The beautiful Ada stood'  on the piazza, expressing her gratitude only with the tears that stood in her gentle eyes; and I confess when I took   i  her hand in mine to bid freell, itwas done in rther intention, at the same time singg, i hias one in peuiar manner,         e    trembled a s I bade I Farewell, Jenny Sau"ders, farewell,  I am sorr o leave you, I loveyou so swell!"nt.  shPolitelyo bowing to th e widw nd giving a familiar nod  to the servants, he mounted his horse, I instantly folaoin g  his example, and we galloped down the avenue in fronts aware of his the wid  o  n.

The Major confinement, pleasing though it was tivity.              o    to  As w  as formerly remarked, the country through which  ,     we traveled was but thinly settled by the whites. Miles on miles intervened between one rude cabin of the settler and another; dense forests, untouched by the hand of civ- ilization, spread out their dark solitudes, through which various animals of the chase and ravenous beasts of prey roamed almost undisturbed. The Catawha and Cherokee Indians, however, were to be found in this country in great numbers. They maintained a hollow peace with the whites; their revengeful disposition, and nursing past wrongs, now and then exciting them, when little was to be- apprehended from retaliation, to commit various depradations on the whites. The settlers were, to a great extent, exempt from the infliction of their attrocities, as the Indians well knew that they were bound together for their mutual defence by the strongest bond that can possibly actuate mankind- that of self-preservation. They well knew that any outrage committed onthe settlers would be certainly and fearfully avenged. But travelers passing through that region were not so safe. Often would the terrible whoop of the savages fall upon the ear of the unwary wanderer, and- ere he could prepare for defence, or endeavor to escape, the vengeance of these fierce men of the woods would be wreaked upon him, and his goary scalp hang dripping at the girdle of the red man. The Major was aware of this, and cau- tioning me to be prepared, he drew forth the pistols from their holsters, and inspected their condition, which example I immediately followed. We carried no other weapons of offence or defence, except a large hunting knife each, con- cealed in the folds of our cloaks, knowing well that if the Indians attacked us, they would first approach us in a friendly manner, and examine into our condition; and then, if satisfied, would fall upon us, and endeavor to over- power us by numbers.   ie firt day we passed over a beautiful and picturesue on of country. Towering mountains, which seemed to heir hoary heads to the clouds, and support the arch e heavens; deep ravines, dark and gloomy, the air wild beast, and the refuge of birds of ill omen; fer- lleys, and dense growth of timber-the scene of after- ation, and the residence of a thriving and contented ation-successively presented themselves to view. The had now thrown^off her mantle of green, and robed f in the light, variegated, but saddening drapery of n.  ines of rich clustering grapes presented them- to our view, hanging in heavy festoons, in all the ion of nature in her wildest mood; the ground, too, casionally found strewn with chesnuts, of which we ourselves plentifully through the day. Lsionally we passed the light wigwam of the Indian, i some cases of bark, and the interstices daubed with in others, skins stretched across poles fastened in the by a stake, and joined together at the top, a hole eft in the apex through which the blue wreathe of oke escaped.

AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTRTAINMENTS.  Thus we traveled all day, until night overtook us in the midst of adenseforest. As it became exceedingly dark, mi  d     go no farther in Search of the hut of settler for accommodations for the night, but resolved t seek a convenient place by the side of a small rivulet, over- hung by the branches of thick, clustering trees. Here  the ungor drew forth a small hatchet from his portmanteau r i and lopped off the branches of the trees around him, and, throwing them into a pile , roceededto ch, throikeng light soon hscl a bright aud cheerful fire, which, throwing its oonruddy li ht around on the forest trees, made the scene one of romantic interest In the meantime I hopned the horses, f mndset them forth to graze for the night; after which I anproduced my ortmanteau, which I found crammed with ch eese, caked veison, ham, bottles of wine, and other with cheese, cakes venisone by our kind and grate-  edibles and beverages, placed there by our kind and grate-  ful hostess. We soon seated oursel hves on log , close to the fire, which blazed nd crackled in the chill e vening -ir and drawing forth our viands, which, tho, uh not as theory as might be procured at Willar's, yet, to us, it was the most welcome repast of which we ever partook.

Here, give me a swig at the bottle, and let the generous heart leap at the inspiration of the sparkling wine." Saying which, he took up one of the bottles, and, from the length of time he held it to his lips, I should judge that he relished it as a "  part and parcel" in that "  object of pleasure" to which he had just signified his adherence. "But," said I, " you surely would not wish all men to agree with you in practice, even if they did in sentiment. The world would present a queer spectacle if we all went1 forth to enjoy the ' freedom of the wild, untrodden woods.' Although I participate in your sentiments in regard to the enchanted feeling of untrammeled independence, in roam- ing over the waste places of nature unfettered and undis- turbed, yet I plainly see that it would not be well for all the world to be of the same opinion." "By the gown of Calliope!" replied the Major, giving me a hearty slap upon the back, " but you'll turn orator yet, and beat even the ' untutored Indians of the wilds,' whose eloquence people think proper to praise so much in these modern days. I reckon it's because they're heathens, as it is the custom to praise the heathens, such as Demos- thenes and Tully. But I almost forgot to reply to your remark. I agree with you that it would not be well for all the world to follow my example; for there's the women-- they couldn't stand it. Some must stay at home to take care of them. And if I should judge from that parting salutation I saw you make not a hundred days ago, I doubt not but that you would be better pleased in taking care of one of them, than here in this dark forest, talking to a traveler like myself. Ha! ha! ha!" "Well, but, Major, you avoid the question," I answered,     "   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        f willing to escape the confusion this last remark caused ime by making an accusation against him ; for I still recollected the parting salutation made at the end of the avenue, and which I thought had been unobserved by the Major: but it seems I was mistaken, for his quick eye had caught the movement. . "Oh, never mind, my boy," replied he; "we're not holding a controversy about fate, free will, free grace, con- science, and such like subtleties, which require those who dispute upon them to be governed by strict, unvarying, logi- cal rules. I'll thank you for a slice of that cheese; it looks delicious." Complying with the Major's request, I continued the  conversation by asking, "My dear sir, does not this feeling ! of pleasure, of which Epicurus makes so much, have some- thing to do with the mind? Surely the welfare of the body, creature comforts, and a hearty appetite, cannot sat- isfy the cravings of -the immortal mind." "You put your question well, young man," replied the major, gravely; "but if you just go according to the ancient saying, mens sana in corpore sano,-a sane mind in a sound body,--you will see the fitness of the observ- ation. On the contrary, instead of the wild, free life of the hunter being injurious to the development of the men- tal faculties, if properly directed, it is certainly conducive to their healthful training. I will admit that he is thrown into more temptation to injure and harden his mind to all the finer sensibilities of the heart; but these temptations may be resisted. Besides, in the midst of civilization and refinement, men may do acts signifying a gentle and kind disposition, when at the same time their hearts are really cruel and hard. But in the life of a hunter, the life of the untrammeled wanderer, no such influence operates. His acts are the effects of the promptings of his nature ; his   AMRICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     65 d heart is made bare in all that he says and in all that he does." "Well, I returned, laughing, " you certainly state your case rather strongly. Here's the Indian; and I'll admit that he is the freest and most, untrammeled hunter that I roams the forest. And yet, in cunning, in stratagem, in snares, he has no superior.  ow do How do you reconcile this matter with your opinions?"  "Tut! tut!" exclaimed the Major, " your complete savage has a mind which I always thought was in two parts-bifurcated, as the botanists say. A thin partition divides the rugged craniums through the centre of the scalp lock. On one side is plainly written revenge-on the other gratitude; plainly, at least to me. Excite the one, and you have the bitterest and most unrelentin g enemy; excite the other, and a warmer or more devoted friend you would not wish to possess."        d  "That may all be true, but it does not establish your proposition. Come, now, give it up that you are partial to the life of a  wanderer because you have followed it yourself. " "Perhaps," the   Major answered, musingly,  'perhaps you  have judged me rightly. Ido not deny being partial  to traveling, and roaming about, somewhat in the manner of Don Quixote, in search of   adventures. It has not always been the case with me, though; I was once a sober settler, and contented by m y ow n fireside." f "And that reminds me of a question I had thought to ask   you b efore nowr that is, will you relate to me the inci- dents of your life, or at least those parts which you may consider of general interest, and not too nearly touching your private affairs." "Willingly I  will do so, m yug  rien You will not 'in it toi   TeeSO "Y yOung friend. ou willn t  find much in it to inte t you; but as we have little to do,       and anything to while away our time will be of service, I will tell you a few scraps of my history." Saying which, the Major drew near the fire, we having finished our repast, and fixing himself on a log, placed himself at his ease. "As you seem anxious to hear my story," the Major commenced, wiping his large hunting-knife, and drawing forth a steel tooth-pick from some secret place in the back, with which he plied his masticators, "I shall relate, for your edification, a few of its leading incidents. Singular, very singular, they are, indeed. And these incidents, my young friend, will show you what great events are some- times connected with very insignificant circumstances, and how mysterious are the ways of Providence in bringing about changes in the condition of many of his dependent creatures. You will find in tracing the history of almost every man, that some are brought low, even to the dust, by the most trivial circumstances, while others are raised to opulence by occurrences equally trifling. It was a mistake in the ancients to represent fortune as blind: the Disposer of the events of the world is not blind, but only those who are the instruments therein. "I was born and raised not a hundred miles from the city of Charleston, on the banks of the Santee river, in the State of South Carolina. My father was considered a planter of tolerable wealth, and was honored and respected by his neighbors accordingly ; that being the great desid- eratunm to a man's respectability. Quietly and happily I passed the earlier part of my life, and, although it was without incident worthy of being noted, yet it was full of bliss. Twenty years I passed under my father's roof, in affluence and ease, a perfect stranger to the world, its sor- rows and its cares. Even now I can look back to that period of the past, and catch some of the calm, quiet emo-   ! tions that then stirred my youthful bosom--stirred it gently and pleasurably.                g "One morning, one warm, sultry morning, (methinks I shall never forget it,) my father, with dimmed eyes and saddened face, collected together his family, and with a trembling voice, told us he was a ruined man--a bankrupt; that he had endorsed notes for a friend for fifteen thousand dollars, and although he had reposed the utmost confidence in him, yet he proved to be insolvent. Through this fail- ure on the part of his principal, he would have every dol- lar for which he had endorsed to pay. In order to do that he would have to sacrifice his all, unless he could get aid from his uncle in Charleston, on whom he held notes to the amount of a few thousand dollars. "You may rest assured that it was a severe shock to me, as also to the rest of the family, who had never known what it was to toil or want. "Yes,' exclaimed my father I will discharge this debt though we are all made beggars by it. It is ard indeed. Years of unremitting toil-these broad acres, which de- scended to me fr ol my father-will sloon be gone! lost forever by the treachery of one on whose integrity I would have staked nmy life. :But what avails it to grieve, mv children? Misfortune cannot be assisted by sorrow. Make all haste and prepare, mny son , said be, turning to me, 'to set out fo. Charleston to-morrow morning, and get what succor you can from Uncle Gallagher. Pray God he may be enabled to assist me in averting the pending calamity.' "Bright and early I was up next mor ning; and ere the $un made his appearance over  the eastern hills, I was m any miles on my way to Charleston. On any other occasion eand under any  other circumstances, my heart W ould have leaped for joy at the prospect of going for the first time to that busy and thriving city.     68    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.. "But it was a sad, sad journey to me. My heart was with the disconsolate at home, grieving, not so much for myself as for others, who were dear, very dear to me. "Nothing unusual occurred in the progress of my first jaunt from home, and I soon found myself in Charleston, and seated as comfortably as circumstances would admit at - my Uncle Gallagher's. "Here I found, to my mortification and disappointment that he could give me no aid at present, having recently met with some heavy losses himself, and being then very much pressed for money. 'Although,' said he, 'I feel deeply grieved at the condition of your father, yet I cannot possibly assist him, unless I place myself in a worse state  than he is himself.' "Tormented at the thought of returning home with such sad news, to dispel the little hope its inmates entertained, and clung to like the drowning man to a straw, I strolled out into the crowded streets of the city. I thought to cool my throbbing temples and drown my sorrows in the multi-  plicity of new and strange scenes they would present, for the first time in my life, to my view. Who has not, when his mind was weary and perplexed, strolled forth, either amid the bustle of a large city, or the solitude of nature, to calm or dispel the thoughts that troubled him? It is the struggle of the body to distract the attention of the mind; to throw off from it a demon that bears like an incubus upon it, that eats into life itself. "For hours, almost in a state of unconsciousness, I wandered along the hard pavements in the vain search of something to dispel the anxiety and sorrow that harrassed my mind. I scarcely heeded the busy crowds which pushed by me, each one, like myself, perhaps, laden, though less heavily, with something on the mind. I scarcely noted the carriages that rolled by, with their glistening axles, soft   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     69 couches, and splendid steeds. I noted not the row of stately houses on each side, some covered with large let- ters, and with large awnings in front. Even as Isauntered along the wharf, I scarcely noted the ships, with their taper masts, sails furled, their flags flying, erablazoned with the emblems of most civilized nations. Heedlessly, almost  rudely, I pushed forward. At last, wearied  almost to fainting, I drew near a crowd of people collected around an auctioneer, who, with hammer in hand, and loud, expos- tulating voice, was vending his wares. Unconcernedly advancing into their midst, I seated nyself on a box of goods and began to interest myself in the scenes around me. "' How much for this valuable watch?' exclaimed the auctioneer, as He held aloft a large, uncouth looking thing, in the shape of the article he named. 'True, gentlemen,  he continued, after looking about him and seeing the smile the production of such an article occasioned, ' true, gentle- , men, it's rather an antiquated  watch; I dare say it has seen much service in its day. But w hat of that? Agfe is honorable: honor it, then, with a  respectable bid. It's been on hand this half-dozen years: came here,  heaven knows how;   but it matters not it must now besold. To b  e sule, gentlem en, it's not  running,' continued the auc- ti oneer, in t deprecating voice, 'but I dare say it would run, if fixed. What's offered? Come! start it at some- thing, if it's only ten dollars : the silver in it alone is worth that price. I  dare say, when this old watch was new , it  cost but little less than  fifty dollars. Now who'll give me fiftcell,' said one of the bystanders, 'I'l start it at fi fty cents.' "' Wheugh!   fiddlesticks! fifty cents! I'll give three tim es tha t amount myself, if only to have it coined into     70    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  money. One dollar and fifty cents are offered. This is a great bargain for somebody. One dollar and fifty cents!  Seventy cents! One dollar and seventy cents! One dol- lar and seventy cents is the money bid! Going for one dollar and seventy cents, without more money! Going!  m going! go-o--ing! It's a shame, gentlemen, to sacrifice this valuable property!.' "' Two dollars!' was my involuntary exclamation. "A thousand time since have I wondered what caused  A me to bid for that antiquated, cumbrous watch, when, at the same time, I had on my person a valuable gold one. It seemed that I did it mechanically ; that my tongue uttered the word without any prompting from my mind. "' Two dollars are offered!' continued the crier ; ' thank you, sir. Two dollars ; and going to be sacrificed, without more money. All gone? Going at two dollars! going! going! go-ing! gone! Whose is it?' "' William Aikeh.' "' Here's your watch, Mr. Aiken,' said the auctioneer, reaching it to me, with a half smile on his countenance. I handed him the money, and received the watch, while I heard a suppressed titter among the bystanders. I stuffed it into my pocket, and made my way out of the crowd, and my own embarrassed situation, and that of my family, coming up to my mind again, I thlought nothing more of the matter until late that evening, when I was about retir- ing to bed at my uncle's house, when I chanced to think of it. I drew it forth, while a blush of shame overspread my countenance, for being such a fool as to buy such a useless article, at a time, too, when I most needed money. But how can I express my astonishment, when I opened it with the point of my knife ; for I found that it had been sealed tight with wax! Many times, sir, and in many ways, have my feelings been worked upon.

The connection between sense, perception, n nd-" "Spare my feelings, Major," I interrupted; c it would afford me pleasure, and instruction, too, to listen to your disquisition at another time; but I am  on the rack to know the contents of the watch." "Well, then, sir, I ask pardon for the digression. Ima- gine my surprise and joy, on opening it to find the case filled, not as I anticipated, with the quaint, old-fashioned, and dingy wheels of a time-piece made in the dark ages, but with-" "Ugh! ugh! white man    talk-no watch-look out. U-g-h!" muttered a voice in our ear, which appeared to come from  the bushes close in our rear; but before we could turn our heads in the direction of the sound the sharp report of a rifle rang out on the stillness of the night. At the same  moment we were almost deafened by the most fearful screams; and ere we could turn in the direction, a huge panther fell struggling at our feet. At the same instant a tomahawk whizzed past us, striking the prostrate animal, and bounding off to one side. We looked round; and a  tall brawny Indian strode past us, and buried the glittering knife he clutched in his hand into the very heart of the beast; then drawing it forth, dripping with the blood, he coolly wiped it across the gray hide of the fero- cious animal; and turning, stood in our presence, with as calm and unruffled a brow as if nothing at all had happened. To say that I  was not astonished at these proceedings would be to give myself more credit for firmness than  a      72    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. youth of my experience ought to take upon himself. But the Major was as unconcerned as he ever was in his life. He coolly rose from the log upon which he had been sitting, and stepping to the Indian, exclaimed, "Give us your hand, my red friend! Why, old Sachem, you might as well let the ' varmint' devour us, as to frighten  us to death. Come, Aaron, boy, give him a hearty shake I of the hand, for he has done us a good turn; by Jupiter, he has!" turning the huge beast with his foot. By dint of inquiry we learned from the dusky savage that the panther was in the act of making a spring at us from the thick branches of the underwood that grew close i to our encampment, when he fired. On being asked what he was doing roaming through the woods at that time of night, he replied, in his broken language, "' Me hunt-white man work; me watch-white man sleep: me no more talk-white man talk-me listen!"  Finding no more could be got out .of him, the Major set i him a plentiful supply of provisions, and after inviting him to eat heartily thereof, he seated himself as before, and resumed his narrative.                 i iS 2(   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     73 I     FIFTHE NHET. a,& .

Was i  that your oyster, which you with sword did open?' "Umph! well, you did not miss it far, my boy," replied he; "the watch apparently was in the usual form, but the glass was concealed, or I thought so, by its having a two- fold case, like a hunter's watch. On opening the case I found it filled with diamonds, emeralds, and pearls, of enor- mous value, instead ofthe worksof a watch. They seemed to be all well preserved; the case had been made completely air-tight. The blaze of light that shot forth from the case when I  opened it was absolutely dazzling. For a moment I  was completely blinded; and I at first imagined that I had been made the victim of some trick. On more  closely  examining the contents of the case I changed my opinion, and the truth flashed upon my mind, almost stunning me. "On' taking out the contents of the case I found a slip of yellow paper in the bottom, on which was written, in a quaint hand-writing, the following lines:      *4    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.  You ma     y imagine y feelings on making this pleasing  the sadone     e    affairs of my belove d pare nt. I "' You may imagine my feelings on making this pleasing j discovery, doubly gratifying to me at this time, as I w s laboring under the deepest anguish of mind on account of  the sad condition of the affairs of my beloved parent. I carefully replaced the precious treasure back in the case, ! and retired to bed, but not to sleep. I thought of the joy I would create in my father's house on my return,.and of the affectionate hearts I would make glad by the intelli- gence. "For hours I reclined on my couch in the most pleasing j reveries, until the old city clock from St. Mary's steeple sounded the hour of midnight. One, two, three, passed by, and still the waking dreams of fancy passed, untilworn out by these delightful reveries, I fell asleep, and woke not till the sun was far out on his daily round. Springing from bed, I hastily concluded my toilet, repaired to my uncle's chamber, and related to him my strange fortune. Most heartily did he congratulate me, telling me they were pure diamonds and worth many thousand dollars;. and advised me, moreover, to take them to New York, as they would bear a much better price there. "I immediately adopted his plan, and having but little preparation to make, before noon was under weigh, and standing out from the harbor. A favorable breeze-sprang up, and in a short time the wharf, with its masts, the com- pact line of warehouses, the city, with its turrets, domes,   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     75 towers, and steeples faded from the view: we were out on the blue expanse of ocean, on our voyage to the 'Island city.' "The passage was accomplished without any incident worthy of note. Suffice it, I arrived at my destination in less than a fortnight. The day after my arrival I repaired to the shops of the principal jewelers of the city, and finally disposed of them to A. T. Stewart & Co. for $40,000; a sum far exceeding my most extravagant expec- tations. "After tarrying a day or two in the city I embarked on the brig ' Simon Hancock,' on my return home. Our voy- age was prosperous and pleasant at first; our light, grace- ful ship skimmed over the waters as though she disdained to touch them. On the sixth day of our progress out, however, dark clouds began to lower up all around, and ere the sun had dipped his fiery disc in the western waves, one dark mass covered the heavens." The winds soon arose to a storm, and blew and raged around our tossing vessel most fearfully. Although on the instant every stitch of canvass had been furled by the prompt orders of the cap- tain, yet the brig, driven by the gale, swept across the ocean with the speed of an arrow. ' Our captain, a brave and hardy seaman, ordered the crew all to their duty; but alas! no earthly power could govern the vessel. She was driven wildly about at the mercy of the winds, which seemed to take delight in toss- ing her upon the waves like a plaything. Her timbers groaned; her cordage creaked; her masts bent to the fury of the storm. All was disorder upon deck. Though the crew remained firm, yet the passengers ran wildly about, crying aloud for mercy. In vain did the captain bid them not to paralyze the spirits of his men by their conduct;  but it was of no avail. - -- -r -      -             \     "' To work! to work!' shouted the chief mate, a brave, *tive youth, ' there is already ten inches of water in the id.' -The pumps were plied diligently; but the danger as but little lessened. The storm raged without mercy,  ? ad with unabated fury. The ship reeled to and fro like a runken man. The waters hugged close around her, cast-  ! lg their spray on her sides, and dashing huge waves across  he deck, sweeping all the loose articles away, and to our Lorror, two of our fellow-passengers. We heard their fee- ale cry for help amid the hoarse voice of the tempest. lopes were cast out to them, but they were of no avail.  ohey perished; and as the fearful intelligence passed  tround, the brave set themselves to meet the same fate, and the timorous cried still louder for mercy. ," Amid this fearful scene we were startled by the excla- ; mation of the man at the mast-head:     . "' Land ho ! land ho!' "' Whereaway?' shouted the skipper. "' Broad here on our starboard beam.' '"Bout ship! All hands to their duty!' shouted the  i officers. "In vain was the effort made: the ship refused to obey  the helm; and again the ill-omened voice of the lookout cried, ' breakers ahead!' "At this moment a keen flash of lighthing lit up the scene, and we beheld the sea around us a dark mass of X raging waters, foaming and hissing with tremendous fury, and making a noise louder far than the scream of a thou- sand steam-whistles. At the same time we could see at the distance of a quarter of a mile the dark line of the coast. -Scarcely had we made these observations, when the ship struck, and remained fastened between the rgcks. In a second we were deluged with water. Wave after X wave rolled over the deck with fearful rapidity. Nothing    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     " could now be done to save the ship. Our only hope lay in the boats, to which the crew and passengers flew in the greatest' confusion. Among the rest, I rushed on deck. Here was all confusion: women shrieking for their hus- bands; children crying for their parents; and the helpless and timid shouting to those next to them to 4 save me! save me, for God's sake!' Such a scene of anguish, and horror, and misery I have never, in the course of an event- ful life, beheld since. Each seemed bent on his own pre- servation. Self was predominant: for it was a matter of life or death. The boats were crowded, and filled to over- flowing. All seemed to have escaped the ill-fated vessel. But just as the oars were raised to push off, a fine-looking elderly gentleman made his appearance on deck, accompa- nied by a beautiful young lady, and in the most frantic manner implored us to take them in. But the boats were already crowded, and borne down to the water's edge. "' God help you, for I cannot!' cried the captain, in despairing tones. "On the instant all feeling of self-preservation left me, and I cried out, "' I old! hold! I'll give them my seat. If you be men, stay, if only for a moment!' "With a desperate effort I sprang up the sides of the vessel and reached the deck. I seized the young lady, but  : she clung tightly to a rope. I implored her to make haste; she replied not, but pointed to the old man. Gathering all my strength I seized him, and with a desperate effort threw him over into the boat, where he was caught by the crew and placed in the seat I vacated. I then flew and gathered I the lady in my arms; but when I returned, the waves had forcibly borne the life-boat from the side of the vessel, and it was now several rods distant. Imagine my feelings at this awful crisis! Forsaken-left to perish on this frantic 7*     8   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. ,aste of waters, with no human being near, save the frail ower I supported inmy arms. And, although death stared s in the face; although I expected every moment to be ur last, yet, be assured, it was the proudest moment of my [ife. I had been the saviour of the life of the parent of ;he fair girl before me. He who has felt his heart thrill  at the accomplishment of a noble, a heroic, self-sacrificing deed, can understand my feelings in that moment. When I conceived the idea of saving this helpless pair, I stopped not to count the cost, the chances, or the probabilities. It was the first impulse of the heart I obeyed. I was young then, full of life, and ruled by impulse, as you are now. And let the words of an old man, experienced in the ways of the world, well read in the emotions of the heart, leave a full impress on your mind. Obey your youthful impulses;  stop not to count the cost, or to calculate probabilities; and if your feelings tell you that your design is noble, do it. Stop not to reflect. Though you may suffer for a moment; though you may run the risk bf shipwreck, as I did, or worse; yet in after life you can look back to such scenes and such actions with pleasure: and this is true happiness. But I am digressing, and will go on. at With eyes beaming with gratitude, my companion on that tempest-tossed wreck, nestled close to my bosom, and with an overflowing heart poured out her thanks: and there, on that slippery deck, amid the hissing, and roar- ing, and howling of the elements, I felt the warm throb- bing, the quick pulsations of that heart which had prompted the faithful daughter to offer herself a willing sacrifice for the life of her father. What love, what devotion, was this! But still the storm continued, sweeping the ocean, and dashing the waves into mountain billows, with as much fearfulness as ever. "For long and weary hours we clung to a single rope,   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     79 while volumes of water swept over the deck and drenched us every moment. Now and then a flash of lightning would blaze across the heavens, revealing to our gaze the horrors that surrounded us. The ship seemed to be firmly fastened upon the rocks, and the dashing of the waves against her could not detach her from her position. As a huge billow would roll up against her, sweeping a flood of waters across her deck, she would groan, and writhe, and creak, threat- ening, to our quickened senses, to go to pieces every moment. Oh, what a wretched night was that! But why dwell longer upon this heart-rending picture? Let it suf- fice, that after a period which seemed years to us, the grey tints of morning appeared in the east, indicating the approach of day-the most welcome sight I ever beheld. The storm, too, began gradually to subside. The winds ceased their raging, the sharp glance of the lightning became fainter, and the thunder gave only an occasional growl far in the distance, as if retiring in disappointed anger to his den. "Ere long the sun made his appearance in the east, and, as we turned to hail the bright harbinger of day, a well- manned boat from off shore pushed up along-side the wreck, in which the maiden beheld her father; and with an excla- mation of joy she sank on her knees and offered up grate- ful thanks for his preservation. "We immediately embarked, taking with us our baggage, as we feared the wreck would go to' pieces ere the boat could return; for the sea was yet boisterous, and dashed     along the shore with but little abatement of its former     fury. "The meeting of the father and daughter was tender and impressive. Neither spoke a word, but silently embraced    ; each other, whilst tears of joy poured down the cheeks of the parent. Turning to me, the old man pressed my hand,     80    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. but could only utter, in hoarse tones, almost suffocated with emotion, ' I thank you, sir; from the depth of a grate- ful heart, I thank you.' "1 We learned that the crew and passengers had landed safely the night previous. In half an hour's time we found ourselves standing on the beach, not far from Wilmington, North Carolina, to which place we immediately made pre.- parations to extend our journey. "The brig was in no condition to proceed farther on its voyage, and the captain gave it up as lost, but made what preparations he thought proper to secure the cargo on board. Whilst he was thus engaged, the passengers set out, some on foot, some on horses procured from the neigh- boring plantations, whilst others procured carriages. -"For the first time I understood that the old gentleman I had rescued from the brig was a man of great wealth and character in North Carolina. He introduced himself to me as ' Hugh Graham, of Wilmington.' I afterwards ascer- tained that he was Judge of the Superior Court, for the Eastern Circuit. His daughter, Jenny Graham, was just on her return from Washington Seminary, Pennsylvania, where she had been to complete her education. '.' On reaching Wilmington, Judge Graham and his accomplished daughter urged me most pressingly to take up my quarters at their residence during the time I remained. The gentle lady urged me, not by words, but in that more forcible manner, the language of the eyes. I accepted the invitation, for how could I refuse? and agreed to call at ' Selma,' the place of their residence; a beautiful spot, tastefully ornamented, just on the verge of the city. That evening I wished to replenish my wardrobe before making my appearance in company, for my clothes were soiled, and in a very sad plight indeed. But I was not blessed with the privilege of paying the Judge a visit, as a ship vas   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    81 about starting for Charleston, End the only one that would leave for that port in ten or twelve days. You may imagine the anxiety I had to be at home, and communicate the good fortune that had befallen me; and although I longed to fulfil the invitation I had accepted, yet a higher motive urged me to deny myself that pleasure. So I merely sent up my compliments to the lady, and a note of explanation to the Judge, stating my necessity to get home, etc., etc. Before another hour I was again on the treacherous ocean, though under far more favorable circumstances than when I last quitted it. "I shall pass over my return, for it was without any remarkable incident. "A week after my departure from Wilmington I found myself riding into the little village on the outskirts of my father's plantation. This was the county site, and from the number of people I saw thronging its otherwise deserted streets, I conjectured that something unusual was going forward. I rode along, and entered the public square with feelings of heartfelt gratitude and pride, although at the exact moment I entered it I heard the voice of the sherif, as he passed up and down before the court house, crying, with a loud voice: ' O yes! o yes! be it known to the public that I will offer at public sale, this day, at the resi- dence of John Aiken, all the right, title, and claim that he has in and to the valuable tract of land on which he, the said Aiken, now resides; also the personal property of every description, consisting of household and kitchen fur- niture, slaves, horses, hogs, mules, and other property; to satisfy a judgment and costs against the said Aiken, in favor of the President and Directors of the Bank of Cape Fear' ' "Under other circumstances this would have been an appalling scene to me; but as I had the ' wherewithal in !ai -                         ' I ,.S     OO2   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. my fob' to satisfy every demand, I passed on with a light and buoyant heart. I cantered up the old oak avenue, inwardly congratulating the sturdy trees that lined it, and which had stood there for ages, on their not being doomed to pass into the hands of strangers. "Hastening on, I dismounted at the door of my father's house, and found all in uproar and confusion. The negroes were collected together in little squads in the yard, loudly lamenting at their expected separation. So deeply were they affected, each one with his own private griefs, that no one noticed me as I passed hurriedly by them. I could even hear old Cesar, as we called an old slave who had been in the family time out of mind, harranguing a knot of his ' brudren,' as they gathered around him. ' Cuss de ole Bank!' he exclaimed, in his rough style. 'Golly whillik- ers! who is he dat dar come up here an' sell out ole massa? Jes' let ole Caesar hab 'im by de froat an' he'll wring 'im ewus dan he wring ole rooster!' "I heard no more, save the shout of defiance with which X this speech was greeted by the sable auditory. fi "I hastened into the house, where I found my father much distressed, not only on account of his difficulties, but on account of my protracted absence; for so much rejoiced had I been at my good fortune, that I neglected writing to my father and advising him of my movements. "The family all gathered round me, to whom I soon- explained all the incidents and transactions of my journey. You cannot imagine their surprise. My father, with excla- mations of joy, grasped me warmly by the hand and audi- bly breathed a short prayer to Heaven. My mother, forget- ting herself in her exstacy, stroked and patted my cheeks, as was her wont when I was but an urchin and dangled from her knee. 'My brothers and sisters kissed me again and again; and when it was known to the domestics in the   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     83 yard, such a shout as they gave would have done credit to a fourth of July meeting, and came rushing pel-mel around me, each one expressing his satisfaction in his own peculiar way; after which my father sent them out to have a holi- day, and make merry over the good fortune which' had befallen both them and us. And indeed that was a happy day in my father's house; for be assured, my dear sir, the talents of the sheriff were not put in requisition that day." "But, Major, what became of Miss Graham, her of ship- wreck memory?"I ventured to inquire, after he had fin- ished his story, and was now leaning on his hand in a musing attitude. Oh! aye, ' thereby hangs a tale,' which I will be happy to 'unfold' at some more seasonable hour. The evening wanes, and I fear the patience of .our red friend is already  wearied, as he understands but a moiety of our language."  'We looked round, but he was already gone: so we heaped up the fire, spread down our blankets, and were soon in the land of Nod.     SIXTH NIGHTO THE FIGHT. -NEXT morning, when I awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, pouring down from his lofty eminence his golden rays, which penetrated the forest here and there, and mingled with the mellow hues of the autumn leaves. Yet it was cheering withal, despite the sober and saddening hues of the fading leaf; his rays were like the smiles of a sunny face. They diffused warmth and comfort to all around. A few birds still lingered in .the trees to carrol the requiem of the faded verdure of the forest; the squir- rel appeared, on the almost bared branches, more shyly than was his wont, and on the least alarm scampered, with active leaps, to his hole in the old oak tree, to eat his corn and hickory-nuts in security. The night had been cool, and even in that temperate climate, here and there, a few sparkles of white frost might be seen, shining like diamonds wantonly scattered over the sear leaves of the forest. On looking around, I found that the vigilant Major, all unmindful of these beauties of nature which I have here described, had been up some time, and was, at a little distance, busily preparing breakfast, whist- ling now and then, and anon breaking forth into some favo- rite song. "Holloa, Major!"I exclaimed, lifting my head from my sad-dle pillow and propping- myself on my elbows,    "whoever heard of a man singing a song before breakfast? Don't you recollect the old saying, 'He who sings befo re breakfast will cry before night?' "  "O, there you are! You'lre up, are you, and growling like a skinflint of a husband at his spouse for not putting on the tea-kettle for breakfast the night previous, hey? (Intended for boys only, mere children, to keep them quiet in their cradles till 'their mam'-has their bread and milk ready.) By Jupiter! man, d&you think I can keep from singing on such a fine morning as this, when nature seems to awake from the lethargy of autumn and be cheerful again, like spring-time and summer? See how ligltly the winds wave the leafless branches; how the squirrels in the distance bark an chatter to one another; and how even this venison I'm broiling fpr breakfast frizzes and hisses, and, I verily believe, tries to strike. up 'Jim Crow' and  dance out of the frying-pan "  "The fire, you mean, Major." "I Well, have it so! Anyhow, it sends up a pleasant lit- le song which tickles both my ears and my nasal organs; low, in view of all this, can I help from striking up the une myself?" "But the song, Major, the song!  Let's have it at all vents. I  would fain know the tenor of your meditations n  such a lovely morning as this. Surely, it would inspire ou with something  ' grand, gloomy, and peculiar.'"  Yea, 'peculiar' enough; but as to being grand, I'l  one of that; gloomy you may call it, if it suit you.

The Major's song sounded out musically on the calm morning air, and I could not help maintaining a short  silence when he had concluded. He sat drumming his stout fingers on the old log, and with his eyes fixed on vacancy, as though he were contemplating the picture his song had suggested to his mind. I thought it improper to disturb his meditations, and so I left him to his study. I  After a while he roused himself, and exclaimed-- ' Wake up! wake up! this will never do? A home in the world, not a cot by the sea, is the better motto for my spirit." "Well  but, Major," I replied, "  you do not think of roaming about through the world even down to old age. Surely, there is a time for rest, without going down to the grave to seek it . "Perhaps you are right, my boy," the Major answered   : after musing a short space; " perhaps you are right. I have sometimes thought of such things; but the thought, like an April cloud, soon passes from my mind. I confess this season, with its fading glory, of late years renders me more melancholy than usual. I look out at the yellow leaf and mark it as it is gently disengaged from its spray, and how unobserved and unheeded it whispers to the ground and moulders with its mates; then I reflect that I, too, like that frail leaf, shall pass away and be no more. Such feelings, however, are soon dissipated, when, in the forest shades, I pursue the deer, or, with many a wile, surprise the wild turkey. Life returns to me again, and the melancholy vapors of the mind disappear. But is not this rather a peculiar confabulation at this time of day, and on such a                 .        ...i     3    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. bright morning? Melancholy, isnt it? So, let stir our- selves and make preparations to start upon our ining vay. We have a long distance to travel ere we come again to the abodes of civilization; and, from the uneasiness which you exhibited last night, you would prefer bed-posts and a pillow to the leaves of the forest and a saddle to sleep to, Why, Major, I never slept better in my life. And as to uneasiness-- ' Tut, tut! never mind, my boy, you'll ma e a soldier yet," interrupted the Major. ' Gear up your Dapple whilst I saddle up Rosinante, and let's set out in search of adventures       so   at YOU Agreed again, Major; so hes at youte In half an hour we lad ed up our baggag, mounte d our good steeds, and were once more on the road, the Major pushing on at a brisk trot and I following at his side. The woods, for some distance, were d ult to pass through, and had I been by myself I would most assuredly have lost the way; but the Major seemed fiiliar with the country, and went forward without hesitation. Now and then oue would come to piles of brush and huge logs strewn over our way, but our nimble steeds would spring over these obstruc- tions and push vigorously onward. Partridges, in large focks, would rise before us, and whirr through the woods in all directions, settling here and there upon the branches of the trees, or flying to other coverts in the thick, tangled undergrowth. Squirrels innumerable leaped ofom tree to tree, but did not seem to be much afraid of the intruders upon their forest wilds, but would sit upon some limb and chatter, or turn their acorn in their paws and nibble at their morning meal as though we were nothing unusual to them irrel tat Once the Major, provoked at an old gray squirrel that    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS. 8    9  sat barking on the branch of a limb just in our path, and not twenty feet from the ground, drew forth a pistol from his holster, muttering that he would " stop his chattering for him," took aim at the little fellow and fired. The ball took no effect upon him; but, instantly dropping a nut he held in his paws, he scampered off with all the agility he was master of; nor did he stop leaping from tree to tree until he reached a hole some two hundred yards froom the spot from whence he started. As the report died away xn  distant echoes through the forest, the Major returned his pistol to its holster, remarking, at the same time, "I would not kill the little bushy-tailed rascal for any- thing, but I like to frighten these animals; they know not the fear of man, and I like to see them scamper away as that little fellow did just now. See how they are all on the alert; in a moment more they will be barking and eat- ing away as usual." 1 We now approached a spur of the mountains on our right. I could see, through the almost leafless forest, the blue line of their summits stretching away in the distance and jutting their rugged peaks into the clouds. Inclining to the left, we passed down a valley watered by a dashing mountain stream of clear, sparkling water. The stream was easily forded, and we passed over it in several places as it wound around through the mountains, like a skillful general retreating, by stratagem, from the vicinity of a superior enemy. Whilst passing the stream the second time, the quick eye of the Major caught sight of a large buck that had come to the stream to-drink, at the distance of a. quarter of a mile above us. "By Jupiter!" he exclaimed, using his favorite excla- mation, "this will never do! Shall we let such a fine chance as this pass without trying to replenish our larder  8* ;! -i     90    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. with a round of choice venison? Flesh and blood can't stand it." Saying which, the Major laid his hand upon my horse's mane, and desired me to return to the bank and pass up the stream, on the side we had just left, for the distance of half a mile, saying that he would go across and seek a covert and await the coming of the buck, as it assuredly ! would pass down the stream when alarmed from a point above him. On the bank to which we were crossing, and on which the buck stood, was a rather dense growth of underwood for the space of about fifty yards from the edge of the water; but in the rear the mountain rose almost perpendicular and inaccessible to the steps of both man and beast. The progress of the deer was, therefore, impeded in the direction of the interior, and he would be compelled to pass along this strip on the river bank, where the Major had placed himself to intercept his progress. It is true he ! had no weapons save a pair of large pistols, made in that heavy and almost awkward style in vogue in the days of the Roundheads and Cavaliers of "Merry England;" yet at the distance of twenty paces the Major boasted that he could drive the centre of a " pine-tree shilling," a coin now rarely seen save in museums and collections of coins. I departed on my scouting expedition, taking care to retreat from the river a sufficient distance to insure the , non-disturbance of the deer by my movements until I had  reached the proper point on the river above him. The   * n wind was favorable to the success of our stratagem; the  a cool breeze floated down the stream, so that no scent borne I upon it could be detected by the sharp organs of the animal o whose destruction we were plotting. I carefully guided   aq my nimble steed through the thick mazes of the forest, and A Lad reached a point about opposite the position of the buck, hb when a rise of ground brought me into a situation from  st(   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS. which I could trace the windings of the stream above and below me for the distance of at least a mile. Dismounting from my horse, and fastening him to the limb of a tree close at hand, I cautiously emerged from the forest and passed out on the open knoll before me. I could trace the wind- ngs of the rapid stream to a point above me, where a sud den projection of the mountain hid it from my view. The noise of the dashing waters sounded pleasantly upon my ears, and I was perfectly charmed with the clear, silvery appearance of the waters as they glistened in the sunlight. Tracing the stream, with my   eye, along the opposite bank, I came to the point where we had beheld the buck, but he was there no longer. I  eagerly scanned the river- bank and srained my gaze into the forest which lined it, to catch even a glimpse of the object of my search, but all in vain. I  was about preparing to leave the place to pass up the stream a short distance and cross over, when a new objeet attracted my attention. Ay distance from the nearer bank was about  fifty yards, but it was only visible here and there through the openings in the undergrowth. As   I  glanced hastily through one of these openings, was sur- prised to see a small black dog running hither and thither as if on the scent of some animal.      co njectu red that some huiman being must be n ot far off. and I   eagerly glanced through the opening to d iscover, if possible, his p resence. I did not look in vain ; for behind  :  huge tree, on the very bank of the stream, I discovered , hunter with a rifle carelessly thrown over his le ft arm.  l  e seemed to b e in tently gazing upon th e o pposit e b ank 'i lide the thick branches t hat seemed to intercept his view.   i ftcr carefully viewing the  opposite bank in this manner ,  -i 'gradually  withdre w hi s rifle, and , slo wly retreat ing a  ep o  r two, all the time keeping his eye fixed on the op po-  ! i i    'i     92  - AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.         I site shore, placed it to his shoulder, and glanced along the barrel. Presently a quick puff of blue smoke came from before his face, a stream of fire rushed from the barrel of his weapon, and the sharp rattle of the explosion rang out on the forest solitude, and died, in distant echoes, along the mountain-slopes on the opposite side of the river. "Whoop! hurrah for the Gineral!" shouted a voice; "that's the way to lick 'em. Told you so, Jep; Gineral never misses ;" at which the hunter patted the barrel of his rifle, and his dog scampered around him, yelping and barking with great delight. I thought it time to discover myself, as I doubted not but that he had fired at the very animal whose destruction I was at that moment plotting; and, from his chuckling, I doubted not but that his shot had taken effect. The appear- ance of the hunter, his frank manner, and joyousness, con- vinced me that there would be no evil consequences in mak- ing his acquaintance. But I was saved the trouble, for, to my astonishment, he turned round and shouted, "i Hillo, thar, stranger! kim along-doant be afeered; happy in your acquaintance," at the same time motioning towards me.  Bring on yer critter," he continued, seeing that I hesitated (a moment, aiJd glanced back to where I had fas- tened my horse. "How's yer?" he accosted me, as I came up to him, leading my horse; " how's yer?

No matter for that, though; shall have a slice out'n him. But it's the Gineral as did it, and is nothin' in conse- kence." Seeing me somewhat astonished at this latter piece of information, hle proceeded to explain- "This is the Gineral" said hle, tapping the barrel of his  -..--e ...'" *wean'1 ENTERTAINMENTS.  90 rifle with his powder-horn, with which he was about to reload; "I calls this ere shootin' iron the Gineral, Gineral Jacson, in honor of that great man and monstrous Injun fighter. And, in coorse, when I  p'int the Gineral at a buck, or a coon, or an Injun, it has to come; can't help it." "You've killed the deer, tlhen, my friend--tle deer which I was in pursuit of?"I inquired. "Yis, sir, is, beggin9 yer parding for spiling yer sport. But I couldn't help it. 'Twas agin natur to see the animal standin thar as if 'twas darin the Gineral; couldn't stand it, sir. Why, I do believe the Gineral himself would a fired at the impedent animal and killed it. I do!" he continued emphatically, seeing me smile as if in doubt of this last assertion; t I do! drat my skin if I don't! Why, I'll tell you, stranger, ov a sarcoomstance as befell this ere Gineral. One day, bein' a leetle fat-i-gued in huntin' over them ar tarnal steep mountains, I sot myself down to rest on a log, 'with my back squared up agin a tree. Jep, mny dog, that you see thar, bein' also tired, follered my example; and it warn't but ten minutes, or thar abouts, until we were both asleep in the arms of Morpus, and dreaming on pleasant dreams. Wall, now, what d'ye think, but a ravenous old she bar, taking advantage on our helpless situation, safely and owdaciously slips up to'rds us to make an evenin' meal on us!

Here, Jep ; come along pup." By this time my new companion had reloaded his rifle, and, calling his dog to him, took off his moccasins and pre- pared to cross the stream, which, in that place, was shallow enough to wade. I followed after him, and, as we passed over, I took a close observation of the hunter. He appeared to be a man who had numbered, perhaps, forty or forty-five years; stout, with a firm, bulky chest, about the middle size, and active in his movements. There was an expression of good humor and carelessness on his countenance, which was improved by the sly twinkle of two small dark eyes, which seemed to reflect the laughter of his face. His heavy, prominent cheek-bones would have given one the impression that he was of the raw-boned order ; but the good humor that continually appeared on his face materially concealed these characteristics. His forehead was neither remarkable for its height nor for its lowness; above it large masses of brownish hair clustered in great disorder, and with little regard to the latest cut fresh from city barbers. His dress was of the picturesque style. A pair of stout buckskin breeches, stitched together with thongs of deer-hide; waistcoat of the same material, and made- in the like rude fashion; with a cap stuck jauntily upon his head, manufactured of the skins of the red fox, with the head of that sly animal prominently set forth on three sides, made up the most important part of his dress. This stout-specimen of the hunter stepped, without hesi- tation, into the stream, carrying his rifle and moccasins under one arm, and picking up his little dog, "Jep," and bearing him under the other. We reached, without diffi.   AMERICAN NIGTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     95 culty, the other side, and, a few yards from te bank, we found the dead body of the deer. e seemed to have died almost instantly, for he lay, stretched at full length, with his head thrown back, near the spot where the hunter had fired at him. My companion eyed him with the attention of a connoisseur in such matters, feeling the plumpness of the flesh, inspecting the breadth of his rump and the prom- inenee of his breast with much alacrity. Appearing to be satisfied with his inspection, he steppedback a pace or two turning towards me, exclaimed, briefly, nodding his hlead at the same time--              h "By golly! he's a whopper! he'll do, he will!" "He appears to be a very fine buck indeed," I said. "Pray  , are you going to dress him upon the spot, or carry him to your home in his pIesent condition?" "Dress him ? Sartin. Here, bear a hand; let's have his hide off in no time. Ten minutes is my rigelar time for the job, but      minte T81 my rigelar time for thejob, but, with assistance, I take seven. Hist, pup! what's the matter now?"This last interrogitory was addressed to his dog, who was growling and showing his teeth in a very fierce manner. "Eh?" continued he, "be  sharp, Jep! lie low ; silence!"  Saying which, he stooped down and eagerly glanced  through the forest. It was no diicult matter to trace out any object at a short distance; but th e unevenness of the ground prevented the eye from scanning it to any great extent. The quick perceptions of the dog had detected the approach of some being, but whether human or not was not so easily decided. W e could hear the faint cracklin g of bushes, as if something approached us; but all uncer- tainty was soon put to rest by the ex  clamation of the  hu nter                 '. "Hilloa, there show your colors. Friend or foe?" d"F  r iend-friend, of course," answered a voice which I * )I     96    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. at once recognized as the Major's; "but, by Jupiter, not so much a friend, either, if this is the way you spoil a body's sport by killing the deer one's after," continued that individual, as he came plunging into our midst, and looked around upon the scene. "Down, Jep; be .silent, I say!" said the hunter in buckskin to his dog, who appeared to be vastly enraged at the appearance of another person in the scene. 'Why, stranger, couldn't help that, you know, seein' as how a body can't tell how many mought be arter the same animal. S'pose everybody was to stop and enquire who was arter this ere deer and that ere bar, how many of sich animals would he scalp afore night, d'ye think?" "Well, well," rejoined the Major, laughing, "I wont pretend to answer you; you're right enough. The beasts that roam these forests are free to every one. But how's this? You killed the deer from the opposite bank. That was an excellent shot, friend." "O! only a matter of eighty yards or so; that's nothin', 'specially when the Gineral's about: I call my shootin- iron the ' Gineral,' sir, as mayhap you don't know what I 'luded to. The Gineral's death on deer, 'specially plump, fat ones, like this one." 4"Ah, indeed!" replied the Major, taking up the "Gin- eral" from the place where the hunter had carefully depos- ited it before commencing to cut up his venison, and care- fully examining it; " ah, indeed! the ' Gineral' is really a discriminating rifle." "Yis, sir, yis, you may well say that. Let me inform you of a sarcoomstance as happened to me one day whilst searchin' the woods for squirrels and sich like game. Wall, arter lookin' 'bout for a considerable time, or, mayhap, a little shorter, I won't say, though, I spies, on the tip-top of a hickory saplin', a bushy-tail all coiled up in the leaves.   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.     97 Up goes the 'gineral,' when, what d'ye think, stranger, jist as I was drawing a bead upon the unconscious animal,   ! a fat coon poked his sly head out of an old tree beyant, l and drat my hide if the gineral didn't go off an' fotch the coon inste'd of the squirrel! Fact, sir, or my name ain't Peter Root." Saying which Mr. Root very complacently set himself to dress the carcass of the deer with the air of a man who has delivered the truth to his hearers with not the least expec- tation of its being doubted. "Well, Mr. Root," replied the Major, tapping his nose with the fore-finger of his right hand and giving a sly wink towards me, " well, Mr. Root, and what become of the squirrel? You missed it, of course." A Missed it? I missed it? The gineral missed it? No, sir, never! Bless your life, both were killed at the same blow and fell on the ground, kicked and tore about, and at last, both rolled up in the same heap and died beautifully, together, with their paws lovingly embracing one another and the bushy tail of the squirrel covering them both over decently, like a dead body afore a funiral." "That was surprising," gravely answered the Major, looking steadily at the hunter; " though they were sepa- rate in life, yet in death they were not divided." "Jist so; that's a fact, stranger, for, in less than an flour from that time I had 'ema both boilin' in a pot together. And didn't they make beautiful soup? Re-markably so." "The 'gineral' has seen some service," observed the Major, who had been examining that article of gunnery pretty closely, and now pointed at some parts of it where the stock seemed to have been shattered and which was mended by coiling wire around the barrel; " how's this, Pete? You have not been knocking the Indians over the head with it club fashion, have you?" 9     "Stranger," answered Pete, solemnly, raising up from his work and wiping the blood from his hunting-knife on a bunch of leaves, " stranger, it has slain Injuns, but it was in fair fight; no clubbin', no knockin's over the head, but by puttin' cold lead through the tarnal red-skins. No; that shatterment, as you see, happened otherways. I'll tell you the sarcoomstance. One day I was a huntin' foi deer along the banks of that bcautifulest of streams, the French Broad. I didn't carle much whether I killed any or not,' so I beat about through the woods, and kept a settin' down on the logs and listcnin' to the birds a singin' or lookin' at the river as it went sleepily on, in a purty dull manner. I had p'inted the gincral at a turkey, and arterwards, with- out loading, marcheld off with it slung over my back, for in coorse I killed it. Well, I was slowly scranmblin' througli the woods, thinkin' on niothin' particular and everything in gineral, when up bounces a huge stag, with a tall pair of horns, and faces about right before me. Quick as lightnin' the gineral was up to my shoulder, and jist as I was a goin' to pull the trigger and pick him right atwixt the eyes, I 'fiected that the gineral wasn't loaded. ]Eut, strangers," continued Pete, turning round and gravely addressing us both, "even in that orful moment my fortitude didn't for- sake me, and the gineral didn't fail me. For I was so excited that, drat me, if the lightnin' didn't blaze out of my right eye and whizzed along the barrel of the gineral and killed the deer slick; it never moved arterwards. But the lightnin' was too much for the gineral, seein' as how ihe wasn't much used to sich kind of shootin', and tlat's the way the stock was shattered; and I allers says that them's the honorablest scars any shootin' iron can carry." "You are right there, Pete," said the Major, in reply, ' you are right there. ]But you don't make a custom of killing deer with lightning, do you?"

"  ' With all my heart," said I, and we at once proceeded to take a parting glass, or stirrup cup, all around. Pete smacked his lips anld said to the Major, ' Gov'nor, you're the chap for me. Drat me! I do beeleve I would let you shoot the gineral off once or twice." Having replied to this sally, we took our leave, the hunter remaining  to take care of the carcass of the deer, whilst we plunged into the forest again, and, in a short time, were out of sight and hearing of our late acquaintance. In half an hour we were on the line of our journey, again, and, after chatting familiarly on the eccentricities of our late companion for some time, we both relapsed into Iill/     100    AMERICAN NIGtIS' ENTERTAINMENTS. silence. Presently we drew forth from our saddle-bags some remnants of cheese and other provender, with which we regailed ourselves as we rode along through the path- way of the forest. This finished, we again relapsed into silence, each one plunged in his own train of reflections. The Major now and then would speak to his horse, as though that animal was a human being and understood his language ; at other times he would hum some air, and would even break out into whistling some old favorite tune. All this he would do with an air of abstractedness, as though his thoughts were quite otherwise employed than in attend- ing to the scattered fragments of music which now and then were emitted from his lips. As for myself, I at first turned my attention to the vari- ous natural objects that met us in our progress. The mountains in the distance; the rushing of the precipitous streams; the magnificence of the surrounding prospects; the height of the sturdy forest trees, claimed each their share of admiration and attention. Now and then we would pass the clearing of some adventurous settler; and it was curious to trace the roughness of his improvements, the rude state of his cabin, and the wild character of the sur- rounding objects. Again we would arrive at the abodes of civilization and refinement. Beautiful farm-houses, exten- sive and well cultivated fields, good roads and pleasant meadows met our view. But, at length, the monotonous character of our journey wearied me, and I ceased to look upon the surrounding scenery with attention or interest. My mind turned inwardly, and I whiled away my time in a long train of reflections. My thoughts, for the first time since my departure, turned to my home, to my parents, to my brothers and sisters, to my friends and acquaintances. How would I have rejoiced to be back, even for a single hour, where all our purest, holiest feelings are horn and O^   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    101 nurtured, our griefs assuaged and our joys rendered more complete-to the home of my boyhood! Although I had been absent but a short time, the word home, as I whispered it to myself, sounded sweeter than the most delicious strains of music. It called back my childish feelingsf and earlier memories, and reminded me of all that I love by ties that are seldom felt except by such simple associations. There are moments in life when we become exceedingly low-spirited; when the heart becomes sad, and we grow debilitated both in body and mind, though at the same time the song, the jest and merry laughter are at their height. Just so it was with me. From the saddening reveries into   which I had been plunged I danced off, borne by the imn- petuous flow of youthful spirits, to a more congenial theme. - I pictured myself, in imagination, as being once more seated by the side of Ada, onl the neat piazza at her mother's residence; her bright eyes, downy cheeks and sylph-like form was once more before me. Her silvery voice rang once more in my ears; and, in drinking down the sweet Imusic, I could not but acknowledge to myself that it awoke a thrill in my heart. Was this the first feeling of love? and how, at that moment, did she regard me? Did she feel, towards me anything more than gratitude for the timely service I liad rendered? Did she think of me, and were her thoughts tender and true? What would I not have given to have known the true answers to these questions! "Wake up! wake up! Brown, I say!" halloed the lMajor, breaking in rather rudely upon my reverie and setting all my pleasing faincies to flight. "Dreaming about Ada, eh? Why, how you blush! I did not think you were so deep in love before." "But, Major, perhaps you are mistaken--- " "Tut! tut! nmistaken, indeed! I'm acquainted with such matters too well to be deceived. It's 1;o shame to love, sir 9*     -like you for it. I pity the man who cannot love; who is proof against woman's charms, against dark eyes swim- ming in their own ethereal essence, pouting lips, glossy ringlets, hands plump as a partridge, taper fingers and well rounded insteps. Indeed, sir, he is hardly deserving the nane of man who could stand exposed to flashing eyes, soft voices, winning smiles and kind speeches without receiving a wound; " O! bear him to some distant shore, Or solitary cell, Where nought but savage monsters roar- Where love ne'er deigned to dwell."' Discoursing thus lightly, we continued our journey till just as the shades of evening were falling around us, we came in front of an inn by the way-side, called the "Trav- eller's Rest," where we determined to spend the night. A few houses were clustered around this place, but everything betokened a new settlement, and, to all appearance, it was a thriving one. Nothing of interest occurred at this place; we were comfortably lodged and bountifully fed, and early the next morning we were on oufr refreshed steeds, ourselves refreshed, and briskly starting forward on our journey. We had not advanced more than ten miles when, from the numbers we saw riding in the same direction with our- selves, we judged that something of interest was going on among the people of the country. On inquiry we found that we were in what is now the Picken's District of South Carolina, and that it was Court day for that circuit in Greenville, their county town. We soon came in view of the place-a neat country village, beautifully situated, with pleasantly shaded streets and tastefully ornamented dwell- ing houses. On riding up to the "Bell Tavern," the only place of entertainment in the village, we found the front yard and porch crowded almost to suffocation by the citizens and   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    10 yeomanry of the country, who were engaged, at that particular moment, in listening to a speech from one of theirnumber. Engaged all were not; some were gathered in a   small circle, now and then taking a pull at a bottle which they circulated among themselves, all the time talk- ing in a most vociferous manner. Others were collected around some horses that were offered for sale by some I Kentucky horse-traders, and were chaffering their prices; here and there was a grave old gentleman, with spectacles, ! looking over the sheets of a newspaper, or reading some items of astonished'  news to those around; and a few were collected around the orator, who was mounted on an empty store box, with his hat in one hand and a bundle of papers i the other, and was laying down his arguments in a very emphatic manner. We reined in our horses on the out- skilrlt of this motley assembly, to make a few observations as to what vas going on before proceedingf further. And first we turnel our attention to the speaker. It appeared that he was discussing the  propriety of making a M acalldamnized road between Greenville and Colum- bia. He wished ----but I'l take down a part of his speech in his own  inimitable language, or as near it as I can, for the edification  of my hearers, for I could not possibly do him justice otherwise.

Why, fellow citizens you put me in mind of a long-tailed colt father used to have. He never changed his name of colt as long as he lived, and he was as old as the hills; and though he had the best of 'eatin', he was as thin as a greyhound. He was ' colt' all his days; always young, always poor; and young and poor, fellow citizens, I guess you'll be to the eend of life." Here the horse-jocky interrupted, and inquired, "Whar's that ere colt as you're talking about? I'll gin you a swap-bring him on!" "Go on, go on, cappen, never mind now! swap some other time! go on with your speech!" resounded from all sides at this interruption. In the midst of this confusion a travelling pedlar mount- ed the fence and was about to cry off some of his wares when the -fence broke down and stopped him. In the confusion that followed this accident, the orator again commenced, shouting at the top of his voice, "Rouse up yourselves, then, to do that which will promote your own interest. Yes, gentlemen," he continued, speaking so loud that his voice cracked; and, whilst he was righting himself again, all his further efforts at speech-making were drowned by the stentorian voice of a stout, rough-looking bully, who was standing right in front of us, and who had been closely examining the Major and myself for a short time; and, being apparently satisfied with his scrutiny, he bellowed, at the top of his voice,   e .t       h,-'rarey, NIGHTS INTRRTAINM;N;10 o oa, sptranger! where a   u f   ndigna,t the tone of voice he used, I     el "(From, Tennessee, sir."    , instantly replied This simple announcement had an electric effect upon him. lie Sprang up in the air, clapping his feet togethe r. then, jerking off his hat, he thre it iolen his feetly the " Whobdoff            on the ground and ger"Whoop! by tckee! you're my man!

I turned at the far side of the ring and awaited his further movements. In a second he was on his feet and scowled savagely around upon the crowd for laughing at his discomfiture. Making at me again, he dealt his blows so thick and fast that my only alternative was to dance round the ring and ward them off as best I could. I thought imy last hour had come, for every blow would have felled an ox. The bully became elated at his success and was not so wary as at first. Taking advantage of his care- lessness, I a second time tripped him up and turned at the other end of the ring and awaited as before, his further movements. But I waited in vain. As he fell, his head  struck a rock and lie rolled over upon the ground lifeless. One of his companions bent over him a moment and rising up, exclaimed, "By G--d, boys, he's killed him! to the gallows-tree with the assassin!" 'Down with him! cut him down!" cried they all. The greatest confusion and uproar ensued. I stood stupified, benulibed, speechless. The idea of being a murderer! It was awful! Mty stuli- faction had like to have been my death. One of his com- panions made at me with a huge club, and had it not been for the Major, I had certainly seen the last of earth.- Drawing his pistols and springing from his horse he jumped in front of me, felled the ruffian at a single blow, and cried "Aback! aback! you ruffians; you forced this fight upon my companion; it was none of his seeking ; the first villian that moves an inch, I'll shoot him down like a dog!' Several missels were thrown from the outskirts of the crowd, but those in front stood aloof, awed by the menacing attitude of the Major. At this moment some one cried out, "Billy Cassiday has come too, he's alive, he was only stunn'd or so!"This     108   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. diverted the crowd.. I rushed joyfully forward and assisted him to rise. He gazed steadily at me a moment'and broke out in a hearty laugh. "By G-d stranger, you put it to me this time. You're a brave lad, give us your hand!" At this happy termination of the affair, three rounds of applause went up from the whilom angry crowd, and we all adjourned to Butler's saloon, where we frolicked with the now jolly crowd for an hour or two, and then mounted our gallant steeds and set out on our jaunt. The whole popu- lation came out and gazed at us as we rode off; some taking us to be black-legs and gamblers, some thieves, and jugglers and a few (may I not in charity, say so) taking us to be much wronged and ill-treated travellers.   ;r       AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    109 ;j over the river like a gable pall.

We cantered up to the house, and, as we halted in-front of the door, twenty or thirty men, women and children, rushed to the door to see us, some of them exclaiming,-- 10     "O    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.  "Here he is! here he is! the new circuit rider's come at last; welcome, welcome!" and a dozen smiling faces peered into ours, and a dozen welcoming hands were ex- tended. He had been taken (as we learned afterwards) to be a new " circuit rider" that was to preach through this section of country, and whom they had been long expect- ing. An appointment had been made for him to preach at  the house in which we were all assembled, and the surround- ing neighborhood had turned out en masse on the evening of our arrival. When the Major had corrected this mistake they appeared to be not a little disappointed, for they had assembled early in the day, and were anxious for spiritual instruction. The good Major sympathized with them, so much so that  he informed them that if the preacher did not arrive by the time we finished our supper, he would address them  himself. "Do! do! brother," cried they all, crowding and shak- ing hands with him again. Supper was just then announced, and as we were led to an adjoining house, I inquired in astonishment.- "Why, Major, you don't mean to say that you're going to preach a sermon?" "And why not, why not? My aim is to do good where- ever I am. If I can do these good people a favor I'll do so cheerfully. I always, when traveling, try to adapt my manners and conveisation (always in gentlemanly bounds) to that of the company into which I fall; happy am I in doing so whenever I can do good." As we seated ourselves around the board, the landlady turned to me and asked me if I would have " sweetnin' in my coffee," and if so, whether I would take "long or short." "Long sweetning, madam, if you please," replied II   .   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    1" thinking she meant much or little-(I always like my coffee well sweetened) I eyed her closely, however, to learn her meaning of the terms " long and short." She reached up to a crack in the wall of the house and took down a gourd of honey, dipped her finger into it and then plunged it into my cup of coffee and began stirring it round and round. I was taken perfectly aback; but there were no spoons on the table, and but two knives, and those were in the possession of the Major and myself. The Major was too well-bred to laugh at my dilemma, but I saw by the twinkle of his eyes that I should hear of it again. Turning to the Major, she inquired, " long or short stranger?" "Short, madam, I always take short sweetning in my coffee, always!" replied the Major, pompously. She took up a huge lump of maple-sugar and bit off a mouthful and dropped it into his cup. The Major's dilem- ma was as bad as mine, so we came to an agreement for our mutual benefit to mention the circumstance to no one.- Having finished our supper we returned to the crowd assembled in the house. The preacher had not yet made his appearance, so the Major, at the general request of the company, proceeded to lead in the services. He drew from his portmanteau a hymn-book, and after a preliminary hem, gave out that beautiful song by Montgomery: "O! where shall rest be found, Rest for the weary soul?" The whole congregation joined in the song, and beauti- fully did the strains swell out on the evening air; more earnestness, ah! and zeal, and spirit, went out with the beautiful words, from those simple-minded people, than e'er ascended from 'neath the lofty dome and fluted columns of a city cathedral. The Major knelt, and in a deep, earnest impressive voice offered up a prayer to God. After which ---*  .c     "2    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. he- arose and addressed them at some length, taking his text from Proverbs: s"There are many ways which seemeth good unto man, but the end thereof is death." The Major spoke in a plain, forcible, eloquent manner, and was listened to with marked-attention. Many tears were shed, many an honest "Amen," and "God grant it," were echoed round the circle of hardy pioneers, as the Major expounded his text and pointed the way to God. He at last concluded his remarks, and with a profound bow he left the congregation at their devotions, which they continued by praying and singing till far into the small hours of the night. WAe repaired to our own room, and having seated our- selves on either side of a blazing fire, lit our cigars and cracked a few jokes. The Major, at my solicitation, gave a willing consent to finish his promised narrative relative to Miss Graham. ' Most willingly, boy, will I do so; for now of all things I love to dwell on the past. At your age I ever looked forward to the future; but now, when my face is beginning to be furrowed, when my hair is beginning to be silvered, and my form losing its wonted strength, I look back to the past, to my hopes and fears, joys and sorrows. Not that I wish to live over them again in reality, yet their remem- brance brings me happiness. It is bliss to feel the joys, the hopes, the fears of youth; they lighten our present cares and soothe our passing infirmities. Thus you see in retrospect, memory usurps the place of hope; our aspira- tions as we grow old become chilled; joyfully, then, we seek a remedy in the past, for we become young again, the pulse becomes strong, and the heart beats high as was its wont ere we came in contact with the cold, pitiless, calcu- lating world. But to the point. "After the pleasing emotions and joyful excitement   ;gf -;    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     113 II ,2 -experienced on relieving my father of his pecuniary embar- rassment had somewhat subsided, my thoughts gradually and instinctively turned and centered on the fair being I rescued on the wreck of the brig Simon Hancock. Indeed thoughts of her ever reigned prominent in my mind; she was the sole idea, the cynosure of my heart; all that my life had of promise was connected with her memory. "A half year had now passed, but without bringing any change to my feelings. My yearnings became finally so great that I resolved to go to Wilmington, or even to the ends of the earth in search of the fair destroyer of my peace. I resolved to go and unveil my feelings, pour out the yearnings of my heart, to woo and win her if possible. Accordingly I made a few preparations and set out for Wilmington. On my arrival I found that she had gone in company with her father, some six weeks previous, to the city of New York, where they expected to remain during the winter. Not feeling inclined to give up the search, I accordingly set out for that great mart, firmly resolved, in the pertinent language of Francis Marion, of happy mem- ory, to ' do or die.' "While at Wilmington, I had neglected to get Judge Graham's address at New York, so on my arrival I was at a very great loss to find them in so large and populous a city. Day after day I threaded the streets and public places of amusement, and night after night I attended the theatres and operas without finding or gaining the least clue of them. I was returning slowly back to my hotel on the evening of the fourth day of my arrival, from a ramble in one of the parks in the environs of the city, disappointed enough at my bad success, when' familiar voice hard by accosted me. '6 Hallo, there! is that you, Aiken? It is, it is, by the life!' 10*     "1 I turned and clasped the hand of Tom Hartmus, one of my best friends, whom I had not seen for many a long year. H"'Happy to welcome you to our fair city; been here nearly a week, eh ? Sorry I did'nt know it. But where have you just returned from now ? You go sauntering along like one in a trance, with your eyes on the pavement and not deigning to cast one curious or admiring glance at the noble tenements on either hand, or the dashing turn- outs between. From the park, eh ? strolling all alone,- well, I'll e'en make amends for lost time. I'm just on my way home to dress and prepare for the grand masquerade ball at Mrs. Johnston's to-night; and you, Aiken, shall 'accompany me. The gentlemen alone are to go masked and to personate different characters. The ladies are to attend in their ordinary costumes, with no other covering to their pretty faces than rouge, and the manifold paints with which they are accustomed to besmear their downy cheeks.' "' But, my dear Hartmus, you know,-' "' Not a word, not a word; no breach of etiquette-we don't stand on fashion here; and, besides, I'm a fortieth cousin to the hostess-so no more objections.' " But where will I get a costume ? I havn't time to get one made.' " I No fear on that score ; I have one already prepared that will fit you exactly. I intended to personate a monk and ordered a dress accordingly, but it was made too large, so you see I will have to personate the fool in some other garb. Come along, you will be amused.' " ' Will there be many ladies ?' I inquired. ' Numbers, my dear fellow, as fair, as sweet, as lovely as heart could wish. I feel this to be so, though at the expense of my own heart; for there is one in particular,   alUllV;aN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    115 Aiken, a southern lass she is, that outshines all the rest;  she is the acknowledged belle of the city. Many offers of marriage has she had since a sojourner here; many hearts and fortunes has she rejected, though in a kind and courte- ous manner; and the rejected, though they leave her sorely disappointed, yet not with anger, more in love than ever. Many deem her a coquette, others again think her already engaged to some southern laddie, oh-but here we are at my rooms.' "An hour after the above conversation we entered a splendid mansion on broadway, each of us dressed uncouthly enough. The one personating a monk with his cowl and hood, the other an Indian chief with his belt of wampum and plume. It must be confessed I felt not a little embar- rassed when the wide folding doors were thrown open and the servant announced,--'His Excelleny, L   Ross, s xellency, Lewis Ross, chief of the Cherokees, and Father McNabb.' "The rooms were already filled to overflowing. Crowded by hundreds of personages in all the varied costumes of an eastern fair, or carnival. The Jew, the Turk, the Indian,  the Highland Scotchman, and scores of others were per-  sonated. Besides these a hundred beautiful ladies were-  there; lovely, indeed, with eyes far brighter than th  sparkling diamonds they wore, and sunny faces brighter  than the bright lights pouring from the magnificent lamps and chandeliers ; sounds of sweet soul-stirring music ming- led with the voice of laughter, the song and the jest greeted  the ear. It was a ravishing and magnificent spectacle indeed! "'Permit me, Mrs. Jonhston" said Hartmus, leading me up to the hostess, a little, dry, cold-looking woman  most gorgeously dressed, 'permit me to make you acquainted with my most cherished friend, William Aiken, of South  i ... .

I was about to decline when Hartmus pulled me by the sleeve, saying, 'you shant decline; sing that quaint old song we learned to sing years ago, at Chapel Hill, commencing, "What an illigant life, &c." do, now, there are no Catholics here that would take offence,' and raising his voice he cried,- ", 'Silence! the company will give their attention to Father McNabb, of Belfast, ould Ireland, while he sings a bit o' a song.' In a moment the house was still, and as there was no other alternative, I began chanting in a full, strong voice, the following to the- AIR-St. Patrick was a Gentleman. "What an illegant life us friars lead With our cross and hood before us, We mutter our prayers and count our beads, And all the women adore us.

The devil, himself's, afraid, I wot, And dares not to deride us, For angels make each night our cot, And then-- lie down beside us," "As I concluded, roars of laughter burst out from all quarters of the room, such peals as, I vouch to say, were never heard by our kind hostess in her banqueting halls before. Under cover of the tumult and confusion, Hart- mus and myself beat a hasty retreat to the next room which we found filled also, but by a far less noisy company. "'Yonder, Aiken,' cried Hartmus, " sitting at the piano, is the fair southern lass, of which I was giving you fair warning, so beware!" "I turned in the direction pointed, and beheld a lady seated at the piano, surrounded by two or three young gentlemen.  I took a step forward and discovered to my joy and astonishment that it was Jennie Graham, the fair object of my present visit to the city. "'Why, how you stare and blush, and tremble; are you ill? or do you see a ghost, an houri, or a devil?' "'A passing spasm  only; I shall be better directly,' cried I. ' Come, let's go doff our uncouth attire; we look ridiculous.' "' Not now, my friend; come, let me introduce you to Miss Graham.' "'Nay, but tarry a moment, she is going to sing.' She ran her hands over the keys once or twice at random; and as she did so, I saw that her mind was far away from     "8  I  AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. all around her-possibly, ah! possibly, thinking of me; but my revery was interrupted as she presently broke forth and sang in low, plaintive tones, that beautiful song : "She's far from the land where her young hero sleeps." '"As she concluded I felt subdued and enchanted ; my heart beat wildly as I stole impetuously forward to the back of her chair, and leaning over, whispered "Jennie, dearest Jennie!"With a start she turned round, exclaiming,- "' Who? what? can it be,-this is--' "' Your young hero; may I not hope?' "' In a second her face was suffused with blushes, her neck, her hands, even to her fingers' ends. '"Jennie!' "Will--Mr. Aikin!' "I warmly grasped her extended hand, and led her from her astonished and disconcerted admirers to a sofa in a distant part of the room; and as I did so, not with little  difficulty suppressed a smile as I passed my poor bewildered friend, Hartmus, who stood gazing after me in profound amazement. "A glorious and triumphant night was that to me! ah! I was continually triumphant. Days and weeks flew swiftly by, and we became the most intimate friends and constant companions. She knew that I loved her, ah! and that passionately--madly; and I was sure, very sure that she returned my love. For, although she was constantly sur-  i rounded by wealthy, talented and distinguished admirers, yet she was only courteous to them, while she was kind, affectionate and true to me. To me only did her voice tremble; to me only did she give the sudden blush and the sweet endearing smile. But if I dwell longer, Brown, boy, I'll weary your patience. Let it suffice, my wooing was not unsuccessful. I won her, and in company with her we returned to the south, where we were soon united. For   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     119 three years we dwelt together peacefully and happily, existing alone in each others society. But, alas! alas! our happiness was too great to last. The grim destroyer, Death, cut off my fair flower; she passed away as a sun- beam, leaving a dark void in my heart. And ever since the sad occurrence I've been a wanderer upon the face of the earth, seeking happiness where it is to be found, whether at the mart or the quiet homestead, the village, the city, or the wilderness. j"And now, my young friend, I'm at the end of my   story; and as the evening is growing late, let us go to bed." ia i  *                          a     AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  .     !  , fat] 9VENTURES IN THE cARoLINAS, CONTIA   I .no ; lt^w old '.- '::         a 1!

My poo i   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     1]21 father, in consequence, became almost a distracted man. What would he do now, bereft of his fine estate ? nursed, as he had ever been, in the lap of luxury, knowing no care, no want! We had been driven out of our old homestead, and had sought an humble refuge and shelter in the lowly cot of an old servant.  In a few weeks the old castle, with its broad acres, which had descended down from father to son " for a period whereof the memory of man runs not to the con- trary," would be sold at auction. A few days prior to the sale my father mounted me upon his only remaining horse, and started me to Toledo, to beg a little respite from his creditor until he could look around him and try to divert the pending calamity. Accordingly I mounted, with a sad heart, and started on the hopeless journey. The villain who had induced him to embark in a wild speculation, and then defrauded him out of his all, was an old Jewish miser, noted for his wealth and sor- didness. My father would have appealed to the laws, but what could he do ? How could justice be meted out to him in Spain, poor as he now was, and against such odds ? Indeed, our cause was desperate.  Our only hopes depended upon the chance of getting a little time to look up a purchaser; trusting thereby, to save enough from the general wreck to purchase a little home. 0 ! what a down- fall was that! The lord of a hundred vassals doomed to become a day-laborer for his very bread ! My refined and delicate sisters, who had been sought after even by royalty, to go out into the cold world as governesses. The thought was madness! But the oppressor was in Toledo, and I must needs go and fawn upon him for a few days' grace. But why should I rave now ? It was with a heavy heart, then, that I set out. On the evening of the third day after my departure I neared the      122   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS  city, and would have gained it before night-fall, but a  severe storm came up which greatly impeded my progress: t, still I pressed forward; and as I did so the storm and  darkness increased apace. A few stars only twinkled  through the thin veil which covered but a small portion of   the heavens. However, I spurred madly on; but the spir"  ited steed needed no such incitement, and bounded swiftly over the beaten road.  As I pressed forward I could perceive a tall house loom- ; ing up by the side of the road; as I neared it I perceived  that it was a building known as St. Mary's Convent, but .;  now used only as a common receptacle for the dead. As I : -;. spurred past its wide door a clattering, clashing noise i within rang out on the still night, followed by a frightful t scream. I wheeled and sprang off, and rattled at the door, W .r but was answered only by deep groans. I sprang back to i: :  t( my horse and was about to fly from the spot in affright, i when a thought flashed across my mind; it might be some y  wretch entombed alive! I will go back and see, thought I, though it were the devil. I do not aim to take too much I f credit to myself for my resolution, for my hair stood on I end, and my teeth chattered, and every limb quaked with 1 --I will not say fear-but excitement.  I led my horse back and fastened him securely. I rattled  again at the door and halloed aloud, but was answered only  by the deep groans within. I shook the door violently, 1  ofe and it burst open with a slam that made me spring back a  rod. I groped-my way in, at the same time calling aloud. k  "Here! here!" exclaimed a voice; "if you be man or a  devil help me out of this charnel-house. I will make you a  f very rich. I will give you all mine monish!" i y "Who and what are you, in the devil's name?" cried I, 1 1 endeavoring, in vain, to speak in a bold and steady voice. ral Coa(   AMERICAN NIGHTS'    RAm    .    2 ElYTERTAINMENTS.   123* "Ishmael Weil.

So saying, I gathered him up, as I would a bundle of dried faggots, and strode out, mounted my horse, and gal- loped off at the top of my speed. Being well acquainted with all the localities of Toledo, I galloped into the city. The night was as dark as blackness, and the lanterns gave but a faint light. The clatter and clash of my horse's feet sounded dismally over the flagged pavements, and the few stragglers on the streets looked after me in wonder, as If I were, in reality, the devil. I rode up to the Jew's misera- ble house, for I was acquainted with its locality, flung open a casement, and, without dismounting, thrust him through, and rode off at the top of my speed. I repaired to tlhn inn before alluded to, ordered supper and wine to be sent to my room, and repaired thither at once, to think over my strange, marvellous, and ludicrous adventure. Had I frightened the old sinner sufficiently to force him to right my father? O! that would be too much happi- ness. 'Had I? had I?" was asked of myself a thousand times that night. O! how I would gladden the heart of my old father, dry up the tears of my dear old mother, and bring roses again to the cheeks of my dejected sisters! O, that long and weary night! Methought it would   never end. Morning came at last, and at its first peep I was up and dressed. Summohing a servant, I inquired if Ishmael Weil was in the city. He stared at me with aston- ishment, saying- "Weil, sir, is dead and buried; he died several days Y1rp\        While talking with the servant I was summoned down to the tap. How my heart leaped for joy as I sprang past the astonished servant and rushed headlong down the sta':rs. "Who wants me?" inquired I, of a knot of persons, that stood at the landing. "If you please, sir, Mr. Weil requests your immediate presence at his house," replied one of the crowd. "He died the other day, and came to life again. He says the devil brought him back on a big black horse; and I sus- pect he did, for we found him, this morning, sitting in his old arm-chair, fumbling over his papers. Wheugh! what a fright he gave us! I never shall get over it!" I called for a cab, and, in five minutes, was set down at his house. I was ushered into a little, low, dirty room, where sat the old miser, with a bundle of papers before hm. "You bes John Crawford, son of Samuel Crawford." "That is my name, sir; and I address Mr. Weil, if I mnitake not." " as-yas! I sent for you, Mr. Crawford, on a-little matter of business. In looking over my papers I  find a balance due your father of twenty-eight tousand pounds, the exact amount I tought he owed me. I heard from a friend, last night, dat you was in de city, and I tought I would send for you at once. Here are your receipts, in full, which you will show to the officers and stop all pro- ceedings in the case of Weil vs. Crawford. Take them, I11*  26   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. young man; you will find them duly signed and authenti- cated." Be assured I was not backward in clutching the precious treasure. "Goot-byes, Mester Crawford!' I shook the old sinner by the hand, and, as I strode out, I was astonished to see the street crowded by an excited throng, in front of the house. The news spread like wild- fire through the city, that the devil hadl brought back old Weil, as a person altogether too bad for his regions. I may here state that the old Jew henceforth was an altered man. He became a pious, useful, and a charitable citizen. An hour after, I mounted my " bonny, bonny steed," and sped homeward. Not a lighter heart than mine beat in the wide world. What joy would I bring to my lather's house! O! the sweet draught of fancy! I quaffed like unto a drunken man. In due time I arrived. But no words can tell the scene that followed when I related my adventures. My old father hugged me, his pride, until I was fain to cry out; my mother kissed me again and again; my sisters cried for very joy, and the servants, even, embraced me, till I was sore for a week afterwards. I need only say that the talents of the sheriff were not put into requisition, and that the very next day we moved back to the old homestead. "Good! good, Major-very good indeed!" exclaimed I, delighted at the recital; " if it would not be presuming on your good humor too much, I would fain beg for ' a few more of the same sort.'" "' Well, boy, well, you shall have another. What shall it be? O! ay, I'll give you one as related to me, a few weeks ago, by my friend, R. A. Pryor, and that, too, in  AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.       127 his own language. However, I'll take the liberty of naming and styling it The Events of a Night. "The old house lies in ruin and wreck, And the villagers stand in fear aloof; The rafters bend, and the boards are blacki But bright green mosses spot the roof; The window panes are shattered out, And the broken glass is lying about; And the elms and poplars cast a shade All day long on the colonade. I hear a noise in the echoing halls,           E- A solemn sound like a stifled sigh; And shadows move on the dusky walls, Like the sweep of garments passing by; And faces glimmer amid the gloom, Floating along from room to room; The dead come back, a shining train, And people the lonely house again."            : It was a  dark, black night.  The winds came  and went in fitful gusts, and the rain began bespattering the hillside, the precursor of the storm that was to follow. But darker  far was my   aching heart-more piercing and chilling  far* was the anguish than the  drenching rain, or the chilling blast; so, giving my   steed the rein, I spurred madly on,   ! lighted only by an occasional flash of lightning, or the gleam of some   will-o'-the-wisp, or swamp ball, as it would shoot past me, or follow whizzing  in my   wake. But a* moment's retrospection. Like the generality of my kind I  once and still have a weakness, and, entre nocs, I   hope, by the grace of God, I  may ever have.  I  loved--loved madly.  The object of my  admiration was a   beautiful being. Sallie Street had but  few equals and no superiors in point of loveliness, grace  Ind amiability.  She had a  soft, melting eye, a rich, pout-J -       ijS     3   AAMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. ing lip, a blooming, healthful cheek, dark, flowing ringlets, a well rounded instep, a pretty foot. She had many suiters, had Sallie Street, and some of them distinguished, wealthy and accomplished gentlemen. But, nevertheless, I was successful. I outstripped them all. I never told her, verbally, that I loved her, nor asked her if she loved me in return. It was useless. I knew it by the trembling, faltering voice, the soft pressure of the hand, the melting, languishing glance of the eye, the tremulous heaving of the breast, the sweet, endearing smile-these were mine and mine alone. To others her bearing was different, though courteous and kind. Her father's elegant mansion stood a mile from the vil- lage of Halifax, Va.; so thither, with buoyant hopes and a heart filled up with sweet and tender feelings, I set out, one evening, to declare, verbally, my love, and to propose for her hand. Already was I treated as one of the family; and, taking my accustomed privilege, I walked into the house without ringing. Seeing no one, I passed through the parlor and was about entering the common sitting-room, when, through an adjacent door that stood a little ajar, I saw-oh! horror of borrows! I saw that which pierced my heart with a keener pang than the deadly sting of a poison serpant. I saw my loved one-her I scarcely dared to kiss, or dream, even, of the quick, nervous, pleasurable and ecstatic thrill at the pressure-reclining, ay! in a locked embrace, upon the knee of some moustached, foreign looking gentleman, with her lips sealed to his and tears streaming from her eyes.  O, God! the anguish of that moment. One second was I tempted to tear out his heart; but, reflecting, I turned upon my heel and stole out unseen. I wended my way back to the village; and, though half- distracted, yet I wound up my little affairs-for I was but a medical student-mounted my faithful steed, and by dark    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.   1;29 I was on the high-way, and on my way I knew not, cared not whither, so that I made good my escape from the detested village and my faithless mistress. I had not gone five miles before it was as dark as black- ness-my hand I could not distinguish before me. The wind and rain came sweeping over the bare fields with biting unction, and howled, and hissed, and roared as if all the storm fiends were let loose, and were rioting and revel- ling in mockery at my sufferings. The storm increased apace, so that I was forced to seek shelter, in mercy to my poor horse, in an old Church House that stood on the road side, and at which my horse now instinctively halted. I pushed open the door and rode in. It was so dark I could almost feel it; but it accorded with my feelings well. The storm without was still raging, and the old house, at intervals, would writhe and tremble like a thing of life. All at once my horse gave a loud snort and started back against the benches that lined either side of the house. I looked up but could see nothing, but heard, distinctly, a rustling, shuffling noise near the pulpit. A flash of light- ning just then lighted up the scene, and I saw, with fearful distinctness, a figure standing on the altar, with long, flow- ing garments and arms distended wide. O, heavens! what a fearful moment! My hair stood on end, my blood froze in my veins, and-- but this was no time for thought--another prolonged flash of lightning again lighted up the place. I saw the figure again, flying over the benches towards me; I hoped it was but an image conjured up by an over-heated and diseased imagination; but no! my horse, with a wild, unearthly neigh, or rather scream, and a fearful bound, sprang out of the house, and with the speed of the wind, he carried me over hill, dale and moor, thicket, highway and wood, I knew not where.   30   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. But on--on we went. The sweat and foam streamed from my panting steed, but still he relaxed not in his speed, while I clung instinctively to the saddle and let him go where he listed. After an hour's ride-such a ride as no other mortal ever took-my horse wheeled a short angle in the road which we had at last gained, and halted abruptly before a large house, from whose windows streamed a dozen lights. And a welcome sight was that! I threw the reins over my horse's head and dismounted. I knew not, in the gloom and dark-' ness of the night, and the excitement of my mind, whose house it was, or where my position--whether in Virginia" Carolina or the Western Continent at large. I ran up the steps into a large piazza ; and as I groped my way along the side of the house for the door, I passed a window from which streamed a light. I looked eagerly in and saw a young lady seated at a table close by the window, and but a few feet from where I stood. I raised on tip-toe and took a nearer look-but who can portray my astonishment on finding it to be my faithless mistress. Thinking it was but another being conjured up by the devil, I was about to fly the spot, when she raised a small miniature to her lips; and, as she did so, I discovered it to be a likeness of myself --one I had presented to her a few weeks previous. O! this was too much happiness--or was it still the machina- tions of the devil? I resolved to solve the mystery, let what would be in store for me. I rattled at the door;, and waited with a mixture of strange feelings---with joy, with fear, with trembling. A servant, after a moment, ushured me into the house; which I found, to my profound astonishment, to be that of my friend, Col. Street, the father of her I loved. The colonel greeted me, and, after expressing much surprise at seeing me at so late an hour, and in such a plight as I was    in, led forward his son, in the person of the moustached, foreign-looking gentleman, who had been absent at sea two years, and whom I never saw. The mystery was explained -and oh! h'ow satisfactorily! It was the long absent brother, whom they had thouoght dead, greeting the dear sister. And I had occular proof, that night, that I was beloved; not only by the scene at the window, of the miniature, but from her own pouting lips. I sat down, and, though the hour was late, gave an account of my adventures through the night; and many anid loud were the peals of laughter that brokle forth from the happy throng at the recital. The adventure in the church was explained. There was a crazy woman in the neighborhood of the church, who, whenever she could escape from her friends, would go to the church and stay, sometimes, for days. 'Thus was the mystery explained. Just as the Major finished his story, we were deafened by shouts from at least a dozen little ragged urchins cheer- ing thleir daddy, who had just returned with the meal for our breakfast. We sprang joyously from the bed, and, as we did so, took up the shout and  gave, likewise, three hearty cheers in honor of his arrival.  NINTH     PTE NIG HT            i: m THE PLANTERS.     -  HAVING partaken heartily of our long deferred meal of 0 Indian maize, we mounted our horses and betook ourselves again to the road. Merrily, for awhile, we galloped along  the smooth sandy roads of this beautiful country, and with i: X admiring eyes we took in the fair prospect, even as a horse- X jockey would delight to scan the clean limbs and fair pro- portions of some noble animal-the broad acres of rich lands, teeming with verdure, tall forests, waving grass and i  beautiful flowers. The sight, as the Majo- would insist, was good for sore eyes, .ennui, and divers other ills to which flesh is heir.                 a: Towards noon, as we emerged from the more woodled to the clear, open country, the sun poured down his rays with scorching heat, but still we jogged on our way at a rapid pace, though with less of that exhuberance of spirit than when we sat out in the morning-far less ; for I became tired, dull, heavy and lazy. The Major was not altogether free himself, notwithstanding his protestations to the con- trary. Still, he made many efforts to overcome his drowsi-  ness; finally he lectured me for being so dull and melancholy, as if he was himself free from the weakness. "Never despond, boy, and give way to languor, never despond over the dark side of the past, the cares and perplexities of the present, the doubt and anxiety of the dim future. Few   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        13  things are more pernicious than to sit and brood over the dark side, to give way to despondency under the weakness and langour of the physical man, as now, or even when stricken low with disease.  It creates a morbid sensibility which finds its food in this very course of conduct, and the mind may prey upon itself until it becomes crabbed and eats its own vitality. But, it's too warm to lecture now, I admit; so, my son, I'll e'en sing you a song in lieu thereof to keep your eyes i open, in which I'll portray   my disposition, feelings and nature, under all circumstances, and at all times ; and you in return, must tell me, in song or prose, why this unwonted languor, this sadness; it's not caused alone by the heat and fatigue of the day. But here goes the song:-- "( Let those who will repine at fate, And droop their heads with sorrow; I laugh when cares upon me wait- I know they'll leave to-morrow. My purse is light, but what of that s My heart is light to match it; And if I tear my only coat, I laugh the while I patch it. I've seen some elves, who call themselves My friends, in summer weather, Blown far away in sorrow's day, As winds would blow a feather. I never grieve to see them go, (The rascals, who would heed 'em?) For what's the use of having friends, If false when most you need 'em? "I've seen some, rich in worldly gear, Eternally repining; Their heart's a prey to every fear, With gladness never shining, I  would not change my lightsome heart For all this gold and sorrow; For that's a thing that all their wealth, Can neither buy nor borrow. I 12    134     AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS&.  "And still, as sorrows come to me, (As sorrow oft will come,) I find the way to make them flee Is bidding them right welcome. They cannot brook a cheerful look- They're used to sobs and sighing, And he that meets them with a smile, Ts sure to set them flying." The Major's   voice sounded musically enough, and the spirit, as well as the strains, poured   on my heart, as I caught every word, like the refreshing dews of heaven to the drooping flower. But, as I had promised a song in return, I broke forth and chanted the following   melancholy lines, by Chilton:- "Oh! ask not why I heave a sigh, And wear a brow of sadness, This aching heart can bear no part In scenes of joy and gladness. "'Tis sweet to see the young and fair Bound in the mazy dance delighted, When lyre and voice bid all rejoice, O'er happy hearts by love united. "But to the heart that feels love's smart, Yet hopeless pines, its thoughts concealing, A scene like this affords no bliss, But wakes a sad and deeper feeling. "Then ask not why I heave the sigh, Or wear a brow of sadness ; This aching heart can bear no part In scenes of joy and gladness." "By Jupiter Ammon! but you sing like a jay-bird, Brown; but, fie! fie! an' it's not the sultry sun that brings the sadness, eh? Love, ah? but what fools youngsters are : "Yet hopeless pines, its thoughts concealing!" Why, boy, she knows you love her, as well as if you had   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.       135 told her yourself; and if you had not been blind you could have seen with half an eye that Miss Avery loved you, too. Nay, no blushing, no stammering; I'm too old in love matters to be mistaken.  So no more pining on that score, do you hear?" A loud, merry laugh at his earnestness was my involun- tary response. "Why, Major, I sang that sad, sentimental song because it accorded with my heavy feelings somewhat, and because it popped into my head at the time. I halted almost a moment before singing, debating whether I should sing ' Kate Kearney,' or the other." 'Oh, aye; playing 'possom, eh? But now that you've been so indiscreet as to tell that you know that old air, you must even sing it; it's been many a long day since I heard it." Having no other alternative, and being fairly caught, I sang, in compliance with his request, as follows:- "Oh! did you e'er hear of Kate Kearney? She lives on the banks of Killarney; From the glance of her eye Shun danger and fly, For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney. "For that eye is so modestly beaming, You'd ne'er think of mischief she's dreaming, Yetoh I who can tell How fatal's the spell That lurks in the eye of Kate Kearney. "Though she looks so bewitchingly simple, There's-'mischief in eveey dimple; And who dares inhale The mouth's spicy gale, Must die by the breath of Kate Kearney." "That song, Brown, awakens an old circumstance where- in I played a part, long, long years agone.   I cannot help indulging in a hearty   laugh when thinking of it.   I was     136    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.       but a lad of eighteen summers when my father sent me to Columbia to school. Soon after entering school I was invited with a few others of my class to a party in the city. I was exceedingly charmed with a young lady I met there. I was in the first place attracted by her musical powers, and secondly by her charming person. I saw her first in ( the ball-room, and it was she I first heard sing those beau- 't tiful lines you were so kind as to entertain us with just now.                         i I thought the strains heavenly-but I was young then. - Her figure, too, was neat, her movements graceful, her dress rich and tasty, her mind cultivated, and her air queenly  All these captivated me ; in short, took my heart by storm. I loved her; and as I had never seen her only at church, the ball-room and theatre, I resolved one day, to make her a call. So one beautiful morning, with buoy- ant hopes and prospects bright, I set out to her residence A to-to speak of my love; for I had as yet only intimated by delicate attentions and the language of the eye that she was dear to me. It was rather early in the morning to pay a visit, but I was just from the country, and knew nothing of fashionable city hours. I reached the house, a large, elegant mansion, a few moments after setting out; but, oh, horror of horrors! I met my angel in the entry with her dress all open behind, her hair in papers, her feet slip-shod and great holes in ; the heels thereof; she had a dirty French novel in her hand, and--and a filthy pipe in her mouth! I turned upon my heel, and have never seen her from that day to this. That's the first time I ever fell in love;" and the Major heaved a, deep sigh, and made a vigorous attack upon a huge apple which he drew from his portmanteau. The remainder of the day we journeyed on in silence, i :? each one deeply buried in his own reflections. Night came     AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    137 on apace, and the stars began peering out here and there in the blue vault above ere we bethought us of procuring a place of lodging. We turned an angle in the road, and beheld, to our no little satisfaction, a large, elegant mansion, with a score or so of little negro cabins ranged on either side, like the residences of the wealthiest pachas and their retinues, in eastern countries. "Hilloa!" cried I, as we rode up in front of the house. A well dressed elderly looking personage stepped out on the piazza. "Can we get lodging and entertainment here, sir, for the night?" "I hardly think I can take you in, gentlemen; I don't keep an inn." "I didn't expect you did, sir; but it's night, we are tired and hungry, are strangers to the country, and-" "Well, gentlemen, alight and walk in; never let it be said a southern gentleman refused hospitality to a stranger, whether he be rich or poor, learned or illiterate, bond or free. Here, Sam-Dick-Joe--some of you attend to these horses. That's it boys, be brisk. Come, come gen- tlemen, walk in." We were shown into'a large, finely furnished room, near the centre of which sat a long table, around which a number of ladies and gentlemen were just seating themselves. We introduced ourselves to the company, apologized for disturb- ing them while about engaging themselves so agreeably, as the Major blandly remarked, and sat down with them. The company we found quite jovial and merry, particu- larly so, Father Whitfield, as he was called, a sleek, good- natured, jolly looking priest, brother to the gentlemanly proprietor.  Three or four ladies, a middle aged German, fresh from the " fader land," three young gentlemen, and 12*     38    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. an intelligent little girl, only daughter of the host, made up the company. Father Whitfield having finished his blessing, and return- ed thanks for the many good things set before us, the host courteously invited me to carve a roast pig which he pushed over towards mie.   Not being very expert with the dissect- ing knife, and being, withal, a somewhat bashful youth, I solicited the Major to do the agreeable in my stead. "Certainly, certainly, Mr. Brown; the exercise is my delight. But, ladies and gentlemen," continued he, turning to the company, "I could never engage to carve a pig without offering up, with the most agreeable feelings, the following grateful tribute of epicurean gusto to the pig, as also to the author, my old friend, Lesingham Smith, rector of Canfield, Essex, England. TO THE ROAST PIG. O Oh, pig! or rather little pork, once pig, Smoking so daintily on table, Making the gazer long that he were able To eat thee, every limb, both small and big, No more, in squeaking flight or grunting jig, Thou runnest about the straw yard, sty or stable, Nor bump'st thy little side against the gable, Nor cock'st thy snout, a judge without a wig. All other viands, which I ever saw Served up in silver, crockery-ware or tin, Whether broiled, roasted, baked, stewed, fried or raw, Compared with thee, are worthless as a pin! Sweet, delicate meat! crackling without a flaw! What ho! a knife and fork! I must begin," The tribute, or rather rhapsody, was received with much applause by the company. "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the German, as the Major, with great dexterity and skill sliced up the delicious dish, and began filling the many orders of the fasting company;    AMERICAN NIGIITS ENTERTAINMENTS.     1 "ha! ha! ha! Mynheer, you carve te leetle hog so wee], you ten' as great favor to me to carve te fowls, too; me   i frait tey slip out te plate--der sind frey ne, yah!" And, lifting a fowl from a dish where lay a half dozen of its fellows, he was just about placing it on a plate to send to the Major for dissection, when, to the great horror and consternation of the Dutchman, and the merriment of the company, a huge pet monkey which the proprietor kept on the premises, sprang through a window in close prox- imity to the Dutchman, and snatched the fowl from his'fork as he was handing it back to a servant. "Ter tuvel! ter tam tuvel! Pardon ladies for ter oath, :  but ter tam varmint mit its pad manners scaret me. Choost to tink of it! Dunter an' plixum! Mynheer Whitfield, hash you got von manasherie to scare some of your guests to teath, an' cause others to show pad manners?" "Pardon! pardon!" cried the host. "I hope my hon- i  ored guest, Her Von Well, will excuse our merriment; the ;  circumstance was so rediculous we could not restrain our feelings." $ "Methought," continued the- enraged Her Von Weil, ' you hat plenty of tam monkey negroes without keeping such varmints to trouble some, and please others of your guests;" and he looked round sulkily at the company,  giving the Major and myself a scowl of ill-suppressed rage. "Pa," cried little Edith, Mr. Whitfield's daughter, "do let me whip it or fasten it up; it's always in mischief; no later than last night it tore all the red lining out of my new Panama hat-the impudent little scamp!" ' I'm sorry," interposed the General, that some of my guests are offended at the monkey, as well, also, as our merriment. That monkey, Von Weil, is one of my earliest, best friends. It did me a great favor once, for which I tolerate its little mischevous pranks. I would not part with it for half a dozen the best negroes in Carolina. So Edith,     "O   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        i my daughter, you must not hurt it; were it an intelligent A creature, the provocation is sufficiently great to justify you 'in punishing it; as it is, it shan't be hurt." r"I, too," cried I, little pleased at the evident rudeness and ill-breeding of the Dutchman, "I, too, like Crocket, e would beg pardon, did I know which it would be proper to o crave it of, Her Von Well or the monkey. But pray, General, be so kind as to tell us how the monkey laid vou under such profound obligations ; you have excited my curiosity, and I would be exceedingly glad, as would, I have no doubt, the company generally, if you would tell it uS. "Pray tell it, General," cried the company, all. ( Ah! listen, listen!" interrupted the incensed Dutch- man, sneeringly; "how curiosity excites them. I always heard pefore leafing mine fater landt, tat curiosity pees de national trait of you Yankee Americans; now I sees for mine eyes and hears for mine ears. It's chiltish; you all want to pry into eferyting like childers." "True, true," replied I, " our national characteristic is curiosity: we are alike an enterprising and progressive people, enquiring into everything, in order to learn. The mind is not dull, heavy, and inactive; it must have some- thing to engage it. Curiosity, as you rightly observed, Mynheer Von Well, is our national trait; but, sir, fear is yours." "Nay, nay," replied the Dutchman, " you pees in error ; you can't prove it in a single instance; if you can I gives it up." "That I can, most assuredly," replied I. "Well, ten, if you can, go on mit your proofs." "Well, Mynheer Von Well, I lived some years ago in Uniontown; there lived in the same neighborhood an old Dutchman, who had been crippled with rheumatic pains for   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    141 many years, so that he could not walk nor use his legs in the least. Well, near the town was a graveyard, in which, the proprietor of -he field occasionally turned his sheep to graze and crop off the long grass. "' It was to this graveyard, then, that two thieves betook themselves one night for the purpose of possessing them- selves of one of these fat, fleecy fellows. It was about twelve o'clock, that most solemn and fearful hour of night; when ghosts are abroad, and when hobgoblins and devils hold their revels. The night was fearfully dark; the winds came and went in fitful gusts, and roared and howled and screamed through the tall trees in the enclos- ure as if all the fiends were let loose, and were rioting on some extraordinary occasion. Ever and anon sharp flashes of lightning would light up the scene around, giving to objects the most unearthly and spectral appearance. A better night could not have been chosen by the thieves for the safe performance of their purpose than the one in question; still they deemed it advisable for one to stand on the watch while the other secured his prey. Accord- ingly one of them took his station outside the gate while the other entered. He had not been stationed long ere it chanced that the Dutchman came by, seated upon the shoulders of his son, on their return from a neighbor's in the country. Just as they passed the gate a flash of lightning revealed them for a moment to the thief in waiting, who, seeing something on the back of the other, very naturally thought it his companion with the sheep upon his back, and springing joyfully forward, exclaimed to his supposed comrade, "Is he fat? is he fat?" "Fat or lean," exclaimed the affrighted young man, "here, take him, devil, and let me go this time;" and, dropping his father, away he sprang with the speed of a frightened deer for his home. Over ditches and hedges, I[     "2   .AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.         fences, rocks, briers, he heeded them not, but on, on, he flew till he reached home. But scarce had he burst open the door and sprang in ere something lit in after him. Looking around he beheld, not the devil, as he expected, but--his father, who had not walked before for twenty years. Able physicians had despaired of ever restoring him the use of his limbs again ; but you see, Mynheer Von Weil, the great physician, Fear, your national trait, is with you Dutch better than any potion or balm invented by the most learned Esculapius of the land. Do you give it up, Herr Von Weil?" "Not I! not I! He was no fool-plooded German, I'll pe assured of that. Your proof, Mynheer Brown, is not sufficient; I no gives it up, not von leetle bits." "Well, then, Von Weil," continued I, "I'll come nearer home ; when the monkey snatched the fowl from your fork, who was it that was then frightened, alone, of all the com- pany? You, most certainly, for you acknowledged it yourself, of your own accord. Do you give it up now." "An who would not pe frightened at te dam varmint?

Order being restored, the General, at the solicitations of the company, told his interesting story, as will be seen by the next "Night."   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     143 ITENTH NIGHT. THE MONKEY. THE house having come to order, Mr. Whitfield began as follows: "Sixteen years ago there dwelt, in Norfolk, Va., a. young law-student.  Though poor in this world's goods, he was rich in mental and  personal attractions. He was of tall stature and commanding appearance, and though his coun- tenance could not be said to be handsome, yet it was one of those that please at first sight. His income, though small, with economy was sufficient to maintain him some years to come; he had talents, energy, buoyant hopes, and was, consequently, happy and contented. "He was sitting, one day, in a little piazza in front of his law-office, poring over a tome of Valin's, when a stout countryman rode up and inquired of him if 'Lawyer Gra- ham was in.' The student replied he was not; that he was off on his circuit, and he would not be back for a fortnight. 'Goodness gracious!  cried the man, " what will I do? ut arn't you a  student o' lawyer Graham's?' '"The student nodded assent. "  Well, now, you'll do jest as well. You see old Mr. Guthrie, out on Swampfield, is liken to die, an' he sent me over to get some on ye to come and write his will. "'Very well, my  good man; I'll go with you immedi- ately,' replied the student. ; .                     p     "4    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. "So he ordered his horse and set out on the instant. As they had some miles to ride, and as the day was already on the decline, and the sky looked rather lowering, they pushed forward briskly; the young man especially so, as this was his first case of practice in the legal profession. "On their route they had a long hill, or mountain, to cross, known as ' Linden's Hill.' As they commenced the ascent, large drops of rain began bespotting the hillside, for the clouds had been lowering and blackening for some time. Ere they reached the summit the wind set in from the east and blew almost a hurricane. The large pine trees, with which the hill was covered on either side, rocked to and fro like tempest-tossed vessels, lapping their bushy heads together, and groaning and cracking at a fearful rate. "Just as they gained the hill, the young man was startled and horrified at the sight of a chaise and four horses dashing madly towards him. A large tree which had been blown over near the carriage, affrighted the horses, who sprang off wildly, threw the driver from his seat, and dashed furiously down the almost perpendicular road, towards our hero and his companion. What was his consternation to behold it tenanted by two females! Another moment and they would be dashed to pieces. The student's heart almost ceased its pulsations, for his blood froze in his veins. His companion stood paralyzed; but our hero, seeing the danger, sprang out recklessly into the road; but, on a second thought, he saw he might as well try to oppose the passage of the mountain torrent; so, with the agility of light, he sprang back, and, as a thought flashed across his mind, he drew a revolver, as the only and dernier resort, and fired on the two wheel-horses, who, with one fearful leap forward, fell dead, and were dragged -   '- AMERICAN  NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     145 :i: along, with the carriage, by the two remaining horses, e;-? many paces ere they were stopped. '"Having calmed the horses, he now sprang forward to the aid of those whom he had so fortunately rescued. One a,: of them, an elderly lady, apparently a governess or confi- dential servant, leaped out and assisted him to lift her mis- tress, a beautiful young lady, from the carriage, who, over- come by her fright, had swooned away. She was one of the most beautiful beings imaginable. Full eighteen sum- mers had passed over her, and ripened her charms to per- fection. And, as the young student gazed on her sylph- like form, her large, lustrous eyes, her polished brow, and ; cherry lips, he felt as though he were gazing on a thing not of earth-one that he could love, ay, worship. And as she gave him her hand, and, with sweetest voice, thanked him and called him her dear preserver, he could not but acknowledge to himself that he did-that he did love her. "By this time his companion and the driver came up, the latter having been only stunned, and assisted in repair- ing the carriage and harnessing in the two remaining horses. In a few moments they were again ready to set out; and, at the invitation of the lady, our hero most wil- lingly excused himself to the countryman, sprang into the carriage, and, in a moment, was winding his way back to the city. "He soon ascertained the fair one's name to be Massie Huff, daughter of one of the wealthiest and most aristo- cratic merchants of Norfolk. But it was with sadness, with a sorrowful heart, that he became apprised of it. He was already, he acknowledged, deeply smitten: but what chance would he, a poor, obscure student, have with the wealthy, accomplished, and courted belle of one of the first families of Virginia? ' He acknowledged it was folly to indulge even a hope; yet he did not act according to his 13     "6    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. acknowledgments; and, while seated by her side, he could not refrain from feasting his eyes, his soul, on so many charms, so many perfections. On arriving in the city, he delivered up his precious charge to her parents, who were profuse in their thanks, threw open their doors, and invited him to make their house his home whenever he chose, for he should always be a welcome guest. "It is not to be expected the invitation was neglected: he became a constant visitor, and was ever at the side of the fair belle; and although she had scores of wealthy, noble, and talented suitors, yet he never altogether des- paired, but pushed his suit with the greatest tact and zeal. The most ardent of his rivals was a gentleman from Wash- ington, whose fine person and ample fortune proclaimed him to be a dangerous competitor; especially so, as his suit was favored, and even urged, by her father. "But in the face of all opposition he wooed her-wooed her successfully, and won. But alas! her parents were strenuous in their opposition. Her father peremptorily forbade him his house, and forbade her seeing him under penalty of his lasting displeasure. But our hero, nothing daunted, waited on him again in the fervency of his pas sion; but he found him more violent in opposition thai ever. He rudely inquired of him what were his prospectl and fortune. On our hero's stating his circumstances, hi bade him crush his hopes and fruitless aspirations. c" ' When you can come with a fortune of forty thousan, dollars-equal to hers, then I will give your pretension consideration; till then, young man, you would do well t keep aloof from me and mine. Good morning, sir;' an the haughty nabob bowed him from the door. "( Stung to mnadness at his disappointment, and the scoI and contempt with which his pretensions had been receive by the proud merchant, he rushed back to his now dreal   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    147 little office, overcome with contending emotions. Alas! how sad was life--how dreary were all things now! cFar better would it have been,' he said, 'that we had never met. My life was comparatively happy then, but now it is all misery. Though poor, I was contented; but I can be contented thus no longer. Gold is necessary to my happi- ness, and gold I must have. I will gather up my little effects and seek it in some distant clime. I have a wealthy relative in the Indies, who, perhaps, will aid me in mending my fortunes ; so thither will I turn my steps. It cannot be made here by a profession. Already is every court and village thronged with professional men; so I am deter- mined on my course. But ere I go I must see may loved one once more.' And the same evening he met her in the park surrounding her father's residence. "The interview was truly affecting. The young man spoke of his ill success, consequent upon his fortune, and of his determination to seek it in some distant land. "' Will you be faithful, Massie, and think of me some- times, when far away?' cried he. "' Oh! I will!' replied she, as she fell sobbing on his bosom. "L I know, love, my case is almost hopeless; but I go strengthened and buoyed by your promise.' "'I would, sir, I would----' and the trembling maiden cast down her eyes and blushed scarlet. d   " ' You would what, Massie?' "I would willingly follow your fortunes: though you be poor and unknown, yet I would rather toil, ay, drudge 'a  for you in poverty, whom I love, than roll in wealth with an aching heart.' ("No! no! Massie, you know but little of the world, id  its sorrows, its cares, its hardships. I would not lower you from your sphere; I would not bring you to want. Have     "8   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. courage, then, to bear up, if only for a short time, and all will be well. I trust we may meet soon again, and under happier and better auspices.' "'O! then, if you will go, be assured I will ever love thee-thee alone; so do not despair, but hope on, hope ever. Remember, "Though the sun sets at night, and fainteth his ray, A light still remains, though the day fades away." "' Thank you, Massie, thank you;" and, pressing her a moment to his heart, the young man tore himself away. "The following evening saw him standing out from Norfolk, in the packet "Tom Dosser," for the West Indies. We will not touch upon his long and tiresome journey, his depression of spirits, his agony of mind; but let it suffice to say that he landed safely, after the most tiresome journey at Port Au Prince, in Hayti. Here he found many things to interest him. All manner of beings were congregated in the island, greedy of gain and striving industriously for that which, with the world, at least, levels all distinctions, and places the buffoon on an equal footing with the noblest; for the Indies were, at that time, the Eldorado of the world. "Here he rested some days before he attenApted to get into business. Situations could have been had in almost any establishment, but he was unfortunately, without letters of recommendation, having neglected to secure them before leaving home. Having made several unsuccessful appli- cations he set out to the interior in search of his uncle. After wandering over half the place, he found, to his grief and mortification, that his uncle had died some months pravious, and that his family had returned to England. What to do now he knew not. He could get no situation without recommendations; he knew no one on the island, and his little stock of cash had decreased considerably, , HLa   AMERICAN NIGHTS- ENTERTAINMENTS.    149 "At this crisis, not being acclimated, the heat, together with his anxious state of mind, brought on a burning fever, with which he lay several months. He was taken sick at a little inn near Salem, on the sea-shore, kept by an honest Irishman, to whose kind attention he owed his life. When he recovered, his little stock of money was exhausted. He made the discovery known to his landlord, who, instead of thrusting him out, bade him make his home with him as long as he chose; 'for,' said he, 'I was a wanderer once, poor and friendless; och! an' I'm poor yet, but what I have is also yours.' Not so the physician, a vile Italian, who waited on him during his illness; he stripped him of everything le possessed, even his clothes, all but the one suit he wore. "His condition was now truly distressing, but he was not one to give way in despair; the parting words of his dear Massie rang in his ears, and he took courage when all seemed hopeless. He was still too weak to travel; so, with his gun in hand, he sauntered out daily, sometimes in com- pany with his kind host, along the sea-shore, endeavoring to gain strength and dispel, as well ha he could, all thoughts of his forlorn condition. "One day, when he was nearly recovered, he took his gun and wandered out. This day he wandered father than was his usual custom, for he felt extremely sad and depress- ed. He roved about a long time without finding any game. Finally he neared a clump of cocoa trees by the sea-side. As he approached, a large gang of monkeys, with which the islands abound, scampered off and clambered up the surrounding trees-and one little fellow, especially, ran jabbering up the tree under which our hero reclined. He kept up such a racket with his chattering, and made so many wry faces and grimaces at him, that it seemed to the young man as if he was doing it in derision and mockery 13*     150    AMERICAN NIGHTSI ENTERTAINMENTS. of his sorrows and sufferings. He attempted to scare him out by throwing sticks and stones at him, but the little fel- low only became worse; he even tore off branches and nuts and threw back at him; when, getting out of humor, as well as patience, the young man raised his gun to his shoulder and fired on the mischievous little animal. "Down it came, tumbling from branch to branch, till it reached the ground. On running up he found he had not killed it, but only broken its leg; and, as it moaned so piteously, he thought he would take compassion on it and put it out of its misery. He took off one of his suspenders, and, tying a stone to one end and the other to the monkey, carried it to the sea-side and threw it in near the outlet of a large creek, where the water was perfectly clear. ,He saw it sink headlong to the bottom-a distance of ten feet; but it immediately turned towards him, held up its hands, and, with an imploring look, fixed its large, full eyes so piteously upon him that he turned away in remorse, and in horror sought to flee the spot. But he could not fly; the beseeching eyes of the poor monkey were upon him where ever he turned, and his conscience cried out, ' Murder! murder!' so he sprang back, resolved to rescue it rather than lose his peace of mind. "Without pausing to divest himself of his clothing, he merely flung aside his hat and plunged into the water. In a moment he rose and drew the half-drowned money to the shore. After resting a moment, he turned to divest it of the stone hanging to its neck, when, what was his aston- ishment to perceive, for the first time, that he held clutched in his claws, a large diamond, partly covered with moss, which he had grappled while in the agonies of death. With the greatest possible agitation, he released the animal of its incumbrance, and examined it, which to his joy and anstonishment, he found was of great value, and had,   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    151 doubtless, been lost or thrown into the ocean many years perhaps centuries back y years, "The young man gazed on it, rubbed his eyes, pinched himself and halloed aloud, to make sure he was not dream- ing, for he could not believe, for some time, that such was his good fortune. From the deepest despair, from wretch- edness and almost want, he was now suddenly enriched far above his most grasping desires and aspirations in his palmiest days. "This sudden, marvellous and happy turn in his fortune overcame him so much that he could not move for some time. He was finally aroused from his pleasing reverie by the moaning of the poor monkey by his side; so he gathered up his precious treasure, placed the monkey as tenderly as possible upon his shoulders and At off for the inn. "On his way he resolved to communicate his good fortune to no one, but to proceed at once to Port Au Prince, and dispose of his treausure. Accordingly he placed the monkey under the protecting care of the kind hostess, and set out the next morning, with the promise to return speed- ily. As he turned to leave the door, the kind-hearted Irishman slipped a few guineas into his hand, telling him he would need them on the way.   And, with a heart too full for utterance at such kindness, the young man strode hastily away, to hide the copious flood of tears that burst forth and streamed down his cheeks. "The day following he arrived at his place of destina- :  tion, and, after much chaffering and bargaining, sold it to a company of London jewelers, who were then on the island, for eighty thousand dollars. As a ship was about sailing for Norfolk in a few days, he made all preparations to return in it. Having hired  a chaise  he hastily set out for the little inn, to see after his monkey, and to greet and     152    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. repay his kind host and family for all the kindness they had shown him in his adversity. On his return he was joyfully and affectionately greeted by his good friends: the monkey, too, he found, was almost well, under the kind treatment it had received, and as antic and mischievous as ever. "The following day he informed his friends of the change which had taken place in his fortune ;-that, by a kind interposition of Providence, he had become enriched as much as he desired. Great and sincere was the joy of the family; and more so was it when he informed them that he had purchased the little farm adjoining the landlord's, and presented it to them for their kindness and generosity towards him; telling them, ' I was a stranger, and ye took me in; I was an hungered and ye fed me.' "The gratitude of the family knew no bounds, manifest- ing their joy by tears and laughter. He tarried but a few days with the happy family, when, taking his little monkey and treasure, he embarked for Norfolk. "When he trod the deck not many months before, it was with an anxious and heavy heart, with a mind bowed down with grief and disappointment; now it was far different. Not a lighter or more buoyant heart beat on the seas; for he was now returning to his dear home, to his dear Massie, loaded with the wherewithal to satisfy the most grasping desires of her parsimonious father. "In due time he arrived, and found his beautiful Massie more gentle and lovely than ever. Her admirers were still numerous, and many of them pressing; but to all she was cold, yet courteous. The world wondered at her refusing so many advantageous offers. Some said she was heartless; some that she was a coquette; others that she had "' A lover lar o'er the deep blue sea:'   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    158 so speculation was at variance. But her own heart knew its secrets best-its hopes, its fears. "It may be imagined that not many hours flew by, after landing, till he enfolded his gentle Massie to his heart. Her parsimonious father was amply satisfied with his wealth; more than satisfied-he even rejoiced in having so industrious and energetic a son-in-law. Not many months elapsed till the now no longer poor, despised student, but wealthy merchant, led the choice of his heart to the altar. "And, on bended knee, I have thanked God every day since then," continued Gen. Whitfield, " for the merciless storm that overset the carriage on Linden Hill, and the remorse of conscience that made me return and rescue this poor monkey from a watery grave." "You, father? Why? What?" "Yes, my daughter; I am that poor student, your happy mother the courted belle, and Master Nips, there, the poor Avounded mon-but fie! fie! child, desist, or you'll smother him with your caresses." The recital was ended amid a round of applause. '"I, too, sir, am indebted to the monkey in question for my fortune, my happiness, my very existence," remarked a young gentleman at the table, when the General had con- cluded. ' The gentleman, Mr. Z. L. Burson, although a benedict, was quite a stripling. "Two years agone," continued the young man, "I was but a poor overseer. While yet in that capacity, I had occasion to pass by the plantation adjoining this. It was a beautiful summer's day--very warm and sultry, and the sun came down with scorching heat. I sat drowsily on my At-- 2 horse, now and then falling off into a doze of sleep. When I reached the little grove on the bank of the river, a half     154    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. mile above here, on the road you passed, gentlemen," he said, turning to the Major and myself, "I was aroused by the chattering, or rather screaming, of a pet monkey, that ran from the bank of the river towards me. Such gesticu- lations, and such a loud noise, from so small a thing, I had never seen or heard before. I halted and watched his antics. He seemed to be in distress, for he ran back and forth from me to the river a dozen times, when I concluded to see the cause of the distress. Accordingly, I dismounted, fastened my horse to a tree, and followed him to the bank of the river. "What was my surprise to see a beautiful lady clinging to a projecting rock, just above the rapids. Her position was a critical one: if her hold should be loosened she would be dashed to pieces in a moment's time. How to rescue her was my first thought. Being a good swimmer, I plunged at once into the river, and in a few minutes was by her side. I thought she was the most lovely girl I ever saw; or, at least, methought her face and rounded arms were the most charming-for the cruel waters covered her to the neck. She had been in bathing, and, having got'too far out in the current, had been swept down. And-and--but the truth will out, ladies-her clothes were all on the bank. O! the tears and blushes of the half- drowned, frightened thing! I believe, from the way she turned from me, that she would rather have died than that I should touch her. But that was no time for nice feelings. I encircled her waist with one arm, and swam--you needn't titter and blush so, ladies--I didn't swim ashore, but left her in the eddy water, brought her clothes and laid them on the bank, and then mounted my horse and galloped off at the top of my speed, like St, Augustine fleeing .frn temptation."

THE SAVAGES. "AARON V. BROWN! Aaron V., Brown 1" "Hilloa, Major, what's up?" "Why, the sun is up." "No matter for that; it's his daily business to get up; as for me, I'd rather lie abed, for I feel fatigued, lazy, dull, and heavy, sir, as an old log." "Why so--are you ill?" "No, sir! It was caused by that confounded wine I drank last night." "Ay, ay, boy; many a one has been wrecked just there  -ruined, lost! Confounded wine! ah! but it's the devil's own invention. However, a glass of good wine is very consoling and exhilerating at times. I love it with all my h eart; but then one should never let it grow upon him and drink to excess, for then, in that case, it 'biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.' I've a great mind to give you a temperance lecture, and show you the effects of such indulgences, but I fear it would be an old and hack- neyed theme, as it is ' dull and tedius as a thrice-told tale to the ears of a drowsy man.' " "Do give me a disquisition, Major," replied I, in answer to his remark, hoping thereby to gain another hour to lie and doze and dream and luxuriate on my downy mattress. But, as Mr. Peter Root was wont to remark, " the sar.   AMERICAN NIGHTS'  ENTERTAINMENTS.      157 mint was sarchin;" it cut like a two-edged sword, and I writhed under the stunning truths emitted from the rebuk- ing lips, and never once thought of sleep. But listen to him: "Indulgence in ardent spirits, my boy, is nothing more nor less than servitude, downright slavery. Under its seducing power man relinquishes humanity and acquires the character of a demon. His passions and lusts are inflamed, his reason dethroned, his intellect withered, his conscience seared, his heart benumbed.  He loses all self-respect, and is alike indifferent to the good or bad opinions of his fellow-men, and will sacrifice his body, his soul, his prop- erty, his character in the gulf of ruin. His natural affec- tions for his family are lost, and he beholds, with an unpity- ing eye, all who are near and dear to him come to want; -------"He sacrifices ease, peace, Truth, faith, integrity, good conscience, friends, Love, charity, benevolence, and all o The sweet and tender sympathies of life; To give him what? an hour of dreaming joy.' "Such, my boy, is the slave of intemperance. The mind is equally affected with the body, the principles, the morals. Loss of memory is occasioned, contraction, bluntness, defi- ciency of intellect, lack of energy, and depression of spirits; indeed, the mind approaches to idiocy, becomes weak, fickle, and overspread by an universal languor. When all these evils come upon him, when he becomes a perfect sot, he may look back and review his career, opportunities neglected, hours misspent, faculties unimproved; and when this wondrous life of more wondrous opportunities and awful advantages is over-C-when his three-score years and ten have fled-when mortal existence, with its facilities for personal improvement and servicableness to others is gone beyond recall-he may look back, then, with grief, with anguish, to the long, unprofitable pilgrimage just passed, i- I14     158    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. with all the doors of hope and influence closed upon him forever. Ah! what a retrospect! The fate of the trans- gressor is hard. His mind wanders, and returns once more to the sunny spot of his youth--its halcyon hours, its halo of raptures, its flashes of joy, its aspirations, its buoyant hopes, its innocence, its purity, and undying love-all ' flash for a moment across his phrenzied soul like the sha- dow of an angel's wing;' but for him they are gone, forever gone. They flash but in mockery. "Turn we, now, to another picture-the exit of the tem- perate man: it f Sure, his last end is peace; Night dews fall not more calmly to the ground, Nor weary, worn-out winds expire so soft, Behold him in the eventide of life- A life well spent!

"Come in-come in! an' the de'il be wi' you for the un- timely disturbance." The servant made his appearance with a public journal for the Major. "The postman, massa, arribed in de night, and here is de package missus sent up wid her compliments. She said dar was good news in it." The Major scanned it over a moment, and then began reading as follows: "At the State Convention held in Columbia, on the 16th inst., we are gratified to learn that Major William Aiken   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    159 was unanimously nominated the democratic candidate for Governor of the State. The whole South will be gratified to learn this, for Major Aiken is a true type of the South- ern gentleman, Southern to the core. He is an able politi- cian. He has a military reputation second to none in the State, which will have a great bearing in elevating him to the Chief Magistracy of the Commonwealth. He is well versed in politics, having a profound knowledge of all ques- tions of State and National policy, being well read in the affairs of the nation and deeply experienced by long ser- vice in public life; all of which, point to him as the stand- ard bearer of the democracy of the South. And who would * wish a nobler, purer, a more competent man than Major Aiket, the " long tried statesman," the hero of many a bat- tle-field?

"Humph!" muttered the Major, as he read the an- nouncement, "this is flattery personified; still, it is grati. fying, withal. I should be proud to be the Governor of the Palmetto State.  Glad--glad! If such an event should occur, you, my son, shall be my private secretary. Note this down in your mem.; I appoint you in advance. But let us down to the festive board; my nasal organs are even now tickled with the odors of the savory viands below." We descended to the breakfast room, and were greeted by all the company with expressions of gratification at the - new honors about to be conferred upon the Major. "The only thought that troubles me is that I must soon I enter the political arena on the duties of the canvass, and     160   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. will be compelled to part with my dear young travelling companion. I would much rather wander with him in these mountain fastnesses in search of adventures. By the way, Grandfather Hayne, these thoughts remind me of the prom- ised narrative of last night." 1' True! true! Major, I will spin the yarn with pleasure. I can always eat with better zest when talking or listen- ing; but methinks, my dear sir, you say but little about that political preferment of yours in expectancy, and 'wear your blushing honors meekly.' Egad! sir, you take it as an everyday occurrence, or, rather, as if you not only expect- ed, but had an incontrovertable right to the nomination; eh, Maior?" " You err, my dear sir, in all the premises. In the first place, I feel rejoiced at the preference of my good friends, and regret only my unworthiness and inability to discharge the duties of that high and responsible station. But why- why," murmured the Major, as if to himself, " why should I rejoice? I am an old man now, the sands of life will soon run out. I have no offspring--no gentle wife to gratify, to rejoice at mly success-none to love--none! none! What have I to live for? I care not for the honors, and as for emoluments, I am rich, wealthy as heart could wish. But you smile, Brown, and think, no doubt, that I belie myself; for I know -you are thinking of the expression I made just before I preached that memorable sermon, the other even- ing, to my good mountain friends. I would fain do good to my kind; I would fain fulfil my destiny on earth, discharg. ing truly my duties both to God and man. Ever since I laid my wife beneath the green sod, I've been a lone, sad wanderer-have lost my energy, my buoyancy of spirits, my desire for life, and long to be at rest, close by her side, down beneath the green sod of the valley. I feel, ah, yes! I feel   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     161 "' That life is but a torrid day, Parched by the wind and sun; And death the calm, cool night, When the weary day is done.' But these are sad, sad thoughts on this bright sunny morn, and in this gay assembly. Pray excuse them, ladies and gentlemen--xthe croakings of an old man who has seen much sorrow, lost all his kindred, and all that he loved on earth; who has to wander about over the world, seeking new scenes, new associations and excitement as a balm to the weary soul. But the story, good Father Hayne--pray re- gale us now with some of your heroic deeds and hairbreadth 'scapes, of which I have heard somewhat ere now. As to your doughty deeds in the Senate of the Capitol of the United States, they are matters of history, and familiar to us all. It is not of your prowess there, but of your bor- der scenes." And, after a preliminary hem, and a sip or two at his chocolate, Senator Hayne related the following, which will be found under head-- Kindness for Kindness. I was but twenty years of age," began the veteran, "when the events I am now about to relate occurred. It was at a period pregnant with danger. The father, before a- retiring at night, bolted and barred his doors, examined his cutlass and matchlock, not knowing at what moment he would be called to use them. The mother hung upon the lips of her children, not knowing but that it was for the last time. For every day our ears were greeted with the sad tale of the death of a father, mother or sister, by the ruthless hand of the savage. The Indians, at the time of which I speak, were overrunning the country, burning and devastating houses and property, and murdering or making -captives the inhabitants.     162    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. "It was towards the close of a cold, raw day, in Decem- ber," continued the grandfather, "that I mounted my horse at the only inn in the small village of Greeneville, but at that time the principal town in the State, and cantered off at a brisk pace, for I had near twenty miles to go over mountains, through tall forests and rugged wilds, ere I reached the precincts of my father's peaceful homestead. I had not gone more than half way when night drew on, and with it came snow and sleet. The night became exceedingly dark; the heavy clouds rolled over in huge masses; the wind blew a hurricane, causing the trees to howl and roar as if the very spirits of darkness were let loose. But, nevertheless, I gave my horse the rein and pressed forward; for I had many miles yet to go ere I reached my own comfortable fireside. '"Thus had I proceeded for nearly an hour, when the storm began to subside: the winds ceased their raging, and the moon-a joyful sight to me, indeed-peered forth from behind the dark clouds, and with her gentle smiles lit up my way through the wilderness. I began congratulating myself, and rubbing my frozen hands with glee, thinking that I would soon be seated, with my parents, brothers, and sisters, around the warm, cheerful fireside. My horse, also, gathering new life, pushed forward: but we had scarcely gone a mile before I was startled by a low, whining moan. As I drew in to listen, an indescribable feeling of fear crept over me, for not a human being lived within five miles of the place. "I litsened, but not a sound was to be heard save the low wail of the wind, the lapping of the trees together, and the howling of the ferocious wolves. Thinking it was but the creaking of some tree, or a creation of the imagination, I was again about to press forward, when the sound of a human voice could be distinctly heard'. I turned my horse's   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     163 head, and, following the sound as it quivered on the fir, in a moment I reached the spot from whence the noise issued, and perceived, by the foot pf an overhanging rock, a por- tion of a garment fluttering in the wind. I immediately dismounted and approached it, and beheld, to my great astonishment, a beautiful little Indian girl crouched down between two stones, apparently freezing to death. "What an affecting sight to see such a frail flower in a dark and desolate forest, where the bravest would not have dared to tarry, for the wild beasts were the undisputed masters of these woods. She was a beautiful girl, just emerging into her teens. I spoke kindly to her, but she was unable to speak, for she had suffered severely with cold and hunger.  I clasped her little hands in mine, but they were cold and stiff. She raised her dark, flashing eyes, but now melted into tears, to mine, and they spoke volumes. I then raised her tenderly in my arms, placed her before me on the horse, and, as we proceeded homeward in a brisk canter, the little 'flower of the forest' nestled closely to my bosom.   Onward, onward we proceeded, over hill and dale, until we arrived safely within some two hundred yards of my home.   We had but another scope of woods to pass, and it would be in sight. But, just as we gained the wood, my horse started, and, with a wild snort, reared several times in the air, as if frightened at some object before us. I looked forward, and saw several objects flit across my  pathway. "In a moment I was surrounded by about twenty Indians; and, before I  could speak, a large, fierce-looking Indian seized my   horse's head, while another caught me by the throat, and would, in an instant, have hurled me to the earth and  crushed me as a viper, had not the little girl cried out, after a second effort to speak, ' Wan-de o'alioo, o'ahoo!' Instantly the Indian released me and staggered     164    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. back some paces, as if thunder-struck at what he heard and saw. "'The little girl recovered sufficiently to relate to the Indian, who appeared to be her father, and the chief of the tribe, the circumstance of the adventure. I understood not what the fair flower was saying, but perceived plainly, from the countenances of the Indians, that she was speak- ing favorably of me; for their fierce frowns had vanished, and they looked kindly on me. "When she had ceased speaking, her father turned round to two of his followers, who appeared to be intoxi- cated, and shook 'his clenched fists at them, while the fire seemed to flash from his eyes: then, turning to me, in a calm, mild manner, he spoke in my language, and said he was grateful to me for saving his daughter. He had placed her in the care of the two Indians just mentioned, who had become intoxicated and forgotten her, and left her where they last encamped. He then ordered the two recreants to be severely punished; but the girl, as well as myself, entreated him to forgive them, which he freely did, as he said he was under obligations to them for services rendered on a former occasion. "'White man,' cried the chief, again turning to me, 'me under obligations to you, but me no remain under obli- gations to a white man. He is bad, bad, because he is cru'el; for he came from the waters afar off and murdered our people. He take our lands from us; he give us wild- fire to drink; and shall we, as the wild deer, flee at the white man's approach? No-no! We'll be as the bears, pierce, and we will bite.

You have   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    165 been kind to the Indian; you spared my daughter's life; I spare you. Go now, I bid you, and tell the pale-faces an Indian never forgets a kindness or a wrong.' "I then gave up my precious burden and went on my way rejoicing, for I had saved the Indian girl, myself, and my parents, from an untimely death." "That was truly an adventure," observed the Major, when the senator had concluded his reminiscence. "I could ' a tale unfold' similar to that, myself, had I time; but the day is advancing with a sturdy pace; and though I am loth to leave such good company, yet, Brown, my boy, we must now 'o'er the hills and far away.' There's no rest for the wicked, so we'll e'en depart; and, as we do so, we'll take the parting glass, salute the ladies with a kiss, shake hands with the gentlemen, and exclaim to the com- pany all, in the language of my ancient friend Horace, 1Vune vale!'" f     T V     E  T H N I GH T.          r VEDDER'S STORY. "How beautiful! how beautiful!" exclaimed the Major, i as we galloped down the avenue in front of the planter's, to the highway leading to Hamburg. "What is so beautiful, Major, as to cause you thus to dissolve into exstacies? My landlord's daughter, eh?"; "Yes, yes, she is charming; but it was not her rosy   ] cheeks I alluded to; it was the beautiful scenery, sir. Behold the broad acres of Indian maize; the rippling  f: stream; the white clouds, and the blue mountains in the  1 distance! How it elevates the mind, and raises it in lofty ? abstraction above the trivial things of earth! There is a t1 charm connected with this beauty and magnificence that in  a moment's reflection kindles the imagination and carries  the spirit at once into the bosom of its greatness and e grandeur.  How grand, how majestic, how glorious is the ; i work of God's hand! All, everything calls forth admira-  tion, for everything is beautiful and sublime.

All are beautiful and magnificent. And the mountains, with their gray and lofty heads peering up into the rugged clouds, which are tumul- tuously whirling around their lofty summits, where the eagle alone makes his eyrie, where the lightnings play, the storm raves, and the thunders roll. How the mind is filled with their vastness, and possessed and absorbed by all this awful magnificence of their scenery and character.  Wild wastes, fearful precipices, and towering rocks, unfathoma- ble chasms, the cloud, the avalanche, the freshet, and the roar of heaven's artillery, are all sublime.

"You talk, Major, like a good Christian. But this morn- ng your conversation was somewhat different.

But who have we here?" exclaimed he, as a middle aged gentleman cantered up from a cross road and joined us. "Ah! if it isn't my old friend Vedder." After the Major presented his acquaintance to me, and passed the usual civilities and courtesies of the day, he abruptly exclaimed,-"Why, Vedder, why is it that you are still a bachelor? A man of your appearance, habits, station and fortune, can have no excuse for acting the drone; besides, your illustrious ancestors who've slept some twenty years in the Catskill mountains laid down no such prece- dent; tell me, friend mine." "Why, Major, I have a very good excuse. The ladies I can get the devil wouldn't have; and the ladies I want, I can't get." "' Tut, tut, man, you have a better excuse than that. I have a faint recollection of hearing something of- it many years ago. Tell it me; I see my friend Brown is all anxiety, for he himself contemplates marrying, soon. Out with it, Vedder; out with it." "Well, sir, well! ahem, I will proceed to ' unfold the tale. ' " VEDDER'S STORY. "Ten years ago found me in my senior year at Trinity College, in the town of Washington, situated on the Atlantic coast in North Carolina. I had not this sprinkling of grey hairs then, which I have now, nor this furrowed brow : on the contrary I was a lively, hearty, robust, and by many called an extremely handsome young man; of the correct- ness of which you may well judge by my fine appearance -ahem! The town, though none of the largest, contained many a gentle maid, whose pleasing society tended greatly   to relieve the dull routine of constant study, the sameness and ennui incident to college life. And the retrospect is ;   generally pleasing; yet, not without its alloy; there is a dark, a damning cloud in the latter part of the reminiscence which has embittered my whole life, and almost made me a confirmed bachelor. The world deems me a happy man; would it were so. I ever try to be cheerful, yet, "There is that within which passeth show."' "But to proceed. Towards the close of the college year there arrived a polished lady from Tennessee, on a visit to her uncle, Prof. B. She was a lovely creature indeed. Language is inadequate to portray her many charms and graces. Let it suffice she was to me, at least, an angel upon earth. And the consequence was, I became deeply smitten. Deeply, ah, madly.  I was her constant compan- ion through the day, and at night, also, in my dreams. We danced, we rode, we strolled and talked sentiment together as the most intimate companions; I persevered-was suc- cessful-was her accepted suitor-and-the happiest man in all America. The good gossips of Wilmington had much food in our coming union) prospects, &c., on which to descant.  But the matter was soon forgotten in another and more impor- it ltant one; the arrival of a distinguished stranger, Count Willie 0. Seay, of la belle France. Ah! you smile, antici- pating me, doubtless, thinking him some imposter, who with his jewels, suavity of manners, titles and estates, supplants me, woos, wins and carries off my lady-love, and so on, and et cetera, as Bulwer, Cooper, Scottand other novelists hath it. It is partly so; but he was in truth a bona-fide gentleman of great wealth, and known personally by our good old professor.  Yet he was a consummate villain; a male coquette; a butterfly flitting here and there over the earth wherever sweets were to be sipped, let who might be 15    170   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. the sufferers. Added to his polished manners, his titles and estates, he was of a fine and noble appearance, and were it not for his piercing eyes and the sinister expression of his mouth, he would have been pronounced the hand- somest man in Carolina. This person, for gentleman I could not call him, situated as he was with the professor, soon became intimate with Laura Somerville, my betrothed. He was ever by her side; sang, played the piano, guitar, and harp, danced, strolled, and prated French with her; and was, in short, in a fine way to supplant me. I sought an explanation, but she avoided me; and, in consequence, I became an almost distracted man. "Matters stood thus when a party of us resolved to take a pleasure trip to Livingston, a small village about sixty miles distant, in the brig Mary McCarty. The party con- . sisted of ten gentlemen and ladies, including in the number - the Count and Miss Somerville. I aspired to be her escort, but no! she " could not think of offending his lordship, the 'y dear Count;" so, on a bright morning in July we embarked;  and as the noble vessel wended her way proudly out into  the ocean, all seemed to be merriment and glee on board, yet not a more disconsolate and miserable man than myself   ever sailed on the seas. Deceived, slighted, wronged, ; laughed at and treated with scorn and contempt by one : whom I adored, I placed myself on the gunwale in the aft ! part of the ship, and leaning my head upon my hands, I mused with fierce bitterness over my sad fortune. The cares and vanities of the world, the variableness, heartless- ness and fickleness of rwoman made me then and there  . resolve, that in future I would ever keep aloof from her wiles and snares. 'C In the meanwhile all was merriment on the fore deck. The song, the jest, and laughter resounded through the ship; and merrier than the merriest were the count and ;i   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     171 my faithless mistress. But their happiness to me was misery and mockery. I had remained thus near an hour, when I was startled by a wild scream from Miss Somerville. Springing to my feet, I had but time to see her little sister,  whom she had brought along, fall headlong into the waves. SeiZing the arm of the Count Seay, she cried in despairing accents, ' Quick! save, oh, save my sister?' and pulled him frantically to the ship's side. But he drew back exclaim- ing, ' excuse me, my pretty love, my life is too valuable to be risked thus; besides, succor is vain.' "Coward!" exclaimed the maiden, casting on him a look of the most withering contempt. "' Coward did you say? ah! that's funny. Think only of a nobleman, with a thousand vassals, risking his life to please a little plebian girl, because, forsooth, he has had a little flirtation with her." "But the maiden paused not to cavil with the popinjay; for at this moment the child was thrown up upon a huge wave.  With another scream she plunged in after it, and quick as thought I sprang after her. The waves rolled over me, and I sank down, down, many feet into the ocean ; it seemed as though I would never rise ; but as I began the ascent a heavy substance was dashed against me; I seized it, and found, to my inexpressible joy, it was the lady, who to my surprise, held, clasped in her arms, the now almost lifeless child. In a moment I had placed them in a boat which had been put out to our aid, and in another we were safe on deck. No sooner were we hoisted up than the most deafening  shout burst forth simultaneously from crew and passengers,   B and with gladdened and overflowing hearts we were greeted by the admiring crowd.  More gratified, grateful and bois- terous than all beside, was Count Seay. He now pressed eagerly forward to greet and congratulate the daring lady -     172    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. on her noble deed and narrow escape. But, drawing back she refused his proffered hand, and turned from him with a look of scorn and contempt; telling him, at the same time, to begone from her presence ; that she wished not the smiles and congratulations of a cowardly, contemptible fop like him, who would stand by and see a fellow creature suffer death for want of a little assistance; and, more particularly b see one risk her life, or even perish, for whom he professed such great and undying regard. And turning hurriedly from the admiring and approving crowd, she sought me out in the captain's cabin, whither I had betaken myself to change my saturated dress. "Springing forward, she threw herself into my arms, and with streaming eyes begged me to forgive her; although she had wronged me, yet she loved me still, and me alone. She implored me to take her again into my affections; and even sank upon her knees to give force and effect to her prayers. But it was too late. I told her she had wronged me, slighted me, deceived me, and all in one month after we had plighted our troth. When would our love grow   ; warmer, brighter, stronger? How could I put confidence in i. such an one? Go!' I vehemently exclaimed, ' to your  dear Count; he loves you to distraction, for he told you so not an hour past ; and besides, your name will sound much l prettier as Countess de Seay, than plain Mrs. Nicholas Vedder. Go, for I can't put confidence longer in one so z variable, deceptive, coquettish and vascilating. Yet, still Laura, I love you as ever; but ere I risk my happiness with one so changeable, I must have proof of your sincerity. If, after the expiration of ten years from to-day, I find you still single, still faithful, then, and then only, will I claim you as my bride. I wish your love, not your gratitude; a strong, deep, abiding affection. Farewell Laura, and re-  member----"But she had already swooned away and sank  '         "      i;i   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     173 helpless at my feet. But I was not to be moved from my purpose, so I stalked resolutely out upon deck, hailed a* boat, passing at the time, shipped my passage, returned to Wilmington, settled up my little affairs, and set out the same evening for a distant land. Ten years have passed since then, with its cares, temptations, trials, afflictions and changes; ten years, with the exception of one week, have slipped away, and I have never seen her since. She now resides in Pittsburg, and rumor tells me she is still single, still beautiful; that scores of wealthy, talented, and ad- miring suitors have been rejected by her ; that the world marvels much, and speculates a vast deal; but I alone of all know the secret; and I'll now, Major Aiken, impart to you, that slhe is still true to her first love. In one week the probation will be over.  God-send it were over now! But this day week the wedding takes place; and I now invite  you both, gentlemen, to be present on that occasion, to  witness my happiness, and to act in the capacity of grooms- men.     174   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.

The boom of a thousand cannons  went out from Madrid on the stillness of the night, and .i: echoed from hilltop and mountain side, the announcement i that the king was master and the people slaves. The j.:  palace of Toledo was one vast blaze of light streaming out : from three hundred windows-the fashion, the elite, the X nobility of the empire was there, and all was feasting and a revelry. The night had far advanced when one of the i king's staffs, advancing through the glittering crowd, bowed!f before the throne, and announced a stranger knight." a   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    175 ' Ha! De Joinville turned page, eh?" cried the king. "Methinks other business would beseem thee better. But who is it that dares to intrude upon me now with business?" "He would not give his name, your Majesty. No one else would announce for fear of displeasing you; and, as his business is urgent, and he such a stern, dignified and polished personage, I could not refrain from announcing him myself, though at the risk of offending your Majesty." ' Well, then, tell him to send his name immediately." The conversation had attracted the attention of the whole house, which had become perfectly still. "The knight, your Majesty, refuses to send his name; he says his business is urgent, very urgent, and that he has no time to spend in idle formality!" "S'death! And who is it that dares to beard me thus in my own palace?" A slight scuffle and an angry word or two was heard, when a tall, athletic young man, pushing his way through the guard at the door, entered, and stood bowing before the enraged monarch. "And who are you, fellow?" thundered the enraged  monarch."            ' "Who am I? why, I am gentleman enough to speak respectfully to my greatest enemy; aye, the veriest slave." "Beware! beware, slave! Tell me thy name, or I'll even try thee on the rack. Ho, there! guard."i "I fear not your rack, king; but I'll tell thee, at all events. I am one whose lands and castles thou hast confis- cated and given to thy creatures. I am the Marquis Denia." "'Ha! traitor, I have thee then at last. I'm in luck. Congratulate me, Marquis. Ten thousand pounds I offered  for thy head are saved. I will only be out a few shillings, which will be the hangman's fee."     :     176   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. "Silence! I came not here to cavil. I never harmed you, king, either in word or action. I have been absent in foreign lands for the last year, and knew nothing of the unholy war; but had I been here, sirrah, your success would not have been so great. I come, sir king, to fore- warn thee of danger which even now may blow thee into  perdition. I learned accidentally this night, about forty miles hence, that a keg of gunpowder had been placed under thy throne, where you now sit, by some deadly enemy t  whom thou hast injured-the slow match of which I doubt ;: not is even now burning closer, and--"  With one fearful bound and an angry oath the king fled ? to the farthest extremity of the apartment, followed, pell- . mell, by the whole house.                 The gilt staging was torn down by the king's orders,   disclosing the keg, and the entire match consumed with the . exception of one inch. The greatest excitement prevailed. When the confusion had somewhat subsided, the Marquis drew himself up and commanded the king to stand before him, which, without a question, he did. "Since my return to my unhappy country," began the Marquis, " which was but a day or two since, I learned that you had your child, .your only daughter, either slain or stolen from you a few weeks ago, and that you had gone almost beside yourself in consequence-it would have been ; well for the country, sir king, if you had."      A "What of her? Speak! in God's name, sir knight!"   : "Well, sir king, ten days ago I breakfasted in Bayonne,  in France, on my return home. About noon of the same  day, as I neared the Pyrennes, I passed a gipsey encamp- ment; I had not more than passed out of sight, when a mean, villainous looking man, belonging to the tribe just passed, came stealing up behind me, casting ever and anon fearful glances behind him. He held in his arms a lit-   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    1" tie child which .he proposed to sell me. The child was richly dressed, and I knew from the character of the tribe that the child was stolen; therefore I purchased it. The man said he had stolen it from his tribe, but that they had first stolen it from Spain." "Oh heavens!" groaned the king, "My child! my child!" "'Bring the child hither, Pierre," cried the Marquis, turning towards his servant, who stood at the entrance with the child. The king rushed forward and tore the cloak from around it. On recognizing his child he shouted aloud for joy, and embraced, alternately, the child and the knight. When his feelings had somewhat subsided he turned to the knight and said, in a loud voice, "Know all men, nobles and commoners, and bear me witness, all ye, that are present, that I give back to the Marquis Denia his lands and castles, his rights, his privi- leges, and his titles as a nobleman, together with a pension of ten thousand pounds per annum." "Not so, sir king; I'll take back my lands and castles as my rights, but no pension will I take of thee." "Know, then, and proclaim it, that I give back to the Marquis Denia his castles, lands, rights, and privileges, with the extra privilege of abusing me where and whenever he liketh. De Joinville, escort the Marquis to the castle, and proclaim this my proclamation." "Good, good," cried I, at the recital. "You, Major, as well as Mr. Vedder, have told each a story, setting forth the virtues of the brave heart, and the excellences of moral courage; I shall now, with your permission, recount a lit- tle incident showing up the ill consequences of the want of it. The story was related to me a few months ago, by the Hon. N. G. Taylor, of my native state; and I, too, will     L o   AMMERtCAIN INIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  give the story as near as I can in his own language, arro- gating to myself, however, the right to head it with the following title: Estrangement and Reconciliation. 6 My father was a kind old man, indulgent even to my faults. He reared me with all the tenderness of a mother, at least let me guess so, for I never knew a mother's love. She died when I was a child. I grew up to my teens in the sunshine of my father's love, without a cloud, even, to dispel the happiness. But happiness will not always last, neither will a parent's love for a child, albeit a dozen pro- verbs to the contrary. In an evil hour my father married a second wife. She was a beautiful, flashy girl, just escap- ing from her teens. She was all love and smiles, all kind- ness and honey; but at the expiration of a twelvemonth, her kindness turned to hate, her honey to gall. And who was I ? I was a wayward boy, loving to love and to be loved. I was gentle, studious, delicate, and withal kind. The more attention, the more kindness my father showed me, the more I was hated and slighted by my step-mother. She gained complete mastery over my father; and, as he was getting old and weak, she estranged him also, by her arts and wiles. She cared for nothing but show and parade. Our otherwise quiet home was now ever crowded with com- pany, and balls, parties, etc., followed each other nightly. She but very seldom suffered my father or myself to join her gay friends. My father she nightly sent off to bed and his dotage, and I to my dark little lonesome room. This continued for a full year, when I was sent off to a neighboring town to school. Here I continued for nearly two years, when I received a message from home, announc- ing the illness of my father, and requesting my immediate presence.     AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  1   179 "With all possible speed I set out, for, with all his neglect I dearly loved my father. 'It wa dark when I arrived. My step-mother received me in the hall, and informed me very ceremoniously that my father was dead--that he had died the day previous, and that his corpse was then lying in state in the library. Grief and anger both raged within me.   I demanded sharply why she had not summoned me before. "' Mr. Malapert,' she angrily replied, ' don't put on any airs, sir; I sent when it suited me.' "'I wish no brawling at a time like this, madame,' I replied. 'Order me a light, that I may repair to the library to watch my father's corpse. I little expected such a greeting after so long an absence.' "' Dear me! quite a new-fledged gentleman.-I'll let you know, sir, I'm mistress here. I inherit the whole of my late husband's property, by his will, and I'll have no airs here, especially by paupers and beggars.' "I stayed to hear no more; but, snatching a light, I sought my father's bier, threw myself on the corpse, and wept burning tears of heartfelt sorrow. All that held me now to earth was gone. I felt alone, alone in the cold world now. Hours and hours I lay-there and wept. Towards morning I calmed myself, and rose to retire to bed. I bent over my father again before retiring, and pressed my hand upon his brow, when, oh God! it was warm and moist. I knelt down ;-oh, joy ! joy ! he breathes! he has returned to life ! He had been only in a death-trance.  Quick as thought I drew out my penknife and bled him freely; and then rubbed him from head to foot. In a few moments he opened his eyes, and held out his arms. I ran to his embrace, and long, long he held me pressed to his heart. He begged me to forgive his long neglect; said he was getting old and weak, and had been the dupe of his wife;     180   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS. that he had been led and driven by her, and had disinher- ited his son, but thanked God his eyes were now opened, that he had now regained his reason. He said that while sick he had been neglected, and that while in the trance he was conscious of everything that transpired around him. His heart sickened whence thought of a living death; and  oh! how he reproached himself when he heard his wife speaking of him as the ' old dotard,' and expressing her satisfaction that he was now out of the way. And oh!' v exclaimed my father, ' how my heart beat for joy when I heard your voice, and how I upbraided myself for my  : estrangement from you; and for disinheriting you I suf- fered all the torments of hell. I prayed that I might be  restored to life, so that I might repair the wrong ; and He  has heard me, and it shall be done. I will separate myself  from the demon that I've so long nestled in my bosom .' "I dispatched a servant after a physician, summoned  another to mry aid, and ere morning my father was sitting up in his arm-chair. My step mother I barred from the room, and told her we wanted not her assistance. "iMy father regained his health, and with it his reason. , He settled upon his wife a small annuity, cashed the resi-  due of his estate, and, in company with his now almost idolized son, came to Tennessee." Mr. Vedder now left us, and we jogged - silently along, the Major and I, each lost in his own reflections. Presently we emerged out of the wooded road nearly opposite to a stately mansion that towered up above the tall magnolias, like some noble castle. The Major straight- ened up with a spasmodic jerk from his stooping position, and gazed intently at the once, and stiil, magnificent edi-  fice. He passed his hand over his face a time or two,  heaved a deep sigh, drooped back into his, former position,  and in a low, sad, plaintive tone, without comment, (other - ^t   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        181  than to point his hand toward the building,) repeated the  following:  "Whien the stars are in the-sky, And the dew is on the flower, And the evening breezes lie, Hush'd to sleep in beauty's bower; When the silver moonbeams play W;th the wavelets of the sea, Then my thoughts are borne away With remembrances of theo-  With remembrances of thee,                   j And the dreams of past delight,  When beside the silent sea, Through the watches of the night, We beguiled the fleeting hour With the tales of olden time; Haunted halls and lady's bower  Tn the bright Ilotien climes, Tales of tournament and dance, Of warriors armed in proof With helment, plume and lance,  And the charger's ringing hoof,  Sweeping proudly o'er the plain To the festival of death: -  When arrows fell like rain On a tempest blasted heath. Thy young eyes would fill with tears As we conn'd the quaint romance, Fill'd with tales of broken spears On the plains of sunny France; And when the chosen knight Won the lady and her lands, Thou wouldst laugh with strange delight By the moonlight on the sands. And the mountains would give back That wild laughter to the sea, And the sea-the sea, alack! Was a fitting type of thee; 16     182     AMERICAN NIGHTS   ENTERTAINMBNT6. 'Twas a type of thy young life In its glory and its gloom, A type, in its hour of strife Of thy tempest-woven doom Oh who that saw thee sit By the moonlight on the shore, Thine eye with gladness lit, And thy young heart running o'er With pleasure, like a stream That dances in the sun, Would have thought thy life the dream Of a lost and loving one? There was revelry and mirth In thy father's stately hall,             - When they held around its hearth            ; Thy birthday festival; And they bound thy raven hair With a coronet of flowers, While music on the air Led the dance of merry hours. When they poured the sparkling wine           ; In the cup with mighty glee, And bade its billows shine W ith a triple health to thee;             Thy father's heart was light,             j? And thy mother's eye was dim             7j With the waters of delight      - As she kiss'd the beaded brim. Thrice five summer suns and three O'er thybhead in joy had past, And each one had shone for thee More brightly than the last; And no footstep in the dance Was lighter than thine own, No eye with happier glance In that festive circle shone. A twelve month pass'd away, But that hall was lonely now, And the clouds of sorrow lay On thy father's hoary brow;           !   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.         188 Thy mother slept in death, And the busy tongue of fame Had sullied with its breath The bright jewel of thy name. For the spoiler's tongue had sown In thy heart the seeds of lust, And his arts had overthrown Virtue's temple in the dust; With falsehood and deceit He deprived thee of thy crown, Then flung thee 'neath the feet Of the cold and heartless town. Then the loathing look of scorn On thy pallid cheek was cast, As thy feeble form was torn By the talons of the blast; While the demons of despair In thy breast held revelcy, And raged within their lair Like the waves of an angry sea. A cry from thy heart went up With a faint and fearful gasp, That death would dash the cup Of affliction from thy grasp; And a broken prayer was sped With joy's funereal chimes, That the hand of God would shed Its oblivion o'er thy crimes. But the cup pass'd not away Until, humbled to the earth, Like a bruised reed thou lay On thy father's lordly hearth; And his faint and feeble prayer With thine agony arose, As your tears were mingled there For a broken heart's repose. In the silence of the night, As ye knelt before the throne, And the stars with trembling light On your sorrows coldly shone,     184     AMERICAN NIGHTS'    ENTERTAINMENTS. Peace descended from above On thy tempest-riven breast, And the ministrants of love Hush'd the stormy waves to rest. 'Tis a sad and mournful tale, Yet I often con it o'er, As I woo the evening gale, By the ocean's silent shore; And a voice of other days, Of thy flower and faded leaf, Sings again the early lays Of thy glory and thy grief. But the music of its breath Hath a blessing and a power, For it tells nle that thy death Will but be thy triumph hour; And my heart is filled again With remembrances of thee, Not of misery and pain, But of rambles by the sea." "What mean you by that sad lament, Major?"I inquir- ed as I spurred up to his side.    He looked round almost      vacantly  at me, the tears streaming down his face, and        replied: "It is only a tribute to the once owner of that princely domain we have just passed.    But these thoughts are too melancholly for such a beautiful morn as this.   How    1 sweet the odors of the autumn flowers!" Sweet are the melodies of early morn!

No king,  nor power can usurp his rights, or invade his territory with impunity.   We do not enough appreciate its advantages, its blessings; we do not respect the profession.

"Agriculture in its slow and sober movements, teaches us economy, temperance and frugality. The prudent farmer looks unmoved upon the fickle goddess of fortune, as she sports with the feelings of those who flock to her temple, but pities the subjects of her waywardness. Few indeed are the instances in this country of a farmer's becoming insolvent, 2who has devoted his whole time and attention to the pursuits of his vocation, and been contented with its slow but sure gains. "The riches of a moment's growth, in a moment takes wings and fly away; but that competency which is the reward of honest industry travels with us to the grave; -and certainly if there ever was a country which held out induce- ments to the husbandman to exert his industry and enter- prise, it is this--the land of liberty and the abode of K freemen-our civil, political and religious rights secured to us by a government whose foundation rests upon the will of the people; and so long as that adamantine chain of unanimity which binds together the north and the south the east and the west, shall remain unbroken, it will continue to be "The land of the brave, and the home of the free." "To be a good husbandman one should be acquainted with all the multifarious duties belonging to the profession. The flowers even, should demand his care and consideration.

Books, H we have few, one might rather say none, which acquaint us   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    189 with the primitive fortunes of our race. Plain reading and writing, handy as we are at them now-a-days, are things of which the majority of men, taking the ages of the world : -- together, have known nothing. We speak not now of the old and somewhat arbitrary division of the barbarous and civilized; but the people that built the pyramids and the ! temples of Thebes, knew nothing of what we call reading and writing. Their hieroglyphics were in the hands of the priests, and besides were about as much of a popular science : as the integral and differential calculus at the present day; with the advantage in favor of the latter, that all who have the intellectual capacity to learn it, have the means, while the hieroglyphics, were its sacred mystery. The Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Persians, at the most flourishing periods of their politics, could not have had any other kind of writing. There is no proof of any thing among' them more commo- dious than the arrow headed character, of which the construction excludes every thing like a popular use. It may have served the purpose of religion and the state, and had been, perhaps associated with astronomical hieroglyph- ics, to record some observations of the heavenly bodies. No one who has ever looked at a Babylonian brick, or drawings of the Persepolitan ruins, can suppose, that it extended its use to the common purposes of life. But this is to speak of the most ancient days, and distant regions. The Trojan war had been fought, all the Grecian cities founded, and the laws of Lycurgus established, before the Greeks learned to read and write; and prose is so modern among them, that we can show the period of its origin. With the Romans, i:; as with the Etruscans before them, writing was a mysterious ; art, in the hands of the priests, till the intercourse between Greece and Rome was established. Nor is it probable, that in common life, any extensive use was, at any time, made of the art. In the middle ages of Europe it was still less     190    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS, practiced. Charlemagne himself was awkward at it, and  : set up schools, that his subjects might be better taught than ; their master. Even at the present day, if the human race - were to pass in review before us, for one who could read a book, there would be about ten to whom it would be sad waste of fair rags, That almost idolatrous preference, . therefore, which we give to written documents above all '  other means of information, has, as far as the oldest anti- quity is concerned, little foundation in justice, and is much ' to be deplored when it leads us to neglect more permanent documents of the history of our race. It is not in the form of books, that languages themselves are the best witnesses of the most remote antiquity. "The coincidence of the structure and vocabulary of lan- guages carries us much farther back, than any record they contain, for the reasons that the oldest records have perished, and still more, because men spoke long before they wrote, and ages on ages of speaking men, to whom writing in all its forms was unknown, transmitted their language to pos- terity. But language, in any application, is but one of the monuments that survive the transitory generations of men. - Their works and their institutions, their superstitions, and E their ceremonies, in various forms, outlive them; and it is not without example, that the lineaments of the face de- K scend, for thousands of years. Let men but make some progress in civilization, and they divide the starry heavens li into arbitrary signs, of which the tradition travels down to :  the latest posterity, which establishes a connexion between the Hindoo, the Egyptian, and the Greek, anterior to any other record of it, and leave a memorial in their lunar a houses and solar aspects, for ages after marble and paper : are alike reduced to dust. This observation had not escaped philosophers.

The operations of nature are no longer regarded with a mysterious dread, or as the capricious movements of a doubtful agent, or under the control of stellar influence, but as subject to fixed and unvaried laws, established by a benevolent Deity, and accommodated to the wants and the highest happiness of His sentient crea- tion. " Philosophers, too, have thrown aside their veil of mys- - tery, and have become the public teachers of mankind. They disclose the secrets of nature, and the manner in which they may be made subservient to the uses of life. ( They have interpreted the written scroll, which shines in : golden characters above our heads, not as a book of fate, :  which, like the hand-writing upon the wall, is full of terri- ble but unintelligible import, but as a chart, which kindly : serves to guide the wanderer upon the trackless ocean, or over the unknown desert, to his desired home. 17     194    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. "In consequence of this change in the character of sci- ence, in the disposition of its votaries, and the benefits it : has laid at the door of every man, prejudice against it has nearly ceased; we would say quite. but that there are still i? many who-receive its benefits without confessing their obli- gations-who yet look upon it as something of a useless t nature. And perhaps most men regard it as belonging to I the closet, the laboratory, or the lecture-room, rather than i the work-shop, the manufactory, or the field. "But though philosophers have hitherto been for the most part secluded fromn the common pursuits of life, and have made their attainment firom the study of books, or from private experiments, they are not the only men of : science. There are thousands, who call themselves practi- cal men, in distinction from men of science, who, in truth, derive all their merit from the science, which they have unknowingly united with their practical skill. It is for- ? gotten that every operation in the arts is really an experi- ment in philosophy, and as truly illustrative of some law of nature as any performed in the laboratory or lecture- room; and that every artist, who understands the reason of the operation, is so far a man of science. "The truth is, there is no art which is not so connected i with science, that it may expect important improvements  from scientific investigation; and there is perhaps no sci- , ence, which has not almost innumerable practical relations.  What knowledge, for examp2le, can be more useful to a cer- tain class of men, than mnechanice,-that science, which treats of the laws of moving bodies; their velocities, their  momenta, and their direction; of the nature of the various j moving forces ; the laws of their operation; the manner in ' which they are applied, and of the composition and direc- tion of forces. Without an acquaintance with this science, : how shall the mechanic accommodate the power of his  ' i   i'i'   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.      195 I  machine to the quantity of effect to be produced? How shall he adapt its parts so as to give it a free and easy  motion, and to obtain, with a given velocity in the power, X  a required velocity in the weight? How important to him,  I also, are the investigations of the philosophers concerning 'I' friction; of the laws by which it varies with the weights, or surfaces, or velocities, of moving bodies ; and the means i: of overcoming it. But valuable as is a knowledge of this science in all cases, to those who have the direction of X machinery, its value is doubled, or rather it becomes abso- g:lj lutely indispensable, when any new machine is to be con- structed, or an old one is to be adapted to some new pur- pose. It is then the only guide. It makes the mechanic understand the means by which his end is to be attained; and after his ingenuity has suggested a plan upon which his machine shall be constructed, it enables him to calcu- ? * late its power, and to ascertain, to a considerable degree of certainty, its value, without the loss of time, labor, and expense in experiment. How many times would this sci- ence, in this way, prevent the failures of ingenious men; how often would it prevent ingenuity being wasted to no purpose, in attempting to construct impossible machines, or in proceeding upon false principles. How often would it prevent the abandonment of a valuable design, by assisting the inventor to discover the impediments which hinder his success, or to make a more judicious application of his principle! How often would it enable the mechanic to make new applications of principles, which are developed in machines of attested excellence; and how many times would it suggest such simplifications of valuable but expen- sive machinery, as to facilitate its introduction into coun- tries, and its use by corporations of limited capital! "The mathematical sciences, too, are capable of appli- cations to useful purposes, to an extent almost as unlimited so     196   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. as the infinity of their own numbers, or as quantity itself. They embrace everything capable of being measured, and they are the foundations of all calculations. They aid the astronomer in investigating the laws which govern the rev- - olutions of the heavenly orbs, and to deduce from them all those principles, and to construct those tables which enable  the mariner to ascertain his situation, when he can see k nothing around him but the monotony of the dashing 1* waves, and to direct his bark to his distant and invisible home. "This earth, as we all know, is a round and firm globe, carrying upon its surface men and beasts. These, however, would soon perish, and the earth become void of inhabitants, if the means of preservation were not abundantly and con- veniently provided for them. By a beautiful providential arrangement of our Creator, the earth is endowed with a capacity to produce vegetable matter, fitted to sustain and preserve the beings which inhabit it; and this vegetable matter, in obedience to the law which governs it, remains permanently where it first grew; whilst to men and animals the power of sight and motion is given, to enable them to change their places in search of new food, and to perceive it when it is found. This capacity, which is in the earth, of producing vegetable matter, is not, strictly speaking, L contained solely within itself; because the action of the sun, i and of the air we breathe, is necessary to unfold it. A globe of solid iron would not, probably, acquire the prop- erty of producing abundance of vegetable matter by expo- sure to the sun and air; nor would a globe of rich vegeta- : ble mould, probably, possess that property, without their  influence. All the parts of creation depend harmoniously upon each other. The fertility of our earth depends upon the great luminary of our system; and the power of the sun, itself, may be derived from bodies extraneous to it; the I2 *    :i      -AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     197 chain of a dependence extending throughout the universe, I?  and ending only with Omnipotence. This property of pro- ::I  ducing vegetable matter, arises from the loose and friable materials upon the surface of the earth being acted upon -?:: by the combined influence of the sun and air. It is a fur-   ther providential arrangement, that all this vegetable and animal matter which is found on the surface of the earth, H$  when it comes to maturity, gradually decays and dies; and -J  the remains, if collected and returned into the bosom of the earth, are there, by the agency of heat and moisture, converted again into such elementary substances as are the proper food and sustenance of new organized plants. But this admirable providence does not end here: the elements of which all matter is formed, are, in this last stage, of a very light and evanescent nature, and, consequently, a very 1i  large portion, perhaps nearly the whole, of dead organized !!N bodies, from its levity, the exhalations of the sun, and the action of the wind, is carried far away from the surface of the earth, and apparently lost for the purposes of repro- duction. If this were true, the earth would be constantly dimiriishing in size, and its duration would be limited; but Omniscience has guarded the whole. The atmosphere which surrounds the earth is not only the salutory fountain of the air necessary to our existence, and to the existence of all organized forms, but it is a convenient receptacle for the light bodies which escape from the earth. The heavier particles which float in the atmosphere are brought down To: by fertilizing rains, and the more evanescent ones, which are exhaled by the hot beams of the sun, are, upon the set- ting of that luminary, condensed, and fall again by their own weight, with the kindly dews. Whatever falls upon the ocean is converted to the sustenance of its numerous inhabitants; and whatever is lodged on the highest moun- tains, is, by the agency of rain, washed into the valleys.     198    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  The vegetation which covers the face of the earth supports  the herbiverous beasts and insects, and they, in turn, sup- : port the carniverous class of animals. The varieties are innumerable, yet no one kind is permitted to increase be- yond its bounds. A check is found in the propensities of i the varieties themselves. Each, in its turn, lives its ap- pointed time, then docays and dies, and by its death forms materials for new forms of bodies. Thus the whole of this wonderfully economical system is perpetual in its nature,  so long as the Almighty hand that formed the universe is  pleased to continue it in its present relations. God, how- ever, in this, as in all his works, has abundantly provided his creatures with the means of carrying on His fair scheme  of creation, in a prosperous way. He has set good and evil, abundance and want, before us, and has left us free agents to choose between them. We may, if we please,  assist in the accomplishment of His intentions, by securing our comforts, and advancing the general interests of man- kind; and we may, if we please, run counter to his bene- volence ; yet the power we possess of distinguishing between i good and evil, infers that we are responsible to God fbr the  existence of that power. "Important, however, as are the physical conditions here  briefly and partially enumerated to the support and advance-  ment of the great art on which, not the comforts only, but the very existence of the human race mainly depend, still they are of secondary importance, and comparatively of little effect, when unassisted by those moral influences  which conspire to stimulate and to aid individual and social man in the pursuit of his own happiness, and in the promo- i tion of the general welfare of the species. Although, as A has already been observed, We theory of cultivating the earth has of late been brought nigh to perfection, yet the practical improvement of this art, in the absence of the   "5:er  AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     199 hi moral influences, just suggested, has made but little pro-   gress; for the condition of the husbandman has remained 1%g nearly the same. The Calmuk still wanders on the borders of the Wolga, covered with loathsome diseases, produced by the filth in A which he moves, and the half-rotten flesh on which he feeds; K : and is still exposed to lose his nose, his oars, or his thumbs gat the good pleasure of his chief. i The Hungarian peasant still coats his shirt with a layer of grease, to save a summer's washing--and sleeps abroad in the open air, with his cattle, or burrows at home, with his swine ; stationary or a vagabond, he is still a slave; and blesses the memory of Maria Theresa, for rescuing him from more than two dozen strokes with a cane, for mere insolent words to his master-and the mother of his children from more than the same number, for the same grave of- fence, with a switch. The vassal of Bohemia is still fixed to the soil, and trans- ferred with it and its title of nobility to 'the new Baron; for slavery and nobility are there, alike, vendible articles. The Nbrwegian still mixes in his bread the bark of trees; and the laborer of the fertile fields of Lombardy, while he reaps luxuriant harvests for a foreign master, is compelled to nourish himself, his wife, and his children on a coarse and scanty portion of polenta, savored perhaps, with a relish of garlic, or a few drops of rancid oil. ?  The farmers of Westphalia still smoke themselves and O their families, with their bacon, in a common apartment; j! and many  of the inlhabitants of the spot where once was j the garden of the Hesperides, seldom now taste bread, but  are obliged to rake, with their iron hooks, for a precarious meal, beneath the chestnut tree and the oak. The husband- men of Holstein, and of most parts of Germany, are A.     200    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        joint tenants, with cattle, of the same roof; and even the A cottagers of France are exposed in their comfortless, damp  and floorless cabins, to every species of disease and suffering.  Nay, England, who pretends to have coined the word comrn  fort for her own. exclusive use, still allows, in the midst of all her power, and her opulence, and her vaunted prosperity, a large portion of her laboring subjects to feed on private charity, or to depend for subsistence on public support; thus making the boasted birthright of an Englishman a mere title to "ask, at rich men's doors, a little bread," or to sue to a parish officer for a mess of pottage.' " To insure the practical improvement of Agriculture, a people must be civilized and free. The lone and defenceless savage will not till or plant the earth, when the fruits of his labor are exposed to the depre- dations of the first fellow savage stronger than himself, whom chance may lead to his encounter. Both the savage I and the slave, indeed, often look upon life itself as a fearful calamity; and sometimes seek to lighten its cares, or to circumscribe its miseries, even by the extinction of their own offspring.                     ! Civilization and freedom are, indeed, essential to the! prosperity of Agriculture. Without civilization, there can be no social security for the husbandman; and without freedom, ther e can be no competent incentive to his in- dustry. It was in vain that the modern Semiramis of the North, I in all her power, allured the Germans, and drove her serfs i to settle on the uncultivated wastes of her empire. The blast of despotism still howled through the desert, and there blighted the unsheltered germ of the plant, and palsied the unstrung arm of the cultivator. Not civilization, however, or even freedom, in its general   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     201 acceptation, can furnish the strongest moral incitement to the practical perfection of Agriculture. England and France have, for centuries, been considered highly civilized; and now, compared with Russia, are !  certainly free-but the equality of man, in both those countries, is at best but an abstract position, and the preju- dices and abuses of former ages still partially retain their ascendant. Mankind still continue, there, to be classed into distinct orders, and thence excited to pursue distinct inter- ests, and to indulge discordant passions. Not only the artificial inequality of political rank, but its necessary concomitant, the excessive inequality of real estate, the twin offspring of the violence and barbarism of darker ages, are there still felt, if they be not acknowledged. If the feudal relation of baron and vassal do not still exist there in name, many of its evils, in fact, with respect to Agricul- ture still survive, in the relation of landlord and tenant. The right of soil, both in England and France; is the exclusive inheritance of the few, while the soil itself is cultivated by the many, exposed to all the vexations and exactions, which ignorance and avarice and arrogance may impose on laborious skill and humble dependent industry. These evils are, even there, seen and deplored by the enlightened friends of Agriculture and humanity ; but they can propose no radical cure ; they indeed whisper liberality and compassion to deaf and obdurate landlords, and ask them in vain for the prolongation of their leases, and the diminution of their rents. It is not intended, by the recital of these things, to arouse the indigation here, or to excite a spirit of revolution or reform, for the amelioration of other nations; but while they are left " at liberty to manage their own affairs in their own way," we should not be unmindful of our just cause of exultation at the happier lot that has been assigned to us.     202    AMERICAN NIGHTS) ENTERTAINMENTS.       J However ungenerous we may consider our soil, or ungracious our climate-however truant we may have hitherto been in availing ourselves, to the full extent, of the physical means actually enjoyed to improve and to extend the great art of Agriculture, we have reason to be proud and to be grateful that we are denied none of those moral advantages which can excite or assist in carrying that art to its utmost limit and perfection. Now, a competency-neither poverty nor riches--is essen- tial to our happiness; so essential, that he who is married without the possession or prospect of it is a mad-man; and X waving all courtesy, the girl that would marry him is a fool; M and that as well whether he be in the possession of it with  habits likely to dissipate it, as when he is without either the possession or prospect of it. Their is no weighing, nor  measuring, nor counting the calamities incident to a desti- 5 tute and embarrassed condition. They press upon the  I breast of a man like an incubus; they obstruct the pulsa- tion of his heart; they deaden the current of his life; they wither all the beauties, with which nature would cheer him i by day and fancy beguile him by night; they are the ever present messenger of fresh and evil tidings. And nothing X but the reduction of a father to something less than human, i or his elevation to something more, can render such a state supportable. It is, therefore,'one of the highest duties and ought to be inculcated from the cradle up, as well upon those who are born to a competency, to maintain, as upon those who are not, to acquire it; for it is favorable to the  growth of all virtues and essential to domestic comfort. It is the little vase of earth in which your flowers and shrubs that are to ornament and embalm your firesides and sweet- en and cheer the intercourse and sympathies of husband, wife and children, are to grow and flourish. Is it not then worth a little self-denial, the doffing of an extra ribbon, and   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    203 another and another effort to accomplish it? Tell me, ye I who can recollect enough of the trifles you have thrown away as of nameless importance, and for which you were   not a whit the better, to wrap your children warm in flannel, to light up a cheerful fire in your own neat and comfortable dwellings, to spread your table with abundance of whole-  some food, and to cheer you, if sick, with the prospect that these blessings will continue and brighten upon you, without the aid, or at least without the reproof, of charity,--tell  me, is it not worth an effort?              a You recollect, that without extraordinary talent, industry  or economy we have nothing more to expect than a living. ,While, therefore, I have only time to urge you to IMPROVE. iMENT, without dwelling upon the means; and to redouble your DILIGENCE, without noticing wherein we are remiss; I will detain you for a moment, if you please, upon the subject of ECoNOMY-economy within your houses; economy in building them; and economy in one other particular. Economy is to industry, what the memory is to the mind --it retains for use. The great secret of making estates, lies in this. You have only to apply your arithmetic to the operation of compound interest, during a moderately long life, to be satisfied of this fact. A dollar expended at twenty-one, does not accurately denote the extent of your loss. You not only lose the dollar, but you lose many more, which without subjecting you to any trouble, it would ij have earned you. You grub up the measure of wheat which is well sown, and in a good soil, and which would u1  yield you, not merely one, but an annual, and perpetually increasing crop. Such considerations are more necessary, I think, for us A Agriculturists, than for men of any other profession; for none seem to have less power to bear up under actual adver- sity, or to meet, as they ought, the threatening approach     204    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. of it. The cause of this I do not pretend to explain; but the fact I have had frequent occasion to remark and lament. Is it that we are worse economists than other people; that from keeping no regular accounts, we more frequently live beyond our incomes; or that the means of our subsistence, being more liable to great and sudden fluctuations in price, we oftener experience the trying vicissitudes of abundance and scarcity in our pecuniary resources, than the individ- uals of other professions? An empty purse is a marvellous damper of the spirits, I believe, with all; but I know none ' upon whom it appears to have such an effect as on the planter and farmer. You may tell him, when in this woful predic-. ament, by his care-stricken and doleful visage, as far as you can see him. If his temper happens to be of the acid i kind, his countenance in a cheese-making dairy, might save all the expense of rennet in curdling the milk; but should his dispositiou be. of the milk-and-water character, all hypochondriacs should carefully shun him, as nothing would sooner bring on their customary fits of the blue- devils, than his looks. If I am right in the opinion, that the exertions of the agriculturist are more easily checked by any discouragement than those of other men, it is easy to explain why we have been so hard to rouse from the torpor under which we have labored for some years past. Agri- cultural products have fallen in price far below what they once were,; and although the obvious remedy for the incon- venience resulting from this very unpleasant state of things, was economy, yet few, or none, would adopt it, until they were forced. Abstemiousness in the use of money, is a virtue which most farmers find as much difficulty in prac- tising, as abstemiousness in food or drink; yet both are acknowledged to be of sovereign efficacy. In vain does the dietetick physician prescribe the last, in diseases of the body, and Dr. Prudence recommended the first, for diseases   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     205 of the purse; the irresolute, self-indulged, self-devoted patients turn a deaf ear to both, until Dr. Necessity, lays g his iron clutches on them; and then, alas! the abstinent "j!! course often comes too late. For instead of the manifold,  resolute, and persevering struggle, essential to the cure, which can be effected by nothing short of the timely and complete conquest of habits superinduced by pampered    appetites for luxurious food, raiment, or other pageantries;    the miserable victim of excessive indulgence becomes a querulous, moping, melancholy drone, incapable of almost any evidence of being alive, but sighs and groans. And wJhat are the mighty causes that produce such apparent complication of wo? Why truly, in most cases, (for few are il  so desperate, as to be altogether remediless,) because the conviction has at last been forced upon the reluctant con- 1^   vert to the necessity of economy, that the long impending hour has at last arrived, when country brandy and whisky must be substituted for imported spirit and wine; when extra super Saxon, and the finest Irish linen, must give place to homespun; when riding must be performed on horse back, instead of being in the costly carriage or gig; and when fewer ribbands, feathers, and other frippery must be purchased, for those who probably attach much less import- ance to them than he does. But is there a man who deserves the name that ought not to be utterly ashamed of such childish weakness? Is there a woman, who has the slightest claim to the admirable' character of a Virginia matron, that would not most cheerfully encounter any privation necessary for the good of her family; or who has ever neglected to inculcate similar principles on the minds of her daughters? I fully believe that there is not; nay more, I am thoroughly persuaded, that where econom- ical reforms become necessary-no matter from what cause, there are very few husbands who would set themselves 18     206    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. earnestly about them, but would not be met more than half S way by their wives. The chief reason why the latter are !J so often and so unjustly charged with the whole blame of wanting thrift, is, that the former too frequently prove 1 insincere in their proposals to adopt the saving plan; and :: when this is the case, the wives very naturally think-if ruin must come, that they have a right to commit their full portion of the waste. If the husband guzzles away a part : of his subsistence in places of idle resort, or spends it in t gambling, or in any other selfish indulgence; he has no right to be surprised, should his wife squander away all she can lay her hands upon in whatever may appear to her a ! gratification. For although it will prove but a poor excuse , in another world, for our culpable conduct in this, to say ^ that we have done wrong because we saw others do so; yet, in that most important and sacred of all human copartneries, f called marriage, faults in one party will almost always i provoke, if they do not extenuate them, in the other-for neither has a right to claim, that all the good examples necessary in both, should come solely from one side. A very foolish and almost destructive pride has frequently no small share in this business of mutual wastefulness-the individuals concerned, being more ashamed of reformation, i than of perseverance in extravagance. But surely, true honor, true morality, and true religion-all tell us, that the , nearest approach which human beings can make to perfec-  tion, is resolutely to correct our errors as soon as possible after we discover them. The classification of men in society is not arbitrary, but grows out of the nature of things. You may as well, therefore, attempt to change the immutable principles upon which society is founded, as to change the organization of it in this particular. You cannot do the one, without the other. Each department of industry, whether intellectual                      ;1 AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.        207 or corporeal, is filled, because there is something in it to be done, by which subsistence, or distinction, or both may be gained. This diversity of occupation forms classes, all governed by the same motive, and posting, with what ability AI  : they have, to the same results. Were you to take the fabric of the social state to pieces, therefore, it would make itself tip again in the same general form. As in every character so in every class, there are blemishes and defects, but much of the happiness of men results from magnifying X; the one and the other. And it will usually be found, that :  he who is most in fault, is most censorious; and that the IX same spirit, which kindles at the renown or elevation of another, would plant itself upon the crown of the arch of both, either by mounting to its height, or by levelling it to its capacity. There are lawyers who are the ornaments of their profession; others who are the disgrace of it. There are men of power and authority, who are-the benefactors of their country; others who are its scourge. There are men of fortune, whose riches give means to charity and influence [  to virtue, that are the golden spires that glitter upon the capitol of society--objects upon which the sun loves to shine and from which to reflect his own beams of munificent glory. There are others, on whom   Providence seems to have smiled ,and around whom to have scattered a profusion of temporal blessedness and all the radiance of temporal honors, who are nevertheless, an iron bound coast, from which a fellow creature, however he may have been shipwrecked in -= the storms of life, however much an object of pity and compassion and charity, had better keep off and trust him, self to the mercy of the elements-a coast upon which there is no life boat, and along which the passing mariner, what. ever tempests may beat upon him and whatever blackness of darkness may cover him, never ventures the signal of distress the second time. I might run through all the classes     208    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMBNTS.  in the circle of society and apply the same general remarks -  to individuals of each. You meet with farmers and me-  ! chanics who are conspicuously worthy, who adorn the   , station they occupy and would have adorned any other.-  : You meet with others, the circle of whose being is narrowed to self alone, and whose imagination, in its most playful and discursive flights, never ventures beyond it.    C But as we are all embarked in the same vessel, the  i; conclusion is, we have storms enough to encounter, and I! calamities to endure in this voyage of life, without mingling bitterness in each others cups, or infusing poison into each others comforts. We mar the incomparable beauty of our  - inheritance, by petty disputes and rivalries among ourselves- Run over the map of the world; you cannot select a spot more privileged than that which you occupy. We wish the i patriots of South America, of Spain, of Greece, success;  because we look forward to the time when they may enjoy what you now possess without limitation and may possess X without end. But, after they shall have gone through the struggle of right against wrong, of the people against power, they will hardly have improved their condition, until, by education and moral culture, they shall have formed the mass of population into a race of men, capable of under- standing their rights, as well as able to assert them. True, the convulsions of the revolution break up the- old founda- tions of despotism; lay open the unexplored recesses and dormitories and cells of superstition; and send the light i and air of truth and liberty through the dark domain of many centuries of mysterious and terrific power; and prepare the way, by thus rolling their scourge fiercely over the earth, for another and a better state of things; yet the time is far distant, when your sun will shine in their firma- ment; when the dues of your parochial, religious and civil institutions, will descend upon their mountains, and awaken   ::?X      AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.       209- into life the countless blessings and beauties of your free "and happy land.   Here you have perfect security for life, liberty and property.  Here, you have equal rights and equal honors.  He who will, may run the race and take the garland, or scale the heights and deck himself with the plumes of glory.  I would inspire you, therefore, with the deepest emotions of filial and grateful affection for your pilgrim fathers-these are the fruits of their toil; this is the land of their sepulture ; here all your hopes are anchored; and I would elevate you in adoration to HM who has mani- fested HIMSELF more distinctively, theirs and yours, than I to any other people on the earth.  O! it is a subject upon which I would dwell, and grow immortal as the theme. But I am admonished that I have passed the limits of the hour assigned me. There is a time, when friends must part." The Major having concluded his speech, amid the plaudits of the house, sang, before taking his seat, the accompany- ing song: "A Farmer's life's the life for me; I own I love it dearly, And every season, full of glee, I take its labor cheerily- To plough or sow, To reap or mow, Or in the barn to thrash, sir; All's one to me, I plainly see 'Twill bring me health and cash, sir.

FIFTEENTH NIGIT. I AT BREAKFAST. WE arose late next morning; breakfast we found was   j over, so we ordered our meal to our room.       i1 "Heigh-ho!' exclaimed the Major, as he sprang out of bed with the agility of a boy. ' I feel the vigor in me of a Sampson, but I am weak at heart."           i "Why, what's the matter now, Major?" "I am grieved that we will have to part so soon. I to the arduous duties of the gubernatorial canvass-you to your travels-but there's 'no sweet without the bitter.' But let us defer thinking (if we can) or talking about it till the evil hour arrives; let's be merry while we may. Do you recollect, boy, seeing that long, lean, rather distin- guished gentleman, that sat in the Reporter's box, and who gave me the huge boquet of flowers, at the meeting last night?" "Oh, yes, very well." "He is one of the most eloquent men, and the most accomplished orator in the nation. Colonel Landon Haynes has no superior, I verily believe, in the wide world. You would have to hear him once to fully appreciate his elo- quence. I listened to him some months ago in your own State, in the city of Nashville. I recollect distinctly, word for word, his closing speech, as I only arrived in time to hear part of it. It was an eulogy on our country, on-   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.      213 but I will give you his own language, as a specimen of     i genuine eloquence:                        "The discovery of America, in its practical bearings on the destinies of mankind, was equivalent to the creation of  i another planet beyond the seas for the habitation of man.    It brought into activity on the race a new combination of   I physical causes, which, in their final operation, shall lead to ! consequences, political, social, intellectual, and moral, grander than have yet occupied the thoughts or dazzled the minds of men. North America stands forth on our sphere, the centre figure among the continents, around which they are all     : grouped. On the one hand she lifts her front, set and glittering with cities, in the face of Europe; and, on the   :i other, turns her western slope, watered with rivers 'liter-  1 ally turbid with gold,' and crowned with eternal spring, in  : the broad vision of Asia. While between these extremes  lies an empire more than six thousand miles in its outline,  covered with the richest soils ever visited by the beams of the sun, and intersected by streams which pour their floods  through 'inland seas' to the great ocean. And, already, Science, in her azure robe, has taken her stand on the crest of the world, the summit of the Rocky Mountains; and gazing with dazzling eyes in the face of Asia, with a globe in one hand and a compass in the other, whose trembling needle, instinct with the pulsations of that wonderful vein of magnetic influence which throbs around the world, is pointing out to the millions of the West, the parallel of latitude on which the riches of the Earth are to find a high- way to the East. And, indeed, she is now beckoning into our Pacific ports the ' daring canvas' and flying steamer of every nation, from the wandering seas and distant transits around Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.  And yet     214    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.        our country is but in the germ of her greatness and the infancy of her years. In a century to come, at the regular rates of increase, she will contain a population of 500,000,000. It cannot be averted: for the general laws of the moral are as certain in their operations as those of the natural world. The Anglo-American race must eventually pour its wave of population over this continent. Its progress tn the past is the best augury for the future. Had any one in the time of the Confederation said that the handful of men then liv ing, and their descendants, in' fifty years would spread- to the Pacific Ocean, he would have been regarded as a run-mad enthusiast. But incredulity has been turned into faith, and fancy into fact. Is it less probable that this powerful and master race, within the next half-century, will have followed our eagles over all Central America? Already the pulse of the Anglo-American beats in Nicaragua. And what exists in our system to prevent its extension to the whole? It is totally unlike any other which ever ex- isted. In the checks and balances, concord and harmony of its 'embodied members,' it approaches more nearly to the Solar system, planned by God himself, than any other: for, like the planets, each revolving on its axis, while bound tTy the kindly law of gravitation to the central luminary, every State possessing a separate, distinct, and independ- ent government of her own, is, at the same time, bound with her sisters into a perfect Union, around the Federal Government, by the compact of the Constitution of the United States. The inference of dismemberment from territorial expan- sion, springs from the error of confounding our representa- tive Republic with pure-and primitive Democracies, and applying the reasonings drawn from the one to the other. The true distinction is, as Mr. Madison said, that in a rad-   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     215 ical Democracy the people meet and exercise the Govern- ment in person, in a representative Republic, by their agents. It follows, that the territorial limit of a pure Democracy is i that distance from a common centre which will barely allow  S the most remote citizens, as often as public exigencies de- mand, to come to the seat of Government, and that of a representative Republic that distance which will permit the Representatives of the people to come to the central point,  as often as necessary, without detriment to the public service.                           ! The application of the agency of steam to transit on land and water, and the employment of lightning for the trans- mission of intelligence, have endowed Government, man,    3 and the human mind, with a kind of earthly ubiquity,      which, in point of time and profitable effect, have brought  the utmost borders of this whole continent nearer to a con- mon centre, than were the limits of the old thirteen States to the seat of Government in the days of the Confederation.  Our double system of Government, State and Federal, in  practical influence and expansibility of its machinery, is  i capable of adjusting itself, as well to the whole, as to any of its segments. Whether such an extension ought ever to take place, and the time and methods by which it shall  be accomplished, if ever, are far different questions ; ques- tions which must be decided by you in your day and gene- ration, under a high sense of national justice, honor, and morality, when they shall arise.                i Discarding, however, in nature, all social distinctions springing from  the accidents of birth and fortune, and  founded on the intrinsic dignity of man, as man, our insti-  ! tutions know no aristocracy but that of virtue and intellect.  The equality of civil and religious privileges, and the gene- ral diffusion of political power among the people at large,  I by which every free man of the white race becomes an ele-   i i ^*i          '     '.; mJ     ment in our State and National sovereignties, have brought the patronage of the Government and the capacities of the people into contact, and furnished motives for high attain- ments in science, law, and political economy, unknown to the Monarchies and despotisms of the other hemisphere, founded as they are upon the interest of the few. And in  consequence of the indefinite number to whom the high  honors and dazzling rewards of our free country make their mighty depths of appeal, and whom they stir to mental  activity in their preparations for our ever-returning I Olym- pics,' our country is soon to be the ' brightest spot' on the  planet we inhabit, and in the empire of the mind, of letters,  and of eloquence, the first in the civilized world. Carry forward your minds, then, to that country which rises on the prophetic future. Consider the immensity of  her outline, itself a boundless image of liberty, crowded  with a dense and mighty people, belted with every degree of climate, reposing in the midst of the great oceans, and watered by a thousand rivers running to the seas. Behold her'fields spotted with flocks and herds, and crowned with purple harvests; checkered with electric wires and public works; studded with villas and cities, and ruled by the wisest government the world ever saw. Turn the radiant eye of contemplation to her beautiful seats of Art, where the genius of sculpture ' pours life, and soul, and passion' into the breathing marble, and the painter diffuses the beauty of the ' face divine' on the living canvas. Look at her academies colleges, and universities, thick as the stars. lighting the intellects of millions at their redundant foun- tains.

The same evening of the addressa I was introduced to him, and in the course of our interview he related to me the following Anecdote of General Sam. Houston.           A FEW winters ago, while traveling south, I halted late    a one evening at a village inn in northern Alabama, to spend r the night. Quite a company of travelers and village gos-    a sips were seated around the glowing fire in the bar-room1 19 - .. o f ..   ..       218   AMERICAN NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENTS. when I made my entre. I was soon seated in the midst of the motly assembly, and, during the interval employed by mine host in making certain demands on his larder for my , especial benefit, I listened to their chit-ch at. A vaunting,  self-important disciple of Blackstone was holding forth in an eloquent (?) tirade against religion and Christianity in : general. The circumstance was somewhat similar to one  ] in which Judge Marshal, of Va., figured while travelling X through the western portion of the "Old Dominion." I had been seated but a few moments when the attorney wound up i with the following:                  .: "Yes, gentlemen, the whole system of religion is one  t grand humbug, and its votaries are either mono-maniacs, or 1j poor illiterate, deluded beings. It is the poor and unlearned : i alone, who are the most numerous of its disciples. Why iH is it, I ask, that the poor man is more susceptible than the Xi rich man to religious influence? One hundred poor men   become converts to the theory to ten wealthy; would you  S have proof? look around you. Why is it, I ask? What   X say you stranger, in answer to this interrogatory?" said the attorney, turning abruptly to an elderly, rather distinguished looking gentleman, who sat quietly smoking his pipe in a far corner of the room, and who had arrived at thp inn but an hour or two before me. "What is the reason, you ask? Why, it is simply because the wealthy are too much occupied with the business, the cares and the pleasures of life to give a thought to religion. They won't take time to give the subject a serious thought. One said 'he had a yoke of oxen, and that he wished to prove them, therefore, he prayed to be excused; another a piece of land,' &c. The minds of the poor are not thus absorbed with the trash of earth to the exclusion of that which is priceless. True, God has chosen the weak and foolish to confound the strong and wise in many instances    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    219 yet, believe me, it is not the illiterate alone who are so blessed of God as to be recipients of His grace and mercies. The wisest men the world has ever seen have acknowledged His supremacy and bowed with a willing knee. Where is an unbeliever now in this enlightened country, where the majesty, the goodness and glory of God have been manifest- ed so often, and so clearly demonstrated, but that is a weak, vain, upstart.? The world, from superstition, ah, and chaos, has been changed by this same religion, which you, anon, reviled to be almost a paradise. The dark places of the earth have been lighted up, the dominion of the devil has !   been subverted, and civilization, by its instrumentality, now blooms where ferocity once reigned, and the sound of the gospel is now heard among men where scenes were once enacted too dark and revolting for gentle ears; and nations which were once mantled with superstition, and whose streams were ever tinged with human gore, and stained, even with the blood of martyrs and of innocence, now waft in  I peace the glorious banner of the cross. Beware, young man how you sneer at that which, to secure for us, a Saviour offered up his life as a willing sacrifice. Did I not know, young man, that it was through ignorance on your part that you thus revile, I would exclaim to you, in the language of Paul: "C O, full of all subtlety, and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?" "Ha! ha! ha!" interrupted the lawyer; " bad I known that I had waked up an old Methodist preacher, I would have taken 'time by the forelock,' and run at once." "! am  not a Methodist preacher, sir; I haven't that honor-they are a pious, a useful, a revered class of people whom I love and respect."      t '"Who are you, then?" demanded insolently the attorney. "Sam Houston, sir, of Texas." y     220    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTM,  Had a thunderbolt fallen in their midst, there would not E have been a more electric motion in the crowd. In a second ! the old hero was surrounded, and twenty welcome hands    ? were extended. I made my exit just then to the dining- room, and as I looked back over my shoulder, I saw the little crest-fallen attorney sneaking out of the opposite door."                           X "But, fie! boy, we are letting our breakfast get cold.- ? Steam away, and 'loose its fragrance on the desert air, i' cried the Major, as he took his seat at the groaning board. "Aye, boy, but eating is a great invention. I do love to .5 eat. Mince-pie, sausages, beef-steak and onions, such as we have before us, would drown the sorrow of the most forlorn. I, for my part, attach more importance to the   - i savory, yet learned profession of cookery, than to the legal - profession. The one creates more happiness, more enjoy-  ment, by far, than the other. Old Acum," continued the Major, smacking his lips, " was a man of sense. He says:  j "'Cookery, or the art of preparing good and wholesome food, and of preserving all sorts of alimentary substances if in a state fit for human sustenance, of rendering that agree- able to the taste which is essential to the support of life, i; and of pleasing the palate without injury to the system, is, 'is strictly speaking, a branch of chemistry*; but, important as it is both to our enjoyments and our health, it is also one of the least cultivated branches of that science. The culinary process of roasting, boiling, baking, stewing, frying, broil- ing, the art of preserving meats, bacon, and hams; the preparations of sauces, pickles, and other condiments; the conserving of fruits; the care and keeping of vegetables; the making of jellies, jams, and marmalades, are all founded upon the principles of this science, and much waste of the material, as well as labor to the parties might often be spared, were those to whom the performance of such tasks   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     221 is committed, made acquainted with simple chemical truths which would invariably lead to certain results. And, be- sides, the same knowledge would enable them to attain at much greater degree of perfection in curing and preserving I. all kinds of animal and vegetable aliments, aud in combin-  I ing the three grand requisites of taste, nutriment, and     salubrity, in whatever manner they may be prepared.--     i And, though this art is at present in rude hands, as all branches of chemistry were originally, there is no reason that it should remain so. A kitchen is, in fact, a chemical laboratory; the boilers, stew-pans, and cradle spit of the cook, correspond to the digesters, the evaporating basins,  : and the crucibles of the chemist. And numerous as the a  receipts of cookery are, the general operations dike the I general process of chemistry) are but few. In some the object aimed at is, to extract the constituent parts of the food, so as to exhibit them in a separate state, or to combine them with other substances, to produce new compounds which differ widely from those from which they originated. In others, the qualities of the substances are simply altered by the action of fire, to render them more palatable and nutritious. From the multiplicity of circumstances to be attended to in this art, the whole of which is founded upon the principles of chemistry, we may easily see that it must be a very pre- carious one; and, there is reason to believe, that among the  variety of circumstances which produce diseases, the im- proper modes of cooking food, are often the primary cause. Verily, where such detestable systems of cookery are prac- tised, we may exclaim with the sacred historian, that there is 'Death in the Pot.' Food badly cooked is wasted to no purpose. It seems to have been a complaint familiar in the mouth of our ancestors and which we may have too often seen reason to re-echo in 19*     222    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. the present day--"That God sends good meat, but the devil sends cooks." "However extravagant and whimsical the rational pleas- i ures of the'table may appear to a sober and sensible mind, we must, in justice to epicures, cursorily observe, that there exists a material difference between a gormand, or epicure, and a glutton. The first seeks for peculiar delicacy and distinct flavour in the various dishes presented to the judg- ment and enjoyment of his discerning palate; while the :i. other lays aside nearly all that relates to the rational pleas- : ures of creating or stimulating an appetite of the tates, and looks merely to a quantity; this, has his stomach in view, and tries how heavy it may be ladened, without endangering !

X "The glutton is anathematised in the Scripture with those brutes quorum deus venter est. The other appears guilty of no other sin than of too great, and too minute, an at- : tention to refinement in commercial sensuality." Our neighbors on the other side of the channel, so famous for indulging in the worship of Comus, consider the epicure  again under two distinct views, namely: as a gormand, or I a gourmet. The epicure or gornzand is defined--a man having accidentally been able to study the different tastes of eatables, does accordingly select the best food and the most pleasing to his palate. His character is that of a practitioner. The gourmet speculates more than he practises, and eminently prides himself in discerning the nicest de- grees, and most evanescent shades of goodness and perfec- tion in the different subjects proposed to him. He may be designated a man, who, by sipping a few drops out of the    AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.       223 silver cup of the vintner, can instantly tell from what coun- try the wine comes, and its age. The glutton practices without any regard to theory. The gormand, or epicure, unites theory with practice. The gourzment is merely theoretical." "Now my son, I have concluded my prosey homily, as well also my breakfast, so I will even return thanks for the blessings of which we have so heartily partaken, in the language of my old friend, parson Sullens. The parson had been regaled by his friend, Dr. Murray, day after day, ) with the delicacy of rabbits, till he became so sick of them, that he hinted his dislike of the standing dish to the host, in the following grace, on arising from the table:" '* Of rabbits hot, of rabbits cold, Of rabbits tender, rabbits tough, Of rabbits young, of rabbits old, I thank the Lord, we've had enough." "After resting a few days in the cities of Hamburg and Augusta, (just across the Savannah river) we parted, the Major and I. Sad was the parting. He gave me many letters of introduction to his -friends in Charleston, much good advice, along with the present of a check on his Charleston banker, for a thousand dollars, saying, with his voice now tremulous with emotion, " take it boy, take it! I am rich, have no relatives, no heirs, unless I adopt you, which is not unlikely. When you get tired of the city, join me in the interior, and so soon as this hated election- eering tour is over, we'll e'en travel again.' And thus we parted for a time, the one at least, with tearful eyes, with a sick and heavy heart. Of my further adventures in the Carolinas, and my return home, I will entertain this audi- ence, at some future day. Already have I occupied your attention too long. It would take me a fortnight longer to     224   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. recount my adventures, and would fill a book of some three : hundred pages, so, as I anticipate publishing my travels  and adventures, shortly, I will, for the present, give way, i for others present, who are far more able to interest you ^ than myself.

THE Eritish Commissioner of Cuban affairs, Sir Alexan- der Boteler, was called upon, by Mr. Breckenridge, for ,a reminiscence, and replied as follows: 'i "You all know, gentlemen, that I was once an American citizen, and that too, but a few years agone. Why have I, then, forsaken my country, and taken upon myself titles inimical and at variance with my republican principles? It was not that I loved our glorious institutions less! No, no! every triumph of American arms or diplomacy still bring joy to my heart. I glory in our noble destiny-you smile, Judge Douglas, that I use the word ' our.' I must be allowed this privilege. Though I am sworn to protect British interests, aud to uphold and defend her cause, yet, believe me, my heart is with you--as well could I speak harsh words of my old parents; suffer me then the great luxury.     "I have been asked the fortieth time, since my arrival here, how I won my title. I will tell you. I am a native of the western part of Tennessee. In the winter of 18- I had occasion to visit the eastern part of the State on business for my father. This portion is commonly called the '"Switzerland of America," and is very mountainous, as the Hon. Mr. Taylor can testify, who now represents it in the Congress of the United States. Indeed, one of the - ' r        ;F      226    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. highest peaks east of the Rocky Mountain, divides the State of North Carolina, or at least we are so informed by the I Hon. T. L. Clingman, who is even now holding controversy  with Prof. Mitchel upon the subject.         H It was one evening in December that I picked my solitary way close around the base of Buffalo mountain. It had : been snowing the whole night previous, and the ground was covered to the depth of several feet. The road was a well beaten one, and led from Jonesborough, a small town in ; Washington County, to a place known as 'Blair's Iron  i Works.' As the day advanced, the weather became more mild, and,' to my great fear, I could, at intervals, hear a  wild cracking sound in the mountains, the sure precursor : of a storm. I would have fled, but no way could I better Ax myself than to push steadily on. It was as far back as it ,was forward to a place of security, and at my 'side dashed i the angry Nola Chucky, swollen to a fearful extent; so, with an excited mind, I pushed forward. The noise increas-! ed till it changed from the low, ominous sound-into an angry growl. As it was, I was startled by a noise overhead louder ; than the shriek of a thousand storm spirits; the powerful horse I strode squatted in very fright in the road. I looked up; the whole mountain appeared to be coming upon me. As I sat, for a moment, in despair, awed and unnerved, a sheet of snow, of many acres in extent, shot over me from the lofty height above, into the river below. I was protect- ed by a huge cleft of rocks, and was untouched. When the noise had somewhat subsided, I heard the neighing, or rather screaming, of a horse but a few feet in advance; I spurred round the angle, and saw the top of a carriage protruding but a few inches above the snow, and two horses floundering in-or rather the upheaving commo- tion of the snow gave evidence they were there, for they were almost invisible, and at times, completely covered.

I dis- mounted, and soon made a road to the carriage, the door of Il which I finally pulled open, with great difficulty. It was  ; tenanted by a venerable-looking old gentleman and a young   X lady.  I assisted them out, and conveyed them to the shelter   i- under the cliff, and then went in search of the driver, whom I finally found, but so much injured that I had to pick him up in my arms and carry, or rather drag, him through the   :]-; snow. The horses, too, I got out, and led to a shelter    l under the cliff. I had now time to look at the travelers, who, I after-    S wards found, were Europeans on a tour through the United   - States. The man was a fair specimen of a " fine old Eng-   $; glish gentleman." The lady--but I haven't language to describe her, nor shall I attempt it. Suffice it to say-  "Grace shaped her limbs, and beauty deck'd her face." What eyes! what lips! what a gentleness, yet majesty of    IS mien!-but wheugh! it was too cold to stand and feast     I longer; so thought the father. I, on the contrary, would have willingly died there.           -         "What shall we do now, good friends and passengers?"     interposed Cthe gentlema n l interposed the gentleman.

Rescue her! Believe me, gentlemen, I would have gone through fire for them. I clambered up the cliff and looked around, for the storm   ; had somewhat subsided, and night was coming down with a' swoop.  Backward from the road were nothing but lofty    ,:  tA *      =21   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.  mountains, covered with snow; the road on either hand was blocked up, and our only chance, then, lay in the di-. rection of the river.  Advancing higher up the rugged cliff, I beheld, about a  mile away, across the river, a dozen streams of curling  smoke ascending in the air. My only chance lay in ford-  ing the river to procure assistance. I descended, and re- ported accordingly; but they would not listen to my at- tempting to cross, lest I should get drowned in the swollen stream.                       -:! It was, without doubt, a dangerous undertaking; but it was the only chance; and as I had a good horse, and was, withal, a good swimmer, I resolved to try it, at all events. So, stating my intention to the lady and gentle-  man, whose prayers I scarcely heard, and summoning all  my strength and resolution, I set out with the determination of accomplishing the feat and rescuing my companions, or finding a grave beneath the foaming waters of the Chucky. But how should I reach the river? was the first question! Let it suffice that, by dint of half-an-hour's hard labor, I managed to get down through the snow to the bank. The river roared awfully, but, nevertheless, I mounted my good steed, and we plunged in. The noble animal floundered a little at first, but, recovering, he struck out boldly for the opposite shore. The yellow waters seethed and foamed and hissed around us, and although we were carried some dis- tance down the river, yet we gained the bank with less ex- ertion than I had anticipated. As I went up on the shore I wheeled, and was gladdened and cheered by the waving of a lady's scarf on the oppo- site side. After a ride of a few moments I arrived at Biair's Mills, where I quickly raised a sufficient company, with boats, to land the travelers, horses, carriage, and all. I did not   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     229     ! return with them, as I was so overcome with cold and fatigue that I was fain to rest my weary limbs by a blazing fire. But, before retiring to rest, I was gladdened with the intelligence that the party had arrived in safety, and were  at lodgings where they would be well cared for, and every attention paid them. As my business in the country was urgent, I arose and started by the peep of day. I never learned the names of I the party until I went to England, nor did they learn mine, for I was a stranger in that part of the country. I learned, as I returned back through the mountains, that they waited a week to gain tidings of me-no doubt to pay me for my services, had I been miserable enough to 'have. accepted any; or, per-chance, to thank me for my timely assistance. Well, two years passed away, and found me en route for England, as private secretary to Mr. Mason. M1r. Mason was plenipotentiary and envoy extraordin- ary, and, from the position he occupied, was at once thrown into the best society in the country. I often accompanied him to the parties, balls, receptions, etc., which were held almost every evening at the mansions of the great. I was electrified, on one occasion,. after I had been in England six months, by a sight of my fair inamorata-the lady I rescued in the mountains of East Tennessee. The fair lady appeared to be in exstacies as well as my- self, and received me most kindly and courteously. My old passion was kindled into a flame again. I sought her spci- ety daily-wooed her-won her-married her.

"Tenniessee and Kentucky have produced many excen- tric, quaint, and original characters. The mountain-bound and insolated position of the country, is peculiarly adapted to the production of or'inal natural characters. Here they are free from the corruption of the cities and the examples of the world. The citizens, more particularly of South. eastern Kentucky, and East Tennessee, are emphatically true To nature, simple in their habits, and honest in their intercourse, one with another. 4' These observations will apply particularly, to a former period-to the period when Jackson, Houston, Crockett, Bean, and Sevier, figured it Tennessee, and Boon, in Ken- tucky. The Carolinians ever looked upon them as wonder- ful beings-half-horse, and half-aligator, with a considerable touch of the bear and the buffoon ; and their primitive and eccentric habits, sayings, and doings, were ever a source of merriment and ridicule, to the more worldly and less inso- lated Carolinians.   -  It was at that period when the noted characters above mentioned, figured in Tennessee and Kentucky, that a horse-drover, from the former State, might have been seen driving into Columbia, South Carolina, with a large drove   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTSS.   231 of stock. He was a tall, fine-looking man, of some twenty- M eight or thirty summers. Although plainly clad, yet every movement betokened grace and polish of manners. He was well and favorably known in Tennessee, as Col. Adam Broyles. "Tennessee and Kentucky horse-drovers, were not as numerous then, as now; indeed but few drovers had ever I entered Columbia before. So, many an admiring and ten- t der glance from balcony and window, colonade and recess, and inquisitive, mirthful, and withal, envious look from the shops and passers-by, were cast upon the fresh, portly- looking Tennessean, as he drove into town, and took lodg- ings at the Congaree House. The town was quite thronged, for both the Superior and Federal Courts were in session, as also the Legislature.                    i On the evening of the arrival of our hero, a grand ball was to come off at Mrs. A-'s, in the upper part of the city, and so, in the course of the evening, he was waited upon by a deputation of gentlemen, and invited to attend. The Colonel thanked them for the courtesy, and declined going, as he was but roughly clad, not designing to enter into company at all, when he left home-hence his dilemma. "That makes no difference, sir, whatever," plead they- "we insist upon you going. In fact, we are commissioned by the ladies, enmasse, to bring you." "I am sorry to disappoint them, gentlemen, but I must decline;" and the Colonel bowed them out most blandly. "You done ezactly right, Colonel," said one of his men, ' I know these Carolinians-they think every Tennessean a nateral-born green-horn, and they want to make sport of you, as they have made of me, many a time, dod rot 'em." "Do they, eh? Had I known that, I should have gone, for the fun of the thing, to see the sport, at least."-- Scarce had thirty minutes elapsed, when our hero was sum- ... I     232    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. moned down to the parlor by a bevy of ladies. The Col. i entered, bowing, and was again solicited to attend the party. The invitation was at once accepted, but the Colonel stip- ulated with the ladies, that he should be permitted to wear his buck-skin breeches'; to which they blushingly assented. At the appointed hour, the Colonel, after fortifying himself C with a glass of old cognac, entered the brilliant saloon, preceded by the master of ceremonies.  Although he entered and conducted himself in the most awkward and e ridiculous manner he could assume, yet he was immediately surrounded by a score of ladies who seemed to be highly  amused at, and interested in our hero 'hoosier.'  Supper was soon announced, and our hero, escorted by a  number of ladies, seated himself at the table; the ladies  seating themselves around him, watching his every move-  ment with the greatest curiosity. And well they might, for no mortal ever ate such a supper before. Cake after cake, and dainty after dainty disappeared as if by magic, until the accommodating young ladies, backed by a servant or two, grew weary of waiting upon, and laughing at him. After he had somewhat satisfied himself, one of the ladies, by the way, the belle of the town, (the description of whom I gave at the commencement of this true reminiscence,) turned, and with a lisping voice asked him, after a whispered giggled coloquy with her companions, what kind of Tea he preferred? cc We all have our preferences, sir, and would be pleased to hear your judgment," 'thinking no doubt, he would say Sage, Pennyroyal, or the essence of some other of his native yarbs. "I have a preference, ladies, to-be- sure, but,"- -'Aye, what kind, then do you prefer?" "I prefer beautea, modestea, and civilitea," replied he, looking up and down the table, ' but I am sorry to say, I see neither here."   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     233 "Don't you, indeed," replied she, evidently a little   i piqued. "If you have so much beautea in your country, it's a wonder such a discrimninator, such a polished gentle- man as yourself hasn't taken a wife before now."       I "Why, Miss, to tell the truth, I have taken wives before I! now, but then, their husbands never seemed to like it, so I  gave it up."                          Had a gun gone off amongst a flock of partridges they would not have scattered with more agility than did the fun- making, inquisitive young ladies, reminding our hero, as he made his escape from the room, most forcibly of those lines of Southey- - "We sat down and wept by the waters Of Camus, and thought of the day        - When damsels would show their red garters, In their hurry to scamperaway." The Hon. John Bell, of Tennessee, was next solicited for a story, and responded with' "THE FEARFUL RETROSPECT; OR, THE VOW THAT Was KEPT. "Many years ago, there dwelt in Newhern, North Caro- lina, a young man by the name of William Patterson. He was of good family, fine appearance, and good address; but he had one failing, which too many of our youths now- a-days have, of tampering -with the wine-cup. Like thou- sands of others, he thought it was no harm to take an occasional sip, till he became a little hardened in the prac- tice, and finally, he thought it no great harm to take a spree now and then, till he became a confirmed drunkard. In vain did his friends remonstrate, in vain did his uncle, upon whose bounty he was dependent, threaten to cast him off. All was of no avail. He acknowledged his course was contemptible; that he was doing wrong-ruining him- 20* \     234    AMERICAN NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENTS. self, soul, body, and character. Still he persisted in his course, for he was one of the thousands in our country who use alcohol and tobacco to excess, and believe and assert thllt they cannot, from their long habit and practice, refrain from it, and consequently never make the effort. Finally, his course of debauchery became so open and reckless that his uncle, who had given up all hopes of re- claiming him, gave him a few hundred dollars, in a fit of anger, and cast him off, bidding him never appear in his presence again. Covered with shame and stung with remorse, (for the young man was not without the finest feelings and the most tender sensibilities,) he rushed madly from his uncle's resi- dence, towards the wharf, resolving, on his way, to never drink again. But ere he reached the levee he was beset by one of his boon companions;--a "real out-and-outer,"- who soon, by dint of persuasion, drove from his mind all his good resolves, led him into a grocery, and in a very few hours he was again      q "In a weaving, weaving way." Before they separated, his companion, who was a mate in the brig Belle Johnson, enticed him to embark with him for }New York. Accordingly, next morning he set sail from his home and kindred, to wander, he knew not where. He took a good supply of liquors with him, which, with his valice, was his only baggage. They set sail with a calm seca and a fair breeze, which continued so till the day previous to their arrival in New York, when the sky began to lower, the clouds to darken, and the winds to blow at a fearful rate. The sea became exceedingly boisterous, and in an hour's time the decks were completely washed by the spray and fragments of the mountain waves that dashed over them.   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    235    - In the meanwhile, the lightnings were playing around, and the thunders bursting overhead, with a noise the most deafening and terrific. Though the-crew remained calm, yet the passengers were in deep distress. The storm waxed I greater and greater, and, as it did so, all became confusion   on'deck. Just at this moment of peril, when the storm was at its height, a huge wave rolled over the deck, sweeping, as it went, one of the passengers, a young lady, into the boister- ous deep. All now became uproar; but loud above the shrieks of women and children, the hoarse voices of men, and the roar of the tempest, the shrill voice of the captain was heard crying, "'Bout ship! lower away the boats!- Quick, boys, quick!' At this time our hero, who had been standing for some time on the side of the deck, and, as usual, under a " mid- dling" state of intoxication, perceiving the unfortunate female rise on a huge wave, with a bravery and generosity peculiar only to one in this state, sprang recklessly out, at the imminent peril and almost certain destruction of his own life, and to the mingled admiration and horror of all. For many moments he was lost to view. The boats were lower- ed, and all, both crew and passengers, forgetting their own danger, looked anxiously out on the heaving waters. At the moment when all hope was given up, and some, even, had turned from the pursuit in despair, he was thrown up by a huge wave near the boats, and, to the astonishment of all, held the young lady clasped in his arms. In a mo- ment he reached her up to one of the men in the boat, and, as he relaxed his hold, sank back, overcome with exhaus- tion, into the waves, before he could be secured. The sea rolled over him, and it was many minutes ere he was found and brought on deck.  He remained long in a state of in- sensibility; but by dint of skilful treatment, he was finally     236    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. restored. When he opened his eyes, and the first signs of life appeared, an irrepressible shout of joy and admiration broke from the throng, showing, most happily, the won- drousness of the huinan heart and the variableness of man's nature, which at one moment is warped with pas- sion, at another elated with joy; at one moment bleeding with sorrow or shrunk aghast with fear, at another display- ing bravery even to recklessness, or giving way to unbounded risibility. The rain now began to pour down in torrents, but at the same time the winds ceased, and the ocean settled down into a calm. Finally, the sun broke forth,[drove the angry clouds from his path, and in a short time made all as serene and sunshiny as himself. Next morning the Belle Johnson rode proudly into the harbor at New York.                i The excitement and fatigue of the evening previous had thrown our hero into a high state of fever, and he was con- veyed to the residence of Dr. Samuel Carson, the parent of the young lady so providentially rescued, where every comfort and kindness was shown him that gratitude and wealth could bring, till his recovery, which was several weeks. When he at last returned to consciousness, and was able to speak, he told his uncle, who, having repented send- ing him off, had followed, to endeavor to reclaim and take him back to his home again, that, he was a new man ; that he had been taken into judgment, where the secrets of all hearts are made known; " and there," said he, "I read the reckoning of my past life. When having delivered dear Julia, here, who has kindly watched at my bedside like a guardian angel, as she is, and to whom I am indebted for my recovery,--when having delivered her to the sea- man, I sank back exhausted, like one lying down to rest; consciousness forsook me, and a pleasing sensation per-   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    237 -  vaded my system. Again consciousness returned, andoh!! with what fear and anguish! I felt that I was drowning, and in a moment's time, which to me seemed ages, my mind M reviewed the past, which had been spent for naught, and in vain: talents unimproved, years misspent, sins perpetrated without end; and all-all, since I became a disciple of Bacchus. Oh, God! but it was a fearful retrospect." The young man shook convulsively, trembled, and covered his face with his hands. "But the retrospect was not all.-- Methought I heard an angry voice exclaim, 'Woe! woe! unto you, you sinner, you dram-drinker! You were made pure, but you have become unclean: talents were given unto you, but you have buried them : desire and appetite were given unto you, and privileges and graces, but you abused them all-all From a being created in the image of God, you have fallen-become a brute--a being loath- some ; and all for sensual enjoyments. Beware! beware! "the way of the transgressor is hard."' fWhen the voice ceased I vowed to God, if he spared me, that I would never taste spirits again: nor will I. If I do, may my tongue, on the instant, be parched, my eyes dimmed, and my hand palsied in death." Nor did he ever drink again. Forty years have passed since then, and though time hath changed all things, though his eyes have lost their wonted fire, his flowing locks have become white as snow, and his frame feeble, yet he ever kept his vow. He never drank again. 5     238    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. SEVENTEElNT         H I NIGHT . TH:E COBBLER OF MEXICO. An Incident in the Life of Santa Anna. MR. BENJAMN, having been solicited, entertained the company with the following story: I was seated on the piazza in front of my boarding- house, in this city, a short time ago, discussing, in company with my friends, Messrs. Hamilton, of Texas, and Vance, of North Carolina, the merits of a dozen delicious Havanas, when an open coach-and-four, containing a tall, heavy-built, swarthy-looking man, came whirling past. "That gentleman is a cobbler," quietly remarked Vance, as, emitting a huge volume of smoke, he blew it in curling eddies high up in the air. "What! that gentleman in the coach? You wish to make yourself witty, sir. That's Don Senor La Vega, the Mexican Minister," replied I. ' Even so, even so, mine ancient friend: still he is a cobbler, and I'll warrant me, can make as good a pair of shoes as e'er a Yankee in the District. The transforma- tion is marvellous, yet true. How short-sighted is man! Who can see a day, an hour, a moment, in the future? Who can tell his destiny--what he will come to? People call me an old, confirmed bachelor, as well as yourself, but who knows that I may not yet become a benedict, a senator, or president? Who knows?"   AMERICAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS.      239   i "Not I, indeed! but the latter is more feasible-more  - likely."       : "And why so, pray?" "I'll tell you anon ;--but the story of the cobbler."  "Aye, well!--The Mexicans, you know, are a kind of wishy-washy people, having no stability about them. Igno- ! rance, weakness, indecision, are all indelibly stamped upon their treacherous countenances. To-day they worship one man; to-morrow he is despised, hurled from his position, and his enemy installed in lieu thereof. But you, gentle- men, and all the world, know the Mexican character as well as I do.-But to the point. "In the year '36, the people were wroth, even to mad- ness, with Santa Anna, for some fancied wrong. The city of Mexico was in an uproar. All was confusion. The old warrior, a month before, was a perfect god; but now, his name was a by-word-was treason. "He was dragged'by the infuriated mob from his palace, the proud halls once graced by the Montezumas, out upon the public plaza, and through the streets, towards the don- jons of the castle Alecco, where they intended to incarce- rate him. The streets of the city were alive with people. : Men, women, and children filled every street, balcony, and house-top. It was a motly mass of Mexicans, Spaniards,  ! Creoles, and Indians. "The proud president of millions of people was rudely tumbled into a cart, and dragged, amid the jeers, the mis- siles, and the curses of the infuriated people, through the streets. "They at last reached the frowning walls of the castle, within whose donjons he was to be entombed. By this time the excitement of the infuriated mob was intense, venting itself in one general roar, like an angry sea. "Just as the vast gates swung open, and the celadores     240   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. dashed wildly about, endeavoring to force a way for the cart, a single horseman, seated upon a powerful black horse, was seen dashing recklessly through the masses of human beings around. He was a dark, swarthy man, of powerful mould, and wielded a huge bar of iron in his hand, with which he parted the crowd right and left, and urged on his powerful steed, crying I death to the tyrant!' with a loud voice, that sounded high above the shrieks, the curses, the tramp, and the roar of the multitude. "4 On, on he came, while the mass parted on either side, for fear of being trampled by the horse or hurled down by the bar, as it whizzed around the head of the dark rider. "'Death to the tyrant! to the gallows-tree with him! avast, there!' yelled the rider to the crowd, as he spurred over them, and gained the cart. Quick as thought he caught up the luckless president, drew him, as he would a child, before him, wheeled, and before the crowd could think, was dashing down the plaza de la Cobada. "'A rescue! a rescue!' was now heard on a thousand tongues. All was consternation and confusion. Missiles flew around them as 'thick as hail, shots were fired, and anon, the boom of canon was heard from the fortress, doing great havoc among the masses, but without injuring the fugitives. "On, on, they went, with the speed of the wind, taking the road to San Jose 'y La Virgen. The city was soon far behind them in the distance, and the booming was no longer heard; the spires, the domes, and the turrets were no longer seen: they made good their escape. "The mysterious horseman was La Vega, and La Vega was a cobbler. 1' He was indebted to Santa Anna for some favor he had once done him; hence his gratitude, in the successful effort to rescue the fallen hero. ^    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    -241 "Santa Anna was shortly afterwards recalled, reinstated in power, and again worshipped by the people. His first act was one of gratitude. He raised the cobbler from his stall, enriched him, and made him powerful. He -is here now, as you know, as the Mexican Minister, appointed under the administration of General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna." James Buchanan entertained the company next, "with YOUNG AMERICA; OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A JOURNEYMAN TAILOR. "I say, General, General Jackson, for fear that you should think my motives of an interested and personal na- ture, in attempting to detain you at my house all night, I will agree to entertain you free of expense," expostulated the landlord of the only inn in the village of Jefferson, Ashe county, North Carolina, to General Jackson, one evening in the autumn of 18-, as he entered his carriage to pursue his journey towards Tennessee. "The Blue Ridge, sir, is infested with banditti, and you will certainly be robbed, and possibly murdered, before morning. I beseech you, stay." ' Mine host is very kind, and I thank him," replied the General, " but I shall proceed, and reach the Tennessee line, at all events. I fear not robbers. Drive on, Ned, briskly; adieu! gentlemen, all!" and the old hero drove off at a rapid pace. "I say, I say, youngster," cried the boots," if you are going to Tennessee, you had better jump up behind, and go Llong with the General; it's as cheap riding as walking." So I will, so I will, and thank you for the hint," replied 21     242   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. the young man, jumping up behind the coach as it drove off. "Who's that behind?" interrogated the General, of the driver. "It's me, sir, Andrew Johnson. I am a traveller, sir, on my way to Tennessee, and I thought I would avail my- self of this way of expediting my progress." "You are quite welcome, sir. Come forward and take a seat in the carriage." "General Jackson is very kind, but I will keep my seat," replied the youngster. "The mountain-side is rather steep here, so I will jump off presently and walk up." He walked forward up the mountain-side, and as he did so, he saw a man in advance, ascending the mountain. He appeared to be intoxicated. He lurched this way and the other way, staggering backwards and forwards: now his knees would double up, he would step high, as if the earth had suddenly vanished before him; anon he would cross his legs, and then a lurch would send him diagonally across the road: now he would stop and brace himself up so as to nearly fall backwards, and then drift helplessly along. Presently he turned an angle in the road, and was out of sight. "That man is beastly drunk," remarked the General. "Drunk! ha! ha [ ha!" laughed the young man: "he is no more intoxicated than you or I. He's acting 'possum. Depend upon it, he has some wicked scheme in view; he intends us mischief:--but see, yonder he lies in the road." As they drove up he raised himself lazily and hailed them. "Hie! ah, H say, gentlemen, can't you give a man a lift?  H-I-hie! can't walk; I'm  loaded too heavily with d---d mean whisky." "If you are, stay there, and disgorge it ruffian," replied the General.   IAMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    243    ? "The devil! exclaimed the man, springing to his feet with the agility of a cat. He gave a keen whistle, and planted himself in front of the coach. Three men sprang  - out from the bushes by the side of the road and made a rush at the carriage. Quick as thought the General sprang upon one of them, and they rolled over in the road together. A dull, crushing sound next was heard over the conflict, and a second one rolled over in the dust, propelled by the loaded whip, in the powerful hands of the driver. The young man, by a timely shot, fired upon and brought down a third, and then sprang to the assistance of the General, who still fought manfully with his antagonist, while the driver engaged the remaining one. "Stand back! stand back!" cried the General to the young man: " we are man to man: I'll give the villain fair play. By the Eternal! I have you now!" and the Gene- ral threw his antagonist over, apparently lifeless. "Are you hurt, my valliant young friend?" inquired the General :-"' and you, too, Ned? Where's Ned?" "Here, massa," replied the boy, puffing up the mountain side. IMyrobber coward; he run, he! he! he! I golly, I save one, massa save one, and de gemmen save one;- he! he! he!" All this occurred in less time than it takes to recount it. "But you, General, are you hurt?" "No serious wound; nothing but a few bruises, thank God!-But look yonder; one of the scamps has come to life. You, sir, and Ned, pinion his hands, while I examine the others." None of them were found to be dead. Two were only stunned, and the third received a pistol-shot through the fleshy part of the leg, and had crouched down in affright. They were all soon pinioned, and a council was held, when so     244   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. it was determined to disarm them, and let them go, rather than be detained upon the road. No further incidents befel our travellers during their jaunt. On their separation in Tennessee, the General gave the young man much good advice. He recounted to him his own history, and bade him aspire to be useful, to be good, to be noble. The General continued ens route for his home in the west- ern part of the State, and the young man halted and settled in the town of Greeneville, Tennessee, as a journeyman tailor. "That young man, gentlemen," continued Mr. Buchan- an, " is here present in our midst, a living type of this pro. gressive age--of Young America. He rapidly rose from the bench--the tailor's, I mean--to a seat in the Legisla- ture of Tennessee. There he continued for several years, with honor to himself and profit to his country. He has been in the Congress of the United States fourteen conse- cutive years, is now a member of the Senate of the United States, has been Governor of his State twice, and no doubt will one day be our Chief Magistrate. I am prouid, gen- tlemen, in having the honor of presenting to you the Hon. Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee." When Mr. Buchanan had concluded his story, a song was sung, complimentary to the ladies, by the celebrated Parson Brownlow, of Tennessee. lie remarked that "variety was the spice of life," and as singing was "a a part and parcel" of his vocation, as well as Speaking, he would entertain the company with a song. "Woman's the theme. This train of thought," remarked he, was brought to his mind by recognizing in the company a noble lady who once saved his life. "Many years ago a poor, wan, emaciated young man 9    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    245 lay stretched in a little, hot, foetid berth on the boat A-- - as she hove to at -  , to discharge her passengers and freight, and to take in wood. The cholera was raging among crew and passengers to an alarming extent. No less than twenty had died on the way It was a wretched night when the boat landed. The rain poured down in torrents; yet it did not deter the pas- sengers from landing. All that were able rushed ashore, and most of those that were not were placed in a shed on the wharf, by the cap- tain, whence they were taken to the hospital, and other places, by the physicians of the place. One by one, they took them off, till they were all gone, save the young man in question, who lay stretched on the hard floor, unable to move; and him they left to suffer and die, because he was poor and penniless, and not able to pay for his conveyance to the hospital, and his maintenance whilst there. True, several of the physicians, as they passed the young man, gazed upon him for a moment with compassion, but turned away, muttering, ' there are many others abler; let them see to him ;' and he was left alone in that dreary place, to suffer and die. The merciless storm increased, and roared, and howled, and dashed through the desolate place, drenching him at every blast. At times his groans mingled with the howling elements, and sounded far out in the distance. Fervently, devoutly he prayed for succor; but in vain. His cries and groans were unheard and unheeded. Many times he thought of reconciling his mind to the idea of death: but oh, to die thus! far, far away from home and friends, in this wretched condition. Oh! but it was horrible! and, forgetting his agony in his sympathy, he cried aloud like a child, for the first time in many years. But a light flared into the boat, just as hope had expired, 21*     246    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. and he had given himself up to die.  A voice, too, was heard, exclaiming, 'I can't rest till I see for myself. My husband, I know, said they were all conveyed off, and he has as many as he can attend; but I could not rest without searching myself--something propells me forward. Hark! I'm sure I heard a groan. Let's hasten on; those ras- cally, parsimonious physicians have left some one, sure  enough." "What's that to us, ma'am, if they have? D'ye think I'd risk my life hauling a king, even, aflicted with that terrible disease, let alone some thankless pauper," replied the gruff voice of a servant, that accompanied the lady-- for it was a lady-who searched him out on that eventful night. "Be a man, Jones! Every man's your brother! But Heavens! yonder lies the poor sufferer. Haste! let's take him home."  And that elegantly dressed lady assisted the servant to convey the poor outcast through the mud and rain to her elegant home. I am the outcast," continued the parson, "and yonder's the angel;" and bowing low to the lady-the Hon. Mrs. Nicholson, of Tennessee-he sang, in a full, strong voice, in his own peculiar style, the following tribute to the lady, and through her, to the whole sex : Sc There is a language of the heart - That mocks all learning's studied art, There is an utterance of the soul That laughs at scholarship's control, Breathes forth in verse a living thought, With feeling, love, and nature fraught; Woman's the theme; and who would eoer require One borrowed string to animate his lyre. There is a witchery that lies Within the sunshine of her eyes,   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.          247     s More potent than the magic spell Of talisman, or fairy dell. Who has not felt her very name Inspire his heart and thrill his frame? Idolatry! the frowning world may cry; But who has loved, norfelt the ecstacy. O who has ever in that hour,  ' When woman's love and woman's power Have twined their influence round his heart, Felt not that woman can impart By smile, or glance, or smothered sigth, A world of bliss and constancy? Priestess of Love! how oft thou'rt left ro mourn Man's perfidy-forsaken and forlorn, There is a vigil in the sky That marks the villain's perjury.- How can he hope to be forgiven Who breaks on earth his vows to Heavetn? He wedded in this world may be, But Hell, like his inconstancy, Will echoing yell the oath that fires his breath, And brand it in the registry of death. Pleasure's a poor and gaudy toy A forgery on solid joy, A gilded chain that drags the slave Helpless and childless to the grave. The haunted Libertine, who lies Without one hand to close his eyes, Sighs to the passing breeze his dying groan, Companionless, unwedded, and alone. Man has a wandering heart-his soul Spurns fetters, slavery, and control: To-day he climbs the snow-clad steep, To-morrow ploughs the foamy deep; And now he roams by mountain-side,           ' Without a friend, without a guide- Till woman bids his wayward steps to cease, And turns h is Arab thoughts to home and peace.     ;440    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.

EIGI[-ITEENTH NIGxHT. THE RESCUE. THE company having again assembled, were entertained by T. B. Graham, with the following: "Many years since, while travelling South, I had occa- sion to tarry a day in the beautiful village of Asheville, North Carolina. By the way, it is a lovely village, situated on an elevated plain that commands a view of the most mag- nificent scenery imaginable. Towering mountains present themselves to, view on the north, east, and west; and on the south, the majestic French Broad. In this delightful retreat scores of wealthy Southrons had sought an asylum  regularly in the sultry months of summer, like the swallow and the lark, for a I period whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary-' some for health, others again for pleasure. At the time of which I speak an unusual number were present, and so crowded were the hotels, that I could scarcely get lodging. Having transacted my business throughout the day, I retired to bed early in the night, for I had many miles to ride next day, and over a country, too, not the smoothest, nor levelest. Wearied with the day's labors I soon resign- ed myself to sleep. My slumbers, however, were not of long duration; for about midnight I was awakened by the fearful cry of 'fire! fire!' coming from a hundred voices,   AMERICAN' NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    251 for the hotel was on fire, and the whole town was aroused. I was soon dressed and on the street, where I found all to be uproar and confusion. The house being of frame, and perfectly dry, caused the flames to spread with great rapid- ity. With such fleetness did they spread from room to room, that no effort whatever was made to stop their progress.-  Already had they shot their forked tongues through the roof, when we were startled by the fearful intelligence that a lodger was missing. "My daughter! My daughter!"Shrieked a gentleman, and springing wildly forward, would have dashed into the thickest of the flames, had he not been prevented by the by-standers. To attempt a passage through the front en- trance, would have been inevitable death, for the - stairs leading from the basement had already fallen in, and the flames crackled, and writhed, and glowed like a furnace. The gentleman, vainly endeavoring to release himself, shouted frantically to the crowd, offering any one a fortune who would save his daughter. "What room is she in?" inquired I, resolved to make the attempt at all events. But without waiting for an answer, I sprang up to the first limb of a tree close by the house, and nimble as a squirrel, clambered up the trembling branches till I came nearly opposite a window of the second story. I was full two yards from it, yet nothing daunted, I made a fearful spring headlong through the window into the room. Springing to my feet I flew with the agility of light, through the dense clouds of smoke and flames which had already spread to the interior of the building. Not finding her in the second story, I reached the third, finally, having been driven back by the heat, more than once. As kind Providence would have it, the first room I entered I found her lying on the floor senseless, and either lifeless or in a swoon, I could not tell, for as I seized her in my arms,     252    AMERICAN NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENTS. I had scarce time to note that she was a very beautiful girl, apparently not over seventeen years. I descended to the window, and the moment I made my appearance, a deafen- ing shout went up from the multitude, that jarred the very house itself. Ere the sounds died away, I had dropped her into the arms of Col. Horace Maynard, who is here present in this assembly. He had just reached the scene of the conflagration. I had scarcely time to see that he had caught her safely in his arms, e'er I sank back in a. swoon, over- come by the heat, smoke, fatigue, and excitement. When I awoke to consciousness, I found myself on a blanket on the green sward, in the rear of the burning mansion, sur- rounded by a crowd of people. Just as I opened my eyes, a fearful, crashing noise rang out on the night, drowning the roar of the flames, the clashing of engines, the neighing of horses, the hum and the tread of the multitude. I sprang to my feet and beheld the vast pile of building tottle and tumble to the ground. Involuntarily I thanked God for my delivery, for had Col. Maynard been a moment later, for it was my friend, here, who sprang up the tree and rescued me from the flames, at the risk of his own life, my destiny on earth would have been sealed forever. I learned from the by-standers, that Miss Julia Dillard, the young lady I rescued, had been in a swoon, and that she had received no other injury, with the exception of scorched clothes and hair. The father and daughter having repaired to a hotel, and not having the inclination, or being in a plight to be seen, 1 right willingly accepted the invitation of Mr. Maynard, and repaired with him to his law office, to tarry the remainder of the night. He was then studying for the legal profes- sion. Having cast aside my soiled clothes, I clad myself in a suit of Maynard's, and sat down with him over a bottle   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.      253 of Maderia, and a dozen exquisite regalias, to talk over the incidents just passed. "Egad! my friend, you are quite a hero," remarked Maynard, Cc your achievements to night are worthy to be    t compared with the deeds of any of the most valiant and doughty knights of the olden time." ' And yours too, are as great, for I owe you, sir, my life." "But, my friend, I owe you more than that; you saved one more precious to me than life--ah  more than ten thousand lives." "How so, Maynard?" "Oh! thereby hangs a tale, which I would relate, were I not fearful of wearying you." "No danger of that, Maynard; on the contrary, it would afford me great pleasure; I insist on hearing it-it will suf- fice to keep us awake till morning." "Well then, here goes." Maynard's Narrative. i' Six years ago, I had occasion to visit the city of Charles- ton, for the first time in my life. I was then scarcely fifteen years of age; proud, warm-hearted, and unsophisticated. It was the time when the yellow fever was raging to a terrible extent throughout all the Southern seaport towns, proving itself a more terrible scourge than the cholero, more fatal than an upas poison. The cases reported in Charleston, however, were confined to certain districts, streets, lanes, wharves, lower, damper, and more marshy and filthy por- tions of the city. Every human means was resorted to, and applied, by the authorities, to stay the epidemic. The infected districts were shut up by fences, but of no avail, it raged with unabated fury. "It was at this period, and on the second day of my arrival in the city, that I strolled through the streets to 22     O 4    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS, view its wonders and curiosities e'er I departed next morn- ing, on my return home. Hour after hour, I wandered up and down the interminable streets, viewing the stately edi- i fices and beautiful grounds. Charleston, I found, contrary to expectation, to be a handsome town; I cannot more fully describe it than to give you Mrs. Butler's language; she says: "This city is the oldest I have yet seen in America--I should think it must be the oldest in it. I cannot say that the first impression produced by the wharf at which we landed, or the streets we drove through in reaching our hotel, was particularly lively. Rickety, dark, dirty, tumble down streets and warehouses, with every now and then a mansion of loftier pretensions, but equally neglected and ruinous in its appearance, would probably not have been objects of special admiration to many people on this side the water; but I belong to that infirm, decrepit, bed-ridden old country, England, and must acknowledge, with a blush for the stupidity of the prejudice, that it is so very long since I have seen any thing old, that the lower staeets of Charleston, in all their dinginess and decay, were a refresh- ment and a rest to my spirit. I have had a perfect red-brick-and-white-board fever ever since I came to this country; and once more to see a house which looks as if it had stood long enough to get warmed through, is a balm to my senses, oppressed with newness. Boston had two or three fine old dwelling-houses, with an- tique gardens and old-fashioned court-yards; but they have come down to the dust before the improving spirit of the age. .And  as for Philadelphia, a house - - owns, and which has actually been built fifty years, is, I believe, the most ancient private tenement in it; and no day passes that I do not hear it reviled for an old brick Methuselah, that should be made to cease cumbering the ground. One   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     255 would think, to hear the people talk, that after ten years a house gets weak in the knees. Perhaps these houses do; but I have lodged under roof-trees that have stood hundreds of years, and may stand hundreds more-marry, they have good foundations. In walking about Charleston, I was forcibly reminded of some of the older country towns in England-of South- ampton a little. The appearance of the city is highly picturesque, a word which can apply to none other of the American towns; and although the place is certainly per- vaded with an air of decay, 'tis a genteel infirmity, as might be that of a distressed elderly gentlewoman. It has none of the snug mercantile primness of the northern cities but a look of state, as of quondam wealth and importance, a little gone down in the world, yet remembering still its former dignity. The northern towns, compared with it, are as the spruce citizen rattling by the faded splendors of an old family-coach in his new-fangled chariot-they certainly have got on before it. Charleston has an air of eccentri- city, too, and peculiarity, which formerly were not deremed unbecoming the well-bred gentlewoman, which her gentility itself sanctioned and warranted--none of the vulgar dread of vulgar opinion, forcing those who are possessed by it to conform to a general standard of gentility, -unable to conceive one peculiar to itself. This " what'll-Mrs.-Grun- dy-say" devotion to conformity in small things and great which pervades the American body-social from the matter of, church-going to the trimming of women's petticoats,- this dread of singularity, which has eaten up all individuality amongst them, and makes their population like so many moral and mental lithographs, and their. houses like so many thousand hideous brick-twins. I believe I am getting excited; but the fact is, that being politically the most free people on earth, the Americans are     256   .AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. socially the least so; and it- seems as though, ever since that little affair of establishing their independence among nations, which they managed so successfully, every Ameri- can mother's son of them has been doing his best to divest himself of his own private share of that great public blessing, liberty. But to return to Charleston. It is in this respect a far f more aristocratic (should I not say democratic?) city than ally I have yet seen in Arierica, inasmuch as every house s:eems built to the owner's particular taste; and in one street you seem to be in an old English town, and in another in some continental city of France or Italy. This variety is extremely pleasing to the eye; not less so is the intermix- ture of trees with the building, almost every house being adorned and gracefully screened by the beautiful foliage of evergreen shrubs. These, like ministering angels, cloak with nature's kindly ornaments the ruins and decays of the mansions they surround; and the latter, time-mellowed, (I will not say stained, and a painter knows the difference,) harmonize in their forms and coloring with the trees, in a manner most delightful to an eye that knows how to appre- ciate this species of beauty." But I am digressing. I wandered on, and on, through the city, till I came to the infected district; in a few yards of the wooden barrier, ere I noticed it. I instantly turned on my heel, and was about retracing my steps, when I saw a beautiful little girl, about eleven years of age, in company with several others, and also a couple of lads, about my own age, crying most piteoesly, and begging the young gentle- men to bring back her little brot her who had crept through a hole in the enclosure, and followed her, dog down into the prohibited district. "Oh! pray, Carson, Richard, one of you go after him? Father will reward you well; besides, I'll remember you as   AMERICAN, NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    257 long as I live. If I could get over the barriers, I would go myself."                       ! '"We'll not do it, Miss. We're not going to risk our lives to save anybody." ( Do then, run home and tell'Pa, or some of the servants ; I hav'nt the heart to go myself."             j "I'll do neither, Miss; wil you, Rich? We're not ser- vants." "My sweet little Miss, appeal to a gentleman whenever you wish a favor, and not to a parcel of conceited, childish fops," cried I, angered at their ill-manners. "No gentle- i man would refuse to do a lady a kindness, especially such a lovely one." "Blushing crimson, and with one of the most grateful 'looks and sweetest smiles I ever Baw, the little girl approached and placed her hand in mine, and with a faltering voice thanked me for my courtesy. I proposed to go after her little brother, but, "no, no!" she exclaimed, with down- cast eyes, " it will be such a risk; but, if you will, then let me go with you?" "The rude blast of the epidemic would wither you like an autumn leaf, so stay here, my little lady, and I'll be back in a few mo-" "But, ere I finished the sentence, one of the rude boys just mentioned, had slipped up behind me, and with a stick, gave me a tremendous blow on the shoulder. Stunned to madness, I wheeled around, and with one fierce blow, felled him to the ground. I then quickly sprang after the other, but he fled, bawling with affaight, at the top of his voice. I returned, sprang over the enclosure, and in a moment was in the prohibited district. What a spectacle met my gaze! Stately mansions uninhabited--streets deserted, doors and windows closed, with not a sound to be heard in the infected district, not even the howl of a dog. Naught grated upon *22*     258   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. the ear save the noise, the hum, and the clamor of the city without. I wandered down through a long street, to the wharf, where I found the renegade, a little curly-headed boy, some four years old, busily playing on the sand-banks. I took him up and retraced my steps with all possible speed. I found all the children had left, except the little girl.- Even the boy I knocked do;i had crawled up and sneaked off. One could scarcely imagine the joy, the extacy, with which the affrighted girl embraced her runaway brother. Releasing him, she grasped my extended hand, exclaiming, "Oh, sir! kind sir! how can I ever repay you?" "By giving me a place in your heart, and a sweet kiss, my little love ;" and bending over her shrinking, trembling form, I touched her pouting lips. 4' Oh! fie! sir, you are -almost as rude as Carson and Richard! but, I must go. Will you be our knight errant home?"  "With all my heart."  So we wended our way down a broad street, for a quarter of a mile, till we came to her father's residence, a large, princely mansion. The little lady invited me to enter, but I drew back, and declined- Finding I could not be prevailed upon to accompany her in, she unclasped a rich pin, containing her miniature, and presented it to me, with the injunction to keep it in remem- brance of her. I accepted it-kissed her hand, and turned upon my heel. The next day I set out for home. "Five years passed away, and I had occasion to visit Charleston again. It was but a few months ago. The incidents that transpired on my first visit, were still green in my memory and thoughts, and visions of the little girl I met in the streets, often time, filled my mind with the most pleasing emotions and yearnings, to behold her again. So, it was with a somewhat bouyant and anxious heart, that I   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     259     made my entree into the ' Queen City.' But how different  , the scene! The former dullness, langour, and lethergy had V disappeared, and in their stead, bustle, life, and animation ? prevailed. I had already been in the city a week, visiting the places of note, with hopes of again seeing the little girl, or rather now spruce damsel, but without avail. I was sitting one evening at a window in my hotel, when I was accosted by a well known voice, from the street: "What! ho! is that you, Maynard? It is, it is, by the life!"I looked down and beheld to my great satisfaction, my old friend Hamilton. In a moment he was in the room, and gave me a right hearty greeting. After the first transports were over, and a hundred trivial questions and answers passed, he began in his own rattling, good-natured, and careless way-"Now, Maynard, after a long absence from our fair city, it is but meet that I should show you the elephant, so that when you return homne, you may astonish the simple and unsophisticated natives by your tales and glimpses of high and fashionable city life. So you must commence even now, and go with me to Mrs. Smith's, this evening; there will be a grand ball-it will be a glorious affair; besides, I will show you my dulcinea. an angel2 a perfect angel, sir. She is wealthy, beautiful, accomplished; has turned the heads of half the city. Her suitors are legion; the most successful of whom, with the exception of myself-ahem! in the eyes of the world, is a Mr. Branson, a perfect popinjay. From his known wealth, great deference is shown him by the parent, but no favor by the lady." "Branson, Carson Branson, did you say? Methinks I should know thiat name-let lme see; but, no, the recollec- tion has slipped my memory-I must be mistaken. Ham- ilton, I'll go with you to-night."     260    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. Two hours afterwards, we entered Mrs. Smith's magnifi- cent saloons. "Hamilton, what tall, heavy-built, piratical-looking man  is that crossing the room?" "Carson Branson, Miss Julia- Dillard's suitor, of whom I spoke. By the way, he is pretty much of a bully.- Conscious of his own physical strength, he seems to fear i none, nor will he be crossed by friend or foe. Teased, flattered, and courted, wealthy, arrogant, and a bully-this is the composition of the man." "After all, Hamilton, he has a gentlemanly mein, and seems-but what lady is that?"I inquired, as we entered the music room. "1 Miss Dillard, the lady of whom I spoke. See what a throng of beaux surround her. Is she not beautiful?" "How can I judge at this distance? Lets draw nearer the fair enchantress and mingle with her gay worshippers.'" replied I, listlessly, for I had already run my eyes over the fair multitude, but without discovering the object of my search. '"But, come, Maynard, let me introduce you. How pale you are; but see, she notices us--she blushes-she smiles --she bows; oh! me; well, I never!" Quick as thought I was at her side, giving and receiving warm greetings, for it was none other than the little girl I had sought long; but now, to my joy, a beautiful lady.- Offering my arm, I led her from her disconcerted admirers, to a seat in a distant part of the room. "How could I forget you, sir? I knew you at first sight." "Indeed! I have a place in your memory, I see ; may I not ask if I have a place in your heart too, as promised me in days 'lang syne?" I ever held you in grateful remembrance." "But the place, gentle lady, I would fain learn more?"   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    261 A toss of her pretty head and a crimson blush was her   i only reply. But I knew it already; the blush, the down- cast look, the trembling tons revealed it; but, above all, the plain, uncouth gold ring I gave her in the streets of the city, years agone, still had a place on her finger, and it i looked oddly enough by the side of the blaze of sparkling  ' gems that graced her hands.                ;: At this moment, the band of music struck up, and the   ;j dances began. "May I have the pleasure of your hand,    ' this set, Miss Dillard?" exclaimed Branson, courteously approaching from a little distance to my right, where he had been glowering on me a full momnent. "I believe I promised to dance with you this set, but t would rather be excused to-night, as I have unexpectedly met an old acquaintance, to whom,-but you will excuse me, sir." A bow and a scowl at me, was the only answer, as he turned away.                     : "The pleasure of your hand, Miss Dillard? The pleasure of your hand this set?"And another, and another came up, but with the like success, and with the rest, Branson, for the second time; ever with his bland manners and in- sulting scowl, which I took good care to return. But I had her all alone to myself that night. I waltzed, I played, I promenaded, I wooed, I won!" "'Well, I never! if you aint a lucky dog," exclaimed Hamilton, as we returned to my rooms, the evening of the party. "A common, plain-looking, country swain, the envy of half the city, to out-wit the whole possee of rich, talented, polished suitors, among whom I have been proud to number myself. Well, there is, indeed and truth, more things in the world, than was dreamed of in my philosophy. Maynard take care, or you'll be shot, if you continue your attentions to Miss Dillard longer. That Branson had his eye on you all evening; wouldn't be surprised if he should     262   AMERICAN NIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENTS. call you out; a capital shot, too, he is; picked his man twenty paces ere to-day!" "Pooh! Hamilton, he will not fight. I'll wager a dozen of champaigne I back him out, if challenged, though I'm no marksman whatever." "I Done, sir, done : would to heaven you may!" Sure enough, next morning, as I sat, discussing with my - friend the merits of our breakfast, who should the servant announce but Mr. Richard Chester, the friend, herald, and boon companion of Branson. "Your servant, gentlemen!-not time to sit :--have the pleasure, Mr. Maynard--or rather it's my painful duty-- to deliver you this billet doux from Mr. Branson," cried Chester, pompously, vainly endeavoring to suppress a fiendish smile of triumph. I took the note and glanced over it: it ran thus: "CHARLESTON HOUSE, No 10,  Thursday, 9 A. M.  } MR. MAYNARD:-Your ungentlemanly conduct, in endea- voring to step between me and one whom I adore, and might justly call my betrothed, with your low, hypocrit- ical manners and soft speeches, deserves satisfaction at my hands; which, if you fail to give, or to leave the city at once, you may expect a horsewhipping on our first meeting.  Mr. Chester .will arrange the preliminaries. I am, CARSON BRANSON." "Umph!" exclaimed I, as I finished the note; cool, this; insulting, too, the rash popinjay!" "No apology, sir; he will receive none. No alternative but to fight. Your time, your arms, your distance, sir?" demanded Chester.   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.    263 Determined to act quite as coolly, I rejoined, "Mr. Hamilton will act as my second; time-one hour hence,     ; sir; place--Mr. Branson's room; arms--pistols; distance breast to breast."                     t "Good Heavens, sir!" exclaimed Chester, horrified; "are you mad? Do you intend downright butchery?" "Sir, I am not a shot, and I'm determined the ruffian you represent shall have no advantage over me. You have . my reply. He must fight or risk the consequences.--Good   I morning, sir!'"                       j An hour after the above conversation we entered Bran-   I son's room, according to appointment. But lo! the lion had left his lair, and in his stead we found three police officers, ready to take us into custody; but upon a fair representation 6f the case by Hamilton, production of the challenge, cowardice of Branson, his flight, etc., they kindly agreed to silence the matter, on our promising not to molest Branson in the future, and to keep the peace, generally; which we most faithfully did; at once gratified at the peaceful termination of the affair, and enraged at the baseness of my antagonist. So you see, Mr. Graham, I was triumphant on all occa- sions;-all, save one. I had distanced my competitors in making love, though against fearful odds; had wooed and won my lady-love, and vanquished my antagonist (by the way, the bully of the town); yet there was, and still is, a ! barrier between me and the goal of my life; and that bar- rier is no other than her father. Although treated by him with courtesy, yet he sternly forbid me his house; for- bid me to see her; forbid the bans .  and why? For no other reason than my poverty. I returned home from Charleston with a heavy heart; my feelings chilled; wounded not so much by my disap- ^      264    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. pointmenlt, as by the misery of the fair, the gentle girl I left behind. Our joint appeals to her father were useless; so I de. parted in a state of distraction, resolved, if there was a name and a fortune in the world, to hew it out by my own exertions, and to rise from poverty and obscurity, above-- far above--those who scorned me in my affliction, and brought me to this disconsolate condition. I left, with the expectation of never seeing her again ; or if so, at some future day, when the star of my destiny rose higher; when fortune, honors, and a name would make me a welcome guest, and a desired, in the proudest families in the State. Faint as was the hope, it was still a hope, a consolation. A few months had only elapsed since my departure from Charleston, when, to the joy of my heart, and at the same time the destruction of my peace, I found Judge Dillard and daughter among the visitors that at this sultry season throng our quiet village. I had seen her but twice since her presence here, and then bystealth, as her father was as obdurate *as ever; and had he known what the fair Julia did, and that this was my place of residence, he never would been prevailed upon to make the visit. I have seen her to-night for the third time. I have now related to you the story of my sufferings, my sorrows, my hopes, my fears, my triumphs, and my disappointments. If you have ever loved as I do, you can feel for, and sympathise with, me. 5My anguish pas- seth show!" "Faint heart never won fair lady, Maynard; so do not despair." "But, sir, my stock of hopes is slender, and I should not deceive my heart-by a delusion." "Methinks I could aid you, Maynard, soften the miser's heart, and make him more reasonable."   AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS.     '65   ! ' You! in Heaven's name, how?" "It matters not; so order up breakfast, and in the mean ; time I will indite a billet doux to your evil genius," and seating myself, I penned as follows: u LAWYERS' ROW, TUESDAY, 6 A.. M.

"' It matters [not; pray reach me the toast;" and we con- tinued our repast in silence, waiting impatiently the return of the messenger, and laboring under far too much anxiety to converse. At last the boy returned. Snatching the note from his hands, I hastily glanced over its contents, which were as follows: C EAGLE HOTEL, } November 2d.  f "DEAR SIR:--Yours came to hand this moment. I acceed to your proposition. Indeed, I find it to the happiness, 23     266    AMERICAN NIGHTS' ENTERTAINMENTS. welfare, and perchance to the life -of my daughter to do so. I opposed their union simply on the grounds of the gentleman's being a stranger, his obscurity and poverty, which were grounds enough for a doating parent. These objections, on reflection, and at your suggestion are set aside. I, as well as my daughter, will be most happy to see you and Mr. Maynard, at my rooms as    L early as you can make it convenient to call. I am, sir, your servant, DILLARD.' Such a cry of joy and astonishment as broke forth from my friend, would have elicited the sympathies and gratula- tions of the most hardened. We started at once for the hotel, and were received with the utmost kindness; all estrangements were healed, and difficulties settled. The engagements matrimonial, were made over again in our presence, by and with the consent L and advice of the father. And, as I had now done what I deemed my duty, I rose, doffed my beaver to the father, pressed the .hand of the bridegroom, kissed the bride, and departed. "Suffer me gentlemen," continued Mr. Graham, "to present to you, the happy whilom bridegroom, Horace Maynard, member of Congress from Tennessee'."    MERCHANT PRINCES.

Mr. Knabe is a native of Germany.       He came to tilis Counttry twenty-seven years ago, and started business with ittle or no capital, other than his trade.  The great secret Df his success is, that he always done his work honestly.- [Ie is now turning out fifteen or twenty Pianos per week, which in point of style, elegance of workmanship, brilliancy, :weetness and volume of tone, cannot be surpassed, or e-ven quailled in this country.

In anticipation of a largely increased number of visitors, the Proprietor has incurred considerable expense in fitting up the premises, not only that he may accommodate more but render all who may favor him with a visit more comfortable and pleasant than formerly. It is useless to comment upon the curative properties of the water as there are hundreds living in almost every section of the Southern States who will testify as to the benefits derived from its use. RHEUMATISM, NEURALGIA, PARALYSIS, &c. All cutaneous affections, and many disease, peculiar only to females, all have been relieved by the persevering and prudent Lse of the water and Bath, which has recently been fitted up entirely new, rendering it much more convenient and pleasant in Bathing.

Conveyances may be had at all times at the Springs. J. A. McDOWELL. [NOTE BY TIIE EDITOR.]--I would state to my Southern       friends that the half has not yet been told by Dr. M'DIOWELL  in the above notice of his celebrated Watering place.   He has said nothing of his "surroundin gs,'" the towering moun- tains, the fragrant groves, the majestic French B road, and all the necessary appliances and appoint-mlents requisite for a perfect Eden.   -le has said nothing of the regular com- pany of chivalric Southerners, who do, and have congregated here annually, "for a period whereof the memorry of man runs not to the contrary."  Of the gentle, the beautiful, the accomplished ladies, the elite of the whole South; of the sweet girls, the generous boys, the self-satisfied planter, and the grave statesman, all mingling pleasantly together.-- Neither has he spoken of his own urbanity, his kind heart, his fatherly- care, nor yet of his savory meats, and good things that crowd his table daily.   Nor yet-but go gentle reader and see for yourself.     VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE RAIL ROAD. From Bristol, Ten., to Lynchburg, Va., distance 204 miles. Hon. JOHN R. McDANIEL, PRES., Lynchburg.        E. H. GILL, SUP., THS Road is the great central connecting link between New Orleans and New York. It has the advantage of being the shortest route, by some hundreds of miles, and conse- quently much cheaper. The Road is smooth and substantial, running through the finest country on which the sun ever shown. On either side of the great valley, the traveller will behold an extended chain of towering mountains; in the valley between, rich and fertile plantations, lovely vil- lages, beautiful farm-houses, and elegant country sites.-- The climate, too, is the finest in the world. The traveller, as he runs up or down the Road, will pass every few stations, some of the most celebrated Watering places in the Union. He will meet with a kind and hospi- table people. He will find the officers of the road to be gentlemen. The President of the Road, a true type of the "old Virginia gentleman;" the Conductors, courteous and accommodating and the Engineers, skillful and accomplished and attentive to their duties.-(ED.) EAST TENNESSEE AND VIRGINIA RAIL ROAD- B. F. McFARLAND, President M. S. TEMPLE, Sup. TmHS Road forms one of the links in the great chain of Roads stretching - direct from New York to New Orleans, and extends from Bristol, where it connects with the Vir- ginia and Tennessee Rail Road, to Knoxville, where it joins the East Tennessee and Georgia Rail Road; a distance of 133 miles. The officers of this Road are well known as gen- tlemen scrupulous in their care for the comfort and safety of . passengers, as well as sobriety and attention to their duties. The Road is in excellent order, and no accident has ever occurred which human foresight and prudence might have prevented. The route lies through a beautiful and romantic portion of the country. The region familiarly known as the "Switzerland of America," can be seen from different points along it. This country is also the scene of the exploits of Sevier, Shelby, Jackson, Davy Crockett, and Sam Houston, names closely allied with some of the most prominent events of American history.--(ED.)   6 I IZ %
