OUR knowledge of the arts of Greece and of the lives of her artists coming to us in fragments, handed down by the dull commentaries of schol- ars and critics, produces little or no effect on the imagination of the uninitiated. Technical words convey no ideas to those who are igno- rant of their signification, and disjointed facts have little weight with those who will not take the trouble to connect them. To place rightly the broken links of a chain of brilliant events, to present to the reader a series of pictures such as arises in the mind on a perusal and careful examination of historical records, has been undertaken by the author as a congenial and, as he hopes, a not unprofitable task. To do this successfully, it seemed to him necessary to treat the subject from a wmodesrn point of view, and to omit all details and indi-     -iv       PREFACE. vidualities not essential to the fidelity of the general effect. In the framing of his plot and the delineation of his principal characters he has, in all the main essentials, been scrupulously faithful to chronology and history. In the pres- ent volume scarcely a paragraph occurs to which he could not have appended a note quoting his authority; but he has preferred to throw himself on the confidence of the reader, with the assurance that he has expressly avoided the manufacture of what a witty friend calls splendid classical delusions." With regard to the plot, if such it may be called, it seemed to him that an easy and natu- ral narrative was better suited to his purpose than the more ambitious and difficult task of arranging striking and startling events. He has aimed at the simple, natural, and quiet char- acter of the plots of Goldoni, rather than that of the thrilling, exciting, and intricate mazes of the modern French drama. Those of his readers who, after a perusal of his book, think it unworthy the name of "A Novel," can call it, what it really is, A WEB OF GRECIAN YARNS.   CONTENTS. CEAPTER                   PAGE I.

Youth and old age have their respective humors; And son, by privilege, can say to father, "Were you not once as young as I am now?" Not so the father; he cannot demand, "Were you not once as old as I am now?" APOLLODORUS.   CHAPTER I. "MOST indefatigable Xylon! will you never finish that design?" asked the volatile Eu- phorus of an elder pupil in the studio of Apel- les. "I have watched you for two tedious hours,--ages they seemed to me, expecting that every touch would be the last, and prom- ising myself the pleasure of your company in a stroll to the theatre; but by the careful mend- ing of your pen, I perceive that your labors are not yet ended." "Have I been so long at work?" exclaimed Xylon. "It seems but a moment since I sat down; so agreeable have I found my occupa- tion, that time has slipped by totally un- heeded." "How I envy you," said Euphorus, with a yawn; "I begin to think I have made a mistake in choosing painting for my profession, so irk-     12        APELLES. some do I find the restraint imposed on my natural propensities." "All rudimentary exercises are irksome at first," replied Xylon, " but are rendered easy by habit, application, and reflection upon the solid advantages resulting from them. What do you find disagreeable in the art?" ' First, by Hercules, paying the enormous fee of a talent to the master under whom I don't study. Secondly, when I would be drawing the faces of fair women, I am obliged to pore over arithmetic and geometry, without which, Apelles constantly tells me, the art cannot be perfected. This whole morning's application has enabled me to demonstrate Pythagoras's proposition, relating to the square of the hy- pothenuse; but how that is to assist me in paint- ing a pair of sparkling eyes, or in imitating the coral and pearls of a virgin's mouth, may the gods destroy me, if I can imagine!" "You are fortunate in being so soon pro- moted to the study of this branch of the art," said the studious Xylon. "I was drilled in mere outline drawing a year longer than you have been. For my part, when Appelles first explained to me the application of the doctrine   THE PUPILS OF APELLES.   13 of numbers to the human form and to the art of composition, a world of light burst upon me. You will acquire it easily, I am convinced, from the rapid progress you have made in drawing." "I was beginning to be disgusted witA it," replied Euphorus, "for in proportion as I im- proved, Apelles became more critical. When I showed him my last copy of one of his draw- ings, he made me correct it three times, each correction consuming an entire day. When I thought it perfect, he advised me to examine it once more, and see if I could not improve it. I suppose I pouted a little, for taking me by the hand, 'My son,' said he, 'I suppose you think you could do better by undertaking a new drawing instead of working upon one of which you begin to tire?'" "' I do,'"I replied. "'In our art,' continued he, 'all that is truly fine comes from study. Genius may strike out a happy conception, but study, thought, and patience alone can refine and perfect the sketch, and add the crowning ornament of grace. Do me the favor to endeavor to make this one perfect, and you will enjoy the reward of having     "       APELLES. done your duty, which will be sweeter than praise.' I worked three days longer upon it, and then carried it to him with the original. Taking up his own drawing, he examined it attentively, saying, 'Very well, exceedingly well.' Then comparing it with mine, 'but stay,' said he, 'which is mine, and which is yours, for I cannot distinguish between the two! Enough, you have passed the first stadion of the art.' " "That was a subtle device of his, to pay you a compliment. I remember he once said the same thing to me. I do not mean to accuse him of insincerity, but I think he was prompted by an amiable desire to pay you the highest and most delicate compliment in his power." "How I love him!" said Euphorus, affec- tionately. "So wise, so gentle, and kind! Be- fore I knew him, I was a sad, mischievous wag; but I should as soon think of pulling the beard of Jove himself as taking any liberties with the amiable and courtly Apelles." "I sometimes think," replied Xylon, his grave features relaxing with a smile, "that his pres- ence is but a temporary stopple to the exuber- ant flow of your spirits, causing them to bubble   THE PUPILS OF APELLES.    15 and foam all the more when it is withdrawn. You are not entirely cured of your waggery!" "I plead guilty to the charge of carrying a boy's head upon a boy's shoulders. That is my mother's ready excuse, whenever my father complains of my buffooneries." "Your mother is of a merry temperament, I believe." "Ay, and has as keen a perception of the ludicrous as a girl of sixteen. "I sometimes throw her into hysterics by the recital of some prank, to which my father listens without a smile or any comment, except an oc- casional Faugh! why will you spoil the boy by encouraging his folly?' I wish you could have seen her laugh at a trick I played upon old Griphos. You know Griphos, our second cook and scullion. He is purblind to such a degree, that when I meet him in the streets I frequently disguise my voice, and make him shake with anger by shouting in his ears, I know thee, slave! Thou art old Griphos, the thief! I saw thee just now steal a pome- granate from the fruiterer's stall! Thy mas- ter shall hear of it!' Instead of suspecting me, he has made me his confidant, and tells     16        APELLES. me that he has a young persecutor in the city who is bent upon driving him mad! "Yesterday evening I had two friends to sup with me in the summer triclinium. Griphos was frying eggs and artichokes, at a small earthern stove in a corner. As he was dish- ing them to serve at table, I saw him slyly thrust something into the hot ashes under the grate. As he is an exceeding glutton, and spends every obolos he can get in pastry, 1 suspected that he was preparing some choice tithit for himself. ' Hark, Griphos,' said I; 'does not my mother call thee? Hasten to her.' As soon as he had gone, I ran to the stove and found, as I had anticipated, a certain fat, oily cake, of which he is very fond, and swears it is made in perfection only by the pastry cook whose shop is at the corner of our street. I hid it under the table, and substituted in its place a stale crust of black bread. He had no sooner returned from his fool's errand than he raked from the ashes the precious morsel for which his mouth was watering, and took a huge bite which nearly broke his front teeth! Spitting the bit upon the floor, he thrust the remains of the crust into the bosom of his tunic,   THE PUPILS OF APELLES.   17 and rushed like a mad bull out of the house. I and my two companions followed him unseen to the cook-shop. We stood at the window, outside, convulsed with laughter as we listened to his vituperation of the portly master of the shop. 'What hoggish knavery is this?' asked he, exhibiting the dirty crust with a gesture of indignation. 'I am a regular customer here, and have always vaunted the pastry of this shop beyond all others. This evening, my young and well-born master entertains some friends at supper, and as I had promised to give them a specimen of your skill, I this morn- ing purchased, as I thought, one of your largest and finest oil-cakes. When the due time for serving it came, lo and behold! it was nothing but a flinty crust of black bread, not fit for a Spartan hound. Do you not remember,' said he, appealing to the cook's daughter, 'that I charged you to give me a fresh cake - one that was crispy?' "' I remember,' said the girl, 'giving thee the best in the basket; that crust came not hence. Thou art drunk.' "Base, lying slave!' shouted the red-faced cook, who could no longer contain himself; 2     1$8       APELLES. 'leave this house instantly, or, by Hercules, I will beat that ass-skin of thine until it will not be worth the tanning!' "We hurried back, and Griphos on his return found us quietly reclining at table, precisely as he had left us. He was loud in his com- plaint of the knavery and deceit which he said was nowadays practised by most respectable tradesmen. He then related the story of his grievances after his own fashion, with sundry amusing amplifications and variations, and ended by tossing the crust upon the table, and, appealing to us, asked whether that was the kind of stuff to be sold by a pastry cook. "Pretending to examine it, I let it fall; and reaching under the table as if to pick it up, I took, instead, the cake which I had previously placed there. ' (I find no fault with it,' said I; ' it is quite fresh, and has an exquisite flavor.' "It was not until he had held it close to his eyes, and then to his nose, that he ventured to taste it again, and you may imagine his amaze- ment and confusion. "' I have tasted no wine to-day,' said he, ' and cannot be drunk. Verily, I am bewitched.'"   THEI PUPILS OF APELLES.    19 "Did you not remember iEsop's fable of the boy and the frogs?" asked Xylon, with a smile. It was sport to you, but death to him." By this time the clepsydra, or water-clock, in- dicated thile hour of repast; and the two friends, after walking together a short distance, parted with rnlltual salutations, each on his way to his owlVn home.

BENEATH the ashes of antiquity lie buried many valuable and interesting truths,-heaps of jewels of such incredible size and splendor as to dazzle the eye of the modern skeptic, and cause him to pronounce them false and of arti- ficial manufacture. Fortunately for our pur- pose, there are some, of whose genuineness time hath not yet effaced the record. Of such, we have selected a few to adorn our tale; and, brushing off the dust and dirt of ages, we pro- pose to exhibit them in modern settings, as- suring the reader that we shall use none whose genuineness cannot be readily proved by refer- ence to authentic ancient writers. The house of Apelles at Pella (the residence of the court of Alexander the Great, in Mace- donia) was conspicuous for its size and ele- gance among the establishments even of the wealthiest citizens. Its marble front, a lofty     24        APELLES. principal story, surmounted by an attic, or sub- ordinate upper story, occupied a length of line double that of the neighboring houses. The main entrance, situated in the centre, was deco- rated by a frontispiece of Corinthian architect- ure, whose architrave bore, in letters of gold, the inscription, ; THE GIFT OF ALEXANDER TO HS FRIEND APEILES.? From the right and left extremities of the front ran two extensive wings; these were connected at intervals by cross-lines of building, dividing the space inclosed into an Atrium, or court, and two ample Peristyles, or open quadrangles, sur- rounded by a continuous colonnade, adorned with honeysuckles, intermingled with the unde- ciduous grape-vines of Elephantine. Tie grass- plots in the centre were decorated by fountains, statues, vases, and flowering shrubs. The front contained a vestibule, with a suite of reception rooms on the right, and on the left a picture-gallery, library, and a small studio. The right wing was devoted to the domestic apartments, such as Triclinia, or dining-rooms, separate sleeping apartments for the women of   THE FAME AND FORTUNE OF APELLES. 25 the family, dressing-rooms, and baths. The op- posite wing was divided into large and magnifi- cent apartments reserved for the lodging and entertainment of guests. The rear was occu- pied by kitchens, offices, and store-rooms. The large number of domestics and slaves required for the service of an establishment of such mag- nitude found ample accommodation in the attic, which was devoted entirely to their use. The whole was surrounded by a large and highly cultivated garden. It had been the property of a wealthy mer- chant, whose enormous fortune, divided among a number of heirs, left no one rich enough to support such an establishment; it was sold at auction, and the proceeds were divided. Alex- ander purchased the estate at its full value, and presented it to his favorite painter, Apelles. The surprise expressed by his courtiers, that such munificence should be lavished upon a mere artist, gave rise to the memorable answer of Alexander, (erroneously attributed to Henry VIII. and Francis I.,) "I can create kings and nobles at pleasure, but not an Apelles." Alexander was a frequent visitor at Apelles's studio, and some idea of their intimacy may be     26        APELLES. formed from the well known anecdotes that, when Apelles once dropped his pencil, Alex- ander stooped to pick it up; Apelles received it with bended knee, saying, " he king, ill his love of art, forgets that I am his servant." "Talk not of servants," replied the gracious monarch.  If I am king of Macedonia, thou art the king of painters; between kings there should be no ceremony; they are brothers." The fame of Apelles was, at the period of our story, at its culminating point. He had not only outstripped all his contemporary rivals, but had carried the art to a point of perfection un- known to his predecessors. To estimate prop- erly the preeminent height to which his brilliant genius had raised him, we must remember that Polygnotus, Parrhasius, and Zeuxis were in his day revered old masters. Polygnotus Was the Giotto, Parrhasius the Raphael, and Zeuxis the Titian of the Grecian schools. Parrhasis, who excelled in drawing, perfected the laws of symmetry by means of mathematical formulas; and when we learn from undoubted authority that the canon of form invented by him for the proportions of a Venus was considered so perfect that no succeeding painter or sculptor   THE FAME AND FORTUNE OF APELLES.  '27 deviated from it, we may have some idea of the drawing of the Grecian school. But it was the boast of Apelles's scholars that their master had united all the excellences of his rivals and prede- cessors in his perfect style, and that he excelled them all individually in his execution. Lastly, by the invention of a new process,* (familiarly known to modern artists by the name of g glaz- in,") he contrived to heighten or subdue at pleasure the brilliancy of his colors, and gave to his pictures a glowing light and freshness which distinguished them as jewels of the first water among the flat, cold, and labored produc- tions of his nearest rivals. His exquisitely pro- portioned figures, most accurately drawn and brilliantly colored, were executed with such ease and dexterity of handling, that they gave no in- dication of his intense study and labor, but seemed as if created by a mere act of volition, or the fiat of a teeming imagination. Of the beauty and perfection of these works we moderns can form but a vague and inade- quate idea. That they excelled all modern paintings, as much as the antique sculptures surpass those of the present day, can be doubted X See Pliny, 1. c. s 18, and Sir Joshua Reynolds's Discourses. I! T      28        APELLES. only by such as have neglected to examine the indisputable proofs which have been gradually accumulated by careful gleanings from the pages of antiquity. The writings of Cicero and Pliny throw great light on this important and interest- ing subject. That they were competent judges, cannot be doubted by the artist who finds in their criticisms (those of Cicero, especially) evi- dences of a thorough knowledge of all the high- est principles of art. If it be urged that in the absence of any really fine specimens of the art of painting, these writers would naturally " employ the best words to describe the best things existing at the time," it must be remembered that modern excava- tions at Pompeii have brought to light frescoes and mosaics, whose drawing and composition give evidence of a high school of systematic art, the depth of whose principles all the acu- men of modern criticism and analysis has not yet been able to fathom. Yet these remains are evidently the productions of third and fourth rate artists, such as house decorators, and me- chanical mosaic copyists, executed at a time when the works of Apelles were the wonder of Rome, as those of Titian and Raphael are now r   THE FAME AND FORTUNE OF APELLES.     29 the despair of the artists of London and Paris. Now, as Cicero had carefully studied all the most eminent masters in Greece and     had  a favorite villa at Pompeii only a few years pre- vious to its destruction, we cannot doubt that he was familiar with the finest specimens of that school, whose excellences, reflected by in- ferior artists, have excited and baffled the in- genuity of the ablest modern critics. The prices which Apelles received for his pictures seem  fabulous, but are too well au- I thenticated to admit of a doubt.  The intrinsic value of the mere coin paid to him for the pic- ture of Venus Anadyomene, painted for the temple of JEsculapius at Cos, when estimated by the present standard of value of silver, ex- ceeds the entire fortune left by the wealthy and successful Titian at his death.  It was no less a sum than 100 talents, equivalent to 20,000 pounds sterling  according to  our standard;  * Table of the intrinsic worth of Greek Coins, measured by the present value of silver. 1 Lepton     = $0.0004, or -4 of a mill. 7 Lepta = 1 Chalcus = 0.0034 or 3 -4 mills. 8 Chalcoi === 1 Obolos == 0.0277, or 2 cents 7-7 mills. *6 Oboloi=' 1 Drachna -= 0.1666, or 16 cents 66 mills 100 Drachmai = 1 WlMna =16.6666, or 16 dollars 66 cents 60 mills. 60 Mnai = 1 Talantoi (Talent) = $1,000, or one thousand dollars. ']     30        APELLES. but the value of money changes like that of other commodities; and as the pay of a jury- man was at that day only two oboloi per diem, and  the salary of an ambassador only four drachmas per diem, we may safely conclude that the value of money was at that time five times greater than at present, which would bring the price of this picture to the round sum of 100,000, or half a million of dollars! An immense fortune derived from the sale of his pictures and the generosity of his royal patrons, for he had been the favorite of Philip as well as Alexander, enabled him to support a princely style of living and frequently to entertain guests of distinction in a manner conforming to their rank and condition. From his earliest youth his companions had been poets and philosophers. Thoroughly drilled in all the exact sciences, which were carried to a point not dreamed of until lately by the mod- erns, he was in full possession of all the treas- ures of history, poetry, and literature of the day. The amenity of his courtly manners, and the charms of his varied conversation made him a fitting companion for princes and nobles. As an instance of his generous nature, it is related   THE FAME AND FORTUNE OF APELLES.  31 that, on visiting Rhodes where he found Pro- togenes unappreciated by his fellow-citizens, he purchased one of his pictures for the sum of fifty talents, or 10,000, and gave out that he had bought it on speculation, expecting to realize a large profit from its sale. Such was the fortune, character, and stand- ing of the artist, a portion of whose brilliant career we have undertaken to illustrate. Ir A,     THE      THUNDERER.

THE small studio mentioned in our brief de- scription of Apelles's house, having a steady northern light, was appropriated by him to the study of careful outline drawing and effects of light and shade. As it was a maxim with him never to pass a day without drawing,"* he in- variably began the day by devoting an hour or two to this important exercise. A later hour found him in a larger apartment, with a south- ern exposure, whose warm and genial light he fancied gave increased power and brilliancy to his coloring In this studio, his painting-room, he was seated one morning contemplating a full-length portrait of Alexander, celebrated in after ages under the title of o Kepavvoorpow, or "The Thun- derer." In this picture, he had represented his royal patron in the character of Jupiter Tonans. a "Nullat dies sine lineb." Maxim attributed to Apelles by ,-4  "cPliny.     36        APELLES.    / S Against a background of ethereal azure, a god- like form was seated in naked majesty upon a cloud, his right hand raised in the act of hurling a glittering thunderbolt, while the. royal  bird of Jove cowered in terror at his feet. The  dignity of the altitude was heightened by the expression of the countenance and a dazzling  brilliancy of color, which filled the eye of the beholder with veneration and awe. The painter,  who had put the last finishing touch to his pic-  ture, smiled upon it, and internally pronounced it his best work. Euphorus and Xylon, who had been admitted to view it, stood silently be-  fore it in breathless admiration.  Euphorus was the first to speak. "I cannot conceive by what magical effect of coloring the  right hand is made to stand out in such bold relief from the panel. That hand and arm are  glowing with the light of the thunderbolt; and ;  yet the face of the god, which is much further back, preserves the local color of flesh as fully ; as if it were painted in the foreground! Al- though the tone of coloring is much lower than : that of the hand, I see the rich mantling of the  cheeks and lips heightening the fairness of an exquisite complexion."  ;,   THE THUNDERER.      37 Apelles looked pleased. "I am glad that you have noticed this peculiar effect, for I flattered myself that I had been happy in my attempts to produce it. In painting the face, I was obliged to use all my tints of the deepest and richest tone, and their brilliancy arises from a careful study to keep them pure in juxtaposition with one another, instead of blending them to- gether. The harmony which painters generally effect by blending their coloring was in this case produced by a slight coat of glazing. I consider it my most successful effort. May the gods grant that it may be many years before -men shall know the form and features of the king only through this portrait. The life of a warrior," he continued, with a sigh, " is always uncertain; and I shudder to reflect that all his important victories have been gained chiefly by his impet- uous courage, and reckless exposure of his own life." A slave here entered and announced that the king awaited Apelles in the front recep- tion-room. "Long life to Alexander!" and "Health to Apelles!" were the salutations, as the two friends clasped right hands.   38        APELLES i The youthful monarch was now in the flower of manly beauty. A truly majestic bearing gave additional grace to an exquisitely moulded fig- ure, and to the expression of faultless features. r Over a tunic of white Milesian wool, reaching to his knees, was thrown a scarlet mantle, em- broidered with gold; his sword, belt, and sandal lacings sparkled with jewels. On his head he -  wore a golden helmet of choicest workmanship, : the crest of which was a dragon, in whose mouth an enormous diamond, reflecting the pris-  matic rays of light, shone like a trembling star  over the head of a demi-god. Although only  twenty-one years of age, and in the first year of his reign, he had for five years been inured X to the vicissitudes of the camp and the dangers of the battle-field. At the age of sixteen, which in our northern climates rarely marks the age of puberty, he had by his personal bravery won for his father Philip the battle of Cheroneia, which decided the destinies of Greece.  "My friend," said Alexander, motioning to  the painter to take a seat beside him, " in a day or two I propose to send an embassy to Athens, and the object of my visit this morning is to inquire whether you are willing to join it?" I s   THE THUNDERER.      39 "The king has only to command, even my life," replied the loyal subject. "Thanks, gentle Apelles, your life is too dear to me to be placed in any danger. Your mis- sion is one of peace. Not that I mean to im- pose on you the uncongenial task of diplo- macy, but by joining the train of the embassy you can render me several important services. "You are aware that during this first year of my reign my throne has not been a bed of roses. On the death of my father Philip, the confederate states of Greece threw off the Macedonian supremacy, while the barbarians of the north threatened my dominions. Prompt measures were required. Thebes, which had been most active in the revolt, readily submitted and sued for pardon when I, by a rapid march, appeared before her gates. The other states fol- lowed her example, with the exception of Lace- demonia; and at an assembly held at Corinth I was elected to command an expedition against Persia, as formally as my father had previously been. Returning home I made preparations for my northern expedition. An army of thirty thousand warriors is ready to march. In the mean time rumors of renewed rebellious move-   40        APELLES.           i ments at Thebes and Athens daily come to my ears. Demosthenes, Hypereides, and other Athe- nian orators vie with each other in denouncing me, and falsely accuse me of having broken my faith pledged in solemn treaty. Darius is send- ing large sums of money to the Athenians, and must be counteracted. My ambassadors will offer conditions, accompanied by threats in case of refusal, which make me confident of their acceptance. Thus I shall be able to put my plans in operation at once. "The ostensible object of your mission is to purchase pictures, statues, and books, to en- rich my collections here. My friend and former instructor, Aristotle, has, after an interval of seven years, resumed his lectures at Athens. I have other friends there who form a strong party in my favor. They must be increased! Among my opponents are many needy men who are influenced only by what they think their interest; they must be bought! "This, however, forms no part of your com- mission. I know the Athenian character well enough to be sure that an artist of your emi- nence will be everywhere well received; and I trust to the devotion of your friendship to keep   THE THUNDERER.       41 alive among the most cultivated Athenians a sentiment favorable to my cause. We have had many conversations together, and you un- derstand my sentiments and policy, which are studiously misrepresented at Athens." This proposition, so flattering to the artist, was the result of Alexander's high appreciation of his fiiend's social and intellectual qualities. He reflected that so illustrious a person as Apelles, a man of elegant and insinuating man- ners, would be welcomed with rapture in the clubs and the refined society of Athens; the best houses would be thrown open at his ap- proach; he would be invited to every fashiona- ble and literary symposium; and the part he would take in the artistic, scientific, political, and philosophical discussions, considering his well known intimacy with the youthful monarch, could not fail to hold in check whatever ten- dencies there might be among the more culti- vated Athenians to make an attempt to assert the supremacy of the Dernos. Apelles expressed his sense of the honor which his royal master had conlferred upon him, and his pleasure in embracing an opportunity of visiting Athens and executing so congenial   42        APELLES. a commission as the purchase of works of art. "I have much to say to you," resumed Alex- ander, "which must be deferred until dinner- time, when I hope the pleasure of your company at the palace. I am momently expecting the  arrival of some friends who are desirous of seeing your works. How  comes on 'the     4 Thunderer?

"For it made me mad, To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet, And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman." SHAKESPEARE.    CHAPTER IV. IN compliance with the request of their mas- ter, the two pupils were standing on either side of the open door of Apelles's painting-room, as Alexander, followed by a train of courtiers, ap- proached. In the pale and nervous features of one, a careful observer would have recognized the timid, shrinking, and snail-like disposition of Xylon; while the sparkling eye and ani- mated expression of his companion indicated the buoyant and excitable temperament of Eu- phorus. As Alexander, walking with Apelles, conversed with him in a low and confidential tone, the others followed at a respectful dis- tance. The slowness of their ceremonious entrance enabled Euphorus to overhear the remarks of a voluble speaker, who was one of the last to enter. "What is the name of this Phoenix of paint- ers?" asked he, in a slow, distinct, but drawling tone.   "       APELLES. "Apelles."  "Mine ears have been sadly bored of late by  a constant repetition of monotonous syllables. On my way to this capital, I heard of nothing but 'Pella! Pella!' The very frogs of the marshes through which the Lydias flows croaked 'Pella! Pella!' 'What lake is that?' asked I of my guide; he answered, ' The lake of Pella.' And those baths, undoubtedly, are fed by a perennial spring. What is its name?' 'The spring of Pella.' And now you tell me that your great painter is Apelles, Apelles!" "Who is that contemptible fop?" asked Xy- lon of Euphorus. The two pupils were standing  near the door, while the ceremony of presenting his friends individually to Apelles was performed { by Alexander. "It is Phileterus, nicknamed ' The Peacock.' He is an ambassador to this court from Sybaris, a city renowned above all others for the luxury of its inhabitants. He appears to be a fair specimen of his effeminate countrymen. He laments the parsimony of those who administer public affairs, and boasts that his entire salary only pays the wages of his cook, the rest of his expenses being defrayed out of his private for- -,.i l :Aor   A SYBARITE.       47 tune. At last their ceremonies are ended. W-hat a noble presence and bearing distinguishes the king! He has, as you know, a slight but not ungraceful inclination of the head towards the right. "His courtiers, in the emulation of their flattery, seem unable to caricature sufficiently this peculiarity. Behold them now arrayed in a long line, with their necks awry to such a de- gree that I can think of nothing but a row of chickens upon a roost, all afflicted with the pip. Philetmerus has just given his neck an extra wring, which seems to indicate that his last minute has arrived." Peace, Euphorus; your loud conversation will be overheard!" said Xylon, cautiously. Apelles here motioned to his pupils to assist him in moving the picture into a favorable light. As soon as it was adjusted, a unanimous ex- clamationofIE of Ey es or " bravo, was fol- lowed by a few moments of silent admiration. Each one discovered some striking excellence, which he commented upon in terms equally complimentary to the artist and the sitter. Phileterus, who piqued himself upon the pos- session of a most refined and exquisite taste, was the only one who ventured to offer a criti-   48        APELLES. cism. "I know nothing of art," said he, with  affected modesty, "but, with the permission of the renowned Apelles, will venture a suggestion : for his consideration. I admire, with all of you, : the wonderful power and brilliancy of the right hand holding the thunderbolt, but cannot but  regret that it is effected by the entire sacrifice of a more important feature, namely, the face,  which is represented as less fair, nay, dark and  swarthy, in comparison with that of the origi- nal. Observe," continued he, placing his own  small and delicately formed hand before the pic-  ture, "what a contrast!--and yet, my corn- plexion is much darker than that of the king."  "Pardon me," said Apelles, smiling; "that is  hardly a fair test. The different parts of a pic- ture should be compared with one another, not with sensible and tangible objects. It is like expecting a poet, who describes a flower, to cre- ate its perfume by the mere use of words."  "This indisputable defect," resumed the critic,  "offends my taste, however, less than the posture of the figure. The introduction of a downy velvet cushion would have added richness of ' color, and have given a certain air of ease and regal state, which I find wanting. The sight   A SYBARITE.       49 of a naked figure, seated upon a cold, damp cloud, sends a shuddering chill through my whole nervous system like that of an ague; my teeth actually chatter." During the latter part of this speech, he slowly receded, step by step, towards a chair, in order to repose after the delivery of this elaborate specimen of Sybarite refinement. Ob- serving his motions, Euphorus, who was hold- ing a pallet richly laden with an assortment of fresh colors, slyly and unobserved by all, placed it upon the seat of the chair, into which the ambassador sank with an air of exhaustion. Mistaking the smile of contempt visible on the countenances of his hearers for one of ap- plause, he continued: "In my travels, I have seen many exquisite specimens of the noble art of painting, but none which affected my imag- ination so powerfully as one by Zeuxis, repre- senting Dirce bound to a savage bull. The composition, drawing, and coloring were all faultless; but the most striking feature of the picture, which riveted the eye of the beholder, was the tail of the animal, which was painted in such a masterly manner that it actually pro- truded two cubits from the plane of the picture. 4 50        APELLES.           .A Ye gods, such a triumph of art! such a brill- iant effect of coloring!" Here he rose and stalked up and down the room like an actor on the stage after the deliv- ery of a fervent burst of eloquence. The sight of his robe, besmeared with all the colors of the i rainbow, caused a universal shout of laughter. Phileterus paused and looked around with an expression of inquiring amazement.  "My friend," said Alexander, scarcely able to  speak articulately, "hadst thou been seated  Ad upon a cloud, it had been far easier to have  wrung the folds of thy garment free from mois- ture, than to remove the rich effect of coloring which now adorns thy person." The heart of Philetterus failed him when, to  his consternation, he learned the cause of their merriment; but he was too thoroughly drilled in the art of self-possession to betray his emo- tion. "Look you, my friends," said he, exhibit-  ing the woful plight of his raiment, " see what magical changes can be effected in a moment!  This tunic cost me fifty talents, and I will now  sell it for as many drachmas."  "Nay," said Apelles, " the damage is less se-  rious than you imagine. These are only water o;i*   A SYBARITE.       51 colors. Euphorus shall conduct you into the next room, where a slave, who is expert in the business, shall restore your robe to its primitive whiteness." "Why is it, my Apelles," asked Alexander, as the figure of the crestfallen ambassador van- ished through the open doorway, " that when an ignorantly presumptuous person ventures to ex- press his opinion in matters of art, he always prefaces his remarks by a declaration that he has no knowledge of the subject? Surely, this should be a strong inducement for him to keep silence." "' I think that an inordinate self-conceit leads him to arrogate to himself a natural and instinc- tive acumen superior to the knowledge of those who have made a study of art." Alexander, turning sharply round towards Euphorus, who had just returned, fixed upon him a serious and steady look. "Tell me, youth, was it an accident which befel our am- bassador, or had you a hand in contriving it?" Euphorus colored slightly, but without hesita- tion replied, "I will not add to my indiscretion, O king, the crime of falsehood. I placed the pallet on the seat purposely."  52        APELTLES.          : "And wherefore?" asked Alexander. "I was irritated by his impertinent criti- cism of the best parts of my master's work. The thought of making him appear ridiculous was the impulse of a moment, which made me forget what was due to your royal pres- ence." Alexander smiled graciously, and, drawing from his finger a ruby ring, made with it a gesture of sealing the lips of all present, and presented it to Euphorus, with a purse of gold. "Not a syllable of this to Philetwerus. Take these as a reward, first for your impulsive cour- age, and secondly for your frank and manly con- fession. From this specimen of your truth I would trust you with untold gold." Euphorus silently bowed a graceful acknowl- edgment of the unexpected honor, and retired to the side of the astonished Xylon, who had anticipated a very different catastrophe. After an absence of a few minutes, Philet e- rus returned with a radiant countenance and spotless garment. Alexander, charging Apelles to be punctual at dinner, added in a whisper, "You must take the youth Euphorus with you   A SYBARITE.    ,   53 to Athens; lhe is a boy after my own heart; his company will amuse you, and in case of any emergency, I am sure he will not Iack presence of mind or courage." He then de- parted, evidently in the best of humors, towards his home, escorted by his companions.    PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.     "Farewell, my friend, for know that [ Through pleasant lands must roam,  To where Minerva stands on high, To guard her sacred home: To Athens' towers and Plato's bowers  And groves whose learned shade           X And checker'd light fill with delight The pensixe, blue-eved Maid." ANONYMOUS. 5tp ?i4 )i   CHAPTER V. AT an early hour of the morning, Euphorus was summoned by Apelles, and learned with inexpressible joy that his master was about to make a journey to Athens, and that by the permission of the king he was to accompany him. On the previous evening, when Apelles dined at the palace, he received a small package of letters, and a brief memorandum, the heads of which Alexander read to him separately, making verbal explanations and comments un- til the list of commissions, accompanied by counsels and advice, was finished. The neces- sary preparations, which Apelles had imag- ined would cause at least a week's delay, had already been made, and every order issued with military precision. Nothing remained for him and his pupil, but to hold themselves in readiness to join the train of ambassadors by daybreak of the following morning. Horses     58        APELLES. and carriages for the travellers had been or- dered, as well as wagons for the transport of provisions and money. They were to be es- corted by soldiers from the citadel, who were to be exchanged at each of the Macedonian garrisons, which occurred at short intervals throughout all Greece. 'I congratulate you, my son, on your good fortune in having an opportunity of studying the finest specimens of art under such favorable auspices. The consent of your parents will, I doubt not, be readily granted. By the by," said he, smiling, "I have a message for you from the king. Tell your ingenious young pupil,' said he, 'that if he would win the heart of my old friend and tutor Aristotle, I can put him in a way to do so. In his letters to me he frequently speaks of the pleasant days he formerly spent here on the shore of the lake of Pella, and expresses a hope of again enjoying the exquisite flavor of its fish, one of which, the chromis, he says, is the most delicate in the world. They are now in perfection, being always fat- test at this season of the year. They may be carried alive in tanks or can be packed in snow. In this latter mode I have frequently   PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.   59 transported fresh provisions for my army to a great distance.* I count upon his adroitness to contrive an agreeable surprise for the old philosopher.' It is unnecessary," concluded Apellcs, "for me to suggest to you that such a hint from the king amounts to a com- mand." Euphorus expressed his thanks warmly, and assuring his master that he would spare no pains in the execution of his commission, hastened to make the necessary preparation. His first care was to ascertain from Griphos the name and residence of the fisherman who supplied his father's table. Knocking at the door of the hut, he was saluted by the fisher- man himself. "How many live and fat chromis of the largest size can you catch for me before dinner- time?" asked Euphorus. "Look ye, noble master," said he, pointing to a series of large tanks through which a cool and sparkling brook was flowing. "In these tanks I have a stock of fish sufficient to supply the king's table on any occasion. You can choose for yourself." He raised the lid of a * Athen., III. 97.     60        APELLES. tank and exhibited with pride some thirty or forty of the largest and fattest, whose silver sides contrasted beautifully with the clean bed of yellow pebbles beneath them. Euphorus soon concluded a bargain for the whole, and ordered them to be put into large earthen jars of water. He also ordered a quan- tity of a freshwater plant of which the fisher- man said they were very fond. "Change the water every morning," said he, " and give them food, and you may carry them as far as Egypt." Send them to the house of Apelles within two hours, and I will give three drachmas in addition to the price." "' What's next to be done?" asked Euphorus on his way home. "Let me see. I may as well ask my father's consent before making any other arrangements." Entering the library, he seated himself by the side of his mother who was engaged in embroidery, and, unnoticed by his father, began to relate the trick which he had played upon Philetaerus the day before. When he described the ludicrous effect of the ambassador's appearance on rising,-"Faugh!" exclaimed the old man, throwing down his   PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.  61 book in a great passion; "is the boy mad to play such a vile and malicious prank, and then to laugh at it. Had you been known as the author, I should have been disgraced forever. I hope you had the wit to make it appear to be an accident?" "On the contrary, I confessed to the king that I had done it with malice prepense." "' Thou art then decidedly insane," said the old man, in utter consternation. "What said he?" "He gave me this ring, and a purse of gold, and furthermore wishes me to join an embassy to Athens with my master Apelles. For this reason I come, as in duty bound, to ask your consent." "With all my heart. May the gods go with thee and give thee a little wisdom." So say- ing, he resumed his reading as calmly as if he had not been interrupted. His mother kissed him with affectionate glee, and pronised to attend to the packing of his wardrobe, while he went to take leave of Xylon. "Give me joy, my friend," said he, entering the studio where Xylon was hard at work.     62        APELILES. "To-morrow I go to Athens! the home of art and beauty!" He then enumerated, in a hurried and voluble manner, the pleasures and sights which he an- ticipated, the buildings and the theatres, baths, and public walks, the splendid pageants and stately pomp of the most brilliant capital of the world. "' Am I not lucky?" asked he. "You are indeed," said Xylon, in a tone of unfeigned pleasure and sympathy. A faint and sad smile stole over his features, as he con- tinued: "Your adventures of yesterday con- trast strangely with mine of the day before. I was invited by my uncle to join a large party whom he entertained at his villa near the lake. I was disinclined to go, but was persuaded by my mother, who said that a little country air and recreation would do me good. When I was apparelled for the occasion, she called me and said, ' It is not well for you to be in the company of rich and noble strangers without money in your purse.  Here are ten gold darics,* fresh from the mint. You can take them, but need not spend them all.' I thanked her, and told her that I had a few silver pieces, ' A Persian coin, current in Macedonia and Greece.   PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.   63 (some four or five drachmas,) and should prob- ably have no occasion to change the gold. "At my uncle's I found a large party as- sembled. A number of the king's body-guard contributed much to the gayety of the scene by the splendor of their uniforms. Their un- couth Thracian dialect made it difficult for me to converse with them; and knowing very few of the ladies, I had a stupid time of it until dinner, when the conversation became general and amusing.  After dinner, as I passed the door of the aleatorium, I saw a number of the officers seated at play. As there was no money on the table and they were throwing dice for colored ivory counters alone, I con- cluded to join the sport. I soon became in- terested in the game, and played with indif- ferent success for, an hour or more, when the party broke up. I could not imagine why they all calculated the value of their counters so carefully, until one of them, running over my pile, informed me that I had lost nine darics. It seems that they were playing for money, and that the counters were used as a convenient representative until the final settle- ment. I paid my money with the best grace     "       APELLES. I could, and strolled into the garden to hide my vexation and vain regrets. In the centre of the garden I found a cage of parrots hang- ing over a large and deep basin of clear water, supplied by a fountain. I had heard much of these parrots, and endeavored to make them talk in vain. I remembered having heard that the sight of any bright object would excite them; so I took out my last gold piece and held it close to the eyes of the largest bird in the cage. With a motion quicker than light- ning, he gave it a dab with his beak and knocked it into the very centre of the basin, where I saw it lying on the bottom in a depth of water twice over my head. It was impossible to get at it, and I was sorely tempted to drown myself with it from sheer vexation." A tear-drop stood trembling on his eyelid, as he threw his arms around Eu- phorus's neck, saying, ' I do not envy your happiness, for I love you and rejoice with you; but tell me, is it not hard to receive nothing but frowns from the goddess who seems to reserve all her sunniest smiles for my friend?" "Say not so," said Euphorus, who was   PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY.  65 sensibly touched by his dejection. "I should not deserve the favors of fortune if I did not share them with my best friend." Emptying the contents of Alexander's purse upon the table, he divided it into two equal piles of fifty pieces each, and bade Xylon to choose. "Have you not always given me a full half of all your apples and cakes? Take the half of this gold and make me doubly happy." By such arguments as these Xylon was finally induced to accept his friend's proposal, and went home with a heavier purse and lighter heart. 5 , I     IN   AhTHENS.-Am VISIT TO ARISTOTLE.

PARADISE REGAINED. { )   CHAPTER VI. THE middle of April, in the second year of the 111th Olympiad, (B. C. 335,) found the Macedonian embassy nigh the end of its jour- ney. At Thebes they viewed with enthusiasm the lofty heights of Parnassus, whose summit seemed to pierce the western sky. The house in which King Philip passed his time, when, in his youth, he was detained as a hostage, availing himself of the opportunity of learning the prin- ciples of the art of war from Epaminondas, was pointed out to the travellers as they passed it. At the house of Pindar, they were shown the chair in which, so tradition says, the great poet sat composing those Epinician odes which have been the despair of all succeeding lyric poets down to the present day. At Eleusis, Apelles would have been pleased to renew his association with the city which he had not visited since his youthful initiation into     70        APELLES. the Eleusinian Mysteries, and, ascending the citadel, to enjoy the effect of the sunlight play- ing on the sparkling waters of her lovely bay; but Athens was nigh, and they pressed onward to the Pass of Eleusis, which brought it directly in sight. "Is this a city inhabited by men, or rather the dwelling-place of the immortal gods?" ex- claimed Euphorus, when a full view of Athens, bathed in the golden light of sunset, burst upon his eyes. "This is Athens, the beloved of Minerva!" replied Apelles. "Behold how majestically she presides, towering in colossal grandeur above the heights of the Acropolis, her brazen shield and spear glittering with sunlight. What a gorgeous effect of color! Behold the groves of Plato's academy; how finely the emerald foliage contrasts with the gilded boughs and branches, shining like rods of gold! All the ultramarine of Byzantium would feebly imitate the deep glowing and diaphanous blue and purple with which Mounts Parnes, Pentelicus, and Hymet- tus are painted in the distance. How beauti- fully the city rises on the sloping hillside! What lines of marble porticos are wound   ATHENS.-A VISIT TO ARISTOTLE.  71 around it, with groves of columns rivalling in number the trunks of pines in a forest! Above all, the Acropolis, or walled citadel, stands, a solid base of rock, like a pedestal for the sup- port of the Parthenon, the Erectheum, and Pro- pylvea." On entering the city, by the Sacred Way, which led through the Ceramicus, between rows of sepulchres of illustrious men, and the crowded Agora, thence along the southern side of the Acropolis, Euphorus was surprised to see interminable lines of citizens, in holiday robes, pouring forth from the numerous doors of a co- lossal structure on the southeast corner of the Acropolis. Thousands upon thousands had al- ready gone forth in orderly procession, and still there seemed no end of their numbers. "It is a day of festival," said Apelles, " and the citizens have been witnessing some dra- matic performance in the Dionysiac Theatre, dedicated to Bacchus. It is said to contain thirty thousand people, so that this motley throng presents to your eye the exact number of armed warriors with whom Alexander is probably now crossing the Hewmus, to subdue the barbarians of the north."     72        APELLES. Taking a circuitous route, in order to avoid the obstructed thoroughfares of the city, Apelles and his pupil were conveyed with their baggage to a well appointed evo;oxeJov, or inn, near the Dionman Gate, where an excellent supper and luxurious apartments enabled them to repair, by a good night's rest, the fatigues of their long journey. When the light repast of the next morning was despatched, Apelles, examining his memo- randum, informed Euphorus that their first duty was to pay a visit to a man of the greatest lit- erary eminence in Athens, -to the learned and accomplished Aristotle. A domestic conducted them a short distance only, when he halted before an ebony door in- laid with polished brass, saying, "This is the house of Aristotle." On knocking, they were admitted, and Apelles and Euphorus were ushered into the library, while their attendant waited in the vestibule. They were gracefully welcomed by the philos- opher, the cordial urbanity of whose manners soon put Euphorus entirely at his ease. "I am most happy," said he, after perusing the letter of Alexander, " to meet Apelles, whose   ATHENS.-A VISIT TO ARISTOTLE.  73 works I have seen with so much pleasure. I feel that we shall be friends, for we have many bonds of sympathy. We both love and esteem the same noble and generous patron. May the gods long preserve his life. Every year adds to the list of my obligations and gratitude. This letter announces to me a third present of the sum of a hundred talents, for which the only return I am expected to make is a devotion of my time to the congenial study of natural history and letters. His captains by sea and land have orders to procure for me specimens of animals, birds, fishes, plants, and flowers from every quarter. My museum at this mo- ment requires the employment of a large num- ber of students, besides artists and clerks. In fact," continued he, smiling, "I see no end to my investigations, so long as I am permitted to live on earth. What are your plans for the day?" "I had proposed," said Apelles, "to devote this morning to my young friend, who must make the acquaintance of your beautiful city. This is his first visit to Athens." ' I shall gladly be your guide, and we can enjoy the pleasures of conversation during our     74        APELLES. walks. I must insist, however, on your becom- ing my guests, for Alexander's express wish en- titles me to claim that honor. Let me show you the apartments I propose for you." He led the way through a number of well furnished rooms to a large reception saloon of a most cheerful aspect, connected at either end with bedrooms which promised to afford every luxury of accommodation. "You are now at home," said he. ("A servant is in waiting in the corridor, who will attend to all your wants. I must leave you for a few moments, to order your baggage to be removed hither from your inn. I shall see that it is properly cared for," said he, with a smile, " for the king informs me that it contains a chest of gold belonging to me." He had no sooner left the room, than Eupho- rus, opening the opposite door, saw a young slave, who rose from his seat, saying, '"Com- mand me." Euphorus gently closed the door, and said, "Send to me your master's cook; I have some- thing private to say to him; and, look ye, you may conduct him to my bedroom,-that on the right. Make haste, for time presses."   ATHENS.-A VISIT TO ARISTOTLE.   75 In a few minutes the cook made his appear- ance at the door of Euphorus's chamber. He was a portly fellow, of about forty years of age, attired from head to foot in a suit of the purest white linen, which gave additional color to his rubicund complexion. "Know," said Euphorus, smiling at the some- what puzzled expression of the chef, " that the King of Macedonia hath sent to thy master a present of some exquisite fish, which are caught only in the Lake of Pella. They will shortly arrive with my baggage. They are contained in five large earthen jars of water, in the finest condition. Wishing to contrive an agreeable surprise for thy master, I would have thee cook a dozen of them according to this receipt, and serve them at table before he knows aught of the matter." "He will order a sturgeon, I am sure," replied the cook, "for such is his invariable custom when strangers dine with him; but I can omit the purchase, and charge it in my account." 1"Canst thou read?" asked Euphorus, show- ing him a receipt which he had taken the pre- caution to obtain from his mother. The chef assumed an air of insulted dignity     76        APELLES. as he replied, "My noble master errs egregiously if he imagines that I am one of those who give ' a handful' of this ingredient, ' a bit' of another, and a pinch' of a third, in the composition of my dishes. The scales of the mint are not more delicately balanced than those by means of which I proportion the ingredients of every dish." Casting his eye over the written directions, he expressed his approbation, but ended by saying, "If my noble master would not think me too presuming, I would venture to suggest that this almost perfect receipt would be improved by a little lemon juice and the merest suspicion of garlic. With your permission I am willing to take the responsibility of making the experi- ment, and will abide by your verdict." "By all means," said Euphorus, gaily; "I foresee a brilliant success, and here tender to thee thy reward in advance. One word of caution I must add," he continued, slipping a bright golden daric into his hand. "Neglect not the exact time laid down for their simmer- ing." "They shall be done to a bubble," said the cook, with an air of confidence. "I shall duly   ATHENS.--A VISIT TO ARISTOTLE. " prepare the palate of the guests by previously serving to each three oysters,--the number of the Graces. They are from Abydos, lively as mountain kids, and cool as the snows of Olym- pus." Having unburthened himself of a matter which had weighed upon his mind,--one, in fact, which had tasked his ingenuity sorely dur- ing the whole journey, Euphorus rejoined his master, whom he found again conversing with their host. "Let us now saunter leisurely along the prin- cipal streets," said Aristotle, " pausing occasion- ally to contemplate such objects of interest as may present themselves. To-day I shall omit my public lecture at the Lyceum, and shall find an agreeable recreation in. pointing out to our young friend the leading features of attraction in Athens." With such a cicerone, through such a city, on one of the balmiest days of spring, is it to be wondered at that Euphorus accompanied his master during a walk of three hours, totally unconscious of the passage, of time, until Aristotle, halting before a beautifully propor- tioned building, remarked that it now wanted     78        APELLES. two hours only of dinner-time. "This is the celebrated CLUB OF THE SIXTY," said he, "the resort of all the most distinguished wits and scholars of the day. Let us enter and repose awhile."   THE CLUB OF THE SIXTY.     "The most fruitful and natural exercise of the mind, in my opinion, is conversation; I find the use of it more sweet than any other action of life, and for that reason it is that, if I were now compelled to choose, I should sooner, I think, consent to lose my sight than my hearing and speech. The Athenians, and also the Romans, kept this exercise in great honor in their Academies; the Italians retain some footsteps of it to this day, to their great ad- vantage, as is manifest by a comparison of their understand- ings with ours. The study of books is a languishing and feeble motion that heats not, whereas conversation teaches and exercises at once. MONTAIGNE, L. III. L  4.   CHAPTER   VII. THE modern traveller finds at Athens, in the north-eastern section of the city, called Neapolis, a number of cafes; which are the favorite resort of all gay and fashionable loungers. Singularly enough, they happen to be precisely on the spot formerly occupied by the "Club of the Sixty," just entered by Aristotle and his two friends. In a large and airy room, they found a merry group attentively listening to a conver- sation between two members, on the compara- tive merits of old Aristophanes and Amphis, a contemporary writer of middle comedy. ' I confess myself to be somewhat prejudiced in favor of the old school," said the elder speaker, " but do not think I am blind to the merits of your favorite Amphis. He has, I grant you, a polished and brilliant style, but he certainly cannot lay claim to great orig- 6     82          APELLES. inality. Although his plots are ingenious, his subjects are all borrowed from Aristophanes. His ' Women's Rule,' for instance, is only a hash of that spicy dish, Aristophanes's ' Eccle- siazousee. " "Ay," rejoined his opponent, "but observe the difference of the seasoning; Aristophanes's play is not wanting   in Attic  salt, but what offends my taste is, that it is strewn about in large, coarse lumps, which makes his wit sometimes offensive.   In all of Amphis's pro- ductions, his salt is delicately powdered and so equally distributed, that a delicious flavor of piquant wit pervades the whole.    I should rank Aristophanes as the comedian of the mob, and Amphis the favorite of the scholar and refined critic. You shall see the Athe- nians weeping, like children in the morning, over that superb passage of Euripides, where Admetus, addressing the dying Alcestis, says, 'but wait my coming there, When I shall die, and have a home prepared, That we may dwell together in that world. For I will bid them lay my breathless corse In the same cedar, side by side with thee. For I will not be parted, e'en in death, From thee, who hast been faithful unto me.'   THE CLUB OF THE SIXTY.       83 And yet in the afternoon their sides will shake with laughter at Aristophanes's infa- mous parody of the last two lines, when the gourmand, holding the Copaic eel by the tail, says, 'Boys, look your fill at that most noble eel, Brought hither after six whole years of longing. Speak to her, children; I will fetch the coals For this fair stranger's sake; come, bring her on, For I will not be parted, e'en in death, From thee, dressed out in sav'ry leaves of beet.' To me it seems that this, instead of wit, amounts to little less than blasphemy. There are some things too sacred and revered to be polluted by coarse caricature. After he had written his play of 'The Knights,' no actor would venture to take the part of Cleon, so full of gross personalities, and he was obliged to perform it himself." "In which," rejoined   the other, "he  gave proof of the possession of courage as well as wit.  Remember that ' Cleon' was the     real name of an ignorant, low-born, cruel, and rapacious demagogue, whose pernicious influ- ence the  poet determined   to destroy.  The gross personalities of which you complain, only represented his character in its true     84           APELLES. light.  The  actors  who  declined  taking  the part, did so from a fear of Cleon's resentment; but Aristophanes was not to be deterred by such considerations. "In reply to your objections to his wit, that it is sometimes   coarse, allow  me  to remark, that it was suited to the times; that his works are full of beauty, is proved by their popu- larity and currency for a whole century. Shall I give you an illustration of my estimate of these two poets? -   Here is a  coin fresh from the  Macedonian   mint.  It has  the  modern style and exquisite finish, which you claim     for the works of Amphis; but give me, I say, this old Athenian coin, which, dating from     beyond the time of Pericles, and made of the purest silver from  the mines  of Laureiurn, although inferior in execution, and somewhat soiled and battered, still passes current in Asia and In- dia.*  Take  my  word  for it, the  plays  of - The coins of Alexander were very superior in point of artistic execution to those of the Athenians. This may seem strange, when we consider that the arts of sculpture, gem and medal cut- ting, were carried to the highest state of perfection at Athens.

"You will never agree, my friends," said another member; (" suspend your hostility, for here comes Timanthes, who has evidently something good on his mind. What is it, to- day, Tirmanthes, which has dressed your fea- tures with such sunny smiles?" "Such  a cunning  artifice of Dolon  the Cretan, which I have just had from   his own lips.  He is the most arrant knave  in all Athens, and has no   more conscience than a highway robber. A few days since he palmed off upon Lyciseus, the son of our Archon, a miserable copy of Parrhasius's Venus, under pretence that it was a duplicate by that great lmaster. The lad who painted it, learning the enormous price for which Dolon had sold it, (no less than ten mnai,) attributed it to the excellence of his work, rather than the igno- rance of the purchaser, and boasted that the beautiful coins of France and England are at a discount. Aware of this fact, the Athenians wisely kept up the old and somewhat rude style of the primitive money; just as merchants frequently carry on business under an old firm, and carefully preserve the old sign long after its letters are illegible.     86        APELLES. picture came from his pencil. So the thing leaked out and came to the ears of Lyciscus. who vowed revenge. As he was one morning lounging with two friends on the portico of the baths, an itinerant vender of knickknacks displayed before them a number of tempting gewgaws.  Among them  was a ruby ring, beautifully set in gold, which attracted his attention. "' What is the price of this ring?' asked he. "' Ten drachmas,' replied the peddler. 'It is but a trifle over the intrinsic value of the gold, and the artificial gem is so perfect an imitation that none but a professed lapidary would doubt its genuineness.' "' So this is a false ruby? have you any more?' "'It is the only one I brought with me from Ephesus. I could have sold it fifty times for a real one, but no one seems to appreciate its beauty, when I honestly inform them of its actual worth.' "Thou art an honest fellow,' said Lyciscus. 'The bauble is not dear, and I will be its purchaser.'   THE CLUB OF THE SIXTY.    87 "As soon as the salesman had departed, Lyciscus informed his friends that he intended to pay Dolon in his own coin.  I will sell him this ring for fifteen mnai, and get back what I paid him for that vile copy which he sold me.' A favorable opportunity soon pre- sented itself; for Dolon, coming out from the bath, met them in the portico. A desultory conversation took place, during which Dolon observed that Lyciscus, by the gestures of his hand, was studiously endeavoring to attract his attention to the ring daintily set upon his little finger. "'That is a very handsome ring of yours,' said he; 'a late acquisition?' "Yes, I was tempted into a piece of extrav- agance. I had it of one of Alexander's cap- tains, who was in want of money, and sold it to me for fifteen rmnai. It is worth much more, but I should rather invest the sum in some choice work of art. You might gain a very pretty profit from it; you shall have it at the same price I paid for it.' "'Is the ruby genuine?' asked Dolon, ex- amining it carefully. "I have not the slightest doubt of it,' re-     88        APELLES. plied Lyciscus, unblushingly. 'I judge so only from the source whence it came; but you are a judge of such things, and must decide for yourself.' "'It seems not dear,' said Dolon; ' and if it will oblige you, I will take it off your hands. Here is the money.' He placed the ring wiih evident satisfaction on his finger, and left the three youths, who were dying with the sup- pression of their laughter. "Dolon instantly repaired to an old lapidary, with whom  he had frequent dealings, and asked him the value of the ring. "' The setting is very handsome and of pure gold,' said the experienced dealer; 'but the gem is false, and not worth a drachma.' "( So I presumed,' said Dolon, composedly. 'What would a genuine ruby of that size cost me? "' Here is one of exactly the same size, but observe the difference of its sparkling light!' On weighing it carefully, he said it was worth twenty mnai. "'I will take it; have it set in this ring as soon as you can, and send it to my shop.' "The next day Lyciscus and his friends   THE CLUB OF THE SIXTY.   89 passed by the shop of Dolon, giggling and laughing without measure. "Come in, my friends,' said Dolon; 'whence this merriment. Has your father, O Lyciscus, gone off in a fit of apoplexy, leaving you his sole heir?' "O0 Dolon! Dolon! what an egregious dupe thou art; I sold thee a ring yesterday for fifteen mnai, for which I paid only ten drachmas! ho, ho, ho!' "' You must have bought it of a thief then,' said Dolon, with a piqued air. 'I am a judge of precious stones, and am very well satisfied with my bargain.' " 1 tell thee, Dolon, I bought it of an Epliesian, who told me the gem was a mere mockery, a false sham; ho, ho!' "' And I tell you, young master, that I am not so easily deceived, and that any jeweller in Athens will pronounce the gem genuine and worth more money.' "' I will leave it to Demetrius, the Ephesian, and our old Axippus. Furthermore, I will wager the sum of thirty mnai that they will both tell thee that thou art a silly dupe.'     90        APELLES. "'Agreed,' said Dolon. 'Your friends shall be witnesses. There is nothing to prevent our settling the matter at once.' So off they posted to the jewellers' quarter in the Agora, Lyciscus and his friends taunting and jeering Dolon all the way. "On entering the shop of the Ephesian, Dolon requested him to examine the ring care- fully, and to say what stone it contained, and what might be its value. "The jeweller examined it very carefully and attentively. "' It is a very, very fine ruby and is worth, as near as I can judge without weighing it, at least twenty mnai.' "( Thou art an ass!' shouted Lyciscus, in a violent passion. 'I bought it of a pedlar for ten drachmas.' "' If you can obtain any more at the same price,' said the incredulous jeweller, ' I should be glad to pay you ten times that sum for every one you will bring me.' "' Axippus will tell thee a different tale, O Dolon, and then we must leave the two to choose a third party to the reference.'   THE CLUB OF THE SIXTY.    91 " Axippus will confirm Demetrius's opinion, and you will have enriched me by the sum of twice the cost of this ring.' "The son of the Archon could not restrain himself, when Axippus pronounced the ruby not only genuine, but a very valuable one. He tore his hair, and swore that he was a swindling accomplice of Dolon, whom  he would expose to all Athens.. "Axippus, who is a man of well tried hon- esty, soon cut short his ravings and abuse by ordering him to leave the shop, 'other- wise,' said he, 'I will instantly break your head, were you the son of twenty Archons.' "The youth was obliged to pay the sum he had wagered, and in return received from Dolon a wholesome piece of advice. "' When you would wage a war of wit another time, seek for your adversary some one who is not so wide awake as Dolon of Crete!"' The whole company seemed infinitely di- verted by this story, which was related with much comic gesticulation and with the air of an accomplished and privileged story-teller. "You were born for an actor," said the     92        APELLES. old man, who had taken up the cudgels in favor of Aristophanes. "The time you have devoted to the study of the laws has been sadly thrown away." Aristotle now informed his guests that the hour of dinner was at hand. "My cook," said he, " always complains that I do him injustice when I am not punctual. A dinner, he says, is like a peach, which has but one moment of perfection, after which it begins to deteriorate.

THE distinguished orator, ZEschines, was in- vited by Aristotle to join him and his friends at dinner. He was the head of a large and powerful party who were opposed to the dem- ocratic views of Demosthenes, to whom he was known to be an open and formidable rival. "My sincere admiration for the character and talents of your King," said he to Apelles, when reclining opposite to him at dinner, " have sub- jected me to much calumny and abuse from my opponents. For two or three years, ever since my return from my embassy to the court of Philip, I have been firmly persuaded that the only safety for Greece lies in a confederation of her States, under the military command of the King of Macedonia. I have expressed my- self to that effect, and Demosthenes charges me with having received a bribe, and says openly that I am now in the pay of Alexander." "Is he possessed of such wondrous eloquence     96        APELLES. as is attributed to him by fame?" asked Apelles. "There is no man alive," replied AEschines, "who has such a masterly control of his audi- ence. They hang with breathless attention upon his persuasive words, until it seems to them that they are listening to the voice of an oracle. After he has convinced his hearers, he never fails to inflame their passions by a fervid burst of eloquence, which enables him to excite the whole people, as one man, to the adop- tion of any measure he recommends. As an orator, he stands unrivalled; as a statesman, I am opposed to him, and hence his enmity to me and my party. For the distinction and power of his present position he would sacrifice the welfare of his country. He has no regard for truth, and has shamefully calumniated me, rep- resenting me as a base-born hireling, and ac- cusing me of acts of the greatest meanness and criminality. All this I can pardon to him, and listen in admiration to the wonderful art he dis- plays in his falsehood; but when I hear him denounce Alexander and his father Philip as usurpers and robbers, seeking to crush the lib- erties of Greece, my admiration ceases, and lie   DINNER AT ARISTOTLE'S.   97 seems to me worse than a demagogue!--an accomplished and wily Thersites! What can protect us from the incursions of the rapacious barbarians of Asia and the North, except an honorable alliance with Macedonia, which stands like a rampart between us?  Both Philip and Alexander have always shown a high regard for the civilizing arts. Whatever countries they have subdued have been im- proved. They have introduced the arts and institutions of Greece wherever their arms have prevailed. Instead of enslaving the vanquished, they have conferred upon them liberty and the due enforcement of law and justice." Aristotle listened so attentively to this inter- esting account of Demosthenes, from the lips of a rival by no means contemptible, that he did not observe that a dish of his favorite fish lay smoking before him. Starting with an ex- pression of doubt, he tasted a morsel, saying, "Is this a miracle? What say you, 2Eschines, to the flavor of this fish?" "This surely is no fish," said the orator, who was no bad authority in matters of gastronomy. "It cannot be more nor less than ambrosia, the food of the immortal gods!" 7     98        APELLES. "Wash it down with a little of the nectar which Ganymede offers to you, and learn that this is the fish called Chromis, from the Lake of Pella. How my cook can have obtained it in such perfection I cannot imagine, unless Alex- ander has condescended to take an infinity of pains to send it to me." "I must inform you," said Apelles, " that it is the gift of my young friend here, since I see he is too modest to claim your thanks. During the whole of our journey I have seen him watch the vessels which brought them with an affec- tion and assiduity equalled only by that of a hen during the process of incubation." When Aristotle warmly expressed his grate- ful thanks for so acceptable a present, Eu- phorus replied, "Nay, your thanks are due only to the king, who devised the scheme of giving you a surprise. I am only the humble instrument by which he has shown his regard for you." "And right adroitly have you executed your commission," said Apelles, " for you have taken me by surprise as much as you have our host." "To the king then, through you," said Aris-   DINNER AT ARISTOTLE'S.         99 totle,  I repeat my thanks.    I used to think that it was perhaps the appetite of a younger man, which gave    such a relish  to this fish at Pella, but I never ate one with greater pleas- ure than now." "I am  well repaid for my pleasant trouble," said Euphorus, "for your cook      has made   a decided  improvement   upon  the  Macedonian receipt, which will enable   me  to give to the king a sample of what he can do."       In reply to sundry inquiries from his master and his host, how on the first day of his residence in Athens, the greater part of which had been spent abroad, he had contrived to serve at ta- ble an unexpected dish, dressed in the true Mac- edonian style with a decided improvement, he recounted what is already known to the reader.' "I will not ask,"    said Aristotle, "if Crete boasts the honor of being your birthplace, and * Dr. Johnson was not the first philosopher who doubted whether the good things of the earth were created for fools alone. Fish was held in high esteem by the ancient Greeks. Their love of it, especially some of the choicer varieties, amounted to a passion  During an important debate in the Athenian senate, according to a comnic writer, the voice of a crier in the streets, announcing the ar- rival of a quantity of favorite fish, caused the assembly to break up " in most admired disorder," the senators scrambling over the seats, and hurrying " en masse" in a chase for at fair share of the $polia opima.     100       APELLES. whether you are a disciple of Dolon, for your genius is employed in benevolent and agree- able devices, instead of the rascally tricks we listened to this morning." He then gave to -2schines a condensed account of Dolon's last chef-d'weuvre. "It is not the only trick he has played upon the members of that respectable family," said JEschines. "The grave and somewhat severe character of the father prevents his hearing of the misfortunes which the dissolute life and associates of his sons occasionally bring upon them. They are very careful not to complain to the Archon, otherwise Dolon would hardly dare to take such liberties. "The Archon's second son, Eubulus, is of so stupid and earthy a nature, that he is en- tirely excluded from the society of his equals. With all his money he has never been able to gain any admittance or share in the sports of the young Eupatridae or the aristocracy. His tastes are low, and he was bitterly dis- appointed in being excluded from a club of dissolute young men, who spend all their time in training cocks and quails to fight. It is a fashion lately introduced here, imported, as I   DINNER AT ARISTOTLE'S.   101 learn, from India. It seems to be very fasci- nating," continued he, turning to Euphorus, X"for, as soon as one acquires the taste, he be- comes utterly negligent of appearances; and you may see crowds of noble youths who have abandoned all pride, with a fowl in one hand and a pair of quails under their arms, sallying forth, looking like the marauders of a hen- coop, and frequently strolling many miles into the country in search of a combatant. "Eubulus expressed his regrets at being de- nied the refined pleasures of a sport so con- genial to his tastes, in a complaint to Dolon, who told him nothing was easier than for him to become one of the first cockfighters of Athens. 'I can purchase for you a cock of invincible prowess; you must challenge the club, and when they see the performance of your bird, they will elect you unanimously. It will cost you some money, for the fowls used in this sport are of a superior breed, im- ported from India, and require great care and expense in raising and training. A firstrate fighting-cock readily commands the price of a hundred drachmas, but if he is once victorious he will often bring twice that sum.'     102       APELLES. "'Purchase for me the best you can,' said Eubulus, handing him the money, and I will give thee one half of his first winnings.' "Dolon lost no time in purchasing an enor- mous fat capon, which he exhibited to Eu- bulus as the paragon of fighting-cocks of the finest breed. He has a sneaking and cowed air,' said Eubulus. "' Wait until you see him roused by the presence of an adversary,' replied Dolon. 'There is not a cock in all Athens that can stand before the weight he carries. Take him to the club at once; and before showing your bird, offer to wager no less than a quarter of a talent.' "Eubulus placed the capon within a linen bag, which Dolon had provided for him; and going at once to the house where he had learned the cockfighters had a session, he sent up his challenge, offering to fight his cock against any champion in their possession. The sum he proposed as a wager was three hun- dred drachmas. "The challenge was eagerly accepted, and the keenest sportsman of the crowd threw into   DINNER AT ARISTOTLE'S.   103 the ring a small and exquisitely trimmed black game-cock, whose head, shorn of comb and gills, looked like that of a snake. His eyes shone like diamonds as he lustily crowed de- fiance. "Pshaw!' said Eubulus, triumphantly, ' I can beat that little fellow easily. Here is one tw\ice his size.' He opened the mouth of his bag and threw down his capon, the size of whose comb and gills rivalled those of a turkey- cock. Before a word was spoken the game- cock gave one spring, and with his spurs ripped open the crop of his adversary, empty- ing upon the floor a heap of corn of the size of my fist. "All the members of the fraternity rose with an exclamation of vociferous indignation. They thought, evidently, that the son of the Archon had intentionally insulted them; and without waiting to receive the money he proffered, they hustled him out of the house into the street bareheaded." Neither Aristotle nor Apelles could refrain from joining in a chorus of laughter with Eu- phorus, on the conclusion of this story. We omit a detailed description of the dinner     104        APELLES. as uninteresting to all but the antiquary; we pass by, also, the scholion, or song, invariably sung at the table, which, on this occasion, was of Aristotle's own composition, "A Song to Health," with which scholars are familiar, and can enjoy in the original Greek. The banquet was protracted to a late hour of the night, when the host rose, and his guests retired to rest.   I I I                       I THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.

ARISTOPHAN ES.   CHAPTER IX. THE next morning was devoted by our trav- ellers to visiting the wonders of the Acropolis. They ascended a flight of stone steps of easy. grade, some seventy feet in breadth. Through the centre of these steps ran a gently inclined plane for the accommodation of carriages. On the upper landing, the Propylea, or entrance gateway, exhibited a frowning front of military architecture. Passing through its ample and lofty portal, they ascended to a broad area from which the Parthenon rose in stately and majes- tic grandeur. With breathless awe Euphorus mounted the steps leading to the colonnade surrounding the temple. The enormous size and height of the columns made him feel the pigmy insignificance of the few mortals who were gathered under the roof of the sacred goddess. His own individ- uality seemed to be absorbed by an invisible and immortal presence pervading and filling the     108       APELLES. temple. A powerful perfume of incense, burn- ing on the altar of Minerva, intoxicated his senses and excited his imagination. For a long time he could express his admiration only in whispering tones of reverence and awe. As his mind gradually expanded and recov- ered from the crushing effect of his first emo- tions, his attention was attracted by the beauty, symmetry, and musical harmony of the building. The presence of the deity was soon forgotten in his admiration of the genius of the great artists whose brains had conceived and whose hands had executed the plan of an abode worthy the protectress of Athens. The works of Phidias and his scholars filled him with surprise and wonder. On the tympa- num of the pediments he beheld a conclave of gods and demi-gods sculptured in colossal maj- esty. The metopes of the entablature were dec- orated with groups of Centaurs and Lapitha in alto rilievo. A continuous procession of priests, warriors, matrons, and virgins formed the frieze of the Nqos. Here he beheld the pomp and so- lemnity of the sacrificial ceremony, the stately march of warriors, and the joyous rites of the nuptial festival. The vigor, strength, and dig-   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   109 nity of the male form was contrasted with the delicate grace of female loveliness; age acquired dignity by the side of youth, and the mature matrons displayed the full-blown perfections promised by the budding beauties of the young virgins. Ictinus the architect, and Phidias the sculptor, under whose joint supervision the edifice had been raised, were now the sole objects of the young Macedonian's unqualified admiration. "I must come hither again and again," said Euphorus, as they left the temple. "A whole year's study would daily discover to me new beauties. No wonder that the Athenians boast that Minerva has her abode in Athens only!" The double temple of Minerva Polias and Erectheus next claimed their attention. Paus- ing before a portico supported by Caryatides, or colossal statues of Persian matrons, Apelles re- marked,- "How beautifully the rich, oriental style of this architecture contrasts with the Doric sever- ity of the Parthenon! What a Sphinx-like ex- pression pervades the exquisitely symmetrical features of these Persian captives! The majes- tic forms and graceful attitudes of these figures,     "O       APELLES. as well as the style of the rich, flowing drapery, would indicate that this portico is the wolrk of the school of Phidias. The date of the temple itself seems more doubtful. The two buildings are not only of different orders, but are joined together in an incongruous manner, which I cannot conceive to have been regulated by any knowledge of the true principles of art. Ob- serve the different heights of the two temples, the pediment of one mutilated by the walls of the other. They have nothing in common, and seem to have been brought together by some violent and accidental collision. I cannot be- lieve that Ictinus could have had any hand in a work so utterly deficient in unity." 'Its date is very uncertain," said Aristotle. "There is a tradition that it was partially de- stroyed by Xerxes, and there is no record ex- plaining how far it was restored by Pericles." After spending two or three hours in examin- ing and admiring these temples and the works of art contained in them, Aristotle repaired to his Lyceum. Apelles proposed to devote the rest of the day to selecting such works of art as might be found worthy of acquisition for the royal galleries at Pella. Euphorus, therefore,   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   1" bent his steps towards the Agora, or business part of the city. His curiosity had been excited by hearing it extolled as surpassing all the ago- ras of Greece in size, wealth, and rich display of goods. He found it an extensive oval-like area, sur- rounded by rows of shops, temples, porticos, and other public buildings of the richest style of ar- chitecture. The open space inclosed was inter- sected by numerous walks, lined on either side by rows of plane-trees. They had been planted at the termination of the Persian war, and had now acquired a stately growth, affording a most agreeable shade. Near the centre, the altars of Pity and the twelve gods stood in a circle, and at one end the statues of Harmodius and Aris- togiton, two patriots whose memory was cher- ished with hardly inferior reverence. But the most attractive feature of the scene was a great number of booths and tents, which were ranged in rows under the shade of the wide-spreading planes. The orderly bustle, life, and activity of the scene reminded Euphorus of an ant-hill, where all are intent on their own business without jostling or incommoding their neighbors. The gay, vivid, and varied colors of     "2       APELLES. tlhe costumes, continually shifting as the citizens moved about, passing and repassing each other, gave to the Agora the air of an immense field of flowers, gently agitated by the summer wind. Here and there dense crowds, swarming around some peculiarly attractive booth, showed like a cluster of bees collected upon a richly perfumed flower. From this multitude of thousands there rose, like an exhalation, a hum of voices and sounds, among which were heard the musical cries of the venders of small wares, the mellow tones of the cithara and liquid flageolet, occasionally drowned by the discordant bray of a long line of asses, which, led by a sturdy Bceotian peas- ant, bore to the market well-laden panniers of fruit and vegetables. For a long time the young Macedonian was too much occupied by the general effect of the scene to pay attention to any individual fea- tures. As he strolled leisurely along, the spicy odors which occasionally greeted his nostrils told him that he was passing by the stall of a druggist or the stand of a perfumer. A group of flower-girls, seated by the side of wicker bas- kets filled with nosegays, were singing and /   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   113 weaving garlands and chaplets of roses, to be worn at feast or ceremonial. A clean, earthy smell of country produce next attracted his eye to the booth of the vegetable dealer. Here the treasures of the field and the garden were exhib- ited in tempting array. Bright bunches of rad- ishes reposed on beds of tender green lettuce; on the shelves above and around, broccoli, cauli- flowers, artichokes, celery, and the silver onion lay sparkling with diamond drops of dew. At the fishmongers, he beheld large earthen tubs filled with limpid water, in which various fishes were swimming as gayly as if in their native crystal brooks. The scarlet hue of the lobster lost none of its vividness by contrast with the unsullied whiteness of the marble slab on which it was displayed. A middle-aged man in dainty apparel ap- proached a young slave who bore in one hand an enormous sturgeon, and a brace of fine pea- cocks as a pendant in the other. Saluting him familiarly, and slipping into his hand a small piece of silver, "At what hour does our well- born master dine to-day?" asked he. "At one hour before sunset," said the slave, pouching the coin in his mouth. 8     "4       APELLES. "Thanks, Ixias; I shall be punctual. Bid the cook to be a little more sparing of onions, in the sauce and stuffing, than is his wont." Euphorus concluded that he beheld a speci- men of the Fly, or professed parasite, who, liv- ing upon others, enjoyed scot-free all the luxu- ries of the Athenian market. He had heard of such a class, but could scarcely credit the tale. He was soon confirmed in his belief, however, by overhearing a conversation between this indi- vidual and another of the same kidney. "And thou, my friend, hast thou secured any choice tithit to-day? I have been very fortu- nate." "I cannot complain of my luck," said the other, "for early this morning I saw a goodly portion of wild boar carried off by a slave whom I had not seen before. On my asking whither he carried it, he refused to tell me, and was only persuaded by a double fee, -the mercenary ras- cal! However, before giving it, I made him promise to have the almond sauce flavored with the kernels of a few peach-stones, which is my latest invention. Accordingly, to-day I dine at the Archon's!" "I will exchange dinners with you, and pay   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   115 back the fee by which you bought yours," said the first of the speakers. "Nay," replied the other, laughingly; I am somewhat tired of sturgeon, and wish you a good appetite." After passing an hour or two in sauntering among the motley crowd, Euphorus made a cir- cuit of the shops and other buildings which formed the circumference of the Agora. 'Be- neath the porticos of the temples, and under the shade of the colonnades, whole bevies of fe- male flute-players, citharists, and dancing-girls were singing, and playing lively airs, as they waited to be hired to perform at some banquet or ceremonial. He was astonished at the num- ber of shops devoted to the same branch of commerce. Here were ranged five or six shops, all occupied by booksellers; next came as many devoted to the sale of spices, sauces, and pre- serves; then articles of bronze manufacture, such as vases, lamps, and candelabra. These were followed by the shops of the mercers, where embroidered veils, shawls of costly fabric, and rich tapestry drew a large crowd of admir- ing females. Lastly, coming to the jewellers' quarter, he entered one of the richest shops with     "6       APELLES. the intention of purchasing a present for his mother. He was soon puzzled how to choose from the jewelled treasures which were spread out before him, - golden chains, necklaces, arm- lets, anklets, sandal clasps, finger rings, ear-rings, golden grasshoppers, and jewelled agraffes and brooches. He finally selected a set of agraffes of pearl and gold, with which to adorn the sleeves of his mother's muslin tunic, on his re- turn home. He had just paid for them when, on leaving the shop, he met Eschines, nicely dressed, and wearing a small hat with that jaunty air which has been handed down to us by a passage in one of Demosthenes's orations.* The orator, saluting him with great cordiality, inquired what he had found to amuse him at the Agora. "I have just witnessed a phase of your Athe- nian society," said Euphorus, "which has filled me with surprise and astonishment. I have just heard two vagabond parasites comparing notes on the merits of the respective dinners at which they intended this very day to intrude them- selves, unbidden guests. One boasted that he intended to dine with a wealthy citizen who * Dem. de Fals. Leg. s 72.   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   117 had sturgeon for dinner; and the other, in a tone of triumph, announced that he expected a better dinner at the Archon's. Both had tam- pered with the domestics of these persons. Were I the Archon, or even a private citizen, I would take care that a sound cudgelling should teach them better manners." JEschines smiled at this proof of his young friend's rusticity as he replied,- "You must remember that these are men dis- tinguished for their wit, accomplishments, and convivial talents, who are at all times welcome guests at the tables of the rich and fashionable. The numerous invitations which they have to come freely sometimes prove embarrassing, and the free and easy style in which they spoke of their intentions to honor this or that man is only a specimen of the affected cant of that class of idlers, which is to be found in all large cities." A man with venerable locks of silver and a long, flowing beard here approached Euphorus and addressed him. "Welcome to Athens, O illustrious stranger! whom Macedonia has sent hither as a choice specimen of the flower of her youth! -thrice happy in thy destinies, but hap- pier still, didst thou but know the treasures Ee tnA     "8       APELLES. which the future has in store for thee. A high- born Athenian virgin, having an enormous for- tune, unguarded by the Argus eyes of either parent or guardian, has beheld thee, and loves thee. Thou canst marry her to-morrow, unless a most beautiful person and rare accomplish- ments prove an obstacle in thine eyes. Give me but a quarter of the sum which thou hast just squandered at yonder jeweller's, and I will make thee acquainted with her." "Base pander and cheat!" said Eschines, fiercely turning upon the old man; "has the money I gave thee to buy leeches with, yes- terday, for thy dying daughter, been spent so freely in wine that thou dost not recognize me? Begone! or I will summon an Agoranomos, who shall publicly scourge thee for a thief and lying impostor." The old fellow muttered something indis- tinctly about his having mistaken his man, and slunk away into the crowd. "It was no longer ago than yesterday even- ing," said AEschines, " that I was duped by the crafty devices of that infamous old rogue. He rushed out upon me from the corner of a build- ing. 'Save me! save me, stranger!' cried he.   THE ACROPOLIS AND AGORA.   119 My little daughter lies at the point of death. She has a brain-fever, and the physician says she can be saved only by the application of six- teen Sicilian leeches. The surgeon charges the enormous sum of a drachma apiece, and refuses to give me credit. Give me the money, save my daughter's life, and me from distraction!' Tears ran down his wrinkled cheeks, he wrung his hands, and his whole frame trembled with emotion. I was sensibly touched by his well- feigned grief, and immediately gave him the money, which he snatched eagerly from my hand, invoking upon me the blessings of all the gods. The cool and cheerful tone of his impu- dence to-day convinces me that he is one of those i who live by imposing upon the benevolent by fictitious tales of distress." "I cannot imagine," said Euphorus, by no ;  means flattered at being selected as an easy ,  victim, "how he knew me for a Macedo- nian." "He probably saw you pay the jeweller with Macedonian coin. I observed him watching you, and noticed the fact myself. He did not recognize me; and, beginning to suspect his real character, I took no notice of him, for I 'i     120        APELLES. fancied I saw in his eye the expression with which a pike watches his prey." After a few minutes' further conversation, AEschines remarked, "My way lies in this di- rection; yours, I presume, to the house of Aristotle; so here I must leave your pleasant company, and wish you a very good appetite."

SAPPHO.   CHAPTER X. As Apelles and Aristotle were one day walking together under the shade of the beau- tiful plane-trees, on the banks of the Ilissus, the latter observed, that the Dionysiac festivals were nearly at a close. "To-day," said he, "commences the representation of the three CEdipean tragedies of Sophocles. On the third day will be given the Antigone, for which the tribe iEgeYs, with the consent of the Archon, Evaenetus, has voluntarily come forward and  offered to make brilliant provision. You are aware that Sophocles was born at Colonos,- sparkling. Colonos,' as he calls it; and that Colonos, which you see yonder about ten stadia distant, is one of the demes of the tribe JEgeis, which derives its name from the ancient king AEgeus. The inhabitants of that pretty suburb are proud of the poetical fame of their Demesman, and they are all astir with the     124       APELLES. prospect of seeing one of his famous tragedies again brought upon the stage. It is the corn- mon custom of the Athenians, to have the new tragedies first produced at the greater Diony- siac festival; but the works of the three great masters may be repeated, on all suitable oc- casions, by a special law made in their favor. The pieces offered this month, at the Diony- siac, were thought very ordinary; and the Ar- chon was anxious that the year of his adminis- tration should have a better record than could be made of them. He has, therefore, not only readily accepted the offer of the tribe IErgeis, but has taken unusual pains that the represen- tation should not disappoint the public expec- tation. He has induced Aristodemus to take the part of Protagonistes." ' Aristodemus?" said Apelles. "Do you mean Aristodemus, who once came on an em- bassy from Athens to Macedonia? I remember hearing it said that he was an Athenian player." "The same," said Aristotle. "The profes- sion of player here in Athens is no obstacle to political advancement; nay, it is a good preparation for public speaking before the as- sembly; and public speaking is, you know, in   A SUBURBAN EXCURSION.    125 a city like this, the surest way to political in- fluence. Aristodemus has not appeared upon the stage for some years; but old associations, and the longing for popular applause, which never wholly dies in the breast of him who has once tasted its sweets, have overcome the hesi- tation with which he first listened to the pro- posal, and he has undertaken to play the An- tigone. He has some personal qualifications for the part, not usually possessed by men of his age and experience. He is still slender of person, and remarkably youthful in appearance, with a voice whose soft and rich tones have lost nothing of their delicacy. I propose," con- tinued the philosopher, " as your time is so much occupied, that we omit the first two representations, and witness the Antigone on the third; and that we take to-morrow for a stroll to the hill of Colonos, and to the groves of the Academy, which lie near it on the left." "Most willingly," answered the artist. "To visit spots so sacred to poetry, art, learning, and religion, with Aristotle for my guide, will be the most exquisite of all the exquisite gratifications I shall have experienced during this, my visit to Athens."     126       APELLES. Having thus agreed upon the amusements of the next two days, the friends parted,- Aristotle taking his way to a line of tanks near the Ilissus, in which he had placed a large number of the fishes brought, or sent to him, from the various rivers of Greece, for the purpose of watching their habits, an employ- ment in which he took the greatest delight. Apelles followed the windings of the river farther up the plain, and passing the bridge, found himself in the midst of a landscape of singular beauty. Noticing a beautiful bit of turf under the spreading branches of a lofty agnus castus, which diffused a pleasant odor far around, he approached the spot, and had no desire to resist the temptation of reclining on the grassy couch. He fell soon into an agree- able revery, as he traced the course of the river, and watched the splendid panorama of the surrounding hills. At the distance of some eight or ten stadia rose the Acropolis, in the centre of the city, with temples and statues of Phidian workmanship. Just above him the conical peak of Lycabettus, surmounted by a small temple, shone in the translucent air. The plain was bounded on the east by Mount Pen-   A SUBURBAN EXCURSION.    127 telicus, whose marble quarries had furnished the materials for the temples and statues of the gods, and were now gleaming and flashing above the belt of trees that zoned the mountain, in the unclouded rays of the westward-descending sun. Farther south stretched the gigantic form of Hymettus, where innumerable swarms of bees were murmuring, as they plied their daily task amidst the fragrant thyme which covered the broad slopes of the mountain. At first, Apelles was struck with admiration at the picturesque beauty of the scene, and resolved to make a sketch, to be filled up at some future time. But the pleasant breeze, temper- ing the warmth of the day, and playing so enchantingly with the flowers of the agnus castus over his head, diverted his attention from his. artistic design, and threw him into a mood for still and indolent musing. "I begin to understand," thought he to himself, "what the loungers of Athens mean by Apragmosyne; this is the very perfection of having nothing to do. Mere existence is a delight. I could resign myself to my present sensations forever, forgetting even the art which has hitherto been the delight of my life. Who can resist the     128       APELLES. soft influences that steal so deliciously over the senses, and wrap the soul in Elysi--"Before he could finish the word which seemed to die away upon his lips, his head drooped upon his turfy pillow, and Apelles slept. The river softly murmured over its pebbly bed; the breeze continued to play its sportive measures among the thick foliage of the groves along the banks; the sun slowly went down behind the Acropolis, lighting the columns of the Parthenon, and tipping with gold the helmet and spear of the bronze Athena of Phidias; behind the famous Island of Salamis; beyond the Saronic Gulf; behind the moun- tains of the Megaria and of Peloponnesus. And as the shadows fell upon the plains, the gauzy drapery of the mountains changed to violet, then to delicate purple; and the silver light of the rising moon streamed over hill and vale, temple, statue and shrine, as Apelles slept. Hour after hour passed away, and Apelles still slept. How long his slumbers would have lasted, had nothing occurred to wake him, we cannot say. But it so happened that a party of revellers, who had been carousing at the   ]':t A SUBURBAN EXCURSION.      129 house of a wealthy Athenian citizen, tempted by the beauty of the evening, deserted their cups earlier than usual, (they had no Socrates to charm the speeding hours of the night by his witty conversation,) and issuing into the streets, with chaplets on their heads, rushed in the direction of the river, through fields after- wards famous as the Gardens of Epicurus. Passing along the temple of Olympian Zeus, they followed the line of groves, laughing, shouting, and singing. Sometimes they paused in their jovial course to complete in chorus a song that one of them had commenced alone; and it so happened that one of these pauses took place but a short distance from the spot !:-  where Apelles still lay sleeping. The ode A which they happened to be chanting at this momlent, was a favorite song on the love of Selene for the sleeping Endymion.   It was some time before the revellers caught a view of the slumberer; and when they did, the soft light of the moon seemed to be ten- derly stealing over his singularly beautiful countenance, and to kiss his slightly parted lips, over which came at the same moment a smile. 9 I. j . ,I/o     130       APELLES. "By Zeus and all the gods," shouted one of the revellers, "here is Endymion himself, and yonder Artemis is kissing him while he sleeps." "See," said another, " what a charming spot he has chosen for his couch; how fragrantly the air breathes over his closed eyelids. By Apollo and the Muses, he has done well to leave the rugged cave of Latmos for the green bank of the Ilissus, and the enamored goddess has done well to follow him hither. Long life to the loves of Selene and Endymion!" All joining in this genial invocation, the shouts awakened the sleeper. Opening his eyes, he gazed with astonishment on the scene around him. The truth is, the words of the song had mingled with his dreams, and had shaped out of their incoherent forms a pleas- ing reproduction of the Latmian legend, of which he fancied himself the hero. The god- dess was just touching his lips, which were smiling with the anticipated bliss, when the untimely shouts of the Comos scattered the delightful visions to the air, and recalled his bewildered senses from the land of legends and poetic dreams.   A SUBURBAN EXCURSION.    131 "Apelles! Apelles!" exclaimed Lyciscus, the son of the Archon. "Apelles! Apelles!" re- echoed a dozen other voices, "the great paint- er, playing Endymion here in Athens. Come, master painter, give an account of yourself. How came you here?    Keeping an appoint- ment with Selene, eh?"  And Apelles found himself surrounded by a number of friends, whose acquaintance he had lately made at a fashionable symposium. "By all the nymphs, I can hardly tell my- self," he stammered in some confusion, fan- eying that, in some way inexplicable to him, the speaker had divined his dreams. "This afternoon I was talking with Aristotle, and after parting with him, as I now remember, I wandered listlessly to this spot. Here I sat down, intending to sketch the landscape, but a fit of your Athenian Apragmosyne came over me, and I fell asleep."  e "Nonsense," said one of the excited youths. "If you have been talking with that smoky gerontion of an old philosopher, no wonder you dropped asleep. I only wonder you are now awake." A general laugh rewarded this hit at the     132       APELLES. great Stagirite, and Apelles, rising from his recumbent position, turned in the direction of the city. 4   "The least we can do," said one of the band, "is to accompany Apelles home. So, forward to the phrontistery of the old philoso- pher." Apelles would gladly have rid himself of their presence; but seeing that they were bent on having the frolic out, submitted with the best grace he could to the noisy accompani- ment. As they approached the house of Aris- totle, they saw a light still burning in his study. A slave unfastened the front door. Aristotle, hearing the loud talk and laughter, came forward. His unexpected presence si- lenced the tumult' in a moment. Graciously welcoming his guest, and expressing some wonder at his long absence, and the unusually late hour of his return,-to say nothing of the uproarious retinue which had attended him, -he stood as if expecting a reply. In a moment, however, the broken thread of his speculations seemed to be reunited, and turn- ing on his heel, he reentered his study, and resumed the record of the observations he had   A SUBURBAN EXCURSION.         133 '^? been making that afternoon, on      the domestic habits and family affections of the Glanis.' "Thanks to the genius of philosophy," said the  artist, as the  slave  led the way with    a lighted taper to his sleeping apartment.     "My head  is still a  little confused, and   I could hardly have explained to Aristotle's satisfaction the  adventures of this   evening.   But I have had    a  rare dream."   With   these words   he composed   his head  upon  his pillow, and en- deavored to recall the bright vision which had been so rudely dispelled. * A fish of Greece, carefully described in Aristotle's History of Animals. Some of the details of the description were doubted by Cuvier; but the accuracy of Aristotle's observations has lately been completely vindicated in a paper published in the proceed- ings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hereafter it will be known to naturalists under the title of "Glanis Aris- totelis." -

A PROFOUND slumber soon closed the eyelids of the wearied artist, who fancied himself still reclining in the woods, with the radiant goddess H::i, of the silver bow by his side. All night long she seemed to be bending over him, fanning him with her long white wings, and speaking in tones of endearment, as with upturned counte- nance he gazed with rapture upon her majestic loveliness. "And why dost thou love me?" asked he, in a gentle whisper. "Because thou art as pure as fair. Thou hast never loved, and therefore I love thee. Love none but me, none but me!" "What is the meaning of this dream?" asked Apelles, on awaking in the morning. "Do the gods mean to intimate to me that I am to be wedded to my art alone, by sending the maiden queen of the skies to claim me for her own?     138        APELLES. Whence this sensation of overflowing happi- ness? This is not love, for I suffer none of the pangs and tortures which poets describe, but rather a benign and blissful exaltation which has taken full possession of my breast. Cal this be the blessed influence of this glorious southern climate upon a young and healthy frame? 'EvSe'era^, it is possible, as Aristotle frequently says, when he is in a puzzle." After a slight repast, the sage of the Iyceum and his guest sallied forth on their excursion just as the rising sun had shot his first rays above the ridges of Hymettus.  They were attended by a single slave, who drove before him a small donkey, laden with a pannier of bread, fruit, wine, and all the materials and uten- sils necessary for preparing a solid dinner. They quitted the city by the Acharnean Gate, on the Northern wall, leading from that point towards the Pass of Phyle, not far east of the hill of Colonos, which they proposed to visit first. They soon left the outskirts of the city be- hind them, and descended into a richly culti- vated valley, through which the Cephissus winds its placid way. On either side, they passed a succession of smiling villas, owned by   COLONOS.       139 citizens of the middle classes, who spent the whole year in tilling the soil, or by wealthy persons, who passed only a few months in the pleasures of the country, to which all classes of the Athenians were passionately attached. An hour's stroll, enlivened by conversation and an- ecdote, brought them nigh to Colonos. Xan- thias, the slave, halted under the shade of a tree on the banks of the Cephissus, and was busily engaged in unpacking his wares as the two friends ascended the hill. A dense forest, tenanted by birds alone, showed our two friends that they were in the immediate neighborhood of the precincts of the "Venerable Goddesses,"---that mysterious grove where dwelt the awful powers, daughters of Earth and Darkness,- the Eumenides, or Fu- ries. As they approached in silent reverence the hallowed spot, the voice of a nightingale was borne upon the charmed air, and dispelled the gloom which had begun to weigh upon their spirits. As they ascended the slope of the hill they came upon a terrace where stood the tem- ple of Neptune and a statue of Equestrian Co- lonos. Not far off were the altars of Athena, Demeter, Zeus, and Prometheus; and besides   "O       APELLES. the inclosure of the Eumenides, the sanctuaries of Pirithous, Theseus, CEdipus, and Adrastus. On the other side, behind a belt of Olive groves, rose the walls, the towers, and Acropolis of Athens, presenting a picture as magnificent as the eye of poet or painter ever gazed upon. Conducting Apelles to a cluster of trees on the southern side, Aristotle invited his friend to shelter himself from the increasing heat of the sun beneath their grateful shade. The genius of Sophocles, and the perfection of his three (Edipodean tragedies, were naturally suggested as the topic of conversation by a visit to his birthplace. "I am already familiar," said Apelles, " with the (Edipus Tyrannus, not only having read it with great admiration, but having seen it per- formed at Pella. Philip, who was a sagacious judge of poetry, always praised the kingly bearing of CEdipus, and expressed in the warm- est terms his admiration of the masterly man- agement of the plot." "True," replied Aristotle. "I have frequently heard him speak on the same subject; and to me, as a student of human nature, no less than the principles of the poetic art, it was a matter   COLONOS.       141 of unusual interest to hear the King of Mace- don pass his judgment upon the mimic mon- arch of the scene. "Even in poetry," he continued, "' I confess I experience a singular pleasure in finding a basis of reality. This has led me to notice an excel- lence in our great poets which I have never heard properly stated in any critical discussion. I mean their fidelity to outward nature. When they have fixed upon a spot where to lay a dra- matic incident, or to be mentioned in an epic narrative, they do not employ imaginary scenery. What they describe, they describe faithfully. Mountains, rivers, plains, and shores are truly presented, if such objects exist in the places where the transactions occur. CEdipus kills Laius where three roads meet; you must have seen the spot on the road between Delphi and Thebes. Antigone beholds the walls of Athens from the brow of this hill, as we now do. The signal light shines down from the Arachneean heights upon the roof of the Atride in Argos, and so on. Homer makes Neptune behold the shores of Troy from the heights of Samothrace, although the Island of Imbros intervenes. Ulys- ses is driven by the waves and the current out-     "2        APELLES. side of Cythera, as he attempts to double the promontory of Malea. The Scamander smokes at one of its sources, and at the other is cold as ice in summer. I might go on all day pointing out illustrations of fidelity to facts, as far as poetry admits the application of this principle. In every one of these cases, the investigator, vis- iting these places with book in hand, will find no difficulty in verifying what I assert. The poet seizes upon the great and characteristic features of nature, and stands by them with the fidelity of a soldier at his post." "In my art," said Apelles, " fidelity to nature is always attended with equally happy results. For instance, a landscape painted from nature, in the open air, has always a character of truth and reality, while those which are painted from memory or imagination alone seem thp un- substantial visions of an incoherent dream. This is one out of many instances in which the arts of painting and poetry illustrate each other." "These remarks were suggested to me just now," continued Aristotle, " by a passage in Sophocles, in the second CEdipodean tragedy. It occurs in the choral ode in praise of Colonos.   COLONOS.            143 At the age of ninety years, whilst he was com- posing this play, the    great poet was charged by one of his two sons with incompetency        to manage his estate, and was summoned to make a defence before the judges.      He read this very passage in court as a proof that his mind was still unimpaired, and     the  judges unanimously dismissed the case.     On  this spot the objects of sight and sound described by him       are around us, and   you  shall judge of his fidelity to    the nature he portrays." "Well did fate thy wanderings lead, Stranger, to this hill of fame, Birthplace of the generous steed, Graced by white Colonos' name.

"Exquisite, by all the   Graces!" exclaimed Apelles, enthusiastically.  "The description is equally brilliant and true, and the best com- mentary on its unrivalled   excellence is to  be read and heard itn the sights and sounds around us, -the  Attic  nightingale, whose   warbling hardly surpasses the poet's song; yonder golden crocus, and the gentle murmurings of the cool Cephissus, amidst the flowers and fresh herbage which mark his way through the plain; and oh, most poetical device! the animation given to the radiant scene by the introduction of the jovial train of Bacchus and the Queen of Love.  Had  I been  all the  Phratores,-- the whole court together,--gentle shade of Soph- ocles! thou shouldst have had every vote of mine for acquittal."   COLONOS.        145 "Spoken like an artist, O most admirable Apelles! And yet, perhaps, the son of Sopho- cles had some ground for his complaint. The poet had a grandson who inherited his name and his tastes; and the partiality of the old man for this irregular scion might reasonably cause anx- iety to his real heirs. Poetic genius is no proof of chrematistic talent,- perhaps the contrary. You, my Apelles, will never be as rich as Pa- sias, admirably as you paint." May all the gods forfend," said Apelles, laughing, "if you mean the withered and wrinkled skeleton who was pointed out to me in the Agora as the richest man in Greece." "And yet he is good in his way." "Good?G " "Yes. His credit is good to the shores of the Euxine Sea, at Tarentum and Massilia. Nay, it is said that his name is well known by the barbarous Tin-Islanders," a nation found on the outskirts of the earth by the Phoenician merchant-pirates." "I envy not his fame," said Apelles. ' How England was known to the ancient Greeks only as an island abounding in tin. Perhaps the slang use of the word!" tinl," for nnciiey, may be traced to this classical source! 10  "6       APELLES. much better to be known by the refined and cultivated Greeks, or even in Athens to be known as Plato, Sophocles, and Aristotle are, and -as Apelles hopes to be. Who can say that our names may not yet reach that distant land?" "'EvSeXevra," said the philosopher, musing. A long interval of silence occurred. The last words of Apelles caused the philosopher to review mentally his claims upon future ages for remembrance and gratitude. He had erected the study of Natural History into a science. He had perfected the art of Logic. He had laid down the laws of Dramatic and Epic Poetry on a basis which he felt was permanent, and had rescued Metaphysics from the dreamy and speculative bondage in which it had previ- ously been held. Excited and elevated by the previous con- versation, Apelles, whose soul was wrapped in his art, felt an exulting confidence that, wher- ever the art of painting should flourish, his name would stand first on the list of fame. With half-closed eyes, it seemed to him that the goddess who had visited his dreams on the previous night was still present, inspiring   -! ,iCOLONOS.             147 him with courage, and giving a promise of success. A delicious odor of something cooking at a short distance aroused the two friends from their abstraction. "It is well that Xanthias has a chrematistic talent," said Aristotle, " or we should have beet in danger of forgetting our dinner. The cook has prepared some dishes, which only require warming. The sa- vory smell which greets my nostrils informs me that dinner is ready, and most welcome it is." A few minutes' walk brought them to the banks of the Cephissus, where they had left Xanthias in the forenoon. "Xanthias," said Aristotle, " has shown a truly artistic eye for comfort in the selection of this spot;-here is a  turfy seat, shaded by this cluster of trees, cooled by the waters of the river, and fragrant with wild flowers. But, by Hercules, what an array of provender! Did you expect to feast an army?  You   must have spent an hour or two  in making out the FpazaT'8oV of this banquet." Xanthias replied with great gravity; "When a man in the city plans a dinner to be eaten in the country, he is very apt not to make   "8       APELLES. allowance for the increased appetite which country air and exercise will bring him. I committed this mistake on our last excursion, and the two strangers, who at your table in Ath- ens, scarcely ate at all, were no sooner seated in the open air in the country than they de- voured all before them like ravenous wolves. That day poor Xanthias found not a crumb left for his dinner! Better is too much than too little, for the remnants are always sure to come into play." c Most logically and sententiously stated," said the philosopher, with a good-humored smile. Xanthias displayed a couple of rich Copaic eels smoking beneath a crispy coat of beet-leaves. Placing them upon a clean damask napkin, spread over the tury mound which served as an impromptu tqble, he went to the riverside and drew from its crystal waters a wicker basket containing several flasks of Chian wine, and placed them on the table. Aristotle and Apelles each poured upon the ground a gen- erous libation to the Good Genius, and another to the nymphs of the Cephissus, which seemed, in the eyes of Xanthias, a needless waste of good things. To the fish succeeded woodcock,   COLONOS.       149 quails, and a noble pheasant. 4 Xanthias was right," said Aristotle, c in making a liberal al- lowance for a country appetite. I do not know when I have eaten so much and with such a relish." "This bread is exquisite in its flavor." "Yes; it is made of Chian wheat." '"That accounts for it. Bacchus and Ceres always smile on the same land. In my trav- els, I have invariably noticed that where the bread is good, the wine is always equally so. If you find the bread heavy, and of a sandy, sodden texture, spare yourself the trouble of ordering wine, for it is sure to turn out sour and rough to the taste." "I was not aware of that fact," said Aris- totle. "And I," said Xanthias, " thought I was the only man alive who knew it." Retiring to a short distance, he left his mas- ter and his friend engaged in conversation, and commenced the serious work of refection. The sharp edge of his appetite was taken off by the larger part of an enormous roasted hare. When this piece de resistance had done its duty, he amused himself with a couple of  150       APELLES. woodcocks and a bit of pheasant. Lastly, a handful of dried figs and a huge lump of Si- cilian cheese were used, as he expressed it, "to fill up the chinks." With a grunt of content, he held out -at arm's length a flask of Chian wine, undiluted by water, and sur- veyed it with eyes of delight. Then raising it high above his head, with open mouth he received a continuous stream, which he directed with such precision that it fell with a gurgling sound directly upon his palate, and was lost in the chasrp below. While the two friends indulged in a siesta, Xanthias packed up his basket with empty dishes, and placed them upon the donkey's back. It occurred to his ingenious and calcu- lating mind, that, as the panniers were now empty, the sturdy little fellow could well afford to carry him home. The Chian wine caused him to leave out of the calculation the fact that the greater part of the solid bulk of the panniers had been transferred to his own per- son, and his long and strong potation warned him that he could more safely trust to the safety of Jacky's steps than to his own legs. Accordingly, springing upon his back, astride   COLONOS.       151 of the panniers, he gave the beast a whack on the rear, and, with a yelling shout, urged him on his way home. Apelles started from his light slumber, and laughingly remarked, "If Sophocles were here, my friend, his faithful description of this scene would have been enlivened by the introduc- tion of the merry Silenus. Behold him in, all his glory!" Aristotle looked in the direction pointed out, and lost all his wonted gravity, on seeing his slave swaying from side to side in an undulating course through the green valley.

A RISTOPHANES. "t r.,   CHAPTER   XIL AFTER a few minutes of quiet repose and silent musing, Aristotle remarked that the sun was now declining, and proposed to stroll on to Plato's Academy, whose marble colonnades, relieved by groves of trees behind them, were seen at a short distance. The conversation took a political turn, and the artist listened with admiration to a Peripatetic lecture upon the general principles of government. The original ideas and well-developed theories of the master-mind which conceived them, have been too thoroughly incorporated into modern sys- tems and knowledge, to possess the charm of novelty, which made then so deeply interesting to Apelles. We shall, therefore, omit to report his remarks upon the merits and defects of the different constitutions of the Hellenic states, which he seemed to have studied in the same spirit, as he had studied the species of the     156       APELLES.  animal and vegetable kingdoms. We pass over his comments upon the attributes of the systems of democracy, oligarchy, and pure monarchy; his thoughts, expressed in the tersest language, have become with us house- hold words; but we cannot omit the splendid tribute of praise, which he enthusiastically paid to the glory of Athens. "You know, my friend, that by nature I am no partisan; I am only a seeker after truth. By birth I am not a citizen of Athens. I have been the friend of Philip and the teacher of Alexander. Make due allowance for the bias of my mind, and listen to my comments upon the democracy of Athens. Although I do not approve the practical work- ing of the system in all its branches, I cannot agree with the opinions of Plato and Xeno- phon respecting it. Look at yonder city. See what it has done for science, letters, and art. Survey the Acropolis; recall the tragedies of the Dionysiac theatre; examine its collec- tions of pictures, statues, and books; consider what statesmen have governed it, - Aristides, Themistocles, Miltiades, Pericles, and Conon! Where has such eloquence been heard as on   PLATO'S ACADEMY.     157 the Bema, from the Persian war down to the present day? "I do not know  Demosthenes personally, and I do not altogether approve his violence, but I understand him, and doubt not that he xwill one day be considered the most eloquent man that ever lived, as he is assuredly the most honest. I can sympathize with his en- thusiasm for his native city, and cannot blame him for his strenuous efforts to uphold her honor and her supremacy. As to the prudence of his measures, there is a difference of opin- ion even among honest men. Phocion, 'the incorruptible,' is his uncompromising antago- nist. Our friend JEschines does not love him, and nearly two years ago instituted a prosecution against Ctesiphon, who moved in the Five Hundred, that a golden crown should be decreed to Demosthenes, as a reward for his public services. The case has not yet been brought to a trial, and may be postponed for a number of years. The only point which Eschines has gained, is to deprive his rival for a time of the moral support which a for- mal testimony of his country's gratitude would have given him. When the great case of the     158       APELLES. 'Prosecution on the Crown,' shall come on, depend upon it, 1Eschines will fail. He may prove that the policy of Demosthenes has brought calamities on the country, which an opposite policy would have averted; but he cannot prove a single corrupt or mean or selfish act; he cannot prove an immoral act; he cannot even charge him with effeminacy or a love of pleasure. He may reproach him with being a water-drinker, as he is; he may say that his orations smell of the lamp, and ridicule the harshness of his voice, and the ungracefulness of his gestures. Demosthenes will rise, and the storm of the tumultuous assembly will be hushed  in silence. His meagre form will remind his countrymen that it has been wasted in labors for them; his earnest look, his concentrated brow, his close reasoning, and his clear and expressive phra- seology, will insure respect and command be- lief. By and by, lofty moral sentiments, breathing the pride of unsullied honor, will thrill the assembly, and place the multitude absolutely under his sway. Then the mighty names of the past will be summoned, invisible witnesses to the purity and integrity of his ?   PLATO'S ACADEMY.     159 public life. What a tumult of frantic ap- plause will greet that thin, spare man, as he winds up with an appeal of more than mortal energy! ' What will the taunt of ' water-drinking,' the poor jest of ' midnight oil,' or a sneer at the harsh tones of his voice be able to accom- plish against such a demoniac vehemence and power? This much, O Apelles, I, the friend and teacher of Alexander, say of Alexander's political opponent, because it is just. I think he has often misunderstood the motives and wronged the characters of both Philip and his son, in the overbearing ardor of his feelings and expressions." "May I ask, how you regard Alexander's projected expedition into Asia?" ,  "As a question of principle, I do not ap- prove of such enterprises, but I know Alex- ander well enough to be sure, that wherever he goes, he will carry the civilization of Greece. He will be no vulgar conqueror.  He will found cities, open avenues of commerce, estab- lish schools, libraries, and galleries of art. Whether he  can  permanently elevate the Asiatics to the Hellenic culture, is another     160       APELLES. question; but he will conquer first, and then attempt to civilize them. He will extend the boundaries of the Greek language and add immensely to the resources of science. He is high-spirited, generous, and brave as a young lion, but like a lion he is also impetuous. How he will bear the temptations of glory and absolute power on a gigantic scale, the gods only know, since they have made him what he is." "You have no doubt then of his success?" "Not the slightest. The characters of na- tions are diversified. In the northern regions they are full of spirit, but wanting in genius and art; therefore they are apt to be unpolished and unable to rule. The tribes of Asia are quick-witted and artful, but deficient in spirit, so that they are easily ruled and enslaved; but the Hellenic race, occupying a middle position, partake of both characters, for they are high-spirited and quick-witted. They have consequently remained free; they possess the- best political institutions, and if brought under one government, would be able to rule the world. Reasoning from these premises, I infer the probability of Alexander's success."   PLATO'S ACADEMY.     161 By this time they had come to a colonnaded enclosure, within which was a belt of trees, and under them marble seats facing the east. At the end of the enclosed space stood an elegantly carved chair, and before it a table inlaid with variegated marbles, from all the different quarries of Greece. On pedestals, placed at short distances, were busts of Soc- rates, Plato, Xenophon, and the other members of the immortal company, who listened to the incomparable teachings of the wittiest, wisest, and best among the ancients.? "' Here," said Aristotle, as they seated them- selves on one of the benches, "we used to listen in wonder to the lectures of Plato." "Whose name," said Apelles, "is revered by all artists as the greatest teacher of the beautiful." "And justly," rejoined Aristotle. "Plato was a marvellously gifted man. You notice in yon- der bust the extraordinary depth and breadth of the brow, the expression of power and calm meditation on the countenance. The ar- tist here is faithful to the life, and these out- ward features truly present the inner qualities of the man. He had a most capacious intellect, "     I(   162       APELLES. a singular, and perhaps unequalled, variety of talent. His imagination was brilliant, his reasoning concise and rigid. The broadest argument, the subtlest logic, and the most sophistical word-catching, were equally at his command. His common style was something between prose and poetry; but he sometimes descended to the merest colloquial idioms, and sometimes he soared into the highest regions of philosophical or descriptive eloquence, hav- ing the grandeur and frenzy of poetry, and lacking nothing but the rhythm. But the most remarkable of his talents was his prodigious dramatic power. His dialogues are all dramas; his characters being clearly conceived, and maintained and managed in all respects, in the most masterly manner.  However ab-    struse his discussions, they are always dramat- ically arranged, and the finishing touch is given to them  by the most natural by- play. Gorgias used to say that he never ut- tered a word of what Plato attributed to him; and many sentiments are by him given to Socrates, which I believe that great man never held; but, in his imitation of his manner of talking, -reproducing the subtlety of his irony, t' I    s   PLATO'S ACADEMY.     163 the keenness of his forward-reaching questions, i X  the urbanity of his satire, his wit never sur- passed, and the sublimity and purity of his 1}?: ethical views, -in all these respects he is won- ' S   derfully true. "His brilliant imagination, however, fre- quently led him into trains of thought, where I was obliged to differ from my master. I reason only from observed facts, and take no pleasure in theories purely speculative. For example, I cannot adopt the Platonic theory of ideas existing as archetypes in the Divine Mind before the existence of things, and serv- ing as patterns. It may be so, but we know nothing of the matter. To me it seems, that the speculation  on what lies beyond the X31  n knowledge and understanding of man, belongs in no sense to philosophy. I require the solid ground to stand upon, while Plato, with the instinct of the eagle, delights to lose himself in the clouds. ' "My practical inclination led me to in- vestigations of which Plato thought but little. I mean the study of natural objects,--of plants and animals.  Early in life, the secret charm of nature led me from the busy haunts of men A     164       APELLES. to observe the habits and study the organiza. tion of living things. At first, it was an agree- able relaxation only, but by degrees I began to suspect, that all the varieties of life were only parts of one stupendous design, the concep- tion of one great designer, a divinity existing above and beyond our myths of Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon. When facts shall have been ac- cumulated on facts for ages, then perhaps shall arise some man more fortunate than I, who may reduce the discords of this world into one great harmony, and spanning the interval be- tween created things and their Creator, shall read His thoughts in the beautiful adjustments of nature, as if they constituted a sublime epopee of creation." i Elev, O inspired Aristotle," exclaimed Apel- les. "If poetry has its frenzies, science seems to partake of its character. Judging by what you call your practical turn of mind, I little dreamed of seeing you snatch the lyre from the hand of Homer, and chant passages out of the epopee of the Universe!" "At all events," said Aristotle, "we must turn our steps towards the city, if we wish to reach home before sunset." it   ^     PLATO'S ACADEMY.     165 Accordingly, they struck into a path leading through the outer Ceramicus, noting, as they i walked, the inscriptions on the tombs of illus- l:v ttrious men, which solemnized their thoughts and accorded with the subjects of their dis- course. :Il  They entered the city by the Dipylon Gate, and passed through the Agora. The sight of the Pnyx, or place of meeting for popular as- semblies, on the right, and the Areopagus, or Hill of Mars, on the left, with the temple of the Eumenides at its foot, and further on, the prison in which Socrates died, would at any other time have been seen with lively emotion by the artist; but the day had been one of great excitement, and after a slight repast at home, he was glad to exchange a few words with Euphorus, and repose his wearied limbs upon a welcome couch.

ARISTOTLE, like most of his countrymen, was an early riser; and Apelles, who worshipped the sun as the great creator of color, was soon astir on the morning of the Dionysiac Festival. Euphorus joined them at the akratisma, the slight morning repast, and amused them by some piquant anecdotes, and an account of his adventures on the previous day. They were on the point of setting out for the theatre, when a loud knocking was heard at the front door, and 2Eschines made his appearance. He was attended by a slave carrying cush- ions and skiadeia, or sunshades, to be used in the theatre. Saluting his friends, he pro- posed to accompany them to the Prytaneumn, since they were to visit the theatre as guests of the city. They soon reached the Prytaneunl, where they found a large crowd already as- sembled. The Archon was there, with the     170       APELLES. Prytanes, dressed in their official robes. Here, also, they found the Macedonian ambassadors, and many distinguished visitors to, the city from the Chalcidic promontory, Asia Minor, and the islands of the IEgean Sea. A pro- cession was formed at once; and crowds of citizens, in holiday attire, joined it as it passed. Here and there a youth, with flowing locks, jaded expression, and the drawling lisp of the Athenian exquisite, would ask what was going on. On being told that a sterling tragedy of old Sophocles was to be represented, with an expression of supreme contempt he would pro- nounce such entertainments as "fit only for the days of the grasshoppers and the Diipolia," and stroll off in another direction. Jolly bands of rustics, spruced up for the oc- casion, were seen pouring in from the country. From the artisans' quarter, close at hand, camne a troop of tinmen, braziers, leather-dressers, tanners, and the like, all ready to criticize whatever should be submitted to their worship- ful judgment. Many a joke was cracked, and many a hearty laugh ran through the crowd, as the dignitaries of the state moved slowly on.   A DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL.    171 "I am glad," said a conceited and weak- voiced mercer, " that we are to have something of tried merit to-day, instead of the poor trash of original productions which we have lately heard at the Dionysion. At the Lenaeon we have fared better; we have had capital come- dies from Alexis and Amphis." "It is an ill wind which blows good to no one," said a master confectioner. "My trade at the theatre flourishes in proportion to the badness of the performance. If the poet fails to interest the audience, like sensible people they have recourse to the comfits which my boys hawk about the diazomata." "Who is that handsome man who walks so gracefully by the side of the Macedonian am- bassador?" asked one, of his neighbor. "It is Apelles, the great painter. They say he has brought millions of money to buy pic- tures for the Macedonian king." "Pictures? Men, I think; and, if I am not mistaken, one of his purchases walks on the other side of the ambassador." "What, Eschines? I remember him when he was a threadbare, half-starved stripling of eighteen. He now struts along as if he held     172       APELLES. a mortgage on the blue serene. What makes him so plump and sleek nowadays?" "I think," said a butcher, " it is his Bceotian farm. Boeotia is famous for its pork; and pork, you know, is very fattening." This was a sly hint at a rumor then current at Athens, that AEschines's farm, in Baeotia, had been purchased with money which he had re- ceived from King Philip. "The Stagirite is looking hale, fresh, and thoughtful as ever," was the last audible re- mark. The procession had now entered the "Street of the Tripods." In a slow and dignified march they passed by a succession of ar- chitectural monuments which, occurring at regular intervals, formed a continuous line on either side of the street. Each of these re- corded a brilliant dramatic victory. They were of various forms and designs, but each one was surmounted by the bronze tripod (emblem of Bacchus) which had been awarded to the vic- tor. Aristotle pointed out the inscriptions upon them, which gave the name of the successful candidate for fame, the year of his victory, and the name of the presiding Archon. From these   A DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL.   173 inscriptions, called "Didaskalie," Aristotle had composed a work under that title, containing, in substance, the history of the Attic stage. In one of them, Apelles read the name of Themistocles, and found that that great com- nander had, in the 76th Olympiad, acted as Choragus at the Dionysiac festival, and that Phrynichus was the poet, having at that time brought out the Phcenissa, just four years be- fore the appearance of iEschylus with the Persie. A discussion upon the comparative merits of zEschylus and Phrynichus was cut short by their arrival at the entrance of the theatre. Here they found an immense crowd of citi- zens pressing eagerly forward, each one with his symbo/on, or ticket, purchased with the two- obol piece which he had on the day before received from the Theoricon. The Mastigophoroi, or police of the theatre, made all haste to clear the way for the Archon and his illustrious company. He ushered them to the seats usually assigned to persons of distinction, and now appropriated to their use by an express vote of the Senate. They were a portion of the lowest tier of seats, next to     174       APELLES. the Orchestra, and admirably adapted to see and hear what was passing on the stage. Euphorus was much amused to witness the officiousness of the attendants in beating up and settling cushions on the marble seats, and arranging the sunshades to protect the heads of the company from the sun. In some instances these services were rendered to eminent men by their clients, who, snatching the cushions from the hands of a slave, claimed the honor of wai*g upon their patrons. An indescribable scene of confusion now fol- lowed, An innumerable multitude of men and boys were pushing each other, symbol in hand, to find their places. Then arose such a clamor, such a shouting, such scrambling and tumbling heels over head, as must have disturbed the gravity of the very owls of Minerva. It did not last long, however. In about ten minutes after the Archon had taken his place, the vast throng of thirty thousand spectators had found their way through the ample alleys and pas- sages, or, to speak more technically, the kirk- ides and diazomata, and every man and boy was in his seat. The women had already been placed, occupying the upper portion of   A DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL.    175 the enormous semicircle of ascending seats, which stretched far up the slope of the Acrop- olis. The gay and brilliant colors of their dresses, and the fluttering of fans from the cel- ebrated mart of Phocis, gave them the appear- ance of a row of butterflies hovering over the scene. A gentle murmur of suppressed conver- sation arose, and Apelles had leisure to survey the imposing spectacle before him. The magnificent theatre, though it had been used for scenic representations and other public purposes for more than a century, was but just completed under the direction of Lycurgus, the celebrated orator, who administered the finances of the city with equal ability and integrity for twelve years. The gigantic structure was now in all the freshness of its magnificence. The marble seats, the colonnaded gallery above the upper tier; the stage, and noble architectural fronts of palaces and temples; the highly orna- mented paraskenia, the side-buildings with apartments furnishing every convenience for the numerous officials and artists connected with the dramatic and other liturgies; the shaded walks in the rear; the beautiful sky- the only ceiling-with the grand outline of     176       APELLES. the distant mountains, blending the attrac- tions of nature with the splendors of art,-  presented a combination of objects which filled with delight the cultivated mind of the painter. After a general survey, his attention was especially attracted by a series of Choragic monuments in the upper part of the theatre, similar in character to those he had seen in  the Street of the Tripods, -like them, bearing  inscriptions recording musical, dramatic, and orchestral victories. Three bronze statues of JESCHYUS, SoPHocLES, and EURIPIDES, the three unequalled masters of the tragic stage, next met his admiring gaze.  These noble works had been placed there by Lycurgus only the day before. Standing on richly or- namented pedestals, they occupied three niches, one on each side of the central door of the stage, and one directly over it. As the eyes of the multitude fell on their countenances, illumined by the morning light, and now seen for the first time, they sent up a shout which filled the concave arch of the sky.

PROGRAMME. "Eteocles and Polynices, the two brothers of Antigone, have fallen by each other's hands, and the Argive army has been defeated before the walls of Thebes. Creon, who has obtained the tyranny, interdicts, under- penalty of death, the burial of Polynices. Antigone, however, mindful of her brother's request to her in their last interview, resolves to break the edict and perform those rites, so indispensably sacred in the eyes of a Greek. Acting on these resolutions, she baffles the vigilance of the guards, and buries the corpse. Creon, on learning that his edict has been disobeyed, orders the remains to be disinterred; and Antigone, in a second attempt to inter them, is discovered, brought before him, and con- demned to perish by hunger in the cavern of a rock. Antigone is borne away to her doom, sustaining herself with this one comfort, that she shall go to her grave dear to her parents and to her brother.  In the end, through the denunciations of Tiresias and the intercessions of the Chorus, Creon relents. But it is too late; on entering the cavern, he (finds Antigone dead, and her affianced lover, Hsemon, lying beside, with his arms clasped around her waist. The conclusion of the play leaves Creon the only wretched survivor, his wife and children having perished."   A DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL.    179 Our readers must remember that mask, co- thurnus and costume, were among the most indispensable properties of the Attic theatre; and that the talent of the mask-maker, who could clothe the works of his art with the varied ex- pressions of the characters intended by the poet, was almost in as great request as the genius of the sculptor. The masks and dresses of the Antigone had long been established, and were familiar to the public. The characters them- selves, and the sentiments to which they gave utterance in the course of the action, were al- most known by heart; and yet this familiarity, so far from lessening, served to deepen the rapture called out by seeing successive repre- sentations. This is the true test of a work of the highest genius, whether in poetry or art. It must be confessed, however, that, what- ever advantages the ancient actor derived from mask and costume, by the aid of which he rep- resented his dramatic character to the eye as well as the mind, avoiding the ludicrous incongruity which often would exist between the actual fea- tures of the player and the ideal person of the god or hero he represented, yet he lost something by the impossibility of varying his expression     180       APELLES. from moment to moment, as the plot went on. The delivery, also, bore little resemblance to the varied tones and natural action of the modern stage. It was something between reading and chanting, very solemn in its effect, and the ac- tion was stately and statuesque rather than such as men exhibit in real life. Our readers who have learned to appreciate the beauties of the Italian opera, which our forefathers ridiculed as absurd and unnatural, (witness Steele's paper on the subject in the Spectator,) must endeavor to imagine a species of dramatic performance equally elevated above ordinary nature by all the appliances and devices of pure art. We shall not attempt to follow the players through the performance. Tie appreciation of the cultivated Athenian audience was evinced by breathless attention, occasionally interrupted by most judicious applause. On the entrance of the tyrant Creon, AEs- chines, who had not been particularly interested by the sentiments or action of the preceding scenes, was all alive with attention, --not a look or word escaped him. He was evidently in a critical mood; and at the close of the king's part, which was in truth well enacted,   A DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL.       181 he ventured to hiss, but was not responded to. "That fellow," said he, between his teeth, "de- serves to be scourged by the Mastigophoros, in sight of the audience." * Apelles turned with an inquiring glance to Aristotle, who sat by his side. "Our friend zEschines," whispered the philos- opher, with  a smile,  used to act this very part when a youngster, -   and- you need not mention it-was invariably hissed.    He doubt- less thinks the performance of yonder player decidedly inferior to his own, and is taking vengeance for the treatment he used to receive, and always resented. f The decided hit of the day was the scene where Antigone, having been detected in ren- dering burial honors to the dead body of her deceased brother, is confronted with the king, who had issued a decree forbidding any one to perform those rites to Polynices, under a pen- alty of death. CREON. Thee, thee, with earthward bending look, I ask, Dost thou deny, or dost confess the deed? 3 The successful actor was rewarded by a prize, which was sometimes a sum of money in addition to his salary; but one who made a signal failure did not escape with hisses alone, but was ordered to be scourged, and the punishment was summarily ad- ministered on the stage! t Dem. de Corona, s 180 & 265.     182           APELLES.

Every word of this passage, spoken with dauntless humility, and in a tone of subduing and pathetic resolution, told with accumulating effect upon the feelings of the audience. JEs- chines was in tears; and Aristotle himself, the serene and reflective sage, could hardly master his struggling emotions. For a moment, silence, broken only by sighs, reigned throughout the theatre; then rose such vehement shouts, such clapping of hands, such passionate and almost frantic outcries, that for a moment it was impossible for the play to proceed. ' This tempest of feeling,' said Aristotle, when it had subsided, his like one of our summer typhoons, which, rising in a moment on the slopes of Mount Parnes, fills the plains of Attica with clouds of dust, and the air with swift-driving, black masses of vapor, seeming on the point of mingling earth and sky in one general darkness and uproar, when, as suddenly as it came, it scuds over to the sea, vanishes in the distance, and--the sun bursts forth in fresh and renewed splendor!" In mournful silence they listened to the nar-     184        APELLES. rative describing Haemon dying, encircling the dead body of his betrothed with weakening  arms, "The dead with dead the nuptial rites receiving, Unhappy one! in Hades' dread abode, Giving a proof to humaln kind how far Intemperate counsel is the greatest ill To man." When the last warning words of the chorus closed the tragedy, the audience, in a thunder of applause, expressed their admiration of the piece and their sympathy with the fortunes of the heroine. As a long interval occurred between the first performance and another which was to follow, many of the crowd began to regale themselves with refreshments which they had brought with them; others, more practical, sallied forth into the streets, and, lighting small fires in chafing dishes, set about cooking a hearty dinner. ZEschines was busily arguing with an eager knot of politicians. Aristotle and Apelles, un- willing to efface the impressions which  the great poet had made, walked silently home, the former revolving in his mind the abstract principles of poetry, and the latter deducing from the same ideas rules for practice in the kindred art of painting.

DURING the sojourn of Apelles at Athens, there occurred an event which, although be- longing more properly to the province of his- tory, was too intimately connected with the adventures of our hero, to be passed over in silence. In the incredibly short space of four months, Alexander had, with an army of thirty thousand, crossed Mount Haemus, conquered the Triballi, passed over the Danube, received the submission of Scythia, and subdued the Taulantii and Illyrians. Deceived by a false report of his death, the powerful city of Thebes declared itself independent of the Macedonian rule, and the Athenians were on the point of following her example, when, in the month of August, Alexander, by long forced marches, ap- peared at Onchestos, before the Thebans had any notice of his movements. The city was     188       APELLES. taken by assault, and its inhabitants butchered or sold into slavery. Every building within the walls was then razed to the ground, with the exception of the house of Pindar, which was ordered to stand as a monument of Alex- ander's veneration for the arts. From Thebes he sent an ambassador to Athens, demanding the delivery of the persons of ten of her most renowned orators, including Demosthenes, and Lycurgus, the distinguished treasurer of the city. Athens was thrown into a state of utter consternation. Thousands of citizens were seen hurrying towards the Pnyx, to hold a popular assembly.  Loud complaints were made against the demagogues, whose rash lan- guage and councils had brought such a ca- lamity upon Thebes, and now threatened Athens. Demosthenes addressed the excited multitude, and having gained their attention, first calmed their fears and then offered coun- sel. He related a fabled compact, made be. tween a flock of sheep and a wolf: The wolf agreed to protect the defenceless sheep on condition that their watch-dogs should be given up. He compared the Athenians to the   THEBES. ART-PURCHASES.    189 sheep, their orators to faithful watch-dogs, and the Macedonian to an arch-wolf.* Appealing to the mercantile portion of his audience, he asked, if they had not seen whole cargoes of grain sold by the formal delivery of a small sample.  ('Thus, O Athenians," said he, " deliver us, orators, a handfill of men, Sand you sell yourselves, your wives and chil- dren to the Macedonian.?' After a stormy debate, it was voted to send an embassy to deprecate the wrath of Alex- ander, and to promise a cessation of rebellious movements. The result of this mission is too well known to require a detailed account- of it. Athens obtained less rigorous terms from the clemency of Alexander, the democracy was humiliated, and the Macedonian party triumphant. Such was the state of affairs in September, when Apelles had nearly completed his arrangements for returning to Pella. His time had been fully and most agreeably occupied. By the advice of his host, he had allotted the latter portion of each day to the ' A playful substitution of the word " t'voZtVor " for " luvap Xof."     190       APELLES. reception of visitors. Crowds of wealthy, enli- nent, and well-born citizens came daily to these' receptions to welcome the illustrious stranger, and to solicit his presence at ban- quets and festivals, which would have done honor to the king himself. These, of course, were not, generally speaking, members of the busy, intriguing, and turbulent democratic party, but citizens whose wealth, birth, and position in society left them nothing to desire except a feeling of permanent security and an established order of things. They felt that their fortunes were always at stake so longc as an excitable populace might at any time be aroused by their orators to declare a war, the expenses of which would fall heavily on men of property; and they looked upon an alliance with the military monarch of Mace- donia as their only safeguard. Such an alli- ance promised to keep down any quarrels or disputes between the rival states of Greece, and t( protect them from the incursions of northern marauders. The splendors of a court and the patronage of a generous monarch were secretly sighed for; and it was with eager haste and assiduity that they vied with   THEBES. ART-PURCHASES.   191 each other in rendering homage to one who was so well known as the favorite friend of Alexander. The effect of Apelles's visit was as brilliant as the king had anticipated. His agreeable manners and his graceful and elegant bearing, daily won him friends. The descrip- tion he gave of the talents and personal quali- ties of his master, were listened to with intense satisfaction and interest; -they came from the heart, and were, consequently, eloquent and persuasive. Whenl le explained the policy and gigantic plans of the young Macedonian hero, the petty strife and bickering dissensions of their own states sunk into the insignificance of family broils. "In a word," said YEschines one day, "Alexander is the fashion, and De- mosthenes is voted vulgar. The mercers tell me that articles of Macedonian manufacture have become all the rage. A pastry cook has in- vented a new style of tart, formed of braids of flaky paste, enveloping rich preserves, which meets with great success under the name of ' Tle Gordian Knot.' I am daily expecting," he added playfully, tapping the shoulders of Euphorus, 'that my young friend here will soon be immortalized by the barbers of the     192       APELLES. Agora, proclaiming to their customers that they are prepared to dress and curl hair in the genuine, Euphorean style." His mornings were devoted to the more serious, but not less congenial, business of making a collection of works of art, which brought him in contact with all the most distinguished artists and connoisseurs. They were naturally flattered by a visit from a painter, who, by common consent, ranked as the first artist of the day. He was so gener- ous and just in his appreciation of the excel- lencies of others, that every word of praise which fell from his lips had a double value in the estimation of the delighted recipient. It may be readily supposed, that he was fre- quently consulted by artists, and that his crit- icisms of works yet unfinished were often asked as a favor. In such cases, by his judi- cious suggestions, or by imparting some valu- able information, drawn from his own expe- rience or practice, he was enabled to render many valuable services, which were most grate- fully acknowledged. Whenever he inquired the price of a picture or statue, the artist, greedy of the honor of having made a sale to   THEBES. ART-PURCHASES.    193 the great Apelles, invariably named a sum so reasonable, that he had no occasion to lose time in bargaining; and, in the course of a few months, he had secured some thirty or forty of the finest works. Beside pictures and statues, he had made a large collection of engraved gems and cameos of the choicest workmanship. His practised eye enabled him to decide on the merits of such works with so much precision, that whenever he had made a selection of some few pieces, the proprietor felt that his collection had been drained of its choicest specimens. In the selection of books he was greatly as- sisted by Aristotle and his literary friends. His purchases of rare and valuable editions swept clear the shelves of nearly all the first- class bibliopoles. All these acquisitions were prudently made in his own name; for he was well aware, that if it were known that the treasures of Macedonia were open to him, the prices would naturally rise in proportion. Such extensive purchases could not fail to attract attention, and to ex- cite the cupidity of a large class of citizens. Many disappointed artists complained that he 13     194       APELLES. was in the hands of a clique, who had spite- fully deprived them of their due share of the golden shower which was now descending upon the studios of Athens. He was already widely known as a ready buyer of all that was rare and valuable. and his person had acquired a notoriety not without its inconveniences. Passing through the Agora with zEschines and Euphorus, one morning, he was accosted by a citizen, who, respectfully apologizing for the liberty he took in addressing so illustrious a personage, in- formed him that he knew of an exquisite masterpiece by Zeuxis, in the possession of a barber, who was entirely ignorant of its real value  "Give me but ten drachmas," said he, "and I will conduct you to his house, where, for a mere song, you may obtain a picture worthy of a place in the cabinet of a king." Apelles, whose knowledge of art had enabled him to secure several works of great and strik- ing merit, unappreciated by their owners, was gravely considering the plausible proposition, when Euphorus, in spite of a change of dress and the disguise of a dark-colored wig, in-   THEBES.

In the short space of a month or two thou hast thrown off the weight and infirmity of twenty years. Have those leeches so completely restored thy daughter, that thou art now at leisure to con. duct me to the fair maiden, who is dying for love of me? I will follow thee with pleas- ure." I know not to what you allude," said the brazen-faced rogue. "I have never had the honor of meeting you before." "Really?" said Euphorus; " thy memory can easily be refreshed, for behind thee stands a grim and sturdy Agoranomos, ready to scourge thy back as a cheat and public nui- salce." As the hare starts at the baying of the hounds, running, doubling, and running again, even so at the sound of the awful, terror- striking word "Agoranomos," did the trembling culprit start, dive into the crowd, and, taking a devious course hither and thither, was soon lost to sight.     196       APELLES. As the fellow's antecedents were unknown to Apelles, he was unable to understand this strange little episode; and both Agschines and Euphorus were for a long time too much amused to give any intelligible explanation. "I cannot sufficiently admire," said 2Es- chines, "the ready ingenuity with which you presented to his imagination the graphic image, that instantly robbed him of all presence of mind.  He had not the courage even to turn round and ascertain whether your statement was true. It was a rhetorical touch, worthy of Demosthenes himself." "The great leader has been unusually silent since the destruction of Thebes, I believe," said Apelles. "True," replied 2Eschines, who was in the highest spirits; " he begins to be aware that it is one thing to excite a few thousand Athe- nians, by wagging his tongue on the Bema, and another to confront an army of thirty or forty thousand Macedonians, who have won, every battle in which they have engaged. He is at this moment decidedly unpopular, and my friends are urging me to push the   THEBES. ART-PURCHASES.   197 "; Prosecution on the Crown."  I am determined to be thoroughly prepared, so that, when I do take it up, little will be left of the great orator." This was spoken with the confi- dence of one who anticipated full success,- an anticipation which was never realized.       PHRYNE - PRAXITELES.     ON THE PICTURE OF VENUS BY APELLES. When, from the bosom of her parent flood, She rose refulgent with the encircling brine, Apelles saw Cythera's form divine, And fixed her breathing image where it stood.

As Apelles was one day walking in company with MEschines and his young pupil, a sumptu- ous and stately equipage approached. It was a chariot of white and gold, drawn by four milk- white steeds, and driven by a tall charioteer, who was standing in front, with a small boy at his side. On the back seat, a lady of most ex- quisite beauty, and attired with regal magnifi- cence, reclined on cushions of rose-colored silk. At her side, a small lapdog lay sleeping upon a carpet of the softest wool of Miletus. As it came abreast of our party, the lady, who seemed totally unconscious of the sensation which she made in the crowded streets, cast her eyes upon Apelles, and, tapping the boy with her fan, gave orders to the charioteer to halt. Apelles, approaching the carriage with a smile, saluted the lady with the ease and cor- diality of an old acquaintance.     202       APELLES. "Ye gods!" exclaimed Euphorus, whose vis- ion was utterly dazzled by her charms; " what lovely creature is that? Does Cythera dare to appear in the city of Athena?" ' That, my friend," said JEschines, "is the great Athenian beauty, the celebrated Phrynel Her history is a singular one. Born of humble parents in Thespiae, a city of Bceotia, in early life she gained her livelihood by manual labor on the farms in this neighborhood. A wondrous development of personal attractions soon made her the unrivalled cynosure of all eyes. The society of the well-born, the learned, and the witty have so far cultivated her mind and re- fined her manners, that the charms of her con- versation may be said to rival those of her person. She was the model of the Venus Anadyomene, which Apelles painted for the temple of Cos, and of the statue which Praxit- eles made for the Cnidians. Both of these works deserve to be immortalized by the poets." "She must be very wealthy to support such state,' remarked Euphorus. "You may form some idea of her unbounded means from the fact, that, after the destruction of Thebes, she offered to rebuild its walls, on   PHRYNE - PRAXITELES.    203 condition of being allowed to place on them this inscription:- 'DESTROYED BY ALEXANDER, AND REBUILT BY PHRYNE OF THESPIP."  During this conversation, an immense throng had nearly filled the street with admiring gazers. The fair Phryne sat conversing with Apelles, on whom she lavished "nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles," with the ease and grace of a belle in a ball-room. The horses champed, pawed, and foamed with impatience, until Apel- les, gracefully saluting the beauty, returned to his friends. The crowd slowly made way; and it was with difficulty that the charioteer could avoid crushing the eager spectators, who, iti their admiration, seemed to have lost all presence of mind and care for life or limb. ( Happy man!" said ,Eschines to his friend; 4 you have excited the envy of hundreds who witnessed those priceless smiles." "The fair Phryne," said Apelles, "has lost none of her beauty since I saw her at Eleusis. If possible, time has only added to' her charms. Is there any truth in a vague report I heard, that she has been in danger of her life?"     204       APELLES. "It is too true," replied JEschines. "Euthias, prompted by what feelings I cannot conceive, prosecuted her, on some frivolous ground, in the court of the Heliaea, for the crime of im- piety,- always a most dangerous accusation to bring before an Athenian tribunal. To the sur- prise of all, his argument was so cunningly framed and insisted upon in certain legal points, that he evidently impressed upon the judges the idea that they had no alternative left but to condemn her. It was, in short, a matter of life and death. tHyperides, the orator, who was one of her admirers, undertook her defence. Per- ceiving that his legal arguments had little or no effect on the minds of the judges, he had re- course to a masterly stratagem. He called the accused to the Bema, as if to ask some ques- tions; and her beauty, grace, and captivating manners pleaded more forcibly in her favor than all the tongues of all the Athenian orators com- bined could have done. She was acquitted unani- mously, and Euthias has from that day declined ever to appear again in the courts of justice." "She certainly has a wonderfully brilliant wit and quickness of perception," said Apelles, thoughtfully.   PHRYNE - PRAXITELES.    205 "Yes, and lately gave a very striking proof of it. Praxiteles offered to allow her to choose from his costly works any one she might prefer. She endeavored to ascertain his estimate of their comparative merits, but he declined giving his opinion, saying that an artist was not a fair judge of his own works. Finding it impossible to get a direct answer from him, she retired for a moment, (for the interview took place at her own house,) and gave instructions to one of her slaves to rush in with the pretended news that a fire had broken out in the studio of Praxiteles. and destroyed all its contents. The terrified ar- tist tore his hair, and exclaimed that he was un- done if either the Cupid or the Satyr were lost. "' Calm your fears, my friend,' said Phryne, with the sweetest of her smiles. 'I have had recourse to my invention, in order to learn which of your works you really prefer. Your studio is safe; and, of the two statues you have men- tioned, I select the Cupid.' Accordingly, she received it, and sent it as a present-to the tem- ple of her native, city." 1"I should like to pay a visit to Praxiteles," said Apelles; "I have never had the pleasure of meeting him."     206        APELLES. '"His studio is near at hand," said AEschines; "and I shall be proud of the honor of presenting you." On hearing the name of Apelles, Praxiteles, a young and handsome man of most agreeable address, warmly pressed the hand of his distin- guished visitor, and expressed his thanks for so great an honor as a visit from Apelles. "And yet," said he, gayly, "' it is but a fair return to me for a visit which I made to Cos, merely to see your picture of Venus. We have both been inspired by the same glorious original; but, when I saw your copy, I sighed to think I was not a painter." "The sister arts we worship," replied Apelles, "have attractions which, though equal, are not rivals. I cannot help wishing that I were a sculptor, as I recognize in this statue a faithful portrait of the all-perfect Phryne." "' You think it like her, then?" said Praxiteles, removing some drapery from a pedestal on which stood a golden statue of the Thespioean beauty. On the pedestal Apelles read, "Phryne of Thespice, daughter of Epicles." Apelles could not sufficiently express his ad- miration of the exquisite work before him. The   PHRYNE - PRAXITELES.    207 texture of its light drapery, slightly tinged with a purple hue, contrasted finely with that of the flesh, which was of dead gold. Here and there a band or ornament, with a bright, burnished surface, gave a sparkling richness and finish to the work. It rested on a pedestal of the whitest Pentelic marble. Praxiteles was highly delighted by the enthu- siastic and appreciating remarks of the painter, and said,- "A number of her friends, under the belief that there never was, and never will be again, a mortal being of such divine perfection, deter- mined to hand down   to incredulous posterity her portrait, as a subject for their admiration. They accordingly subscribed a sum  of money sufficient to have it executed in the most costly material, and propose to deposit it in the temple of Delphi." '"This work," said Apelles, " proves to me that you have the eye of a painter, and re- quire only the manual dexterity to become one. The light purple hue of your drapery and the subdued yellow of the gold form a truly harmonious contrast; and the burnished ornaments are distributed, like the high lights     208       APELLES. of a picture, with great judgment and masterly effect." Praxiteles looked deeply gratified. "I am glad," said he, " that this mode of treatment meets with your approval. Many of the old school come here and shake their heads, saying, ' This is not the school of old Phidias.' " "I should be sorry if it were," said Apelles. ' Every artist's works should present that which is peculiar to himself. Because Sophocles wrote sublime tragedies, does it follow that Aristophanes ought never to have written com- edy? How absurd! The genius of Phidias was Homeric. Your style seems to me a mix- ture of that of Anacreon and Sappho combined. Who can regret that these two exquisite poets never attempted Epic subjects?" An hour or two was passed in examining the various models and drawings of the artist, dur- ing which Euphorus had the pleasure of listen- ing, in silence, to a most interesting conversa- tion, carried on between the greatest painter and the most renowned sculptor of the day.

MOORE'S ANACREON.   CHAPTER XVI. BY the middle of September, Apelles had completed the extensive purchases, which had occupied him nearly half a year. His thoughts turned homeward, where a mother and sister were anxiously expecting him. Euphorus had spent his time most agreeably and profitably. When not in the instructive company of his master and  the learned Aristotle, his days were divided between visits to collections of art, the studios of eminent painters or sculp- tors, and a host of young and accomplished men, with whom he had formed a friendship, which he felt would last for a lifetime. His knowledge of his art and  of the world had been greatly enlarged, and he longed to return and devote himself, heart and soul, to the profession which had obtained for his master so distinguished a reception at Athens. Apelles had decided to ship his treasures at     212        APELLES. the neighboring seaport of Piraeus, and to make a voyage home in the same vessel They were already packed in cases and placed on board. Alexander was on his way to Pella, and Apelles hoped to arrive soon after his royal master. He parted with regret from his host, who, with zEschines, accompanied him to Piraeus, and bade him adieu on the deck of the "Evv/qepta," or "Fair Day."* "The name of your vessel," said 2schines, "presages a prosperous voyage, which, may the gods grant you." On embracing Aristotle, Apelles was deeply moved. "My friend," said he, " the pleasure I have enjoyed in your society for five months, makes my parting with you painful. We have freely interchanged our thoughts and senti- ments on all subjects; and when two men, who have anything in common, have done so, sincere friendship is the result. If love be the honey of life, friendship is the bread whose permanent relish continues unabated. I shall never forget your kindness, nor the lessons of wisdom, which I feel have elevated my soul and made me, in some degree, worthy of your regard." X See Note 1.   RETURN TO PELLA.     213 "And I," said Aristotle, " shall always count the friendship of Apelles as one of my greatest honors and pleasures." After kindly and cordially saluting Euphorus, and expressing a hope that all should meet again, the Athenians departed, and the Mace- donians set sail with a fair wind. We shall not dwell on the pleasures of his voyage down the Saronic Gulf, whence, passing along the Island of Eginla, Apelles pointed out to Euphorus the temple of Jupiter Pan- hellenius. His course led around the promon- tory of "Sunium's height," through the Cycla- des, and thence along the eastern coast of Euboea. On the coast of Magnesia, he be- held in succession the mountains of Pelion, Ossa, and Olympus, all consecrated by the immortal verse of Homer. Lastly, ascending the Thermaic Gulf, he landed at Therma, lately called Thessalonica, by Philip, in honor of his daughter. Therma was the nearest port to Pella, and Apelles here made a requisition upon the garrison for a supply of horses and wagons to convey his precious stores safely to Pella, where he arrived after a slow jour- ney of two or three days. On entering Pella,     214       APELLES. he had the pleasure of learning, that Alexan- der had arrived only the night before; and he sent his pictures, statues, and other purchases to the royal palace, and, parting from Eu- phorus, went directly to his own house. He had hardly crossed the threshold, when Ero- phile, his mother, a comely matron, and his sister Zoe, a lovely girl of seventeen, rushed into his arms. When the first transports of meeting after so long an absence had sub- sided, the latter left the room to order refresh- ments for the wearied traveller. "Zoe has suddenly grown very beautiful," said Apelles. "If she had been with me il Athens, I could have disposed of her hand to one of at least fifty persons, superior in birith and fortune to any to be found in Pella." "I am glad you had not an opportunity," said Eropyile, cheerfully. ( I could not spare her at present, and do not approve of mar- riages with strangers at such a distance.- ' Where the drachma is coined, there it passes for the most money.'" "A sententious proverb, good mother. We shall see what can be done for her here, then.   RETURN TO PELLA.     215 We have no need to be in a hurry to give her away." After dinner a large case was unpacked, containing presents for his mother and sister, which consisted principally of the richest ar- ticles and ornaments of female apparel af- forded by the shops of the Athenian Agora. Zoe did not disdain to deck her dark brown hair with the golden grasshoppers of the Athe- nian maids; she pronounced this armlet as "perfectly lovely," and that set of agraffes as "ravishing." The time passed rapidly in con- versation and anecdote until a late hour of the night. On the following morning, Apelles hastened to pay his respects to Alexander. Arriving at the palace, he was ushered into a large hall, usually devoted to festive cele- brations. It was now encumbered with the boxes and bales which he had brlught with him from Greece. Many of themtad been already opened, and heaps of straw and other packing materials were carelessly strewn about the marble pavement. At the farther end of the room, our painter beheld the stately form of Olympias, the queenly mother of Alexander,     216       APELLES. seated in a chair, contemplating an exquisite picture by Zeuxis, which was resting against a marble column.  Making the best of his way between the still unopened cases, he ap- proached her with great ceremony, and ex- pressed his sense of the high honor of being admitted to her royal presence. Although re- ceived by Alexander on the footing of a friend, he never neglected to pay to Olympias the most obsequious homage and ceremonious re- spect, which her own stately bearing seemed to exact. The formality of her cordial reception of the painter, fully expressed her own sense of the degree of condescension with which she honored the friend and favorite of her son. "The king," said she, smiling, " will be de- lighted to see you again in good health. At present he is in the council-room, but will soon be at leisure. What treasures of art you have brought from the Athenian capital! You perceive that our curiosity has led us to make an early and prompt examination. We have employed at least fifty porters, laborers,' and carpenters this morning, which may account for the warehouse air of this reception-room.   RETURN TO PELLA.      217 The king has been so much interested, and so eager to gratify his curiosity, that he has opened several of the smaller cases with his own hands." Drawing from his girdle a small casket, Apelles begged her acceptance of a gem, "which,"' said he, "I fancied might be not without interest to the queen." He touched a spring, and displayed a ring, containing a large engraved amethyst, and an impression from it. It was an exquisite head of Jupiter Ammon; between richly flowing locks, like those which usually adorh the heads of Bacchus, were seen the graceful spiral lines of a ram's horn, surrounding the ear. "How like my son!" said Olympias, ad- miringly, "and "--adding in a lower tone, but distinct enough for Apelles to hear, -" how like his father! * "I was struck by its resemblance to the king," said Apelles, "and purchased it in hope that his royal mother would recognize it also. It is the more remarkable as coming ' The boast of Olympias, that Alexander was the son of Am- mon, and not of Philip, is too well known to require explana- tion.     218       APELLES. from the hand of a renowned artist, who died a half century since." "It possesses a double interest in my eyes," replied Olympias, significantly, " and I cannot too highly appreciate the delicacy with which you have shown your regard for me." Alexander here entered, and after formally saluting his mother, gave to Apelles the right- hand-clasp. "Welcome to Pella again, my friend. I have been enjoying the fruit of your unwearied labors in my behalf," said he, pointing to the rich collection before him. "I myself have not been idle." He then gave a short and condensed summary of his proceedings down to the destruction of Thebes, and his demand of the persons of the Athenian orators as hostages. "What answer did you give to the Athc- nians?" asked Olympias. "I abated somewhat of my conditions," re- plied Alexander, " and did so cheerfully." "And wherefore?" asked the queen, with a look of proud defiance and masculine energy. "Before yielding one iota to their insolent pretensions, I would have marched with an   RETURN TO PELLA.     219 army to their capital, which, with all its riches and splendor, should have shared the fate of Thebes; her proudest citizens should have been made hewers of wood and drawers of water, and the unburied bodies of her turbulent orators given a prey to dogs and birds!" "Nay, royal mother," said Alexander, respect- fully but firmly; " that would have ill accorded with my policy. My desire is to enlarge and improve Greece, not to destroy it. If, as was foreshadowed by dreams, my mother has brought into the world a burning brand, let it prove a torch of light, not one of destruc- tion. In my late demands I asked much in order to gain a little, as the shopkeepers say. Athens has humiliated herself sufficiently by supplicating pardon and mercy, and for the present I have more important objects in view than the gratification of a feeling of revenge. - But what pretty thing is that, which seems to engage your attention?" "It is a most acceptable present, which your friend has brought me from Athens,-a like- ness of my son." "Does it really resemble me?" asked Alex-     220       APELLES. ander, surveying the god-like features with in- terest and complacency. "So much so, that had you sat to the ar- tist for your portrait, it could not have sur- passed this one." "With your permission, then, I will use it as a signet-ring, and adopting the design of it for my coins, will hand down to posterity the features--of the son of Olympias." As soon as she had retired, Alexander lay- ing aside the ceremony, which  he always maintained in her presence, seated himself familiarly by the side of Apelles. "Well done!" said he, smiling; " you have put the queen into the most agreeable of humors. She is now more fully persuaded than ever in her belief, that the blood of Ammon runs through these veins; but, 0 my friend," continued he, exhibiting a slight scratch on his finger, which he had lacer- ated in his haste to open a small case, "this is no immortal ichor, but vulgar human blood! It reminds me, however, that I have mundane affairs on hand. I have examined your most exact and clerkly account of the sums you have expended for me, and am astonished   RETURN TO PELLA.     221 to see how reasonably you have secured these treasures. You might have brought home one half of them, and I should have been well satisfied. I do not see that you have charged any thing for your own expenses, or those of the lad, Euphorus." "The generous hospitality of your friends left me no occasion to spend money at Athens; and all the expenses of the journey thither and back, were defrayed by the officer who commanded the expedition. I blush to say, that we both of us have had so many costly presents forced upon us by your friends, that we return much richer than we went." He then gave a minute account of his ad- ventures and experiences during his absence; he had many messages and compliments from eminent and distinguished Athenians to com- municate, and did not fail to paint the sur- prise and pleasure of Aristotle, on seeing so unexpected a dish as the chromis smoking at his own board, on the first day when he entertained them. "The young dog," said he, " took me as much by surprise as he did the old philosopher, and had the grace also to yield to you the credit of the present, which gave it a triple value."     222       APELLES. "He is a generous and spirited youth," said Alexander, "to whom  I heartily wish suc- cess." In the course of the  conversation, fre- quent quotations from observations made by JEschines, being introduced, Alexander re- marked,- "Poor JEschines, I fear, is not overburthened with the good things of this world. He has been accused, unjustly, of receiving money from me; and his intimacy with you, during your stay at Athens will, perhaps, tend to give a coloring of truth to the charge. It is hard that he should bear the odium without the benefit of the crime. I should be sorry to have my friends suffer on account of their fidelity to my cause, and I shall write to Aristotle to make him a handsome present in his own name, so that jEschines may receive it without compromising his honor. By so doing, I shall be able to save my friend from the severe temptation of poverty, and enjoy also the pleasure of the gods, who dispense favors with unseen hands. But, tell me, Apel- les, what work do you next propose to under- take?    RETURN TO PELLA.     223 "I have not yet entirely decided. I have several designs on hand, - among them one of a Venus, which is so far advanced, that it is ready to be colored. I wait only to find a model, whose complexion and color will satisfy my conception of the subject. It is, in point of composition and drawing, my happiest effort, and I am desirous of making its coloring correspond with the brilliant sub- ject." "Therein," said Alexander, "I think I can assist you. A highly accomplished maiden of Larissa, named Campaspe, has lately been ad- ded to the retinue of attendants upon Olym- pias. In beauty of form, brilliancy of com- plexion, and glowing color, she surpasses all that my eyes have ever beheld.  She shall serve you as a model, and earn for her single name all the fame which ten Grecian virgins shared among themselves, as models of the faultless Helen of Zeuxis. I know the loy- alty of the subject to whom I entrust her, and will confess to you that she has capti- vated my fancy; and, although she has not yet smiled upon me, I do not entirely de- spair of one day winning her favor. As a     224       APELLES. visitor to your mother and sister, she may with propriety remain under your roof as long as you require. Can you conveniently receive her?" "Your generosity enables me to entertain her with all the regard due to her station. The whole of the left wing of my house is at her service, and is ample for her and her attendants. If any thing is wanting, she has only to make her wishes known, and they shall be attended to." "I am all impatience to have you begin the picture. When can you receive her?" By the eighth hour of to-morrow, all shall be in readiness." "Ev7ye Apelles! Let us lose no time. Let us see if between us we cannot get up a miracle of art, the fame of which shall de- scend to future ages!" Apelles left the king in high spirits. Al- though deeply impressed by so strong a proof of his master's friendship and confidence, the artistical turn of his mind led him to look upon the distinguished guest he was about to receive, only as a fine model, who would enable him to transfer to his picture   RETURN TO PELLA..     225 his own favorite conceptions of grace and beauty. '4 I will make it bright, fresh, and sparkling as a May morning," said he to himself, as he bent his steps homeward. 15     -       CAMPASPE.

SAPPHO.   CHAPTER XVII. ON the morning of the expected arrival of the fair Larissean, the house of Apelles pre- sented a busy scene of active preparation. Ero- phile, the mother of the artist, came frequently to his library to consult him in relation to sundry matters which were again and again deferred by him to her more experienced judgment, until she informed him that nothing remained to be done. Zoe had, with her own hands, replen- ished the vases with fresh, glowing bouquets of flowers, and had disposed the musical instru- ments, and all the paraphernalia of feminine industry and accomplishments, in most pictu- resque and homelike order. She was evidently on the tiptoe of curiosity and expectation. She asked of her brother a thousand questions which he was unable to answer; and, for want of certain information, she had recourse to her imagination. "I hope she is not a spoiled beauty, haughty     230       APELLES. and arrogant, full of caprice and unreasona- ble fancies; if so, I shall lose all patience with her." "Nay, my dear sister," said Apelles, kindly; "that is not the way to prepare yourself for receiving her. Imagine her to be all that is lovely and charming, and your manners towards her will be sure to make her so. She will have but a dull time of it here, I fear; and you must do all in your power to amuse and divert her. We must all do our best, and trust to fortune for a happy result." At the appointed hour, Zoe rushed into the room, exclaiming, "She has come, dear brother, she has come! As I was seated at an upper window, I heard the lively sounds of a band of music; and, looking down the street, I saw a large procession of guards and attendants, and in their midst, the stately form of an elephant, bearing on his back a pavilion whose silken curtains concealed the forms of its fair inmates. His enormous sides were decorated with hous- ings of scarlet and gold, and the noble animal kept step in time with the music with an air of pride and pleasure. Hark! they are already at the door!"   CAMPASPE.       231 Apelles hastened to do the honors of the house to his visitor at the entrance. An officer of the guards had placed a ladder against the side of the sagacious animal, and, the curtains being withdrawn, a half dozen of young female attendants, with daintily pointed feet, nimbly descended to the street, like so many ballerine on the stage, and arranged themselves in two rows at the foot of the ladder. A large cloud of white muslin was next seen floating slowly and gracefully to the ground. Apelles extended his hand, which was silently accepted; and, making a low obeisance, he conducted Cam- paspe into the house. "Welcome to this dwelling," said he, as he conducted h-r through the atrium. "Let me present you to my good mother, who is anxious lest you should miss the luxuries of the palace under this humble roof." "Oh, no!" said the softest and sweetest of voices, beneath a close veil, which entirely con- cealed the speaker; "I am so fond of novelty and change! I am sure I shall soon be quite at home in this charming residence." He led her to a large reception room, where Erophile stood ready to receive her. On enter-     232       APELLES. ing, Campaspe threw off her ample veil, discov- ering to the eye of the painter a face of most exquisite and engaging beauty. The tender expression of her large Juno-like eyes was heightened by a silken fringe of long black eyelashes. A joyous smile displayed the beau- ties of a mouth which seemed too perfect for a mortal. The heart of the painter leaped with a strange and undefinable emotion, which, for an instant, made him unable to utter a word. "My mother!" said he, recollecting himself, as he approached Erophile. ,Slightly awed by the queenly bearing of her guest, the matron advanced a step, and, taking her hand, was about to kiss it; but this act of homage was not permitted by Campaspe; by a graceful motion of the arm, she placed the hand of her hostess close to her heart; and, re- spectfully kissing her forehead, gazed upon her face with an expression of intense pleasure and affection. The heart of Erophile was also taken by storm, and she gave utterance to her admi- ration, exclaiming, "Thrice blessed be the mother who gave birth to so much beauty and loveliness! Thou art altogether too fair, my   CAMPASPE.       233 child, to have been born of a daughter of man!" Zoe next approached, and was about to throw herself at the feet of the captivating beauty, who caught her in her arms, and, placing her hand under her chin, turned upwards her little mouth, which she kissed, saying, "What is your name?- Zoe? - I know I shall love you, Zoe, for I see that you have a merry and affectionate disposition." Observing that the attendants were in wait- ing, Erophile asked what disposition should be made of them. "Let them wait," said she; "I do not require their services at present." She then moved slowly about the room, examining the orna- ments and furniture with a childlike interest and curiosity. For a while, Apelles had a vague impression that he saw only a loose bale of perfumed muslin wafted by the wind over the soft Per- sian carpet. He would not have been sur- prised to see it rise upwards to the ceiling. He soon discovered, however, that it floated around an exquisite figure somewhat above the middle height. Her costume was not un-     234        APELLES. like that of the Cairene ladies of the present day, enveloping her person in ample folds down to her feet. Loose silken drawers, gathered at the bottom and confined to her ancle, gave to her steps the pretty effect of a stage-like march. She paused to examine a picture of Venus, around whose head a group of young Loves were sporting in the air. '"What darling little boys!" said she, admiringly. "Only look at this little fellow; his merriment is really infec- tious;" and she poured forth a stream of laugh- ter, in which all present heartily joined. "You give me a flattering proof that I have :been successful in the design of this picture," said Apelles. "Men usually bestow all their praises on the Venus alone; but a truly femi- nine instinct has enabled you to appreciate that which cost me the greatest labor. I did not give a smile to the goddess herself, because I wished to invest her with the majesty rather than the sensuous charms of beauty; and, in order to convey an idea of the joyous atmos- phere which surrounds her, I introduced this laughing Cupid." "May I kiss him?" asked she, with an ear- nest simplicity.   CAMPASPE.       235 '; By all means; I think he looks as if he were challenging you." Apelles could not help envying the work of his own hands, as, bending forward, she kissed it eagerly as if it were conscious of her ca- resses. "But I forget,5" said she to Erophile, "that I am occupying your time. Can I go to my apartment?" "Consider yourself at home, my love. This house and all that it contains are yours. Zoe shall conduct you." Gracefully saluting Apelles and his mother, Campaspe took the hand of Zoe, and, followed by her companions, she passed away from the vision of the painter like a fleeting dream. When the voices of the garrulous attendants, who followed Campaspe and Zoe, were lost in the distance, Apelles, smiling, asked,--"What say you, mother, of my fair model? You said she was too beautiful to have been born of woman; she looks as if she were a daughter of Mount Caucasus, which is said to produce the finest specimens of our race. Was there ever such a complexion?  Did you observe those little white spots in the centre of her damask     236       APELLES. cheeks, which came and went with the dimples of her smiles?" "She is utterly perfect in beauty," replied Erophile; "but that which attracted my admi- ration most was the winning simplicity of her manners. Her voice and enunciation are the most musical I ever heard. But I must leave thee, my son, and give orders that her repast be made ready." Instead of the haughty and capricious beauty whom Zoe had dreaded to encounter in the newly arrived guest, she found a gay and charming companion, who could not sufficiently express her thanks for the arrangements which had been made for her reception. "What sumptuous splendor!" said she, with unfeigned surprise, on entering a spacious and lofty sa- loon. Apelles had expended much time and no little money in the decoration of this room, in order to render it worthy of the honor of re. ceiving and entertaining his royal benefactor. The walls were hung with cloth of gold, divided into panels by heavy mouldings of burnished and richly chased silver. The centre of each panel was enlivened by a group of birds, fruit, and flowers, embroidered in silk; the rich bloom   CAMPASPE.       237 of the plum, the down of the peach, the dew- drops which bespangled the fresh, glowing flow- ers, and the vivid, variegated plumage of exotic birds, were all so brilliantly and harmoniously contrasted, that their coloring rivalled, without exceeding the truth of nature. A richly tessel- lated pavement shone like a mirror. The col- umns, architraves, and cornice were of a deli- cately veined, light-green marble. The couches and chairs were of white and gold, cushioned with scarlet velvet. The candelabra, vases, and ohler utensils were of massive silver of the choicest workmanship of Ephesus and Corinth. All the riches of color and material combined to produce an effect of gorgeous splendor, such as might gladden the heart even of a captive king. The light, which illumined the whole, stole through the leaves and flowers of choice vines which hung in festoons around the out- side of the windows, and imparted fragrance to the balmy air which pervaded the apart- ment. Campaspe was enthusiastic in the expression of her admiration, saying, "I shall never be dull or weary here, Zoe; I feel quite at home al- ready; but you must take up your abode with     238       APELLES. me; we shall be so happy! How long do you think your brother will want me?" "I have no idea," said Zoe. "Were I to paint your portrait, I would follow the example of Penelope, and undo at night the work of the day. I think I shall suggest the plan to Apelles." A sumptuous banquet was soon served, and the two damsels, seated opposite to each other, were waited upon by the young girls who ac- companied Campaspe. When their repast was finished, their con- versation was enlivened by music, songs, and dances, executed by the graceful and accom- plished attendants. Time flowed merrily on till a late hour of the night, when they retired to rest. On that night, Apelles, for the first time in his life, laid upon his pillow a head totally empty of artistic reflections or speculations. A bright vision floated before him in imagination; and if he thought of the picture he was to commence on the morrow, it was only because he rejoiced to think that it would enable him again to be- hold the form and listen to the musical voice of the fair Larissean.   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.     O Love, O Love, that through the eyes, Instillest softly warm desire, Pleased in the soul, with sweet surprise, Entrancing rapture to inspire; Never with wild, ungoverned sway Rush on my heart, and force it to obey; For not the lightning's fire, Nor stars swift darting through the sky, Equal the shafts sent by this son of Jove, When his hand gives them force to fly, Kindling the flames of love. EURIPIDES.   CHAPTER XVIII. IT is not our intention to reveal the mys- teries of the studio, nor to trace minutely the progress of the work on which Apelles was now employed.  The coloring of this picture, instead of proving a wearisome task, was a source of constant delight to the enthusiastic artist. His eyes sparkled with pleasure as he transferred to his own creation the glowing coloring and bewitching expressions which he found so fascinating in the original. It must be confessed, however, that the intense pleas- ure he experienced, was derived rather from the presence of his fair sitter, than from the artistic interest which usually engrossed him while painting. Excited by her beauty and amused by her gay and sprightly conversation, he wrought hour after hour, totally unconscious of the passage of time, until utter exhaustion 16     242       APELLES. of his energies warned him to end the labors of the day. Campaspe performed the duties of a model with equal alacrity and pleasure. She was attended by her maids, and by the mother and sister of Apelles. As she sat to the painter in one corner of the room, Erophile and Zoe, at a short distance, were engaged on works of tapestry or embroidery, while her attendants would, in the intervals of conver- sation, sing lively songs, accompanied by the lyre or lute. The time passed so agreeably, that when the labors of the painter were ended, Carnpaspe would frequently express her surprise in a tone of disappointment and regret. When she returned to her own apartments, she seemed to carry with her the sunshine of the day. The artist was alone in his studio, where a mournful silence succeeded the merry sounds of cheerful and musical voices. For hours he would sit listless and preoccupied. With half closed eyes he would recall her expressions and features during the rest of the day. At night, when sleep closed his wearied eyelids, glittering combinations of his   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.   243 roseate daydreams haunted his feverish imagi- nation. In a word, he was deeply in love. He rejoiced in secret that he loved L"a bright, particular star," which was shedding a mild and benignant ray over his whole existence. The varied impression, which the beauty of Campaspe had at first sight made on his imagination, had become a passion which took full possession of all his intellectual and physical faculties. He never asked whether he was beloved; the boon of loving in secret was all he desired; but it was not long be- fore the pleasing conviction that he was far from indifferent to her, dawned upon him; a thousand little acts, tones, and expressions convinced him, that she had divined his pas- sion, and that she was by no means displeased or offended by it. Such was the state of his mind as he sat, one happy morning, intensely occupied in the work before him. There was a pause in the conversation. Pleased with his success, and smiling as he occasionally raised his eyes to the face of his lovely and silent sitter, he ob- served with rapture, that he was answered by a languid smile, expressive of the tenderest     244       APELLES. sympathy and compassion. Fixing an earnest gaze upon her large, dark, and unconscious eye, it seemed to him that her whole soul was streaming forth, meeting, mingling, and uniting with his own. A vivid blush and downcast glance revealed to him, that at that moment, for the first time, she began to be conscious of her own feelings. In the delirium of his transport, he forgot all but the present moment; casting a hasty look around, to ascertain that they were not observed, he was on the point of wafting a kiss from the tips of his fingers, when --she suddenly started, with a slight shriek, and seizing her veil, threw it hastily over her per- son, and sank backwards into her chair. Had she divined his intention, and been alarmed or shocked by his presumption? or had something unexpectedly occurred to startle her in so singular a manner? Turning in the direction of her hurried glance, he beheld, in the open doorway behind him, the silent form of Alexander, standing motionless upon the threshold, with features darkened by a lowering and unwonted ex- pression.   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.   245 ": Pardon me, O king," said Apelles; "I was so preoccupied that I did not hear you knock." ' I did not knllock,"' said Alexander, some- what abruptly. "I was absent-minded, and Apelles will pardon my abstraction. But, look to Campaspe, for she seems to have fainted." Zoe and the young attendants were instantly at her side, fanning her and chafing the palms of tier hands. Her recovery was soon made evident by her bursting into a hysterical fit of laughter. "It was very absurd of me to have been so easily frightened; but when I saw you stand- ing, statue-lilie, without uttering a word, I thought I beheld a phantom." "I fear," said Apelles, "I have overtasked your kindness, and have fatigued you by too long a sitting." "It is but a passing indisposition," replied the gentle damsel; "but if you will dispense with my services, I will retire awhile to my own apartment." So saying, she made an obeisance to the king, who was closely examining the picture, and, followed by her wormen, left the studio, be- stowing upon ADelles a glance so full of ten-     246       APELLES. derness, that he started in terror lest Alexander should have observed it. "She will soon be better," said Alexander, dryly. "The air of your room must be close, Apelles, for your own face glows as if you had been engaged in culinary operations in- stead of artistic labors." "I have overtasked my powers, I believe," said Apelles, fanning himself;" but my labors are ended for the day." "Evye, O Apelles! well done, my friend," said the king, admiring the picture more leis- urely. "This is to be our best picture, for I consider that I have contributed something towards its beauty. But you must not hurry its execution. Campaspe shall remain with you as long as you wish." Apelles felt, by a sort of magnetic in- stinct, that the eye of Alexander was fixed upon him with a peculiarly searching and significant expression, which he dared not to encounter; he therefore made a show of col- lecting his pencils and painting materials, as he stammered forth his thanks and acknowl- edgments. "You must know, my friend," said Alex-   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.   247 ander, seating himself by the side of the painter, "that I have been for several days in a state of Mnental exaltation. This must ac- count for my unexpected appearance here, which nearly frightened poor Campaspe out of her wits. I have formed a design, which I am anxious to have carried out during my projected expedition into Asia. It is that of founding a noble library, in which to preserve all that is valuable in history, science, poetry, and the arts. Such an institution for the in- crease and diffusion of knowledge, will be the surest means of extending the civilization of Greece into the countries which I propose to subjugate. Thus I shall convert hostile bar- barians into faithful allies and valuable friends. What say you to my plan?" "That is a most brilliant conception, and fully worthy of your enterprising genius. Where do you propose to place it?"  "In Alexandria, -that is to say, in a new capital, yet to be founded and called by my own name. You perceive, my friend, that the thing is somewhat in a state of embryo, but some steps have already been taken towards its development. I have written to Aristotle,     248       APELLES. to prepare for me, with the aid of others, a full catalogue of all the best works which can be obtained. I have ordered plans for a build- ing of ample size, and in a style commensu- rate with the dignity and importance of its destination. When I reflect upon the ad- vances which Greece has made in art and learning within three centuries, I long to in- crease them, and to extend their happy influ- ences as far as possible. With regard to works of art, I count upon your cooperation with me, to select and procure all that is valuable. Your knowledge of what has been done in that direction, will enable you easily to make a list of everything worth preserving; but you, who have carried the art to the highest point of perfection, owe it to posterity to leave a record of your knowledge, that it, may not die with you. Do you think of the task as a congenial one?" "The subject has occupied my mind much of late," said Apelles. "During my residence in Athens I had frequent conversation with Aristotle upon the subject, and received from him both encouragement and many valuable suggestions. I had already divided my work   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.   249 into three heads: first, the history of painting, which should convey not only an accurate account of its progress, but the characteristics, excellences, and defects of the several schools; second, the theory of the art, explaining the principles which should regulate it; and lastly, the practice of painting, which should embody all that exists of traditionary knowledge, to- gether with such additions and inventions as my own practice and experience have dis- covered. It is only within the last century that painting has been fully developed as an art. By the application of the laws of sym- metry to composition, as well as the organiza- tion of the human figure, painting, which was previously little more than a sleight-of-hand ac- complishment, has been erected into an or- ganized art, bound by laws equally strict, and not dissimilar from those which regulate the creations of poetry, music, and architecture. Your wishes are a command, and I shall cheerfully devote a portion of every day to the execution of the plan." "I am not sure that I fully understand what you mean by the laws of symmetry," said Alexander, with an expression of interest.     250       APELLES. "I use the word in a sense purely techni- cal," replied Apelles. "The word 'v//eTplia Symmetry, which implies the having a com- mon measure, has lost somewhat of its original significance. Artistically speaking, a face or a figure is symmetrical only when it is so propor- tioned, that every feature or member is divided into aliquot parts,-- that is to say, when they all have a common measure. You are aware, that Pythagoras brought from Egypt an arith- metical key of the proportions of the human figure, which, although of a rude character, was communicated to artists, by whom it was developed, and gave rise to those perfect canons of art, which gradually raised Grecian sculpture to its present perfection."  "Do I understand you to say, that you have rules establishing the length and breadth of every feature or member of the body? If so, I cannot account for the variety of forms which the chisel and pencil constantly produce. The combinations of beautiful forms differing in character, are infinite, and would seem to require not one canon, but an infinity of canons." , See Note 2.   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.    251 4 So it would appear to a hasty observer; but I can easily convince you of the con- trary, if you care to listen to such abstruse speculations." "Proceed, I beg of you, for I am equally surprised and interested by what you say." "I know  of nothing presenting a greater variety of form than a collection of eggs, of which it is impossible to find any two exactly alike. Please observe this diagram, which I have prepared to explain to my pupils this very subject. You perceive, that it represents a number of egg-like forms, no two of which are alike. This dissimilitude is not produced by the skill of an accurate hand, but by rigid adherence to a general law. The lead- ing form is that of an oval, whose transverse axis is raised somewhat above the centre of the perpendicular axis. In these specimens the axes of all are of precisely the same di- mensions, but the variety of forms arises from the different degrees of elevation of the trans- verse axis above the oval centre. The point of intersection once given, the curve uniting the extremities is fixed by simple mathematical laws, and a pleasing variety of forms results.     25)2       APELLES. In the same way the laws of the human figure are of a general character, giving free scope to taste and genius in the delineation of variety, character, and expression in details. So much for the design of individual figures. A broader application of the same principles to composition produces that musical harmony, which is so essential to a work of art. If it be objected, that such a system reduces the art to an act of mere mechanical accuracy, it must be borne in mind, that the poet is bound by the rules of prosody, the musician by the concord of sounds, and the architect by established laws of proportion. An adher- ence to these laws proves not a fetter to tram- mel invention, but an invaluable instrument to heighten effect and give unspeakable pleasure. The stately march of Homer's lines, instead of lessening the beauty of his language, gives ad- ditional force and expression to each word. The painter who neglects these rules, is like the poet who is guilty of false quantities. He has lost a beauty, the absence of which the uninitiated may not be able to point out, but they feel it. The eye is as sensibly alive to harmony of form and proportions, as is the   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.    253 ear to that of sound.- It is a great mistake to suppose, that the pleasure we derive from the contemplation of works of art, arises solely from our physical and intellectual sympathies with the objects represented. Unless these be heightened by an all pervading melody and harmony, the work cannot lay claim to the dignity of art. To illustrate more fully my meaning, I beg you to observe this compli- cated combination of lines,* which have no physical interest or attraction, yet the eye experiences an exquisite pleasure as it follows the intricate yet regular mazes, and the variety of forms included between them." "And is it for the paltry sum of one talent," asked the king, enthusiastically, "that you reveal to your pupils all these mysteries?" "Certainly! knowledge is like fire, which can be imparted to others without impoverish- ing the giver. In the same way, by education, you convert common soldiers into captains and generals, who render you greater service than ten times the amount of their mere brute force. The artist who conceals his knowledge * A combination of lines known to the moderns as an ara- besque.     254        APELLES. from others degrades his art into a niggardly and mercenary trade." '"I no longer wonder at your enthusiasm for your noble art. Were I not Alexander, I , would be Apelles." '"Apelles had not been Apelles without thle aid of the royal house of Macedon," said the artist, sincerely returning the complime-nt. Before closing this chapter, let us pause and regret that the treatise upon painting, which Apelles is known to have written, has been lost to the world. If, as is quite prob- able, a copy of it was deposited in the library subsequently founded by Alexander in Egypt, it is by no means certain, that it is irretriev- ably lost. The accounts of the conflagration of this building, so much lamented by all scholars and critics, are contradictory; some writers speaking of it as a partial damage only, and others as a total destruction. In the former case, the remains of many treasures may now be lying neglected under the ac- cumulated sands and rubbish of ages. In the year 1847, Mr. Joseph Arden, an English gentleman, while travelling in Egypt, purchased from an Arab Sheik a quantity of old papyri   AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.    255 and rubbish, which had been turned up in some recent excavations.  On returning to England and examining carefully, he discov- ered portions of two lost orations of Hyper- eides, fifteen consecutive pages of one, and an- other-that for Euxinippus nearly intact. In a beautiful folio edition, he presented the text by a colored fac-simile on one page, and by the modern type on the opposite. Singularly enough, the motto of the title-page was a quo- tation in Latin friom the commentaries of an old German scholar, as follows: -- "'Non prorsus videtur spes abjicienda, fore ut Hyperidis orationes aliquando ex situ et tenebris in lucem protrahantur. a KIESLING." Let us conclude, therefore, by expressing a hope and belief that the lost treatise of Apelles imay yet be brought to light!     4 r \   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE. 17     What have I done, unhappy as I am, And whither wandered from my sober sense?

ON the departure of Alexander, Apelles men- tally reviewed the events of the morning. Re- morse, shame, and confusion filled his mind, as he reflected that he had been on the point of committing, before the eyes of his royal bene- factor, an act which would have forfeited his esteem forever. He would have proved to one who had reposed in him the most generous con- fidence, that he was totally unworthy of it. He looked upon the state of mind, which had for a moment banished from his breast every feeling of loyalty, gratitude, and honor, as an infatua- tion, not only inexcusable, but unaccountable. "Insensate that I was!" exclaimed he, "so soon to forget the gentle but significant caution which he gave me when he sent hither the apple of his eye. 'I know the loyalty of thIy nature,' he said; and these words alone should have sur- rounded my heart with a triple case of steel. By a miracle I have been preserved from dishonor     260       APELLES. and infamy. The treachery I meditated is known to no one but myself; but the insane im- pulse shall soon be effaced from my memory. I will banish her from my thoughts; fromn this moment she shall be to me as a block of mar- ble; I will behold her not with indifference only, but with fear and horror, as if she were a Me- dusa." By the severity of his self-reproaches, he endeavored to atone to himself for his past indiscretion, and vowed to submit to every mortification and penance which his ingenuity could devise. "It will be a pleasure to assume an indif- ference of manner, and to observe her surprise at my -altered bearing, for by so doing I shall make amends for the folly which came so near proving my destruction. The pleasure she evinces in my company is only a striking ex- ample of that inconsistency of woman's nature which fondly dreams of basking in the light and warmth of love's flame, without exposure to danger from its scorching fires. Woman is a cruel angler, totally unmindful of the pangs and tortures of the heart which she finds pleasure in captivating! The experiences of this day have taught me a lesson which shall not be soon forgotten." S   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE. 2G1 With resolutions of this character, he repaired to his studio On the following morning. Catm- paspe soon made her appearance, bright and blooming as ever. The gay tones of her voice, as she commenced a sprightly conversation, caused the painter's heart to palpitate with a momentary joy; but by careful attention to his work, he was soon able to master his emotions. He listened without making any remarks, and she naturally attributed his silence to absence of mind. After an hour or two, Apelles was aware that his hands were working without the guid- ance of his head; and, with a look of vexa- tion, he wiped away the whole of his morning's work. "I fear," said Campaspe, " that my conver- sation distracts your attention, and disturbs you while at work." The curt coldness of the reply which he made with averted eyes was so marked that the stu- dious change of his manner became sufficiently evident. Campaspe at first looked surprised, then pensive and dejected. She made a few timid attempts to renew conversation, but in vain, and finally rose, saying,--     262       APELLES. "I fear I have not entirely recovered from the indisposition of yesterday, and, with your permission, will return to my apartment." As she left the room, Apelles observed that she kept up a forced conversation with her women, without bestowing upon him so much as a parting look. "Why, what is the matter with you, brother?" asked Zoe, eagerly; " are you not well, to-day?" "My work has made little or no progress this morning; it is not a day of inspiration. But leave me, my love, for I am in no very pleasant humor." As soon as he was alone, the unhappy lover threw himself on the ground, where he lay writhing like a maniac under the tortures of conflicting emotions and passions. In his bosom raged a war between hostile forces. On the one side, love, fanned by all the ten- derest sympathies and captivating images; on the other, friendship, honor, and virtue. The contest was long and fierce; a flood of tears at last came to his relief, and his frenzied tortures were succeeded by the calmness of despair. For the first time of his artist-life, Apelles passed the day without drawing a line! He   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE. 263 felt utterly incapable of paying attention to anything requiring thought or study. He re- mained communing with his own thoughts until the shades of evening began to darken his studio. Arousing from his lethargy, he re- paired to the supper-room, where he found his mother anxiously expecting him. Her affec- tionate greeting fell like a balm upon his wounded spirit. Pouring out a large goblet of wine, he kissed her as he said, "Health to thee, mother,--my best, my kindest, my only friend!" "Thy best and truest friend, my son, but not thine only friend," said Erophile, somewhat startled by something unusual in his manner. "I know no one who can boast such hosts of well-wishers; and surely, the friendship of Alex- ander is not to be reckoned as naught." "True, mother, I should be ungrateful to for- get it. It was only yesterday that he bade me not to be in haste to finish my picture, saying that Campaspe should remain as long as I required her. Could he have given a stronger proof of his generous confidence?" "I know not," said Erophile, "whether to consider this as a mark of his friendship, alto-     264       APELLES. gether. It may be that he is indifferent to her charms. It is rumored abroad that 'he is deeply in love with the beauty, but I cannot believe in the warmth of a flame which is unattended by the sparks of jealousy." This casual remark, falling from the lips of his mother, instantly wrought a total revolution in the mind of Apelles. The gloomy clouds of doubt and remorse were dispelled like vapors before the rising sun of hope. He might still love without wronging his friend. He might still bask in the sunshine of her smiles without intimating to her the bliss which he experi- enced. He would deny himself only the pleas- ure of giving expression to his passion excepting by his looks and actions. "Give me light," said he, "for I would be merry to-night." The domestic in waiting lighted lamps and candelabras one after another, until the room was brilliantly illuminated. Apelles had just dismissed the servant, say- ing that he required no further service, when the merry voices of Zoe and Campaspe were heard approaching. The door was opened, and the smiling Larissean stood by the side of Zoe on the threshold.   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE. 265 "You perceive, my good Erophile, that I am taking full advantage of your hospitable in- junction to make myself at home here. I begin to tire of the dainty banquets with which you load my table. Your simple fare is more attractive to me at present, and I have come to share it with you." "And do you not perceive," said Apelles, in a very different tone from that which he had assumed in the morning, "that a presentiment of this coming honor has prompted me to pre- pare an illumination?" "How bright and cheerful it is, and how nice and appetizing everything looks!" said Cam- paspe, as she gracefully took a place next to Erophile. This remark was accompanied by a smile, which said plainly to Apelles, "All is forgotten; let us be happy again." As the sunshine is doubly welcome after a lowering storm, so the happiness of the evening derived a zest from the recollection of the sor- rows and grief of the morning. It seemed to Apelles that the merry conversation and spark- ling sallies of wit which bubbled forth from the lips of Campaspe had arrested the progress of old Time, who stood still and lingered a     266           APELLES. smiling  listener.  At the   hour of   midnight, dreading to lose his visitor, he took from the wall  an  ancient  lyre which   he  handed   to Zoe. "Give me a song, Zoe.     This lyre, made by the hand of old Terpander of Lesbos, is a fit- ting instrument to accompany the words of the Lesbian muse. Sing for us that favorite song of Sappho." The brilliant tones of Zoe's voice were height- ened by contrast with the rich and mellow sounds of the old instrument, as she sung,-- Blest as the immortal gods is he, The youth who fondly sits by thee, And hears and sees thee all the while Softly speak and sweetly smile. 'Twas this deprived my soul of rest, And raised such tumults in my breast; For, while I gazed in tempests tossed, My breath was gone, my voice was lost. My bosom glowed; a subtle flame Ran quick through all my vital frame; O'er my dim eyes a darkness hung; My ears with hollow murmurs rung. In dewy damps my limbs were chilled; My blood with gentle horrors thrilled; My feeble pulse forgot to play, I fainted, sunk, and died away.   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE.   267 "I never hear that exquisite  song," said Apelles, "'without admiration  and wonder; how could a woman have divined the pas- sions and feelings which are peculiar to the breast of man?' "I have a song," said Campaspe, " which is the very counterpart of Sappho's. It is a poem by a barbarian king of the olden time, who puts into the mouth of his mistress the praises of his own person. I think it is as remarkable a specimen of feminine tenderness as Sappho's is of manly fire and passion.  I allude only to the sentiment and images of the original, which I was obliged to translate. I am no poetess, and you must not expect the language of Sap- pho." Taking the lyre, and gracefully running her dainty fingers over the strings, after a pre- lude of a few mellow and liquid notes, she sung as follows: - "The moon was shining bright on high Above King David's tower, And streaming through the green vine leaves That roofed my garden bower. "Sleep closed mine eyelids, but mine ears Were by a voice beguiled, ' Oh, let me in, my sister, love, My dove, mine undefiled.     268           APELLES. "'For I am cold and wet with dew, My locks are dropping rain; My mantle I have left behind, My feet how shall I stain?' "My love then placed his hand within The opening by the door; My soul was moved to pity him, My heart was stricken sore. "I rose. With fingers dripping myrrh, Sweet smelling myrrh alone, I drew the bolt and opened wide, But lo! my love was gone. "My heart had failed me when he spake; I called--he answered not; I sought him in the public ways And each secluded spot. "The watchmen of the city heard My loud and frantic wail; They seized, they smote, they wounded me, And rent away my veil. "I charge ye, Zion's daughters all, That wheresoe'er ye rove, Ye seek my love, and say to- him That I am sick of love. L"'How shall ye know my love from those Whom other maidens claim? ' Among ten thousand he is chief; I need not speak his name. "For, as a cedar he is tall; His cheeks are white and red,   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE.     269 And flowing locks of raven hair Adorn his comely head. "His mouth is like a bed of spice, His smile is passing sweet, His eyes like dove's eyes, washed with milk, And beautifully set. "Let this true picture of my love Your souls with pity move To find my love, and say to him That I am sick of love." The tender pathos of this poem gained addi- tional force from the graceful and natural man- her of its delivery by the fair songstress. The varied intonations of her musical voice, and the changing expression of her lovely features, were so true to nature that, to the rapt painter, she seemed to be pouring forth the thoughts and feelings of her own overflowing soul. When she described the personal attributes of the beloved, her dark eyes flashed with an ex- ultation of triumphant joy which, in the last verse, faded into an expression of languid ex- haustion. "Exquisite!" said  Apelles, whose suffused eyes bore testimony to the sincerity of his praise. 4 How   would the heart of old   Ter- pander have dilated to have heard such sounds     270       APELLES. coming from  his instrument? There is a quaintness of language which gives a pictu- resque grace to the simplicity of the style." "I had a prose translation from a traveller who, in his youth, had made several trading voyages with the Phoenicians, and devoted him- self to the study of the language, the history, and letters of the countries he visted. I was so much pleased with its images, that I amused myself by making a metrical version. The poem is remarkable, as coming from a king who, in his person, united the characters of priest and sovereign. His history is peculiar; since, reversing the usual order of life, he was in his youth a devoted student of wisdom and philosophy, and in his old age a voluptuary. His love songs have been handed down among the sacred writings and historical records of his religion; and the belief of the learned of that religion has strangely enough invested them with a sacred character. It is even pre- tended that their amatory images are typical and prophetic of important coming events." "I shrewdly suspect," said Apelles, "that the vouth of the poet was not exclusively devoted to piety and learning. Those lines are too full   A STORM, SUCCEEDED BY SUNSHNE. 271 of youthful freshness and tenderness to have been penned by an aged voluptuary." Apologizing for the length of her visit, Cam- paspe respectfully kissed her matron hostess, and, bidding Apelles a cheerful good-night, re- tired with Zoe to her own apartment. The sage Erophile, before retiring, whispered to her son a word of caution. "Beware of those bright eyes, my son; for, unless I am greatly mistaken, she loves thee." "The partiality of a mother's eyes has warped your usually sagacious judgment," re- plied Apelles, whose exulting heart gave the lie to the words which came from his lips.     l   THE INSPIRATION OF A WOMAN'S HEART. 18     "Thou art not dead, my brother, though no more A sojourner on earth's tempestuous shore; Fled to the peaceful islands of the blest, Where Youth and Love, forever beaming, rest; Or joyful wandering o'er Elysian ground, Among sweet flowers, where not a thorn is found! No winter freezes there, no summer fires, No sickness weakens, and no labor tires; No longer poverty nor thirst oppress, No envy of man's boasted happiness; But spring forever glows serenely bright, And bliss immortal hails the heavenly light!  UNCERTAIN GREEK AUTHOR. -   CHAPTER XX. AT the next sitting, Apelles continually re- peated to himself two significant remarks made by his mother on the previous evening, -" 1 cannot believe in the warmth of a flame which is unattended by the sparks of jealousy," and, "Unless I am greatly mistaken, she loves thee." He longed to get some clue as to the state of feeling of his fair sitter towards Alexander, who had so frankly confessed his admiration. By a natural turn of the conversation, he spoke in glowing terms of the noble, generous character and brilliant achievements of the young military monarch. "I envy not the laurels of a conqueror," said Campaspe; "they spring from the blood of human victims, and are watered by the tears of widows and orphans. War seems to me a cruel, unnatural, and unholy trade. Its instru- ments, the soldiery, are brutally unhuman-     276       APELLES. ized. Justice, pity, and mercy are banished from their breasts; and, in their stead, hate, revenge, and lawless passions rage with relent- less fury." "You speak feelingly," said Apelles. "Alas! I have too much reason.  In my early youth I received an impression never to be effaced." She shuddered,--paused a mo- ment, and with a deep sigh resumed,- "About four years ago, (I was then sixteen years of age,) I was seated in my father's garden, near Larissa. My little brother, only nine years old, was at my side, listening to some stories, which I was relating for his amusement. He was remarkable for his intel- ligence, affectionate disposition, and endearing manners. I loved him like a mother. The stories were of my own invention, for I took a singular delight in exciting by turns his wonder, his apprehensions and sympathy, and then-by some happy and unexpected acci- dent, to merge all those feelings in one of perfect satisfaction and delight. I would watch his breath growing short and quick, as some danger threatened, or at the narration of some deed of injustice. But when at the end,   THE INSPIRATION OF A WOMAN'S HEART. 2" poetical justice crowned the virtuous with success and happiness, with a sigh of relief and content his chest would expand, his eyes sparkle with delight, and a sweet kiss would be given to me as the good, genius who had brought it all about. "The period of which I am speaking, was at the termination of one of King Philip's most brilliant campaigns. He had returned in triumph to Pella, with such of his army as remained with him on the battle-field. Large numbers, however, had in the conflict been separated from the main body, and dispersed through the country. They sought their way home, plundering, robbing, and committing acts of the most atrocious violence. L"My father had been summoned to Larissa on important business, and advised me to re- main in the house, remarking, that at present it was dangerous to be abroad. The day was fine. The garden looked so peaceful and smiling, that I could not imagine any danger there, and I yielded to my brother's importun- ities to repose under the shade of a bower, which afforded a cool and fragrant retreat. As I was watching his pleased expression at     278       APELLES. the happy termination of a long story, I ob- served that he suddenly started, and his cheeks were blanched with fear. c On looking up, I saw three common sol- diers, who, by their ragged attire and squalid countenances, evidently formed a part of the straggling band of the Macedonian army, who were to be dreaded more than our barbarian enemies. "c Come with us, fair lady,' said one of them, 'and no harm shall befall you.' I uttered a violent shriek,--for in their faces I read the character of brutes and not of men. I was seized--my mouth was stopped by a rude hand, to prevent a renewal of my cries. My brother, with a courage and strength be- yond his years, grasped a stick, which had served him as a mimic horse, and struck the wretch who was holding me, with such force as to bring blood, and cause him to release his hold. "Ye gods!" she exclaimed, hiding her face in her hands, "why do I still see with these eyes, which beheld him butchered, like a lamb in the shambles? In vain I tore my hair and sued for mercy to his innocent years. I might   THE INSPIRATION OF A WOMAN'S HEART. 279 have sooner moved the heart of a roaring lion or a pack of famished wolves. I called upon the sun in the blue heavens above, and asked if such things could be. It turned black in my sight. My brain failed me, and I fell senseless to the earth." Here she paused a moment, as if unable to proceed. Apelles waited with silent and breath- less interest, until the violence of her emotions had subsided, when, wiping her eyes she re- sumed, - "On my return to consciousness, new scenes of horror met my eyes.  My cries had been heard by some of my father's peasants, who, rushing upon the soldiers with clubs, scythesj and pitchforks, felled them to the ground, and after despatching them, severed their heads and limbs from  their bodies. I saw only a heap of carnage. "I turned towards my brother. Death had set his violet seal upon his tender eyelids and upon his lips. His little form lay like a sleep- ing statue of marble on the fresh green sod. The hand, which had been so lately clenched and raised in my defence, hung by his side as peacefully and gracefully, as if he were slumber-     280       APELLES. ing on his mother's bosom. I kissed the wound in his side, whence his sweet spirit had winged its way to the peaceful realms above. In the bitterness of my anguish, I cursed the god of war as an evil demon, and not one of the con- clave of high Olympus. From that moment, the sight of arms fills me with horror and loath- ing. In the stately march and pomp of mili- tary bodies, I see only the cruel and stealthy tread of beasts of prey, and the sound of mar- tial music falls upon mine ear like the baying of bloody-mouthed hounds, insatiate in their thirst for slaughter." - Tears, the overflowings of a heart of the keenest sensibility, for a moment blinded the eyes of Apelles. On looking up he saw that they were grateful to the narrator, who be- stowed upon him  a sweet smile of sym- pathy as she continued:-- "Were I a man, I would devote my life to an endeavor to develop and disseminate the sentiments, which are now feebly struggling in my woman's breast. I would pray to the gods to grant me eloquence, -in order that persuasion should wait upon my words. I would teach men, that this body, which we   THE INSPIRATION OF A WOMAN'S HEART. 281 of the Grecian faith worship as the incarna- tion of the beautiful, is but the earthly and perishable habitation of a divine and immor- tal spirit, and that it should be held in sub- jection to the spirit. I would teach them to beware of the passions and infirmities with which the mortal body seeks to stain and de- grade the divine part of man. What can be more lovely than the pure, confiding, and in- nocent mind of a child? The proud, the am- bitious, and the cruel are attracted by it, and are awed by the majesty of purity. If above the gods we worship, there be a Supreme Creator and Ruling Divinity, he must be surrounded by clouds of children, who nestle in the bosom of his mantle, or sport lovingly around his hoary head. I would teach men to remain children in heart; to return good for evil; to seek justice and love mercy; to love our fellow-creatures as ourselves; and, even in the most degraded of mankind, to re- cognize an immortal being, who, however sullied by vice or error, may, by kindness and love, be won over to the dignity of virtue and the enjoyment of happiness." "Spoken like a  true woman," said Apelles;     282       APELLES. "but I fear that the man who should venture to express ideas so contrary. to our received opinions, would make but few proselytes. He would, in fact, run no small risk of meet- ing with hostile opposition, if not with the loss of his life." "Willingly would I lay down mine own, if by so doing I could impart to others the serene happiness which arises in my bosom from a full conviction of the truth and worth of these views." "Be satisfied," said Apelles, with enthusiasm, "in having convinced me. From this moment, I will strive to be a child in heart." Thus ended a conversation, which left both speakers in a frame of mind, which, had they lived four centuries later, would have led them both to embrace and profess the doctrines of Christianity.   THE ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS.     Thus silver Cynthia's milder glories rise, To glad the pale dominion of the skies. Her lovely cheeks a pure vermilion shed, Like roses beautifully streaked with red. A flowery mead her well-turned limbs disclose, Fraught with the blushing beauties of the rose; But when she moved, in radiant mantle drest, Flowers half unveiled adorned her flowing vest, And numerous graces wantoned on her breast. The wondering crowds the radiant nymph admire, And every bosom kindles with desire: Where'er she turns, their eyes, their thoughts pursue, They sigh, and send their souls at every view. MUSIEUS.   CHAPTER XXI THE left wing of Apelles's house, occupied by Campaspe and her attendants, communi- cated with that on the right, by a passage through a triclinium, or dining-room, in a building, which, as has been before stated, joined the two wings and formed the division between the two peristyles. This triclinium was lighted by a window opening upon the upper peristyle, used by the family of Apelles. The lower one was entered only from the apartments of Campaspe, so that she was en- abled to maintain a state of privacy, as com- plete as if she were lodged in her own apart- ments at the king's palace. This seraglio-like seclusion failed not to ex- cite the curiosity and imagination of the two neophytes in the worship of the beautiful, -the pupils of Apelles. They thought of their     286       APELLES. master as a high-priest of art, admitted to the presence of a divinity, whom they were con- demned to worship in an outer temple. The ardent and youthful imagination of Euphorus was busy in framing pictures with ever vary- ing details, and his vivid and poetical sketches of his day-dreams gradually excited the slow temperament of Xylon to nearly the same de- gree of fervor. "What say you, O studious Xylon, to the fact, that we are now housed under the same roof with the most beautiful woman in the world? It must be so, for it is whispered that she has conquered the heart of Alexander the Conqueror. What regal splendor of attire and charming grace of address must go together to heighten the attractions of a faultless per- son! This is her wonted hour for sitting to Apelles. Methinks I hear the rustling of her voluminous robes, sweeping along the corridor connecting her apartments with our master's studio, her steps falling like snow-flakes on the marble pavement, unheard but for the musical click and ring of the golden clasps which bind to her lily-white feet the scarlet lacings of her sandals. Grant me, ye gods,   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 287 one moment's sight of so much loveliness, and I will die with pleasure and content." "You are like a spoiled child, who cries to possess the moon," said Xylon, sedately; "to sigh for that which is unattainable, is fruit- less." "And you, my friend, are most painfully didactic. I leave you to philosophize, and will betake myself to the garden, where I can dream on, undisturbed by your most uncon- genial wisdom." "What folly! what waste of time!" mur- mured the elder student, when he found him- self alone. "Euphorus has talents, nay, a brilliant genius, which might work miracles, if he could but acquire a little self-control. He has an eloquent tongue, however, and I often regret to silence his rhapsodies by words of timely caution." The mind of Xylon was slow, timid, and cautious, but appreciative in the highest de- gree. Wit was to him an impossibility, but he had the keenest perception of it, and would analyze, with wonderful accuracy, the happy creations of others. He was now amplifying and dilating upon the images suggested to his     288       APELLES. imagination by his young friend, when the latter entered the room with a bound, his Eyes sparkling with joy, and his step elastic with pleasure and animation. "Now then," said he, "I am ready to die, for the gods have granted my prayer. I have had the full moon in these hands, to use your own figure of speech. I have seen her." "Seen whom?"  asked the imperturbable Xylon. "I have seen the goddess, - nay, three god- desses in one. I have seen the peerless Cam- paspe - the Rose of Larissa." "Impossible!" exclaimed the incredulous Xylon, dropping his pencil in utter amazement. "Listen, my friend, and enjoy from my lips a sight, which a faint heart and timid councils can never earn for your eyes. As I was strolling through the garden, I naturally raised my eyes to the lofty window of Apelles's studio. I envied Apollo, whose rays were making their way into the forbidden precinct, when my attention was attracted to a tall plum-tree, directly opposite the window. In the upper branches hung the effigy of a man made of old clothes, stuffed with straw,   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 289 and placed there to scare away the birds. He was precisely in the position I wished to oc- cupy. So I transferred my envy from Apollo to the man of straw. The gods inspired me with courage to climb, and placing myself exactly behind the scarecrow, I was enabled to obtain an unobstructed view of the interior of the studio and-its inmates!" ' How was she attired?" asked Xylon, who began to be interested. "My attention was too much attracted by the exquisite beauty of her face, her bare arm and hand, to observe her apparel. As I gazed on those lovely features, methought I beheld a vision such as must have haunted the dreams of Paris, uniting the beauties of the three goddesses who, on Mount Ida, contended for the golden prize. I saw the majesty of Hera. the accomplishments of Athena, and the bewitching grace of Cytherea. Around her, stood three lovely maidens, arranging the folds of her drapery. As she held out her arm to receive a bracelet from one of them, she looked like Cytherea, adorned by the Graces! My poetical imagination soon suggested to me, that, like Actaeon, I was an intruder, and 19     290       APELLES. not wishing to share his fate and be devoured by a pack of hounds, I gently and noiselessly dropped to the ground; and here I am, hap- piest of the happy!" "Thank your star that you are here safe, and not dangling by the neck in the tree, which would most assuredly have been your fate had you been seen. There you would have hung until your flesh had been picked from your bones by vultures. Alexander is terrible in his wrath, and summary in his punishments. At this moment I cannot think of the risk you have run, without trembling." The confident and reckless Euphorus replied only by a loud laugh, to the foreboding words of his gloomy friend, as they left the studio together. On the following morning, Xylon was punct- ually seated, and assiduously at work on his picture. Euphorus had not yet arrived. In fact, he was generally tardy in his attendance. Any passing show, or a chance meeting with a gay and amusing companion, was always sufficient to delay him an hour or two be- yond the appointed time of study. Having no one to converse with, Xylon naturally re-   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 291 volved in his mind the conversation of yester- day, and in spite of the reproof which he had administered to his friend's rashness, he could not but admire his adroitness, and secretly envied him his success. By slow degrees it occurred to him, that he might achieve the same feat, if he had the courage to attempt it. "After all," said he, " it is no such difficult matter; I can use the scarecrow as a screen, as well as Euphorus.  But-if I should be discovered!" Suddenly a bright thought occurred to him. "Even in that case, shall I not be' believed when I shall say, that I mounted the tree to pick a plum or two?  Come on, O Xylon, and show thyself a man. Euphorus shall no longer taunt thee with a want of courage!" So saying, he crept stealthily into the gar- den, and after ascertaining that he was not observed, made directly for the plum-tree. On attempting to mount, however, he found the feat less easy than it had seemed from Euphorus's description. Possessing neither the courage nor the agility of his friend, he made but an awkward business of it; and in his endeavoring to ascend in safety to the upper     292       APELLES. branches, he lost sight of his object, to get behind the scarecrow; in fact, he was most imprudently standing side by side with it, peering into the window of the studio. Such was his trepidation, that, for a moment or two, he saw nothing distinctly. When the dimness of his vision departed, he beheld only a confused group of women in the middle of the room, and Apelles in the rear, with his back turned towards him. He appeared to be arranging his pallet. Suddenly he turned, and looking towards the window, seized a cord near him, giving it a violent pull, and--in- stantly a green curtain was run across the aperture of the window, entirely closing it. Poor Xylon saw that he had been discov- ered. Confusion and fear so completely over- came him, that he lost not only his presence of mind, but his balance. His foot slipped, and he would have been in danger of breaking his neck, had he not instinctively caught hold of the scarecrow, which, coming to the ground with him, served to break the fall. The shock, however, nearly knocked the breath from his body; and when he rose, his knees trembled and smote one another so violently,   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 293 that it was with the greatest difficulty that he regained the house, more dead than alive. Passing through the passage leading to the pupils' studio, he was met by the fair Zoe, who could not fail to be struck by the change of his appearance, and his tottering gait. "What ails you, O Xylon?" asked she, with unfeigned concern. "L What has befallen you?" He could only stammer a few words to the effect, that he was very unwell; and entering the studio, sank trembling into a chair. Observing his deadly paleness, she seized an ewer of water, and dashed the -contents into his face. "Ah, Zoe," said he, when-he had recovered sufhciently to speak intelligibly, "I ant ruined, undone! What shall I do? where shall I hide my head? Give me your counsel." "Tell me what danger threatens, then; for I cannot imagine why you are in such fear." "Ah, Zoe," sighed the wretched youth; "' seduced by the example of the mischievous Euphorus, who yesterday climbed the plum tree, and beheld the fair Campaspe, I foolishly attempted the same thing a minute since, and     294       APELLES. got my labor and a fall for my pains. Apel- les saw me, and drew  the window-curtain. In my fall I brought down the scarecrow, which should have proved a warning to me, as well as to the birds, not to meddle with forbidden fruit. Woe is me!" "Is that all?" asked Zoe, who could not help smiling at his inordinate terror. '"All? is it not enough that I shall be banished from the studio, by my master's in- dignation? What, if he should inform the king of my misconduct? Before the sun sets, I shall be exposed to -the scoffs of the citizens, my ears nailed to the door-posts of my mother's house, and over my head this inscription:-- ' Such is the reward of impertinent curiosity."' Here he wept bitterly. "Nay! fear no such consequences," said the compassionate maiden, who really began to fear for his reason. "Apelles would be the last person to mention the matter to Alexan- der; and if he should chide you, though I am by no means sure he saw you, lay all the blame on me; say that I requested you to pick a few plums for me. I will bear you witness.'   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 295 "Thanks, gentle Zoe; I had thought of a similar excuse, but if you will confirm my words, I am   safe and infinitely obliged by your kindness." Neither Zoe nor her timid accomplice were (aware that they were planning a deliberate lie! The Greelks were proverbial for cunning and deceit. Lies of this description were con- sidered as "witty inventions," worthy of ap- plause in proportion to their success. "Health to the fair Zoe," said Euphorus, gayly, on entering the room. '( Health to the nimble climber of trees," she rejoined. "You little imagined, when in the plum-tree yesterday, that I was watching you. I was puzzled to account for the pres- ence of two  scarecrows, until I observed that one  of them  was staring, like Cymon  at Iphigenia." "To-day I have no occasion to climb, in order to  see beauty. What I saw yester- day does not equal the half of that which now fills my eyes." "You are a false flatterer," said Zoe; "I will listen no more, lest I be thought foolish enough to believe you." A slight blush and     296       APELLES. a merry laugh, as she left the room, told Euphorus that his flattery was not altogether unwelcome. ' I cannot believe that she saw me yester- day, as she pretends. I shrewdly suspect, my friend, that you have told tales. Why did you so?" "It was your fault," said Xylon, in some confusion. "The success of your monkey tricks induced me to follow your example. I was seen by Apelles, -I think, and was obliged to consult Zoe for a plausible ex- cuse.1"He then gave a full account of his unhappy adventure, omitting only to mention his fall, which he described as a nimble. leap to the ground, " when," concluded he, ' I made for the house with the fleetness of a deer." Observing that Euphorus looked some- what surprised at his account of his agile movements,--"I -am  not much given to athletic exercises," said he, " but, on an emer- gency, I am as nimble as a cat." Remembering the grave counsels of his friend, on the- preceding day, Euphorus could not repress his laughter. "Your mishap, O Xylon, reminds me of   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 297 ihat which befel one of my father's shepherds. Old Agenor daily sent his two sons to drive a flock of sheep to an enclosed pasture. As the distance was short, he was surprised and annoyed to find, that they seldom returned within an hour or two. He was ill satisfied with the excuses they readily gave, and de- termined to watch them.  Accordingly, one morning, he followed at a distance, and when they entered the pasture, he concealed himself behind a thicket, whence he could watch their mnovements. The  pasture was bounded  on three sides by stone-walls and bushes, and on the fourth by the river Lydias. The surface of the land was uneven, nearly level with the river at the lower end, but much raised at the upper part by a high bluff' or bank, overhang- ing the deep stream  below. It was near this bank that he saw  the sheep browsing, with a fine old ram  at their head. The bovs were on the bank close to the river's edge. Pres- ently the eldest, stooping down, held behind him his hat as a  tempting mark to the ram, who, shaking his horns, made a bound, charging full tilt at the boy. He, springing  nimbly aside, caused the ram to overshoot his mark,     298       APELLES. and to fall into the river; he then floated down the current until he reached the lower end, where obtaining foothold, he returned to his flock. This sport was renewed three or four times; to the great amusement of the boys, and the intense ire of their father, who, / . seizing a bundlej!of twigs, administered to each a sound flagelation/ and sent them home. "He was standing alone on the bank, men- tally cursing the mischievous nature of boys, when he saw the ram approach him with a menacing toss of his head. There was some- thing irresistibly comic in his attitude. The old man smiled.  'So, old bellwether,' said he, ' you would like to challenge me, would you?' He stooped as he had seen the boys do, but not possessing the quickness of their eyes or limbs, he did not succeed in eluding the accurate aim of his enemy, but was in- stantly knocked into ten cubits of water. As he swam down the current, his ears were greeted by loud shouts of laughter, and turn- ing his head, he saw his two sons emerge from the very thicket, where he had himself been concealed, and make for home in an ecstasy of glee and hilarity."   ADVENTURES OF XYON AND EUPHORUS. 299 In spite of his mortification and chagrin, Xylon wras forced to laugh until tears ran down his cheeks.  Presently he started- "What noise is that?" asked he.  "What are they doing in the garden?' 'a Let us see," said Euphorus, and hastening to the spot whence the sounds proceeded, they beheld the gardener, with an axe, felling the plum-tree, apparently by the order of Apelles, who was standing by. Xylon would have slunk back, but Euphorus bade him show no signs of fear, as that would be the surest way of accusing himself. "Put a  bold face on the matter," said he; " take my  advice for once." "' Ah, Xylon," said his master, "I have been obliged to sacrifice a valuable fruit tree. The worthy merchant who    built this house, spared no pains or expense in laying out his garden.  This plum-tree was imported from Damascus, and  he was wont to boast, that there might be larger gardens, but none pro- ducing fruit to compare with his Royal Da- mascene.

A WHOLE month had elapsed since Apelles had commenced his picture of the Venus Anadyomene.  Time  had flown  on  rapid wing, and, with the exception of one day, that after Alexander's last visit, every hour had proved to the painter an age of happiness. In the presence of his beloved, the air which she breathed seemed laden with perfume, the con- templation of her beauty filled him with de- light, and the sound of her voice fell upon his ear like a bewitching melody. With the for- titude of a  martyr, he had abstained from any betrayal of his passion; he forbore to offer his hand to assist her on occasions where the conm- mon courtesies of life would have given him a   ready excuse. He dared not undergo the ordeal of such a  temptation. By an indefina- ble magnetic communication, he was informed that the fair Larissean was aware of his pas. sion, and reciprocated it with equal ardor.     304       APELLES. The joy with which he hailed this conviction took too full possession of his soul to leave room for idle regrets or complaints of the cruel destinies of fate. But now his picture, in the last stage of completion, warned him that he must soon part with all that was dear to him, and forego pleasures which he prized more than his existence. Absorbed by these melancholy reflections, he was sitting one afternoon in his library, when a domestic announced, that the king had been waiting for some time in the studio. Alexander was seated in a pensive attitude, contemplating the picture before him. As he gazed upon the symmnetry of its form and the expression of the features, an indefinable etno- tion arose in his bosom. He beheld visions of beauty and loveliness such as had never before dawned upon his imagination. Was it regret that he beheld only imaginary perfection, or some mysterious principle of nature, which caused his heart to overflow with melancholy pathos. To his own surprise, the warrior king was moved to tears. "With such a look," said he, "didst thou subdue the soul of fiery Ares."   A ROYAL BOON.       305 Turning to Apelles, who had just entered, "I know not how it is, my friend," said he, 'the sight of this perfect work has filled me with a strange pleasure. The sublimity of its beauty has an effect upon me like that of tragedy. How difterent is this noble creation from the coquettish character of the goddess which my vulgar imagination had pictured to itself?" "I am well rewarded, if my lord be pleased," said Apelles. c I have exhausted the resources of my art in attempting to rival the grace and beauty of the original, but in vain." "You have surpassed the original," said Al- exander, enthusiastically. "I wonder that, like Pygmalion of old, you have not prayed to Ju- piter to animate your creation with the breath of life." "I have done so; but the god has not lis. tenled to my presumptuous prayers." "Perhaps," said Alexander, " the son of Am- mon may grant the prayer which his father has denied. Dost thou love Campaspe  ?" 'is direct question, accompanied by so sig- ilificant a remark, encouraged Apelles to reply without hesitation. 20     306       APELLES. "You ask me a question, O king, which I have never dared to ask of myself. To behold her is to love her. It is not my fault, but my misfortune, to have beheld charms which are unattainable." "I would bestow her upon thee, if I thought thou wouldst make her happy." Apelles knelt silently in an attitude of ear- nest supplication. "Summon her hither; nay, go not yourself, but send for her; I would witness your meet- ing." "I have sent for thee, Campaspe," said Al- exander, addressing the trembling maiden, "to impart some news affecting thy future life. A distinguished and worthy friend of mine has asked thy hand in marriage. What sayest thou to the proposal?" "Campaspe is a slave," she replied, with a tone of deep dejection, "and has no will of her own." "Nay," said Alexander, "thou art no slave, nor have I ever treated thee as one. I will ask but one question; and I swear by the heads of Pluto and Proserpine that I will abide by thine answer. Wilt thou accept the hand of my   A ROYAL BOON.      307 best friend, Apelles,whose heart thou hast stolen fromn me?"

DROPPING the history of the passion of our hero, we pause awhile to record some incidents which befel his pupil Xylon, the unlucky. For some months he had secretly nourished a ten- der regard for a young damsel, who had so far captivated his fancy that he began seriously to think of matrimony. His approaches, however, were so timid and cautious, that the object of his affections was entirely ignorant of his intentions. Her unconscious manner Xylon at- tributed to indifference, and he was unwilling to risk a refusal. The kindness of Zoe on the oc- casion of his ill-starred adventure in the plum- tree, directed his attention to her pretty little person. He fancied that he was beginning to transfer to her all his affections. By sundry presents of flowers, and by other delicate little attentions, he flattered himself that he was be- ginning to make a favorable impression.     812       APELLES. He was one day, late in the afternoon, en- gaged in searching for some drawing materials in a dark closet of the studio. In the mean- time, Euphorus had entered unperceived by the absent-minded Xylon, whose attention was pres- ently attracted to words spoken by Euphorus to some other person in the room. "What news bring you from Menelaus?" asked he. "What Menelaus?  I know not to whom you allude," replied the merry voice of Zoe. "I beg your pardon, Zoi p ov; I took you for fair Helen of Troy, so blooming and radiant do you shine in beauty to-day. I meant to inquire of the health of your royal spouse." "I hate flattery!" said Zoe, with a tone which betokened no displeasure. ( "What have you done to your cheek? asked Euphorus, with an air of concern. "Let me examine it more closely." A loud smack, followed by a slap upon the cheek, told Xylon that he had been forestalled by his lively friend. "Naughty boy!" said Zoe; "you only do that to drive me away." Xylon here thought it prudent to cough,   XYON WOOS BY PROXY.    313  nd Zoe tripped out of the studio with the flut- ering whirr of a startled partridge on the wing. As Xylon sneaked forth from  his hiding- lace, Euphorus burst into a fit of laughter. I fear, my friend," said he, "that accident as prematurely betrayed to you a secret. I n betrothed to the sister of our master, and n only waiting a favorable opportunity to ask s consent." "I congratulate you with all my heart," said ylon; secretly rejoicing that he was no longer danger of making an ass of himself. "And have you no secret to tell me in re- rn?" "I will confess to you, Euphorus, that I  ve frequently thought of a certain damsel likely to make a charming wife, but am by means sure that she reciprocates my feelings. have poured libations of wine before her )r, and sprinkled its posts with the choicest ces of the grape, but am still without any ications of her favor." And who is the scornful beauty?" asked  phorus, with great curiosity. It is Lesbia, the daughter of the chief mag- ate of the city."     314       APELLES. "Why, man, she would jump to have you. Why have you not asked her hand from her worthy father?" "I should be sorry to ask and be denied," said the cautious lover. "Nonsense!--do you think she will ever propose to you? But is she not a thought too fat and clumsy?" '"It is for that very reason that I admire her. I have observed that lean and graceful girls, especially the black-eyed ones, though gentle as doves before marriage, are apt to become perfect dragons afterwards. I must have a wife of whose good temper I am  sure. I would have no other as a companion for life." "This very evening," said Euphorus, "we will go to her father. You shall wait in the street while I propose the match to him. I will put the matter in such a train that, with- out compromising you, I will pave the way for you, so that you need not fear a refusal. I can say for you much that you cannot say for yourself." "You are a true friend," said the delighted Xylon, " and I accept your assistance with pleasure."   XYON WOOS BY PROXY.        315 Punctual to the appointed hour, Xylon made his appearance, and the two friends walked forth on their errand. Passing through a nar- row street, they beheld a bright light issuing from the open front of a cook-shop, and heard a stentorian voice singing and declaiming like Hercules in the Alcestis. "Surely," said Euphorus, "that is the voice of Griphos. Under pretence of some errand, he has stolen away to junket and guzzle to his heart's content.  Let us have some sport." The old fellow was seated at a small table) over the debris of a meat-pasty and two or three empty wine measures. His bleared eyes were rolling with a fine frenzy, as he recited, or rather shouted out,- "Snow on! hail on! cast darkness all around me! Let loose thy thunders; let thy lightnitngs wound me! I care not, Jove, but thy worst rage defy, Nor will I cease to revel till I die. Spare but my life, and let thy thunders roar, And lightnings flash,-I'll only revel more. Thunderer! a god more potent far than thee, To whom thou too hast yielded, maddens me." $ With upraised arm, he gesticulated so vio- lently that the veins started from his forehead * Asclepiades.     316       APEILL1E S. and temples like snakes around the head of a Gorgon. Inflating his cheeks until they resem- bled those of a glassblower before a fiery fur- nace, he gave out a loud sound not unlike that of a conch-shell, and drummed upon the table with both fists till every plate and metal pot danced, jingled, and added to the obstreperous riot of his excitement. He had no sooner emptied his capacious lungs, than, drawing in his breath, he gave a powerful imitation of the braying of a jackass, which he ended by three prolonged whistling sighs, and dropped his head on his breast, as if in the act of expiring. It was sometime before Euphorus could com- mand himself sufficiently to disguise his voice, 'when he approached Griphos and asked, - Art thou a reverend priest of Bacchus, or only a devotee?" "Neither," said Griphos, with a hiccup. "ou ought to know me, for I am in great request at all fashionable entertainments and feasts; my name is ever in the mouths of the wittiest and most accomplished women." This was an allusion of the old fellow to his own name; 7pL os is the Greek for certain jeux d'esprit, such as enigmas, riddles, and co-   XYON WOOS BY PROXY.    317 nundrums, which formed an important part of all gay feasts and convivial meetings. Me- nander, and even the impassioned Sappho did not disdain to amuse themselves by sometimes exercising their genius in this line. "You have given me a riddle," said Eupho- rus,!' and it requires no CEdipus to solve it. Thou art old Griphos, the thief and glutton. What hast thou stolen to-day?" "Ha! vile persecutor! hast thou dogged me hither? ' said the pot-valiant toper. "Begone, or I will cudgel that ass-hide of thine until it shall not be worth the tanning!" "Thou hast a good memory, Griphos. That is the threat which drove thee in terror from the shop of the pastry-cook, whom thou didst attempt to cozen out of two oil cakes for the price of one." As Griphos seized a huge platter, to hurl it at the head of the unknown speaker, the youths thought it prudent to retire. On arriving at the house of his beloved, the heart of Xylon began to fail him. Euphorus gave him no time for repentance; but, bidding hin to wait in the street, knocked for admission, and was immediately ushered into the presence     318  '.     APELLES. of a middle-aged man, the father of Lesbia, who sat reading to him. A very cordial reception from the magistrate did not conceal from Euphorus his surprise at this unexpected visit. He made a bold push, however, and dived at once in medias res. "I have come to complain of the cruelty of this young maiden towards a very dear friend of mine. She has robbed him of his peace of mind so completely that the only repara- tion she can make is to give him her hand in marriage." "Pray, who is your friend?" asked the father, who began to be aware that some one was making a formal proposal. "Xylon, my friend and fellow-student in the studio of Apelles. I have assumed the re- sponsibility of informing you of his sentiments simply because his modesty rates his own merits so low, and those of your daughter so high, that he has not yet dared to aspire to an honor of which he is in every respect worthy." "I know the young man well," said the father. "His birth, fortune, and education entitle him to ask in marriage any lady of   XYON WOOS BY PROXY.    319 the city. What say you to his proposal, Les- bia?" "He is not handsome," said the pouting beauty, doubtfully. 6 I wishy" said Euphorus, " you could see him with my eyes. Although somewhat dark of complexion, he has a fine, manly figure; and when his intellectual features are animated by enthusiasm, his smile is perfectly fascinating. If you could hear him, recite his own verses in which he praises your beauty and complains of his sufferings, I am sure your heart would melt like snow before the fire. It grieves me to see him so desponding. For a month he has eaten nothing, and passes such wretched, sleepless nights, that I sometimes fear he will make away with himself." "Poor silly fellow!" said Lesbia, with a smile of pleasure and compassion; "I should be sorry to have any harm come to him." "Seriously, my daughter, I think you might go farther and fare worse. He is a young man of excellent character, and I hear bids fair to excel in his noble profession." "My father's wishes are always commands," said Lesbia, with becoming modesty and sub- mission.     320       APELLES. "That's a sensible girl!" said her father, affectionately patting her cheek. "Tell your young friend to present himself, and he may depend on a cordial reception." "A thousand thanks!" said Euphorus. "I fly on the wings of Mercury to give him life and hope. Within a few short moments he will be here." Respectfully saluting both father and daugh- ter, Euphorus rushed into the street, where he found Xylon, who had by this time come to a hopeless conviction that he was to hear a prompt and decided refusal. "Joy, joy, my friend!" said Euphorus, clasp- ing his hand. "It is all settled; both father and daughter are delighted with your proposal. You have only to present yourself to have the consent of Lesbia from her own lips." "Seriously?" asked Xylon. "What did you say for me?" "Oh, a thousand things. I told her you were dying for love of her; that you wrote verses about her, and that you had lost both sleep and appetite." "How could you invent such falsehoods?" said Xylon, reproachfully.   XYON WOOS BY PROXY.    321 "Are they falsehoods?-then you ought to be ashamed of yourself. These are the symp- toms of true love, and I took it for granted that you had experienced them, when you con- fessed that you were enamoured. Besides, all is fair in love. If you do not attack a woman's imagination, you can never win her heart. My conscience does not reproach me in the least. In fact, I was encouraged to go a little further than I intended, by her father, who winked to me, as much as to say, ' Lay it on strong, my young painter.' But cock your pylidion more knowingly. There," said he, adjusting his friend's hat on the side of his head, in that fantastic style by which Grecian youths indi- cated that they were far gone with the tender passion, " that's your true lover's angle!" "But I can't see," said Xylon, peevishly; "you have entirely covered my left eye!" "Never mind, man; that's the way to look at a picture, and you are soon to behold a rare one. Don't stay here wasting your time, but show yourself at once, in hot haste. Let me advise you, though, to take a brisk trot, the length of the street and back again, so that you may be out of breath on arriving." 21     322       APELLES. Euphorus had assumed this gay, rattling tone only to raise the spirits of his friend, and arouse him from his owlish gravity. Having succeeded in making him laugh heartily, he warmly pressed his hand and went his way.   CONCLUSION.

Euphorus, congratulating his master on his prospects of happiness, took occasion to put in a plea for the hand of Zoe. Apelles at once welcomed him warmly as a brother, assuring him, that so agreeable a disposal of his sister left him nothing to desire. Xylon easily persuaded his Lesbia not to lose so brilliant an opportunity of entering on her married life, and accord- ingly the same day was fixed upon for the mar- riage of Apelles and his two pupils. The ceremonies of the eventful day com- menced with the decoration of the brides, which was completed by the formal act of placing on the head of each a chaplet of roses. This service, usually performed by the bride's mother, was, with stately condescension, ren- dered by the Queen Olympias to the bride     326       APELLES. of Apelles. Erophile, with truly maternal pride, adorned the brow of her lovely daughter; and Lesbia, who had lost her own mother, was indebted to the mother of her bridegroom for the crowning ornament of her nuptial ap- parel. A long procession of chariots was in wait- ing to convey the party to the temple of Mi- nerva, with becoming ceremony and solemnity. It was usual for the bride to be seated be- tween her father and her husband. Campaspe had the honor of being placed between Apel- les and the king, who volunteered to take the place of a father. "I fear," said Alexander, smiling, "that old Philip (the name of the elephant, which had usually borne Campaspe) would be in a sav- age rage if he could know that he is denied the honor of bearing you to the temple." Campaspe smiled. "Poor Philip!" said she; "the sagacious and affectionate old creature! I am very fond of him, but must say, that I much prefer the smooth and easy motion of the chariot, to that of his slow and rolling gait." "In that case," said Alexander, " it is well that we are not Bceotians. They always burn   CONCLUSION.      327 the axle of the carriage, which brings the bride from the temple,-intimating that her future duties are at home, and that she has no further occasion to go abroad. It was also formerly the custom for the bride to shear her head of all its tresses, which were depos- ited upon the altar of. Hymen. The present fashion supposes that the god is reasonable enough to be propitiated by the sacrifice of a single lock." The torch-bearer, who led the way, gave the. signal for the procession to move. A chorus of youths and young virgins, gayly decked with garlands, began to chant the nup- tial song. Loud strains of music rose, swelling, and filling the air with gladness. On arriving at the temple, they found it filled to overflowing by crowds, who had flocked together to witness the brilliant and imposing spectacle. Three separate offerings were formally laid upon the altar. A long tress of raven hair, blacker than midnight was deposited by the fair hands of Campaspe; another, of rich brown, was contributed by Zoe; and the blushing Lesbia threw down an auburn ringlet, which,     328        APELLES. in the eyes of Xylon, shone like a skein of golden threads. The father and mother of Euphorus stood by, and witnessed the ceremony with evident complacency.  The usual gravity of the old gentleman was laid aside for the occasion, and he seemed to be in high spirits. "The young dog has brought his handsome person to a very pretty market," said he. "Apelles must be very rich, for his pencil coins money faster than the mint. I should never have dreamed of my son's making such a match. I wonder where he got his impudent assurance! not from me, I am sure." "She is a charming bride," said the mother, c" and in every way worthy of him." "They are not a bad-looking couple, my wife; but on the day when we were spliced,* I think a handsomer one might have been seen in this very temple -eh?"

When the last religious rite was consummated, the three brides were conducted to their respective homes. On entering his house, Apelles received a note couched in the most flattering terms. "ALEXANDER TO APELLES, GREETING:-- "I accept with pleasure, my friend, the price- less Venus, which you have this day sent me. You are pleased to say, that it is but a poor return for the gift I have bestowed upon you.

"To-morrow  I take up my line of march into Asia. Fare thee well." Having conducted my hero to the very summit of human bliss and prosperity, I now propose, gentle and fair reader, to bid you adieu.     330       APELLES. What? -" a little more?" This is hardly fair. When you have finished your best and choicest song, and your en- chanted lover begs for one more, what a variety of pretty excuses and ingenious sub- terfuges you have recourse to, in order not to spoil the effect, which you have so artistically got up! "Only a very little more?" Well, to set you an example of self-sacrifice, I will conclude by giving you a glimpse of a gay party, assembled at the house of the father of Euphorus, in honor of the three brides. Zoe laughingly complained to Campaspe, that Euphorus had nearly been the cause of her death, on account of sundry ingenious tricks, which he was in the habit of daily playing off upon a blind old slave of his father's. "By a species of ventriloquism," said she, "he makes him believe, that a strange lad is at the open window or door-way, insulting and heaping abuse upon him. The old man's rage is so ludicrous, that I have been obliged to make him promise not to excite it again, on pain of seeing me expire with laughter."   CONCLUSION.      331 "I am not so easily put to death," said Campaspe. "Cannot you give me a specimen of your skill, Euphorus?" "Do!" said Zoe, with a glee which proved that the idea of dying with laughter was not an unpleasant one. "With all my heart," said Euphorus, 4 pro. vided you will promise to keep your counte- nances, and not spoil the sport by laughing aloud." Repairing to the kitchen, he found Griphos busily engaged in frying a dish of pig's liver and fresh oil cakes for his own dainty supper. Standing in the shade of the door-way, Eu- phorus shouted, in his usual feigned voice,- "At last, O thieving glutton, the hour of retribution is come. I saw thee just now at the backdoor, bartering a costly brace of pheasants for the filthy oil cakes, which thou art now preparing for thy gluttonous maw. But I have come to inform thy master of thy turpitude." "Begone, buffoon!" said Griphos, turning suddenly round, and peering into vacancy; "or on this spot, I will brain thee with this frying-pan."      332       APELLES. "How now, Griphos," said Euphorus, in his natural tone; "what means this altercation between thee and this stranger?" "May it please you, master, this is the in- solent persecutor, who dogs me night and day. Let him be seized and scourged until he be cured of his impertinence." "He is a thief, and I can prove it," said the strange voice. "This is a serious charge," said Euphorus; "follow me, both of you, into the triclinium." "Never fear, Griphos," said Euphorus, in a whisper; "I only mean to detain him until I can have him beaten as he deserves." A low chuckle of delight was the only response made, and Euphorus saw that he was wrought up to the proper point for ex- hibition. "Stand you here in the door-way, Griphos," said Euphorus,- motioning to all present to preserve silence. "How dare you, sirrah, to invent such foul calumnies against an honest fellow, whose faithfulness has been made evi- dent by years of hard service?" The strange voice replied,-"His larcenies are known to all the world, excepting his   CONCLUSION.      333 confiding master. I saw him, a few minutes since, sell a brace of choice pheasants to a vagabond, at the back-gate." "That is impossible," said Euphorus; "for strict orders have been given to have every door of the house locked." "May it please you, master," roared out Griphos, "he is a shameless, lying varlet; there is not one word of truth in all he says. May the carrion-crow defile his grave! or rather, may his body be denied the rites of burial, and his flesh be picked from his bones by vultures. May his ghost be condemned to wander up and down the banks of the Styx for ages, without an obolos to pay his fare to the unrelenting Charon!" Judging that it was impossible to add to the height of his impotent rage, Euphorus thought best to conclude the farce as speedily as possible. "Confess that you have maligned this worthy man," said he. The voice answered,-"I have done so only to make sport." "Call you this, sport?" said Euphorus, in a pretended passion. Violently grasping his own throat, so as to give the effect of one choking, he exclaimed, -     334       APELLES. "Nay, hurt me not, master, and I will never offend again." "I will make sure that thou dost not; for heavy as thou art, thus I seize thee, and hurl thee, like a cat, out of the window." "Ha!" said Griphos, rubbing his hands with delight; "he has got it, at last; the dolt! the ass! the impertinent buffoon! He has got it!" and he hastened back to the kitchen, to finish his supper in peace and quiet. The father of Euphorus completely lost his gravity, in the hilarity of the occasion. Catch- ing the infectious laugh of Campaspe, he held on to his portly sides as if he felt they were in danger. As soon as a moment of silence ensued, Zoe presenting to Xylon (no longer "the un- lucky ") a delicious plum, -"May I offer you a Royal Damascene?" asked she, with an arch expression. "You may here enjoy its luscious flavor without exposure to the danger of a fall, which, sometimes, is the punishment of those who climb after forbidden fruit." "Your heart must be as hard as a plum- stone," said Xylon, reproachfully, " to jeer me with an allusion to that unhappy adventure."   CONCLUSION.       335 You forget," said Zoe, "that the stone is not the heart of the plum, but has an inner kernel, which is all softness." "But not devoid of bitterness," responded Xylon,- with an aih of satisfaction, as he achieved his first and nearest approach to a witticism.     I If   NOTES. 22     A I     NOTES. NOTE I.  Page 212. IN accordance with the rule of Aristotle, that even in works of fiction there should be a basis of reality, we have given to the vessel, in which Apelles returned home, the name of a ship duly registered at the period of our story. The side-digressions of an author, in his march through the regions of fancy, are often exceedingly instructive; a brief sketch of the sources of our information in this trivial matter may prove not uninteresting to the reader. In 1834, some workmen, employed in excavating, in order to lay the foundations of a royal magazine at Pir eus, came upon the remains of an old conduit. On taking up the works, it was found that the bottom of the drain was. composed of marble slabs covered on the under side with antique Greek inscriptions, which, lying on the ground and not exposed to the friction of a muddy current, were in remarkably fine preservation. On careful examination, it was ascertained that they constituted a series of records of the commissioners of the Attic navy for a period of years, covering a large portion of the public life of Demos- thenes. These substantial and authentic records give the names     340          NOTES. of over two hundred and fifty vessels, and of their build- ers. They were deposited in the temple of Theseus, and a copy of them forwarded to Professor Boeckh, of Berlin, enabled him to compile an interesting work on the Attic Navy, " iber das See-wesen des Attischen Staates." From a list of the names of Attic vessels given by the learned Ger- man, we have selected ETHMEPIA, as one of the most pleasing and appropriate. One of these tablets records the fact, that, in that year, De- mosthenes and several other eminent orators (among them, Demades) had paid over to the commissioners the sums of money for which they were responsible, as sureties for the vessels lent by Athens to the Chalcidians. The date cor- responds with that laid down by historians, as the year in which King Philip endeavored to obtain a foothold in the cities of Euboea, but was expelled by the united efforts of the Chalcidians and the Athenians. The fact that Demos- thenes and other orators paid money for the loan of ships to carry on a war against Philip is not elsewhere recorded; and it is not a little singular that so important a fact should be brought to light, after a lapse of over two thousand years, by the digging up of an old drain! We trust that the reader will duly appreciate the extent of our archaeological researches, in the framing of our story, -," Tantce molis erat." NOTE II. Page 250. Many distinguished artists - among them Sir Joshua Rey- nolds, Fuseli, and Flaxman--have hinted at the proba-   NOTES.           341 bility of mathematical and geometrical rules having been employed by ancient artists, both in painting and sculp- ture; but, as yet, little or nothing has been done by the moderns to establish a canon of form, or to organize a system of composition.  "How. well," says Flaxman, ' the ancients understood the balance of' the figure, is proved by the two books of Arc-himedes on the subject; besides, it is impossible to see the numerous figures springing, jumping, dancing, and falling, in the Herculaneum paintings, on vases and antique basso-rilievos, without being assured that the painters and sculptors must have employed geometri- cal figures to determine the degrees of curvature of the body, the angular or rectilinear extent of the limbs, and to fix the centre of gravity." In the works of Professor Schadow, the Abbe Robbiani, and several French writers, may be found many valuable sucggestions relating to this matter. It is singular that mod- ern artists should neglect this branch of study, especially as we find old Vitruvius citing the practice of ancient painters and sculptors as an illustration of some rules he lays down in architecture. After mentioning the leading proportions of the figure,- ' Similarly," he says, " have the other members their due proportions, by attention to which the ancient painters and sculptors obtained so much repiu- tation. Just so, the parts of temples should correspond with each other and with the whole." Considering the subject as one of great importance, and promising a rich harvest to any one willing to labor upon it, the author has made Apelles lay great stress on this branch of the art. At the present day, we are so far from     342          NOTES. having " a canon of form," that no two agree in the pro- portions which they give for the figure; and Composition, instead of being an organized art, is effected by reliance on the accuracy of a well-trained eye alone! Consequently, modern compositions bear no small resemblance, in char- acter, to the works of amateurs, who venture to compose music without any knowledge of the laws of counterpoint. THE END.
