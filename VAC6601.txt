Primeval hope, the Ionian Muses say,  When man and nature mourned their first decay; When every form of death, and every woe Shot from malignant stars to earth below; When murder bared her arm, and rampant war Yoked the red dragon to-her iron car; - When peace and mercy, banished from the plain, Sprung upon the viewless winds to heaven again--    4  All-all forsook the friendless, guilty mind, But "hope," the charmer, lingered still behind.

PRINCIPAL OF PUBLIC SCHOOL DEPT. 8, OF THE CITY OF BROOKLYN, AS A TESTIMONY OF THE WRITER'S HGH REGARD FOR HS EXCELLENT QUALITIES AS  THS BOOK     S  BY HS FORMER PUPIL AND FRIEND, Author       PREFACE. In the following pages, it has been the author's study to avoid the adoption of any peculiar style. It has, on the contrary, been our endeavor to relate W enes as they actually transpired, and in as simple a manner as possible. We hope that we have succeeded. Our tale is not alone drawn from the picturings of a lively imagination, but is mostly the simple relation of facts. While stating this, we are aware that all tales are said to be "founded on facts."  In a general sense, probably they are; for most writers have an original for all their characters in their mind's eye while writing. Our characters are real, the scenes which are described as having transpired are true, and- some of the characters the author has introduced under their real names.  To write a book would seem to be a pleasant pas- time. To us it has been so. For amusement the follow-     Vi         PREFACE. ing facts were woven into a tale; and this season of the author's experience was as pleasant as any dream of fairy-land. But, when we came to disbursing for printing, binding, press-work, etc., " a change came o'er the spirit of our dreams," and we found that our first disinterested desire to write for the amusement of the public has deepened into a mercenary craving for a return of our expenditures. Yes, ye bands of "disin- terested" authors, who express yourselves satisfied if, in some remote corner of the world, your works shall be read and appreciated, seize your pens and hurl your thunders of indignation and criticism upon our devoted heads for openly proclaiming ourselves mercenary, and we shall/loudly utter our disgust of this - disinterested" profession if it don't "pay." Here we rest, and turn to the moral of our tale." In Annie Wallace we have an example of a hopeful disposition, one which, under all circumstances--ay, even during the darkpst hours of adversity and moments of bit- ter disappointment-retained one diamond-bright spark of " hope," whose light could be narrowed down until it illumined but one small chamber in the heart, but which finally regained new strength and invigorated her t whole being,  Reader, could we all cultivate such a disposition, we would have reason to rejoice.   PREFACE.         vii In Henry Monteith we recognize a gentlemanly, well-educated, generous, free-hearted young Scotchman, possessing a proud heart and strong, lasting affections. Peter Wallace is but a fair type of a lively, laughter- loving, brave young British midshipman, and affection ate, high-spirited brother. In Philip Marcella we find a character something out of the ordinary line. He was a young man of a fierce temper and revengeful passions; who, with the assistance 6f a strong resolu- tion and sound principles, succeeded in controlling both.  Over such a character as Walter Jamieson we have occasion to weep. He was a young man naturally of a good disposition, and possessed of noble impulses; but the good in his nature had never been cultivated, and, like many young men around us daily, instead of being an ornament to society, he was a disgrace and a pest. In sad contrast to the character of Walter Jamieson is that of Percy Malcolm-a noble, generous, self-sacri- ficing soul-capable of smothering its own aspirations rather than injure a friend. Mrs. Wallace is a remarkable character, but none the less natural; for, of all the characters in the book, there are none copied so true to life as is that of Mrs. Wallace -the cunning, scheming step-mother-bent on the aggrandizement of herself and child; and for this nefa-     N Viii        PREFACE. rious end bringing into play all the powers of a cold, selfish, calculating disposition, to the utter disregard of those whom the laws of God and man call loudly on her to protect and succor. We do not put this charac- ter forth as a universal type; but such there are in the world. Robert Jamieson is represented as a professor, and such he really is at this moment, if living.  But we must close with the wish, that our tale may afford our readers as much satisfaction in the reading as it has done us in the writing, and we are content. THE AUTHOR.

FOR about a month past, the lovers of gossip in the pretfy town of Gr--  , Scotland, had had an absorbing topic for / discussion over their tea-tables, and wash-tubs, and during their -careless morning calls, in the recent arrival at the mansion of the village doctor of a very youthful and very beautiful stranger, whose coming seemed to be veiled by a great deal of mystery. There was great diversity of opinion among the peasantry in regard to the young lady's -parentage and place of birth; some declaring that her dark complexion was an indisputable proof of her Spanish origin, while others, who had heard the young lady speak, decided bhat her English pronunciation betrayed her Saxon birth, and that the darkness of her complexion was attributable to a long residence in India. Various" other con- flicting opinions were expressed, but how near any of them came to the truth, will be disclosed in due time in the course of our tale. "Ye dinna ken o' the name o' the land that witnessed the comin' o' the fine leddie that's staying a' the house," cried the Widow Stoddart, one fine morning, as she met one of the doc- tor's servants, face' to face, in a by-path, leading to the mansion. "I hae nae right to be tellin' the secrets o' the house," an- '  ,-     2          ANNIE WALLACE . swered the lively Mary, thus adroitly insinuating that she knew all, but would not tell, and feeling herself quite an important personage in being able to excite the curiosity of the gossiping old widow, who was generally the one that possessed all the information, and who seldom was under the necessity of seeking it from others. "Ye mae we'el tak o' the secrets o' ,the house, but de'il a secret does your ain bosom hide," said the penetrating widow. "An' I'm right gled ye know it; an' I'd been obleeged to ye if y hadn't asked me,"a'd, tossing her head disdainfully, the buxom maid passed on. "Ye dinna ken the ta'k o' the place, in spite o' your fine ways," muttered the old dame, as she hobbled away, determined to know all she wished, without going to a " young lass that don't stand fair, accordin' to ta'k," as she expressed it; and with this very laudable purpose, Widow Stoddart tottered along, mut- tering to herself--"It's a sorry day when the young lassies o' the town will be settin' 'emselves up above the auld heads o' the place, wha loaned a helping hand to make their swaddling clothes: it's nae gleg aneuch for-'em'Ato be trigged off in fine trappins; troth, an' we maun put up wi' such like; buto de'il a harm or bad thought did that coghng whelp o' a lass raise in the, bosom o' the Widow Stoddart, none o' wha's bluid was ever disgraced by such ta'k, as the fine folks o' the town is indulgin' in agin the lass that's stayin' as maid a' the house." Thus the irritated widow continued to give vent to her spleen, when she was suddenly startled by the shout of the doctor's boy, who just at that moment was letting down the bars for the cows. "Halloa there! Dame Stoddart, ye maun hae muclkle care lest auld one-horned brindle gie ye sic a punch in the back as will leave but a whiff o' breath in your tottering body."- "Ye maun mind yoursel'," cried the widow. "Oush," cried Billie, "ye hae nae right in the lane, and if ye'r knocked down, ye canna blame me." "I'll nae forgie ye, Billie, if ye let the cows on me," plead- ingly said the widow.   THE STRANGER.            3 "De'il a care can I hae for ye if ye won't get out- o' the way." "Billie, Billie," cried a young lady, who just at that moment came into the lane, with a bunch of flowers in her hand; " oh, Billie!" said she, "you wouldn't be so cruel as to let the cows in on such an old woman: for shame, Billie! Behave youself, and put up the bars." "Ye hae naething to fear; I only meant to fright the old crone out o' the lane," said Billie. "But you should not resort to such means, Billie, to get Mis- tress Stoddart out of the way," replied the young stranger, as she advanced and assisted Billie in replacing the bars. Annie Wallace, the young lady who so opportunely interfered for the protection of Widow Stoddart, was the young stranger that had recently arrived at the doctor's mansion. Only sixteen summers were traced upon her brow; her complexion was dark, but clear; her hair was as black as an Indian squaw's, but soft *and fine, and hung in beautiful silken curls upon her shoulders. Her forehead was not to be called an intellectual one, yet it was beautifully shaped. Her eyebrows appeared as if they had been clipped from a Madonna and penciled there, and her long lashes gave a soft expression to her eyes. Her hands were rather too large' to suit a Frenchman, but the beauty of their shape would have satisfied a Raphael. Her feet were small, and her tread as light as a fawn. Her form was most beautifully developed, and all of her attitudes seemed imitations of the Graces. Annie was a lively, thoughtless creature, in spite of all the clouds that dimmed the brightness of her youth. Her interfer- ence in behalf of the widow, aroused the old, crone's pride, and she said to her: "Ye need hae nae fear, my leddie, but that Widow Stoddart will keep her ain agin sicl a noisy brat, wha's more apt to bark than bite; but, my leddie," she continued, "may I be so baujd as to ask if ye intend to make a long stay amang us?" ' I do not know, Mistress Stoddart," replied Annie, "how long I shall stay ;I may stay a very short time, or a very long , .  . .     4          ANNIE WALLACE. time; and if I had one friend here, I would wish it the latter, for I like the place very much." "'Tis a fine place, my leddie, an' I hope ye may like it good enouch to make a lang stay amang us. It's frae India that ye came, my leddie?" "Oh, no; I have just arrived from Kilmarnock," Annie re- plied. "An' was you never in India?" said the widow. But, at that moment Dr. Barton appeared. Annie, instead of replying to Widow Stoddart, gracefully bidding her good-ay, slipped her arm into the doctor's, and returned with him towa/ls the house, while Mistress Stoddart hobbled back to the town, to await a call from some Curious neighbors, to impart all the knowl- edge she had gleaned respecting the stranger. Widow Stodldart (to use a plain expression) was a funny speci- men of humanity. According to her own account, she was nearly - seventy years of age, though lher eyes, even at that age, were as black and brilliant as though she was but seventeen, while her form exhibited unmistakable signs of decay. Her little attenu- ated figure, except when swayed by passion, was weak and feeble. She had a habit, when talking, of placing her staff before her, and holding on to it with both hands; and a formidable thing was that crooked old staff to the mischievous urchins of the town,when they happened to arouse the wrath of its ancient owner.  ) Mi'tstw toddart had a daughter with whom she lived; once she had a son, but, many years ago, he had gone to sea, and since his departure nothing had been heard from him. In some way, the old crone would always be the first one to make her- self mistress of the source and true facts concerning all gossip  and many a sixpence did the Widow Stoddart get for gratifying the curiosity of some of the villagers. But, with all this, she had much discretion; and, when she chose, she could be as close- mouthed as any one, and a piece of silver could as easily buy her silence as- her information; and when Widow Stoddart once promised silece, you might be sure that she would keep her   THE STRANGER.           5 word. She was cunning, yet honest; withal, she was a feeling- hearted old creature, for her tongue was as ready to administer consolation as- it was to return an evasive answer or cutting, reply.     .  After leaving the lane, she proceeded home to her daughter's cottage, and, half an hour afterwards, she might have been seen shaking her stick at her grandchildren, as they pranced about her with a piece of hot gingerbread, which they had just stolen, and were devouring as rapidly as possible, lest their grand-dame might catch them and administer the only punishment they fear ed-to take it away from them. Miss Annie Wallace, whose strange arrival had produced such an excitement in the town, after quitting the Widow Stoddart and proceeding a short way with the doctor, slipped away from him, and commenced clambering up a neighboring wall to reach a rose which attracted her eye: the doctor waited until she had managed to get two or three scratches, when he laughingly bade her come on, and they passed into the house. Dr. Barton's '" mansion," as it was called, was a square, neat building, situated on a piece of rising ground, surrounded by beautiful trees. A piazza ran entirely around the house, which was reached by stone steps in front, and at the back. . A beautiful lawn spread itself to the sight in front, laid out in grassplots, boxwood hedges, and broad gravel-walks, shaded by the beauti- ful cedar and fir-trees which adorned the grounds of the mansion. At the back, an extensive garden refreshed the eye, arranged in curious-shaped plots of flowers, surrounded by boxwood borders, clipped close, and extending into little avenues, ornamented with trees and high bushes, and here and there a statue. in the cen- tre of a grassplot, at the foot of the garden, a small fountain sent forth its sparkling jet d'eau into the air. A gate at the side of the house led into the lane before-mentioned. On the-top of the building-was a kind of cupola, which the doctor appropriated to evening sittings, when he regaled himself with his long Indian pipe.  Doctor Barton was a man well to do in the world, very cheep     6          ANNIE WALLACE. ful and sociable in his disposition, honest and upright in his dealings, and when called upon to attend a case which would ex- ercise all his patience, to get his pay, he would do it with as much alacrity as if it were a duke or an earl. Previous to his marriage, he had been family physician to Sir Charles Stewart Monteith, of Closeburn Hall. At this time there was in the family of Sir Charles a young lady, governess to his only daugh- ter. Doctor Barton had often seen and admired this lady, and k when her pupil became Countess of Mar, by her marriage with the Earl of Mar, and she, like Othello, felt that her' occupation was gone, the doctor, feeling for lher, kindly decided to sooth the young lady 'by making her Mrs. Barton. The marriage took place, and a few weeks subsequently, the doctor removed, with his bride, to the town of G- , Scotland.          Mrs. Barton was decidedly her husband's opposite. Instead of possessing his easy, cheerful disposition, she was cold, calcu- lating, exacting, and harsh; and when her dislike was once aroused, she would, upon every occasion, cause the object of it every trouble or annoyance that lay in her power. Mrs. Barton, in her earlier days, had formed a friendship with a daughter of a West India merchant, who was her exact counter- part, and in this case the general rule, that similars repel, seemed not to hold good. Jane Jamieson and .Mrs. Barton had been bosom friends, and when Miss Jamieson became Mrs Captain Wallace, Mrs. Barton was the first person to whom she dispatched a letter, containing an account of her advantageous marriage with a wealthy East India captain, retired, from service, and settled upon his estates in Scotland. Captain Wallace, the gentleman who became the husband of Miss Jamieson, was a widower, with two interesting children, Annie, a sweet girl, arid Peter, a fine manly boy. When he retired from service and returned to Scotland, his two children were infants, fit only to be left in charge of their ayahs, or In- dian nurses, and too young to commence their education; but, soon as a step-mother was thrust upon them, she decided they/ were old enough to be sent from home to school. \             . .    THE STRANGER.            7 Upon her first interview with these children (which was not . until after her marriage), she ha'd taken a dislike to them, and her crafty, sordid mind beheld in them so many obstacles to the advancement of her own children, that were yet to be, and with a Well-acted hypocrisy, she pleaded the necessity of their being educated from home. The father, though loth to part with his darlings, was finally constrained by her conftinued persuasions to permit-them to be sent off. Annie-his pet--the pride of the old captain's heart, doubly endeared to him in having been born on board of his own ship, during one of those fierce tempests that sometimes sweep over the tropic seas, and thereby connected with the associations of his former life-was sent to Kilmarnock, whilst the younger was sent to another town, some miles distant. Thus far the crafty woman had been successful, and with an un- realized murderous intend in her heart, she determined- to wear out the lives of these two lone orphans by, perpetual annoyance and irritation. Soon as the two children were settled at school, she commenced to spend with a lavish hand the pagodas and rupees of the old merchant captain. In due course of time she became the mother of a son, to whom had been secured by marriage contract the sum of thirty thousand pounds / sterling. Shortly after the birth of this child, the old captain sickened, and those about his bed knew too well his time had come. An- nie heard of her father's illness, and petitioned her step-mother to let her come home and see him before he died. The cruel woman, thinking that a sight of his child would cause him to alter his will, refused her request, and the old man died without seeing either of the children, though his last thoughts were of them, particularly Annie,- whose name dwelt upon his lips when he drew his last breath. Immediately after his death, the widow caused the will to be opened; the contents of thatwill made the hardened and selfish woman blanch with rage, for the testator, after saying that sufficient had been secured to her son y ar- riage contract, bequeathed to his two eldest children te remain- cler of his property, which consisted of five hundred thousand     S          ANNIE WALLACE. pounds sterling, invested in mortgages/on the estates of Earl Murray and Sir John Hoff, of Pinkley; a house in Edinburgh, and a country seat at Bruntisland, in the county Fife. The balance was invested in bank and insurance stock. The testator further went on to say (after appointing his executors and ad- ministrators), that his two eldest children were not to come into t possession until the death of Mrs. Wallace, and were to have only sufficient from the interest for their education and support. After deductingtheir expenses and one thousand pounds sterling per annum, settled upon Mrs. Wallace, the balance of the inter- est was to accumulate for the two elder children. As sodn as the enraged widow fully realized the contents of the will, she determined immediately to increase the annoyance of the two children, and, in furtherance of this plan, she induced, after a time, the special guardian of Peter to procure for him a berth on board an East Indiaman. He being'a relative of her own (and, in fact, all of the trustees were related to her) de- termined to do so: Peter accordingly was shipped, and thereby cut off from all communication with his sister. Annie, the cruel step-mother concluded to put under the charge of her early friend ; and by agreeing to pay the sum of two hundred pounds sterling per annum for her board and education, an arrangement was completed, and Annie was sent to G---- , to the care pf Mrs. Barton, to whom Mrs. Wallace had penned a note, and sent by Annie, the contents of which read thus: EDINBURGH, June 1, '14. DEAR MARY: I send to your care my step-daughter, who needs all the care and watchfulness you can possibly bestow upon her. I am sorry I cannot send you a more amiable charge; for it is a lamentable fact that, to enable you to do proper justice to her, it was ne- cessary that I should make you acquainted with her art, so as to prevent you from being duped' by her well-acted amiability which hides an artful, wicked heart. Knowing these facts, you will treat her with that severity that such a character requires; and- ad   THE STRANGER.           9 by all means prevent her from making any acquaintances, es- pecially of males. , Please attend to all these directions, and oblige, Your affectionate friend, JANE WALLACE. MRs. DR. BARTON. By this letter it will be readily observed that Annie was not likely to make a very favorable impression upon her new friends, so successful had her artful and wicked step-mother been in-con- cocting a hypocritical missive that would lead the Barton family to believe that her natural sweetness and amiability of disposition were all art--put on-acted for the purpose of deception. But, in spite of all these unfavorable circumstances, Annie being unaware of the character that had been given her, deter- mined to be happy-being glad to escape from the presence of her mother, and thinking that she could not, by possibility, get into worse hands thaw those from which she had just escaped. Having now given some account of the cause that resulted in Annie's being sent to G-  , we will leave her to the rest which she sought immediately after taking her tea, and, in another chapter, introduce Mrs. Wallace, her cunning persecutor. A,.     CHAPTER     II, THE BROTHER AND SISTER. IN Edinburgh, the city of palaces, fronting on the Royal Circus Place, stands a handsome marble mansion, a portion of the estates left by Captain Wallace, The establishment, as it then stood, was under the control of the late captain's widow, who strove to keep up the style of his household. e Oni the morning of which we write, the gay lady, in a luxuri- ously furnished apartment of this house languidly reclined in a large easy-chair. Her small foot was perched upon the fender, while her head rested upon her hand; in this position she dis- closed to advantage the graceful arch of her snowy neck. Her hair was of that light auburn color,-so common to those of Scottish birth; her eyes were of that mild, heavenly blue that we sometimes meet with in the course of a long life. 'Her skin was pure and fair, and a sweet smile sat almost continually upon her lips; and, from the general sweet expression of her counte- nance, few would judge correctly in regard to her disposition, for it hardly seemed possible that so much covetousness and malice could be veiled by such sweet smiles. For some time the lady sat thus indulging in sweet or bitter meditations; nor would there be much risk in adding, that she was meditating some deep scheme portending mischief to some one, when suddenly the door opened, and Robert, her brother, entered the room. "Good-morning, Jane," said he, "good-morning; you seem to be lost in thought of most heavy import; but I should hope not, for it is not well for timid woman to cloud the brightness of her life by devoting her time to the analysis of grave and   THE  EROTHL it AND SISTER.       1  knotty subjects, lest she, in place of her sweet smiles, should acquire the scowl of the erudite professor." "Never fear, Robert," replied the widow, " that I shall ever become lost in such thoughts as keep you in such an irritable humor generally." "Well, my dear, I hope you never may; but, as my time is precious this morning, I wish you would make known the import- ant business you mentioned in the note you sent me." The widow rose from her seat, and, going to a massive book- case that stood in a recess at the lower end of the room, she opened a drawer, and, taking out a letter, handed it to her brother and then resumed her seat. The brother advanced towards the window, and, placing his foot upon a small parlor stool, commenced reading the letter. After finishing it, he slowly paced the room awhile. The widow sat patiently for a few moments, hoping the professor would speak; but, seeing he continued silent, she said: '4 Well, Robert, what do you think of that letter? Is it not a remarkably strange one? Froim whom do you think it came? I never heard my husband mention Miss Noria Appolonia Pasqual. I remember once having seen the name of Gomez Pasqual in a memorandum, but I never thought anything of it." "Well, I tell you what, Jane," answered her brother, "it is my belief that this Miss Noria Pasqual is some relative of your husband's former wife, who, knowing that he was possessed of a large estate, and having heard of his death, wishes to become possessed of the persons of the children, and thus eventually become owners of the immense property left them by their kind father." During the remarks of the brother, the countenance of Mrs. Wallace underwent various changes; even virtuous indignation was expressed in her hypocritical face, and, as soon as her feel- ings would permit, she burst out in a regular tirade against the: interested strangers. "Why, the idea, Robert," she said, "for those foreigners to pretend to any claims to that property! the hypocritical things,     1 2        ANNIE WALLACE. to dare say that they would be murdered by our Scottish climate! They had better be murdered, then, in preference to being the victims of sordid, calculating strangers. Why, I think it is the very height of presumption." It is hard to tell how long the exasperated step-mother would have continued her abuse, had she not been interrupted by her brother, who remarked that he must be off, if she did not come right down to business.      l "Go, then!" said the now furious lady, "if you will see strangers rob your sister of her estates, and you not even lejnd your advice to save them." "Yes, Jane, I am willing to lend more than my advice. I will lend my personal aid, if you require it; but, if I have anything to do with this lffair, I must have all, and then I can safely pro- mise you, that(I will put an end to the hopes and doubts of those presumptuous strangers, as you call them." "They are base strangers, and, more than that, they are for- eigners," said the widow.  "Well, Jane," answered the brother, "will you leave it all to me?"  "I will, Robert," replied the widow, "on one condition; that is, that you tell me now, the means you intend to take, and pro- mise to do it immediately-this very day." "I can do that," said the brother, " by writing to inform this Miss Noria Pasqual that Mr. Wallace and both of his children are dead. You can see, Jane, that there will be no harm in this deception, as by so doing, I will save you much importunity, trouble, and irritation, and also secure to my wards sure posses- sion of their fortunes." "Deception!" said she, "it is not deception, for they are dead to them; they shall be, if I can manage it, and I do not doubt my ability, with your cooperation, my dear brother." "Well, Jane, I must go." "But you will be sure and attend to this to-day." "I will," he replied: "it shall start for Liverpool in the first mail; but it will be a long time ere they get it-but adieu."    THE RIDE.           13 Good-bye, brother; to-morrow I wish to see you." And thus the brother and sister parted-he to attend to his duties at the University, and she to caress her darling child, for whom, by a life of deceit, hypocrisy, and injustice, she was intending to win a fortune. CHAPTER    III. THE RIDE. DR. BARTON'S house was situated about a quarter of a mile from the town, and, by its commanding position, was visible from almost any point. About fifty yards west of the house, there was a road, which ran in a kind of northwest direction, and terminated in a beautiful forest about two miles from the house. This road had been pointed out to Annie, as the one she was to follow upon her equestrian excursions. Thus, the next morning, after her scramble over the wall, when returning home with Dr. Barton, we see her standing on the piazza, fronting the lane, while Billie combs out the mane of a beautiful white palfrey. Annie was dressed in a blue merino riding-habit, and a pretty blue velvet ridipg-hat. She was lean- ing against one of the posts that supportd the roof of the piazza, patting the head and stroking the mane of her fiery little pony with the silver handle of her riding-whip. "Whoa, Nep, whoa; there Billie, that will do." "Then ye dinna want any help," said Billie. "No, no; let him go," replied Annie. And, placing her foot in the stirrup, she vaulted into the saddle. Raising herself once or twice, she arranged her dress, and, walking Nep to the road, gave him a smart tap with the whip. The pony pranced once or     "        ANNIE WALLACE. twice, and then started off like a bird. Annie kept her seat with the firmness of a dragoon lading a charge, and by her easy mnanagement of 'the rein, prooed herself to be a good horse- woman. It was a beautiful morning; the freshness of the atmosphere imparted strength and vigor to Annie's frame; her spirits seemed to increase with every bound, and, ere she had ridden a mile, she cared little for her step-mother's machinations and persecutions. Away she flew over the damp road, and the only thing that' could have added to her happiness would have been a gay com- panion, who could ride as well, and laugh as well. Thus she galloped on for another mile, when she entered the woods. As soon as she got beneath their dark shade, she checked the speed of her horse, and, at last bringing him down to a leisurely walk, she dropped the reins upon his neck, and soon became lost in listening to the birds. Annie was passionately fond of flowers, and often had she received an ugly scratch in trying to get some bud that had attracted her eye. As she rode deeper into the woods, she observed that flowers, ws well as birds, :were among the beauties that surrounded her, and, seeing one that struck her as being uncommonly beautiful, she slipped her foot out of the stirrup, intending to stop her pony in order to dismount. But just at that moment her steed- was startled by a rustle among the branches; sheering suddenly asdle, and making a frantic plunge, he threw Annie from the sad- dle with .reat fSrce, against a large oak that stood beside the road. The Miling of Annie startled still more the frightened steed, and, giving a desperate leap, he started off a riderless run- away, while Annie lay pale and senseless in the road, with a crimson stream oozing from her temple. Ntep, the frantic pony, increased his speed at every bound, when suddenly a gentleman, dressed in a green hunting suit, sprang from a thicket, and, seizing the maddened beast by the bridle, held him firmly, though the beast struggled hard to get free. . Fortunately he was in strong, ,fearless hands that evidently knew what to do under the circumstances; and soon poor Nep   TI E RIDE.           15 became as gentle as a lamb, though he still continued to cast fearful glances on either side of the road. The gentleman led him back. over the road he had just traversed with lightning speed, his countenance pale with: fear; his heart beat rapidly, and his bosom was compressed with dread, not knowing the damage that had been done.             As he turned a curve in the road, his worst fears were realized; for there lay the form of Annie, to all appearance lifeless. Rapidly fastening Nep to a tree, he hastened to her: the moment he felt her pulse he was relieved; for though fainf, still it beat. With life there was hope. In his bewilderment he cast his eyes about him for water, but saw none, and his heart failed; when suddenly he bethought himself of his braindy-flask.  Supporting her head with one arm, with, the other hand he drew his flask from his pocket, and, drawing the cork, he poured some of its contents into his hand and bathed her forehead. In a few mo- ments she began to show signs of life, when he put the flask to her lips and made her drink.: She opened her black eyes, which were met by a pair as dark ks her own. The young man drew his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the blood from her face. Gradually she revived enough to attempt to rise, when he asked her if she felt much pain. She replied, "No," but said she felt weak, and would like to sit up. He raised her up, and sat her back against a tree, when, in spite of her fear and pain, she managed to take a look at the person who had rendered her such timely assistance. She saw in him a tall, elegantly formed young gentleman, with a complexion as fair as a lady. His eyes were black, even to a glittering brilliancy, while his forehead was high and lofty, and shaded by dark auburn hair. After satisfying her curiosity, Annie, who was one of those happy buoyant spirits who forget the darkness as soon as the light appears, immediate- ly cast off any feeling of depression on acchunt of the accident, and, looking timidly in the face of the stranger, laughingly in- quired, "Did you rescue me from that fractious beast, or did I tumble off?"     16         ANNIIEi WALLACE. "To say truth," answered the young man, "it was neither the one nor the other, you were thrown off." "H umph!" said Annie, "' then I am glad of it; for now I will not be under the necessity of feeling that I owe my life to a young stranger, who chancedl to rescue me in a fainting condition from an ugly beast." "Well, that is rather hard," replied the stranger, " to be de-. prived of all credit, when it is due, from such a fair being. Your champing steed there, required considerable strength to bring him -to his duty, and that brandy-flask, with my assistance, opened those bright eyes."  "Oh, I don't mean to say," replied Annie, " that you do not deserve any credit; for you have acted very kindly and nobly, and I feel very thankful, but to tell the truth, I do not think my feel- ing of thankfulness will diminish any if you will just please to help me mount my horse." "Do you feel able to ride :?" he asked. "Oh, yes," said Annie, "and I cannot see as I could do any- thing else if I did not."  "I can send for. my uncle's carriage, if you will permit me." "Oh, no," replied Annie, c" this is only a scratch, and it is not the first one I have received in reaching to get a flower; but please lend me your arm, and I will rise." The stranger assisted Annie to rise, and led her to her horse, which she mounted with considerable nerve after her recent fall. As soon as she had all arranged, she turned to the young stran- ger and said:  "If you should ever come to G----, if you will call at Dr. Barton's, Iwill try to be more profuse in my thanks." Saying this, and giving her horse a pat with her whip, she started off on an easy canter,; while the young gentleman stood in the road, blooding over what had just passed, and thinking what a handsome, but mischievous kind of being Annie was. After watching her until she had disappeared from sight, he returned to where he had left his gun and gameaag, anil, taking them up, pursued his path homeward; while Annie rode on, feel- ^.   THE RIDEo.           17 ing no other inconvenience from her late accident than a slight headache. "What a handsome fellow he was," she said to herself, as she ; cantered along. "I wonder who he can be. Mercy i I hope hie will not accept of my invitation, and call and see me. What in the world will Mrs. Barton say to my making acquaintances! I don't care, though, I will have who I please; but I am not very anxious for that fellow to come, though he is good-looking, too." And, with this rambling turn of thought, she reached home.  .       v The doctor had just dismounted, as Annie rode up to the door; Annie commenced immediately to tell the doctor of her escape, and, as soon as they got into the house, he led her to his laboratory to dress her bruises. Mrs. Barton came into the room, knowing that something was the matter, and as she entered the door, she inquired: "What has happened to you, Miss Wallace?" "Nothing, ma'anS," replied Annie, "except a slight bruise, the result of falling off Nep." "If you cannot ride, miss, you had better not mount your horse," said Mrs. Barton. "Oh!" answered Annie laughingly, "'if I minded a few bruises or frights, I should not do a great many things I am in the habit of doing; but I'll trust to my riding after this, and if I get another fall, it will be when horse and rider go together."' "Well, I suppose you will do as you please," said Mrs. Bar- ton; and, without offering any consolation or tendering any assistance, she left the room. The dinner-bell rang before Annie had changed her riding- habit. Catching her dress up, she started up stairs, and nearly fifteen minutes elapsed before she had completed her change. Annie's delay excited the wrath of Mrs. Barton, who, when she came down, addressed her rather harshly as she entered the room. "I would be better pleased, Miss Wallacef you would time your rides, so as to be home at a proper hour for dinner."     1s         AXNIE .WALLACE. "You must scold Nep, then, forhe is the guilty one; he/hav- ing unseated me very unceremoniousl        / Airs. Barton said nothing more, but to& her Eea table. Her children were a noisy set. Thomas, ne of her sons, in par- ticular, was fond of making himself hearl, to the discomfort of all the elder persons present. After eating for some time in silence, Thomas, who was, with all his disagreeable forwardness, an intelligent boy, inquired if Annie had any remembrance of India. Annie replied, that she had a very slight remembrance of a dark lady that she used to call mamma; more-than that, it was all a blank to her. "Do you not know any of your mother's relatives?" asked Dr. Barton. "I have no relatives living, on my mother's side," answered Annie. "I was told, some years ago, that they were all dead; and, as my father never mentioned any, I supposed that it was true." "You supposed that it was true," said Mrs. Barton, emphasiz- ing the word supposed, thinking that she meant her step-mother had told her so. 4 "I did not insinuate that," replied Annie; " for I know very little of my step-mother." With such general conversation, the meal was finished. After dinner Annie slipped on her bonnet, and invited Thomas Barton to accompany her in a walk to the town. Tom bounced up stairs after his cap, and came rushing down again-quite elated at being asked to accompany Miss Wallace. Taking a small basket of niceties with them, they left the house and walked towards the town. At the foot of the lane stood a small house, owned by a poor widow. Annie knocked at the door, when some one answered from within in an irritated tone of voice, "Wha's there?" "It's I," answered Annie. In a moment the door was opened, and the old woman, seizing her by the hand, cordially invited her in. "An' how are ye, my leddie," said the old woman, " and your-   THE 'MEETING.          19 self, too, Master Tom, an' ho w is the doctor an' his wife? an' I hope ye may a' be we'el." ;"Very well, indeed," replied Annie. And, after sitting a while with the old lady, she gave her some of the little extras out of her basket, for which she received many thanks. Thus they spent the whole afternoon (as she often did) in administering to the poor. She visited the sick, and would never hesitatea moment when their beds required smoothing, but, with a sweet smile upon her face, with her own hands ministered to them and arranged things nicely. When Annie returned home she found Mrs. Barton in no bet- ter humor, and, after drinking her tea, in silence, she retired to her room. CHAPTER    IV, THE MEETING. THE morning after, her adventure Annie rose, feeling very sad; and, after the morning meal, she repaired to the parlor, and, seating herself at the piano, sought to relieve her gloom with music. The thrilling tones of the instrument soon dispelled the feel- ing of depression that she experienced. Tired of sitting in the house, she went out upon the back piazza, and called Billie. In a few minutes Billie appeared with a milk-pail in his hand. Annie ordered him to saddle Nep, as she wishe4 to take a ride. It did- not take Billie long to saddle hMm up; and as Annie reappeared with her riding-whip in er hand, Billie led up the v horse. She vaulted on his back in the same manner as she had done the day previous, and a few minutes afterwards she might have been seen, as before, dashing down the road at a flying '?     20         ANNIE WALLACE. pace. At this rate she proceeded nearly a mile and a half, when she espied a horseman mounted on a prancing bay steed, coming towards her. One glance informed Annie that he was the gallant young gentleman connected with the previous day's adventure. As he advanced, he gracefully raised his cap, and reined up his horse at her side. "Good-morning," said he. "I was just about to ride over  and inquire concerning your health after yesterday's accident. You look well enough, and I should judge you had not experi- enced much injury." "Oh, very little," replied Annie; she, too, having checked her steed. "I will assure you, Miss-excuse me, but what name shall I add. Yesterday you invited me to call, but did not tell me for whom to inquire." Annie smiled as she answered, "You must excuse me, sir; I was in such a hurry, and so very much excited under the circum- stances, that I hardly know what I did say." As she said this she handed him her card. He looked at it for a moment, and seemed to be trying to recall something, as he read it over audibly, when, looking up brightly, he said, "Have you a brother, Miss Wallace, a midshipman on board of his majesty's ship ' Wemberton?'" "I have a brother," replied Annie, ( who is a midshipman, but upon what ship I do not know." "Is his name Peter," said the gentleman. Yes," answered Annie, eagerly; "do you know him?" "Not particularly, Miss Wallace," he replied; "but I know there is such a person on board-a fine manly fellow, who is in favor with all." "Well, sir," said Annie, "you might have been honored, no doubt, had you improved your acquaintance and became more intimate with him. And now, sir, as I have been so condescend- ing as to give you my card, will you ptase to return the compli- ment by handing me yours; and I shall surely let you know if I   X/         ,THE MEETING.          21 discover that I am acquainted with any one that bears your honorable name." . The young gentleman passed over his card. In the mean time he had turned his horse's head, and they were walking their steeds on a slow walk, side by side. Annie glanced at his card, and read: "Henry Monteith, First Surgeon on Board his Majesty's Ship ' Wemberton.'" "Quite a pretty name," remarked Annie. "I don't know about its being pretty," replied the young Scotchman, proudly; " but it is an honorable name, and it is my sole earthly ambition to be worthy of it." "Quite a laudable aim," said Annie. At that moment they came to a cross-road. Annie stopped her horse, remarking that she had intended to take one of these roads when she started, and, therefore, she hoped he would not feel himself slightec if she turned off. "Of course I cannot feel slighted," replied Mr. Monteith, "as I cannot claim to be a friend, or even an acquaintance; but, if you will permit, it will afford me much pleasure to accompany you on your ride; and if I am not even an acquaintance now, I may become a friend." "But suppose I am an unbeliever in friendships," replied Annie; "still it would, doubtless, afford me equal pleasure should you accompany me." With that they turned up one of the cross-roads heading east- ward, and for a few moments rode on in silence, when Mr. Mon- teith abruptly inquired if Annie's father was in Scotland at that time. Annie replied that she had neither father nor mother, and her countenance fell as she spoke. Mr. Mionteith, seeing that the subject was painful, and aroused unpleasant recollections kindly reverted to another, by inquiring if Annie studied with Mrs. Barton. "I came there," said Annie, "with the ostensible purpose of studying; but I cannot call myself much of a student. There is very little that interests me in the studies she lays the most stress upon, which are chemistry, geometry, and the laAguages.     22         ANNIE WALLACE. The languages are not so tedious as the others; but I do not like them half as well as I do my botany and history. My botany explains to me the concealed points of the beautiful in nature, while my history gives me an insight into character--thus, you see, I am quite a philosopher. I love nature for its lessons of faith; and in an account of heroic self-denial, I read moral lessons." "t Though I admire the taste for botany in others," said Mr. Monteith, " still I cannot say that I myself have any taste for it. I like to see a pretty flower, but in smelling one I experience a feeling of want which leaves me unsatisfied. In history I find constant delight, and love to dwell upon some of the traits that distinguish the character of that poor ill-used exile of St. Helena. I read a nobleness that I wish to emulate." (' Oh," exclaimed Annie, "Napoleon, to whom I suppose you allude, I consider one of the greatest of men, when we .consider his genius alone; but Napoleon, with all his magnificent glory, cannot claim one faint ray of that hallowed light that symbolizes the glory of the great and noble Washington." "Washington," replied Mr. Monteith, " was a man equal to the emergency of all the difficulties that. surrounded him; adid, as you say, Napoleon is hardly worthy to rest in the shade of the great American's glory. But it is my opinion that Napoleon, educated and trained under the same influences that surrounded Washington, in his early days, would have made as good a man; and with his wonderful talent, he would have been equally as great, if not a greater man." "Well," said Annie, "Napoleon had his work to perform, and Washington his; and though you may. consider it bold in a per son of my age to express such an opinion, nevertheless J th in-their different spheres, one did as much good as the othegr and the results of both of their great and mighty laborsjgshowing itself for good, even in this day." With such conversation as this they beguiled the time as they leisurely rode along. Each was surprised at the other's intelli- gence, and by the time they had ridden as far as they wished to,   THE MEETING.           23 they bid fair to become acquaintances, and, judging from appear- ances, their acquaintanceship was likely to' dissolve itself into the lasting and holy bond of friendship. On their return, they rode along at a brisker rate; the two spirited animals tired of the long check to which they had been subjected, the moment they felt a free orein, commenced going faster and faster, until they worried themselves into a regular run. The active exercise brought bright carnation tints to Annie's cheeks, and brightness to her eyes. If Mr. Monteith had thought her handsome during their leisurely trot, now, as they were going at a lively gallop, and as Annie became excited by their rapid pace, he could not   9 refrain from casting towards her glances of undisguised admira- tion. Rapidly thep flew along, and, in a comparatively short time, reached home. Mr. Monteith accompanied Annie to the door, and' assisted her to dismount. Annie being much pleased with him, invited him to remain to dinner; he would have re- - fused, but just at that moment Dr. Barton appeared, and, seeing who was with her, joined in her request, and prevailed upon him to stay. After dinner, Dr. Barton invited Mr. Monteith to join him in his cupola-room, and try one of his new cigars. Mr. Monteith would have preferred returning with Annie- to the drawing-room, but not wishing his desire known, he excused himself and went off with the doctor. After sitting patiently for an hour, listening to the doctor's good-natured talk, he threw away the remainder of his cigar, and, bidding the family adieu, departed. The retiring steps of Mr. Monteith's charger had hardly ceased to be heard, when Mrs. Barton rose and informed Annie that she wished to see her in her own room. Annie immediately followed, expecting to hear a lecture, but little prepared for the tirade that met her as soon as she entered the door of Mrs. Barton's room, who motioned her to a seat as she herself closed the door. "Miss Wallace," she commenced, " your affectionate mother put you under my charge entirely; and when you came to me, the understanding was that I should be responsible for your education and morals. Having told you this, you can readily     24         ANNIE WALLACE. perceive what a shock it must have been to me to see you ride up to the door,conversing familiarly with a strange gentleman." "Shocked!" said Annie, "I must admit myself surprised if my education and morals are in danger because of my ac- quaintance with a young gentleman, whom  you must per- ceive yourself, Mrs. Barton, is a very fine fellow. What harm can there possibly be in receiving him in your parlor, in which you are welcome at any time when he may be here?" "What harm!" said Mrs. Barton, becoming greatly excited, "what harm! why, the harm is that your association with gen- tlemen alyour age, and under the circumstances, is the height of impropriety. It is really outrageous, and I tell you, Miss Wallace, that as long as you are under my charge, you shall not continue the acquaintance." \ "Mrs. Barton," replied Annie, keeping perfectly cool, and loot at all frightened, "I have been put under your charge, as you say, for my education; but I was never before aware that you were to select my company; but even if that is the case, I,cannot submit to it. I am old enough now to know with whom I can associate, and I shall choose my own company; and if my conduct does not meet with your approbation, you can send me home." Mrs. Barton would have said more, but Annie gave her no chance: as soon as she had finished speaking, Annie retired to her own room, and remained there the rest of the day. Annie Wallace' was a young lady whose temper had never been properly controlled; and when she once became angry at any one whom she disliked, she was not apt to limit her remarks to what would be called strictly proper. We do not wish our readers to understand by this that Annie was possessed of a hate- ful disposition, still she was very quick tempered; but the mo- ment her anger passed, she readily became reconciled, and would, in an humble manner, ask the forgiveness of the person at whom she had been angry. Henry Monteith, the young gentleman with whom our readers have become partially acquainted,- was the only son of the hon-   THE ACCIDENT.           25 ored William Monteith, who was a man of immense wealth, which he acquired in India. The Monteiths, for many genera- tions, had been chief foresters to that branch of the Douglas and Angts family, who were the Dukes and Earls of Queensbury. They had had the sole charge of the forests from the time of Annie, Duchess of Monmouth, to that of Duke, Willie, the last of this princely house. One of his ancestors, Dr. James Mon- teith, was physician to Catharine, the fi/st Empress of Russia, and the same that Byron mentions as having poisoned Peter the Great. The ship to which Henry was connected, being in port, he had left her and returned home to stay a few weeks. During his stay, he came to G--  to pay a visit to his maternal uncle; and while there, as related in the preceding chapter, he became acquainted with Annie. CHAPTER      V. THE ACCIDENT. IN the last chapter, we left Annie in her room, brooding over the interview she had just had with Mrs. Barton. That even- ing, when she entered the tea-room, her eyes were swollen with weeping, and she looked more than she said. In silence the meal passed: Annie again sought her room. The next morn- ing, when she appeared at breakfast, all traces of the previous day's unpleasantness had vanished. Thus Annie's life passed, with nothing except the small irrita- tions that attend life to disturb the brightness of her day- dreams. Annie, in spite of the constant annoyances of Mrs. Barton, received and encouraged the frequent calls of Henry Monteith. She liked him for his honorable traits, 'ombined 3                 d '     26         ANNIE WALLACE. with a gentlemanly demeanor, which made him a very agreeable and pleasant acquaintance. And he, though not weak enough to yield his heart to the first young lady that pleased his eye, could not help admiring her disposition, with all her faults. Annie was not perfect, .by any means; on the contrary, she was very faulty: yet the fountain was clear-her heart was pure, and also her thoughts. She was a person possessed of strong feelings; where she hated, she bated with her whole heart; when she loved, her whole being became wrapt in the, object of her affections. The person that could once win their way to Annie's heart, would have a dangerous control over her thoughts and actions. One pleasant afternoon, Annie sat out upon the piazza read- ing, when a groom rode up to the door, dismounted, and, coming towards her, put a note in her hand. Annie laid aside her book to read it. While reading, her color changed a little; but, requesting the groom to wait, she went to her room and penned a reply. The note she had received was from Henry Monteith, and read thus:  DEAR MSS WALLACE: "An order, I have just received from the ship, will prevent me from keeping my engagement with you this afternoon; but to-morrow I will be very happy to accompany you. My inability to do so to-day caused me great disappointment. Please return an answer by bearer, and believe me '"Your friend, *"HENRY MONTEITH." Annie replied to 'the note, as desired, saying that, of course, she could not refuse to postpone the engagement; and, hoping that the weather would permit, she appointed the same hourifor the next day. After tea that evening, Annie went up into the drawing-room, when Thomas Barton came running towards her, and inquired if she had heard the news. "No," replied Annie, carelessly, not thinking that it was very important.   THE ACCIDENT.           27 "Mr. Monteith is dead," said Thomas. "Mr. Monteith dead!" repeated Annie, turning pale. "Yes," answered Tom, " he was killed this afternoon in a duel, by an officer who belonged to the same ship." Annie was greatly shocked at such news; it seemed almost impossible that Mr. Monteith, so full of life and gaiety when she -saw him last, could now be a cold and lifeless corpse. That night she lay in her bed, and in vain attempted to close her eyes in sleep. "Oh!" said she, giving expression to her thoughts, "can it-oh, can it be possible that Mr. Monteith is dead! Yesterday, he was talking in the full vigor of life and health. His spirit beamed out from his magnificent black eyes; and even this morning he was alive and well, and niow-he is dead!  Oh, how sudden, how dreadful! he fell in a duel; and there he must have laid, a lifeless corpse; and there stood the coarse, vulgar crowd, gazing upon the disfigured face of that noble and once handsome being-gayer and livelier than them all." To try to sleep was vain; continually the form of Henry Monteith would be present to her imagination; and again she heard him say: "Can you leap that, Miss Wallace?"   Then that mental mirror would exhibit him, stretched upon the damp turf in the agonies of death. Dreadful was that night to poor Annie; and oh! how gladly she welcomed the first ray of morning light; and when the sun appeared, Annie arose, and came down into the parlor. No one in the house having risein the roojns appeared gloomy in the dim morning light. Annie seated herself by one of the windows, to wait until some one else should come down. Annie, with all her general appearance of thoughtlessness, had a deeper current of feeling and thought; she knew that she was interested in the death of Mr. Monteith, yet her good sense told her, only as a friend. She admired his quiet, noble nature. In time, she might have loved him; but now she did not; her heart told her so; and her heart was right. Yet Annie felt that she had lost a companion; a   friend, in whom, upon a more intimate acquaint- ance, she might have confided. Though the death of Mr. Mon-     28         ANNIE WALLACE. teith could not be considered a deep sorrow to her, still it left her sad. Later in the morning, but still before breakfast, Annie deter- mined to go down into the town and see Mistress Stoddart. Slipping on her bonnet, she started out, and (soon reached the house of the old crone. Mistress Stoddart was sitting at her door, and seeing Annie coming towards the house, she raised herself, and taking up her staff went to meet her. "Good-morning, Mistress Stoddart," said Annie, as soon as she was within speaking distance, " good-morning." "Good-morning to ye, my leddie," replied the old woman, "an' ye look as though ye hae muckle trouble, so worn and pale ye look." "Oh, no, I have no particular trouble, yet I feel rather tired. I have been out for a walk," answered Annie, not wishing to let the widow discover the real cause of her paleness. "An' what brought ye towards the hame o' Mistress Stod-' dart?" "Oh," answered Annie, "I thought I would come and see'if you knew any of the circumstances attending the death of Mr. Monteith." "The death o' Mister Monteith!" exclaimed the widow, "an' who tould ye that the young gintleman was dead?" "Thomas Barton," replied Annie, feeling relieved at the doubt expressed by Mistress Stocldart of the truth of the report. "Weel, then," replied the widow, "Master Thomas tould ye wrang. Master Monteith was down to the town wi' a friend frae the ship, an' they twa were looking at a pair o' pistols that hae been sent this way, when one went off an' wounded, but dinna kill, the gintleman." "Pshaw! is that all," said Annie. "An' ain't that enouch,' said the widow, in surprise. "Oh, yes," answered Annie, " it is bad enough, but then it is not so dreadful as I was led to believe ;" and giving Mistress Stoddart a piece of silver, Annie returned home to breakfast, feeling much relieved, and quite sorry that she had not slept.   THE ACCIDENT.           29 At breakfast the conversation turned upon the recent accident. Thomas, it seems had been in the town a Fhort time after the occurrence, and, having heard the first report wihout stopping to ascertain its truth, hastened home and informed Annie, as related. During the forenoon a young gentleman-called with a note from Henry, stating the particulars, which corroborated the statement of Widow Stoddart. He expressed much regret in having to ex- cuse himself a second time. Annie returned an answer, saying, --after expressing her sympathy-that she was glad it had been no worse, and she hoped that he would soon be sufficiently re- covered to call in person, and report himself. Annie, since her acquaintance with Mr. Monteith, had paid little attention to her studies ;, therefore, the remainder of the day she devoted to study and her music. The following morning, which was Sunday, Annie arose, refreshed and free from all de- pression. Her feelings were well suited to the day, which was mild and balmy. A holy calm seemed to rest upon everything, and serenity sat upon each brow. There was to be a great assembling of the villagers upon this day, as the late pastor of the parish church had died upon the previous Friday, and his funeral sermon was to be preached in the church. Annie accompanied the Barton family. At an early hour they were seated in their pew, waiting for the services to commence. Presently the funeral cortege arrived. The coffin was borne upon a bier, which they carried into the church, and set down before the pulpit. The officiating clergyman arose, and, after briefly alluding to the circumstances attending his death, gave out an appropriate hymn. After the singing, an  aged cleigyman arose and offered a solemn prayer, and then gave out the following short but sublime and beautiful text: "Jesus wept." From this text, long,'earnestly, and solemnly did that man of God speak, and many were there in that assembly that felt what he said, and carried it home to their own hearts. Annie was seldom wont to listen to sermons; but to this     30         ANNIE WALLACE. earnest appeal she could not turn a deaf ear. She listened with eager attention until he hacd finished; she saw him stand at the grave; and again heard his voice and parting benediction, when, with a solemn heart, she returned home. The remainder of the day Annie spent in reading, meditating, and studying her own heart. CHAPTER VI. THE RETURN. ABOUT two months after the incidents related in- the last chap- ter, Annie one day sat at the parlor window, looking carelessly out upon the landscape. Presently she saw a horseman riding towards the house. At first she paid no attention to the rider when, just as she was turning away, she recognized the charger that Mr. Monteith generally rode. A second glance informed her that the rider was Mr. Monteith himself. A momentary thrill ran through Annie; her heart seemed to be struggling up in her throat; but, by an effort, gaining control of herself, she ran out upon the piazza to greet him. During Mr. Monteith's sickness, Annie had sent two or three times to inquire concerning his improvement; but, independent of these open inquiries, she had daily made herself cognizant of his progress through Mistress Stoddart. Though she had ex- pected that he would be able to ride in a few days, still nothing could have surprised her more than to see him at this time. As Mr. Monteith dismounted, he inquired of Annie how she had been since he last saw her. "Very well, Mr. Invalid," answered Annie; "but I think you might have waited until I had asked you that question." "Oh, I am very well now," replied Mr. Monteith, " consider-   THE RETURN.           31 ing how ill I have been. But, Miss Wallace," he continued, "'I have at last been able to get here for the purpose of taking the promised ride. I hope you will overlook my past transgres- sion in the non-fulfillment of nmy old appointment." "I cannot decide immediately whether to excuse you oi not," answered Annie; " for I hardly know how it will do to encourage young gentlemen that break their appointments under the plea of business." "Indeed," laughingly answered Monteith, "I thought it would be so romantic to shoot myself accidentally, and excite a young lady's sympathy by my fortitude and patience, and thus, through her aroused sympathy, win my way to her heart." "Well, sir," replied Annie, trying to look terrifically serious. "I will just iiform you that my heart is not susceptible .to such tragic fortuitous impressions." "A truce for the present, cried Mr. Monteith, " while I ask you again if you will excuse me, and allow me to redeem my promise by accompanying you upon a horseback excursion." "I think I will go," answered Annie; and, after inviting Mr. Monteith into the parlor, she ordered Nep to be addled, and retired to assume her riding-habit. In- a few -minutes she reap- peared, equipped for riding.. As she entered the parlor, she observed Mr. Monteith carelessly turning the leaves of a book. As Annie came into the room he laid aside his book, and requested her to sit down at the open piano and favor him with some music. Annie readily complied, and sang two or three pieces. Mr. Monteith was all attention; and so rapt was he, that when Annie spoke to him, he did not heed her, and she had to repeat her question. "Mr. Monteith," said she, '; will you please accompany me in this piece?" "O, excuse me," he answered, suddenly recollecting himself, "did you address me, Miss Wallace?" "I did, sir," replied Annie; " but you seem to be in a medi- tative mood. Will you sing with me?" "I am in earnest, Miss Wallace, when I assert that if I ever     32         ANNIE WALLACE. possessed any talent for music, it was never cultivated, and I hardly know one note from the other." "I can vouch for your ear," rejoined Annie, (" if a passion for music is any criterion; for you were so absorbed in listening, that I had to speak twice before being heard."     0 The servant at this moment announced the horses ready, and Henry, offering his arm to Annie, assisted her to mount; then t  quickly vaulting upon the back of his own beast, they rode off. Mrs. Barton stood at one of the upper windows, watching them as they cantered off, until a curve in the road shut them from her sight. Turning away, she muttered: ' I'll put a stop to this, Miss Wallace, by sending you back to' Edinburgh ;" and immediately she penned a note to her former friend, Mrs. Wallace, informing her, that Annie had formed an intimacy with a young gentleman, which seemed to be daily in- creasing. "So fond," wrote she, "are they of each other's society, that every pleasant afternoon some out-door excursion is planned. When the weather is unfavorable," continued she, "Mr. Monteith rides over, and spends the afternoon listening to Annie's music, and talking about-I know not what."          t In the evening, when Annie returned, Mrs. Barton met her at the hall-door, with the same ominous look that she had worn upon a former occasion. She motioned Annie to her own room, and informed her that she had dispatched a letter to her step-mother, with a request to send and bring her home, as she, Mrs. Barton could feel herself no longer responsible for Annie's intimacy with Mr. Monteith. Annie replied she was glad she had written, and was ready to start for Edinburgh at any moment. Every day after the above conversation with Mrs. Barton, Annie watched anxiously for a letter. Three weeks elapsed, and - no answer came; but, on the following Tuesday morning, Thomas came into the house with two letters-one for Annie, and one for Mrs. Barton. Annie broke the seal of her letter with the inten- tion of perusing it immediately, but was interrupted by Mrs. Barton, who had been more expeditious in reading. She came towards Annie with the open letter in her hand, and said:   THE RETURN.           33 "Excuse me, Miss Wallace, for interrupting you, but I have just received a letter from your mother; she expresses much sorrow at your imprudence and desires that you will be sent immediately home. You will, therefore, complete your arrange- ments so as to start to-morrow morning, and what you cannot readily pack will be sent to you." "I will be ready," answered Annie, but her lip trembled with emotion as she spoke. Annie possessed a courageous little heart, and had also, in some measure, become inured to disappointment; still the idea of again going to her step-mother filled her with dread. But there was no alternative. .Recovering herself. she finished read- ing the letter she had received and commenced making prepara- tions for her departure. In the evening, Mr. Monteith called and invited Annie to a moonlight stroll. Annie gladly accepted the invitation, hoping telt the walk, and the calm serenity of the night, would bring quiet and peace to her troubled soul. The evening was clear and beautiful; the surrounding hills and green meadows, which looked gay and pastoral in the bright sunlight, seemed now enjoying a quiet repose under the veil of silvery light cast upon them by the :entle moonhas she pursued her way, now and then partially obscured by the light fleecy clouds, which slowly passed over her disk, following each other like ships sailing in the same track. For some time they walked on in silence; both were entranced with the beauties of the night, and both were absorbed in gazing upon the multitude of objects pictured in the heavens and upon the earth, softened and im- lowed by the rays of gentle Phoebus. A weight seemed to press upon each, and neither seemed disposed to converse; but the solemnity of silence could not continue forever, and Annie- broke it by exclaiming /          --." "What a glorious night! yet I feel in each moment the oppos- ing sensations of joy and sadness."' a'  ' I, too, Miss Wallace," replied Monteith, "have experienced the same strange, contradictory emotions that you describe; but     34         ANNIE WALLACE. I did not realize my own until you spoke; yet I often have the  same feelings." "It is my opinion that if we should walk faster, we might dis- pel this undefined feeling of uneasiness by a little mo active exercise." "It shall be as you wish," replied her companion; " still, I feel very well content with this slow gait; but I am not selfish enough to wish you to share my own melancholy feelings; so let's on." "No, no, stop!" called Annie, laughing, as Mr.- Monteith started off at a quick pace, taking such strides as would have been difficult for her to keep up with. "^Come back!" she cried; and if those terrible leaps do not correct your meditative propensities, I shall consider you a confirmed melancholic." "Well now, that is too bad; but, to tell the truth, this brisk walking has caused a reaction already, and I feel ready for a run." "I protest," said Annie, " that you are the most obstinate gentleman I ever met." "Am I?" inquired Henry. "You are," replied Annie; "but I forgot to inform you, Mr. Monteith, that to-morrow I am going back to Edinburgh." "What did you say, Miss Wallace?" "That I am going home to-morrow." "Is not this unexpected, Miss Wallace?" asked Mr. Monteith, with a slight appearance of pique in his manner. "O no," answered Annie, assuming an air of indifference, "I have been expecting a letter for some time, commanding my return." A few minutes passed without any remark from either; but Mr. Monteith seemed to have relapsed again into a melancholy mood. Suddenly, he turned towards Annie and said: "You are a strange girl, Miss Wallace; I do not understand you." "You do not understand me!" replied Annie; " well, I admit I must confess to the same ignorance."   THE RETURN.            35 Mr. Mofiteith dit not notice Annie's reply, but walked silently on, exhibiting an abstracted, nervous manner, that surprised the young lady, who had always found him polite and affable in his deportment. A sudden change seemed to have taken place in his mood, and Annie wondered still more when he abruptly inquired her motive for going back to Edinburgh. Annie replied that she had no motive other than that she had been sent for. '(But, come, Mr. Monteith," continued she, "shall we not return?" "Oh no, no-eh-eh-excuse me, Miss Wallace, I shall be happy to return if you wish it." But, instead of turning, he continued to walk on, until Annie complained of fatigue, when he immediately regained' his self-possession and turned his path homeward. They conversed little on the way; but when they reached Dr. Barton's, Mr. Monteith apologized for what he termed his absent- mindedness. With X lively " good-night," they parted-Henry promising to accompany her a short distance on horseback next morning. A short time after her return, Annie retired to rest: for some time she lay casting a retrospective glance upon her past life. Annie had her peculiar misfortunes-a mother's care she had known but for a brief period, and, in later years, just as she was passing from the dew-drop years of childhood, into the more serious existence of womanhood, he, too, the kind, indulgent father, was lost to her. In this, her backwaid view, she beheld but few joys that were not dimmed by bitter recollections; each remembered event presented itself to Annie's mind, and she tossed restlessly from side to side. Annie yearned for some- thing--even in her happiest moments she would experience this feeling come over her-there was a hope of her young heart unrealized-a veil of sadness sgeted to cloud her heart's joys; yet she felt those joys were there, and it needed but the softened light of love and sympathy to illumine the dark recesses where they were buried, for them to bloom, tinged with earth's brightest colors. Annie lived in the future; she had a presentiment that all the clouds of sorrow and misfortune, that now lowered about     3 6         ANNIE WALLACE. her, would soon clear away, and that then she should fully realize the brighter visions that floated in the distance. It was near daybreak ere she sank into a troubled sleep; and, so soon as the first faint ray of morning light struggled through her window, she arose and prepared for a walk, and to view, possibly for the last time, scenes that, of late, she had often gazed upon, lost in dreamy imaginings. The sun had just shaken off the gloomy haze that floated o'er the eastern horizon, as Annie left the house. Blithely she tripped along, drawing in long breaths of the cheering, invigorating atmosphere. Each tree and flower in the well-kept garden, the shady walk and cool fountain, one and all had its share in Annie's parting adieus. For two long hours Annie wandered, reveling in the quietness and beauties of Scottish scenery, then returned just in time to eat a hurried breakfast and prepare to meet the coach. Another hour winged its way to join its predecessors-Annie was ready to start--she stood upon the piazza, looking in the direction whence she expected Mr. Monteith to appear; but he came not. There was no excuse for longer delay ;, hastily, with tears in her eyes, she bade all adieu but Mrs. Barton, -who had entered the house for some forgotten article. Annie sprang up the stoop and met her at the moment she returned. "Good-bye, Mrs. Barton," said Annie, offering her lips affec- tionately. "Good-bye, my dear," answered Mrs. Barton, in the kindest tone -of voice she had ever used towards her. Another moment Annie was in the carriage, on her way to Edinburgh. Mrs. Barton and Annie had parted as friends. Human nature, in spite of forced restraints, is sometimes true to itself; and though these two had evidently cherished a dislike for each other- acquired by the former through prejudice-still they had been associated together, and the first kind words dispelled the preju- dice of one, and won the ready forgiveness of the other-they parted friends.   CHAPTER VII, THE ISLAND OF PENANG. IN the straits of Malacca is situated a small island, the spicy breezes from which perfume the neighboring seas. The China- men, going between Liverpool and Canton, were in the habit of stopping at Penang, for the purpose of replenishing their stores, which fact- made it well known to merchants and seamen. For so small an island, its commerce was extensive. About a quar- ter of a mile from the shore stood an ancient square stone house; it had been built upon a rocky height, and was' accessible only from one point. Its advantageous situation afforded its inmates a fine view of the island; and a few miles out to sea. There were four high arched windows on each side of the house, and above each large one was a diamond-shaped window, which served to admit light into the rooms in the upper story. The entrance was exactly in the centre of the building, fronting the sea; it/opened into a spacious hall, on the right of which was a large room, used as a sitting-room ; next to this, and com- municating with it through a wide door, was a middle room, which was a general library; all around the wall shelves were placed, filled with books of every variety of binding, from the most costly to the plainest-beyond this was the tea-room. Upon the left, a parlor and drawing-room, spacious and lofty, furnished in a magnificent, but ancient style; there were kitchens and out- houses built back, showing ample accommodation for a large es- tablishment. . A broad staircase, with heavily carved balustrades, led up to the second floor, which was divided into sleeping apart- ments.  4     38         ANNIE WALLACE. The present owner of this house and plantation was a wealthy Spanish merchant. Senor Marcella, was the scion of a noble Venetian family, which, for an alleged participation in the plot of Francesca de Caracca, against the republic, had been condemned by the Council of Ten, to perpetual banishment from the Venetian territory, and that their names should be stricken from the golden book of the republic. This family took refuge in Spain, in the beautiful pro- vince of Andalusia. Here it increased and multiplied, and became Spanish in all but the name. One of the members of this family during the war of the Succession, took up arms as a guerrilla leader, in order to drive the French invaders from his native soil. In one of these expeditions he was taken prisoner, and condemned to death; but, by the intercession of friends, his sen- tence was commuted to perpetual expatriation from Spain. The exile took refuge in Penang. Seiior Jose Marcella was the last male descendant of the exiled guerrilla leader: he was a widower, with but one child-the eldest a daughter, havingheen married twice, had died, leaving three children. The seaor's re- maining child was a son, a fine, manly youth, the pride of the old man's heart. At the time we write, he had just returned from England, whither he had been to be educated by his mater- nal uncle, Sir William Crowsley. We would introduce the reader to the family of Sefior Mar- cella (which consisted of himself and widowed sister, who was childless ; his son Philip, and Noria, his plain-looking but spirited granddaughter) upon a beautiful morning in May. The atmos- phere was clear and bracing, and well calculated to invigorate an invalid. Senor Jose had just finished his morning regalia as Philip the sefnor's son strolled up towards the veranda, followed by two large Newfoundland dogs. The old man smiled proudly on his son as he lightly leaped up the stone steps. Philip was the pride and darling of his heart, and everything was subservient to the will and pleasure of the generous-hearted, impetuous youth.   THE ISLAND OF PENANG.         39 "Good-morning, my son," said the old man, as Philip came towards him. '"Good-morning, father," replied the youth. "Where have you been so early?" inquired the father. "I have been over to Aunt Isabella's,"' replied the son. "She received a letter by the British man-of-war that lays off the port; it is from those Scotlanders, and is very tartly written, saying that Captain Wallace and his two children are all dead. The writer, who signs himself R. Jamieson, adds, to dispel any doubt we maytave, that ' his property has all been disposed of according to his will.'" "Both dead!" said the old man, as a tear rolled down his dark and furrowed cheek.  "My son, it has happened just as I expected-they were murdered bythat cold, bleak, Scottish climate. My bright little Annie, whom I expected to lbe the darling of my old age, and the manly little Peter, he, too. Well, well, I hope they have found a brighter world than this :" and the affectionate old man walked sadly away. Philip watched his father for a moment, and then turned into the house; in a few minutes he reappeared, having exchanged his short riding-coat for one of more graceful proportions. Whistling to his dogs, hw sauntered down towards the Glen House, a public tavern, kept by a stout, good-natured English- man, who had formerly been a second mate on board of a vessel that stopped at Penang. Tom Aston's good sense told him that this would be a good place to establish a tavern, for the ac- commodation of officers commanding vessels visiting the port, and also for the rich gentry of the island. To this place Philip proceeded. He and Tom Aston were great friends, and Philip was always a welcome guest. As he entered the bar-room, he saw several of the junior officers belong- ing to the man-of-war which lay at anchor off the shore. Not having been introduced to them, he sat down by one of the windrows, and commenced reading an English paper that lay on one of the tables. Philip tried hard to read, but every few     40         ANNIE WALLACE. moments his attention was drawn off towards some of the other party scattered about the room. "I say, Peter," said one of the midshipmen, " it's a splendid morning for a ride." "First-rate, Dick, answered the one called Peter; "but where shall we get our horses from?" "Hire them, of course." "Very well, I'm in for it, if the whole party go in such lazy concerns as this island affords." Just at that moment they were interrupted by an exclamation from one of their number, who had carelessly spitted some tobacco juice on Philip Marcella's hand. Philip rose up, and quietly asked him if he meant anything by it, when the pugnacious midshipman told him to go to h-ll. Philip's dark eyes flashed in a moment. "You are no gentleman, sir," said he. "You are a liar," answered the passionate midshipman. "The person," said Philip, " who can use such language, I can hardly consider worth seeking satisfaction from." "Good, sir; d-m   good, sir," said the midshipman. "You iave a craven's ready wit for getting out of trouble." "And you, sir, a bully's impudence for getting into it," replied Philip.  The midshipman's face blanched with rage. Turning towards me of his companions, he said a few words, and walked away without deigning to answer Philip's last retort. Philip, seeing hat the row was likely to end there for the present, quietly esumed his seat and paper, and commenced reading, when he vas accosted by the midshipman called Peter, who inquired how he trouble commenced. Philip stated the circumstances, adding arelessly that he anticipated a challenge. His indifferent man-   { er was all assumed. Though far from being a coward, still he readed the necessity of an encounter, as such a scene, even hould it terminate in his success, would cause,much pain and orrow. The gentlemanly young midshipman that addressed Philip  '   THE ISLAND OF PENANG.         41 was much pleased with his appearance and manner and uncon- sciously he became interested in him. Addressing Philip again, he said: "Is there no chance of avoiding an encounter, and settling this amicably?" "I cannot see any chance," replied Philip. "If he challenges me I shall meet him; though it is hard that, for such a trifling circumstance society and custom demand that I should sacrifice my present and eternal peace." The young midshipman looked steadily at Philip, and said: "Sir, I will be your friend, if you will permit me to be such." "A proffer of friendship," replied Philip, '"is too precious an offering to be refused; and though we have but just met, still, as you have offered to beymy friend, I will accept you as such until I learn another of life's bitter lessons, should you deceive me." "I thank you," replied the midshipman; "and now, as an acknowledged friend, and as a first sacrifice for friendship, I require a promise from you, that you will not accept a challenge from Harry Sunderland within twenty-four hours, as he is excited with drink, and in cooler moments would not have been guilty of what has transpired. If, at the expiration of twenty-four hours, he shall not apologize, I will act as your friend in this matter, and see that fair and proper arrangements are made." Philip readily promised the midshipman who was called Peter that he would act at he desired, after which they engaged in an in- teresting conversation, when they were interrupted by a gentleman wearing the uniformi of the British navy, who handed Philip a note. Philip arose from his seat, and, without offering to take the note, inquired if it was from Mr. Sunderland. The gentle- wr n replied that it was.  (Then," said Philip, "please return it to him, and inform him that I will receive no communication from him within twenty- four hours; and if, at the end of that time, his cooler judgment     42         ANNIE WALLACE. does not convince him that he was in error, I will t ender him any satisfaction he may require."      ! The gentleman, bowing politely, returned the note to his vest pocket, and left them, to seek Harry, whom he found rapidly pacing the floor in one of the upper stories. Repeating Philip's words, he quietly lighted his cigar, and then left Harry to his own meditations.                      For some time after this interruption, Philip and his new friend, Peter, continued to converse, and finally it was agreed that Peter should get permission to spend a few days at the house of Senor Jose Marcella. Philip accompanied Peter on board. As they stepped upon the deck, Philip saw a fine elderly- looking man, towards whom Peter proceeded, and, touching his cap, asked the desired permission. The officer, who was first- lieutenant, after ascertaining with whom Peter intended to stay, readily granted permission. The young men, pleased with the lieutenant's consent, hurried to the gangway to get a seat in a boat just leaving for the shore, when the captain, who was just entering his gig, invited them to go with him. Acknowledging the honor, they took their seats in the stern, and were soon landed. Proceeding immediately to the house, they partook of the supper that was waiting for them, and then retired to Philip's room, and finally to bed. The next morning they arose with the sun, and, after taking a walk, returned, feeling more and more pleased with each other. While sitting out upon the front piazza, waiting for the breakfast- bell, Harry Sunderland's friend rode up, driven by a native, in one of the awkward conveyances of the island. Leaving the conveyance, he approached Philip, and presented him with a note, which read thus: "GLEN HOUsE, 18- "DEAR SIR: "Since calmly considering yesterday's unpleasant occurrence, I have come to the conclusion that, as a gentleman, an apology is due from me. Therefore, for any offense of which I may have   THE ISLAND OF PENANG.         43 been guilty, I here express my regret, and tender my apologies, 'in due sincerity. I will leave the appreciation of my motives for so doing to your own generosity. "Yours, "H. SUNDERLAND. "' PHLIP M[ARCELLA. "P. S.--If the above is not satisfactory, I will then render any other required. Feeling assured that I have been actuated by a sense of right apd not of fear, I still remain, Yours, "H. S." Philip read the note hurriedly, and, handing it to Peter, turned towards the bearer of the note, and said that it was perfectly satisfactory, and added, that his knowledge of'a British sailor's courage would prevent him from believing that it was prompted by fear. Harry's friend replied that he was glad it was so easily settled. "I, too, feel grateful," continued he, "for waiting twenty-four hours. Had you fought, and you been injured, Harry would never have forgiven himself; and had he fallen; one noble being would have gone broken-hearted to her grave." As the speaker finished, he entered the gari, and bid the syce return to the Glen House. As he disappeared, Peter came for- ward and congratulated Philip on the happy termination of the affair.     CHAPTER VII1. EXCURSION TO THE REEF HOUSE. HARRY SUNDERLAND'S messenger had hardly passed out of sight, when the breakfast-bell rang. The young gentleman rose immediately and proceeded to the breakfast-ro m, fully realizing the necessity of yielding to the cravings of a keen appetite. According totPhilip's request, the housekeeper had prepared a meal for them alone-Philip, for some reason, not wishing to eat at the same table with the family on this particular occasion. After doing full justice to their breakfast, they again adjourned to the piazza to enjoy the luxury of a smoke. Quietly they sat puffing away, when Philip jumped up suddenly, and said: "What do you say, Peter, for a tramp over to the Reef House?" "I say," answered Peter, " that such a tramp will mrbt my hearty approbation." "Suppose we ask a number of your brother-midshipmen to accompany us." "All right," replied Peter, "how far is it?" "About thirteen miles," said Philip, " over a circuitous and rocky road." After fully deciding to go, Peter dispatched a note to the ship, inviting a number of his companions. Eight obtained permis- sion, including three of the crew.' It was a  fine day, and the party were all in fine spirits, especially Philip, who was with inftelligent, congenial companions, such as he had often longed for. Philip and his friend walked some distance in advance of their companions. As they jogged Y^ts   EXCURSION TO THE REEF HOUSE.        45 along, Peter inquired what there was worth seeing after they arrived at the Reef House. "Nothing remarkably interesting," 9replied Philip; "there is old Madame Corrilla, the rich widow, with one of the loveliest daughters I ever beheld. Madame Corrilla," he continued, "is the widow of a French nobleman, who was lost on the reef when returning from China. His body was never recovered, and his wife came here, as she says, 'to watch for it.' She is called insane, though she kept her wits long enough to turn the most of her French property into cash. An old butler, whom she brought here with her, attends to her business; and even now, she takes great interest in adorning her house with works of art. Her furniture is the most costly ever brought to the island." "You say that she has a daughter," remarked Peter. "Yes," answered Philip, " one of the sweetest blue-eyed crea- tures I ever saw. She rides beautifully, plays splendidly, and is altogether a most charming creature." "Aha!" exclaimed Peter, "I thought you said there was no- thing remarkably interesting to see. I should think that such a beauty as you described would be an object of some interest to a party of marriagable young middies." "' Well, I hope you will like her. I cannot, on account of the strangeness which surrounds them. I can love nothing that is unnatural." "Nor I," replied Peter; "but I love romance." "Well wait until we get there, and see whether you like the romance attending their existence." Thuis merrily the happy party plodded along, passing large plantations, and sometimes stopping to gaze upon the variety of scenery which surrounded them. About noon they came in sight of the Reef House, the residence of the strange Madame Corrilla. As they marched up to the large gate, two gigantic natives came forward, and gazed curiously at the young men. Philip imme- diately led the way into the house. The door was opened by a good-looking Malay woman, who ushered them into the parlors.     "         ANNIE WALLACE. Wondering glances of astonishment were cast about the rooms at beholding such gorgeousness andc elegance, in such an out-of- the-way place. Massively carved lounges and sofas were set about the rooms, while pier and mantel-glasses were tastefully arranged. Hanging over one of the mantels was the portrait of the widow's late husband. The young men-were walking eagerly about the rooms, admiring the paintings that were hung upon the walls, when the parlor-door opened, and Madame Corrilla, with her daughter, entered. A smothered exclamation betrayed the surprise of the midshipmen, upon beholding the two beautiful beings that joined them. Madame Corrilla could not have been more than forty-five years of age. She was tall, dignified, and graceful; her carriage was easy and lasly-like; her eyes were dark, piercing, and wild, and, except their strange brilliancy, Peter could not discover anything that denoted insanity; he felt inclined to believe that Philip had been jesting with him when he said she was \ insane., Vx But, the most striking apparition was Madame Corrilla's daighter Emily.  If an angel from  heaven had suddenly alighted among them, she could not have caused greater admi- ration than did the beautiful Emily Corrilla. She was but six- teen years of age; her eyes were a dark blue, shaded, by long eyelashes; her eyebrows were delicately and beautifully arched; her form was rather small, yet gracefully developed; and, alto- gether, Emily was, in the instantaneously formed opinion of all, one of the most elegant models of beauty they had ever be- held. The mother and daughter entered the room hurriedly, and, advancing towards Philip, extended to him and his companions a hearty and cordial welcome. "Oh," said she, "I am rejoiced to see you, especially with such a number of companions. A strange craft, laying off the reef, has caused us a great deal of anxiety. But, how did you leave your father and his family?" she continued. S "I left them all well," answered Philip. "My aunt is quite   EXCURSION TO THE REEF HOUSE.        47 anxious to make a trip over here, and you must not be surprised E if she should unexpectedly intrude upon your solitude." "She, or any of your father's family, will always be welcome to my house," replied Madame Corrilla; " and, as to breaking in upon my solitude, she need not fear. You know not what pleas- ure it gives me to receive company. I dislike this isolation from the gayer scenes of life; yet, I am bound by a spell which will compel me to spend the rest of my lifR-here." While Madame Corrilla was speaking, she and her daughter seemed nervous and restless. Such behavior, Philip and Peter attributed to her state of mind, thinking that her daughter was fearful, lest she should betray to the company her lack of sense. They had either forgotten entirely, or else considered of no im- portance, the anxiety she expressed concerning the movements of the strange vessel. After remaining and conversing for some time, Madame Cor- rilla suddenly arose, and, excusing herself to the company, motioned Philip to follow her, saying that her daughter would I entertain his companions during his absence. Philip arose im- 1 mediately, and followed her out of the room. Going up one k flight of stairs, she turned into a little room on the north- west corner of the house, which commanded a view of the sea. Walking straight to the window, she raised the casement, and requested Philip to examine a strange-looking craft that was laying off the reef. It was about an hour past mid-day; a steady breeze was carrying the breakers dead high upon the  shore, making it a dangerous undertaking to attempt a landing.  Philip examined the curiously rigged vessel for a few momentt i when, turning suddenly around, he told Madame Corrilla that he I would call up his friend, who would probably know better than himself of what character she was. Philip's companions were a little surprised at Madame Corrilla's sudden exit from the room with him, but soon were engaged in  lively conversation with the beautiful Emily, when the door I opened and Philip reentered the room. He seemed considerably excited, and, motioning Peter to follow him, reascended the      stairs, leaving the others to wonder at the strangeness of his movements. Soon as they reached the upper room, he pointed out to Peter the vessel: the moment Peter cast his eye upon it, he exclaimed: "It is a pirate; we saw her from on board the ship once, but she evaded us by hugging the coast." "A pirate, did you say, sir. " inquired Madame Corrilla, look- ing horror-struck. "Yes, madame," answered Peter; " there can be no doubt of her identity; but I cannot imagine what she is anchored off the reef for." "To rob me, sir," replied the lady, in a quick, emphatic man- ner. The three continued observing the vessel for some time longer, all of them much excited.  Madame Corrilla felt a woman's personal alarm; besides, her anxiety for her property was nearly as great. Philip formed his resolution at once: his gallant nature de- cided him to remain and protect, or share the fate of the widow and her daughter. Peter, equally generous and self-sacrificing, had taken the same resolution.  For some time they stood silently gazing upon the pirate ship, when Philip turned to Peter and said: "You had better return with your companions to your ship: I shall stay with Madame Corrilla and her daughter." "I, too, shall remain," answered Peter; "I will not desert you in such peril." "I will not urge you to go, then," continued Philip, "though it may cause you some inconvenience on account of your ship; but, if they cannot find an excuse under the circumstances, I am mistaken in my judgment of a British captains gener- osity." "I'll trust to being excused," answered Peter; "but come to the parlor; we will see who else will remain." "One moment, gentlemen," called Madame Corrilla, as the young men were proceeding down the stairs. "Please send my daughter hither; I wish to retire half an hour; at the end of that   "   time, I will be with you again. In the mean time, I will pray heaven to protect and reward you."1 Peter and Philip bowed, and, when the lady had passed on, they returned to the room where they had left their companions. Inquiring looks met them as they entered, which Peter answered by briefly stating the circumstances; then added, "No doubt, gentlemen, an attack is intended-how many of you will remain with us to defend the persons and property of o0ur fair hostess A simultaneous ,!" was the answer. "I anticipated your reply," continued Peter; "and now I propose that we adjourn to the north room, and, in sight of the pirate, decide upon our course of action." They adjourned to the room designated, when it vas proposed, immediately, that Peter should be appointed their leader in the anticipated struggle.  Thanking , the for the honor, he pointed out the strange vessel to is companions, and then proposed that one of their number, or one of Madame Corrilla's dependents, should ride to the town for assistance. Turning to Philip, he inquired how long a time it would probably take to go over and return. Philip replied, it would take four or five hours , perhaps longer, as the road was rough and circuitous.  After a few momenen further consultation, it was finally de-, cided that, with Madame Corrilla's consent, one of her male servants should be dispatched to Philip's father with an account of their situation and peril. Their hostess readily consented. In a very short time he was on his way, leaving the party stand- ing in the parlor, to which they had returned immediately after deciding upon their ourse. Their messenger had hardly disap- peared from sight, ere they were startled by an exclamation from one of their number, who had remained above to watch the schooner: "They are low'ring a boat! they are low'ring a boat!" Peter called his companions, with Philip, who was to act as lieu  tenant, and  five  natives belonging to th e establishment. When collected together, he discovered that his party numbered     50         ANNIE WALLACE. fourteen able-bodied men. They were assembled in the room, and Peter standing in their midst talking hurriedly, when Mad- ame Corrilla appeared, and who said: "Gentlemen, allow me now to thank you for your good-will and gallantry, and may the sainted mother of Jesus intercede, that you may all be spared and abundantly blessed, for succoring a follower of the true faith." A hearty amen was the response to this speech of the lady, of whom Peter inquired if there were any fire-arms in the house. "O yes," she replied, " why did I not think of that before. Come with me, and I will be able to furnish you with all the arms that you need." And, leading the way to a small room in the upper part of the house, and opening the door of a large pantry, she produced muskets, cutlasses, and pistols sufficient for all but one of the party, and it was decided that the unarmed one should be general aid-de-camp to the rest. Madame Corrilla's house stood upon a rising eminence. It was built of dark stone, and was a plain, square building. The doors were of thick oak, strengthened with iron bars; and, alto- gether, the house seemed to have been erected with a view to defense. The windows were large, and Gothic-shaped, secured by strong oaken shutters, heavily barred, like the doors. A broad hall ran straight through the centre of the house; on one side a short hall branched off from the main one, from which a spiral stair-case led up to a broad platform fifteen or twenty feet in circum- ference, and, except where it branched off into other passages or rooms, was surrounded by a heavy balustrade. This platform overlooked the lower hall. The house could not be approached except from tht front; the back of. the building was directly on the cliff overlooking the sea, but some ten or fifteen feet from its outer edge. After Orming his party, and furnishing them with ammunition (which, fortunately, was plenty), he stationed two at each of the hall-doors, and one at each window; the shutters were closed and barred, and a circular opening, near the top of each, was made to serve as port-holes, by erecting platforms with the heavy arti-     cles of furniture, underneath. Disposing of his force to the best advantage, he issued all necessary directions, and then, accompa- nied by Philip and the ladies, went up stairs to watch the move- - ments of the pirates in their efforts to land. The pirates were in their boats, lying on their oars, just outside the breakers, seemingly unwilling to trust their frail barks to those white- crested waves, which were furiously driving towards the shore. There were three boats, each containing eleven persons, making, in all, thirty-three Inen. Counting their number, Peter remarked to Philip that, if the pirates were not reenforced, he thought they could hold out against them. Yes," answered Philip; , but the probability is that there are twice that number lying back in the schooner." "Well, I think we can hold out against them all, until we our- selves are reenforced; but, Philip-" Just at that moment, Peter was interrupted by a wild scream, uttered by Madame Corrilla, as one of the pirate boats, more adventurous than the rest, pulled into the breakers and landed in safety upon the beach.  Peter and his companions stood watch- ing them with intense interest, as the other two boats, encouraged by the success of their fellows, attempted to follow. Boldly they launched into the crested waters-one moment more, and they would all be safe, when an enormous wave raised one high in air, and then unshipped it, bottom upward, among the breakers. The little party in the room became still more intensely excit- ed, glorying in. the catastrophe that would probably lessen the number of their enemies. But, more eager still was the motley -group that stood upon the beach, as they watched their fellows manfully struggling with the waves.  Finally, all but two gained the shore; those two ill-fated mortals sank to rise no more, almost in the act of lawless murder and robbery. They were snatched from earth, and hurried into the presence of an offended God, without one moment for repentance. When the'waves rose high above them, they cried for the mercy they had so often scorned; but it was too late-the eleventh hour had passed, and they were now where their destiny was fixed foi eternity.    t '; CHAPTER     IX. I THE ATTACK BY PIRATES.  AN hour was occupied by the pirates in landing and recovering .f; their boats; but, as soon as all were collected together on the ,  beach, one, who appeared to be their leader, addressed them for ; . a few moments. The pirates seemed to be aware that the house -  was to be defended, but, by how great a force, they were, neces- sarily, ignorant.  Apparently after arranging their plan of attack, they formed '. into three divisions, and marched in regular order towards the  house.  -                         t ' Peter and Philip, leaving the ladies to keep a look-out, went round to each of the windows, ordering each of the volunteer guard to have their pieces cocked, and stand ready to change their position at any moment. Boldly the mixed crew of China- ; men, Malays, and Europeans advanced toward the front of the i house, with the apparent intention of making a grand rush at ; p the front door. Steadily they came on, and were within three feet of the piazza, when Peter sang out to them in a clear, firm voice: "Hold, there, strangers! advance another step at your peril, until you give proof that you come with peaceful intentions." The pirates came to a sudden halt, when their leader replied, in tolerable English,                    /' "We come as friends, and only wish to purchase provisions." "Why, then, do you come armed?" said Peter. "For self-defense," answered the pirate.        [: : "Against whom," inquired Peter; "the women?" "Will you permit us to enter peaceably," inquired he who jA seemed to be their captain; " or shall we force an entrance "    THE ATTACK BY PIRATES.         53 "'"Pon my honor that is rather a strange remark for a man to make, who professes to come as a friend. By what right, as a friend, or anything else, do you demand an entrance, when the mistress of the mansion does not choose to admit you?" "By the right of will," answered the pirate, fiercely. "Very well," said Peter-who had been talking through the port-hole-" then, by the right of zwill, you must gain an entrance." "I give you one minute more to open the door," said the bold robber, calmly. "Well, what will you do at the expiration of the minute, pro- vided we do not ify you in?" "Burst your d-d old door, and send your miserable souls to h-ll," answered the pirate captain. "By Jupiter," exclaimed Peter, " that's spoken in a friendly spirit, anyhow; and pray, suppose we should open the door, what would then be the consequence?" "O, we will borrcw a few things, and then depart." "Well, I think you had better depart as it is, without waiting," replied Peter. Both parties began to be considerably excited-the one expect- ing to make an attack, the others to receive one. The pirates felt pretty confident of an easy entrance, thinking there were not more than five or six persons in the house, and these miserably armed. Peter, in the meantime, had stationed some of his men so as to be in range of the front door, where, it was evident, the attack was to be made.  After Peter's last reply, the pirate waited a moment, and then said: 1"Once more I demand peaceable entrance, and woe to those within if it is'not granted." "You can enter only over our dead bodies," answered Peter; "I but if an equal number of us within the house cannot keep you out, I aftm much mistaken in the nerve of British sailors." The mention of " equal number," and "British sailors," stag-' gered the captain somewhat, but a moment's consideration convinced him of the improbability of its truth. Waiting a  54         ANNIE WALLACE.               - few moments longer, and seeing no signs of being admitted,  he stepped back among his comrades, and bade six of them,   . armed with heavy broad-axes, to make a rush at the door.   :: Impatiently had the irritated pirates waited during the collo- quy between their leader and those inside, and the moment the : command was given, they sprang towards the door like unleashed  blood-hounds; but only a few strokes of their weapons had  ": sounded upon the massive panels, when a discharge from eight j muskets laid five of the number upon the stoop, three dead, and : two badly wounded; the uninjured one sprang off the piazza, as : his companions, who were armed with pistols, blunderbusses, and :  old muskets, sent back an answering volley. "Down from the ports," shouted Peter, but he was one moment too late, a heavy fall and deep groan told hin that one victim had fallen. Philip'sV hat was also carried from his head, though he himself was unin- : j jured. Taking advantage of the momentary confusion their fire X had occasioned, the pirates had dispatched a new set of men to at-, tack the door. The death of the syce had thrown those inside for a,: moment off their guard; but the ponderous blows at the door soon  restored them'to their senses, and, mounting again to the ports, X they discharged their pieces simultaneously with the bold ma-' rauders outside. Two more of those who assailed the door fell, while the others retreated; those inside all escaped uninjured. After the failure of the second attempt to break the door, they : withdrew some distance from the house, apparently consulting ? together how they should proceed. The young heroes within waited, with some impatience, for the next attack. Nobly they stood; and England might have been proud of this little band of heroes. Presently, they were again called to their posts, by the  re-approach of the daring, ruthless ruffians. They had divided themselves into four parties, with the evident intention of attack- ing the front, and the back, and the windows, at the same : moment. Peter called to the men to fire into them before they had time to separate. Peter's order was instantly obeyed, though but little damage was done-one man, only, being wounded.           !    THE ATTACK BY PIRATES.         55 "Take a steadier aim," cried Peter. Again they fired, with only about the same effect; but the third discharge brought three to the ground. "Good,"  said Peter, ' a few more of those, and we can deal hand to hand with them." Several successive discharges had no effect: suddenly the blows were renewed at the doofs. Manfully each stood at his post, when a cry of agony struggled from their lips, as the front door gave way, and, with a fiendish yell, the pirates sprang in at the doorway. But quickly its noble defenders gathered round them, cutlass in hand. The pirate captain sang out for the right and left divisions to join- him; at the same time, those that had been posted at the windows, collected around Peter and Philip. The midshipmen had the advantage, in the use of their weapons; but they were opposed to too great a number to hold out long; slowly they were falling back, still fighting, and de- manding blood for every inch they surrendered, when the report of two muskets was heard, and the foremost pirate fell dead upon the floor. Those two shots were the salvation of the party; and it so encouraged  the defendants that, by desperate exertion, they gained back all the ground they had lost. Again the two single reports were heard, and one more doomed pirate dropped lifeless. Peter and Philip suspected instantly whence these two shots came, and the encouragement it gave them put new strength into their souls. But skill and energy could not long stand against such superior numbers, and they fell back, exacting a bloody toll. At this moment, the back-door gave way. The defending party withdrew now to the stairs, and there made a stand. Step byr step they fought until they reached the middle of the stairway, nearly exhausted, when they were all partially stunned by a sudden jar, that shook the whole house, and sent seven of the pirates tumbling down the stairs with the breath knocked out of them, and two dangerously wounded. Not knowing the cause, but seeing their advantage, the mid- shipmen, while their assailants were laboring under the surprise   i56        .sA'N N 1E WALLACE. and astonishment caused by the last disastrous catastrophe, plunged among them, and laid two more of their number dead upon the stairs. This last good fortune gave them the superiority in numbers; for, out of thirty-three, twenty-four of the pirates were either dead, or so badly injured, that they were unable to fight, leaving nine only to contend with. The defending party had not escaped: one of the midship- men and two of Madame Corrilla's dependents were dead, while all the rest were more or less injured-Peter, quite badly. Still they were able to use their weapons. The pirates, forming into a compact body, fought with the ferocity of despair. That last blow, which carried away nine of their number, gave the advantage to the midshipmen, and they must either gain or yield, as the steady breeze that was blowing when they landed lad increased to a perfect hurricane, forcing the schooner to beat out to sea without them. Being unable to regain their vessel, or receive any reinforcements, they fought desperately; though instead of advancing, they backed down, lest such another catas- trophe should rob them of all chance of success. The captain had all along exhibited wonderful strength and endurance, and as the now-attacking party advanced, with Peter at their head, he sought Peter out for a single trial of skill. Though badly wounded andc much exhausted, Peter, wild with excitement, was not loth to engage him. The captain made a pass at Peter, which he parried; as he returned the thrust, the captain brought his sword down suddenly, and broke his blade off at the hilt. Peter was now in a ticklish position; but, without losing his presence of mind, he drew his poignard, and, as the captain aimed a dreadful blow at his head which would have terminated his existence, Peter, with wonder- ful dexterity, sprang aside, and closing with the captain, buried his poignard to the handle in the desperate leader's bosom. Giving one deep groan, the pirate fell, carrying Peter with him, who sank from exhaustion and, loss of blood. Peter's success had been shared by his companions, and five minutes after the   THE ATTACK BY PIRATES.         57 fall of their captain the remaining six pirates cried for quarter, which was readily granted. The victory was won, though one more midshipman had paid for his gallantry with his life. Three hearty English cheers rose from the triumphant party, ere they proceeded to perform the necessary duties imposed upon them by circumstances and their success. As soon as the fighting entirely ceased, Philip, who retained sufficient strength to keep his feet, though bleeding pro- fusely, held a consultation with his companions. After arranging for the wounded, they decided to bind the prisoners, which was accordingly done. At this moment, Madame Corrilla and her daughter joined them, and, expressing her thanks, she explained to them how she and her daughter had been enabled to render such timely assistance. She said that, some years ago, a boat- ing-party had been thrown ashore, and that she had bought their boat and a sixpounder with it. The cannon she had brought up stairs and loaded with grape- shot. As soon as she ascertained that th pirates had gained an entrance, she and her daughter wheeled the cannon from its place aln to the platform before-mentioned, and brought it in range for the right moment. Philip replied, that it would have been much better had they known it was in the house before the attack was made. After seeing Peter laid in bed, and the rest of the wounded properly attended to, Philip ordered his companions to carry out  I the dead, while he and Madame Corrilla arranged for them to     1 rest until morning. Philip then retired himself to the room where Peter, who had just returned to consciousness, was lying. An old, gray-haired man was standing at the bedside, habited as a monk. Emily introduced him to Philip as Father Donohue. Philip bowed his head, wondering where the stranger had been during the defense, and whence he came. Peter, calling Philip, inquired if all were safe. "All safe," replied Philip; and, throwing himself on the bed beside Peter, he sank into the arms of Morphlleus.     CHAPTER X. THE RECOGNITION. IT must not be supposed by our readers that, after the attack, Philip and his companions acted as coolly as might be inferred from reading the account of their deportment after their success, in the latter part of the previous chapter. Not one of them was indifferent to the present or the past. Pale faces, hurried steps, and excited gesticulations betrayed their excitement and bewilderment. They were all greatly ex- hausted, and, as soon as the dead were disposed of, and the wounded attended to, feeling no alarm in regard to another attack, they scattered themselves promiscuously about the rooms to sleep. Thus they slept for about two hours, when they were aroused by a terrible knocking at the front door. Springing out of bed, Philip ran down to open it, and the next moment was clasped in the arms of his joyful father. * "My dear, dear son!" cried the old man. "Father!" shouted the youth in surprise. "Hurrah!" he cried, excitedly, "you are too late; but we have beat them! we have beat them!" As briefly as possible, Philip related to his father all that had transpired. The old man listened attentively, interrupting his son frequently by exclamations and bursts of feeling, expressing thankfulness at his safety. In his turn, Don Jose related how his household had been thrown into confusion, by the reception of the news brought by their messenger. "As soon," said he, "as I fully understood your situation, I went myself to the man- of-war, and represented' to the captain the circumstances. He immediately gave directions to one of his lieutenants to arm   'THE IIECOxI'LT!O:.        59 twenty men, and accompany me here. We should have arrived sooner," continued the old man, "but these seamen are such miserable trampers, that we were longer on the road than we ought to have been. But you are safe, my son, and I thank God that I am not deprived the privilege of seeing you again." Madame Corrilla, who was aroused by the arrival of the man- of-war party, came into the room. Senior Marcella congratulated her upon their success in repelling the bold invaders, while she, in turn, tendered her thanks to them for their efforts in her defense. After a little more time spent in desultory conversa- tion, it was decided that the men from the ship should remain all night; so, after giving orders for: the preparation of such refreshment as was necessary for all, arrangements were made for their comfort and repose. Philip invited his father to the room occupied by himself and. Peter, that he might repose him- self after his long, wearisome walk. Peter was lying upon a low bed, with the curtain drawn aside, distinctly disclosing his features to view as the light fell upon him. As they entered the room, Philip's father looked towards the bed, and, seeing Peter's pale face, started back suddenly, and exclaimed: "O, O my God, what a resemblance!"Philip looked at the old man in surprise, while he murmured, "Yes, he has her Grecian profile, her eyebrows, and O, Father in- heaven, who is it? what means this? Philip, my son, I am bewildered; why did not I notice the resemblance before?" At this moment, Peter moved, and, opening his eyes, looked towards Philip, and laughingly requested him to come to bed. "This is my father," said Philip, leading the old man up to the bed. Peter turned his eyes towards him, when Seinor Marcella seized his hand, and said: "What is your name, besides Peter, young man?   Speak quick!" "Wallace," answered, Peter. "And your father?" ( Was Captain Patrick Wallace," replied Peter.     iu0         ANNIE WALLACE. "Great Father in heaven, I thank thee for'this new blessing," said the old man, raising his hands towards heaven. "Peter," continued he, grasping his hand, " your mother was my only daughter, and you are my grand-child." "And my nephew," cried Philip, joyously. Peter hardly seemed to realize what they were saying; but, recovering himself somewhat, said: "If it be true that you are my relatives, then am I rejoiced, more especially on my poor sister Annie's account." "Is your sister Annie still alive?" asked his grandfather, as we shall now call him. "Why, yes," answered Peter, "unless she died recently. What led you to think she was dead?" "We received a letter from Scotland, signed R. Jamieson, in answer to one we had sent to inquire about you. In it was stated that your father and both of his children were dead." "Another of their artful, wicked tricks, to keep us and our property under their control," responded Peter. And, at his grandfather's request, he related the circumstances of his father's second marriage, and his death, and the subsequent ill-treatment of himself and sister by their wicked step-mother. In return, the old sefior informed Peter how his father had married his only daughter. "Your father," said he, "was in the habit of stopping with his vessel at Penang, for the purpose of trading, and replenish- ing his stores. During these visits to the island, he made my house his home. At this time I had living with me my only daughter, Isabella, who, though very youthful, was a widow. Your father, during these visits, became insensibly attached to Isabella. They were affianced, and finally married. Your mother had a large estate left her by her first husband, who specified in his will, that at her death the estate should go to Noria, his daughter." "Why," exclaimed Peter, eagerly interrupting his grand- parent, "Noria must have been my half-sister." ' Certainly she is," replied the senior. "Is she living " inquired he.   THE RECOGNITION.          61 "Yes," replied his grandfather, "and she was in the house the night you spent there." "How singular!" said Peter. " O, that I had known it!" "But let me finish my narrative," said the senor. "The estate left by Noria's father, was transferred to me by your 1) manother, with the consent of Captain Wallace, to hold in trust  for Noria. Your mother lived but a few years after her second marriage: she died at sea, in giving birth to your sister Annie." "O, that I had seen her, or could remember her!" said Peter. "We have a portrait of her at the house-the truest one I have seen." "That," replied Peter, " is a pleasure I little dreamed of." Just at that moment, the light, which had supplied its flame for the last few minutes by consuming the wick, went out. Philip at first proceeded to get another; but, perceiving by the time-piece that their conversation had stretched far into the night, and, indeed, upon looking out of the window, that the day would break ere long, they concluded to seek some repose, which the old man especially needed, after the agitating events that had followed so closely upon each other. Philip threw him- self upon the bed-his father reclined upon the sofa. For two hours they slept soundly, when they were aroused by a great shouting about the house. Not knowing what might be the matter, Philip and his father sprang up, and started for the stairs, where they were met by one of the seamen who had arrived the day before, who was hastening to announce that a gun-boat from the man-of-war had just hove in sight. Philip went to the north window, and, sure enough, there was the boat, about half a mile from the shore. Philip carried the news to Peter, who wanted immediately to get out of bed. But Philip prevented him, thinking he was severely wounded. "No, Philip, I tell you," said Peter, "I am not wounded at all. I was only exhausted, and I have no doubt that I am as strong as yourself." ,Wait until the surgeon of the ship comes, anyhow," anxi- ously pleaded Philip. 6     ANNIE WALLACE. "I will, to oblige you," said Peter; II but I shall feel rather curious, trying to play sick." Philip left him, and went down stairs, where he was met by the lieutenant of the man-of-war, who recognized him, and in- quired how Peter was. "O, very bad," said Philip. "I wish the surgeon was here, for I cannot keep him in bed." "This is the surgeon," replied the lieutenant, pointing to a gentleman at his side, who, turning to Philip, said: "I will go to him at once, if you will lead the way." "I will gladly do so," answered Philip: and turning, led the way up stairs into Peter's room. Going to the bedside, the sur- geon took Peter's hand, and felt his pulse. A smile played around his lips, as he requested Philip to remove the clothes, while he examined whether Peter had any serious wounds. But seeing nothing but bruises, and finding his pulse regular, he could contain himself no longer, and burst into a hearty laugh, as the lieutenant entered the room, and Peter jumped out of bed, feeling rather foolish, in thus appearing in such a ridiculous situation, while Philip stood looking on, surprised and half angry. "Why," said the lieutenant, addressing the surgeon, " it seems to me, you have effected a speedy cure." Ha, ha, ha," roared the surgeon. 'Say, Philip, why the devil don't yotu speak?" cried Peter, greatly bewildered, as he kicked and hammered at the left boot, which he was trying to put upon the right foot.     I "Me speak?" said Philip. , "IWhy, what shall I say?" "Why! didn't I lay a-bed at your request?" continued Peter. "Yes," replied Philip; 1" but you might have told me you were not injured." The conversation of the two young men only increased the laughter of the lieutenant and surgeon, who only ceased when they hurried from the room. As soon as they got out of hearing of the two merry officers, they themselves commenced laughing heartily. They were interrupted by the roll of the drum, which called all hands down to the parlors; but just as they were step-   THE RECOGNITION.          63 ping in at the door, Peter was startled by an exclamation from an Irishman, named Barney, who had always been fond of Peter. "By the' roarin' o' the Daniel, that devoured the lions' din, if r thar isn't the man yeas was tillin' us was kilt. 'The mother o' Jasus bless yer honor, but ye look as tho' ye would be kickin' still, an' they tillin' us that ye was murthered right out-stark dead. The dirty varmints;" and the honest-hearted Paddy grasped his hand. "Do I look like a dead man?" said Peter. "So I was after obsarvin', yer honor." "4 What!" said Peter-" that I looked as thoughl were dead?" "No, yer honor," answered Barney, '"I was only obsarvin' that ye didn't look as though ye was dead." The beating of the drum had been ordered, in accordance to the orders of the lieutenant, having consulted with Madame Corrilla, who had decided to leave the Reef House and return to France.  After attending to the proper burial of all the dead, except the midshipmen, he left six men, under the command of a midshipman, to guard the house, while the remainder of the party, including the Marcellas and Corrillas, went on board the gun- boat. That evening, as the sun sank to rest, the two ill-fated mid- shipmen, that perished in defense of Madame Corrilla's house were buried with military honors. Thus are we taught the uncertainty of human hopes, and the liability of man to be deprived of life in the midst of health. These two young men, full of life and health, started upon an excursion of pleasure, with no anticipation of any encounter or accident-the next day they were borne back, mutilated corpses. That evening, as Peter left the church-yard, in company with Philip and his grandfather, his bosom was filled with strange emotions-his spirit was weighed down with sadness, after wit- nessing the solemn ceremonies attending the burial of the two midshipmen.   He felt thankful for his own escape. Joy was mingled with his changing sensations, while dense and rapidly-     "         ANNIE WALLACE. increasing clouds seemed to envelop his faculties. At last he had met with his nearest relatives; he, who had considered him- self bereft of kindred, suddenly discovered a kind, affectionate grandparent and a sister, of whom he as yet knew nothing. Philip's account of his (Philip's) niece, Noria, had given him a favorable impression; but still he could not decide whether she had the sweet, affectionate disposition of his sweet Annie. Our readers can readily perceive that Peter's sensations were strange and unrealized. His heart beat rapidly as the gari neared the house. Standing upon the piazza, Peter beheld the Corrillas. Madame Corrilla and her daughter had left the ship immediately upon its arrival, and proceeded to Senor Marcella's house. A third person also stood upon the piazza--a dark-eyed young girl, who was standing with one hand resting upon the balustrade, and the other thrown around Emily Corrilla's waist. "1 Who is that dark-eyed girl?" a voice seemed to whisper in Peter's ear. "My sister," replied Peter's heart; and a wild gush of joy swept over his soul, as he realized the fact. The gari stopped at the door, and Philip called "Noria." Yes-it was she. "It is my sister," again whispered Peter's heart. Peter's grandfather leisurely followed Philip out of the car- riaoe, when Peter rose, pale and trembling. As he advanced up the steps his head reeled, and his heart bounded with a quicker motion. But Peter was not the only excited one-the impetuous, heedless Philip had informed Noria that his friend Peter was her brother. "Nria, this is your brother: Peter, your sister," said Philip; { and he withdrew, as the stranger brother and sister rushed into each other's arms. Peter clasped his new sister to his bosom, and, as he held her there, memory's magic mirror presented a dark-eyed girl, that used to lead him by the hand to church. "Noria," he murmured, "t yes it is the name that has haunted me in dreams." How long the brother and sister remained in each other's arms they knew not; but, when they cast their eyes about them, they were surprised to find'themselves alone. Leading his sister to a   THE RECOGNITION.          65 settee, Peter told, explained, and inquired all in one breath. Nothing could have made them more familiar or confidential than that blessed bond of sister and brother. "Noria," inquired Peter, "have you any remembrance of me? '"Yes," answered his sister, "I remember you as a little boy, but I never should have recognized you now, as my little brother Peter. But, our dear sister Annie," she continued, " oh how I wish she was here to be my companion-my sister., It is too hard for the poor little thing to be left with those self-interested relatives." "But she shall not be long," said Peter; "I will get leave of absence from Bny vessel, and take passage in the first Chinaman on her return voyage." ",Oh, Peter, I am so glad that you are such a brother; if you have your father's spirit, she will come." For some time longer, the brother and sister remained in con- versation, when they were interrupted by Philip, who came to announce that supper was waiting, and informed them that two hours had elapsed since they had first been reunited. Surprised at the rapid flight of time, they arose and went into the tea- room, where they were met by the greetings and congratulations of the whole household. Sefior Jose Marcella's sister looked long and earnestly at Peter, and then burst into tears. Soon they were all seated around the table, and quiet, social happiness beamed in every countenance. The malicious angel of misfortune and sorrow, whose mission is to dampen mortal bliss, upon this occasion was banished, by the smiling, joyous angel of happiness. Happily the hours winged away until they separated for the night-; though, during the evening, Peter had managed to gain his grandfather's attention for an hour, when he proposed bringing Annie to Penang. The plan met with his grandfather's entire approba- tion. The next morning Peter hurried on board the ship, and sought an interview with the captain. He stated the circumstances and     "         ANNIE WALLACE. his wish. The captain granted his request, adding, with a smile, that he could play sick. Peter thanked him for his kindness, and, calculating the time it would require to go to England and secure a passage for his sister's return, he asked the captain where he should meet the ship. The captain replied that he had better remain in. England, as his (the captain's) cruising time had nearly expired. Thanking him again, Peter left the ship and returned ashore. A few days later, he engaged passage on board a Chinaman for Philip, who had decided to go, and the Corrillas and himself. A week later, after an affectionate parting, they sailed. We shall leave them to pursue their homeward voyage, and return to the lonely Annie. CHAPTER     XI, THE STEP-MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. AGAIN we would invite the reader to accompany us to Edin- burgh, the capital city of Scotland. At one of the parlor- windows of that same marble house that we described in one of our former chapters, stood Annie Wallace, the day succeeding her departure from G--.  She appeared pale, irritated, 'and weary; her step-mother she had not as yet seen-Mrs. Wallace having gone to an evening party the previous afternoon, and remained so late, that she was unable to rise at a proper hour. Annie waited a long time, thinking that, under the circumstances, her mother might make a little extra exertion. It was nearly three o'clock before Mrs. Wallace left her room. With stately steps, she proceeded to the parlor, expecting to find Annie tremblingly awaiting her presence. As she entered the parlor door, she curled her lip haughtily, and assumed a lofty dignity of manner.   THE STEP-MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.        67 But, unfortunately for the disappointed woman, Annie was not there; the only occupant of the room was her brother Robert, who was sitting upon one of the lounges, engaged in turning the pages of an architectural plan-book. "Good-afternoon, sister," said the brother. "Good-afternoon," curtly replied Mrs. Wallace. "Have you seen Annie within the last few moments?" she inquired. "I have," replied Robert.  J "And where is she?" asked his sister. "She has gone to call upon the Montgomerys." "What! gone to call upon the Montgomerys! the unfeeling girl-she has not seen me yet." '"I told her," replied the brother, "that she had better wait and see you first, and she replied that she had waited long enough for you to come down, and, as you did not choose to come, she would go. I tell you what, Jane," continued her brother, "you will have to take pretty decided steps to check that girl; she begins to exhibit a disposition which I presume she inherited from her mother."        - "She waited long enough for me to come and see her, did she! very well, I'll wait now;" and, taking a book, the lady I threw herself upon a lounge and commenced reading. Pres- ently Annie came in; her step-mother arose, and, bowing haugh- tily, said: "Good-afternoon, Annie." "Good-afternoon, ma'am," replied Annie, quite as haughti- ly. "You showed but little courtesy, Annie, in going to call upon your acquaintances before seeing me." "I am not aware of showing any greater lack of courtesy by going out, than you did, by preferring to keep your room rather come down to see me." "Such impertinence ill becomes you, my dear," said Mrs. i Wallace, angrily. "Thank you," calmly replied Annie. "I wish you to understand," said Mrs. Wallace, "that you      68         ANNIE WALLACE. are not to expect to brave me as you did Mrs. Barton. You are aware that I am not your governess." "I never considered that you were," answered Annie. "You consider!" said her mother, irritated by Annie's cool, self-possessed manner; " you have no business to consider." "Madam?" replied the daughter. "Annie, go immediately to your room, and do not leave it again this evening." "Yes, madam," said Annie, without making any movement towards going.         / "Will you go immediately?" inquired her mother, pale with  i anger. "No, I will not go," answered Annie; " and, Mrs. Wallace, I wish you to understand, from the first, that I do not consider myself under your control at all, as, by my father's will, it was decided that I should be left to the charge of my grandfather." "Your grandfather, to be sure! a poor, miserable, gambling overseer of a lot of negroes. You'll go to him, will you: you will get there first; and, if you succeed in that, you will manage to take care of yourself from your own resources." "Fortunately, madam, I am not dependent on you for the I means to get there or remain there." Mrs. Wallace could hardly contain herself: looking towards Annie, she said: "I would like to know, miss, where you got your information concerning your father's directions in regard to yourself?" "From Mr. Montgomery," replied Annie. "How did Mr. Montgomery come to say anything to yo[ about it?" inquired her mother. '"I sought the information: I wished to know'whether I was bound to you and your hatred." "I suppose you told Mr. Montgomery what an ugly mother you had." "I did," replied Annie, "only I used the word unfeeling, instead of ugly." "You did, did you, miss apertinence; very well, your father   I      THE STEP-MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.         69 left a codicil to his will, added just before he died, leaving you and your property at my disposal."  "I shall believe that," replied Annie, "when I see the addi- tion, signed by him." "What! you pretend to disbelieve me!" "No, ma'am," replied Annie. "What, then, do you mean?" "What I said." Just at that moment, they were interrupted by Robert, who came into the room accompanied by a friend. Mrs. Wallace, in an instant, assumed a pleasant, smiling appearance, as her brother introduced Sir William Crowsley. Mrs. Wallace returned his salute, and in turn introduced her daughter. - Annie bowed: stiffly, and then retired to her room to weep and meditate. Annie retired early to her couch; her sleep was disturbed by hideous dreams. She seemed pursued by a demon, whose coun- tenance very much resembled that of her step-mother. Annie was flying before her; when they neared a precipice, the fiend reached after her, when, with one bound, she went over. The dizzy- sensation awoke her, and, starting up in affright, she found herself in her own chamber, surrounded by the darkness of mid- night. She soon became composed, and again slept. This time, her dreams were more pleasing: she seemed to be in some dis- tant place, surrounded by-kind and affectionate friends, when, just as she was experiencing a'fullness of joy in the realization of her hopes, she awoke to dull reality, and a rainy November morning. Annie's feelings were quite as gloomy as the weather: she arose and languidly commenced to dress, and, going down stairs, partook of a solitary breakfast. After finishing her meal, she repaired to the parlor, and amused herself with running her fingers over the keys of the instrument, finally gliding into a - low melody, in unison with her gloomy feelings. The horizon of her future displayed no glowing sun rising slowly and surely, dispelling the clouds, and drying Jup the damp dews of night. Her spirit was depressed-her heart was almost ready to yield     70   /      ANNIE WALLACE. to the promptings of desair. Slowly the hours passed, and melancholy thoughts pressed upon her, until her heart was almost i crushed with sadness. She walked to, the window: the rain was pouring in torrents; pedestrians dodger along, leaping and splashing through the mud and water which was accumulating on the street. , At this moment, a coach drove rapidly by; Annie was care- lessly looking at the drenched horses and driver, when her atten- X tion was attracted by the countenance of one of its inmates. J She strained her eyes as the carriage hurriedly passed, and recognized Henry Monteith. She was not mistaken. "It was surely he," murmured Annie. "What could have brought him to Edinburgh?-I wonder if he will call and see me-I hope so."  And, as she turned from the window, her heart was lighter; her bosom was relieved of much of the weight i that oppressed her, and she experienced a reaction. Again the unrealized phantom, hope, took possession of her heart, and i: Annie was contented, though not happy. She returned to the piano, and commenced playing in more lively strains, when her mother entered with her brother Robert. "Good-morning, Annie," said her uncle.          i Annie returned the salutation with studied politeness. "Annie," commenced her uncle, "I am grieved at the account your kind mother gives me of your willfulness; your conduct so affects her, that she is robbed of comfort during the day, and of sleep at night; and it is necessary for her health, that you  should be sent away. We have consulted together in regard to you, and have decided to send'you to a convent in the south of France." "I will not go," said Aninie, quietly. "But, my dear," said her step-uncle, " you will have to go." Annie coolly repeated her determination not to go.  - "Very well," calmly replied her uncle, " it is unnecessary to say anything more about it-you must go, and that, too, as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements for you to travel in safety'    THE STEP-MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.        71         j Annie said no more, but continued her amusement. In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and, as the young girl sat reading, a servant came to inform her that a gentleman inquired for her. Annie ordered him to be shown up stairs, and the servant announced, "Mr. Monteith." With a glad countenance, Annie stepped forward and bade him welcome. Mr. Monteith advanced with an easy grace, and expressed his happiness at seeing her again, adding, in excuse for his early call, that, as he was walking past, he had observed the name upon the door-plate, and, upon inquiry, found it was, her moth- er's residence. "Make no excuses," said Annie, "I am rejoiced to see you; I am very lonely and wretched in this house. But take a seat and tell me how you left the town of G---  and its inhabit- ants." "Just as you did," replied Henry. '"I started for Edinburgh the same day you left Dr. Barton's. I should have kept my promise to ride with you, had I not been forced by circumstances to start earlier than you purposed going."  "I expected you," replied Annie; "but, as you did not appear, I imagined that, perhaps, you might possibly be trying, some more shooting experiments." 4' No," answered he, "I came on here post-haste; I was directed to do so, in a letter I found waiting me from my father on the night I parted from you." Mr. Monteith remained but a few minutes longer, *and then took leave, promising to call on the succeeding day. After his departure, Annie threw herself upon a lounge, and gave up to day-dreams, in which the image of Mr. Monteith was very prominent.  Still. Annie flattered herself she was not in love; perhaps she was not, strictly speaking-certainly she was not one to be won unsought; but, situated as she had been since her acquaintance with Mr. Monteith, his attentions and kindness had been very soothing to her in her loneliness and  72         ANNIE WALLACE. isolation from all friendly sympathy, and esteem and friendship had certainly grown up in her bosom; and, where such feelings exist in the heart of a young girl towards one of the opposite sex, i is but an easyfgradation to a warmer sentiment. Thus Annie, although not positively in love with Henry Monteith, found herself, sometimes, speculating upon the nature of his feel- ings towards her, and wondering if his visits and attentions were dictated by a warmer sentiment than mere friendship. Henry Monteith's cogitations upon the subject were very near : akin to those of Annie, sometimes; the young lady had certainly created a more than ordinary interest in his bosom: he did not, perhaps could not, exactly define what that interest was. It is  certain he thought her a very lovely girl; although sometimes a 'l strange" one; as he had expressed himself on the evening of  their walk in the town of G--- ; but her winning, playful man-  ners, destitute of all art and affectation ; her frankness, united to strong good-sense and judgment beyond her years; while the evident pleasure she seemed to take in'his society-all combined  to strengthen and increase the interest that he felt, and Annie  had begun to occupy .a very large share of his thoughts. That same evening, while Anpie was sitting alone in her room, a servant came to summon her to the parlor, where Mrs. Wallace was awaiting her. Annie went immediately down, and   found her mother sitting byone of the windows. As Annie entered the room, she arose, and, taking her kindly by the hand, introduced her to a gentleman whom Annie had not before observed. "This is my daughter, Walter," said Mrs. Wallace, and, turn- ing to her daughter, said: "My brother Walter."     [i Won by her kind manner, and always hopeful and ready to forgive, Annie bowed gracefully and pleasantly to her mother's brother. "We have had rather strange weather," remarked Walter Jamieson. i' Yes," answered Annie; "the morning has been gloomy and unpleasant." " ,          I:   THE MSUNDERSTANDING.          73 ' Yes," he replied; "I have been riding for some hours, and feel glad to find myself at home." Annie wondered if this was his home. During the day and evening, Walter Jamieson strove to make himself agreeable. Annie was pleased with him, and was glad of anything to relieve the gloom and monotony of her life. Walter Jamieson was about thirty-two years of age. He was a young man of bad principles and dissipated' habits. What money had been left him by his father, he had squandered with evil com- panions, or lost at the gaming-table. He had come to Edin- burgh at this time at the request of his sister, for what purpose his actions and their conversations will readily disclose. Mrs. Wallace was about to sell herself to sin, and Annie to misery, by uniting her to this talented, but unprincipled brother. CHAPTEtR XII. THE MSUNDERSTANDING. AT breakfast, next morning, Mrs. Wallace did the honors of the table herself, in compliment to her brother. To Annie she was kind and affectionate in her manner, and as they left the breakfast-room, she said; "We have misunderstood each other, my dear." The kind words of her step-mother won Annie s forgiveness immediately, and her affections, by continued kindness, coulld have been easily won; the past would have been forgotten, and she could have respected, and even loved, her once-cruel step- i mother. The company adjourned to the parlor, when Walter  Jamieson invited Annie to play something lively upon the piano. I Annie sat down, and played several pieces which were much 7   74         ANNIE WALLACE. admired by "Uncle Walter," as he styled himself. 1"But not uncle enough to prevent my falling in love," he added, archly. "Too much for me, though," replied Annie. After spending a portion of the morning in music and con- versation, Jamieson invited Annie to accompany him to an exhi- bition of paintings. Annie would have declined going, but he pleaded earnestly, while her step-mother joined him in urging her, until at last, Though unwillingly, she was prevailed upon to go. "Walter wishes to walk," said Mrs. Wallace, as Annie came down into the parlor, ready equipped for their promenade. But the remark of Mrs. Wallace was a deception, as her brother had just been urging her to allow him the use of the carriage. Crowds thronged the doors of the exhibition rooms, seeking admission. Jamieson elbowed his way through as though he was used to such inconveniences. He hurried Annie along as rapidly as possible, until they had entered the building, when they walked slowly through the rooms. Annie found great pleasure in ex- amining the works of art which were on exhibition. They had sauntered on thus for about half an hotu, and were about ascend- ing the stairs to another gallery, when a gentleman seized Jamie- son by the arm, exclaiming, "Why, Walter, old chum, I am glad to see you." Jamieson returned the familiar salutation of the stranger coldly, and attempted to proceed without further discourse; but the young man approached and said: "I bring news from--"  Before he could finish the sentence, Walter cut him short, saying hurriedly, "Another time, Maitland, another time," and rapidly passed on. Annie would not have noticed the interruption, or would have forgotten it immediately, but for Jamieson's strange manner, and evident perturbation. His face was deadly pale, and as they walked on, he cast quick, nervous glances, behind, as if he dreaded the approach of some one. Well might Walter Jamieson feel disturbed. He was about to play a deep game, and sink him- self still lower in the scale of moral degradation; but an expo- sure at this time would upset all his plans, and cheat him of the     THE MSUNDERSTANDING.         75 glittering prize which so strongly tempted him. But we will not anticipate., The pleasure which Annie had taken hitherto, in examining the paintings, had fled. She saw that something was wrong, and distrusted her companion, so she proposed returning home. Jamieson did not immediately attend to her request; but, after a short time, seemed suddenly relieved of his apprehensions, and signified his willingness to return with her. As they passed out of the rooms, Annie observed Henry Monteith enter with a gentleman. He saw Annie at the same moment; glancing at her companion, he bowed, and passed on. In the evening, Henry called and inquired for Miss Wallace, but was informed that she had retired with a headache. He left the house, vexed and dis- appointed. The encounter of the morning had aroused a slight tinge of jealousy; he half suspected that the headache was a 'use, and that Annie's companion of the morning was a favored rival. Alas, for poor Annie! where were all the pleasing im- pressions of her frankness and good sense that Henry had once indulged? He returned to his hotel, exchanged" his coat and boots for dressing-gown and slippers, and resolved to make him- self comfortable with a book. What was Annie Wallace to him? why should he be troubled if she preferred others to him. "I am as independent as yourself, Miss Wallace," muttered he; "' I should not have called at all, if I had known my presence was' disagreeable; however, she need feel no alarm for the future; Henry Monteith is not susceptible enough to any lady's fascina- tions, to prevent him exercising his judgment. I will not easily surrender my independence to love; but a truce to these l  thoughts. Heigho-what if I should be mistaken after all, and Annie should be really ill? Still, I think she rather avoided speaking in the morning. I would not wish to lose my good opinion of Miss Wallace, certainly, although I am actuated by no warmer feeling than friendship." Thus Henry mused and argued to himself; at one moment: feeling sure that Annie had ill-used him, and that he detested her; the next, having such lively apprehensions regarding her   76         ANNIE WALLACE.              X illness, that he was ready to fly to her and offer sympathy, friendship, everything, but love-oh, no, he was not the victim of the tender passion. Inexperienced young man, he knew not the voice of his own heart; he heard its pleadings, but knew not their source. Henry's meditations were interrupted by a rap at his door. "Come in," said Henry. The door opened, and Viscount Moray entered the room. Henry invited his titled guest to a seat and cigar, and then re- sumed his position on a lounge. "You seem to be taking things very calmly," remarked the viscount. "Well, my dear sir," replied Henry, "I have nothing in par- ticular to prevent me; and, even if I had, it would be all the same. I am satisfied with the present, and will try to make the best of the future-when it comes." "Would you like to know what your future will be?" said the viscount. "I would not refuse information concerning the future, did I deem it possible that such information could be given, which I do not; neither would I seek it. Why did you ask the question?" "Oh, only that I thought if you had any curiosity on the subject it might be easily gratified; there is a gipsy in the house at present, amusing and frightening the servants." "Why don't you let her tell yours?" said Henry. "She has told my fortunes, or misfortunes rather," replied the viscount. "She has piled a mighty host of troubles on top of the discouragements I have already had to contend with, and did I believe one-quarter of her miserable tales, I would soon be Viscount Moray that was and is not." "Well," replied Henry, "since you have listened to her, so will I;" and he arose and rang the bell. When the servant ap- peared, he ordered the fortune-teller to be sent to his room. The young gentleman waited a few moments, when some one knocked at the door. "Come in," called Henry.   THE MSUNDERSTANDING.          " The knock was repeated-when he arose and opened the door. The old crone nodded stiffly, and hobbled into the room. "Well, old beldame, cast your prophetic eyes on me," said Monteith, " and tell me, if you can, what the future has in store. As you penetrate the mists of futurity, overlook the good, and tell me only of the evil, that will beset my path." Henry shrewdly suspected that this gipsy-although bearing in her countenance a strong resemblance to this peculiar race- was just no gipsy at all, but one of those individuals who pos- sess themselves, by some mysterious necromancy, of the family history of all who fall in their way, and make use of it to pretend to supernatural powers.. After Henry had made his request, the old woman looked long and steadfastly at him, and, without changing her position, closed her eyes. "Come, come; don't go to sleep," said Henry. "I am not sleeping, young man; but I'll not blame ye; ye may well be impatient, ye was born at sunrise." "That's true enough," replied Henry. The old crone closed her eyes again, and appeared to be sleep- ing. Henry aroused her a second time, when she said: "Young man, I was but obeying your orders-to overlook the good, and seek your evil fortune to disclose; but no cloud hangs over your future to dim my vision; a bright sun gilds your pathway-your good star is predominant; you will love and be loved by one with dark eyes and hair-a native of a distant isle; your future bride whom you have never seen." "C There, you are wrong," hastily replied Henry. The witch grinned as she answered: "s Why seek me if you do not believe me-you betray yourself." Henry bit his lip with vexation. He saw that his suspicions were true with regard to the character of the pretended seeress, and that he had partially committed himself. "Go on," said hle. "Your marriage will take place upon a distant island, where the snows of winter never come." She continued for some time   ANNIE WALLACE. longer in the same strain, until Monteith dismissed her with a crown, quite satisfied with the knowledge afforded by her gipsy lore. The viscount, also, took his departure, and Henry retired, to dream of wedding-parties on distant islands. CHAPTER    XIII. THE PROPO AL IREFUSAL AND DETERMNATION. TiE attentions of Walter Jamieson soon became annoying to Annie--each day betrayed some trait that was disagreeable in his character. She decidedthat he was selfish and unprincipled; still his familiarity increased as time passed on. If she went to  walk, he was sure to meet her, and accompany her home; if she stayed at home, he was disinclined to go out; and thus, unless she kept her room, he was sure to be at her side. Upon one of these occasions, when Annie had been to visit a friend, he took the opportunity to make a confession of his feelings. Annie had left her friend's house late in the afternoon, and proceeded about two squares, when she was accosted by Walter Jamieson. "Good-evening, Annie," said he. Annie returned his salutation, and he offered his arm, which she accepted, with ill-concealed reluctance. "You have been spending the day at the Montgomerys?", "Yes," replied Miss Wallace. A pause succeeded this short colloquy; and, as they walked on, Jamieson appeared quite restless--twirling his cane-cutting figures in the air with it; one moment walking rapidly, the next sauntering s  lowly; which annoyed Annie, as they had some dis- tance to go. he was not talkative, as usual; and Annie had just made up her mind to endure his company more resn is ' "co mpany more resizerdlvt'   THE PROPOSAL, REFUSAL, AND DETERMNATION. 79 on account of his silence, when he turned suddenly towards her and said- "It is quite fortunate, Annie, that I am not your uncle in reality." "Very fortunate," replied Annie, not knowing why he thought so, but well assured of her own reasons. "You know," said Jamieson, that we are no more to each other than strangers." Yes, I know," said she. "We are bound by no ties of consanguinity." "No, sir," replied Annie-beginning to understand his motive for wishing that fact so fully understood. "Yet, Annie," said Walter, in a subdued voice, "we may be united by dearer, closer ties." "May we?" replied Annie, sarcastically. "Yes, dearest," continued Walter fondly, "we may  be one." "How can we be one?" said Annie, pretending ignorance. "Do not trifle, Annie," said Walter, deprecatingly. "Why, you are the greatest trifler I think," replied Annie. "I a trifler? You surprise me. I may trifle sometimes, but this, Annie, is the most serious moment of my life." "Perhaps so, Uncle Walter, but you seem to me to be talking nonsense," "What! is the earnest expression of my heart's feelings non- sense?" "Your heart's feelings9" said Annie, innocently, the mischievous girl pretending to misunderstand Walter, who did not suppose she would venture thus to trifle with him: his superlative vanity would not permit him to think that. "Yes, dear," continued Walter, "my heart is laid open to you; its best, purest affection is tendered to you; do you accept the offering?" "Walter Jamieson, I cannot pretend longer to misunderstand you; but I cannot think that you are in full possession of your senses, or you would not talk thus to me. Truly I hope, for I     80         ANNIE WALLACE. your own sake, that this aberration of mind will be transient, or that in future you will choose some other listener." Walter was confounded.  His vanity and presumption had led him to suppose that Annie would at least be flattered by his preference. His position was an awkward one: he had made a clear, explicit avowal of affection, when she to whom he made his confession coolly inquired if he were not laboring under an "aberration of mind." Still he could not believe these were Annie's real sentiments towards him. He did not know her      V settled contempt, and he attributed her manner to shyness and maiden reserve. "Annie," said he, " your simplicity and artlessness but increase my admiration for you, and adds to the fervor of my devotion; but, my dear girl, do understand me.  I love you; nay, idolize you, and my happiness, my very life, depends upon your appreciating the depths of passion which sweep over my Soul." ," I understand you, sir," said Annie, coldly; " this is your plan, I suppose, for making us one?" " "Yes," said Walter; " one in heart, one in soul. It is blessed, truly blessed thus to be united." "Walter Jamieson," said Annie, assuming a serious look, "I will be plain with you. Such a union, no doubt, is blessed- replete with true happiness; but to realize its blessedness, to experience its happiness, it is necessary the beings thus united should have a deep, well-tried affection, founded not upon mere admiration for beauty or talent, but upon a more solid basis- esteem for the noble qualities of the heart and mind, tempered by Christian graces. Such unions should not be the result of mere fancy, nor be entered into upon short acquaintance. These being my sentiments, there is an impassable barrier be- tween us. Further, I have not the faintest throb of that strange absorbing spell, that gathers the affections of the heart, and unites them in that soul-thrilling sensation called love." "Oh, dearest Annie! will you drive me to madness? May I not hope-or must I despair?"    THE PROPOSAL, REFUSAL, AND DETERMNATION. 81 c; You can do which of the three you choose," answered Annie; "I have no interest in saving you from either."         - "Annie, spare me, oh, spare me!" "I am sure I do not intend to hurt you," replied Annie. "Do not insult me," said Walter Jamieson, suddenly assuming a threatening manner. "I shall not if you desist." "I will desist," said Walter; yet I feel that it was unnecessary that you should treat me thus. Though you may not choose to accept my love, I have done you honor by offering it. I have neither wronged you nor insulted you; I have but rendered homage to your beauty of mind and person. I have shown the greatest appreciation of both, that it is possible for man to do; and, though you have a perfect right to reject my offers, you exceed the privileges of your sex when you treat me thus. Pity, yes, even pity alone, should have prompted-you to exhibit a generous sympathy, and have induced you to soothe, rather than irritate. If I have been presumptuous-if I have been premature   i in improving this opportunity to make known my regard for you-I have been sufficiently punished in having to endure the mortification and disappointment attending a rejection." Annie saw her error, and she immediately admitted it, and as    readily apologized for it. She could not forbear treating his last appeal with respect, although it emanated from so unworthy a source. As we have said in a foregoing chapter, Walter Jamie- son was a talented young man. He understood human nature; he knew the right, but chose the wrong. In conversation he was teloquent, and at times he would fascinate his listeners. Walter had some good traits, but they had never been properly culti- vated. When he sought Annie's hand, it was from interested motives. Annie was rich-her vast wealth would be exhaustless   i in its ability to minister to his gratification. It was her money he sought, although he was well satisfied with her beauty and   l attainments. He knew his power. He had exerted himself before   j her, and he imagined that he had made an impression on her     young heart; but Annie was not as simple as he thought ,i     83         ANNIE WALLACE. --she could admire his talents, and abhor his principles and character. Several times she had expected a confession of his pretended attachment; but she knew the glittering prize that tempted him to seek her-she knew his motives, and spurned him. She had been harsh in her replies when he made the declaration, but she knew that anything she could say would make but little impres- sion upon his hardened nature. She had purposely tried to mortify him, for she felt indignant at his presuming manner while making his professions; but when hemade such an appeal to her sympathies as a woman, she could not help feeling con- demned, and she asked his pardon. By this time they had arrived at home. Annie thanked Walter for his attendance, though she would gladly have dispensed with it: she had preferred walking home alone. Walter's services had always been disagreeable; and she hoped now that she would be troubled with them no more. Vain was such a hope. Walter Jamieson was not a man to be discouraged by a simple refusal. Annie's fortune, when acquired (or rather the income that was to be allowed him by his sister, to whom he was to relinquish tile estates for her assistance in procuring them, she promising to allow him an extravagant income), was too great an object to be easily given up; and he determined, within his own mind, she should be his wife, and the estates also should be his. Merrily would he laugh to himself when he imagined his sister's chagrin, when she discovered that she had been outwitted. . As soon as Annie got into the house, she went immediately to her room, while Walter sought his sister, whom he found in the parlor. He walked into the room, threw himself upon a lounge, and appeared to be thinking. His sister looked at him inquig- ingly, but he said nothing. For some time they sat in silence  when his sister inquired if he felt sick. "Yes," he replied, "I do feel sick." "'Are you Seriously ill?" asked his sister. c Yes," answered the brother, "I am seriously ill. My health, yea, my life, depends upon the treatment of one person."   THE PROPOSAL, REFUSAL, AND DETERMNATION. 83 "What!" said his sister, anxiously, have you proposed?" "I have," he replied.                      , "c And she refused you?" "She not only refused, but insulted pie." 't The insolent girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Wallace. "Stop, sister," said Walter; "use no such language when speaking of her who is to be my future wife." "Why, I thought she had just refused you," said Mrs. Wallace. ' So she has," replied Walter; "but, my dear sister, do you suppose that a simple refusal will discourage me from making a second attempt? No, Jane, I will not be discouraged; I will follow each step she takes; I will prove my devotion; I Will accept no refusal. With rivals I will quarrel, and should she continue to refuse me, I will force her, yes, force her, to listen to me." "That is right, my dear brother, 'Faint heart never won fair Nldy.' Annie is no common prize, though she has a bitter tongue. Go on; keep up your courage, and if, with my assist- ance you do not get her, I shall be much disappointed." Soon after, the brother and sister separated. A day or two after the above conversation, Annie and Mrs. Wallace were riding together, when Mrs. Wallace remarked to Annie that it was time for her to begin to think of getting settled in life. "Let me see," she continued, "you are now past seventeen, are you not?" 4' Yes, madam," replied Annie. "Well, my dear, how would you like to marry a nice, hand- some fellow." "I am in no hurry to be married," answered. Annie, who saw in a moment to what allusions her mother was approach- ing. "There is no necessity for you to be in a hurry; at the same time you might choose some one with whom you think you could live happy."  / ( How do you know but that I have made such a choice,"     84         ANNIE WALLACE. said Annie, knowing that such a remark would cause her step- mother some alarm. Young and inexperienced as Annio was, she had discovered the perfect heartlessness of her step-mother, and she saw through their plan of inducing her to marry Walter, which she was determined not to do. As Annie anticipated, her remark did excite the suspicions of her mother, who, slightly turning pale, quickly inquired:' "Have you made any such choice, Annie?" "I have," replied Annie. "And who, pray, is the favored gentleman?" "Oh, he is a young officer," replied Annie, "; a person of good family, and possessed of great wealth. I will not marry a man that is not willing to marry me for myself, and not my money; and before I ever allow the ceremony to be performed, I will require my husband to take my money and endow some semi- nary of learning." This last remark was intended as a damper to the hopes of Walter Jamieson. Mrs. Wallace readily understood the hint; but, controlling her feelings, she-said: ' How long do you expect to wait before having the ceremony performed?" "O, it will be some time yet." "Where did you first meet your future husband? Is he that young gentleman Mrs. Barton wrote about, who was so attentive to you while you was at G ----?" (' Perhaps,"' answered Annie, evasively.. When they arrived home, Mrs. Wallace sent for her brother Walter. The servant returned, and stated that he had gone to walk with Mr. Robert Jamieson. "When he returns,"' said Mrs. Wallace, "inform him that I wish to see him immediately." For a long time Mrs. Wallace sat in her room, thinking about Annie and her engagement; and in her own mind she resolved, that, if she could accomplish her end by no other means, shle would use force. For two hours she remained alone, when some one knocked at the door.   THE PROPOSAL, REFUSAL, AND DETERMNATION. 85 "Come in," called Mrs. Wallace. The door opened, and her brother entered the room. "' Take a seat, Walter, I have some news for you." "And pray what is it?" "Miss Annie is engaged." "What!" said Walter. "Annie Wallace is engaged," repeated the sister. "Is she, indeed! And who is the happy mortal?" "Henry Monteith," replied the sister. "Henry Monteith! Where did he meet with Annie? He is an important rival: why, he is as rich, if not richer, than Annie herself." "Well, I do not believe that they really are engaged. I think Annie anticipated that I was going to speak a good word for you, this afternoon, and she insinuated they were engaged, when they really are not. Still, I think she likes him." "Then they might just as well be engaged," said the brother. "That depends entirely upon your management. Now, you are acquainted with Henry Monteith, and he is at present in Edinburgh. It-will be easy for you to renew the acquaintance, and then, in regard to Annie and yourself, you can insinuate just what you please. It takes but little to excite a lover's jealousy. Henry Monteith has been here once, and it is likely he will come again. I will manage to corroborate your state- ments to him, provided Annie is not at home when he calls." "That will do," said the brother; and, thanking his sister for her solicitude, he left her, when she resumed her thoughts and completed her plans. 8     CHAPTER XIV. PLOTTING. WHEN Jamieson left his sister, he did so with the intention of seeking Henry Monteith. When he offered to quarrel with his rivals, he did not anticipate having to compete with one who, in wealth and position in society, was far his superior. Henry Monteith he knew to be a young man of great wealth and influ- ence, by his relationship, on his mother's side, to some of the first families in the kingdom. The moment Walter Jamieson ascertained who was the claimant for Annie's hand, he saw that by strategy alone he would dare get rid of him. He was some- what acquainted with Henry Monteith, and, through his great knowledge of human nature, he ascertained that he was naturally of a jealous disposition. He knew him to be impulsive and pas- sionate, and he imagined it would be an easy matter to destroy any attachment he might cherish for Annie. That evening he attended a club, having previously learned that Henry Monteith would be there. Upon arriving at the rooms, he was not disappointed; for, there sat Henry sur- rounded by a number of friends. Jamieson took a seat one side, but kept near enough to hear the conversation carried on between Monteith and his companions. "How is it, Monteith," said the handsome Viscount Moray, "that you are not with your ship?" "Why, have you never heard of the accident I met with?" answered Henry. "No," said the viscount; "' what befell you? did you fall from your horse?"   PLOTTING.           87 "No, no," replied Henry; "I and Percy Malcolm were experi- mentingD with some pistols, when one of them exploded in my hand and made quite a sad affair of it. I was confined to my room for two months. In the mean time, the ship sailed, and, fortunately, I have received orders to wait until she returns, which will give me quite a run on shore." "And time to look after that (dark-eyed girl from some dis- tant isle,'" said Viscount Moray, alluding to the prediction of the fortune-teller. At the mention of "dar1i-eyed girl," Walter Jamieson bent eagerly forward to hear Monteith's reply. But Henry appeared not to notice the viscount, and answered the question of some one else concerning his accident. Jamieson was under the neces- sity of waiting a long time, before he got an opportunity to speak to Henry Monteith. At last, such a chance offered. Monteith started to leave the club-rooms, when he observed Jamieson. ' Ah, Jamieson, how are you?" said he. "I did not observe you were here. How long have you been in Edinburgh?" "About two months," replied Jamieson. "I am staying with my sister, Mrs. Wallace." '"Mrs. Captain Wallace?" inquired Monteith. "Yes," replied Jamieson. As soon as Henry Monteith learned that Jamieson was staying at the same house with Annie, he determined to cultivate an acquaintance, which he otherwise would not have been so anxious to form. Though he knew nothing in particular against Jamie- son--having known him at school as the son of a wealthy mer- chant-still, he had never taken a particular fancy to him; and, though he had always treated Jamieson civilly, he never had cultivated an intimacy. But, when he discovered that he might be useful in giving some information he wished, he invited him to accompany him to his (Monteith's) rooms. Jamieson gladly accepted Monteith's invitation, and both were pleased; as the one hoped to gain an object by the invitation, and the other to gain a point by its acceptance; and, arm-in-arm, they proceeded to the hotel, engaged in a general conversation.     88         ANNIE WALLACE. * When they had become seated, and had lighted their regalias, Monteith commenced his inquiries. "Jamieson," said Monteith, "I happen to be acquainted with your niece, or, rather, your sister's step-child." "Are you, indeed?" replied Jamieson, pretending not to have been aware of the fact. "Yes," continued Monteith " while she was visiting at G--- , I was staying at my uncle's at the same time, and I spent many pleasant leisure hours in her company." "Did you?" replied Jamieson, with pretended* indifference. "Do you admire her disposition?" he continued. "That is a difficult question to answer: I thought once I knew her disposition; but now I begin to think I am totally unacquainted with it." "There are a great many others in the same dilemma; and there are but two to whom her disposition is really known, and they are myself and sister-we happen to be acquainted with her art." "Is Annie Wallace artful?" inquired Monteith. "Why, my dear sir, she is one of the most artful girls, con- sidering her age, I ever saw. I am sorry that I am under the necessity of expressing such an opinion concerning her; but I know, Monteith, that you have no interest in repeating what I say." "Certainly not," replied Monteith; " but I am surprised at your account of her." "Of course, she informed you of her engagement, and, at the same time, ridiculed her future husband," said Jamieson. "She never did,' answered Monteith; " but I was not aware, until this moment, that she was engaged." "She is, and expects to be married shortly, if she does not meet with some one she likes better. But I must go," said Jamieson. "Good-evening, Monteith." "Good-evening," replied Monteith, and they separated. About a week after the above conversation, Henry Monteith started for a walk. He turned his steps towards the Royal   PLOTTING.            89 Circus Place, and had just reached that aristocratic neighbor- hood, when a carriage drove past him. Henry looked up just in time to see that Annie Wallace was in the carriage, and bowed to him, but he saw her too late to return her salutation. Henry regretted that it had happened so; and, as he saw the carriage stop at Mrs. Wallace's door, he determined to call and apologize for not returning her salute. It did not require much resolution for him to do so, as he did not place implicit- confidence in what Jamieson had said, considering him a little too severe for an impartial judge. He arrived at the house, and, ringing the bell, inquired if Miss Annie was at home. "I believe she is," answered the servant; and he started to go to Annie's room, when Mrs. Wallace stopped him, and inquired who was at the door. "A gentleman that wishes to see Miss Annie," said the ser- vant. "Oh, yes; I understand. Annie does not wish to see him. Just go and tell him, that Miss Wallace says she cannot see him." The servant did as he was ordered, and informed Henry that Annie could not see him. Henry bowed politely as the servant delivered the message, but his eyes lighted up, and, as he left the marble steps, he muttered between his clenched teeth, "Fooled again. Ha, Miss Wallace, I will know what this means yet;" and with hurried steps he walked away. Since the conversation with Mrs. Wallace when riding, Annie had kept the room the most of the time, except when she went out for a drive; and several times she had great trouble in pre- venting Walter Jamieson from  accompanying her.  Annie de- pended upon herself alone for protection against the machinations of her step-mother, and the importunities of Jamieson. His forced attentions created a perfect hatred towards him inAnnie's heart; still he persisted, until Annie resolved that she would not speak to him at all. She determined not even to answer his     90         ANNIE WALLACE. questions; "For," said she, "if he is so lost to the finer feel- ings of a gentleman, that he will persist in pressing his attentions upon me, I will be under thd necessity of eschewing his acquaint- ance altogether. My doing so will not affect his heart much, though it may disturb his golden dreams, and trouble his money calculations. That same afternoon, after resolving not to allow any friendly intercourse between herself and Jamieson, she entered the parlor, which was occupied by Mrs. Wallace and her brother. The moment Walter saw Annie he rose and offered her a chair. In- stead of accepting it, she walked directly across the room, and took a seat upon the sofa. "What! what, Annie! why, what is the meaning of this?" said Jamieson. Annie said nothing. "Won't you take this seat?" No answer. "Why, what is the matter; have I offended you? Annie said nothing. "Are you determined not to answer me, and why? What have I done to merit such treatment?" Annie wanted to tell him, but she controlled her tongue and said nothing. During this scene, Mrs. Wallace sat looking on in surprise, until, at length, she thought it time to interfere. "Annie," said she, "what do you mean? Why don't you answer Walter?" "Because I have resolved not to," answered Annie. "Because you have resolved not to! Do you dare to treat any one thus in my house, especially my own brother?" "Yes, madam, I dare to treat him thus, and would treat him worse if I knew how." "Well, I think this is a pretty state of affairs, when you rise in such rebellion as this, and insult my relatives in my own house 3" "I suppose your relatives can insult me, and I must, be quiet?"   PLOTTING.            91 "Have I ever insulted you?" interposed Walter Jamieson. "Yes," said Annie, "you have insulted me: you have pressed upon me your hateful attentions. I have all but told you in words they were hateful; but you cared not. Bereft as you are of every fine feeling, you disregard my rebuffs, and con- tinue attentions which I will not receive. Had you been a man of honor, sir, the first time I refused your proposition of mar- riage, you would have desisted from making a second attempt." Walter Jamieson listened to Annie in silence, but not so his sister. Passion, overwhelming passion, tingled through every vein; her eyes almost emitted sparks, and some imaginative monomaniac would have sworn that he saw the sparks fly. Her face was pale, while about her lips and eyes rested leaden-colored circles. Her lips wer? compressed, and her whole appearance was that of a person in the very height of a demoniacal passion. Steadying her voice by a wonderful effort, she said  "Annie Wallace, you have insulted the memory of your dead father in myself and family; you have heaped insult upon me, and you shall eat your words--yes, eat them. If my brother will endure such a pest, you shall marry him." During this storm Annie remained perfectly calm. She was a fearless creature. In that she was a perfect heroine, and the greater the excitement the calmer she grew. Returning a glance as steady and as fiery as her mother's, Annie said: "I will not marry your brother-I detest him and you." "Beware!" screamed Mrs. Wallace, wrought up to a state of insane fury; "beware," she repeated, "lest I teach thee now I am thy mistress and thou my slave." Annie smiled contemptuously as she replied: "Your threaten- ings, Mrs. Wallace, are like your broth6r's pleadings, too shallow." We know not what would have been the consequences attend- ing Annie's last, bitter retort, had not Robert Jamieson entered the room just at that moment. "My dear sister," said he, and he lead her to a sofa, ' O, my dear sister, calm yourself!" Annie, upon the appearance of Robert Jamieson, left the par-     92         ANNIE WALLACE. lor, and, locking herself in her own room, threw herself upon the bed, and, sobbing passionately, she murmured, "Peter, oh, my dear brother Peter! O, would that thou wert here to protect your abused and outraged sister!"Tears soon came to her relief, and at last she fell asleep, with one bright crystal tear sparkling on her soft cheek. It was some time after Annie left the room before Mrs. Wal- lace regained her calmness; but finally controlling herself, she requested Walter to come with her to her room, where they remained together for the rest of the afternoon. CHAPTER XV, THE FTE---COLD LOOKS-SAD lIEARTS. "How are you, Jamieson?" said Henry Monteith, one evening, as they met at the club-rooms. "I am well," replied Jamieson. "You don't look well-you look as if you had been on short allowance for a month."' "So all my friends say; but nothing serious is the matter with me, only I have not slept much of late." "So I should suppose, if you are not sick; for it is evident that something is wrong." , "Do you intend going to Montgomery's eldest sister's birth- day fete?" "I do not think I shall." "' You had better make up your mind to go," said Jamieson; "Annie Wallace will be there, and you will have a good chance to see her flirt in public." "Is she really going?." inquired Monteith. She is," answered Jamieson; and the young men parted.   THE FETE--COLD LOOKS--SAD HEARTS.       93 Since Annie's last contention with her mother, Mrs. Wallace, for some unexplained reason, had been very pleasant in her man- ner towards her. She sought Annie's company upon every occa- sion. On the morning of the same day that the conversation just related took place between the young men, she entered Annie's room, and said kindly--  "Annie, do you intend accepting Mary Montgomery's invita- tion to her birth-day fete?" "I think not," replied Annie. "You had better, my dear," said her mother; '" a change will do you good. Now do go--just to oblige me. You will forget what passed some days since; will you not?" "I do not refuse to go on that account," she replied. The truth was, that Annie did not know how to interpret Mr. Monteith's conduct. He had never called to see her since his first visit, though he had promised to come again on the suc- ceeding day; she had bowed to him, when riding, but received no return (Annie was not aware that he had ever called), and if she went to Miss Montgomery's fete, Mr. Monteith might be there. She did not wish to see him, and yet she did wish to see him ; she still flattered herself that she was indifferent, although his image was constantly before her mind. At length Mrs. Wallace succeeded in persuading Annie to go, though she con- sented very reluctantly. Mr. Montgomery's house was situated in a retired portion of the city. It was a large, old-fashioned mansion, covering more space, but not so high, as houses are usually built in Edinburgh. It was night; the numerous candles were lighted, and tastefully arranged, so as to throw a brilliant flood of ligAthrough the apartments. Later in the evening, the gay company began to arrive-carriage after carriage rolled up to the door. Among the very last arrivals might have been seen the Wallace livery. As the footman opened the door Walter Jamieson stepped out, and as- sisted Mrs Wallace and Annie to alight, and they entered the house. The ladies were shown to the disrobing-room, while Jamieson awaited their return in the hall-a few minutes later,they were     "        ANNIE WALLACE. announced. Miss Montgomery, with whom Annie was very in- timate, came forward, and offered a very cordial welcome. Soon the festivities commenced, and Annie almost forgot her sorrows in the gay scene around her. During the course of the evening, a tall, fine-looking gentle- man addressed Walter Jamieson, and requested an introduction to Annie Wallace.  Walter politely complied, and, advancing towards Annie, presented Viscount Moray. Annie gracefully acknowledged the introduction when the viscount, addressing her, inquired," if she was the daughter of the late Captain Wal- lace?" Mrs. Wallace heard the inquiry, and answered-"Yes, this is his only daughter." Viscount Moray and Annie soon became engaged in an ani- mated conversation. The viscount was all admiration for his lively companion.  He solicited her hand for the next quadrille, which Annie promised. Annie had not forgotten Henry Mon- teith; but, among the many forms which passed her, she did not recognize one familiar face-indeed, the scene was all new to her. But soon was she whirling in the mazes of the dance. Many glances of admiration were cast upon the handsome couple, as lightly and gracefully they " tripped the light, fantastic toe." The excitement of the scene had, for the moment, banished from Annie's mind all thoughts of Monteith; indeed, she had come to the conclusion that he was not there, when a couple whirled past them in the giddy waltz. Annie's heart beat high as she recog- nized Henry Monteith and her friend Mary Montgomery. Henry saw Annie.  At the same  moment there was a slight change in the countenance of each, and they were separated by the dancers. Annie very soon complained of fatigue, and was led to her seat by the viscount, who, after a short time, excusing himself, left Annie, for a few moments, for the purpose of seek- ing Henry Monteith, between whom and himself there existed a sort of rivalry. He did not have to look far, as Henry, after conducting Miss Montgomery to a  seat, had placed himself-near Annie and the viscount; not with any definite object, but being   THE FETE--COLD LOOKS--SAD HEARTS.       95 unable to control the interest he felt in her movements. Annie Iwas all unconscious of this, and, after Moray left her, felt sad and weary of this gay crowd. "Good-evening, Henry. I begun to despair of your coming," ' I was detained," laconically answered Henry. "Have you seen Miss Wallace?" inquired the viscount, "I have had that pleasure previous to this evening," answered tenry, coldly. "What do you think of her?" asked Moray. "Not much," replied Henry, stiffly. "Why, I gave you credit for better taste, Henry," said the viscount; perceiving there was some pique in the matter, and dis- posed to banter his friend a little, he continued, " the sweet face of Annie Wallace is beautiful, in all its aspects, whether golden with sunshine or starlight, or dark with tempest." "Well," said Henry, " there are degrees as well as varieties of beauty, and some like one and some the other; and I, as an individual exercising the inalienable right of private judgment, must admit, that my taste goes for the sunshine and the stars, in the one case, and for ' wreathed smiles,' in the other. This is a mere matter of taste, of course," added Henry laughing, "and only to be regarded as such," "Now, Monteith, I do not believe you are candid. Your taste is biased by jealousy, is it not?" "I am not jealous, Moray," answered Henry. "You are surely blind, then. There is not a gentleman in the room who would differ from me," said Moray; $" and not a lady who would not yield the palm of beauty to her." "' You are mistaken," said Henry, coldly. Just at this moment Jamieson joinedthe two young men. "Come, Jamieson, I am trying to convince this prejudiced fel- low, that your niece is the handsomest lady in the room; but he disputes it." "You may think her handsome, while he does not," replied Jamieson; " it is only a difference of taste." "Well, it may be so," said Moray, " still I think Miss Wallace     96         ANNIE WALLACE. surpassingly beautiful;" and the admiring viscount returned to Annie.  When Jamieson was left alone with Monteith,:he continued the conversation with regard to Annie, artfully insinuating, by hints and inuendoes, Annie's disposition to coquetry. "The smile that fascinated the viscount," said he, " is equally dispensed to all.', "Yes," answered Henry, abstractedly, and turned away. Although Henry Monteith imagined that he disliked Annie, still he could not listen to Walter Jamieson's bitter remarks. MBonteith was anxious to get out of hearing of the hum of voices, an) the rustle of silk dresses, and as Viscount Moray repassed him, Henry inquired where he could find a quiet place. "In the card-room," replied the viscount. After stopping to converse with several acquaintances, Henry at last reached the card-room. As he entered the door, he met a lady coming out. "Good-evening, Mr. Monteith," said Annie, quickly. Mr. Monteith drew himself up, and bowing coldly, passed on. Annie knew instantly, that he had purposely avoided speaking; -she felt hurt and mortified, but, assuming a smile, she took the proffered arm of Robert Jamieson, who met her at that moment, and was soon lost in the crowd of guests. The moment Annie passed out of sight, Henry Monteith regretted what he had done. "For now," said he, "I have deprived her of any chance of explanation." The festivities continued. Annie and Mr. Monteith did not meet again during the evening. Weariness, in many of the guests, soon became apparent, and carriages began to roll away. At last the parlors were entirely deserted, and the old servant again w ent the round to extinguish the lights. Many left that house filled with sensations newhto themselves, but which had been experienced by their predecessors in the gay world, long before. One left burning with hatred, as the monster jealousy crowded at her heart; another, with the new and magic sensations of love thrilling her heart-strings, and tingling through her untutored nerves; while others departed with the same feel-   [HE FETE-,-COLD LOOKS-SAD HEARTS.       97 difference that they had left hundreds of other such iumphing in some new conquest, and filled with antici- r the next fete, when they again should be the cynosure      es; while some few were sad and dispirited.

THE OUTRAGE-PADRE OUTRAN. HENSaY MONTEIY, the day succeeding Miss Montgomery's fete, tried hard to summon sufficient resolution to seek an interview with Annie, to apologize for his conduct, and ask an explanation of her but he found it impossible to mate up his mind to do so, therefore he resolved to wait until circumstances should give him the opportunity, he sought.  That same day, Monteith received a call from the viscount, who informed him that he intended to spend three months on the continent, and invited Henry to accompany him. "When do you start, Moray?" asked Henry. "Not later than next week," answered the viscount. Henry had just learned, by letters, that his ship would not be in port in less time than eight months. He had not thought of leaving Edinburgh immediately, and the proposition was sudden; but, after a few moments' reflection, he determined to accept the visount's invitation-he felt that a change was desirable. Ac- cordingly he told Moray that he would bear him company, and they parted without any allusion to the previous evening. After the departure of Moray, Henry sat long-apparently absorbed in reflection. Reader, need we say that Annie Wallace was the subject of those reflections. Henry felt unhappy-- miserable. At one moment he blamed himself for his frigid, unbending demeanor towards Annie at the party; the next, the conviction, that Miss Wallace had trifled with him and slighted him, would press upon him with greater force, and he felt that any other course would be weak and unmanly. "Yes," said he, aloud, and rising from his seat, "I will go; I will not   " THE OUTRAGE-PADRE      OUTRAN.       99 ere, dangling after a heartless coquette; I will flee the d circle, ere, like the silly moth, I flit about the flame my wings scorched.

And Henry drew  up with an air of dignity, and, taking his hat, walked  stroll, after he had come to this very wise conclusion lution, laying the flattering unction to his soul, that he t-free and independent still.

And she turned towards the door, when Jamie- hrew his arms around her, and drew her to a seat beside ,If on the sofa.  'i     300      a V  ANNIE WALLACE.  ^ Let me go, sir," cried Annie, as she tried to free herself from his grasp.                           ; "Not until you have heard me. I love you-I cannot live   Fi without you, and I am determined to make you mine, though it  t, cost me life, honor, ay, everything. Submit cheerfully, and we may be happy. I will study nought but thy pleasure. I will be thy patient slave." Annie was wild with anger and excitement.           : "I would not claim thee as my dog!" exclaimed she, almost  ' : fiercely. "Be calm, be calm; do not talk so about your future hus- band," said Jamieson, still retaining his hold of her person. "Unhand me, sir, lest I scream for assistance." '"You shall be mine," Jamieson said through his compressed lips, "Never!" cried Annie, wild with terror, " except in death." A ' "In death, then," hissed Jamieson through his clenched teeth.,  "In heaven or hell, thou shalt be my wife-no power shall pre- vent it." Annie screamed wildly for help, and at this moment the door  opened, and Mrs. Wallace entered.               'i "Help! mother, help!" exclaimed Annie, pleadingly; but, at the first appearance of. Mrs. Wallace, Walter Jamieson loosened I his hold, and Annie regained her feet.             -  "Base, unfeeling wretch!" commenced Annie, when Mrs.    \  Wallace, who apparently controlled her feelings by a great -  I effort, interrupted her by saying:               I "Wait, Annie, let me speak." And, turning to her brother--  "Walter, what do you mean by such shameful behavior?" A strange sarcastic smile played around his lips, as he replied: "I thought I would get up a natural tableaux with Annie, for the i: ---P(rpose of creating a little excitement; for, 'pon my honor, sister, this Edinburgh is a mighty dull place." "Well, sir," continued Mrs. Wallace, "you are my brother; still, if you attempt such another shameful proceeding in my house, I will banish you from it and my presence forever. I am m ashamed of you-what on earth possesses you?"         '   THE OUTRAGE--PADRE OUTRAN.        101 "Annie possesses me," he replied, ironically. "I abominate you," replied Annie, with passionate earnestness. "Annie, my dear, go to your room," said Mrs. Wallace, affec- tionately: "I will see that such an outrage is never perpetrated again." Annie thanked her mother, and proceeded to her room, think- ing that there were some redeeming traits in the character of her step-mother. But oh, hoW wickedly had she been deceived! As she left the room, Mrs. Wallace burst into a merry laugh, which Annie might possibly have heard, had she been listening. As Annie closed her room door, Mrs. Wallace said: "You have worked admirably, Walter: so far, everything works well. But, really, you acted your part so well, I was nearly frightened myself. I think you can introduce your friend, Padre Outran, as there will be but little trouble in per- suading Annie to leave home again, if it be only to escape such a monster as you. But we must act quickly. Will you bring Padre Outran this afternoon?" "I will," returned the brother; " but you must call him Signore Outran, lest she be suspicious. She must not know that you are about to send her to a convent, or her hatred for the Catholics will overcome her dread of me." "I understand; we will say it is an institution of learning." "That will do," answered the brother; and they parted for the present. Later in the afternoon, Jamieson, who had been out most of the day, returned home in company with a tall, dignified-looking gentleman. The stranger, that accompanied Walter, must have been at least sixty-two or three years of age, though his form was still erect. His large gray eyes were as bright as they were at thirty, and required no artificial assistance to read the finest print, orT measure distances. For a man of his age, he was remarkably handsome and vigorous, though it was evident that he appreciated the luxuries of life. Jamieson and his companion, as they neared the house, walked slowly, and appeared to be engaged in earnest conversation.     102        ANNIE WALLACE. When they entered the front door, Walter requested the servant . to show the gentleman into the parlor, while he went in person to seek his sister, whom he found in her own room. He spoke a few words to her, and immediately she arose andcfollowed him to the parlor. When they entered the room, the stranger was standing before the mantel gazing at the portrait of Captain Wallace. Hearing the approaching steps, he turned round, when Walter introduced his sister, and, in return, he was intro- duced as Signore Outran. Signore Outran bowed gracefully in acknowledgment, and commenced the conversation by inquir- ing of Mrs. Wallace if the portrait, hanging over the mantel, was the likeness of her husband . Mrs. Wallace replied that it was, and, after some further general conversation, Signore Outran remarked that he believed Mrs. Wallace had a daughter whom she wished to put under his charge. "I have," answered Mrs. Wallace, "if I can make such arrangements as I wish regarding her." "I understand, madam," replied Signore Outran: " that mat- ter I believe I have satisfactorily arranged with your brother who informs me that it was the request of her father, when dying, that she should be united to him." "That is the case, signore. But how soon could you make arrangements to take her in charge?" ' I think that we can start for Italy in a few days, if we are not delayed by the young lady's preparations." "k Her preparations can be easily completed. I suppose," con- tinued Mrs. Wallace, " that it will be necessary for me to give you a check for her expenses, now."            n  "That is the best way, madam," replied the signore, whose   : eyes glistened at the mention of money.             r Going to the same massive bookcase which we have previously had occasion to describe, she took out a draft at sight, drawn upon Annie's guardians, and& handed it to Signore Outran, who e f remarked as he took it:                      - "I will call again about eight o'clock to-morrow morning, when I hope to see my future charge."   THE OUTRAGE-PADRE OUTRAN.         103 "VTe willexpect you," replied Mrs. Wallace; and, after bid- ding them adieu, the signore took his leave. As he walked towards his lodging, he muttered: "If I ohce get that young lady in Italy, I doubt whether she ever return to Scotland again, as the wife of Walter Jamieson or any one else. Her services and fortune, applied for the benefit of the church, will be better disposed of than it would be when used to admin- ister to the dissipated tastes of that confirmed villain, her step- uncle. By Jove, though, it'sa deep game they are playing; but I'll play a deeper, and I doubt not but that a disciple, grown gray in the service of the successor of the great Loyola, will be able to counterplot and outwit a Scotch widow." Such is the blindness of the wicked, and such are the pitfalls that beset their path of sin. The deep-plotting widow, for the better furtherance of her own purposes, blindly placed herself in the power of a subtle member of that terrible body of religionists known as the Society of Jesus. A Jesuit is never deterred by any obstacle, even though it require the sacrifice of human life to remove it, in the accomplishment of his deadly designs for the good of the body of which he is a part. After the departure of Signore Outran, the brother and sister remained together to complete their plans and congratulate each other upon the success that had thus far attended them. Oould the innocent son of that wicked Mrs. Wallace have known how his mother was damning her soul fc him, he would have folded his little hands together and prayed: "Father, take me to thyself, ' 9 that my mother may be deprived of the object of such great sin." The consultation of Mrs. Wallace and Walter was interrupted by the entrance of Annie. As she came in, Jamieson immediately rose, and left the apartment. "Come here, my dear," said Mrs. Wallace to Annie. Annie took a seat alongside of her mother, when MmS WFallce thus began: "My dear Annie, it makes my heart bleed to be kept in such continual excitement. My brother has just been upbraiding me for my interference, as he calls it, between you and himself.     104        ANNIE WALLACE. Annie, I will continue to interfere. I will never allow him to approach you. But, my dear, you can readily realize what con- tinual pain it causes me. Last night I lay the whole night, thinking how I could manage it so as to avoid an open rupture with my brother, and save you from his attentions. I have at last come to the conclusion that there is but one way, and that is for you to go away again, to finish your education." "I would willingly go," replied Annie, " could I go where I would be associated with young ladies of my own age." "Your Uncle Robert has informed me of just such a school in Italy, under the charge of a learned but kind gentleman, who is at present in Edinburgh. Do you think you would like to go as far as that?" "I would be delighted with such an arrangement," Annie an- swered, joyfully. "Well, my dear," your future instructor will be here to-mor- row morning at eight o'clock; you had better complete your arrangemnents so as to start immediately, as Signore Outran is anxious to return to Italy." A; "My arrangements are easily made," answered Annie; and, feeling hopeful once more, she returned to her room. Jamieson rejoined his sister the moment Annie left the parlor, when Mrs. Wallace informed him of Annie's ready acquiescence. Upon the following morning, Signore Outran called, according to appointment, and was introduced to Annie, who seemed much pleased with his appearance and manner. Annie felt that she could place confidence in him. Thus willingly does the bird yield to the fascination of the serpent who seeks its ruin. Oh, what a group was that, when Signore Outran rose to depart. He stood with his hand upon the door, and, as he looked upon his three companions, he could not smother a feeling of disgust that rose in his bosom, when he beheld the selfish countenances of the brother and sister. c"I will outwit them both," he thought to himself, as he smiled upon his dupes.  Walter Jamieson also smiled as his sordid mind penetrated the   Is      THE OUTRAGE-PADRE OUTRAN.         105 future. In his sister he saw his dupe, and in the signore, his accomplice. But most complacent was the smile that wreathed the beautiful lips of Mrs. Wallace, as she, too, penetrated the future, and saw her darling son possessed of wealth and inflq- ence, receiving the adulation of thousands. She looked upon the signore and Walter as her hirelings. The smiles of those three persons, to an outward observer, would have been significant only of mutual courtesy and respect; and none but God could penetrate their secret thoughts, and recognize in those smiles nought but homage to gold, and the foulest duplicity. There, too, stood Annie, with a smile of hope playing around her lips; and, as she stood amidst that trio of plotters, an invisible spirit, that could have penetrated the thoughts of man, would have seen in her an angel surrounded by fiends, panting for her blood. Two weeks subsequent to the events above related, Annie, under the charge of Signore Outran, started for Italy, intending i to stop a week at the classic city of Rome, and then proceed to the school. *     CHAPTER XVII. CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART. THREE miles west of the old city of Genoa, commanding a view of the snow-capped Alps, stands the Convent of the Sacred Heart. Upon a calm, balmy day in June, a close carriage stopped at the gate of the convent. The head and shoulders of a woman were protruded out of the partly-opened gate, as the carriage stopped. '"Come, come! hurry and open the gate, Marguerita," said one of the inmates. "Si, holy father," replied the woman. The next moment the gate opened, and the carriage rolled through its portals towards the main building. N "Who is that woman?" inquired a veiled lady within the car- riage, as they rolled by. "That is the porter's lodge," replied the elderly gentleman whom she had addressed. "The woman is the good Guido's wife." The carriage stopped at the arched entrance of the convent, and Signore Outran stepped out. He was followed by a lady, who, our readers will readily surmise, was Arnie Wallace. "What a gloomy-looking place," remarked Annie, as she cast her eyes upon the dull, dreary-looking building. "It is strange to you now, my dear lady: you will like it better when you have become accustomed to its solemn appear- ance.,' "I don't know; but I hope I shall," replied Annie, rather despondingly.   CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEBART.       1.07 The signore led the way through a low door, and proceed along an artificially-lighted passage, up a gloomy staircase, until they arrived at a door, upon which the signore rapped lightly three times. "Come in," said a musical female voice from within. The signore opened the door, and Annie was ushered into a narrow, but neatty-furnished, room. Sitting at a small table, was a young, noble-looking lady. As Annie and the rignore entered, she arose and said: "I greet thee, holy father." The signore bowed with dignity. Annie had not notied the salutation of the porter's wife when she called Signore Outran holy father; but, as the lady addressed him in the same manner, she looked from one to the other, and' cast her eyes restlessly about, when suddenly the truth flashed upon her mind, that she was in a convent. A cry of agony issued from her lips, as she fell heavily upon the floor. "Bring some water, Sister Isabella," cried the padre; for Signore Outran, as the reader must have already guessed, was a Jesuit priest. Sister Isabella rang a small bell, and, in a few momentr water was procured. As the padre bathed Annie's temples he said: "This lady, holy sister, must be treated with marked kindness, and you can win her to our holy faith. She is, unfortunately, a heretic, but possessed of great wealth. If matters are rightly managed, her services and wealth can be acquired for the benefit of the Church."                   - There was a strange light in the eyes of Sister Isabella as she replied: "I will mind thy words, holy father." "'Tis well," replied Padre Outran, as Annie opene her eyes and returned to consciousness. As she wonderingly looked about the room, she murmured, "They have deceived me." 'When she saw Sister Isabella, she turned a pleading look towards her and said: "Ohl! kind madam, will you not save me from them? I have *                             X*     108        ANNIE WALLACE. been deceived-cruelly deceived. Peter, my brother, come to me. But, no, no, thou canst not find me. Oh, Father of Mercy, take me to thyself. I am too weak to serve any purpose of thine here, and life has nought but bitterness to offer. Father take me to thyself." Sister Isabella stood watching Annie, and, as she finished her appeal, the same coldness that always beamed from her eyes lighted them now; yet for a moment-yes, just for a moment- there glimmered one spark of pity. She was a woman-she had a woman's heart; but her weakness was concealed from Padre Outran, who turned towards her and said: "Holy sister, I leave this fair being to your charge; adminis- ter consolation; teach her the vanities of the world, and the joys attending a life devoted to God. Deal gently with her, but,--" and he lowered his voice, and, bending towards her, he whis- pered, " by all means, win her to our holy faith." "I will do thy bidding," replied Sister Isabella, as Padre Outran left the room. Opening a door at the lower end of the room, she assisted Annie to lay down upon a bed, and whispered, "Weep not, my sister; I will befriend thee in a way thou little dreamest of. In me you have a friend; rest peacefully, and I will see you again after you have slept." Annie made no reply; and soon wept herself to sleep. Sister Isabella was the lady-abbess of the convent. She had met with a disappointment in her early years, and retired to a convent with a broken heart, as many had done before her, to find peace in a life devoted to God. She was of high family, and had brought great wealth to the Church. Upon the death of the lady-abbess, which occurred three years after she had taken the veil, she was installed in her place, though very young to hold  l such a position. Annie slept soundly for three full hours. When shb awoke, the lady-abbess was standing over her, gazing upon her face with a countenance full of sympathy. "Have you had a good rest, my dear?" inquired the lady- abbess.                              i   CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART.        109 "I slept very well," replied Annie, sadly. "Come with me to the outer room, will you? and we will have a nice little talk together." Annie arose and followed her. Pointing to a chair, she re- quested Annie to be seated, while she herself took a low stool. Taking Annie's hand kindly in her own, and assuming a sweet, cheerful smile, she asked ,Annie to give her some account of her past life. Won by the gentle manner of the lady-abbess, Annie told her history from the time she was first sent to Kilmarnock. The lady-abbess listened attentively, until Annie had finished, when she said:  "Well, my dear, never let any one, within or without the walls of the convent, become aware of what passes between you and myself. At some future day I will tell you much of my own history. But calm yourself, and pretend great depression of spirits for some weeks yet, as it will be necessary for us both to play the hypocrite to enable me to befriend you; for, Annie,. though I am a, Catholic, still, I do not assent to the immolation of young beings at your age. 'Tis well, when we are disgusted with the gaieties of life, to live thus, if we choose; but for a per- son of your age, there is still enjoyment without the walls of a convent. Annie, there is much dross in the happiness and plea- sures of the world; yet real happiness is to be found in a life of innocence, in the midst of this world's temptations." As the lady-abbess finished, she again rang a little silver bell, which she always kept by her. The bell was answered by a nun, whom   she addressed as sister Maria.  Taking Annie by the hand, she requested the sister to show Annie to her room, As they entered the room' assigned to Annie, her heart failed her, in spite of the assurances of the lady-abbess. After remaining a short time, to arrange her things in her cell- like apartment, she passed to the room of the lady-abbess, and requested permission to walk in the garden. Her request was granted, upon the condition that one of the elder sisters should accompany her. She consented, and sister Maria was sent as a guide. O     "O        ANNIE WALLACE. The moment Annie passed from beneath the gloomy walls of the convent, and beheld the calm sky, her spirit was soothed, her nerves strengthened, and her natural fearlessness and resolution returned. As she cast her eyes above, she seemed mighty in her- self; her step was firmer, her eyes brightened, and, once again, even within the walls of a dreary convent, she felt calm, and even happy; for hope again became strong within her. After wandering about the garden in silence for a few mo- ments, she turned, and addressed her companion in English, who replied in French, that she could not speak English. Annie then inquired, in French, how many ladies there were at present in the convent. "Twenty-three, for educational purposes alone," replied sister Maria. I-How many of them are expected to take the veil?" "It is to be hoped that they all will do so." "Ugh! only to think of being confined in such a gloomy place as this for one's life," said Annie, with a shudder. "You will soon become accustomed to the appearance of the convent." "No, I never should; I would not live long in such a wicked place." "Wicked place!" exclaimed the nun, in surprise; " why, Ma- demoiselle Annie, what is there more blessed than a life devoted to God?" "Nothing," replied Annie. "Why, then, do you call it a wicked place?" "Because I do not think that God ever intended that persons should build four square walls around them for the purpose of leading a passionless life of solitude, depriving themselves of comfort and social happiness. Such devotion is not the result of love, but a wrong notion of duty." "Ah! my dear mademoiselle, you do not look at it in the right light; the world, as you may be too young to know, is filled with wickedness and temptations, and, bVy choosing a life of solitude, we deny ourselves its pleasures to avoid its temptations."   CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART. "And, in so doing, it is my opinion," continued Annie, "that you go directly contrary to God's intentions. If there were no sin, there would be a state of perfection upon earth; were we all perfect, we would be equal, and merit those blessings which we now receive alone through the sovereign mercy of God. But God has willed it otherwise: he allows temptation to beset our paths that we may learn to hate sin for itself, and testify our love for him by leading a holy life among the wicked of earth." '"Ah! my dear mademoiselle, you are blind: you are too young to know of what you are talking.  As I have said be- fore, in devoting our lives to God, we Drove our love by denying ourselves the happiness-the hollow happiness-of the world." "Then, you think," said Annie, "that every one, who professes to be a follower of Christ, should leave the world, and seek exclusive retirement. I think," continued Annie, as her eyes brightened with excitement; "that such a life is one of supreme selfishness. It is securing God's grace for ourselves, and leaving our fellow-mortals to grovel in sin for the want of the example of the virtues of a Christian man or woman to induce them to imitate such virtues." "Oh, my dear mademoiselle, say no more. I cannot talk with thee; but I pray that thou mayest yet be won to the true faith." Annie said no more, and they returned. Annie, instead of going to evening prayers, remained in her own room, where she found some  plain fare.  After partaking sparingly, she threw herself upon the bed, and soon fell asleep. Annie had been in the convent two weeks, when, one evening, as she was walking in the garden alone, she was startled by the appearance of a  man coming towards her. Annie had been in the convent long enough to know that a  male was never ad- mitted except upon extraordinary occasions. Just as she was about to scream with affright, she was prevented by hearing her own name   pronounced; smothering her cry, though greatly frightened, she waited to see who he might be. The stranger     "2        ANNIE WALLACE. approached, and, throwing off his mask, disclosed the thin, pale face of Walter Jamieson. "My dear Annie," said he, "excuse me for surprising you thus." "I will excuse you upon one condition," answered Annie. "I will abide by it, Annie, be it what it may." A roguish smile played around Annie's lips, in spite of her irritation, as she replied: "Very well, then, Walter Jamieson, I will excuse you upon the condition that you depart as rapidly as possible, the same way you came."  "No trifling now, Annie," said Jamieson, as lEs eycs glittered fiercely. "So I say," Annie answered; " and as you promised to agree to my condition, I have excused you, and expect you to depart." "I do not consider such a condition, nor do I admit that you have excused me, as you will not allow me to remain. But I shll remain, Miss Wallace, and I shall call upon you fre- quently." "I shall return home, then." "Ha, ha! Annie," jeeringly laughed Jamieson, "you will never return to Scotland as Annie Wallace." What! dare you continue your insults, sir?" "Yes, Annie, I dare do anything now; you have made me desperate." "I should imagine you always were desperate." "Very well, be it so then, that matters not; but your step- mother, Annie, is not an angel, and she is triumphing in the success of her scheme. You were sent here to become my wife. There is no help for you, Annie; the laws of neither God nor man can avail you now; you are in a Jesuit convent, and you can only leave it as my wife. So beware how you treat me, for your liberty, ay, your very life, depend upon my word." "All this is no more than I expected from such a base, un- principled coward; still, you cannot frighten me, sir; I am as independent as I was before I came here."   PERSUASIONS, THE LETTER, AND DISCOVERY.     113 "Very well," laughed Jamieson, "we shall see. I will give you time. I am a patient man; but if you do not finally make up your mind to marry me, I will force the marriage vow from your lips." "I don't fear you," said Annie, as Jamieson hurried off. As she left the spot where she had held the interview with Jamieson, she fancied she heard a rustling among the brush- wood, but, seeing nothing, she hurried into the convent, sought the lady-abbess, and informed her of what had passed. Annie really did hear a rustling, as she supposed. As she passed into the house, Padre Outran left his place of conceal- ment, from which he had overheard the whole conversation of Annie and Jamieson, and followed into the house, muttering as he went along: "A pretty desperate character, that; but we'll match him yet." CHAPTER XVIII. PERSUASIONS, THE LETTER, AND DISCOVERY. A WEEK passed since the meeting in the garden, and Annie had seen nothing of Walter Jamieson. But she was miserable. When she did not have to put up with Jamieson's insults, she was forced to submit to Padre Outran's persuasions. Every day he spent'three hours with her, trying to win her to the true faith. When he was not there, sister Maria, who had conceived a sort of affection for Annie, performed his part, and the only comfort she ha(, was the half hour she spent daily with the lady-abbess, and the short time she was allowed to spend walking in the garden. One day she had just left the lady-abbess, when Padre Outran came to her room.     "4        ANNIE WALLACE. "Bon jour, mademoiselle," said the padre, with an air of    1 studied kindness. Annie bowed her head in acknowledgment, but made no reply. "I suppose you are as obstinate as usual, young lady," com- menced the padre, when he had seated himself. "I never wish to be obstinate in regard to anything," responded Annie; " yet I must admit that my prejudices against your creed are as strong as ever." ' I am sorry that you are so wedded to the world." ' I am not wedded to the world, holy father, if that be thy appellation; but I am wedded to the religion of my fathers." As usual, the padre continued with her a long time; but all his eloquence was wasted upon Annie. Suddenly rising to depart, the padre said: "Is it still useless to hope, my dear Miss Wallace, that you will learn the error of your ways." Annie, to whom that question had been repeated again and again, for the first time, in the presence of the padre, lost entire control of her patience, and she replied: '"Sir, I abhor and detest the Catholic religion and its min- isters." "Beware, beware, young lady!" exclaimed the padre, for the first time becoming excited, "lest God strike thee dead in judgment." "Thou, thyself, hast most reason to tremble, Signor Outran, lest He visit thee with a rod more terrible than a sudden judg- ment for thy base, deceptive arts. Thinkest thou, that I would be an acceptable worshiper at the throne of God, when won by fear and threats? No, sir! God desires the voluntary homage of a loving, obedient heart." "Again I warn thee, beware, young lady, lest my patience be exhausted by thy taunts." "I wish not to taunt thee; but I desire thee never to seek my presence again, as I despise thee, even in thy priestly garb; every word uttered from thy deceiving lips but increase my contempt for yourself and your belief."   PERSUASIONS, THE LETTER, AND DISCOVERY.     115 Padre Outran stood with his hand resting upon the table. As Annie proceeded, his face became paler, while his eyes shone with a fiendish light. When she had concluded, he slowly and distinctly said: "Miss Wallace, knowest thou Walter Jamieson ?" "I do," responded Annie. "I know him as thy equal in iniquity." "' What! rash girl, darest thou insult me thus again ? Know- est thou not that thou art in my power-alone and unprotected ?" " I know all that, sir priest, yet I'll brand thee for what thou art. Thy threats are received by my rising spirit, only as the stern, high rock, receives the ocean's spray.  I neither love thee, nor fear thee." " But you love Walter Jamieson," said the priest, maliciously. "Yes, as I do the serpent." " Well, you have your choice: to become a favored nun, or the wife of Walter Jamieson." "I will become neither," Annie answered. "But we will make you become one or the other. You have your choice--joy as a- nun, or misery as the wife of the veriest scoundrel that ever breathed." "Were you about to leave me, sir, when you arose?" inquired Annie. "I was," answered the priest. "Go, then." "I will, my dear lady, and when I  return, Jamieson  shall accompany me as your groom."    And the priest left the room. For some time after the departure of the priest, Annie sat silently gazing upon the floor; her thoughts were as gloomy  as her appearance. Now she could see why her step-mother had been so soft and affectionate.  " Yes," murmured Annie,   " they thought to win me, and now they think to force me, to marry Walter Jamieson. Marry him! I never will!  They can but kill me, and death is preferable to the disgrace and misery that would attend a marriage with such a  vile being.  Oh," continued Annie, had I been told that such deceit, such wickedness, could be per-    "6        ANNIE WALLACE. petrated by beings bearing the image of God, I should have dis- believed it. If the world is composed of such dispositions, then willingly will I meet death at their hands. I am resolved not to marry Jamieson. I know myself"--and she raised her hand to her brow--"I know myself too well," she repeated. "I am no coward; I do not fear them." Here Annie's cogitations were interrupted by a rap at the door. Rising hastily, she opened it, and admitted the lady- abbess. "How long have you been alone, my dear?" inauired the lady-abbess. "But a few moments," replied Annie. "Padre Outran has just left me." "Was the holy father successful in convincing thee?" "No; he convinced me of nothing, except that he is one of the most subtle, hypocritical men I ever knew." "; fear that you are governed by passion, Annie, when you speak thus." "No, dear lady, I have been left alone long enough to recover my. temper, had I lost it. But Signore Outran is a hypocrite. He countenanced, and even assisted, the wicked deception of my cruel step-mother, and now he offers me the choice, to become a nun or the wife of Walter Jamieson, of whom you have heard me speak." "I remember," replied the abbess; and, remaining a short time longer to converse with Annie, she bade her adieu, and Annie was again left to herself. Slipping on her hood, she went out into the garden for the purpose of taking her usual walk. She had proceeded some distance from the convent, and had just started to return, when, standing in the pathway just before her, she beheld Padre Outran and Jamieson, from whom she was con- cealed by an intervening hedge. Annie was startled, and knew not what to do; but, a moment's thought convinced her that she had better remain where she was, as the least movement would betray her presence. Jamieson and the priest were both excited, and both spoke   PERSUASIONS, THE LETTER, AND DISCOVERY.     117 loud enough for Annie to hear what was said. The first words Annie heard, were uttered by Jamieson in a fierce manner, evi- dently in reply to something that had been said by the padre. "If she have decided to take the veil, she had been led to do so by your treacherous persuasions; but, mind you, padre, she shall take no other veil but the bridal veil, in spite of you or all the Jesuit priests that ever forged a dying man's will, or cheated a widow of her all." "Beware, Jamieson, how you speak thus recklessly of the holy brotherhood of Jesus." "I will beware of nothing, holy padre, but your tricks and deviltries. It is unnecessary for you to put on such a hypocriti- cal air of pious horror. I am acquainted with thy iniquities, and the quenchless desire for money, of yourself and your holy brotherhood of Jesus, as you call them. I am no worshiper of any God, padre, but the god of self; still, I have sense enough to know, that if there be such a thing, as an Almighty God, he has created hell for such subtle, hypocrical, sanctimonious devils as you and your holy brotherhood. I am plain with thee, padre, that thou mayest know with whom thou dealest." "I know thee as well as thou pretendest to know me; still, for thy sister's sake, I'll not notice thy insinuations." "I care not to offend thee, padre; but I never spoke with more sincerity in my life. But, a truce to this wrangling, and let's to business. And now, my heaven-bound padre, I wish to see Miss Annie Wallace once or twice again, and if she continue to treat me with scorn, we must force her to speak the marriage vows, and thou shalt be liberally paid for thy trouble." "You can see her; and if you are still determined to proceed to such measures, I will assist you." As the priest finished, they walked away. Annie waited a few moments, until there was no possibility of meeting them, and then, stealing from her place of concealment, she hurried into the convent. She resolved upon her course of action; and what she determined to do, she would accomplish. The day following, Annie received a visit in her room from $l-         -        "8        ANNIE WALLACE. the impudent Jamieson. He opened the door without knocking, and, walking in, deliberately took a seat, while Annie stood look- ing at him in amazement, not thinking that he would be permit- ted to do such a thing. " Good-evening, Annie," said Jamieson, coolly. " Leave my room, sir," replied Annie. " Presently I will, my dear; but, before going, I wish to have a little quiet chat with you concerning that matter which has been broached between us several times before." " I wish to hold no communication with you at all, and I com- mand you to leave this room immediately." ' Why, my dear, I really wish you would repeat, your com- mand; you look so beautiful when speaking with such hauteur." Annie was in a dilemma: she knew if she called for help that no one would attend to her call; and, likewise, if she rang her bell, she could not expect that it would be answered. She per- ceived by his cool, insulting, self-possessed manner, tliat Padre Outran had arranged against all interruptions. Annie knew not what he might attempt, knowing that she was helplepss and in his power. Presently a thought struck her: she made a sudden resolve. Though she had never premeditately used deception in her life, she determined to do so upon this occasion. Looking towards Jamieson still proudly, she said: "You wish to marry me, sir ?" " I do," replied Jamieson, as his eyes glistened. " On condition that I become your wife, will you agree that I shall live separate from you, if I choose, after a year's trial ?" "Annie, I will consent to any condition that will make you my wife, though fully convinced that if devotion to you can induce you to remain with me, we will always live together." " Well, sir, I cannot give you an answer now: will you give me one week to think ?" " Oh, Annie! can you not decide in less time than a week; must I bear the agitations of suspense 9" " I cannot decide sooner." " Well, then, I will wait a week; and, Annie, though my con-   PERSUASIONS, THE LETTER, AND DISCOVERY.       119      \ duct may have been unkind, still when you are once my wife, you will learn that I can make as gentle a husband as I am a harsh lover." " I wish you to leave me now; as I want all the time allotted me to think, alone." Walter Jamieson arose, and, kindly bidding Annie adieu, left the room. As' the door closed behind him, Annie muttered: "We are both mortals-he a man, and I a woman. Yet, oh, what a strange bundle of contradictions is human nature! I refuse a request, and he is my enemy; I grant it, and he would die for me: still he professes love in both cases. Did he really love me, was he really willing to offer his life a sacrifice for me, and if such love is not grounded on selfishness, why will he not forea:o forcing me to marry, when I love not. Ah! if he loves, then he is influenced entirely by selfish motives and desires." For a long time Annie continued to meditate, until her thoughts turned upon Peter, her only brother. Unlocking a small mahog- any box that stood upon her table, she took therefrom a letter. It was from her idolized brother, Peter.  While she read it, tears forced their way down her cheeks. As she returned the letter to its place, her eye fell upon one whose address did not look like Peter's hand-writing. Wiping the tears from her eyes so as to see clearly, she read the superscription, written in a female hand: " CAPTAIN PATRICK WALLACE, " Royal Circus Place, " Edinburgh, " Scotland." How that letter had come into her box, she knew not; but, after thinking a while, she remembered, that once she had been reading Peter's letters to her mother. When she left the room, she had hastily caught up the letters from off the table; " And then I must, have taken this with them," she said to herself. Annie's curiosity prompted her to read the letter; but her honor     120        ANNIE WALLACE. forbade her to do so. But, as she tigned it over and over, she saw the remains of some writing that some one had evidently attempted to erase. Scanning it closely, she At last made out the name Penang. That induced her to open the letter without any further ceremony. The contents, which Annie read hurriedly, caused her to turn pale, while her eyes sparkled with hope-bright, strong hope. The letter was from the East Indies, and read thus:  "Lamont Estate, PULO, PENANG, January, 18-. "MY DEAR CAPTAIN WALLACE: "Since your departure from Penang, we have long and anxious- ly looked for a letter from you, but up to the present time we have received none. We know not the reason of your silence, and have, therefore, sent this letter, in hopes that it may find you enjoying perfect health and happiness. We are all anxious to hear from you and the two children. Noria, your step-child, and half-sister to your two children, prays every night that she may again see you and them." (The rest of the letter would be uninteresting to the readers. After writing about the affairs of his Indian relatives, the writer closed by saying:) "It is a special request of your father, Jose Marcella, that you would bequeath to his care his two grandchildren, in case of your death. If  wish, he will continue their education in Scotland, though he fears that the Scottish climate is too bleak and cold for them. "But, dear friend, I must close this letter with the hope that it will find you, and cause a reply. "In love and affectionate regard, "I remain yours, "SABELLA LAMONT. 'P.

A draft for their expenses will be accepted, if it be satisfactorily proven that the money is to be applied for the benefit of Peter and Annie Wallace.  Yours, "SABELLA LAMONT." This was the letter that had been shown to Robert Jamieson, as described in the scene related in our second chapter. After reading it, Annie sat long and earnestly thinking over its contents, until she at last resolved to fly, in secret, from the convent, and, alone and unprotected, proceed to Penang. The letter seemed like a message from heaven: it made her hope-it made her independent of any one. Again she was really happy; for, when a new hope first takes possession of the heart, who does not feel happy, and, for a brief period, bid adieu to care? CHAPTER    XIX. THE STRANGE MEETING--PLANS FOR ESCAPE. WE, would ask the reader to accompany us to the city of Genoa--three miles from the convent of the Sacred Heart. Standing on the steps of the Church of the Annunziana-the most superb specimen of architecture in Genoa-were three young men. One of them was Walter Jamieson; the other two were our old friends, Henry Monteith and the Viscount Moray, who had just met and exchanged greetings. "How long have you been in Italy?" inquired the viscount of Jamieson. "1 have been here about two months," replied Jamieson. And how did you leave Miss Wallace, your niece? or, rather, why did you not bring her to Italy with you?" "     122        ANNIE WALLACE. "I did," replied Jamieson; "she is at the convent of the Sacred Heart, where she intends to complete her education." Henry Monteith started, and every pulse beat with a quicker motion at the information that Annie Wallace was so near him. Since he had left Scotland, his mind had often reverted to the pleasant hours of intercourse with Annie at G---, where, with their horses, they had scampered over hill and dale; or, when they had rambled among the valleys and narrow glens, enjoying the rugged but romantic beauties of Scottish scenery. He remem- bered how frankly expressed, both in words and manner, was - Annie's pleasure in his society; and though he still continued to deceive himself with regard to the nature of his feelings towards her, yet he thought more favorably of her than at the time of his departure from Edinburgh. Often, when with the viscount he was gazing upon some object of grandeur and beauty, involun- tarily the thought, nay, the wish, would arise in his heart: 9 "Would that Annie were here with us, to enjoy these scenes." When Jamieson had so suddenly announced the presence of Annie in Italy, he found it impossible to keep down his heart's rapid pulsations, and he turned away to conceal his emotion; but, in spite of his precautions, Walter Jamieson saw the effect his communication had upon him, and a smile of triumph played around his lips, when he thought how soon he would lay claim to the hand and fortune of the rich heiress. "( What induced you to send your niece to a convent, Jamie- son? Are there not places enough for a young lady to complete her education, without burying her in a Jesuit convent?" "It was the young lady's own choice to be sent'there." "Why, surely she is not a Catholic!" answered the viscount quickly; for he had a perfect horror of priests and convents. "Oh, no, Annie is not a Catholic; it was only one of her whims." "Well, I think your sister is too indulgent when she gratifies such whims. But why are you stopping here? You cannot gain admittance to the convent to see her, can you?" "O, yes; I am permitted that favor once in a while."   THE STRANGE MEETING--PLANS FOR ESCAPE.      123 "By Jove! it's a strange affair, anyhow," said the viscount; "but come, Monteith, let's away to the hotel; I am expecting letters this morning." The young men bade adieu to Jamieson, and, arm-in-arm, walked leisurely to their hotel. Henry Monteith seemed lost in deep thought; but he was prevented the indulgence of his medi- tative mood by his talkative companion, who, giving Monteith a sudden tap on the shoulder, said: '"Come, Harry, you have got the blues: shake them off and listen to me; a new idea has just struck me, and I wish you to help me carry it out." "Well, what is it, Moray?" replied Henry, abstractedly. "Why, I believe that Jamieson is a black-hearted scoundrel, and his sister no better." "Do you really think so?" exclaimed Henry, pausing, and turning with surprise towards his companion. "I do; and, what is more, I suspect that all is not right in regard to this convent affair. You must know, Monteith, that this Miss Annie Wallace inherits great wealth, and I have heard it whispered about Edinburgh that Mrs. Wallace wishes to sell Annie's hand to this brother, for a specified Sum." "Is that so?" said Henry Monteith, the truth suddenly burst- ing upon his mind that Jamieson had tried to mislead him with regard to Annie, in order to be better able to carry out his own designs. "What a   fool I have been i" exclaimed Henry, as he pressed his hand with force upon his brow. "He  deceived me with an" object-the scoundrel!" "What, what, Harry!" said the viscount, in surprise. "Ha, ha, Monteith," he continued, "'the secret's out now, my boy; Annie Wallace's face is 'dark with tempest,' and does not suitR your taste; 'pon my honor, I  remember you had seen Annie Wallace before the Montgomerys' fete. Come, now, tell a straight. story, and we will see if we can make matters right." Henry needed but little persuasion. He knew-Viscount Moray     124         ANNIE WALLACE. O to be a friend; and so, without reserve, he gave- him the whole history of his acquaintance with Annie Wallace. When he had finished his recital, the viscount said: "'I see how it is Henry. Mrs. Barton has told the whole story of your -acquaintance at G---, and Walter Jamieson is the tool of Mrs. Wallace, for the purpose of preventing any further communica- tion between you." "I fully believe now, that such is the fact," answered Henry. "Well, then, the first thing to be done is, to manage, by some means, an interview with the young lady, and ascertain whether she voluntarily entered the convent, or /has been induced to go there through the artifices of her step-mdther and Jamieson." "But, after what has passed, you perceive it is impossible for me to seek an interview without some explanation," said Henry. "True, but I will go alone, and ascertain the state of the affair. I am certain that you have been deceived. I doubt if Miss Wallace is aware that you have ever called to see her since your first visit." "If that proves to be true, I will visit Walter Jamieson with the punishment he merits," said Henry, with considerable warmth. Moray smiled at his friend's vehemence of manner, and said, mischievously: "It seems to me that you take the matter up warmly for a friend. Harry, I wager my life you are in love with Miss Wallace." "Certainly I love her as a friend and sister. "Or a cousin. Well, never mind; be it brotherly, or cousinly, or what else, I prophecy that Annie is the ' dark-eyed maiden from a distant isle,' mentioned by the old crone who told your forthe." "You are mistaken," answered Henry, laconically. The young men had now reached their hotel, and, as they had expected, letters were awaiting them from Scotland. Henry also received one with the Portsmouth post-mark. Opening it hur- riedly, he perused the following order:   THE STRANGE MEETING--PLANS FOR ESCAPE. 125- "PORTSMOUTH, July 29th, 18-. "DEAR SIR: "You have been appointed to my ship, as first surgeon. We wish to sail three weeks from the date of this letter. I shall expect you on board. I have written to several other places, hoping that one of my communications will reach you. Please. accept my compliments, while I remain, c Yours, ' JOHN MALLISON. "Commander of His Majesty's ship St. George." ( HENRY MONTEITH." "This is unfortunate," muttered Henry, when he had finished the letter; "but, I suppose, I must submit without a murmur. Well, this decides the matter; the viscount and I will gain an entrance into the convent this evening, and find out how it is with Annie-my wronged-I mean, poor Annie Wallace." In a few minutes, Viscount Moray reentered the room. "My mind is made up to immediate action, viscount," said Henry; "-we must gain an entrance into that building this very night."- " All right, Monteith; I am ready to assist you." Towards evening, the young men completed their arrange- ments for scaling the walls of the convent. They had provided themselves with rope-ladders and armed themselves, so as to be ready for any emergency. About dusk, they passed out the western gate of the city, and proceeded a quarter of a mile from the town, where they found a man, whom they had previously engaged, holding two horses, which they mounted, and proceeded, with great rapidity, towards the convent. When Jamieson parted with Moray and Monteith, in ,e t morning, he proceeded straight to the convent of the Sacred Heart. A week had expired, and he anticipated the speedy' gratification of his wishes. "What will Monteith say, when he learns Annie Wallace -is my wife T" thought Jamieson. "And     126        ANNIE WALLACE. my amiable sister, how she will look when she sees me the happy husband of Annie Wallace, and the possessor of her vast estates. Let me see, that house in the Royal Circus Place is mentioned in the inventory as going to Annie. That, then, will be mine;" and he chuckled to himself as he imagined how he would bring down the patronizing airs othis sister. "Won't I play the gentleman; and how friends will flock around me." With such thoughts he reached the convent. Annie was in her room. "Good-evening, Annie," said he, as he entered. "( Good-evening," replied Annie, turning pale. "I have waited impatiently for the expiration of this week, and for the glad news that awaits me." "I must have one week more," said Annie.  "Impossible! my dear, impossible 1" exclaimed Jamieson. "What is impossible, sir? for me to have my own time to think of bestowing myself upon any man, or accepting him as my husband?" "Excuse me, Annie; I hardly meant what I said; still it is impossible for me to wait another week before I call you wife." The truth was, that Jamieson was not pleased at the appear- ance of Monteith in Genoa. As *e have said he remarked the sudden start when he mentioned that Annie was so near. He felt now quite certain that Henry felt a more than ordinary interest in Annie Wallace, and it would be very probable that he would make an effort to see her. He was not aware that he himself was suspected by the two young men of any foul play, for Moray had been upon his guard not to betray his doubts; but he did not know what events might occur within the space of a week to snatch the golden prize from his grasp, and he determined to secure it now, at any hazard: he was prepared, therefore, to with- stand all remonstrance and entreaty. Annie replied to his last remark by saying: "But you must wait, Mr. Jamieson; I cannot decide sooner." "I will not wait," answered Jamieson, in an irritated tone; "circumstances make it necessary that I insist upon an imme- diate performance of the ceremony."   THE STRANGE MEETING-PLANS .FOR ESCAPE.      127 ' I am very sorry that you are so obstinate; but if you will not wait, so let it be. Listen, then, to my decision: I willnever marry you, Walter Jamieson; and I will put my trust in God to deliver me from your malicious persecutions and mercenary projects."  "We will see, Miss Wallace-we will see," answered Jamie- son, in a voice of suppressed rage, and left the apartment. The remainder of the day,Annie, by special permission, spent with the lady-abbess; and, in the evening, as had been her regular habit, she again went to walk. She remained out until twilight, and then turned to retrace her steps to the convent, when a stranger suddenly stepped before her. Annie was fright- ened; but, thinking that it was Jamieson in disguise, she stood still, and calmly waited for him to speak. "Pardon this intrusion, mademoiselle; allow me one word, if you please," said the stranger. Annie thought she recognized the voice, though it was not Jamieson's, and she replied: "' Well, sir, what is your wish?" "Are you connected with this convent?" "No, sir," replied Annie. "Do you know a young lady named Annie Wallace, residing here?" "There is," said Annie, anxiously. "Will you carry a message to her?" said the stranger. "Annie Wallace is before you." The stranger, who had suspected as much, now dropped his mask, and Annie recognized Viscount Moray. Her heart beat rapidly. "Excuse me, Miss Wallace," said the viscount; "; I was not certain that it was my good fortune to address your veritable self; and a meeting with any other person would have been rather malapropos. This is rather an awkward visit; but I ascertained that you were here, and thought if I could carry any message for you, or help you in any way"-continued he, hesi- tatingly.     128        ANNIE WALLACE. "This is Viscount Moray, I believe." "I am the viscount," replied Moray. "You wish to know if you can help me in any way?" 'I do." "Well, sir, if you will rescue me from this horrid place, you will save me from a confinement worse than death--from daily insults and abuse from two of the most wicked men that ever lived." "( Ha, Miss Wallace, it is as we expected." "We!" repeated Annie; " why, then, have you company ,?" "I have a friend not far off." "And why did he not come with you? It is Mr. Monteith, I suppose." "It is he, Miss Wallace; but I am surprised at your being aware of that fact." t"I was not sure of it; but as I heard that you had left Edinburgh together, I supposed that he was with you." As Annie finished speaking, Monteith appeared, and offering his hand, said; "Good-evening, Miss Wallace." . Annie gave him her hand, but returned his salutation rather coolly. Henry, retaining her hand a moment in his own, said: "Will you forgive me, Miss Wallace, for the rudeness of my conduct when last we met?"                  A "Most willingly will I forgive you, Mr. Monteith; but I am at a loss to know the reason of your treatment." "We have been the victims of designing persons, Annie- excuse me -Miss Wallace; the second time I called on you-" Annie quickly interrupted him, by saying: "I never knew you called but once." "I allude to the day I saw you in the carriage. Were you not aware that I called that day?' "( No; I never knew that you called, except the day when I saw you." Henry then stated to Annie how he had been denied each time when he called. Annie, in return, related how she had been   THE STRANGE MEETING-PLANS FOR ESCAPE. 129 deceived and inveigled into the convent. After mutual explana- tions, the viscount again spoke' "Well, Miss Wallace, we must arrange for rescuing you from this place. To enable us to do so, it will be necessary for you to show me how to enter witlin those gloomy walls. We will leave' you here, Monteith: if you hear three whistles you may come." "Good-evening, Mr. Monteith," said Annie. "Good-evening," replied Monteith, with emotion, "keep up your courage, Miss Wallace, we will save you from this place, if we have to tear it down stone by stone; keep your courage, and remember that you have friends near." They parted, and Annie led Moray to the convent. Arriving at a low door, which- she opened by touching a spring, she expected himn to leave her, after she had shown him how the door was opened; but Viscount Moray was not satisfied, and, after lerning how to open the' door from the inside, he followed her along the damp, narrow passage, through the chapel, even up to her room. "Now Miss Wallace, I know enough of this place. To-mor- row, at dusk, be where you were to-night. If you be not there, I shall seek you here-knowing that something is the matter. How many males are there in this building?" "But one, that I have seen," replied Annie, "and that is Padre Outran." "Well, to-morrow be ready to leave this Jesuit hell. Good- evening-to-morrow at dusk. We will wait fifteen minutes after dark, and then we will enter. Again, good-night." The viscount had entered at a fortunate moment, and met no one in the passages. Hurrying back, he passed out the door he r had entered, and rejoined Henry. Highly elated with their success, they hurried back to the city, and entered one of the gates-the porter of which they had bribed to watch for them.     CHAPTER XX. THE CEREMONY INTERRUPTED--THE RECOGNITION AND ESCAPE. THE morning after the visit of Monteith and Moray to the convent, Jamieson and Padre Outran might have been seen leaving the city of Genoa, arm-in-arm. i Well, Jamieson," said the priest, " suppose I perform this ceremony, what sum will you pay me?" "One thousand pounds sterling," replied Jamieson. "Of course you will be willing to give a check in advance." ' Certainly," replied Jamieson; and, taking a bundle of papers from his pockets, he selected a draft from among them, and handed it to Padre Outran. It was drawn on Mrs. Wallace's bankers at Edinburgh. The priest eyed the check closely, and appearing satisfied with it, laid it along side of some other papers in a small book that he carried, and resumed the con- versation by saying: "I suppose you will want to leave thu convent to-night, im- mediately after the marriage?" "It is my intention to proceed to Edinburgh as rapidly as possible." "Well, I wish you joy, Jamieson." "Thank you." "This afternoon will settle the matter." "It will." Continuing thus to arrange their plans, these two subtle men reached the convent. Padre Outran proceeded immediately to the room of the lady-abbess. After exchanging mutual greet- ings, the padre said :   THE CEREMONY INTERRUPTED, ETC.       1-31 ' Holy sister, we will not be able to win that lady to our faith, and we must, therefore, fulfill the original contract, and force her to marry Jamieson."  ' You know, holy father, what is best, though I would advise you to return the young girl to her mother." "Ah, dear sister, her mother is even more unscrupulous than 'rle brother." "She is unfortunate." ' She is, in having such an obstinate disposition; but come, Sister Isabella, we will go together to her room, and see if we can prevail upon her to take the veil." '"I think it is useless to persuade her more; still, we can try;" and together they proceeded to Annie's room. Annie had just undergone the infliction pf another interview with Jamieson. He had besought, and entreated, and finally threatened, to induce her to marry him; but she was firm. When he left the room, his last words were: "To-night I will be here again, and if we have to carry you to the altar, you shall pronounce the vows that will make you mine." "And this is your love, Jamieson," ' said Annie. "It is," he replied, and rushed from the room. He had just left when Padre Outran and the lady-abbess entered. "My dear," commenced the abbess, "has that villain been- with you again?"         S "He has," replied Annie. "And what does he threaten," inquired the abbess. "He threatens, that if I do not Marry him willingly, he will have me carried to the altar, and tlere force me to speak the vows I will not."  "And how does he say he can do all that?"  "He asserts, dear lady, that you and Padre Outran are bound by solemn oaths to unite us, by fair or foul means." "He stated what is tr e," interposed Padre Outran. "Before your friends would agree to send you here, I had to bind myself     ]32        ANNIE WALLACE.. by oaths to marry you; yea, I was even forced to swear that I would accomplish their designs, though I even found it necessary b to go to such extremes as he threatens." "And did you, a teacher of the gentle precepts of Jesus, bind yourself by oaths to countenance and abet such atrocities?" C I did, my dear young lady, to save you. I knew that they were both unscrupulous, and would employ any means to accom- plish their purposes, and I bound myself to assist them, so that I might get you here and save you." '"Since I have been here, I do not think that you have acted as though you intended to save me; and you are bound by an oath to force the marriage." "Yes, but I can break my oath." "Well, what do you require of me to induce you to break your oath?" "' Save yourself from that villain, by becoming a daughter of the Lord." "And where will I spend the remainder of my life on earth, provided I take the veil?" "You will spend it here, where you will daily receive my Christian advice and the encouragement of our holy Sister Isa- bella. Oh! think what a blissful life it is, to be devoted to God and associated with saints on earth." "Sir, desist, and use no more blasphemy. Your advice!" continued she, contemptuously-'" what is the advice of such an arch fiend worth! You, who can swear to perform that at which Satan himself would shrink. You, whose word, whose very oath, is easily broken." "Hold! young lady; beware how you speak thus. "Oh! foul hypocrite, I know thee, and I despise thee and all within these walls, except the noble lady at your side." "Again I repeat my offer--will you take the veil?  I can break my oath for none but God: he will absolve me. Will you accept my offer?" continued he. "a No, I will not." "Then be ready; for at dusk you will become the wife of   THE CEREMONY INTERRUPTED, ETC.       133 Walter Jamieson." And the priest hurried from the cell, leav- ing the lady-abbess behind with Annie. - "Oh! my dear, dear Annie!" said the abbess, "I pity thee from my heart: I would give my own life to save thee; but I can do nothing-they will not give me time-you are lost, lost, and my heart bleeds for thee." "Hist! dear lady," responded Annie; "close that door, and I will then tell you what makes me so brave." The door was closed, and, looking earnestly at the lady-abbess, Annie said: "You are my friend." "I am, Annie." "Well, then, I will tell thee. to-night, two gallant young Scotchmen will be in the garden. They will wait fifteen minutes, and if I do not join them by that time, they'will enter the con- vent and rescue me by force." "Two young Scotchmen! how did they find out that you were here, and gain an entrance?" "You know," replied Annie, " that every evening I go out in the garden to walk. Last evening I went out as usual, and was returning to reenter the convent, when a stranger stepped before me in the pathway. He wore a mask, and I would have scream- ed, but, suppsoing it was Jamieson, I stood still and waited for him to speak; when the stranger inquired if I was one of the sisterhood, and connected with the convent. I replied that I was not. ' Is there a young lady confined there, named Annie Wallace?' I replied that there was. 'Can you,' said he, 'take a message to her?' 'Annie Wallace stands before you,' replied L The stranger dropped his mask, and imagine my joy and} sur- prise when I recognized a young gentleman of my acquaintance, Viscount Moray." "The -viscount who?" exclaimed the abbess, turning deadly pal. "The Viscount Moray," responded Annie. "Oh! great God of infinite mercy!" cried the abbess, as she sank down upon her chair. 12     134        ANNIE WALLACE. Annie was alarmed, confused, and surprised; but, regaining her self-possession, she caught up a tumbler of water and offered it to the abbess, who drank, and by a great effort regained her calmness. As soon as she was sufficiently recovered, Annie said: "What caused you such excitement at the mention of Vis- count Moray's name?" "It is a short story, Annie, and I will tell ypu. I am of English parentage, though I pass as being of French birth. My father was the Earl of---. When but eighteen years of age, I met the young Viscount Moray. He was one year older than myself. We loved, and were engaged; but we concealed our engagement for two years, until the viscount became of age, when he sought my father and asked my hand in marriage. My father turned him from the house with contempt and insults. It so happened that my father had never known that we wete acquainted. After the discovery of the engagement, we ascer- tained that a deadly feud existed between the two families. For two weeks after the scene with my father, we did not see each other; but upon the expiration of that time, we met secretly, and finally ran away with the intention of being married; but we were overtaken, and the viscount was wounded by my father. One footman, also, was killed. My father, in great rage, though a bigoted Protestant, sent me to this convent. I, too, was a Protestant. But I had not been here three months, before news reached me, from what I considered a reliable source, that the viscount had shot himself, and that my father had died in an apoplectic fit. "I wished not to return to the world; my life had been blighted; my heart broken; and my hopes destroyed, by the harshness of a kind but passionate parent. This convent afforded me a retreat from the irritations of life, and I resolved to avail myself of the retirement it afforded by becoming, in outward form and cere- monies, a Catholic, while, in my heart, I retained the pure, God- worshiping religion of my fathers. Shortly after taking the veil, a part of my estates I settled upon this convent, wAhile the   THE CEREMONY INTERRUPTED, ETC.       135 remainder, and some additional property to which I am heiress, are now held by my uncle for me, who visits me once in a while secretly. But, Annie, I made a wrong choice; the mockery that characterizes the ministers of the Catholic religion, and its hollow, senseless ceremonies, caused me more bitterness of spirit than I would have experienced had I led a retired life among my fellow- beings. Often have I thought I would resign my position and- break my oaths, which were meaningless, and which heaven could not have recognized or accepted, and return to the Wvorld. But, since I have put myself in their power, it will require a mightier effort than can be made by a weak, defenseless girl to free me from the misery, the annoyance, which that terrible body of Jesuits would occasion me. Thus, you see, Annie, why the mentioning of the name of the Viscount Moray caused me to be- come so greatly excited." Annie had listened attentively ;' and, when the abbess finished, at her request, she related the remainder of her interview with Morey and Monteith, and stated how the viscount had even fol- lowed her to her room door. It was late in the afternoon before the lady-abbess left Annie's room. After her departure Annie sat for two hours alone, when the door opened, and Walter Jamieson entered. "Come, my bride," said he; "come to the bridal." Annie neither moved nor replied. "Come, my dear," continued Jamieson, coaxingly; "don't force me to carry you to the chapel."  '4Walter Jamieson, you dare not attempt anything of that kind," said Annie. "Dare, my dear young lady; see what I dare;" and he caught her in his arms. Annie struggled to free herself, and at the same time screamed for help; but her struggles were ineffectual, and her cries for help ; unheeded. Rapidly Jamieson bore her to the chapel, where stood the priest, Padre Outran, and several of the nuns. Jamie- son carried Annie up to the altar, and stood her on her feet by his side. Padre Outran looked pale and dignified. Jamieson     136        ANNIE WALLACE. signified, by a motion of his head, to proceed, when he com- menced the ceremony, by reading the marriage-service of the 'Catholic Church; and, turning to Annie, said: "Will you take this man to be your wedded husband?" "I will not," replied Annie. "Ypu consent," and, turning to Walter Jamieson, he repeated the same question. "Will you take this lady to be your lawful and wedded wife 9" "I will," was the firm reply.              x ,' Hear me, all ye here assembled," said Annie. "I say I will not consent to this marriage." "It is too late to retract now, dear Jady," said Padre Outran. "But I never did consent," exclaimed Annie. "Can any one show reasons why I should not pronounce these two persons before me, husband and wife?" There was a dead silence. For form sake alone the priest repeated the query, when all were startled by the firm reply- I CAN!" "All eyes were turned in the direction whence the answer pro- ceeded, when they recognized the lady-abbess. "What have you to say in objection, Sister Isabella?" in- quired Padre Outran. " This lady has refused to allow the consummation of the mar- riage, and that is sufficient." "You are mistaken, holy sister," answered the priest; "and I must proceed." "6 You, Walter Jamieson, and Annie Wallace-" The priest was here interrupted by the lady-abbess, who rushed forward and dashed the book from his hands. Jamieson, enraged by her interference, beyond all control, raised his clenched fist and struck her to the floor. "Dastardly coward," shouted the Viscount Moray, who, just at that moment, rushed into the chapel. "Mean, dastardly coward," he repeated, and, raising his pistol, he dealt the sur-   THE CEREMONY INTERRUPTED, ETC.       137 prised Jamieson a blow with the butt-end of it which laid him senseless upon the stone floor of the chapel. Padre Outran drew a pistol from under his priestly garb, and, taking deliberate aim, fired at the viscount; but Monteith knocked his arm up at the right moment to save the viscount, and buried his own poignard in the padre's bosom. During the melee,' the nuns had fled to the convent, and Annie had fainted. The moment the padre fell, Monteith ran to raise Annie, while the viscount passed to the assistance of the abbess. As he glanced at her pale features, his heart beat rapidly, when suddenly, with a wild cry, he threw himself upon his knees, and, raising her head, he kissed her cold brow, and murmured, "My Julia." Annie soon revived, and, after explaining to the surprised Monteith the conduct of Moray, she brought some water from an urn that stood upon the altar, with which the viscount bathed the temples of the abbess. Upon the application of the water, she partially revived, when, catching her up in his arms, the viscounts told Monteith to follow , and he hurriedly led the way from the convent, through the passage previously described. The cool evening air revived the abbess sufficiently to enable her to walk. Arriving at the wall, the gentlemen first assisted the ladies -to pass over, by means of rope-ladders; then quickly following, they hurried the ladies a short distance from the con- vent, where they found a close carriage.' Assisting them to get in, Henry Monteith sprang upon the box, and, seizing the reins, urged the horses to their best speed. Twenty minutes brought them to the city, when, checking his horses, he drove at a slower pace. The carriage stopped at a small house, in a retired, unfrequented part of the town. Return- ing the reins to the driver, Henry leaped off the box, and rapped at the door of the house. It was opened by an old woman, who inquired:  "Art thou there?"   . "Yes," answered Monteith, and he returned and assisted the ladies into the house.     138        ANNIE WALLACE. "( Now drive for your life," called Moray to the driver, who was the last one to get out. Giving his horses a smart lash with the whip, the footman drove rapidly away as the door of the little house closed behind the newly-arrived party. CHAPTER XXI. THE PURSUIT AND DOUBLE ESCAPE. HENRY 1MONTEITH and Viscount Moray, the day after their first adventure in the gardens of the convent, made all their arrangements for the adventurous work of rescuing Annie Wal- lace. Monteith, since Annie's explanation, reproached himself continually for his treatment of her. The young gentlemen were walking together through the streets, arm-in-arm, when Henry Monteith suddenly exclaimed: "Why, viscount, what are we to do with Annie Wallace after we have taken her from that place?" "By Jove," replied the viscount, "that is an important ques- tion. We cannot take her to the hotel, that is certain; especial- ly if either one of us should lose our temper, and knock the breath out of either of those two villains-Jamieson or the  priest." For some time neither spoke. Both were trying to think of some plan to dispose of Annie, when the. viscount, suddenly brightening up, exclaimed: ' I have it now, Ttonteith-come with me ;" and together they hurried to a small stone house in the eastern part of the city. The viscount rapped at the door, when it was opened by a young girl. "Is thy mother at home, signora?" inquired the viscount.   THE PURSUIT AND DOUBLE ESCAPE.       139 "She is, signore," answered the girl. "Can I see her?" "Not unless you send your name, signore." The viscount took a card from his pocket, and wrote on it: "MADAME- GRILLA : "Allow me a few moments' interview. I wish to see you on important business. J         "VISCOUNT MOREY."  Handing the card to the young girl, he desired her to carry it to her mother. "Si, signore," replied the girl, and she closed the door upon the two gentlemen. "Polite, certainly," said Monteith. The door opened in a few moments, and   e girl reap- peared. "My mother will see you, signore" said the girl, and she led the way into a small parlor, furnished after the English fashion. They waited a few moments, and Madame Grilla appeared. The lady bade them good-morning, speaking in French. Morey returned her greeting in the same language, and immediately explained the object of their visit. "Then this lady, I am to understand," said Madame Girilla, ' you wish to leave in my charge." "We do," replied the viscount. "Well, I will do my best to make things comfortable for her, so long as she remains with me." "Supposing that it should be necessary for myself and friend to fly from Italy, can you save this lady from being retaken to the convent, and assist her to escape to England?" "I can guarantee that she will fall into no further trouble while she remains under my guardianship." "Well, then, to-night you may expect us; and, handing Madame Grilla a purse of money, the young men took their departure, and returned immediately to their hotel. After writ- ing some letters and arranging all their affairs, in view of any     "O        ANNIE WALLACEo mischance that might befall them, they passed the time in amuse- ment until five o'clock in the afternoon, when they started for the convent. To scale the wall and enter the garden was the work of a few moments; and, after waiting half the time appointed for Annie's approach, they were startled by a wild scream. Moray rushed forward, followed by Monteith. Being guided by the sound, t-hey reached the chapel as described, and rescued Annie and the lady-abbess, and carried them in safety to the house of Madame Grilla. After they had entered the house, Moray led the abbess aside, and hurried explanations passed between them; but their conver- sation was interrupted by Monteith, who said to Moray that it behooved them to hasten to their hotel. Bidding Annie and the abbess adieu, they left. They had not proceeded far on their way, when they were startled by the cry: "There go the murder- ous villains." Turning his head, Monteith recognized Jamieson, leading a platoon of police. There was but one alternative--to be captured or run: they chose the latter, and started at a rapid pace for the wharf, hotly pursued by the whole squad of officials. The young Scotchmen were active and athletic; and they had little difficulty in distancing all but one of their pursuers, who gained rapidly upon them. Moray, hearing the nearer approach- ing footsteps of the ambitious policeman, turned his head and saw they had lost sight of all but this one adventurous fellow. An instant's thought convinced him of the necessity of disposing of this one. Imperceptibly lessening his speed, he allowed the officer to gain on him. Monteith, observing Moray's decreased speed, and thinking that he was tired out, hung back, also, to assist him, or share his fate; seeing this, Moray overtook him, and said: "Go on, Monteith; I'm good yet; I have an object in view;" and he again diminished his speed. Rapidly the policeman gained upon him; three steps more would bring him within reach, when the viscount suddenly stepped one side, and, as the man rushed by, unable to check himself, the viscount dealt him a   THE PURSUIT AND DOUBLE ESCAPE.       141 blow with the butt-end of his pistol, which sent him headlong upon the stones. As they reached the wharf, they observed a man standing with his arms folded, gazing earnestly out upon the water, who seemed to be trying to penetrate the darkness, to discover an approach- ing object. Presently the steady stroke of an oar informed them that he was waiting for a boat. Approaching the stranger, Mon- teith observed that he was not an Italian, and, therefore, addressed him in English:     * "Are you an Englishman, sir?" said Jo hurriedly. "Do not deem my question impertinent; I will render satisfactory reasons for asking." "I am an American," replied the stranger. "Are you connected with any vessel now in port?9 continued Monteith. "I am commander of a brig," answered the stranger. "Would you afford refuge on your vessel for two English subjects?" "It will be impossible, sir--I sail to-night." "May I inquire to what port?" "I am going to England." "To England?" cried both the young men, in a breath. "Will you take passengers?" "I don't know but what I would, if they were honest men." Henry Monteith explained the circumstances to the American captain, who was a tall, handsome, generous fellow. "Well, gentlemen," said he, when Henry had finished, "you are welcome to accompany me; but we cannot wait for bag- gage." "Nor for the ladies?" inquired Moray. "Well, gentlemen," replied- the spirited captain, "if the ladies are not safe with that Madame Grilla, we will wait at all hazards. But the fact is," he continued, "I have got to make tracks, too, as, half an hour ago, .I put an ounce of lead through one of these damned meddlesome foreign minions, and there is a chance for me to steal out now without getting raked to splinters,     "2        ANNIE WAILACE. provided I can lift my anchor within half an hour." At that moment the prow of the jolly-boat struck the. wharf. "Will you accompany me, or shall I go without you?" said the captain. The two young men hesitated whether to avail themselves of the chance to escape; but finally concluding that the ladies would be safer where they were, than they would be if they attempted to put them on board the vessel, and knowing they could be of no service, and, possibly, a detriment by remaining, they accepted the captain's offer, and sprang into the boat as the crew resumed their oars. As they hauled away from the wharf, a number of the police force arrived, and fired several shots, without effect. A few more strokes brought the boat to the side of the vessel. As Henry Monteith's eye fell upon her graceful proportions, he could not smother a cry of admiration. The captain smiled proudly at their criticisms upon his vessel; and, half an hour after- wards, the graceful little ship sustained her character as she glided swiftly and smoothly out to sea. When Jamieson returned to consciousness, he found the chapel deserted by all, except Padre Outran, who was lying on the fior, bleeding profusely. Raising himself, though still weak, he wept to the padre, who still retained his senses. "Shall I send for a physician, padre?" said Jamieson. "No, fool!" answered the priest, with Jesuit coolness and determination. "Go to the city and make a complaint of mur- der against those two young men before they have a chance to leave the city." "The idea is a good one," muttered Jamieson. "Annie is mine, yet;" and hastening from the convent, he proceeded as rapidly as possible to the city; and, going to the proper place, entered a complaint of murder against Henry Monteith and Viscount Moray. A platoon of policemen were immediately O             -   THE MYSTERIOUS KINGrS ROOM, ETC.     143 dispatched to the hotel where the young men were reported to be stopping. But, before they reached it, they met the persons of whom they were in search. Jamieson witnessed the flight of the young Scotchmen, and it was he that had fired at them. Much disappointed and enraged at the result of his machina- tions, Jamieson returned from the chase, still hopeful-knowing that Annie must be concealed somewhere in the city-and he swore by all that was holy he would have her again in his power within twenty-four hours. CHAPTER   XXII.           / THE MYSTERIOUS KINGS' ROOM--THE PASSAGE TO ENGLAND. THE morning after their rescue, Annie and the abbess, or Julia Cresslington, as we shall now call her, awoke to find them selves in a small, but comfortable and handsomely furnished room. They arose and commenced their toilette, intending to be in readiness to fly with Monteith and Moray from the city. "I cannot realize," said Annie, " that you are the lady-abbess of the convent of the Sacred Heart. Only think of an abbess running away with a young Scotch viscount. It seems too strange to be true." "Ah, my dear Annie, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction; still, I do not think there is anything so very strange in my flight from the convent; several have been known to do the same thing before me." "Well, it is strange, for all that. But for what earthly reason are you putting on that nun's dress again t" "Why, I have no other, Annie." ' Try one of mine." Annie, in anticipation of her flight, had     "4 "4     ANNIE WALLACE. made up a change of wearing-apparel, and secreted the packat in the garden during the day, and, notwithstanding their has flight, it had been secured. "Now do arrange your hair diffe ently," continued Annie.      a   u  I will try the dress first, and then you may fx my hair t suit your own taste." Accordingly, Julia made choice of one of Annie's dresses which fitted admirably they being nearly of the same size; an( another halfhour was spent in curling and laiting, when Anni almost screamed with surprise and deliht at the improvemen these little alterations had made. Julia r eally looked beau tiful. "Why, Julia," exclaimed Annie, "how much younger you look; tell me how old you are."       youngeryou "I am twenty-four, answered the ex-abbess. "Well, you don't look older now, but that dreary dress did make you look old-maidish enough. What will the viscount say when he sees you?" "I do not know, Annie; I am not thinking about that. I am afraid they are in trouble, unless they have been fortunate enough to escape. At all events, I do not think it would be safe for them to come here again." "Why?" inquired Annie. "Oh, Annie," replied Julia, "you do not know how terrible those Jesuits are, nor to what cruel extremes they will resort to accomplish their diabolical schemes; one would think they were ubiquitous, so perfect is their knowledge of the movements of any whom it concerns them to watch. I only wonder how we have escaped, and tremble lest I fall again in their power; I shall not feel safe until our feet press the soil of England." Annie listened in breathless silence while Julia was speaking, and, after a moment replied:              . "There may be danger for us yet; but they would not dare interfere with Henry and the viscount." "Ohb you do not know them, Annie," said Julia; "they are not brave, but subtle--and blood was spilled last night."   THE MYSTERIOUS KING'S ROOM, ETC.      145 "True," replied Annie, turning pale; "I did not think of that. O, I hope they will not run any risk to come here." At this moment, a rap at the door interrupted the conversa- tion. Comein," said Annie. It was Genevra-Madame Grilla's daughter-who came to announce breakfast, and deliver a letter  that Monteith had returned and left. It was directed to Annie. "Why did you not deliver this before?" asked Annie. "You had retired, signora," returned the girl. Annie unfolded the letter, and read: "DEAR MSS WALLACE: "If we should not return, you may know that we have been captured, or have found it necessary to make a precipitate es- cape. In either case, you can place implicit confidence in Madame Grilla, who will provide for your safe return to Eng- 1-nd  In haste,  Respectfully yours, "HENRY MONTEITH." After reading this note, Annie passed it to Julia, who also perused it. They then followed the girl to the breakfast-room, oppressed with anxiety concerningttheir two young friends. They stated their fears to Madame Grilla, and she promised to send out during the day, and ascertain what had befallen them. Accordingly, after the morning meal was concluded, she sent her daughter Genevra to gain what intelligence she could, and, at the same time, to make some purchases for the two ladies. The girl was gone two or three hours; when she returned, she stated that they had both escaped on board an American brig, after having been pursued and fired upon. "Did you ascertain the name of the person who entered com- plaint against them?" inquired Annie. "Si, signora," answered the girl; "his name was Jamieson; I saw him, and heard him say he would find Annie Wallace before 9  nightfall." Annie turned pale at the mention of his evil intentions; but she was reassured by Madame Grilla, who said: 13     "6        ANNIE WALLACE. "Do not feel alarmed; he cannot find out that you are here, and, if he should, it will avail him nothing ;" and added, as they were leaving the room: "If you desire anything, make it known to me; your wishes shall be complied with immediately." Annie and Julia expressed their sense of Madame Grilla's kindness and attention, and retired to their little room, where they occupied the morning in fitting the disguises in which they intended to make their escape from Genoa-the materials for which had been purchased by Genevra, During the day they were kept cognizant of the various rumors that were afloat con- cerning the flight of the lady-abbess, and a nun-who had just taken the veil-from the convent of the Sacred Heart. Some of these reports approached the truth, while others were so exag- gerated, that if Annie had heard them related a year later, she could not have recognized one of the actors in herself. One fact was joined with each report, namely, that the Padre Outran was dead. The same night of their escape from the con- vent a murder had been perpetrated, and rumor, with her hundred tongues, attributed both these acts to the same persons. Late in the afternoon, feeling much fatigued-the consequence of being so steadily employed-Annie and her companion left their apartment, and went down stairs to the parlor. In crossing the hall, Annie observed the front door unclosed, and thoughtlessly stepped forward to shut it, when, just passing the house, she saw Walter Jamieson: he, too, recognized her. Annie screamed, and hastily closed the door, and put down the bar which con- stituted the fastening, at-the same time that Jamieson sprang under the portico. Madame Grilla was startled by the shriek, ^i r   and rushed into the hall, when Annie explained what had occurred. ':     "Go to your room, ladies; go immediately," exclaimed Ma- dame Grilla. Annie and Julia hurried up stairs, as Madame Grilla opened the door, in answer to Jamieson's repeated knocks. "What is it, signore," said Madame.   THE MYSTERIOUS KINGrS ROOM, ETC.      147 "I am addressing the mistress of the house, am I not?" said Jamieson. "You are, signore," responded the lady. "I saw my niece here as I passed the house; you may-not be aware of the fact, but she is a runaway from the convent." "There is no lady here, signore." "But I saw her; she closed the door." "That was my daughter, signore." "'Do not attempt to deceive me, nor tell me any lies," said Jamieson, his face flushed with anger and excitement. "If you think I -wish to lie to thee or deceive thee, signore, go from my house. I did not ask thee here, or desire thy presence." "Beware, I tell you, madame; it is best for you to surrender this girl to me, or I will cause you trouble." "Go thou from my house, signore. I'll not listen to thy in- sults."' Walter Jamieson saw- that he was dealing with a person not easily intimidated; and, although he knew he had seen Annie, he did not think best to persist further, for he did not know, from Madame Grilla's fearless deportment, what resistance he might meet; but he left the house, uttering threats and curses, and fully resolved to return immediately and force the delivery of Annie Wallace into his hands. Madame Grilla said nothing, but closed the door quietly, and, hastening up the stairs, she called to Annie and Julia, who, almost paralyzed with terror at their imminent danger, had shrunk ,into a corner of the room, clasped in each other's arms. Madame Grilla bade them follow her, and she turned into a back-room on the first floor; stooping down in one corner ofthe room, she raised a trap-door, and, calling her daughter, desired her to show the ladies to the king's room. Annie and her companion hesitated at first, but, remembering what Monteith had said in the -note- You can place implicit confidence in Madame Grilla'"-they followed Genevra down the' steps. Upon arriving at the bottom they found themselves in a. dark, damp, vault-like place.     "8        ANNIE WALLACE. "Wait," said Genevra; "I have come without a light ;" and she reascended the stone steps. In a few moments she returned, and, after feeling round the wall for some time, she touched a spring--a door opened and disclosed a dark passage-way. Pass- ing through the door, they groped their way along the narrow place. Annie and Julia both felt uncomfortable and oppressed. As they stumbled along, the damp air chilled them through; and, after traversing several windings and turns in this corridor, Genevra again touched a spring, which opened a door in the floor of the passage. Passing down another flight of steps, they found themselves in a passage similar to the one they had just left; again they groped along tremblingly, almost unnerved with sus- pense and apprehension, when, suddenly, they stepped into a large, open space. Genevra told the ladies to stand where they were, and, going herself across the room, she took a lamp from off a shelf, and lighted it. The increased light for a moment dazzled their eyes, but, after a little time, becoming used to its glaring rays, they cast their eyes about, and both uttered excla- mations of surprise, upon finding themselves in an apartment provided with rich furniture and drapery-the room was about twenty feet in length. Genevra, after pointing the ladies to a seat, went to the fire-place and commenced kindling a fire, while Annie and Julia, with wondering looks, examined the room and its furniture. "What room is this, Genevra?" said Annie, for the first time speaking since leaving daylight. "I don't know as ought to tell, signora," responded Genevra; "but, if you will promise me never to mention the existence of such a place, I will tell you?" "We, will never mention it," replied both the ladies. "Well," began Genevra, just as she finished kindling the fire, "one hundred years ago a certain nobleman was banished from Genoa, and he, in revenge, resolved to dethrone the prince, and establish a republic. It was he that caused this place to be built, for the purpose of concealing himself and his associates. It took three years to complete it. He was a wicked, unprincipled man,   THE MYSTERIOUS KING'S ROOM, ETC.      149 and all the-workmen, engaged in building this place, but one, were poisoned through his malicious contrivance, so as to pre- vent their divulging the secret of its existence. My great-grand- father was one of the workmen employed, and the only one who escaped being murdered. The treason of the nobleman was finally discovered, and soon after, he, with all the others to whom this place was known, were either executed or banished. So my ancestor bought the house that conceals the entrance, and it has remained in our family ever since." "Where are we now?" inquired Annie, interest and anxiety expressed in her countenance. "We are about twenty feet below the surface of the earth, be- neath a spot which is at least fifty yards distant from the house. That wall," said she, pointing to another part of the room, " has a concealed spring, which opens a door into a passage leading twenty yards further on to an outlet near the bay. So, lady, have no fear of that bad man. I must now return. Signora, if you want anything, pull that bell-wire; you will be heard. Do not be alarmed; you are perfectly safe; and -my mother or my- self will soon join you." With these words the quiet, useful Italian girl hurried away. We will leave Annie and Julia in their under-ground retreat, and return with Genevra, and note the execution of Jamieson's threat, that he would return and force Annie's delivery into his power. When he left the house he had taken the precaution to set a watch about it, to prevent Annie's escape during 1i absence. After sending Annie and Julia to the " king's room," as Mad- ame Grilla termed it, she sat down quietly, in expectation of Jamieson's return. Nor was she disappointed. This bold, bad man was prompt to execute the evil his wicked heart had de- vised. All good impulses, for the present, seemed utterly crushed in his bosom, and a settled determination not to relin- quish his pursuit of the friendless orphan until he had made hiM f master of her immense wealth, banished every principle of manly feeling from his unscrupulous conscience. It was not     150        ANNIE WALLACE. long before Madame Grilla heard his rap at the front door. She arose and admitted him, together with two others. "Well, madame, I have come for my niece-do you still deny that she is here?" "Si, signore." "Then you will allow me to search the house, to satisfy my- self that such is the fact." "I will allow nothing, signore," replied the lady. "What you do, is at your peril." "It is useless to attempt to intimidate me by your threats," replied he. "These persons have authority to make the search." Madame Grilla, without answering, retired into the parlor and closed the door, leaving Jamieson and his myrmidons standing in the hall. "We will search the house," said Jamieson, addressing the men. "I know my niece is here; but, in case we do not find her, we will take the woman off with us, and make her tell where she is to be found." "We will examine every part of the house, signore," replied one of the men; "but we can do no more, we have no au- thority." And, accordingly, every room, nook and corner was searched and pried into; but neither Annie Wallace nor her companion, nor, indeed, any trace of them was found, as mad- ame had put everything beneath the trap-door, which could lead to the least suspicion of their presence. The officer began to think they were on a wild-goose chase, while Jamieson cursed and swore like a demon; but all to no purpose. At last the search was discontinued, and Jamieson reluctantly left the house. When they had gone, Madame Grilla sent Genevra to the office of her son, who was a Genoese shipper, to inquire if there were any vessel bound for England. In case there were, Genevra was directed to give a letter to her brother, which stated the circum- stances of Annie's flight, and requested him to explain matters to the captain, and gain if possible, his protection for the ladies.   THE MYSTERIOUS KING S ROOM, ETC.       151 Signore Grilla returned answer, that there was a vessel about to sail to England the next morning, and he promised to arrange matters as directed, if possible. He also directed that, unless- they received another communication, contradicting the present arrangement, they should meet him on the quay an hour after dusk-appointing a signal for their recognition.   S i As soon as Madame Grilla had made herself acquainted with these instructions, she opened the trap-door, through which the ladies had descended, and sent Genevra to lead them up into their own room. Genevra found them anxiously waiting her appearance. So long a time had elapsed since she had left them, that their terri- fied imaginations conjured up the most alarming contingencies. Perhaps the good Madame Grilla and her daughter had been seized by the Holy Inquisition, and they would be left there to perish. These, and other fantasies of the same direful import, filled their young hearts with indescribable terror, and they were just about to make an effort to find the spring in the opposite wall, to which Glenevra had drawn their attention, and endeavor to escape by the outlet, when she entered their place of refuge. "Oh! why did you stay so long, Genevra " exclaimed they. "We despaired of seeing you again." "Did I not tell you there was no danger, dear ladies " said Genevra; and she proceeded to give them a lively description of Jamieson's hunt for them, and his subsequent rage and disap- pointment. ' Annie could not refrain from laughing, in spite of her fears, Caat Jamieson's chagrin and mortification, as they arose and most gladly followed the young girl out of the damp, dark place, which had afforded them such certain security against his cruel purposes. Upon reaching their own room, they found Madame Grilla awaiting them, who told them, in as few words as possible, the plans she had laid for their escape, and, taking up some articles of male attire from a table, "These," she said, ' young ladies, are the disguises I have procured for you."     152        ANNIE WALLACE. Julia took the clothes in her hand to examine them, when  Madame Grilla said, impatiently: "You must not stop to look at them, but put them on as quickly as possible. The utmost dispatch is necessary; you must be on board the vessel to-night. Pack up whatever you wish to take with you, and I will see it is carried on board." With much hesitation and demurring, the young girls at last consented to assume the male attire. By this time, it was near dusk, and they prepared to retrace their steps through the subterranean passages toward the outlet, as it would have been altogether unsafe for them to leave the house by the ordinary mode of ingress and egress. "Why, Julia," said Annie, playfully, "what a pretty boy you are." "Am I?" responded Julia. "Come, boys," said Madame Grilla, "you must not waste more time; here is your cousin Carlo come to escort you on your way"-pointing to Genevra who entered the room at this moment, after having made selections from her brother's ward- robe. Annie and Julia kindly bade adieu to Madame Grilla, and followed Genevra again through the trap-door, and along the mysterious windings of the lower passages, until they came to the outlet. After they emerged into open air, a short walk brought them to the place appointed for meeting. Signore Grilla was waiting for them with a boat containing four men. A few hasty words were said, a hurried adieu to Genevra, and they stepped into the boat, and in a very short time ascended the deck of the vessel in which they were to sail. It so happened that the commander of this vessel was also an American. As they stepped upon the deck, he came forward to meet them, and led them immediately to their state-room. They found the few articles of wearing apparel, which consti- tn'ted their scanty wardrobe, had been sent before them; they, therefore, hastily resumed their usual dresses, and, declining a summons to the captain's room to take refreshment, they re-   AT SEA-THE COOL YANKEE-FOILED.       153 signed themselves to a sense of security which had long been to them a stranger. Sleep, "tired nature's sweet restorer," soon came to relieve their weariness and exhaustion of body and mind. CHAPTER XXIII. AT SEA--THE COOL YANKEE-FOILED. THE next morning at a very early hour, Annie and Julia were awakened with no very agreeable sensations. Before they could arise voluntarily, they were very unceremoniously thrown from their berths. After considerable trouble they managed to get dressed, and then attempted to go out upon the deck; but find- ing it impossible to retain' their feet, they remained below, and at last reached the cabin without any serious mishap. At the cabin door they were met by Captain Sands, a fine-looking, middle- aged man, with fine blue eyes, ruddy complexion, and open, generous expression of countenance. The captain smiled good- humoredly as he saw the extraordinary afforts the young ladies made to keep their feet and gain a seat. "Good-morning, ladies," said he; "the rollicking gait of our noble old vessel makes it a difficult matter for you to ge& about."                        I "Very difficult," said Annie, as she grasped the nearest object, to keep from falling. "It will be pleasanter this afternoon, and we will fetch her down to an easier pace by that time, although its blustering weather now." "Are we at sea?" inquired 5ulia. Well, I rather guess we are," replied the captain; ; I don't     164        ANNIE WALLACE. think bay or river would make the old "Grapeshot" stagger in this way." "Why, is not this a poor vessel!" said Julia. "A poor vessel, miss; she will overhaul any vessel that sails on these seas;" and the captain went on deck. After partaking of a light breakfast, the ladies returned to their state-room, and remained there the rest of the morning-the rolling and pitching of the ship causing no very agreeable sensation or anticipations. About noon the vessel rode easier on the waves, and they found less trouble in keeping an erect position; but while Julia suffered severely from sea-sickness, Annie experienced less inconvenience, and was able to go about where she pleased, without risk of breaking her limbs. "Come, Julia, let us try the deck again." "I cannot, Annie," replied Julia; "I am too sick." "But the fresh sea-air will revive you," rejoined Annie. "Oh! this is horrid," continued Julia, with a shudder. "Horrid enough, Julia; yet we are better okf tossed upon the waves than in that miserable convent." "Dear Annie, do not recall that-place to my memory, I pray you; I feel strangely every time I think of it," said Julia "' But are you not glad to get away from such a place?" asked Annie. "Oh, yes, I am too glad; still, Annie, I cannot forget that I bound myself by oaths to devote my life to God; and, although those vows were uttered in a Jesuit convent, I feel at times as if I had cast off my allegiance to God, and, as a judgment, would be left to myself." "My dear Julia, you can have no reasonable regrets for leav- ing that place; you can still devote your life to God among sincere and righteous people. You can be an incitement to those about you, by precept and example; and you can do God greater service in this world, than by a life of selfish retirement in a convent." "I thank you, Annie, for your words of comfort. My mind has become fettered and warped since I have been shut out from   AT SEA-TlE COOL YANKEE-FOILED.       155 the world; and, I dare say, I am incapable of forming a right judgment; but, only think, the Holy Sister Isabella, Lady-abbess, of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, on board a vessel bound-for England, forsaking my religious vows, to enter into new engage- ments to mortal man!" "To a very gallant and amiable young gentleman, you mean," said Annie. "Well, Annie, I hope I am doing right, and, if God does not forsake me, I will still endeavor to lead a life of piety and usefulness." \ "That is right Julia; you must consider the past three years as wasted-wrongly spent; that, as lady-abbess of the convent, you were giving countenance to those wicked priests; and that now you are returning to your duty, and fulfilling a previous compact, by becoming the wife of a noble Scottish gentleman. But come, let us go on deck ;" and, taking her hand, she led the sick and desponding Julia to the companion-way. This time, the girls had little difficulty in getting along. As they reached the deck, they cast their eyes about in delight at the scene before them. The day was beautiful. The fresh air of the open sea animated their mental and physical energies. An expression of admiration burst from Annie's lips as she looked around. The gentle motion of the vessel, as she floated on before a favorable wind, hardly left a ripple on the surface of the waves. All was calm and serene. A few fleecy clouds were slowly rising above the western horizon, tinged with the reflected glow of an Italian sun; and Annie, for the first time since she had left G----, experienced a sensation of unrestrained happiness, when, turning to address a remark to her companion, she beheld Walter Jamieson, standing with folded arms, looking out upon the sea. An exclamation of horror escaped her, which attracted his atten- tion, and, turning round, he recognized them. A smile of triumph played around his lips, as he turned his steps towards them. "Come back to the cabin, Jilia," said Annie, seeing his approach.     156        ANNIE WALLACE. "No," responded Julia; " it is better to remain here. If he annoy us, we will appeal to the captain for protection." "O, the captain is leagued with him; I know he is. What shall we do! Oh, come-come!" -cried Annie, in a voice of agony, while she attempted to draw Julia away. Jamieson had now approached near enough to address them. "Good-evening, my dear Annie-my darling little runaway bride; and you, too,.my devout lady-abbess ; how are you both?" said Jamieson. "We wish to hold no intercourse with you, sir," replied Julia. i"Yes, but I do not reciprocate that wish. Of course I shall ; not insist that you acknowledge my acquaintance; but my niece, Miss Annie Wallace, cannot refuse to do so." "I hate you!" exclaimed Annie, vehemently. "Yes, my dear," replied Jamieson; "I know that you profess to, but-" "Mr. Jamieson," interrupted Julia, "I desire you to leave us." "And I, my lady-abbess," answered Jamieson, angrily, " desire that you will attend to your own concerns, and forbear inter- fering between my niece and myself." "I will call in more important interference, sir, if you do not allow us to pass without further molestation." Jamieson started. It suddenly occurred to him that Monteith and Moray might be on board; but he was no coward; and, though he would rather have avoided an encounter with the young Scotchmen, still he was not sufficiently fearful to pre- vent his going any lengths to gain the golden prize; and he said: "Do not threaten, madam. I do not fear, your friends, and would not submit to their interference sooner than I will to yours." "As you please, sir; but we shall pass on;" and Julia attempted to move forward, followed by Annie, when Jamieson caught Annie by the hand and drew her back. One of the   AT SEA--THE COOL YANKEE--FOILED.      157 crew was standing near,%and Julia called on him for assist- ance. "Oh, pray, sir," said she, " won't you protect this lady from a ruffian?" "Avast there, stranger. I rather guess that gal declines your civilities." "Mind your business, fellow;" said Jamieson, turning fiercely toward the man. "Wal, that's just what I'm doin'." ' Fool! do you dare insult a gentleman? I think it will require the nine-tails to bring you to order." "And by the same token, as Paddy sa)s, my meat-lumps will be called into action, to bring you to give that lady her freedom. Come, square round, old hoss." Jamieson let go his hold of Annie's hand, as the broad-shoul- dered Yankee came towards him, apparently with the intention of putting his threat into execution; but, seeing that Annie was free, the Yankee was satisfied, and walked away, intending to return to his duties; but Jamieson called him back. "What is it, stranger?" said the fellow, with the greatest equanimity. "Do you know who that lady is?" inquired Jamieson, point- ing to Annie, as she ran away from him. "Wal, no, friend; I can't say that I ever seed her afore." "She is my niece," said Jamieson. "Glad on it," responded the Yankee. "Then why do you interfere between my ward and my-. self?" "Because she asked me tew; and I never disregard a lady's cry for help." "But I tell you she is my niece." "Don't care: she knows whether she wishes your company or not; she is not bound to own you." 4: But she must," said Jamieson. "Wal, stranger, right is right; and you argue in favor of an infringement of personal right, I take it," said the man. 1-4     158        ANNIE WALLACE. "Where did you get your ideas of right?" said Jamieson, with a sneer. "Where do you think?" replied the offended seaman, sharply. "Tha  t is what I asked you, sir," said Jamieson. "Wal, stranger, if you don't know where an American gets his notions of right, you're mighty ignorant, that's all." And the man turned to leave him again; when Jamieson the second time called him back. "I do not want any trouble," said he; " so, if you will mind your own business, I will give you twenty-five pounds sterling." "I was going about my business when you called me back. Now look a here: if you want to insult a man from my coun- try, just offer him money to do a mean, dirty action." ("Then I suppose there are no more Arnolds," said Jamieson, tauntingly. "Yes, stranger, I guess you're of that breed; seeing you would buy principles, I calculate you would sell 'em." . "You have escaped this time, Sir Yankee," said Jamieson, pale with anger; " but if you interfere with me again, you will get an ounce of lead as a bonus." "All right: I see you have not tasted salt water yet; but you try your tricks here and may be you won't get a ducking;" and the independent fellow walked away. Jamieson turned upon his heel, and, seeing the captain for- ward, he went to him. "Good-day, captain," said he. The captain returned his salutation, and, in the same breath, gave an order to one of the men. Jamieson, seeing that he was not about to gain his undivided attention, again addressed him: "I wish to complain of one of your men, captain." The captain turned abruptly towards him, and said: "What did you say, sir?" "One of your men, sir, has been particularly insolent to me." "Well, sir," said the captain, looking surprised, " which one of the men was it .'   THE' DEPARITURE FOR PENANG.       159 "That fellow, who stands a little behind you," pointing to the man. "Why, that is Mr. Bardwell, my second mate-and a clever fellow, too," answered the captain, in surprise. "A second mate?" said Jamieson. "Ay, sir," responded the captain. At this moment, Bardwell approached the spot where the cap- tain and Jamieson were standing. "Mr. Bardwell," said the captain, " this gentleman complains that you have insulted him." Mr. Bardwell, in reply, stated what had occurred. Jamieson attempted to justify himself on the ground of relationship to Annie; but the captain, turning to him, said: "Mr. Jamieson, I fully justify Mr. Bardwell; and, further, wish you to understand that no intrusion or annoyance will be permitted towards the ladies in question, while they remain pas- sengers on board my ship."   And the captain walked away, followed by his mate, without waiting a reply. CHAPTER XXIV, THE DEPARTURE FOR PENANG. DURING the remainder of the voyage to Liverpool, Annie and her companion, Julia Cresslington, were comparatively free from any annoyance from Walter Jamieson. He had once tried to enter into conversation with Annie, and even to terrify her by threats; but the firm stand taken by the captain prevented him from any persistence in such a course, and he was forced to leave them unmolested. After a prosperous voyage, and without further incident worth relating, the "Grapeshot" hauled into her dock at Liverpool, and     160       ANNIE WALLACE. Annie and her companion, by politeness of Captain Sands, were safely ensconced in a suit of pleasant rooms, at a hotel. An hour after their arrival, and when Annie was just congratulating herself at a final escape from the persecuting attentions of Jamie- son, the door was opened by a servant, and that individual very coolly walked into the room, unannounced. Annie rose to her feet, dumb with astonishment at the cool pertinacity and unpar- alleled impudence of his conduct. l "Good-evening, Annie; I have come to take you in charge, and assure you a safe conduct to Edinburgh." "I will not pretend to thank you, even, for your officious offer of escort, sir; but request that you will leave me, and never intrude your hateful presence again upon my sight." "You seem to forget, Annie," said he, with a desperate ob- stinacy of purpose, " that you are my affianced wife; and, fur- thermore, please to remember that we are now in England, and not on board a ship, where the captain's will is supreme--in a land of laws, and where hle law will compel you to fulfill your contract. I shall commence suit against your chivalrous Cap- tain Champion for his interferende." "Go and do what you please, Walter Jamieson; I defy you. I never entered into any contract with you ; and, ignorant as I may be of law, common-sense teaches me that the laws of old England will protect me against your avaricious designs. Go, sir: I do not fear you now; you are beneath contempt." And Annie retired through another door, leading to her sleeping- room, leaving Jamieson alone. He was forced to retire, vowing deep vengeance upon those who had frustrated his plans. "It is surprising," said Julia, who had overheard the conver- sation, from an adjoining room, " the persevering impudence that fellow has. He surely cannot think that here, out of the reach of Jesuit subtlety, he can still prosecute his intentions." "I care not what he thinks," replied Annie, in a free, fearless tone. "I am out of his power now, and will soon be beyondf his reach." "How, Annie; what mean you?" inquired Julia.   THE DEPARTURE FOR PENANG.        161 "I mean, Julia, that I intend to take passage in the first vessel bound to the East Indies, in order to reach the island of Penang, where I have kind rlatives, anxious for my welfare. There he dare not molest me, even should be so daring as to follow me." "Won't you return to Edinburgh, at all?" said Julia. ( No," replied Annie; "I will never return there." At that moment, a rap was heard at the outer door, and An- nie, not knowing but her persecutor had returned, arose and opened it, when Viscount Moray, who had just heard of their arrival, entered. He bowed to Annie, and, the next moment clasped the happy Julia in his arms. One long kiss sealed this happy meeting; and the viscount and Julia, by an effort, cut short a scene which they felt could not be as interesting to a third person as them- selves; and, resuming their usual dignity, Moray took the opportunity to inform Annie that Henry had not been in Liver- pool two hours before he met the captain of the St. George, and, that same evening, was forced to accompany him to Portsmoutli, as the vessel was to sail in a few days. Annie, after a few moments, spent in mutual inquiries and congratulations, excused herself-judging, very naturally, that the lovers would prefer to be left to themselves-and passed into an adjoining room. As the door closed behind her, Moray passed his arm around- Julia, and, for a few moments, a wild, deep throb of love and happiness pervaded each bosom, and prevented the utterance of a single word. Moray, as he drew her to him, in a closer embrace, pressed one long kiss upon her lips; another, 'and another followed, and Julia--why-she answered by the same     mute sign of affection. "Dear Julia," said Moray, " there is nothing now, that I can see, to prevent our immhediate union." "Dear Edgar, do you forget my vows?  Surely, I must be released first from these." "I remember that Julia Cresslington, five years since, vowed t        162        ANNIE WALLACE.  That she would become my own dear wife. I have never released "er from that contract, and I consider any other null and void that conflicts with it." "Well, Edgar, give me a short time to decide upon this mat- ter. Deeply, devotedly as I love you, my own dearest wishes must yield to paramount duties."  "Julia," said Moray, bitterly, "you have never loved me. I have loved you with no boyish passion, but with the deep, enduriAg strength of man's affection, and you talk to me of vows and paramount duties. No--no, Julia Cresslington, you never loved me!" "Loved you?" said Julia. "O, how have I deserved this from you, Edgar? You know not the agony I have suffered these long years; the crushed and broken spirit that led me So take these vows; but," said she, rising and throwing herself into his arms, "you are the arbiter of my fate. Take me, dear Ed- gar; do as you will; I trust entirely to your noble heart; my scruples may be altogether foolish and wrong, and you are better able to judge. Do you not forgive me?" said she, look- ing up at Moray, who had not attempted to interrupt her, and was silently gazing upon her face. Moray saw the contest that was going on within her mind. He could not but admire the spirit of rectitude that would prompt her to sacrifice self at the shrine of duty, although it was so opposed to his own warm impulses, and he answered her in the same generous spirit, as he drew her in a closer embrace. "I have nothing to forgive, dearest. You have not offended me at all. If you can confide entirely in my judgment, and put full reliance in me, without trenching upon your own principles of right, then I will say be mine, at once; if not, I will wait patiently until all your doubts are removed, hoping that a short time will suffice to enable you to take the same view of the mat- ter that I do." "No, dear Edgar, I will not put you to this test. New light has broken in upon my mind, while you have been speaking. I am yours when you choose to claim me. Not one foolish doubt   THE DEPARTURE FOR PENANG.        163 remains"--and Julia placed her hand within his. Moray raised it to his lips, and answered: "To-morrow, then, my darling lassie, I will be here at twelve o'clock, and we will have a private ceremony in the church of ---- . There is the greater necessity for this haste, as it is absolutely necessary that you and Annie have a protector. By-  the way, has Annie decided upon any course?" "She is going to the island of Penang, where she has near relatives," answered Julia. Before Moray could answer, a rap at the door announced some new visitor. Moray arose and opened the door, when Captain Sands, of the *"Grapeshot," presented himself, and inquir- ed for Annie.              / "Good-morning, Captain Sands," said Julia, stepping forward, and offering her hand. "Come in, sir; FAnnie will be glad to see you ;" and, after presenting him to the viscount, she went to call Annie. "Good-morning, Miss Wallace," said the captain, rising, and shaking her hand, with a seaman's hearty cordiality. Annie gave him both her hands, as she returned his saluta- tion. His kind protection and attentions on board the ship had completely won her affection. She felt she was looking upon the face of a friend, and very few was the number of such poor Annie could count at present. After a few moments, passed in general conversation, Annie inquired if he had been successful in obtaining a passage for her. "Well, yes, Miss Wallace; if you like to take another trip with me," said the captain, "I think your passage is secured." "I shall consider it a great, good fortune, my dear sir, to be able to go in your vessel. When do you sail?" "Well, Miss Wallace, I have just signed the papers for a trip to the East Indies. I shall pail in about three weeks, and if you choose to go with me you shall have the best my ship affords." "Thank you, my fine friend," said Annie; "'I am sorry that you are not going sooner; but I shall- wait:and go in your ves- sel."7     164        ANNIE WALLACE. After a few moments' conversation the captain took his leave. When he had gone, Annie was informed of the arrangements that had been entered into by the viscount and Julia, and invited to be present upon the occasion. The remainder of the day Moray spent with the ladies; and on the following morning, the noble, quiet Lady Julia, ex-Abbess of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, became the wife of the handsome, generous Viscount Moray, in presence of Annie and two male friends of the viscount. Upon the following day they proceeded to London, to take up their abode in the town-house belonging to Moray. At Julia's urgent entreaty, to which was added a kind and cordial invita- tion from the viscount, Annie accompanied them, with the inten- tion of remaining until the "Grapeshot" should sail. Three weeks quickly passed, and the day arrived when Annie was to leave England alone, and make a weary voyage to the "distant isle." Annie rose early on the morning of the eventful day. During the morning meal, little was said-all were too much oppressed, in anticipation of the separation, to speak. Julia loved Annie as a younger sister, and Annie returned her affection as the one friend in whom she could trust. At eleven o'clock the carriage was at the door. It was a cold, gloomy, December morning, and as Annie stepped into the vehicle, a cold gust sent a chill through her frame. "The morning is dreary enough," remarked Annie. "Yes, but it may turn out pleasant yet before you leave," said Julia, now Countess Moray. "I hope so," replied Annie, and threw herself back, inclined to yield herself to gloomy reflections. Annie, accompanied by the Earl and Countess Moray (the viscount had become, by the sudden death of his father, Earl of Moray), arrived without accident, in Liverpool. A short drive brought them to the wharf, and, as they stepped upon the deck of the vessel, they were met and cordially wel- comed by Captain Sands. He bade them good-morning, and, turning to Annie, said: "Your tormentor was on board this morning; he came to   THE DEPARTURE FOR PENANG.     o   166 inquire when I intended to sail. By some necromancy, he has made himself acquainted with your movements." "Oh! I hope you did not tell him," said Annie, anxiously. "Do not fear him, my dear young lady," replied the captain. Unless he comes with some better sanction than his claim to relationship, he will not hurt you here. I did not, however, give him the informanton he sought." "How soon will you haul out in the stream?" inquired the earl. "In one hour, sir." "I suppose it is unnecessary to say one word for Miss Wal- lace's safety to you-the interest you seem to take in her will insure her protection." ' You may set your mind at rest concerning her," replied Cap- tain Sands. "My wife and daughter are with me on board, and  I hope Miss Wallace will find them sufficiently agreeable to make the time pass pleasantly." Moray and Julia remained on board until preparations were commenced for departure. Then came the parting scene. - Annie, with tearful eyes, reached out her arms for a last embrace, and these two noble women remained for a few moments clasped in a last affectionate embrace. The last kiss was given, a reluctant farewell exchanged, and they parted. Moray hastily bade Annie good-Ih and hurried away with Julia. Ten minutes later the noble ship moved from the wharf, never to touch another. It was evening before those on board lost sight of land. Annie had taken a last, lingering look: then Britain, with its few pleas- ant, and many bitter, associations, was mingled with the scenes ;I and recollections of the past. Annie walked from the side of the ship from which she had gazed upon the receding shores, and sat down upon a bench on the quarter-deck. It was cold and windy, but Annie was too deeply-absorbed in thought to heed the weather. She gazed at the moon and the heavy clouds as they came rolling up in black masses, ever and anon spreading themselves out over the face of the planet, and shutting out her silvery light; then again, as she would catch her X     166        ANNIE .WALLACE. bright, genial smile, shining out from a patch of clear sky, Annie would seem to pass from herself, and float upward towards that bright world. Hope-sweet, buoyant, often-dimmed, but never dying, fadeless hope-came strong within her. She was enabled to put her trust in God; faith as well as hope grew brighter, and the inspirations of His grace illumined her mind, and, by its gentle breathings, soothed and calmed her troubled soul; while in its mellowed light, bright scenes of hap- piness rose in the future. Yes, again anticipations, bright and cheerful, filled her bosom; and, with lighter step and brighter looks she sought her pillow. Hope had warmed the chilly air of the night, and shed its invigorating influence through her whole soul, and vanquished the crushing recollections of bitter- ness that had made her sad; and, with renewed faith and trust in Him who careth for the sparrow, Annie laid her down to sleep. Had Annie forgotten Henry Monteith? We shall see. We will leave her for a short time, and return and trace the steps of her brother Peter. K,   CHAP    ER XXV. C AGRIN. ABOUT ten o'clock on the evening of the same day the "Grapeshot" sailed, a man might have been seen, walking rapidly along the wharf to the place where she had lately been moored. He was followed by' two men carrying a trunk. Look- ing around, as he neared the place, he muttered: "All right-- the scamp did not deceive me after all;" and he boarded the vessel. "Where is your captain?" said he, to a man on watch. "Below deck, sir," replied the sailor. "I wish to see him." "You must go to his room, sir. I cannot leave; I am on watch-duty." The stranger called to the men who had his trunk in charge, and, giving them each a piece f silver, dismissed them, and pro- ceeded to the captain's room. As he moved along, casting his eyes about, he said to himself: "By Jove! they have been niaking alterations. I would hardly know the ship:" As he was descending the companion-way some one hailed him: "Holloa, there; who is coming?" "A passenger, sir," replied the stranger. "I think you have made a mistake, friend. I have just come in this afternoon, and have not had time to unload yet; and cer- tainly am not ready for passengers." Ha, ha!" laughed the stranger; "you are fibbing; I am not to be gulled."   '     168        ANNIE WALLACE. "Who the devil are you, sir?" exclaimed the individual, who now came forward. "How dare you call me a liar?" "Why no, Captain Sands, I do not call you a liar; at the same time, I certainly know that your ship has lain here three weeks." "Well, sir, I see, by your calling me Captain Sands, that you are under a mistake, or I would teach you better manners than calling me a liar on my own vessel!" A sudden thought seemed to strike the stranger, and he asked, quickly: "Is not this the 'Grapeshot,' commanded by Captain Sands T" "No, sir," replied the other; "this is the 'Charles Edward,' commanded by Captain Mason, my humble self." "Where, then, is Captain Sands' vessel?" asked Jamieson; for he it was, though so disguised that even Captain Sands might have been deceived. "Captain Sands," replied Captain Mason, "sailed this fore- noon, and is in pretty rough water by this time." Jamieson turned pale with rage and disappointment; he cursed the hypocrisy of the " damned Yankee captain, as he termed Captain Sands, and walked about the ship, giving vent to his anger in the use of language and expletives, disgusting, and alto- gether unsuited to a gentleman. Captain Mason reminded him that the hour was late, and intimated that his departure would be most agreeable. He left, saying that he would send for his baggage in the morning, and vowing vengeance towards all Yankee captains. The bird had flown; his Edinburgh residence was suddenly annihilated, and his imaginary squads of noble friends had all vanished. Again he was penniless and hopeless. Hope could find no anchorage in his unprincipled soul; and he drifted on to the cataract of despair. He had watched and fol- lowed Annie from the time she had first landed, and, by the most artful manoeuvres, had managed to discover her inten- tion to. sail with Captain Sands; when, by a bold stratagem, enacted at the last moment of sailing, he had intended to embark in the same vessel and "see it out, any way," as he   CHAGRIN.           169 expressed it in a letter to Mrs. Wallace, but which she had not received. Baffled in his efforts to follow Annie, he, the next morning, started for Edinburgh, at which place he arrived in due time, and repaired immediately to the house of his sister, Mrs. Wallace. It was near evening, when he rang th- bell and was admitted; he walked straight to the parlor, and, seeing that it was unoccu- pied, sent for his sister, who quickly joined him. "Why, Walter," said she, "I am glad to see you. When did you arrive?" "This moment," answered Walter, gloomily, not at all recipro- cating the lady's gladness and joy. "How is Annie: where did you leave her?" "I did not leave her at all, Jane. Shq left me," returned he. "Left you!-what do you mean, Walter?" quickly rejoined the lady. "I mean what I say, precisely. Did you not get letters from me?" "Not one since you left; and, as no news is good news, I supposed that everything was going on prosperously; but what has become of Annie 2" "She has sailed for the island of Penang." "Penang! Penang!  Good heavens! Walter, what do you mean," fairly screamed Mrs. Wallace, changing quickly from the calm, self-possessed, loving sister, to the reckless, passion-ruled woman; her eyes lighted up with wild fury, and her clenched hands thrown up, as she continued: "And how on earth did she escape you; you are a fool-a poor, weak fool-or this would not have happened." "Beware, sister! I will not endure this from you. I have already submitted to insult and contempt enough to merit the wealth of the three kingdoms." "Don't tell me to beware, Walter! You are an unprincipled, penniless beggar." "I have the least money, Jane, that's true; but may I perish if I have the least principle. Yes, my fair sister," said Walters 15     170        ANNIE WALLACE. raising his voice, and speaking with sudden energy, " you are the most avaricious, subtle, and, I will add, ungrateful female devil that ever breathed. The word principle is not in your vocabu- lary, and its essence in your bosom does not amount to a millionth part of a grain. It was you that led me on to do what I have done; it was you that held out to me the glittering prize. Yes, you tempted me; and now, when I have doubly damned myself to serve your purpose-because I, the agent of your vicious design, have been frustrated by virtue and innocence--you, Jane, the instigator and coadjutor of all that has been done, spurn me with taunts and reproaches." Mrs. Wallace listened to this unexpected tirade in silence. She had felt her brother to be so entirely dependent on her in pecuniary matters that she did not expect this independent out- break of feeling; but, recovering herself after a few moments, she laughed sneeringly, and replied: "We are an amiable family, truly, according to your portrait- ure; your sketches are complimentary, certainly; but, hark you, brother mine, you are a beggar-yea, a beggar. When you might have been possessed of wealth you faltered; now it has escaped your grasp." "And I am glad of it, Jane. I am a hardened sinner, swayed by passion and selfish motives; but, now that Annie's fortune is beyond my reach-now that I know it is hopeless, she cannot be mine-I am glad that she has escaped you-yes, sister, glad. I have no principle; but I have a little heart-where self comes not to'interfere." W "I suppose, then, it was your sympathetic heart that helped Annie to escape," said Mrs. Wallace. "You are mistaken," answered Walter. "If you had been less hasty in your accusations, I would have informed you before of the particulars of the whole affair." "Well, I am your patient listener." And Walter Jamieson gave a detailed account, of what had transpired since they parted. Mrs. Wallace listened attentively, and when he had finished, she said:   CHAGRIN.           171 "Well, I don't know; but it seems to me I would have man- aged matters better. But Annie's fortune shall be mine yet; it is mine by right.' I shall want your assistance--you can aid me if you will-you have courage-no principle, but a little heart," said she, sarcastically. "If you want me to serve you further, Jane, you must furnish me with money; for, as you have said, I am penniless," said Jamieson. Mrs. Wallace gave him what he required, and told him to return to London, and she would communicate with him at that place at the proper time. They parted-but this time no kiss was exchanged; and as Walter Jamieson walked to his hotel, a better spirit rose within him; many good thoughts and aspira- tions filled his mind, and it seemed as if heaven was holding out one more opportunity of escape from the thraldom of his iniquitous course. But the pleadings of the good Spirit were soon repressed and forgotten. That night, he entered a gam- bling-house-fortune favored him-he won rapidly and largely, and ceased not until daylight, when he left, promising to return next night to win more, or lose what he had. But Jamieson was too great a rogue to return to that saloon, and ere night he was on his way to London, comparatively rich. * .      CHAPTER XXVI. THE LOST SISTER. ABOUT a week subsequent to the scenes related in the last chapter, a carriage stopped one morning in front of the Wallace mansion. Two young men alighted, and, ascending the steps to the front door, rang the bell. In a few moments the door was opened, and, without announcing their names, or inquiring for any person, they entered. The parlor was occupied by Mrs. Wallace and her brother Robert, engaged in earnest conversa- tion. Upon the entrance of the young men, they both rose in surprise: Mrs. Wallace, for a moment, was at a loss to under- stand the intrusion; but the dark complexion and peculiar cast of features of one of the young men enabled her to recognize her late husband's son, although she had not seen him in four years. "Why, Peter!" exclaimed Mrs. Wallace, advancing quickly; "my dear boy, how do you do? when did you arrive?" "I have just arrived in Edinburgh, madam; but where is my sister Annie?" Mrs. Wallace dropped her eyes, and, raising her handkerchief to her face, pretended to be seriously affected. "Where is she?" repeated Peter, trembling with anxiety. "Have you not heard?" said Mrs. Wallace. "Heard what?" answered he. "Is my sister dead?" turning pale with emotion. "No," replied Mrs. Wallace; "Annie is not dead-but-but-" "But what?" shouted Peter; " speak, woman-what mean you ." "She has fled with some young man, and gone I know not whither."   THE LOST SISTER.          173 "Great God! she is ruined!" exclaimed he, as he staggered back to the sofa. His companion-who was none other than Philip Marcella- stepped towards him, fearing that he had fainted; but no-Peter had only closed his eyes in agony at the cruel falsehood that had. been told him. Presently he recovered himself sufficiently, and resumed his inquiries. "Where did Annie go, madam, and with whom?" "I know as little about the affair as yourself. I can only tell you that she left my house, and I have not seen her since." The young man pressed his brow in agony; but tears streamed through his fingers as he mur-mured: "I have gained one sister, but to lose another." Mrs. Wallace pretended to comfort Peter, and, with seeming concern, besought him to look at the bright side of the picture. "Annie's husband may be a very worthy young man. I never saw him-but -" '"Is she married?" asked Peter, eagerly. "So report says," replied Mrs. Wallace. "You might have told this at first," said he, and, rising, he took his leave, notwithstanding Mrs. Wallace urged him to remain. As they left the house, Philip remarked: "Your step-mother is a splendid-looking woman, Peter." "Ah, Philip, I am thinking little of looks, now; poor Annie is uppermost in my mind." "Well, Peter, handsome as she is, I would not trust altogether tot her tales: I doubt if they are true, if you have represented your sister rightly." "I have, Philip, and I tell you," said Peter, "if Annie has done' this thing, she has been driven to it by the harshness of Mrs. Wallace; and, if it be so, I will "spend my fortune but I will have satisfaction. I am not a revengeful disposition; but I could not forgive her; and," said Peter, "4 if she has fallen by the wiles of the seducer, blood alone can wipe out the stain."  And a wild gleam shot from his eyes. "You are wrong, Peter; blood could not wash out such a !       t74        ANNIE WALLACE. rtain, and the gnawings of remorse would be a greater punish- ment." "Ha, Philip, his remorse, then, must be experienced in a moment's time; for, until I drink his blood, my bosom will be a hell." O, do not talk so, Peter," said Philip; " you are excited." "And shall be more so each breath I draw. O, the goading thought that my own sister should be the victim of man's treach- ery! Hell, with all its torments, is not equal to this stinging thought; it is agony beyond description!" exclaimed the young man, as he strode on, faster and faster. "But listen to reason, Peter. No such thing was stated to you; it is a phantom you have conjured up yourself. I do not see-" "Philip, she did not tell me so in words, but her countenance and manner signified more than her words; she has made me wretched," said the unhappy young man. "If I only knew where to seek my sister-" "But, where are we going now, Peter? This road seems to be leading us from the city. Let us seek our hotel." Peter stopped, and, casting his eyes about him, said: "We are going wrong;" and they turned to retrace their steps. After walking on silently a short distance, Peter stopped suddenly; and, saying, "I will call and see him," rushed across the street. He had espied Mr. Montgomery's house, and, recol- lecting that he had been his father's lawyer (although the busi- ness had been transferred to other hands since the death of Captain Wallace), supposed that, possibly, he might gain some information. Philip followed his nephew, wondering at his strange behavior; he saw Peter ascend the steps leading to a room above, and the next moment heard him inquire if "Mr. Montgomery was in?" "That is my name, sir," replied an elderly gentleman, coming forward from the back part of the office. Peter stepped forward, and announced himself as the son of the late Captain Wallace. A warm greeting followed this an-     nouncement, and Peter presented Philip to Mr. Montgomery as his new-found relative.  "And have you seen Mrs. Wallace since your return," in- quired the kind old gentleman. "I have," said Peter; "and the evil news I have heard has led me to seek advice and information, if in your power to give it, from you." "Then you have heard of your step-mother's tyranny, and, that she has immured Annie in the convent of the Sacred Heart?" "I have heard quite a different story, sir," replied Peter, amazed at what he heard.     . "And what have you heard?" asked Mr. Montgomery. "That Annie has left Mrs. Wallace's roof with a young gen- tleman whom she never saw, and knows nothing of," said Peter. "It is false," replied the other. "Mrs. Wallace has placed her in a convent, upon the pretense of completig her education; but strong suspicions are afloat, that your sister is not at liberty to leave it, and that strong efforts are being made to induce her to take the veil." ' Are you assured of the truth of this statement, my good friend?" asked Peter. "'Perfectly assured, in my own mind, of the entire truth of every word I have told you; it is for you to search out the proof: that I cannot give you. This I do know, and can prove, that Mrs. Wallace is, by every means in her power, seeking to defraud you of your wealth." '- Her worst fraud is her treatment of my sister, who, by fair or foul means, I shall liberate first, and then I will require your assistance to deal with Mrs. Wallace," replied Peter.    "I suppose, ny young friend," said Mr. Montgomery, " that you have seen acopy of your father's will ," "I have, sir"i red Peter. "Well, sir, ccdng to that will, yon are not to coite into possession of Eat property until the death of Mrs. Wallace." "I am aware that such is the case," answered Peter.    176.        ANNIE WALLACE. "But you are not aware, neither is Mrs. Wallace, that there is a codicil to the will providing that, if Mrs. Wallace does not deal justly and kindly with you and your sister, you are to come into possession of the property when Annie reaches the age of twenty- five ;- but, you will have to prove, first, that such is the case, and get a verdict against her for dishonest administration." "This is all new to me, of course," said' Peter;' "but first I must get Annie under my protection. I will see you again in the morning, Mr. Montgomery. You have removed a crushing weight from my bosom," continued he, "and, after some repose, I shall be ready for active exertion in these matters." Peter left much calmer and more hopeful. They proceeded to a hotel, and made themselves comfortable for the remainder of the day. After leaving Penang, the ship, in which Peter Wallace and Philip Marcella sailed, for about twelve days had good weather, and bade fair to make a quick voyage; had it so happened, Peter would have arrived in England before Annie embarked for Penang. But it was otherwise decreed. About noon, on their twelfth day out, they were overtaken by a fierce tempest, and forced to return to Penang, where they remained six weeks. Peter was impatient, and determined to take passage in the first vessel bound for home. But none came, and he was com- pelled to wait until the vessel in which he first sailed should be overhauled. At last they got under way the second time. The weather was unfavorable for a quick passage, and Peter arrived  i in Liverpool the same day that Annie sailed for Penang. He .. remained that night in the same hotel where Annie had stopped the previous night, and the next morning started for Edinburgh, accompanied by Madame Corrilla and her daughter Emily--a lively friendship having sprung up between them which the con- stant intercourse, consequent upon a long sea voyage, was likely to terminate in a warmer sentiment with regard to Peter and Emily Corrilla. After leaving them in London, Peter proceeded :-   THE INTERVIEW.          1" -to Edinburgh, accompanied by Philip, and presented himself to his step-mother, when the scenes, as related above, transpired. /CHAPTER     XXVII. THE INTERVIEW. THE next morning Peter called, according to appointment, on Mr. Montgomery. The worthy old gentleman received him very cordially, and, during their conference, which lasted several hours, informed him of many circumstances of which he had been previously ignorant. After leaving Mr. Montgomery, he returned to the hotel, and made Philip acquainted with the facts which had been related to him. Philip counseled him to see Mrs. Wallace again, before leaving Edinburgh; and, after some reflection, he decided upon that course. Later in the day, Peter turned his steps towards the dwelling of his step-mother, which he soon reached, the distance being short. As he ascended the Steps, and was awaiting the servant to answer his ring, his hearywas filled with bitter thoughts of the unprincipled avarice of te woman his father had cherished in his bosom, and left guard'n to his children and their property, with such trustful confi dnce, and the heartless cruelty exercised towards his young and unprotected sister, and feelings of deep hatred took possession of him. "I am not bound to forgive her unless she repent of her wickedness," muttered he, " and repent she never will." Mrs. Wallace was sitting alone in the drawing-room, when Peter was announced. She arose, and greeted him with great cordiality; nay, her manner was even affectionate. She was playing for a high stake; she had involved herself so deeply it was impossible to retract, without exposing the full extent of her s?'*     178        ANNIE WALLACE. iniquity, and thus she was compelled to go on, adding to the de- ceptions she had already practiced. "I am glad to see you, my son," said she. Peter bowed coldly, in answer to her salutation. "Have you been successful in learning anything of Annie?" inquired the lady. "I have, madam," replied Peter, casting a look of calm con- tempt upon her. Mrs. Wallace evidently became slightly agitated.  "What have you heard?" she inquired. '"The truth," replied Peter. "And what is the truth--why do you not tell me?" con- tinued she. "Because it is not necessary to repeat a tale with which you are already familiar." Mrs. Wallace trembled. Annie was a defenseless girl, whom she could threaten and deceive; but her brother was a determined man, and well she knew his daring, impetuous disposition, if once aroused, and that it would require all her art and ingenuity to save herself, if he had obtained any clue to the real state of the case. ' Mrs. Wallace had felt safe in telling Peter her own story in regard to Annie's absence, as she thought no one in Edinburgh was aware of her wicked plot. She had always accounted for her disappearance by relating the same story with which she had deceived Peter. Rumor, with her hundred tongues, spread the story abroad, with numerous additions, and she had felt at rest in her wickedness. Yet still she trusted, by a bold effort, to extricate herself. Annie and Monteith were both upon the treacherous sea, and she determined to maintain her innocence. Having taken this resolution, she answered the young man in accordance with it. "My dear Peter, I am at a loss to understand you." "It is useless, madam," replied Peter, "to attempt keeping np this farce any longer: your wicked deceptions are all ex- posed." "Peter, your language is insulting; you forget that I was   AitH t N gJltlfiKY JUW. 1NXVay your father's wife," answered the lady, her temper getting the better of her prudence. b                 v "I remember that you are his children's curse." "Peter," said Mrs. Wallace, striving to repress her rising pas- sion, "you are too harsh; I see that you are laboring under great excitement;. you have been deceived by the false rumors that are afloat, and, without seeking out the trpth, ypou have come here to accuse me." "You are right, madam, with regard to the object of my visit." "But, if you do not explain yourself, I shall leave you; tell me, at least, of what you suppose me guilty." "That is told in few words: You sent my sister to a con- vent in Italy on pretense of completing her education; but, in reality, she is a prisoner. This, madam, is one of your damnable attempts to sacrifice my sister at the shrine of mammon." Mrs. Wallace was relieved; she drew her breath freely again; here was the extent of his knowledge; he did not know, then, of her plans with regard to Walter; he did not know that she had escaped. She resolved to persist in her innocence, and she laid her plans accordingly. "Pete, you have received false information. Whoever told you this, has wished to cause you sorrow." "Your own tales have caused me the most sorrow." "You saw with what pain I disclosed the truth to you; un- feeling boy! you know not the bitterness Annie's behavior has caused me," said this hypocritical step-mother. But Peter was not to be deceived, and he answered: "And you, wicked woman that you are, witnessed my woe- the annihilation of all my hopes-and yet you persisted, and still persist, in your falsehoods, and try to sacrifice my sister's fair name; but, thank heaven, I have discovered the truth, and will rescue my sister. I only wait your signature to this check on my banker." "I shall not sign it," replied she, now thoroughly exasperated. "You have abused and insulted me! I will not do you this favor."                         ....     180        ANNIE WALLACE. "By Jove, madam," said Peter, i' the coolness of that speech surpasses everything else. Then you think you would be doing me a favor, by allowing me my own?" "It is not your own, sir," replied Mrs. Wallace. "Well, madam, it is useless for us to hold any further con- versation with each other. Fortunately, I shall be able to get sufficient money to go to Italy, for the purpose of liberating my sister; and, when I return, I will investigate and hold you accountable for the many frauds and forgeries you have practiced on mine and my sister's bankers--such as signing my name to checks, when I was at sea; and my sister's, when she was in Italy." "My God! Peter, of what do you accuse me!" exclaimed Mrs. Wallace.                   . "Of robbery," Peter replied. ' Rash boy, beware what you do!" "Take the same warning to yourself, madam." "I will sign that check, Peter, on condition that you will inform me whence you derive all this information." " Oh, never mind; I am not pressed for money now, and you will learn, soon enough, the source of my information. Good- day, madam." "Stay, Peter!" cried Mrs. Wallace, as he rose to go. "No, I cannot stay. To-night or to-morrow morning I intend starting for Italy." "But you must stay, Peter." "I will not," he answered, and hurried from the house. When he had gone, Mrs. Wallace returned to her room, where her bright, fair-haired boy was playing on the floor. She cast one look of selfish love towards him, and threw herself on the bed, as she murmured: s' I must act, or I am undone. Oh, my precious, precious darling! I will not lose thy fortune. It is yours by right and possession"--and the wicked, ambitious mother sobbed with disappointment. When Peter again reached his hotel, he found Philip anxiously awaiting his return.   THE INTERVIEW.         181 "Halloa!" cried he, as Peter entered the room: " where have you been so long?" "To pass an hour with my splendid step-mother," replied Pe- ter. "But come, Philip," he continued, cc strap up your trunks; we must be off to Italy." "When do we start?" inquired Philip. ' To-night; we cannot wait longer. But, by-the-by, you must draw a check for money sufficient to defray the expenses of both. That old hypocrite would not sign a check for me." "What did she say when you told her about Annie?" "She attempted to deny it, and convince me that I had been deceived by false reports ; but I happened to know her of old. I would not have trusted you, though, Philip; for that woman, in manner, can become one of the most affectionate, loving crea- tures I ever saw." "And if she had not been a step-mother," said Philip, " she might have been an honest, sincere woman, perhaps." "You would have to wag your sage tongue a long time to convince me of that, Philip." "You are prejudiced." "No, I am not prejudiced; but it is impossible for a woman with her devilish disposition to be sincere." "Did you ever love Mrs. Wallace?" inquired Philip. "No," responded Peter, energetically; "I hated her from the first moment she came under our roof." "And you took no trouble to conceal your dislike from her." "No, I cannot say that I did." "Well, then, you hated her from the first because she was not your own, but your step-mother. You concluded that she was possessed of a bad disposition before you knew whether this was the truth or not. You were governed by prejudice, and, when she came into your house, you betrayed your dislike. And she, also, was naturally prejudiced. Your treatment increased her prejudice to hatred; but, had. you both acted affectionately, you would have cultivated the nobler traits in each other's dis- position." 16     182        ANNIE WALLACE. "You argue well, Philip but you are in error. She was never possessed of a good disposition. She cares not for our love. She wants our money for her own boy." "Certainly; since you would not allow her to love you, her love -has all centred in her own boy. He was as much the son of Captain Wallace as yourself, and, no doubt, she thinks she is simply using her influence to gain all for his youngest child." "Well, Philip, I am rather surprised to find you trying to justify so heartless, so hardened a woman." "She may be hardened, Peter, and heartless ; but, possibly, under'different circumstances, she may have had better impulses. You know the noblest can be seduced by circumstances. If her mind had been properly trained, and the affections of her heart properly cultivated, she would not have yielded to temptation; but human nature, unsustained by Christian principles can be won to anything. Remember, human nature is weak, and easily falis to the left; and even principle itself can be undermined by temptation and circumstances, and destroyed." "Philip, you argue with a Cicero's diction; but you lack his good sense." aWell, Peter, I was a fool to attempt to combat your preju- dices," said Philip, laughingly; "' but you will learn that the human heart is a great wonder, if you live many years." "' Possibly I will; but I doubt whether I shall ever be con- vinced that Mrs. Wallace could ever have been a woman of kindly feelings, or good principle." That evening Peter started for England, with the intention of proceeding to Italy as rapidly as possible.   CHAPTER    XXVIII. THE SEARCH. OUR patient or impatient reader, we would invite you once again to accompany us to Genoa. It was a cold, blustering day in January, when two young men might have been seen walking along the principal street towards the western exit from the city. They were muffled in heavy cloaks, and proceeded rapidly along, seemingly intent upon some important transaction, and regard- less of anything that was passing around them. They were our two friends, Peter Wallace and Philip Marcella. "It's a cold day, Peter," observed Philip. Peter responded very heartily in the affirmative. As the young men left the city by the western gate, and proceeded along the road towards the convent, they were met by a wintry blast from the Mediterranean. "By Jupiter, Philip, this cold wind does not corroborate all we have heard of Italia's ' balmy air. " "This is the dead of winter, and an unusual season I appre- hend," said Philip. "The deadening of wint rather, for my fingers are numb as a frozen stick holding on to this ponderous cloak." "Mine are ditto" answered Philip. "But do you -think we shall obtain entrance into the convent to-night?" "Ay, to-night or to-morrow we must gain admittance, by fair means or foul," said Peter. "We will try stratagem first."   i "And bribery," added Peter. "These Italians like the glitter of English sovereigns." By this time they had arrived opposite the convent.     184         ANNIE WALLACE. "This must be our place of destination," said Peter. "I think you are right; but let us inquire," said Philip, as he stepped up to the gate and rapped loudly. Presently a lattice opened, and an old man advanced his head and shoulders forth, and inquired: "Who is there?" "Friends, my good fellow," answered Philip, in italian. "We have no friends here, signore, except those whose signal- rap gains them admittance," the old man answered. "Well, first tell us if we are seeking admission in the right place. Is this the convent of the Sacred Heart?" "I Si, signore." Philip slipped a piece of gold into the old man's hand, and said, "Come, friend, won't such a rap as that gain us an admit- tance?" "I would like to oblige you, signore, but my life would pay the forfeit. If you will risk my neck for this I will admit you." "We do not want to buy your death-warrant for an English sovereign; at the same time, we would like to pass the gate," said Philip. "Would I not be able to do your wishes for you?" inquired I the porter. "No, no," replied Philip, " we must be admitted ourselves to the presence of the holy father, or it is of no use." "T Well, signore, one English sovereign is a small sum for a man to risk his neck; but a number of them might make it an object." "' Ah-I see," responded Philip; "here are ten of the same kind. Can we pass, now?" "Si, signore," replied the greedy Italian, grinning with satis- faction, and he withdrew his head; in a few moments, he reap- peared, with a rope-ladder in his hand. "Take this, signore," said he, "and go round to the south wall; there, with the assistance of this ladder, you can safely climb over the wall into the garden." "All right, old fellow; but how are we to get into the convent?"   THE SEARCH.    ,      185 "Oh, you want to go into the convent, do you? Well, after you have scaled the walls, you must follow the broadest path you find until you come to a place where three branch off in different directions; take the one on the right, follow it straight ahead, and it will lead you to a small door, where I will meet you, and show you how to open it." "Now we have a chance," said Philip, turning to Peter, who understood very little of the language in which the colloquy had been carried on. But Philip explained to him the substance of it, when Peter said: "I hope this old fellow will not prove treacherous." "I think not," returned Philip; " but for that we must be pre- pared."          - "You must be careful, signore, and -be sure, before you come to the little door, that none of the ladies are walking in the gar- den." "Trust us," replied Philip, and they walked around towards the south side- of the convent. They found it an easy matter to enter the garden, by means of the rope-ladder; and they soon found the path designated, and, by following it, they came ,to the place where three paths, diverged towards different parts of the gloomy building. A few minutes' walk brought them to the little door described by the porter. He was not there; and, after waiting awhile, they be- gan to grow impatient, when, suddenly, the little door flew open, and the porter appeared from the- inside. "I see you are here, signore." "On the spot," answered Philip; " but are we to have the benefit of your guidance, or must we blunder on alone?" "You will have to do the latter, signore; I tremble already for what I have done." "Well, show us how to open this door, so as to prevent any accident when we wish to make our exit." The porter soon taught them how to touch the spring; he then passed out into the garden, and hurried back to the lodge as rapidly as possible, while Philip and Peter walked boldly     186        ANNIE WALLACE. along the damp, narrow passage previously described in one of our former chapters as having afforded Moray and Monteith an entrance into the convent. Philip and his companions proceeded as far as the chapel with- out meeting any one, when they were suddenly startled by a  male voice, which sounded as if coming from before the altar.  The young men came to a sudden halt-hardly decided what to  do. They remained hidden in the passage for a few moments, when Peter whispere'd: ' We must do something; there's no use in stopping two or three hours in this place."  "You tremble, Peter, said Philip; be calm, I beseech you." "That I can't help; I am anxious and excited. But we might as well put a bold face on the matter, and demand the liberation of Annie." "Very well. I will first step forward, and disturb the devo- tions of this holy padre ;" and, taking a pistol from his bosom, Philip advanced alone. "Thy pardon, holy padre, for disturbing you," said he. The priest turned round in surprise. He trembled with affright upon beholding an armed stranger within the very chapel. "What brings thee here, stranger?" inquired the frightened priest. "I came for confessional purposes, holy padre," replied Philip, devoutly. "Thy appearance is singular for a man seeking to lay open his heart to God. I hope thou art not stained with blood." "I have not commenced my confessions yet, priest, and I don't know as I will make any confession myself, at all." "What doest thou here, then, where none but those of the Church are admitted?" "I come to demand a confession, padre," said Philip, holding his pistol in a position that made it visible to the trembling priest. ' What is thy will 9? I want Miss Annie Wallace deliveredinto my hands."   THE SEARCH.          187 "Miss Annie Wallace is not within these walls, signore." "Now I know thou liest, priest." "I am telling the truth; and had your ears been open to the  many reports flying about the city, you would have been ap- prised of her flight, ere this." "Is this a trick, priest, to gain time to remove her to some more secret dungeon?" "By the holy cross of Jesus, I swear, signore, that I am tell- ing thee the truth." "Then where has she fled to?" inquired Philip. "I know not, signore." "WThere can I ascertain her whereabouts?" "Padre Outran can tell thee much." "How can we see this same Padre Outran?" C Can I trust thee alone here, signore, while I tell him of thy presence?" You can," replied Philip; and the priest left them atone. "Suppose this be but a trick, to gain assistance, and surprise us, Philip?" said Peter, who had been an excited listener to all that had passed-a part of which only he understood. "I hardly think he intends to deceive us; but, if he should, we are safe enough. It will be an easy matter to gain the outer wall through that passage, should we see fit to fly."f "Oh, I am not thinking of escaping," said Peter. - I will not leave this convent, if Annie is within it,. until she be rescued, though fifty thousand padres attempt to detain her." The priest, when he left the young men, hurried along various passages, until he reached the door of the room in which was lying the wounded padre, who was slowly recovering from his injuries. He rapped, and a faint voice bade him enter. The priest opened the door, and, walking stealthily across the ante- ' room, entered the room where Padre Outran reclined upon a bed, supported by pillows. At' the foot of the bed stood a female, who dropped her veil as the priest entered. Padre Outran, raising his eyes, inquired: ' What is it, father?"     188        ANNIE WALLACE. The individual addressed stepped up to the bed, and whis- pered a few words in the ear of the sick Jesuit. "Show them in, without announcing their names," answered he in a whisper. "I will do thy bidding, holy padre ;" and he returned to the chapel, where he had left Philip and Peter. As the door closed behind the retiring priest, Padre Outran turned to the lady, and said: "Thy brother, madame, deceived me shamefully; and I can- not assist you in future, unless paid well enough to make amends for his mean deception." "But, padre," replied the lady, '"I have offered you a check; circumstances render it impossible that I could pay out such a large sum at present." "Well," answered he, "I will take nothing but the money. Promise me the money, and I will wait a stipulated time for the payment, before I make an exposure." "But I have told you, padre, that I could not advance the money now," reiterated the lady, exhibiting considerable excite- ment. a' Then I must sell my information to these young men." "They cannot give you the enormous sum you require, nor as much as I will give eventually." "But a bird in hand is worth two in the bush; and I must have the money, or they must have the information they seek." At that moment, steps were heard approaching. "Speak quickly, madame," said the wily priest; " they are coming." "Great God! what do you mean? who are coming?" ex- claimed the lady, trembling violently. "Annie's brother," replied the priest; " say, quickly, will you answer my demand?" "Oh, what shall I do! they must not see me!" said the lady. "But they must, unless you promise." Mrs. mV allace-for she it was-attempted to reply: "I prom--"   THE SEARCH.          1 89 passed her lips; but, before the sentence could be finished, the door opened, and Philip Marcella entered the room. "Too late," whispered the priest; 1" they must see you; keep down your veil, and, as soon as they are seated, rise to go." Then, turning to Philip, who approached the bed at that mo- ment, he said: "I greet thee, young signore." Philip returned his salutation, when the priest continued: "What is thy will--ow can I se ve thee?" At that moment the lady rose to go; and, turning to her, Padre Outran said: "I will listen to thy confessions, signora, another time; but, trouble not thyself-thy sins are not so great as thou thinkest." Peter, who had remained in the outer room, had not -observed that a female was present; but, on hearing the padre's words, he looked through the open door, and recognized his step-mother at once, by her form and manner. As the priest finished speaking, Peter said, in English-the language the padre had used in addressing Mrs. Wallace--"Don't allow us to disturb you, my amiable mother; we will wait until you have finished your hum- ble confessions." Mrs.- Wallace raised her veil at these words. She saw it was useless to attempt concealment; her face was pale with appre- hension ; fear and mortification were depicted upon every feature; again was she baffled; striving to hide her emotion, and assume an air of injured feeling, she turned to Peter, and said: "You have wronged me, Peter, and abused me; still, my affection for you and your sister continues unchanged, for my husband's sake; and anxiety for Annie prompted this journey to Italy. From the tenor of the information you gave me, I expected to find Annie here;, but, great is my grief to find that those who brought her here have removed her." "Madam," replied Peter, "I have no doubt that your affeo- tion is unchanged, and that you love both of us as you love the serpent." "Oh! what misery, to be thus misunderstood! I[ did, not ,     190         AN3Em WALLACE. love you, Peter, why am I in Italy?' said the hypocritical woman, affecting to sob. "You are here, probably," said Peter, " to suit your own pur- poses; but your trick is too shallow, madam. If I had antici- pated meeting you here, I should have imagined just this scene and story. But no, my fair mother," added he, in an ironical tone, "I have not lived my few years for nothing: your coming here, only confirms the account I heard in Edinburgh." "Peter, if you cannot believe my word, you will not doubt this holy man. Question him--satisfy yourself. He dare not lie." "If he be your friend, I would not believe his word, were he even the pope himself." "But he is your friend, as much as mine. Ask him-perhaps you may be satisfied." Peter turned to the priest, and said: "What say you, padre? You have heard what has been said. Was my sister confined here; and, if so, by whom?" "I can say, signore, that such ao lady was here-sent by whom, it remains to be discovered," answered the wily priest. "Now, Peter, are you convinced that I am innocent?" "No," said Peter, coolly, "I am not." "Rash, obstinate boy-my heart is broken. You will kill me by such treatment. You, for whom I would do anything, wound me the deepest." And the guilty woman wrung her hands in anguish and fear. "Go, madame," interposed the priest; " thou art to6 much excited, and this young man is angered against thee; but when he shall discover his error, he will seek thy forgiveness, and, no doubt, prove a dutiful and affectionate son." As the priest ceased speaking, Mrs. Wallace approached her husband's son, and, with expressions of the tenderest affection, entreated his confidence and affection--nay, so truly were these feelings counterfeited, that Philip, who had been a silent specta- tor of the scene, was half-deceived. Not so Peter, who drew back as she offered her hand.   THE SEARCH.           191 "No, madam," said he; " your offers of kindness are like the kiss of Judas; ay, the betrayal of what is dearer than life. Restore to me my sister, anid I may listen to you." ' I cannot do that, Peter; but I forgive you all your bitter taunts, and will pray heaven to forgive you, also." So saying, Mrs. Wallace left the room. Mrs. Wallace had started for England the morning after Peter's departure for the same place. It was her earnest desire and in- tention to arrive in Italy first. By a fortunate chance, she got one day's travel ahead of them, and succeeded in reaching her place of destination twenty-four hours in advance. Since her arrival, she had seen Padre Outran twice, and had used every endeavor, and called into practice all her'art, to induce him to bind himself to swear that Annie Wallace was placed in the con- vent by an individual who represented himself to be her father, and that she was confined in accordance with his special order. The priest, who had been cheated by her brother, refused to do so, unless she gave him a large sum of money first. Dur- ing this second interview, and before they had completed their arrangements, they were interrupted, as related, by Peter and Philip. Mrs. Wallace, never at a loss for a lie, tried to palm off on Peter the story she told him. But Peter was not to be deceived; and he felt convinced now, beyond doubt, that Annie had been confined in the convent by Mrs. Wallace; and he hated her bitterly. rb      -   -fl     f * CHAPTER XXIX. THE UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH--THE MURDEROUS RESOLUTION. As Mrs. Wallace left the room, Philip turned to Padre Outran, and said: "Can you give us any correct information in regard to the whereabouts of Annie Wallace?" "First, signore," replied the priest, "I would like to inquire how you gained admission into the convent?" "We scaled the garden-wall, and discovered the spring that opens the door that leads into the chapel, by watching a nun who preceded us, though she was not aware of our presence." "That door shall be closed, so as to prevent any future intru- sions." "If we were on different business, padre, we might apologize for our intrusion; but the liberty of my friend's sister is too important a matter to admit of -ceremonious delay; and if you have had anything to do with her inveiglement into this place, it behooves you to aid us in our search." "I cannot aid you unless I am furnished with money to buy the information from others. I am ignorant, myself, concerning her." "If money will buy your/ information, padre, you shall have all you require." "Give me one thousand pounds sterling, signore, and I will direct you to a person who will give you all the information you desire." i' A thousand pounds is a large sum, padre, to pay for that which you have no right to withhold." *                     t   UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH-MURDEROUS RESOLUTION. 193 "But I shall withhold it, signore, unless the moneypbe paid." "Will you?". said Peter, suddenly becoming greatly enraged. ( I will," replied the priest. "Then I will choke the truth out of you!" exclaimed Peter; and he stepped towards the bed, with the intention of putting his threat into execution. Philip seized him by the arm, and said: "Hold! Peter! do-nothing rash." Peter abstained from attempting anything further, though the wild brilliancy of his eyes betrayed the fierce passion burning within him. Padre Outran, seeing what determined characters he had to deal with, was a little more respectful in his demeanor. "I have done nothing to provoke you, signore," he said, "but I am fevered now, and cannot talk with you; I will see you both again," and taking a small crucifix from his bosom, he handed it to Philip, and said: "Come here to-morrow at this same hour, signore; that image will gain you an entrance." "I will come to-morrow," said Philip. The priest rang a bell, which was answered by Father John. "Show these gentlemen out," said Padre Outran, in English. The priest bade them follow him, and, after passing through a circuitous passage, they arrived at the porter's lodge, who opened the gate and allowed them to pass out. When the young men got without the gates of the convent, they found the air balmy as June. The wind, that had blown so strong in the afternoon, was hushed and still; it had been one of those sudden blasts that sweep from the mountain-side some- times; but now not a zephyr stirred the air. It was a beautiful , starry night; the calm waters of the Mediterranean were visible on one side, and on the other rose the towering Alps, while before them they could see the lights of the distant city. "Well, Philip," said Peter, "I feel much better-I think we shall discover my poor sister soon. Oh, how I would enjoy this walk if she were only with me! It is many years since I have     194        ANNIE WALLACE. seen Annie. When I left Scotland, she was a little dark-eyed girl, with not only good features, but elegant eyes." "If I did not know what you suffered within, Peter, I would say that you took her wrongs quite philosophically." '"I do not, though, Philip." "I know that; still it seems to me that I should feel like raving all the time; and, though I have been finding fault with you, yet I do not believe I would have acted with half the sense that you have." "Oh, now, don't flatter," said Peter, laughingly affecting a lady's demure way of saying so. "I don't think you will stand flattery, Peter-you have con- siderable vanity already. But, by Jove, if I had not chanced to have been there, I don't know what you would have done to the poor priest." "4 I would have choked him." "Well, I am glad that you did not; and I am really sorry to hear you talk so recklessly about shedding human blood." "Oh, I don't mean half what I say, Philip ;- but then I have been so used to talking that way on board ship-there everything is shoot, shoot." "When you are on board of your ship it may sound well enough; but it don't ashore." By this time they reached the city, and found the gates closed. "There," said Peter, stopping short, " we are locked out." "That is an oversight, and it will not be so pleasant to camp out here." "We must gain admittance someway, so let us try it;" and Peter commenced thundering against the gate. Presently the keeper shouted from within: "Halloa, there! who's without the gates this time of night?" "Strangers," said Philip; "and we will give an English sovereign to be admitted." The sovereign was an object: the gate was speedily opened, and they soon reached their hotel. That night, just as they had   UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH-----MURDEROUS RESOLUTION. 195 finished their supper, which they had ordered in their room, there was a knock at the door. "Come in," said Peter, and Robert Jamieson entered the room.  "Good-evening, Peter," said he. "Good-night, professor," replied Peter, who was slightly affect- ed with wine. t"You will be the death of Mrs. Wallace, Peter, if you continue to treat her as you have done." ' She is too wicked to die so easily, professor." "Come, Peter, you must cease talking in that way about your father's widow and my sister.' "Why, I see my father's ghost grinning encouragement now," said Peter, irreverently. "I come with a proposition to you, Peter; if ypu will cease your trivial conduct, I will state it to you." "Go ahead, professor." "Well, your kind mother--- ' "My kind," interrupted Peter. "You must not interrupt me," continued the professor "until you hear me out. As I said before, your kind mother----" "My kind mother," again interrupted Peter. The professor stopped. "Proceed, sir; go on," said Peter. "Why, then, did you interrupt me?" "Simply because I cannot refrain from saying amen to your ' kind mother.'" "Well, then, Mrs. Wallace, your father's wife, proposes to give you one-quarter of the estates coming to you, into your own hands, provided you will leave Scotland for one year." "I will not," said Peter. "She will give you one-third." "I would not leave Scotland now if she would give me my whole fortune, with twenty others just like it." "I can do no more, then," said Robert Jamieson; and he left the room.                 ' p     L96        ANNIE WALLACE. "What impudence that woman has," said Philip, after Jamieson had retired. "Impudence! why, she is the most artful woman I ever met, or expect to meet with, on earth." The next morning, the younn men arose early, and, after breakfasting, went out for a stroll. On their return, as they were about to enter the hotel, Peter recognized his artful step-mother at one of the upper windows. "There is my evil genius," said he; and, turning to go into the house, he brushed heavily against a young gentleman who was passing out. "Excuse me, sir," said Peter. "'It is I that should ask pardon," replied the stranger, in English. Peter bowed and passed on. He had not been in his room many minutes, ere a message came from Mrs. Wallace, desiring to see him. He hesitated for some time before he could decide whether it would be the best plan to see her again, at present; but, at last, he concluded to go to her, and proceeded to her room forthwith. Mrs. Wallace, apparently, had been weeping: as he entered, she arose and said: "Take a seat, my son." Pray, do not 'my son' me," said Peter, with a sailor's blunt- ness. ' It is my privilege," replied Mrs. Wallace, "and I do not see why I should not." "'Well, well, madam, do as you please; but inform me, as speedily as possible, why you sent for me " "Yoar Uncle Robert has obtained some clue to the place of Annie's retreat, and he wishes you to accompany him to a convent some miles from here, to ascertain if she be really there." "I will not go; I believe it to be merely a trick to divert my attention, and occupy my time, while you take measures to secure her beyond my reach," said Peter. "O Peter, Peter! has it come to this ."   UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH-MURDEROUS RESOLUTION. 197 "It has come to this; and, if this be all you have to say, I will bid you good-morning;" and Peter rose to go. Mrs. Wallace urged him to stay and listen to-her. He refused, and the lady, in a sudden burst of passion, exclaimed, as he left her: "Go, then, to your ruin." The moment the door closed, her countenance changed to an expression of fury; and, clenching her hands, and looking wildly about, she muttered: "There is, then, no alternative--o other way to get rid of him. I am foiled, disgraced, ruined, unless he be removed. Yes, rash boy, it has come to this-to this ;" and a shudder passed over her frame. It has come to this," she repeated, and she pressed her hands upon her throbbing temples, and paced rapidly back and forth. "Yea, Peter, I can stand it no longer. You have outraged my feelings; taunted, scorned, and insulted me; laughed 'at, and ridiculed me," said she, bitterly; " but I'll meet thee," she con- tinued. "You have brought it on yourself; you have made it necessary for me to be a-" here she stopped; and, again speak- ing in low, muttered tones; "but I will do it, obstinate boy; you shall die by the assassin's blade. I will not bear thy taunts, and lose my estate. You shall die!" and she sank back in a chair, pale and exhausted with the violence of passion. Mrs. Wallace remained an hour absorbed in her plans and thoughts of evil; at the end of that time, she rose, and, ordering a carriage, proceeded again to the convent. She was readily admitted within the lodge; and, without any guide, reached the room where lay the Padre Outran. "I greet thee, holy padre," said she, adopting the priest's mode of salutation. "I return thy greeting, madame," replied the priest. "I have come to accept your offer of assistance." "It will be rendered promptly, if you pay well for it." "I will give thee ten thousand pounds sterling, holy padre, if' you will-will--" she hesitated. c Will what?" inquired the priest.     198        ANNIE WALLACE. "If you will rid me of that tormenting pest, Peter Wallace,"' said she, with an effort. "So, this is your mode of proving that love of which you boasted so largely yesterday, madame," said the priest, ironically. '"Thy witticisms are uncalled for, padre. What I wish to know is, whether you will do as I wish?" "I cannot take his life; but I will secure him, so that he will not molest you in a year or two." Mrs. Wallace thought a moment, and then replied: "I would like it better if you could rid me of him forever; but, still, that will be long enough, as, by that time, I can provide for him bet- ter than now.:' "You must pay the ten thousand pounds in cash, madame, before I make the least move." " If you wait for that, I cannot get the amount." "Nor I rid you of him." "Why, in case I do not come forward with the money, can you not easily let him loose on me again?" "You are right," replied the priest. "I will take measures immediately to cage him; he is too desperate a young man to run at large. Why, what do you think, the heretical dog would have choked me, if it had not been for the interference of his friend." "That is just like him, padre; he is an awful young man." Mrs. Wallace remained but a short time longer, and then returned to the city. She had not been gone twenty minutes from the priest's room, when Philip and Peter entered. "Good-day, padre," said Philip. "Good-day to thee, signore," replied the priest. "We have come, according to thy bidding, to learn the fate of Annie Wallace." "Unfortunately, signore, I shall have to beg thy patience for one day longer. I have some information, which I expect will be corroborated to-morrow." "Then, you can say nothing until then?" "I cannot," replied the priest.   SUCCESSFUL---VENGEANCE.        199 "I will retire," said, Philip; and he left the room, followed by Peter, determined to take measures to compel the priest to divulge his information. As they passed out, Padre Outran muttered: -"That wild young boy will not leave here to-morrow, I imagine." Philip and his companion soon reached their hotel, without accident, and retired to their room. CHAPTER XXX. SUCCESSFUL-VENGEANCE. IN the evening, as Peter was passing out of the hotel door, he was accosted by the gentleman with whom he had so suddenly come in contact in the morning: "Excuse me, sir; but, if I mistake not, this is Peter Wallace." "That is my name," replied Peter, returning the stranger's salutation. "You do not remember me," continued the stranger. "Your countenance is familiar, sir; still I cannot place you." "I am the Earl of Moray." "Now I remember you well, sir. It is a long time since we have met. How is your health, sirg?" "I am well," answered the earl; "but when did you arrive here?--and where did you leave your ship?" Peter here related to the earl a history of the circumstances which had occurred at the island of Penang; and how he had obtained leave to return to England to seek his sister Annie. Here the earl interrupted him by saying: "I suppose it was a severe disappointment, not finding your sister in Scotland?"     200         ANNIE WALLACE. "To say that I was disappointed, but poorly expresses the bitter grief I experienced to find her gone," said Peter, sadly. "Upon what day did you arrive in England?" inquired the earl. "( The twenty-sixth of December," replied Peter. "Then you arrived in England the very day that your sister sailed for Penang." "Sailed for Penang!" repeated Peter, starting back with aston- ishment.     ^ "Yes, sir; she sailed in the 'Grapeshot,' commanded by Captain Sands. I supposed you to be aware of it." "I had not the most remote idea of it. I came to Italy in search of her"-and, speaking abstractedly, he continued: " then I have wronged Mrs. Wallace after all." The earl, who had heard this last remark, said: "You would not think so if you knew all the cruel treatment Annie has received at her hands." "' Yes," replied Peter; " but I accused her of having my sister sent to the convent of the Sacred Hieart, with the intention of depriving her of her liberty. Anoie has certainly been there; and, until this moment, I suspected that she was still concealed there."            i "Your suspicions were correct," replied the earl; "your sister was confined in the convent, and kept there some time, through means of your step-mother and her accomplice."   : "What do you mean by accomplice; and how did Annie escape, and how came she to think of going to Penang," were questions asked by Peter in breathless surprie. "Softly, my dear fellow," replied& the earl; " one question at a time;" and he entered into a narrative of some of the events which had transpired, and with w ch the reader is already acquainted, ending by. escribing^their timely appearance in the chapel, and Annie s rescue and subsequent escape- in an American ship to England. Peter listened, with the most intense interest, to the tale.   SUCCESSFUL-VENGEANCE         201 When he had finished, he drew a long breath, as if relieved of a burden. C "You have my eternal gratitude, my lord; but how came Annie to think of such a thing as going to Penang?" "By some accident she became possessed of a letter addressed to your step-mother, from a relative of your mother, residing in Penang, and she resolved to go there," answered the earl. "And this Walter Jamieson," said Peter, through his clenched teeth, " where can he be found?" "I saw him at Rome," replied the earl. 'a Then to Rome I shall go; and, after punishing him for his outrages and insults, I shall follow my sister to Penang." "Come with me and see the countess," said Moray, and, by- the-by, avoid addressing me by my name, as I believe a price is offered for my apprehension, and I am incog. I was forced, by circumstances, to come here, notwithstanding the risk. Call me Murray. I do not think I shall be recognized." '"I hope not," replied Peter. ( Genoa is not like Eng- land." "But, Wallace," again urged the earl, " you must come with me and see my wife." If you will excuse me now," replied Peter, "I and my friend will come in the evening, and be presented to the countess, if you have no prior engagement." "None at all," said the earl; "the countess will be rejoiced to see Annie's brother"--and they parted, Peter to seek Philip, and recount to him the strange tale with which he had just been made acquainted, and the earl to inform the countess of the expected visitors. In accordance with the promise made to the earl, in the even- ing, Peter and Philip repaired to the rooms rof the earl and countess. The young gentlemen were charmed with the graceful, winning ma]ners of the beautiful countess. Much was said about Annie, and many things related to Peter of her manner of life since he had parted from her; and the hard, selfish spirit that Ars. Wallace had exercised towards poor Annie, was fully made     -202        ANNIE WALLACE. known to her brother. Peter felt more and more irritated towards the woman who, with such uncompromising avarice, had perse- cuted his darling sister. Notwithstanding the long separation between these two or- phans, a more than common affection bound them to each other. Their peculiar situation, being left alone in a strange land, with no other tie, naturally tended to cause them to cling ; to each other with a more intense love. Peter's heart was torn with agony to think of the terror, and suffering, and bitter insults poor Annie had been made to endure, with none- to aid her in her helplessness against the wicked wiles of Mrs. Wallace and her brother. "But I will punish them!" exclaimed he; " and you, my dear friends, who have rendered such efficient aid, in preventing this fiendish scheme from being carried out, you have my everlasting gratitude." Thus the evening passed, until the hour for retiring, when they parted, with mutual kfld wishes and regrets;.- The young men returned to their room, determined to start forr Rome the following day. Accordingly, the next morning, before daylight, they were on their way to that place, at which they arrived in due time, and proceeded directly to the hotel at which Jamieson had been staying when seen by the earl; but, to their disappointment, he had left, a few days previous, for Paris. Great was the rage and disappointment of Mrs. Wallace, when she found that Peter had escapd the snare intended for his destruction. Padre Outran had informed her of the appointment made to meet them next day, and also of his plan to dispose of him, which was this: To tell the young men, when they came, that he could not, by any means that he had used, find out where Annie was concealed; but there was one individual who did know, as he had been employed, as an assistant, in her removal -his own illness having preventied his having any personal   S UCCESSFUL--VENGEANCE.        203 knowledge of the matter. This person's silencehad been secured by bribes and threats; but, upon the promise of one thousand pounds, he had agreed to guide one of the young gentlemen, and only one, to a certain point, and give him all necessary directions for the rest. The padre well knew that Peter would choose to follow the guide himself, and thus fall into the trap laid for him, without its being apparent that the padre designed particularly that he should go. But the young men did not make their appearance at the time appointed; and, when the padre sent his secret emissaries to seek information, the parties had all left-the earl having departed a few hours subsequent to the others-and no clue could be obtained to their movements-Peter and Philip having taken the precau- tion to leave the city secretly. After some days spent in fruitless inquiries, Mrs. Wallace returned to Scotland, the victim of disappointment and anxiety that her wicked schemes had been frustrated, and in mortal. fear that all her heartless, criminal conduct would be brought to light. Here we will leave her for the present, reaping the whirlwind where she had sqwn the-wind. Not finding Jamieson, was a great disappointment to Peter; he panted to meet him, and demand satisfaction for his sister's wrongs. "They thought she was alone and unprotected," said he, "( with no refuge from their cruel machinations; but, thank God," he continued, with increased energy, "she has a refuge in her own fearless disposition, and a protector in me, her brother." It was three daqs ere they arrived in Paris. It was night, and rained furiously; and Peter was content to postpone his search until the next day, which proved to be fine. "Now, then," said Peter, as they left their hotel and wandered down the Boulevards, " there is no rest until we find that scoun- drel Jamieson." "But where are we to look for him, Peter?" inquired Philip. "We must visit- the gambling-hells of Paris."     204        ANNIE WALLACE, "Why, do you think you will find him at such a place T" "Moray told me to seek him there, if I did not find him at any of the hotels." Arm-in-arm they sauntered along the great promenade of Paris, until they reached one of the places they were in search of, and which was one of the principal establishments of the kind in Paris. Together they ascended a long flight of stairs, and entered a large room on the second floor, where parties of young men and old, of all descriptions-from the titled peer down to the seedy-looking gentleman-were scattered about, or gathered in squads, some smoking and drinking, others gambling, or en- gaged in boisterous conversation. It was not the hour when gaming was the all-absorbing amusement: it is only when dark- ness covers the earth, that even gamblers yield to this dark infatuation, with utter abandonment. Peter glanced his eye around the room, and regarded each individual with a scrutiniz- ing look. He had seen Walter Jamieson once or twice, and had thought he would remember him well enough to recognize him should he be present. "Do you see Jamieson?" inquired Philip. 4' I don't know, Philip," answered Peter; "I begin to doubt whether I should know him, if I did." 4"I hope you will not," thought Philip, who began to tremble in anticipation of the consequences of their meeting in such a place. Philip was a moralizer and a Christian gentleman, withal, \ and when he, in imagination, pictured to himself Peter lying mangled and lifeless on the ground, while anxious friends were awaiting his return, he murmured: "( And all this misery may be caused in a moment, to gratify a wicked feeling of-revenge." He had attempted, in two or three conversations, to dissuade Peter from seeking Jamieson in such a spirit, and had allude to Peter's advice to himself, to exercise moderation, and deliberate before he acted, at the time of his trouble with Harry Sunderland. But Peter uniformly answered, it was an entirely different case, and Philip's advice was unheeded. For some tige longer, the young men continued gazing about   SUCCESSFUL-VENGEANCE.         205 them, when the keeper of the saloon came forward, and addressed them:  "Bon jour, messieurs."  The young men returned his saluta- tion slightly, and he continued, blandly: "Shall I introduce you to our friends? I perceive you ares strangers." Peter, who understood French better than Italian, replied: "We will wait awhile;" when the Frenchman bowed politely, and walked away, in answer to the call of a party who seemed to desire his presence as umpire in a dispute. Peter followed with his eye the retreating form of the man, when he observed the; party that had called him. "Good heavens!" exclaimed Peter; "there is the bloody scoundrel, now!" "Hush, hush, Peter!" said Philip; "don't insult all in the room; you are not addressing any one in particular, and you do not know who may take it to themselves." "How shall I approach him?" said Peter, speaking partly to himself. "You had better not approach him at all," said Philip, his countenance betraying the concern he felt. "Surely, Philip, you are not a coward!" said Peter, excitedly; "No, I am not; but what would it avail your sister Annie, if you were killed in a melee with this man?" "I will have satisfaction!" replied Peter. The increasing excitement of the two young strangers, began to attract the attention of all within the room. As Philip cast his hasty glance around, he observed how conspicuous they were making themselves, and, taking Peter by the arm, led him to a retired corner of the room. As soon as they were seated, he said: "Now, Peter, deliberate before you act. Your sister Annie loves you as only those can love who are bereft of all other ties; her heart would be torn and broken, if you should fall in a i struggle with this man. Remember Noria, your newly-discovered sister; remember your grandfather, whose head is gray with age 18     206         ANNIE WALLACE, and grief for those already lost-he loves you as his son; and last, though not least, Peter, remember me. The peace and hap- piness of all would be destroyed, if you should fall. Annie is beyond the reach of this villain'; and he has done her no lasting injury-if either fall, sorrow and misery will follow. Jamieson has acted unprincipled and wicked, but he has done nothing worthy of death; and if he had, you have no right to take his life." "But I will deal fair with him: it is breast to breast. I'll not shoot him like a dog." "Don't shoot him at all, Peter; be not so selfish as to sacri- fice your friends to gratify your revenge. Now, my dear fellow, act the part of a Christian gentleman; show your utter detesta- tion of the fellow's conduct, but leave him to Him who has said: (Vengeance is mine; I will repay;' and who is able to punish him, or bring him to repentance?" "Philip, Philip," said Peter, in a tone of suppressed agony, "you rack my heart unnecessarily; you cannot change my pur- pose, and you are but causing me greater pain, by useless argu- ments." "Go, then, rash, inconsiderate boy," answered Philip, sorrow- fully; "you reproach me for racking your feelings, and you would recklessly sap the very essence of peace in our bosoms to gratify your revenge-to obtain satisfaction, as you call it. Jamieson caused Annie unhappiness for a season; but you, her brother, will make her miserable for life." "I yield!" exclaimed Peter, after a few moments' silence. "My friend, my brother, you have subdued the devil within me. But let us go from this place; the presence of that demon will rouse the evil spirit beyond control." "Come, then," said Philip, joyfully, and anxious'to get away before they should be noticed. Peter rose to folloe, and they had reached the centre of the spacious saloon, when Walter Jamieson (for he it was whom Peter had seen) caught sight of them; he recognized Peter in- stantly, and, with astonishing effrontery, he cried out:   SUCCE SFUL--VENGE ANCE.        207 "Holloa, Wallace, my good fellow, is that you?" and came forward with extended hand. Philip trembled with excitement, as also did Peter; but, cast- ing a deliberate look of mingled scorn and defiance at Jamieson, he turned to pass on to the door. A derisive laugh, from some of those who stood nearest, provoked Jamieson to put a bold face on the matter, although he had an instinctive perception that his unprincipled conduct was known, fro% Peter's manner.' "Holloa, there, Peter!" repeated he, in English, approaching nearer, and staring the young man impudently in the face. Peter could contain himself no longer, and he turned and spat in Jamieson's face. "You infernal puppy!'icried Jamieson, drawing a pistol from his bosom. He aimed steadily, and fired. Philip saw it, and, at the instant, drew Peter aside just in time to save his life. Casting off Philip's hold, Peter sprang towards Jamieson, and dealt him a blow in the face, which stretched him, full length, upon the floor. Peter threw himself upon him, when Philip and several others interfered, and took him off. Jamieson arose, wiping the blood from his forehead, while one of his friends stepped forward, and politely requested Peter to give him his card. Philip knew that it was too late now to prevent a meeting, and, yielding with sorrowful reluctance to what he knew the world deemed the necessities of the case, he handed a card from his pocket with their address upon it, -and hurried Peter from the room. Peter was in a state of high excitement; his better feelings, which had been brought into action by Philip's appeal, were vanished, and his lower nature was in the ascendant. An ex- pression of savage joy lit his countenance at the prospect of revenge. Not so Philip. Sadness and gloom were depicted in his face, and he made a passing remark upon the mistaken ideas that prevailed in the world with regard to honor, and giving hon- orable satisfaction. "Oh, my God, Philip!" exclaimed Peter with passionate energy; "' do you still blame me?"     208         ANNIE WALLACE. "No, no," said Philip, " you were not yourself. I am sorry, but it is too late now. I can only hope that you will not fall a victim to the world's false ideas of honor." "Fear not," said Peter; "I shall go to Penang with you yet." The excited gesticulations of the two young men began to attract considerable attention; and Philip called a coach, and they were driven to their hotel. Peter retired to take some repose, after the exciting events of the morning. CHAPTER XXXI. THE DUEL. As Peter anticipated, the following day brought a communi- cation from Walter Jamieson, demanding satisfaction for the insult he had received the day previous. The note was handed to Peter by the officious individual who had requested his card, immediately after the occurrence. "This is Mr. Peter Wallace?" said he. "That is my name, sir," replied Peter; and the fellow handed him the note, saying: "Colonel Young, at your service." Peter read Jamieson's note, which ran thus: C PARIS, Feb. 18, 18-- . "SIR:        t "After calmly considering the circumstance that happened yesterday, I have come to the conclusion that an apology is due from you to me.

JAMESON." '"P. S.--My friend, Colonel Young, will act in this matter, and will settle all preliminaries as you may decide. "i W. J." After reading the note, he turned to Philip, and said: "'Philip, will you arrange, with this gentleman, to the mutual satisfaction of Jamieson and myself?" "6 I will," said Philip, and Peter left the room. "You will act as second to Mr. Wallace, I suppose?" said the colonel, addressing Philip. "I will," replied Philip. "Have you decided what weapons oe choses to fight with? I suppose it is unnecessary to inform you that such a choice is al- lowed him?" 1"I am aware, sir, of the rules in such matters," replied Philip. "( He will fight with pistols." "At what distance?" ' Twelve feet." "And where shall they meet?" "Do you remember a small knoll, covered with trees, in a private garden in the suburbs of Paris, on the road to V----, known as Wood-Hill?" "I do, sir." "The meeting will take place there." "' At what hour?'" "At five o'clock, to-morrow morning." There was a silence of some moments, during which Colonel Young pretended to be examining an engraving which was sus- pended between the windows; turning to Philip suddenly, -he said, in a flippant sort of manner: "Before leaving, sir, I must say that I admire your -gentle- manly way of making arrangements for to-morrow's meeting.' I     210        ANNIE WALLACE. regret," continued he, taking out his snuff-box and helping him- self, with an air of nonchalance, "that anything of this kind should have occurred; but, of course, you know a gentleman's honor must be sustained." "1 Sir," replied Philip, coldly, and in a grave, haughty tone, i you will understand that this code of honor, to which you allude, has no place in my estimation of right and honorable conduct. Although affection for my relative will not permit me to desert him at this time, I am entirely opposed to the prac- tice of dueling ;" and, bowing coldly, he added: "I believe, sir, there is no necessity that this interview should be prolonged." Colonel Young bowed and left the room-his opinion of Philip's "gentlemanly way of making arrangements" very much qualified by his last speech and cavalier manner of dismissing him. As the door closed on his visitor, Philip turned to the window; a tear stood in his eye, and he murmured, in a voice choked with emotion: "O, my God! when will the world become sufficiently Christianized to discard such notions of honor! What misery- oh, what bitter anguish, will this affair occasion! Two human beings, created in the image of God, standing face to face with deadly weapons-and, oh, God! for what purpose?" and a shudder passed through his frame, as he continued: "' to take each other's life! Can there, oh, can there be a thought given to the immortality within, when man allows passion to take precedence of every nobler sentiment, and raise his hand, with murderous intent, against his brother? And this is honor! Honor," he repeated, contemptuously: "it is the coolest species of mur- der!"Philip was interrupted in his cogitations by the entrance of Peter. "Well, Philip," said he, "have you arranged for this bloody affair?" "Everything is arranged," replied Philip, "for you to lose a life or take a life." "Great God! what an alternative you present to my mind, Philip," said Peter. "Perhaps," he added, with a sigh, " it would have been better if I had heeded your advice. It is a solemn   THE DUEL.           2" thought you have waked up-that twenty-four hours may not elapse ere I am in eternity." The grave manner in which Philip had treated the subject was having its effect upon Peter's mind. Educated as he had been amongst a set of men who regarded the opinion of the world, on this subject, as their standard of right, and that a man was deficient in physical courage, who would have moral courage to act from a higher principle, he had never taken any other view of the matter; but now Philip had set things before him in a clearer light, and, with the true instincts of a noble nature, he shrunk from the guilt and responsibility he was about to incur, as well as the pain he should inflict on others. For some time they were both silent; at length Peter said, sadly: "But it is too late now to repent, and I shall be glad when it is over." "Why too late, Peter?" said Philip; "' why not decline to fight if you are convinced it is wrong?" "And be branded a coward," said Peter, somewhat indig- nantly. "And what then, Peter; do you fear man more than God?" "Philip, I acknowledge the weakness; still, in spite of the bitterness, the inexpressible agony that reflection brings to my mind, I am resolved to fight. Yes," continued he, becoming excited again, " passion rules me. Did I refuse to fight, I could never know peace. In my heart I would fight a million duels. Yes," said he passionately, as he pressed his throbbing brow, "I must fight, though I dare heaven and launch my soul in hell. I must fight-the future I will leave to itself," said he vehemently, as he strode back and forth across the room "Hold, Peter; calm yourself. If you continue thus you can do nothing." "You are right, Philip," said Peter; "I will control myself better-do not allude to the subject again. But had you not better make some arrangements for our departure." "That is a fact; I will attend to it immediately," and he arose and left the room. )     212         ANNIE WALLACE. Before night Philip had completed every arrangement for a hasty flight to England. About dusk he returned to the hotel. He found Peter grave, but firm and self-possessed. He desired to be left alone, and Philip retired to rest. Wearily the hours passed until near morning. Imagination spread out before Peter, with vivid reality, the bitter agony his death would cause his darling sister Annie; and he spent part of the hours of that sad night in writing to her. It was about two o clock when he had finished this and some other epistles, and he felt the necessity of dismissing thought and care of the future. He laid down and slept soundly until about four o'clock, when he was aroused by Philip. "Come, Peter," said he, shaking him roughly, "get up." "Yes, yes," replied Peter, "I will be on deck in a moment." Dreams had carried him to his ship. Philip shook him again, when he languidly opened his eyes. "You must dress quickly, Peter," said Philip, " if you wish to be on the ground in time." In a moment Peter was on his feet, and commenced dressing as calmly as though he was only preparing for a walk. A won- derful change had taken place in Peter, and Philip, who began to have some apprehension in regard to his firmness, now felt confident that he would conduct himself with coolness and courage. Peter was no coward. Ever since his acceptance of the chal-k lenge, it was not the terror of fighting that caused him such agony-it was the realization of all the consequences. At twenty minutes past four o'clock they started for the place appointed for the encounter, where they arrived just seven minutes before the time. The only person on the ground was the doctor, whom Philip had been deputed to engage. 'r Good-morning, doctor," said Philip. "Good-morning, gentlemen," replied the doctor. "It is a fine, clear morning," he continued, addressing Peter. "Very," replied Peter, calmly. "I hope, gentlemen," resumed the doctor, "that this affair will 4Lc,',e   THE DUEL.            213 be amicably settled yet, without coming to a bloody termina- tion." "I think it is impossible, sir," replied Peter. Three minutes later, Jamieson arrived on the ground, accom- panied by his second, Colonel Young. The colonel appeared to be in high spirits, seemingly anticipating considerable amuse ment. After conversing a moment with Jamieson, he walked up to Philip, and, bowing very politely, said: "Is your friend still determined to fight, or will he apolo- gize?' "He will fight, sir," said Philip-and they measured off the distance. Philip now came to inform Peter that all was ready. Peter walked calmly to his place, while a quiet, sarcastic smile played around his lips. He betrayed no trepidation, but was easy, graceful, and unembarrassed in his movements, and appeared not at all excited. With Jamieson it was different. He was pale, restless, and excited, though not afraid. He had sufficient courage, but he was not an experienced duelist; -and, in spite of his geat efforts to appear calm and undisturbed, he was evidently nervous. They took their positions after the ground had been measured out. Colonel Young informed them that they were to raise their pistols ready to fire. "The words are-one, two, three-fire." Philip shook hands with Peter, and said to him, in a low tone: ( Be careful, Peter; do not wound him in a vital part if you can help it"-and then stepped aside. Colonel Young called out, rapidly, " one, two, three-fire;" but, at the word three, Jamieson fired, and Peter's pistol was discharged downward, as his arm fell useless at his side. Jamieson had evidently, according to pre- arrangement, fired before the word was given--he was, of course, unhurt. Philip trembled with, excess of indignation at this foul trick. With his teeth firmly set, he walked up to Jamieson, and said: "Jamieson, you are a damned scoundrel and cheat. Colonel Young, you are a scoundrel; but your trick is discovered." a                   ,  .     214        ANNIE WALLACE. "What trick?" inquired the colonel, affecting great sur- prise. "Jamieson fired before the word was given. It was evidently preconcerted. My friend has been foully dealt with; and," con- tinued Philip, forgetting, in the heat of his passion, all the lessons of wisdom and moderation with which he had labored so hard to prevent this meeting, "I challenge Jamieson to a second trial with me-the doctor will act as my second, and give the signal to fire." "I will not fight you," replied Jamieson. "I have no quarrel with you." "Then you are a coward and villain," said Philip; " and I will have you both arrested for an attempt at murder." Jamieson was violently agitated, while the colonel pretended to be greatly enraged. He stormed and blustered about; but Philip repeated his threats, and his opinion of their dastardly con- duct. Suddenly, Jamieson stepped forward, and, in a voice choked with passion, exclaimed: "I will bear this insolence no longer; the consequences be upon your own head. I will fight you, sir!" Peter, whose arm was broken, had observed Philip talking with Jamieson while the doctor was setting his arm. As Philip came towards him, he said: "Well, Philip, I have fought, and am not killed yet, though it seems strange to me that I should have missed the signal to fire." "You did not," said Philip; "you were shot by foul means. Now, don't say one word, as you value my friendship; but I am going to fight Jamieson.  Doctor, will you act as my second?" "I will," replied the doctor, who had seen through Jamieson's trick, and was incensed against him. Before Peter could inter- fere, Philip had taken his stand opposite Jamieson; and again, for a minute, awful silence prevailed, when the word was distinct- ly given-fire! Both pistols were discharged, and Jamieson fell. Philip was W*   BAD NEWS-THE SHPWRECK.         215 unhurt.  The doctor went immediately to the wounded man. He found him lying senseless on the ground. He felt his pulse. "There is life," he replied, in answer to Philip's inquiry. Tearing open his shirt, he discovered that the ball had entered his left shoulder. Philip and his companion waited but a short time longer, and then entered a carriage that was waiting for them a few rods off; and, from that very spot, they started en route for England. No incident worth relating attended their flight. They were not pursued. Peter suffered considerable pain from his fractured arm. They arrived in Edinburgh in as short time as possible. They were forced to travel slowly on account of Peter's arm, which he carried in a sling. Upon their, arrival in Edinghurgh, they put up at their old quarters, mnd engaged the services of an eminent surgeon. CHAPTER    XXXII. BAD NEWS-THE SHPWRECK. MR. MONTGOMERY, the lawyer, was sitting in his little back- room, when the office-door opened, and Peter Wallace saluted him. "Good-morning, Mr. Montgomery," said Peter, taking a seat. "Good-morning. When did you arrive in Edinburgh?" said the lawyer, rising. "Yesterday morning, sir." "And were you successful in obtaining your sister's libera- tion?" She was at liberty before I arrived in England.     216        ANNIE WALLACE. "What!" said the lawyer, quickly; 'C was she never confined there? I thought my information came from so reliable a source that there could be no chance of mistake." "There was no mistake, sir," replied Peter. "My sister was confined, as you stated; but she was forcibly rescued before my arrival, by two gallant young gentlemen of this city." "Then where is she?" inquired the lawyer. "I have not heard of her return to Scotland." "She never did return to Scotland," Peter answered. "She sailed for Penang a short time after her escape from Italy." "Then you have great reason to rejoice, my young friend, for your sister was miserable while subject to the continual annoy- ances of Mrs. Wallace. But what have you determined to do in regard to the many frauds committed by your step-mother on your bankers, Messrs. Granville & Co.?" "Punish her to the full extent of the law, and, if possible, have the control of the property transferred to my grandfather, who will give bonds as security for his proper and just adminis- tration of the estate." "That, I , I think, will be a difficult matter," said the lawyer. ( It is more than likely that the law will appoint an executor, and then, good-by to the estate for your lifetime." "Well, what would you advise me to do, Mr. Montgomery?" "I would advise you to go to your bankers, and state all the circumstances to them, and leave proof in confirmation of your statements. You can then direct them to dishonor her drafts until the sum she has squandered has been refunded from the income settled on her by your father." "Yes, but then she will sie Messrs. Granville & Co. for with- holding legal deposits." "She can easily be frightened out of that, if you manage right." "You must direct me how to manage then, sir: it was for that purpose called upon you." "' Very well, I will accompany you to Messrs. Granville & Co.'s, and if the matter be properly explained to them, and if you will   BAD NEWS-THE SHPWRECK.        217 guarantee to bear the expenses of a lawsuit, they will willingly withhold money from her in future. If she be not satisfied thus to refund, they can commence an action against her for fraud." "That will do, sir," said Peter, after thinking awhile. "It is the best way of settling it," replied the lawyer, "because it will save expense, trouble, and time, and also keep the estate out of chancery." Accordingly, that same morning, Peter, accompanied by Mr. Montgomery, called upon his bankers. They received him cor- dially, and, upon his stating the facts, the senior partner of the firm admitted that, for some time past, he had doubted the veracity and honesty of Mrs. Wallace. He readily approved Mr. Mont- gomery's plan, ,nd promised Peter that henceforth none of the checks signed by Mrs. Wallace should be paid until sufficient had been withheld to replace what had been overdrawn. After settling his business satisfactorily, Peter returned to his hotel, where he arrived in time for dinner; after which the two young men went out for a stroll, and Peter informed his companion of what he had done in regard to Mrs. Wallace. "I think it would have been better to go to law at once," said Philip. "I do not," replied Peter; " and Mr. Montgomery counseled my present course." Mongom            conseled "Well, of course he knows best; but, are you not assuming powers which are not legally yours?" "Not at all, Philip, not atall. Mrs. Wallace dare not resist, even if I did." "But your other guardians may, I should think." "The only thing they can object to, is my drawing money without their endorsement; but if Granville & Co. are willing to give it to me, that is not my fault; they alone are responsi- ble. Still, they are safe enough." "When do you intend to sail for Penang?" inquired Philip, suddenly changing the conversation. "I cannot tell," answered Peter; "I must wait here until the Wimberton' arrives." 19     218        ANNIE WALLACE. "Why must you wait her arrival?" "I was ordered to remain in England until her return, and I cannot leave without permission." "Is there no person empowered to grant permission?" inquired Philip. ' Yes, but I would rather wait," answered Peter. That evening, as he was reading a Liverpool journal, just re- ceived, he was startled by seeing an article headed thus: "FIRE AT SEA-DESTRUCTION OF THE ' GRAPESHOT.--The ship Sir William,' Captain James, arrived yesterday, and reports see- ing the hull of a ship, floating, supposed to have been destroyed by fire." Peter could read no further: his head swam, and, for a mo- ment, he was blinded. He sat thus for some minutes, the paper clasped tightly in his hand. A sickening feeling, of the most harrowing anxiety for the fate of his sister, filled his heart. Recovering himself by a strong effort, he again read to the end of the paragraph: ' The captain of the 'Sir William' lowered a boat, and sent the first mate to examine the remains of the vessel. It was ascertained to be the 'Grapeshot.' It is suspected that the 'Grapeshot' was bound for the East Indies. As there were no traces of any bodies, it is hoped that passengers and crew may all have escaped. "P. S.-Since the above went to press, it has been discovered that the ' Grapeshot' was an American ship, commanded by Captain Sands, chartered by Messrs. Fenton, Jones & Co., of Liverpool, to bring a return cargo. She sailed on the 2th December, with fifty-eight passengers on board. It is hoped that all were saved on board some passing ship." Peter reperused the paragraph, and as he laid the paper aside, murmured: Oh, my God! what new trial is this! Is there no peace-no hope for me  M5ust I endure this suspense, before her fate is   BAD NEVrS---THE SHPWRECK.       219 known? Oh! merciful Father! I call upon thee for strength to bear up under this new affliction." The door opened, and Philip entered. He, also, had read the account, and was hastening to break the dreadful intelligence to Peter. One look informed him that the news he brought was already known. "My dear Peter," he commenced, "do not despair; hope for the best; she may be safe. Public opinion pronounces the pas- sengers safe-there is hope." "A bare spark of hope," said Peter. "Then nurse that little spark, until there is no hope. I think the passengers have escaped, or there would have been some remains by which the mate of the packet would have known they had perished."       I "They may have all jumped overboard, or some may have been saved; but Annie, my poor Annie, is lost." "Peter, do not give up, until you are assured, beyond a doubt, that she has perished." By such persuasions as these, Philip succeeded in fanning the "bare spark of hope," that faintly illumined Peter's anticipations, into a bright, glowing flame. Peter once again was hopeful; he anticipated seeing his sister yet. Fancy presented her among the rescued, carried to some distant shore. The next morning Peter and Philip started for Liverpool, for the purpose of being there to meet Annie, should it so happen that she had been fortunate enough to have escaped on board of a ship bound homeward. They arrived in Liverpool, and waited two weeks, without hearing anything concerning the fate of the passengers that sailed in the ill-fated "Grapeshot;" but, at the  end of that time, a Liverpool and New York packet arrived, and reported having spoken the ship "Wild Eagle," commanded b Captain Jenkins, who stated that he had rescued the passe and crew from off the "Grapeshot," which vessel ha stroyed by fire. The captain of the "Wild EagI captain of the packet to take the passengers of them back to England; but, as he had            220         ANNIE WALLACE. cient for what passengers were already on board, he refused to receive them, and they were carried to New York. This news seemed to be the realization of Peter's hopes. So sudden and with such soul-thrilling gladness was it received, that his wish to behold her seemed gratified. "Annie is safe!" was his frequent exclamation. Philip shared the joy of Peter; and, so interested had he be- come in Annie's fate, and so often was she the theme of conver- sation, that Philip imagined he knew her already. His lively imagination pictured her graceful form and features; and, from the expression of her eyes, he read the noble qualities of her soul, and the secret yearnings of her heart. For some time after the reception of this last news, Peter was undecided whether it was his duty to wait in England the return of his ship. It was his earnest wish to be ready to resume his post of duty on the arrival of the "Wimberton." But where was Annie? In a land of strangers, perhaps, reduced to poverty. He could not endure the thought; he would follow her; and, after coming to this decision, he applied for permission to leave, in the quarter necessary, and succeeded; and, in a few days, bidding adieu to Philip, took passage on board a packet, and was on his way to the Western World. We will now leave him and return to Annie.   CHAPTER XXXIII. THE STORM. WE left Annie just seeking her berth, after gazing upon the distant, indistinct shores of England, for the last time. The next morning being clear, and much warmer than it had been the previous night, Annie went upon deck. Having been at sea before, she experienced no great inconvenience from the rolling motion of the-ship-whose movement upon the broad Atlantic was quite different from the waters of the Mediterranean. This time Annie was neither surprised nor disheartened by the appear- ance of her persecutor, Walter Jamieson; that individual, as we have seen, being left behind-though not willingly. She was surprised at her own cheerfulness; her destiny seemed as bright as the brilliant sunlight which poured upon the light clouds, and made them look so beautiful, as they floated, slowly and grace- fully, between the dark waters of the ocean and the blue arch above. Annie ascended through the companion-way, and, going to the quarter-deck, she seated herself upon the same spot which had been her resting-place the night before, when those happy, cheerful thoughts, which now pervaded her soul, first arose, and partially dispelled the shadowy gloom of sorrow that had enve- loped her feelings. Annie sat for some time gazing upon the waves sparkling and dancing in the sunbeams; when she was disturbed in her reverie by the voice of Captain Sands. "Good-morning, Miss Wallace," said he. Annie turned around, and, in a cheerful tone, returned his salutation; when the captain resumed:     222        ANNIE WALLACE. "It is quite a different morning from what it was the first time you came on deck with your spirited blue-eyed friend." Annie's countenance changed, and an expression of sadness flitted momentarily across it, as the captain recalled to her recollection her only true friend, whom she had left so far behind. "Excuse me, Miss Wallace, if I have called up unpleasant associations." "O, you have not, sir," Annie answered; " it was not an un- pleasant association you stirred up. It was almost the only pleasant recollection I have to dwell upon." At this moment they were joined by a bright; graceful young girl, who advanced quickly towards the captain, saying: "Good-morning, papa." "Good-morning, my daughter," replied the captain, fondly; and, turning to Annie, he said: "This is my daughter, Miss Wallace "Amy," he continued, " this is Miss Wallace ; the lady I spoke to you about." Both the young ladies were evidently pleased; and, after exchanging salutations, Annie said, taking Amy by the hand: "We must become good friends during the course of this long voyage." "I hope so," replied Amy, which was the name of the captain's daughter. "' I hope so, too," said the captain; "but I will leave you to yourselves now ;" and he walked awayvtoward the forward part of the vessel. "Do you like my father?" inquired Amy Sands, innocently, as the captain left them. Annie was surprised and amused by such a question; and she replied: "Please, tell me first why you ask, Amy?" "O, because it makes me happy to have one love my father; he is so good." "Well, then, I do like him very much."   THE STORM.           223 "I am so glad," replied Amy, sweetly. "But here comes my mother," she continued, as a fine-looking woman approached them. Amy introduced Annie to her mother; and, saying that she had forgotten something, she returned to the cabin. Mrs. Sands, the wife of the captain, was a fine specimen of an American lady. She was retiring and gentle in her manners, with a lovely face, and upon her lip sat a sweet smile. Her countenance betrayed a warm, generous heart, and a kind, gentle disposition. Her manners were quiet and dignified ; and, altogether, Annie thought her a very lovely woman, and felt quite certain that she was really possessed .of all the sweetness of disposition that she seemed to be. After the introduction, Mrs. Sands inquired, in a soft, musical voice, whether Annie anticipated being sea-sick. Annie replied that she did not. "Have you been to sea, before?" inquired Mrs. Sands. "I have," answered Annie; "I was born at sea, during a fierce gale." "Oh, then you are quite at home on the water." "Well, no, Mrs. Sands; I cannot say that I am exactly at home. I feel very strange and timid when I stand and gaze into these fearful depths." "Then you are different from me; for I love to gaze upon the ocean, and I feel more contented at sea than I do on shore." "That is because you are with your husband, I suppose." ' That may be one reason; still, I like the sea. My father was a captain, and I sailed with him every trip he made for eight years before I was married. Since my marriage, I have sailed a great deal with my husband." "Does your daughter always accompany you?'" inquired Annie. "Not always," replied Mars. Sands; "she has been at school in the south of France, for the last three years, and is very anxious to return to America." "'When does your husband intend returning with her?"     224         ANNIE WALLACE. "After this trip, I hope, on Amy's account, she is so anxious to go. She says she will never leave New York, to go to sea again." "How long has your husband followed the vocation of a sea- captain?" "For forty years." "I should suppose he would soon begin to think of remaining on shore." "Well, I do not know; he says he will, after this voyage; but he has been to sea so long, I hardly think he will be able to keep his promise, and content himself on shore." For some time longer, Annie and Mrs. Sands remained con- versing, until she was called away by her daughter. Annie was very well pleased with both the wife and daughter of the captain, and anticipated much enjoyment in their society during the voyage to Pulo Penang. For ten days longer, the "Grapeshot " was favored with fair weather, and made rapid progress towards her destined port. But upon the morning of her twelfth day out, when Annie came on deck, her cheerfulness was dampened upon beholding the threatening aspect of the heavens. As she stepped from the companion-way, the captain, as he passed her, said: "I think you had better remain below, this morning, Miss Wallace."  "Do you think we are going to have a storm?" inquired Annie. "Yes, miss; appearances foretell a fierce one, and ladies are always safer below deck upon such occasions." "Oh, I should like, of all things, to remain and see a storm," replied Annie, suddenly possessed with the desire 6f seeing the ocean in its fury. atYou cannot, Miss Wallace," repeated the captain rather sternly. Annie turned upon him a look of surprise, which the captain observed, and said: "You must not notice my rough way of addressing you, Miss   THE STORM.           225 Wallace, nor think me a harsh man; but this is a time when I must assume a tone of command, and speak with sternness to every one, if I wish to save my noble vessel and its passengers from a watery grave." "I will go below immediately," said Annie. "That's a good girl; you may rest assured that I would will- ingly allow you to remain, if it were proper." "Oh, I believe you, captain, and I was very foolish and incon- siderate to wish it." And Annie went below, while the captain walked forward, and gave orders to reduce their canvas, and make all necessary preperations for the approaching storm." "We shall have it pretty soon, Mr. Hardlin," said the captain  and, as he spoke, he cast an anxious look around at the state of  the weather. The wind now commenced to blow a real gale; the ship rolled and lurched, making it difficult to keep a firm footing. "You are right," replied the mate; " the old ' Grapeshot' will have a fierce struggle, but we shall weather it." "Have everything in trim," said the captain. ( Ay, ay, sir," responded Mr. Hardlin. At this time the ship was riding swiftly before the gale, with but a small portion of canvas unfurled. Stronger and steadier blew the wind, and swifter shot the noble ship along, her bows ploughing through the crested waves, while the rain began to pour down in torrents. When Annie went below deck she sought Mrs. Sands, who, with her daughter, was sitting in the cabin, reading. As Annie en- tered, they laid aside their books. "We are going to have an awful storm," said Annie. !"Have you been on deck?" inquired Mrs. Sands. "' I have," Annie answered, " and would have liked to remain there." Mrs. Sands smiled, while she said: r "The captain would not permit that, I am sure." "He would not,"replied Annie; "' and I can readily see that it is not proper or safe for me to be there."     226         ANNIE WALLACE. At this moment, the ship suddenly careened, and threw Annie with such force against the side of the cabin, that she was, for a few moments, stunned and senseless. Mrs. Sands and Amy were also thrown down, but regained their feet immediately, and has- tened to raise Annie from the floor. "Bring water, Amy,"- said Mrs. Sands, calmly. Amy, pale with fear and apprehension, hastened after water, while Mrs. Sands laid Annie on her bed in her state-room, where she soon revived. "Are you hurt, Miss Wallace?" "Not much," said Annie; "my poor head got rather a hard bump." The sudden careening of the vessel had been some mismanage- ment of the helmsman. His carelessness had nearly lost the ship; but, by the admirable coolness and skill of the mate, she was righted, and put before the wind again, which, in the mean- time, had increased to a perfect hurricane. The captain stood before the gangway, his sturdy, compact frame braced against the fierce wind, his handsome, sun-browned face turned towards the heavens, gazing upon the magnificent scene, with awe and admiration. Captain Sands was an edu- cated man; he had an eye for the beautiful and sublime in nature; he had boundless sea-room and a good ship, and he felt as secure against danger as if in his own home on the banks of the Hudson. Overhead was one dense mass of black, ominous clouds; the vivid lightning played incessantly, illuminating this immense volume of dark, floating mist; while the sharp rattling of the heavy thunder rendered the scene indescribably awful and sublime. The captain was aroused by the voice of the mate, who observed that he " thought they had not yet experienced the full fury of the storm." "With this ship and an open sea we are safe enough." ' I know that, sir," replied the mate. "It is not the wind or the waves I fear-though that is threatening enough-but the red lightning is playing nearer and nearer around our masts."   THE STORM.           227 "I don't think there is much to apprehend from the lightning, Mr. Hardlin." "One of the crew is blinded already, sir." W"Who?" inquired the captain, quickly. '- That new hand we last engaged." "Poor fellow," observed the captain, " it has proved an unfor- tunate stoim for him. Is his sight hopelessly lost?" "Yes, hopelessly lost," replied the mate. ) Presently the second mate came running towa ds the captain. It was our old friend-the tall Yankee who haprotected Annie from the rudeness of Jamieson. "By golliofferous!" cried the Yankee, "if we don't run away from that lightning we'll be a-fire, as sure as guns." !"So Mr. Hardlin thinks," said the captain; " but I must say, I do not feel as fearful as either one of you." "By gol, then, we'll be roast meat yet, or else go to Davy Jones' locker." "Why, do you really think there is as much danger as that?" inquired the captain, for the first time becoming alarmed. "That's my opinion, captain; every flash strikes nearer." ' Prepare for fire, then," cried the captain; " have every pail and water-holding vessel on board the ship ready for use." "Ay, ay, sir," replied both the mates, as they hurried away to obey the captain's order. The captain paced the deck rapidly, and every moment cast anxious glances upward towards the threatening heavens. "Oh, my God!" he ejaculated; "after forty years' safe voyag- ing, with an open sea and good ship, am I to be lost with my family? O, my poor, innocent child, and thou, my sweet wife, have you both lived but for this moment?"And the captain cast one more anxious glance towards heaven, and hurried to'the cabin to seek his wife and Amy.      CHAPTER     XXXIV. STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. THE ship was plunging forward through the boiling water with bare poles; not a spot of canvas had the tearing wind left unripped; yet rapidly she flew along, though louder roared the angry winds, and more frequent and nearer flashed the lurid streaks of electric fire, even now more brilliant in contrast to the dark volumes of clouds that it illuminated. Suddenly the ship was borne high upon the summit of a mighty wave, when, for an instant, there was a bright light in the imme- diate vicinity of the forward part of the ship, and the next moment, simultaneously with the report of two opposing clouds, was heard the crash of splintered timbers. "She's struck! she's struck!" was the heart-rending cry that rose from the affrighted crew, as they wildly rushed aft, repeat- ing that awful spirit-crushing cry, " she's struck! she's struck!" When Captain Sands reached the cabin, he found his wife upon her knees; at her side was his daughter. Amy's hair fell free upon her shoulders, and a painful look of despair sat upon her countenance. She, also, with her face turned upward towards heaven, was praying. The father gazed for a moment, and, as a sob struggled in his bosom, he rushed into the cabin and clasped his wife and daughter in his arms. "My husband!" exclaimed the wife. "My father!" cried the daughter. And they rushed towards him. "Is there no hope?" inquired his wife. "There is," replied the captain; " we can always hope, but we know not what-"   STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.        22 9 The captain stopped short; he heard the 'terrible crash on deck. There was a moment's pause-the next minute he heard the dreadful cry of the crew-"She's struck! she's struck!" "Throwing up his arms wildly, he exclaimed: "We are lost; the ship is struck by lightning!" "Father!" screamed his daughter; and she fell from his arms senseless upon the cabin-floor. "Wife!" cried the husband, "attend to our daughter; I must return on deck." "No, no, my husband, remain and die with us i Do not leave your daughter!" Clasping her once more in his arms, and imprinting a kiss upon hew brow, Captain Sands answered, in a voice choked with grief: "I cannot stay with you, dear wife; my duty is on deck. If I do not see you again, good-by. In heaven we shall meet again. My daughter," he repeated, " good-by." "Husband!" cried the wife, clinging to him, "do not leave us; stay with me and Amy." In his first surprise and anxiety for the loved ones, occasioned by the terrible crash, Captain Sands had forgotten that there might still be hope of saving the ship; but a few moments restored him to himself. Releasing himself from the frantic embrace of his wife, he seated her upon a sofa, saying: -"I cannot stay with you, ,dearest, best-beloved: .fifty-eight souls have intrusted them- selves to my experience and seamanship. I have been wrong to remain so long. Farewell, wife! farewell, daughter!"And the captain rushed on deck. The storm was passing over, the wind blew less fiercely, the lightning flashed at longer intervals, and -the thunder rolled its dread artillery at a greater distance: they had safely rode out the fury of the tempest, to be destroyed by an element more terrific and relentless. As the captain reached- the deck he was met by the second mate, who exclaimed: "Captain, the ship is on fire!" 20     230         ANNIE WALLACE.  "' I know it," replied the captain; - but where did it strike 9" "Near the forward hatch.  It tore through the deck, and ignited those goods that were saturated with oil by the bursting of a cask. The flames have spread rapidly, and set fire to everything combustible in that part of the ship, and it increases, in spite of the efforts of the men to quench it. My hands are badly burn- ed," continued he, as he held his scorched arms up to view of the captain. "' We must try to save the ship," said the captain, calmly. He had regained his self-possession, and was prepared to bring all the power and energy of his mind, and long experience, into action. '"Holloa there, Mr. Hardlin!" cried the captain. "Ay, ay, sir," answered the first mate, as he dashed a bucket of water on the fierce flames. "What hope is there?" "None, sir! We are lost unless God save us: no human power can. In three hours, at this rate, we shall burn to the water's edge." ("She must not," answered the captain and uniting in the endeavors of the mate and crew, every exertion was made to subdue the raging element. Long and tireless were their efforts; but all was fruitless. In spite of everything, the flames steadily and surely increased. At first every aperture was closed, to try to smother the flames; water was thrown upon the decks con- tinually; but all was useless-the fire would burst through at different points, until, at last, all hope was abandoned of saving the ship. Annie had been a sorrowful spectator of the interview between the captain and his family; and when Amy fell upon the floor, Annie ran to her assistance. . A pitcher of water stood upon the table; she raised the senseless girl, and commenced bathing her temples. As soon as Captain Sands left the cabin, she was joined and assisted by Mrs. Sands. It was some time before she showed signs of returning consciousness; but as she opened her eyes, Mrs. Sands murmured:   STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.         231 "Dear child'! I do not know but it would have been a mercy to leave her unconscious." "Why, my dear madam, do you say so-are we in such peril?" "I fear the worst, Miss Wallace-the ship is struck by light- ning. Our danger is great, indeed." Amy, after the first signs of returning life, revived rapidly, and in a short time was able to sit up. Looking around at the anx- ious faces of her mother and Annie, she remembered the fearful words her father had spoken. Turning to her mother, with a countenance full of terror, she asked: "Is there no chance of rescue, dear mother-must we perish?" "My precious child, there is one hope," replied the mother, whose heart was filled with agony for her child. "Then we may yet be saved," exclaimed Amy. "Possibly, my child: while there is life there is hope. God is able to open a way of escape for us even now; but for the noble old ' Grapeshot,' there is little hope I fear." Presently they were startled by a wild cry on deck; and as Mrs. Sands ran towards the hatchway, she caught a glimpse of flames. Rushing back into the cabin, she threw the passengers into a wild confusion, by exclaiming: ' The ship is on fire!" We have confined ourselves to an account of the feelings and :cOnversations df our friends, from which fact the reader may have supposed that there were no others on board; but the "Grape- shot" carried a large number of passengers for the time of year. Most of them, if not all, had suffered the vibrations of fear and hope. During the storm they had been assembled in the cabin, and had heard the announcement that the ship had been struck by lightning; but not one had comprehended, or had the least suspicion, that the fire had communicated to the ship; and now, when Mrs. Sands announced so suddenly that the ship was on fire, the utmost terror and confusion prevailed-the passengers made a grand rush for the deck, leaving Mrs. Sands alone with her daughter and Annie.     232         ANNIE WALLACE. Mrs. Sands turned to Annie, and made a remark concerning the calmness the passengers had displayed hitherto; but Annie was incapable of making any reply-she was overcome with terror at the prospect of so horrible a fate. She sank upon her knees, and attempted to pray. She had always believed herself a Christian, but, alas! she had never been a praying one; and now, amid the terrible scenes which were transpiring around her, she re- alized that she had not that faith and confidence in approaching her Maker that a true Christian should possess. Her tongue refused to move, and she was speechless. Mrs. Sands and Amy came and knelt by her side, and, clasping her hands together, the anxious mother poured out her petition in words of supplica- tion; and the crushing weight was lifted from her sinking heart. Annie's situation was dreadful. Every moment, she felt, might be her last; yet she could not realize that such was to be her fearful fate. Her head seemed bound in an iron skull, which grew smaller and smaller, pressing each moment heavier upon her brain; and such a weight seemed to lay upon her bosom that she could hardly breathe. At last, she murmured: "Father, have mercy!"Those three words broke through the dense clouds of misery that were destroying her senses; her heart was re- lieved; her tongue regained its power, and she petitioned God for strength-she prayed for forgiveness. Earnestly she pleaded for mercy and fortitude in this hour of distress, both for herself and others; and her prayer was heard. When she arose from her humble posture, she was calm; and even in this dark hour, when, at any moment, she might be snatched from earth, with the fiery element raging fiercely about her, amidst the cries and agonized screams of those about her, she was resigned and strong in hope. She had no fear. She gazed upon the devouring flames, and, with kind voice, sought to soothe and encourage the others. Yea, during these fleeting moments, when she was expecting so soon to be separated forever from her dear brother Peter, whom she had so longed to see, and who was continually in her thoughts, when every earthly tie was to be severed, Annie was cahn. Hope, brighter and stronger, and a purer faith, glowed   THE BURNING SHP-HOURS OF PERIL.      233 in her heart, and fixed her vision upon a surer and more lasting foundation; her mind soared beyond the riches, and honors, and friendships of earth, to that bright world of peace beyond the skies, and she murmured: "There all my hopes will be realized; it is for that peace my heart has long yearned." Yes, that had been the invisible phantom which had aroused hope in her bosom during other trying scenes; and now she felt it glowing within her with a brightness which made its picturings almost real. She was strong: her strength was in- her Redeemer. CHAPTER XXXV. THE BURNING SHP-HOURS OF PERIL. EVERY moment increased the peril of the passengers on board the "Grapeshot." Suddenly, the startling cry was circulated from mouth to mouth, that the fire had broken out amid-ships. Mrs. Sands was standing on deck, near the mizzen-mast; at her side stood her daughter Amy and Annie Wallace, watching, with intense anxiety, the progress of the raging element; and now the cry reached her that the fire had burst out amid-ships, and that the captain, with the first mate and three men, were be- tween the two fires. Looking upward, she murmured: "Father, he is in thy hands; thy will be done." Annie was filled with admiration at such an exhibition of faith and resignation. She felt that she could be calm when she herself was in danger; but if one she loved, as she knew Mrs. Sands loved her husband, were in such awful peril, Annie thought she would have rushed through the flames and joined him. The excitement of the passengers was intense. Their position seemed one of safety, compared with that of the captain and his men;     234        ANNIE WALLACE. and they besought the second mate to make an effort to rescue him from his immediate peril. The mate called to four of the men to launch the jolly-boat. One of them replied: "It will not live a moment hn such a sea." By golly, it must die, then," answered the courageous Yankee; "but we must not let the captain roast between two fires, at any rate."' The men did not wait a second bidding; and, in a few moments, succeeded in lowering a boat over the starboard side of the vessel. They had great difficulty in preventing its being dashed immediately to atoms; but, finally, after much trouble and skill, they succeeded in getting into her, and placing their oars in the oar-locks, and pulling from thS side of the vessel. Anxiously the lookers-on watched the brave seamen, as they skillfully worked their boat. towards the forward part of the ship. In another moment they were enveloped in the dark cloud of smoke that crept over the water from the burning part of the vessel, and hidden from their sight. Ten minutes of dreadful suspense were endured-most agonizing minutes to the wife and daughter-when they were cheered by a shout, as the boat reappeared, bearing the captain and his men. The mate had pulled to that part of the ship, between the main-mast and bow, where the captain stood, surrounded by scorching flames, and had succeeded, by almost superhuman efforts of strength and skill, in bearing them off in their boat. When Captain Sands ascended to the deck, he passed among the passengers, addressing to them words of encouragement, and hope glimmered in their bosoms. "Let no one attempt to leave the ship at present," said he. "The sea is getting smoother, and, in an hour, our boats can safely ride upon the waves." 1"But how are we going to exist an' hour?" inquired a gentle- man-one of the passengers. "The flames are sweeping this   THE BURNING   SHP-HOURS OF PERIL.    235 way, and we know not at what moment they may burst up under our feet." C"No, sir," replied the captain; " there is no chance of that. All the light freight is consumed now." "But won't the flames reach us in less than an hour?" inquired another of the anxious-group. "I think not," said Captain Sands. "Crowd as far aft as you possibly can, and you will be safe for an hour, and, perhaps, longer." The words, short as the reprieve, were heard with joy by the passengers; and, as his wife heard his firm voice, her heart was relieved, and she lifted her eyes to heaven, and again murmured: "Father, I thank thee; thy will be done." As Captain Sands had predicted, in less than an hour the sea was comparatively smooth, and they were able to lower a boat. As the boat was lowered, a rush was made by some of the male passengers. "Stand back, gentlemen; stand back," said Captain Sands, in a firm, decided tone. '"Let the ladies get into the boat first." Twelve ladies were safely passed over the starboard side of the "Grapeshot" into the small boat, which hauled away from the side of the ship. Anothe'r, and another was lowered and filled; and the captain at last succeeded in. getting all safely into the boats-himself, with his wife and daughter, and Annie, being the last to leave the ship. As he took his seat at the helm, he remarked to his wife (who had preserved her firmness wonder- -fully through all these trying hours, and sought to keep up the hopes of the others): "Now, if we meet with no rough weather, we can live for a day or two in these boats. I think we are on the track of the New York and Liverpool packets. If I am right, we run a fair chance of being taken up by one of them." About an hour after taking to the boats, darkness fell upon the waters. The captain had allowed the men to row about     236         ANNIE WALLACE. a quarter of a mile from the burning ship, when he bade them lay upon their oars and steady the boat, while he gazed upon the destruction of his noble vessel. Now that those in the boat were removed from all danger from the devouring element, they could look with feelings of admira- tion, as well as regret, at the burning mass, as the flames crept up the spars and masts, forming pyramids of fire, standing up in boldest relief upon the dark horizon beyond, and showing every object in the glowing light, with perfect minuteness. An- nie looked out upon the scene and felt truly, as she had never felt before-a sense of her own weakness and utter dependence upon her Maker took possession of her. But soon the burning masts and timbers began to fall, and the fierce flames were quenched in the water on which they floated. "Oh! what a terrible sight!" exclaimed Amy. And a shud- der passed over her slight form, as she crept closer to her mother. "]It is a sublime sight, Amy," answered Mrs. Sands, " and one to be witnessed but once in a lifetime." "It is my own noble ship," murmured the captain, as a tear trickled down his weather-beaten cheek. "For nine long years have I sailed in her, and never dreamed that I should be standing in a small-boat to see her burn to the water's edge." "'Tis but a ship, my husband," remarked Mrs. Sands, "and it is not meet that you should mourn its fate. You cannot save it, and you should not murmur, though God has seen fit to destroy it." "Yes," replied he; " but I love every plank and bolt in her. There are associations connected with that ship, which it only can recall. "But you cannot help it-you cannot save her." "I know it, my dear wife; but look how patiently she meets her fate. Noble old ship! 'tis a hard fate for me and thee; for, in the materials that formed thee, is invested my all." The sea was illuminated by the flames of the burning ship for miles around, and those in the boats could, at times, see, with   THE BURNING SHP-HOURS OF PERIL.       237 distinct minuteness, every part of the ship, as the flames were now and then blown aside by frequent currents of air. But the spectacles was beyond description: we will leave the sight to the imagination of the reader, and not attempt to describe what words can neither name nor present to the mind The boats remained all night in sight of the ship, and, ere morning, saw it burn to the water's edge, as the moon ap- peared in the western horizon and cast its faint rays upon the scene. Captain Sands mourned over his vessel as a friend; but his good sense told him that it was useless; and, as the sea soon became as calm as could be desired, the captain finally induced the ladies to try to sleep. In the morning, as the sun's indistinct face appeared behind the heavy haze, the captain cast his eyes about him for the other boats, of which there were three besides the one under his own command; but, one only could he discern, and he ordered his men to pull alongside of that. A few moments brought them alongside the other boat, which they ascertained to be the one commanded by the second mate. "Holloa there! Mr. Bardwell!" sang out Captain Sands. "Ay, ay, sir!" answered the mate. "What has become of the other two boats?" inquired the captain. "By golly, I don't know," replied the mate. "I didn't miss them until this moment.'" "Well, the old 'Grapeshot' is gone," said the captain, with a sigh. "She is," replied the mate; " and I'll be darned, captain, if you will ever pace the deck of a better ship than was the old ' Grapeshot."' "That's so, Mr. Bardwell. But where did you last see the other boats?9 "On our larboard side, sir.  They may have pulled right ahead, and it is likely we will see them as soon as this haze clears -away."     238         ANNIE WALLACE. ' Where do you think we are, Mr. Bardwell?" inquired the captain. "Well, it seems strange how we got here; but I should think we were upon or near the track of the New York and Liverpool packets." "That is my opinion, sir," replied the captain. "It's lucky, if we are," observed the mate. "Very," replied the captain. "But come, IBardwell, I think we had better pull ahead and see if we can come up with the other boats." Accordingly, they rowed ahead for about half a mile, keeping in sight of each other, and a sharp look-out for the other boats. But neither of them could be seen. Presently the boat under the command of Bardwell came alongside of the captain's, and the mate cried: "Holloa there! captain! hadn't we better lay upon our oars until the haze rises? We may be pulling from them at every stroke." . "You are right," replied the captain. And he told his men to cease rowing and lay upon their oars again. It was an hour before the atmosphere was clear, so that they could obtain any great stretch of vision. Soon as the haze had disappeared, the parties in the boats cast their eyes anxiously about, in the hope of seeing their missing companions; but nowhere were they visible. During that whole day, the two boats pulled around in-different directions, with the expectation of meeting the lost boats, or falling in with some ship; but they were doomed to disappointment, and as night approached they began to despair. The captain had provided each of the boats with a portion of water and biscuits, sufficient to sustain them some days, and consequently they did not suffer hunger; but the prospect of another night on the ocean, in those frail boats, was anything but agreeable to the females. Annie bore up nobly. Her pleasant, sunny smile cheered Amy and her mother. Hope still radiated from her heart. The present danger which surrounded them, seemed to be a   SAIL HO!--THE RESCUE.        239 new one, disconnected with the previous day's horrors, and hope buoyed her up, and she was the least anxious of all in the boat. When others began to despair of meeting with a vessel to rescue them, she felt certain that a ship would appear before morning. When morning came, and none was in sight, she was quite as sure that it would appear before night. Even in that tiny boat, in the midst of the ocean, Annie's bright, cheerful temper sus- tained her in hopeful anticipations of the future. CHAPTER XXXVI. SAIL HO!- THE RESCUE. FOR three days Captain Sands and his companions floated in their small boats upon the bosom of the broad Atlantic. The weather, up to this time, had been clear and cloudless; an arch of pure cerulean had been their canopy since that fatal storm, which ended so disastrously to he "Grapeshot." But n ,upon the morning of the fourth day, dark, threatening mases of vapor lay along the western horizon, rising, slowly but surely, as it were, upon the bed of the -ocean; and Captain Sands saw, with the eye of a practiced seaman, they were threatened with another fierce tempest. Their water and provisions were nearly exhausted; and, as he looked in the direction of the dark, frowning cloud, his heart sank within him. He well knew, if a storm should overtake them in those frail boats, they were lost-nothing could save them--and he trembled for the fate of his loved ones. Straining, his eyes in every direction, in the faint hope that a friendly sail would heave in sight, he considered it prudent to conceal his apprehensions of a storm from his companions in misfortune, and hoped that the portentous cloud might pass away.     240        ANNIE WALLACE. Thus two hours dragged along, each moment seeming to be clogged with leaden wings. The cloud, which appeared but a speck when first his attention was drawn to it, was spreading itself out, like a dark mantle, over the heavens. His misery and dread were increased, now the rushing wind began to sweep past them, and the boat to rise and sink with the growing waves. The females pressed to his side with fear and anxiety in their looks. i; O, papa," cried Amy, "( we are going to have a storm." i' Maybe not, dear," replied the father. "O, but see that great, dark cloud rising in the west," she continued. "That is not a sure sign of a storm, my darling." "But you think it probable, papa; you need not be afraid to tell us; do not fear to tell me the worst, I am resigned, dear father, to the will of God." Captain Sands cast one more look around before he made a reply, in hopes of seeing some distant sail; but he was doomed to disappointment; nothing greeted his vision but the broad expanse of ocean between himself and the horizon; and, turning sorrowfully to his child, he responded: "I am glad that you feel thus fearless and resigned, my daughter. You are right; that cloud foretells a storm. There is a small chance that it my break up and clear away ere it reaches us; but it is not probable, and we should be prepared for the worst." "There is a ship!" suddenly exclaimed Annie Wallace, who had been steadily gazing through a pocket telescope towards the east, while the conversation we have related was transpiring between the father and daughter. "Where?" shouted the captain, springing to her side in an instant. "For God's sake, Miss Wallace, tell me where?" "There, there!" cried Annie, pointing over the larboard side of the boat. The captain looked eagerly in the direction Annie pointed, but a tremendous wave rolled up between him and the object so   SAIL HO --THE RESC UE.       241 eagerly sought; and, as they sunk in the trough, the vision passed from sight. "I can see nothing, Miss Wallace," said he, in a tone of keen disappointment. "Oh, I do!" cried Amy. "There, papa--see--oh!-it is com- ing this way. We are safe!-we are safe!" and the happy girl clapped her hands with joy. As their boat rose on the next wave, Captain Sands cast another searching glance towards the point indicated by Miss. Wallace, and he caught a glimpse of the outline of the masts and rigging of a ship, apparently bearing down towards them in a straight course. As soon as the captain made out the vessel, he drew a pistol and fired it, as a signal to the other boat, which was towing about at the distance of half a mile. The second mate pulled towards the captain's boat immediately upon hearing the signal; but, before arriving within- hailing dis- tance, they, too, made out the ship, and, as they came alongside, the second mate sang out: "Holloa, captain; that looks like a feller that intends giving us a lift. Do you think she sees us yet?" "I scarcely think she does as yet, Mr. Bardwell; but she soon will, if she keep her present course." At that moment they heard the boom of a cannon. "By golly, captain," cried the mate, "that old boy says you are mistaken about their not seeing us." "That does seem like a shout of encouragement; but we are not aboard of her yet." "I hope we soon will be; though, by gosh, captain, that cloud over your stern, there, looks kinder malignant." "Well, we are wasting time. It behooves us to pull towards that hull just showing itself yonder." The captain ordered his men to pull away. They obeyed with a hearty will, and soon their strong, regular strokes drove the. light boat through the water at a racing gait, leaving a broad trail of foam behind. It was evident that those on board of the ship saw the boats, and crowded on as much sail as possible, 21      242         ANNIE WALLACE. without risk, to reach them before the storm should arise and fill their boats. They soon approached so near, that Captain Sands and his companions could distinguish persons on the deck of the ship. Every moment the storm threatened to break upon them in all its fury, and nearly every sheet of canvas had been taken in upon the vessel that approached them. Those in the boats began to fear lest, after all their severe hardships for the last four days, they should perish almost within reach of succor; but they pulled vigorously-as men whose lives were in their hands. Nearer and nearer they approached, until they were within hailing distance; when some one sang out: "Pull away, my men, you are safe yet." "That is the voice of the first mate," exclaimed Mr. Bardwell, who was a few yards ahead of the captain. Ten minutes more, and they were alongside. The ladies were speedily transferred to the deck of the stranger. The last one to leave the boats was the captain; and, as he ascended the side of the vessel, he was greeted by the first mate of the "Grapeshot." "I am glad to see you safe, Hardlin," answered the captain, as he grasped the hand of the former in his own. At that moment the commander of the vessel approached, and was introduced to Captain Sands by the first mate. "What ship is this?" inquired Captain Sands, after replying to the salutation of the other. "The ' Wild Eagle,' sir, bound to New York." "That is fortunate for me," replied Captain Sands; and, turl- ing to the first mate, he continued: "And now tell me, Mr. Hardlin, how came you on board this vessel?" "Well, captain," replied Mr. Hardlin, "you missed us, of course, the morning after we left the burning ship?" "We did," replied Captain Sands; "and many an anxious thought did we have concerning your fate; I hardly dared hope we should see you again." "Well, captain, the night we left the ship, after an hour's row-   SAIL HO!-THE RESCUE.         243 ing, we caught a glimpse of a vessel, which appeared to be about two miles off. We pulled straight for it without waiting to notify you, for fear of losing sight of her; and we thought, as soon as we boarded her, we could search for you by the light of the burning ship. We rowed hard for four hours, by which time it was too dark to distinguish any object, or take any note of our bearings. We managed to keep our two boats together; and the men rested and watched, by turns, till morning, when we found that we had lost sight of both you and the strange ship. For two days we pulled round, despairing of ever being taken up, when, upon the third day, we espied the ' Wild Eagle,' and, after five hours' chase, we made out to reach her, and were taken on board." "We have been fortunate," observed Captain Sands, " and are under Jasting obligations to Captain Jenkins, his officers, and crew. But are all that were in the two boats safe?" "All safe," replied the mate; and as he spoke the passen- gers crowded about the captain, to offer greetings and congratula- tions. The three ladies--Mrs. Sands and her daughter, and Annie- were met, as they stepped upon the deck, by some of the rescued lady passengers, and conducted to the cabin of the "Wild Eagle." As they entered the door, Amy exclaimed: "Dear mamma, we are in a cabin once more!" "Yes, my dear," replied Mrs. Sands; ," therefore, let us return thanks to God for his mercy;" and she fell upon her knees, and silent aspirations ot praise and thanksgiving went up from the heart of the grateful wife and mother. The three ladies retired to obtain repose for their worn-out frames: both body and mind were exhausted with fatigue and excitement. As Annie lay down in her little state-room, her bosom throbbed with undefined emotions-she felt that she was safe from immediate peril; but her lonely and peculiar situation pressed heavily upon her mind. Her thoughts were wafted to the strange land she was approaching, where she would be landed friendless, and almost penniless. The future seemed vacant.     244        ANNIE WALLACE. Her anticipations were rather gloomy; and, exhausted and dis- pirited, Annie at last sank into a sound sleep, which continued for several hours, and which tended to recruit her, both mentally and physically. When she awakened, her energy was renewed, and she marked out for herself a course of action; and, after taking her breakfast, she left the cabin with lighter spirits, and, ascending to the deck, she seated herself upon a stool, near the lee-rail, and was soon absorbed in watching the bows of thee vessel as they went dashing through the water, throwing out the waves each side with their crests of foam, which glittered and sparkled in the morning sunshine like precious stones. "Ah!" thought Annie, as they would float past her and mingle with the dark ocean, ' so have the few bright moments that have dotted my existence flitted away, and the future looks dark and cheerless as the angry wave which swallows up the beautiful foam-crest." As these thoughts passed through Annie's mind, a sigh burst from her bosom, and raising her head, she observed two gentlemen standing at a little distance from her. One of them seemed heart and soul occupied with some subject, upon which he discoursed most eloquently; a careless observer might have supposed the other a profound listener-but not so was the fact. His gaze was riveted upon, Annie Wallace, with an expres- sion of intense but respectful admiration. As Annie turned towards them, the speaker laid his hand gently on the arm of the other, and said: "Now, what say you, Percy; have I not established my con- clusions?" "I will listen to your argument some other time, Grenville,' replied the other; and as he spoke he left his companion and walked to Annie's side. Bowing easily and gracefully, he accosted her in a tone and with a manner so kind and gentle, that Annie seemed to feel instinctively that she was in presence of a friend. He spoke feelingly of their sufferings and danger within the last few days, and before hardly she was aware, Annie found herself conversing with the familiarity of a friend, with one whose name   SAIL HO!-THE RESCUE.        245 she did not even know, although the gentleman seemed to be better informed, as he addressed her as Miss Wallace. The con- versation was insensibly prolonged as they glided from one topic to another, and Annie was surprised, upon looking at her watch, that it had been two hours since she had left the cabin. Rising hastily, she attempted a confused apology for sitting so long with a stranger, when the gentleman handed her a card, observ- ing: "We are not absolute strangers, Miss Wallace; we have met before. Although you probably do not remember, my memory has served me better--though there are few, I think, having once seen Miss Wallace, would forget." As he concluded speaking, he bowed gracefully and rejoined his companion. Annie looked at the card he had left in her hand, and read: "Percy Malcolm;" then turning her eyes towards the retreating form of the stranger, she had a dim recollection of having seen him, and heard his name, but could recall neither time nor place. She returned slowly and thoughtfully to the cabin; where she remained the rest of the day with Amy, meeting Mr. Malcolm and his friend only at the table. We will now introduce our new friends to the acquaintance of the reader. Percy Malcolm was a Scottish gentleman, descended from one of the younger branches of a noble Scottish family on the pater- nal side, but his mother was a Spanish lady, and from her he inherited his dark complexion and raven looks. His eyes were blue, but so dark that few would distinguish them from black; but there was a winning tenderness in their expression that threw an irresistible charm in a face and countenance not other- wise particularly handsome. Percy had been educated for the bar by a rich bachelor uncle, whose immense fortune he was supposed to be the sole heir to; but he never had practiced his profession, except in one instance for a friend who, in early youth, had saved him from drowning. That friend was Henry Monteith. -  ,*      CHAPTE XXXVII- NEW FRIENDS. PERCY MALCOLM had been betrothed, almost from infancy, to Margaret Lindsay-a near relative of his bachelor uncle--whose wealth she was to share equally, although, as stated before, this was not known to but few persons, as also was the case regarding the betrothal. The inclinations of the young people had never, of course, been consulted in this matter-the wishes of Mr. Mal- colm, Percy's uncle, having governed the whole affair-and, as often happens in cases of this kind, the young gentleman, although entertaining towards his affianced the most perfect friendship and respect, was averse to making her his wife. She was not the one his heart would have chosen, and, except for one circumstance, he would, long ago, have surrendered his share of his uncle's wealth to her, and declined the connection. That. one circumstance, that led him to resign himself to his fate, was, that the young lady, having been accustomed always to regard him as her future husband, was devotedly attached to him. Percy, from his earliest years, had evinced a, gentleness and kindness of disposition that were remarkable, and, as his years increased, a love of truth and unselfishness were marked traits in his character. He was now thirty years of age, and altogether a perfect gentleman. His goodness of heart gave a sym- plicity and gentleness to his whole character, which, to those who knew him, were sure to win their friendship and affec- tion. Very unlike this portrait was John Grenville, both in character and disposition, as will be seen presently; and yet a very strong   N EW FRIENDS.         247 attachment existed between these two young men-at least, on Grenville's part, as far as he was capable of feeling affection, self being the shrine at which he worshiped.  They had been playmates from their earliest remembrance-Percy being an only child, John had been to him as a brother. They had lived together in boyhood. Percy had shared his bed, and his purse, and everything else with his companion. At the age of fifteen, they had been separated-Percy to pursue his studies, and Grenville to prepare himself for the counting-house. They had not met again until a year previous to their introduction in the narrative, when the old attachment was renewed on the part of Percy with all the strength and freshness of former times; for he saw not the faults and imperfections of his companion--hts own purity of thought and purpose leading him to take it for granted that others were actuated by the same noble impulses as himself. Grenville was vain and selfish, as the future events of the tale swill show. ' For three days, after taking up the passengers of the "Grape- shot," the "Wild Eagle" encountered contrary winds. On the fourth day they spoke a Liverpool packet, and, in accordance with the wishes of the greater number of the passengers, Captain Jenkins tried to induce the commander of the packet to take them on board; but, having a large number of passengers on his own vessel, he refused to do so, consequently they were forced to proceed to New York with Captain Jenkins, where they arrived in four weeks after the burning of the "Grapeshot.' From the day that Annie first saw Mr. Malcolm until they landed, she received from him the most constant and delicate attentions, without being in the least forward or obtrusive in his manner, or by word or action offending the most rigid construction of propriety. Percy managed, as it were, by some magical influ-. ence, to anticipate her wishes. Towards the close of a beautiful day, they were sitting on the deck, conversing upon various topics, and viewing the great ocean spread out before them in the gorgeous sunset. The sea was calm, as if not a ripple ever ruffled its bright surface. Light     248        ANNIE WALLACE. feathery clouds floated in the blue arch above, radiant with the reflected hues of the setting sun. The grandeur and beauty of the scene seemed to find a sympathy in the quiet happiness which was taking possession of Annie's bosom. A calm and serene repose was succeeding to the wild tempest of feeling which filled her heart, at the cruel persecutions of her step- mother and Jamieson. She had begun to have a sense of security from a renewal of anything of the kind. Some moments had passed in silence, when Annie, looking up, suddenly addressed to Percy these words: "But you have never yet told me, Mr. Malcolm, where we first met?" Percy looked at her a moment, without answering, and then said, with a peculiar smile and expression: "Have you forgotten your friend who was 'killed in a duel,' Miss Wallace?" Annie looked at him with a puzzled expression, and answered: "I never had a friend killed in a duel, Mr. Malcolm." "Oh, I thought your friend, Henry Monteith, was shot by his friend, and so disappointed you of a most delightful scamper over the grass on horseback one bright morning." While Percy was saying these words, his eyes were fixed with a penetrating gaze upon Annie's face. At the mention of Mon- teith's name, the crimson blood suffused both cheek and brow for an instant, and then, receding, left her pale as ashes. Recover- ing herself, in a few moments, she smiled faintly, and replied: "I remember the report to which you allude; and," she added, suddenly, " you were Henry's messenger to inform me of the true state of affairs?" Percy bowed his head affirmatively, and, leaning over the rail, remained silent for some minutes, apparently absorbed in thought. After some little time, he turned again towards Annie. There were traces of strong emotion in his face. Resuming his seat, he said: "It is true, Miss Wallace; I was the bearer of a note to you on the morning after Monteith's accident. Have you no recol- lection of our second meeting?"   NEW FRIENDS.          249 "I have not," replied Annie. "Persecution and disappoint- ment have so followed my footsteps since then, there are few in- cidents for memory to dwell upon with any pleasure. But where did I meet you, Mr. Malcolm?" "There is one incident, Miss Wallace," replied Percy, "that I am very sure you have not forgotten, notwithstanding that your humble servant has not retained his place in the tableaux. You attended a wedding, some three months since-the bride was a runaway nun; the bridesmaid was Miss Wallace." Ere Percy had ceased speaking, a bright smile radiated the countenance of Miss Wallace, as she exclaimed, in an animated tone: "And the groomsman was Percy Malcolm. I have been very stupid; but, indeed, Mr. Malcolm, my heart was so steeped in sorrow, at that time, that there was little room for pleasant memo- ries. It is strange, however, that I should have so entirely for- gotten the face of a friend." "Perhaps it is not so strange, considering the circumstances," remarked Percy; "but I hope-at least, it is my most anxious wish-that you may rely upon me as a friend, and so regard me in the future." Annie looked up with a grateful smile-tears choked back the words she would have spoken; but, when Percy held out his hand to her, she placed her own in it with childlike confidence. They conversed sometime longer. Percy informed Annie that he had received letters from Monteith just before he sailed, and that he had written to inform him of their safe arrival in lEng- land; of the marriage of the viscount; and, also, of Annie's de- parture for the island of Penang. It was now nearly dark, and they left the deck and repaired to the saloon; and, shortly after, Annie retired to her state-roQm, to think over the conversation which ha'd just passed. her love for Monteith was again awakened to new life by a new im- pulse: he had inquired about her; he still thought of her; she was not banished from his remembrance. Annie retired t rest tranquil and happy.     250        ANNIE WALLACE. The foregoing interview had been a somewhat painful one to Percy Malcolm. He, too, retired by himself to meditate; but his feelings were rather sad than pleasing. He had been inter- ested by Annie's appearance the first time he saw her; when they had met again-upon the occasion of the viscount's mar- riage-her sad, gentle countenance, together with a knowledge of her history-which the earl had recounted to him-enlisted his feelings still more towards her. He more than suspected the nature of Monteith's feelings towards Annie, to whom he was at- tached by the strongest ties of friendship and gratitude; but, whether his friend's passion for Miss Wallace had been met with any requital, was a subject upon which he was totally ignorant when he met Annie on board the ship. There is no situation where the true character of a person like Annie would be so likely to unfold itself, as the one she was placed in now; separated, as it were, from the rest of the world, surrounded by the grand and sublime in nature, her native sim- plicity, truthfulness, purity of mind, and superior intelligence, were easily discerned by Percy in his daily intercourse with her; and he felt that, although he had visited many lands, and seen the women of different climes, that she was the one his heart would have chosen-to whom he could freely offer the rich trea- sure of his best affection, were there no obstacle in the way. These convictions had strengthened from day to day; still, his feelings and actions were guided by high principles and a well- disciplined mind, and, in his deportment towards her, there was nothing but the most delicate attentions of a warm friend. When he mentioned the name of Monteith to Annie, the sudden start and violent emotion she evinced, convinced him at once that his friend occupied the first place in her affections, and he nobly resolved to watch over her for him, and, as soon as he should -reach America, to transmit to Monteith such information as should be required tinder the circumstances. After ending his cogitations by this resolve, Percy retired to sleep the sleep of the 'upright in heart and pDre in conscience.    CHAPTER   XXXVIII. ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK. THERE had been an unobserved spectator to the interview be- tween Miss Wallace and Malcolm, to whom the scene had been anything but satisfactory and pleasing. From the first day that Malcolm had broke from him so abruptly, and entered into con- '-rsation with Annie, he had watched his friend's attentions to her with a suspicious eye; he had even upbraided Percy with "forgetting old friends for new," one afternoon, when le had been spending an hour or two, in a pleasant chat, while they were promenading the deck. Percy laughed, but made no reply-- not supposing Grenville was realy in earnest, and not suspecting how selfishly interested he was in his movements. On the day in question, he had stood at a little distance, hid- den from view by a part of the ship's rigging. He had heard no part of the conversation, but he had seen, by Annie's blushes and agitation, that they were conversing upon some subject intensely interesting to both; and, finally, Annie's little hand clasped by his friend, as he thought, in a lover's grasp. It is to be remembered that Grenville knew nothing of Annie's previous history, nor of her acquaintance with Monteith-nothing of Malcolm's engagement, which was strictly a secret-but he knew that Percy was reputed. heir to his uncle's immense wealth; that he had remained a bachelor till his thirty-first year without apparently being interesteds in the society of ladies at all. He had laid the flattering.. qnation to his soul, that so he would remain; and that, when he cameinto possession of his uncle's mag- nificent estates, with his usual liberality le would share with him,     252         ANNIE WALLACE. even to the half of his fortune. But here was a sudden inter- ruption to his day-dreams-a wife would sadly interfere with all these anticipations-and he, also, retired to meditate what was best to be done. He soon came to a conclusion: he was resolved what he would do-he would enter the lists for Miss TWallace himself; he would become her most ardent admirer and devoted slave; no doubt, with his powers of eloquence and superior ele- gance, he would soon withdraw her attention from plain Percy Malcolm; indeed, -John Grenville considered himself a very Adonis, whose charming person and manners no lady could resist. Satisfied with these conclusions, he also retired, to dream of success in his new-laid plans for rivaling his friend. Previous to this time, Grenville's acquaintance with Annie had been very slight; their intercourse had been confined to an occa- sional salutation when they met on deck, or some slight atten- tion, demanded Jby common courtesy, at table; for Grenville had avoided Annie, rather than sought her society. He could not conceal the pique he felt at his friend's constant attendance upon her, and desertion of himself. But now, this was to be laid aside. Her society was to be sought; his own powerful attractions were to be brought into requisition, and Annie was to be captivated, or taken captive rather, from the influence of his rival. Accord- ingly, the next day, when Annie made her appearance on deck, Grenville was the first to greet her. He fell easily into conver- sation, and retained his place by her side until she retired ag i to the cabin; and, at parting, offered to bring her a book for perusal, which he himself very much prized and admired. And so he went on, from day to day, seeking in every way to dazzle and amuse her by the fluency and elegance of his conversational powers, until Annie began to wonder how she could ever have thought " "Mr. Grenville such a dull gentleman ;" and Percy, also, to fear that his friend was becoming more interested in Miss Wallace than would comport with his future peace: and yet he did not feel at liberty to explain what he imagined to be the real state of the young lady's affections. But Grenville was happy in the idea   ARRIVAL IN NE W YORK.         253 that half his object was attained: there-iwere no more private con- versations between the two, and Miss Wallace evidently was pleased with his society; and-!so matters went on, until they landed in New York, one bright day in February. There had been a tremendous snow-storm the week previous to their arrival; and Broadway and its vicinity resounded with the music of merry sleighrbells, the- morning that Annie rode through that beautiful though crowded avenue for the first time. The scene was novel and exciting to her, and her heart yielded to the happy influences which seemed to surround her, and to fill the bosoms of the party she was with; and she forgot her re- grets for the singular providence which had 'brought her to -the shores of America. -Captain Sands, with his wife and daughter, and/ Annie, -took rooms at one of the principal hotels. Captain Sfands had set Annie's mind at rest with regard to pecuniary affairs, by telling her to give herself no trouble about the matter, as he should set it all right when he returned to England, which he should do in a short time. - Annie became, therefore, a member of his family, more especially, being entirely under his protection. Our two friends, Malcolm and Grenville, together with some other of the passengers, took rooms at the same house, which made their so- journ at this place very agreeable. Many pleasant parties were made up for sleigh-riding, and other excursions of pleasure; every-place that could afford interest -to a foreigner was visited--Mr.- Malcolm always offering to escort Annie, and Mr. Grenville almost invariably bearing them com- pany. Still, he found that in a hotel he could not so entirely succeed in his purpose to separate the two, or, at least, to pre- vent any meetings at which he was not :present, -as on board the ship, although he watched and followed'every movement of his friend for that purpose; for Annie would sometimes take a stroll in the afternoon or evening with Percy, and it began to be so plain to that gentleman that his friend was rather too insidiously attentive to -his movements, though the :motive was not at all ap- parent, that he began quietly to avoid having him always revolving 22     254         ANNIE WALLACE. in his orbit. But John very soon became restive and dissatisfied with this state of affairs, and only waited for a fitting occasion to express his dissatisfaction. One afternoon, Annie and Amy, accompanied by Mrs. Sands, started out upon that business which usually -occupies a lady's first attention upon her arrival in a city, after a long journey; and especially did these ladies, who had just arrived in the "Wild Eagle," find it necessary, after seeing the "Grapeshot" burn to the water's edge, with all their wardrobes on board. The whole morning was spent in going from store to store, making purchases. During the forenoon's adventures, Annie was highly entertained and gratified by the various objects of attraction. As they were driving rapidly round a corner, on their return to the hotel, she observed a youth making an effort apparently to attract her attention; but in a moment they whirled past him, and although Annie looked back from the window of the carriage, her glance had been too hurried to be able to determine if she had ever seen the person before; and in the after part of tho day, dress-makers and milliners drove the incident entirely from her mind. We would ask he reader to accompany us to a house that yet stands in Greenwich street. Its glory has long since departed, and, like many other noble old Knickerbocker mansions, it has been transformed, within the last few years, into a lager-bier saloon and German boarding-house; and every night its once respectable old walls echo shouts of boisterous mirth, and unin- telligible foreign gibberish. We would introduce the reader to the occupants of this house upon the evening of the same day that Annie Wallace and her friends had been " shopping." At the time the family, we make mention of, occupied the house, it was considered a first-class residence, and the abode of wealth. Sitting in a large easy-chair, upon the front balcony, was a fine-looking lady, although her countenance was not expressive of a very amiable disposition. At the time we present her to the reader she was reading a book, in the contents of which she   ARRIVAL IN NEW  YORK.       255 seemed deeply interested. Finally, the approaching darkness compelled her to lay it aside, though she still remained upon the balcony, apparently expecting some one. Presently some one called from below, and, leaning over the railing, she asked: "What is it?"Thomas. "Has any one been here, to-day, whom you little expected to see?" inquired a fine-looking youth, who bore a great resem- blance to the lady he addressed. "No, Thomas," replied the lady; " why do you ask?" "Wait a minute, and I will come up and explain myself," said the youth. And he hurried up the stairs, and a moment later stepped out upon the balcony, when his mother repeated her question. "What do you mean, Thomas, by asking if any one called - - here to-day?" "Who do you think I saw in the street this morning?" "How should I know, Thomas?" replied the mother, impa- tiently. "Well, just guess." "Thomas, if you have anything to tell me, you will please do so immediately, and forbear trifling." "Oh, if you are going to be cross about it, I will go seek father, and see if he can receive good news good-humoredly." "c Go, then," said the lady, in an angry tone. But Thomas had not reached the centre of the room, ere his mother's curiosity prevailed over her anger, and she recalled him to her side. "What do you wish of me, mother?" inquired Thomas. "I wish to know whom you saw in the street to-day?" "Will you banish that frown from your brow, and smile cheer- fully again, if I will tell you?" playfully answered the lad.  "Do tell me, Thomas' and cease irritating me." "But you should not allow yourself to get irritated, my dear mother," replied the provoking youth, assuming a dignified demeanor.     / 256        ANNIE WALLACE. "Thomas, you forget yourself-you'are carrying your jest too far." "Well, then, my dearest mother, I saw Annie Wallace in a carriage in Broadway to-day." "Who?" exclaimed his mother, starting up in surprise. "Annie Wallace," replied the young gentleman. "It is impossible!" cried Mrs. Barton--for she it was--" you are mistaken." "No, mother, I am not mistaken: I know Annie Wallace as well as I do you; and she it was that I saw." "Did you speak to her?" "I called to her, but she did not hear me; and the carriage whirled past so rapidly, that in a moment she was gone. I do not think she knew me." "If you were certain it was Annie, why did you not keep them in sight, and ascertain where she stopped?" "Because I could not--she was out of sight in an instant." "Then you cannot be sure it was Annie that you saw." "But, mother, I am positively sure," replied the youth. "Nonsense, Thomas; do not repeat that again. The idea of Annie being in America is absurd: you have mistaken some other person for her. Annie is not in America, and it is im- probable that she ever will be." "I do not know where the future will find her; but, if New York is in America, Annie Wallace is-my own eyes beheld her this morning in Broadway." "Do not contradict me again, Thomas," said Mrs. Barton, with increased asperity. "I see that you are rapidly acquiring the disrespectful manner towards your parents, that I perceive is so common to American youths." "Far be it from me, ever to be disrespectful to either of my parents; especially to you, dear mother. You have my heart's first and best affections. Still, I insist that Annie Wallace is in New York at this moment," said Thomas, earnestly. "You are a very foolish fellow to be so positive, when-it is so easy to be mistaken."   ARRIVAL IN NEW  YORK.       257 "But, mother, dear, if you had given me a chance, I would have explained to you, some time ago, why I am so certain. Just at the moment that I tried to attract Annie's attention, I heard some person near me cry out: ' Holloa there! Miss Wal- lace! where away there ' I turned to look at the individual who spoke, and saw a tall, powerful-looking man, in the dress of a seaman. I asked him if he knew that lady, and he answered, like a regular Yankee, 'Wal, yes, stranger, I reckon I do. She has all sails set, and is making eight knots an hour.' " "Perhaps you misunderstood the name," interposed Mrs. Barton, still unwilling to believe that Thomas had really seen Annie. "Oh, mother! how provoking you are! I do not think you would believe it was Annie, if you had seen her yourself." "Well, to tell the truth, I should have been loth to believe my own eyes. But did your Yankee friend say anything more con- cerning her?" "He did. I asked him to repeat her name to me, and he said, distinctly, 'Annie Wallace.' I further ascertained from him that she was on her way to the East Indies, in the 'Grapeshot,' com- manded by Captain Sands, and this man was second mate. On the thirteenth day out, the vessel was struck by lightning, took fire, and burned to the water's edge. The passengers and crew were three days tossed about on the ocean in small boats: on the fourth they were taken up by a passing vessel, and brought to New York." "Well, I suppose I must believe it," said Mrs. Barton, mus- ingly; " but it is strange to think of your meeting Annie Wallace in New York." We must find her out, mother, and bring her here to live," remarked Thomas. "Certainly we must!" answered the mother. "Annie may be in need of assistance. I wish you had followed her." "It was impossible: she was out of sight in a moment." Say- ing this, Thomas left the room.     258        ANNIE WALLACE. Dr. Barton, shortly after Annie had been taken from under his wife's charge, had sold his estates in Scotland, and emigrated to America, and was now successfully engaged in the wholesale drug business in New York. Thomas Barton acted as his father's clerk, and was on his way to the store, when he met Annie, as described by himself to his mother. A part of the next day was spent by him seeking Annie. He inquired at several hotels without success; and, finally, he went in search of the ship, in the hope of gaining some information. In this he was more successful, as the "Wild Eagle" was still in port. As he stepped upon the deck, he inquired for the captain. He is at yer side, yer honor," replied the person addressed- a stout, red-faced son of Erin. Thomas turned to the person designated, and inquired: "Was there a young lady named Wallace among the passen- gers rescued from the ' Grapeshot?'  There was," replied the captain. "Can you inform me where to find her?" inquired Thomas. ' No, sir; I cannot. I have not seen her since she left the vessel." Thomas started to return on shore, when the Irishman, who had heard his question, approached, and said: "An' is it the same little lady yer honor's spakin' of that's got the bright black eyes, and the purty black hair-and they call her Miss Wallace?" "Yes," answered Thomas, eagerly; " that is the lady. Do you know where she is?" "Troth, an' I know the lady like a book; and wasn't she afther givin' me the gould?" "But where can I find her?" said Thomas. "An' its her yer honor's afther?" "Yes, yes," reiterated Thomas, impatiently. "I will give you gold enough to spree for a week, if you will tell me without delay." ' An' it's yerself that's a ginerous gintleman." "But where is the lady?"   ARRIVAL IN NRW YORK.        259 "By the powers, then, I wish I could tell ye." "Fool! don't you know?" "Well, by the ghost of St. Pathrick, I swear I can't tell where ye'll find her." '"Then, why the d-1 didn't you tell me at once you did not know?" said Thomas, as he turned angrily away. When Thomas returned home, his mother inquired very anx- iously if he had discovered Annie. No, mother," replied the young man, despondingly. "Well, I thought you had started on a wild-goose chase." "I shall find her, yet," said Thomas. "What on earth possesses you to be so anxious to find Annie Wallace? I hope you are not smitten with a young lady two years older than yourself." "No, mother, I am not smitten; but suppose Annie is as you surmised, in need of our assistance, here in a strange land?" "It is strange to think of Annie Wallace needing our assist- ance; and I should willingly receive her home with us until she can receive supplies from home to enable her to return; but, Thomas, I do not wish you to neglect your business for the purpose of hunting for her." "Do not let that trouble you, mother," replied the young man, as he left the apartment. Mrs. Barton followed him with her eyes, and, as he passed from the room, she murmured: "Such a thing is not impossible. Thomas is a fine-looking youth. It would be an admirable match for him. Annie is heiress to immense wealth." And Mrs. Barton resolved, if Annie could be found, to take her to her house, in the hope thgt such a result might be brought about. Thus did the poor young lady seem constantly the object of some scheme, with money at the battom.     CHAPTER    XXXIX. MEETING WITH OLD FRIENDS. A DAY or two after the above events, Annie had just entered the house, from a walk, and removed her bonnet, when the par- lor-door opened, and the servant announced "Mr. Barton." "Why, Thomas Barton!" exclaimed Annie, as she rushed forward and took his extended hand. "How do you do, Annie?" said Thomas. "Oh, Thomas, when did you come to America? How long have you been here?" continued Annie, without answering his question with regard to her health. "We have been here nearly two years," replied Thomas. "And is your father and mother here, and all the rest?" "Yes, Annie; my father's store is but a few squares from this. Do you know I saw you, a few days ago, in a car- riage?" "Then it was you I saw on the corner of -- street, trying to speak to me." "It was," replied Thomas; "and I have sought diligently for you since; but come, resume your bonnet; mother is very anx- ious to see you." "But how did you find me now?" inquired Annie. "I was passing along as you entered the house, and I fol- lowed you in, being determined not to lose sight of you this time." "You were right," said Annie, as she prepared herself to go with Thomas to see his mother. It was early in the afternoon when Annie took the voung   MEETING WITH OLD FRIENDS.        261 man's arm and proceeded up Greenwich street. As they came' near the house, Annie perceived Mrs. Barton on the balcony. "There is your mother, Thomas." "Yes," answered Thomas; "that is her favorite seat." A few moments brought them to the house, and, as Mrs. Bar- ton came down to meet them, she exclaimed: "My dear, dear Annie!" and clasped her as fondly in her arms as if she had always loved her. At this moment Dr. Barton himself appeared. "Why, Annie!" he said, in surprise; and, catching her in his arms, continued: "I am rejoiced to see you, though I little expected that pleasure in New York." Mrs. Barton seized Annie's hand, and led her into the house. The younger children all came rushing through the hall to greet Annie-for she had been a favorite with them all-.and each claimed a kiss. At last they were all seated in the parlor, and Dr. Barton inquired about all that had happened since she had left their house and returned to Edinburgh. "And don't forget," said Thomas, "to tell us about your handsome friend, Henry Monteith." Annie blushed, but commenced a history of her adventures, by "flood and field," since parting with them, leaving out such parts of the narrative, relating to her step-mother's conduct, as she deemed prudent, in consideration of the friendship which existed between Mrs. Barton and that lady. Her story was listened to with absorbing interest, as they had never heard from her since she had left them. By the time she had finished, the tea-bell rang, and they all adjourned to the tea-room. Many questions were asked and answered, and the party enjoyed themselves until nine o'clock, when Annie rose to go. i     r"You must not go home to-night, Annie," said Mrs. Barton. "I cannot remain to-night," said Annie; "my friends will expect me to return; but I shall soon be with you again. O! it gives me such a home-like feeling to see you all." L   " "But," said Mrs. Barton, "I think it will be best you should     262        ANNIE WALLACE. come and take up your abode with us. Indeed, I cannot consent that you remain at a public hotel, when we are so near you." "I am with very kind friends," replied Annie, with a bright smile. "We have been associated amid trying scenes. I do not know what they will say to my leaving them." "They are mere strangers compared with us," said the doctor. "To us you are a dear friend, and I shall set up the claim of one. No, no, Annie, we shall not let you go, unless you promise to return with all your traps." Annie was affected by the hearty good-will and affection that was manifested by all, and she parted with a half promise that, after seeing her friends again, she would return. With Thomas to escort her, she was soon at her residence. Her spirits were light and joyous; friends were springing up around, and her path seemed to brighten with hope and love. When she returned, she found Mrs. Sands anxiously awaiting her; and the intelligence she had to communicate decided Annie to accept Mrs. Barton's invitation at once. Captain Sands had received letters, demanding his immediate presence in Boston. He had taken passage in one of the evening boats, delay being out of the question. Mrs. Sands and Amy had remained behind for Annie, and were to follow him next morning; but the discovery of old friends altered the aspect of affairs, and Annie determined not to go to Boston, but to place herself under Mrs. Barton's protection as soon as Mrs. Sands and Amy would depart. Accordingly, next morning, these ladies, with many kind wishes to Annie, bade her adieu, and embarked in the early boat, with the full expectation, on both sides, they should soon meet again; but these expectations were never realized-they never met more.   CHAPTER XL. ... T ITHE YANKEE LOVER. ye:-  As soon as her friends had gone, Annie commenced her pre- parations for removal. She sent a servant to Mr. Malcolm, to request his presence in her parlor, and in a few moments that gentleman made his appearance. Annie stated to him her unex- pected discovery of Mrs. Barton's family, of the hasty departure of Captain Sands and family, and of her own intention to take up her residence with Mrs. Barton. He heartily approved of this decision, and expressed himself the more pleased that she had found Dr. Barton's family in America, for the reason that he would himself be compelled to leave for the West, on business of an imperative nature-he was only waiting for some letters from Europe. He also kindly offered his services to assist in her transit, which were very thankfully accepted by Annie, and before noon she was once more under Dr. Barton's roof-tree, and a member of his family. The events of the last few hours had passed in such rapid succession, that Annie had not had time to think or realize the change; but changes had become so frequent in her life's history, for the past two years, that she had ceased to be surprised. One evening, during the course of the next week, when Thomas returned from the store he was accompanied by Mr. Bardwell. Mrs. Barton and Annie were seated by a window, from which they saw them enter the house. Thomas hastened up stairs to call Annie, when Mrs. Barton exclaimed: "What possessed you to bring such a queer-looking man home with you, Thomas?" "He is one of Annie's friends, mother, and a fine, intelligent     264        ANNIE WALLACE. fellow; though his manner of expressing himself is not so refined as it might be." "How did you happen to meet with him?" inquired Annie. "I met him in Broadway: he inquired if I had succeeded in finding you; I replied that you were at our house: he requested permission to come home with me and see you, and I have brought him." "I am glad that you have done so," replied Annie, and imme- diately went into the drawing-room to receive him. "i Good-evening, Mr. Bardwell," said Annie. "Good-evening, Miss Wallace," responded Mr. Bardwell, rising. "I am mighty glad that you came down to see me. How have you been since you arrived in New York?" "Very well, indeed," replied Annie. "Wal, how do you like us folks on this side the Atlantic? We don't frighten strangers with lord this and lord that; but, by golly, Miss Wallace, we've got a sort of people here that con- sider themselves lords. If they ain't dressed up so that a feller like me ain't good enough to speak to 'em." Annie expressed herself highly pleased with the people and the country, and the conversation proceeded some time, when Mr. Bardwell suddenly drew his chair a little closer to Annie, and sitting bolt-upright, with a hand on each knee, and looking in Annie's face with a sort of lackadaisical expression, said: "Wal, Miss Wallace, I came here with an object." "Well, explain yourself," said Annie, thinking, probably, that he wanted money. "Wal, I can't say but you give a feller a fair chance, anyhow," replied he, hitching his chair along a few inches. Annie began to feel a little embarrassed, and to wish his visit at an end. She had thought him an honest, upright man, and had wished to treat him kindly; but she began to think him too familiar in his mode of address, and she answered him some- what distantly: "How can I serve you, Mr. Bardwell?" "Wa14 Miss Wallace, I don't flatter myself that you love me,   THE YANKEE  LOVER.        265 neither can I swear that I love you; but I kind o' think that I could love you, and I would hope that you could love me." He stopped a moment, but intimated, by his manner, that he wished to say more. "Go on," said Annie, evidently amused, and determined to sit quietly, and hear him out. "Wal, the fact is, Miss Wallace, I want to wait upon you, and see, if arter we get a little better acquainted, we can't love each other," continued the Yankee, who had drawn his handkerchief from his pocket, and, holding by one corner with one hand, was twirling it into a twist with the other. Annie had to exert con- siderable self-control to prevent herself from laughing at the ludi- crous figure of this new lover; but she checked herself, and replied: "You have come too late, Mr. Bardwell; perhaps I might have loved you if my affections had not been engaged previous to meeting you." "Then my cake is dough," replied Bardwell, with a still more ludicrous expression; "but never mind, Miss Wallace, you have acted like a lady, and given a feller his dues, by saying you might have loved him if you had met him afore. I wish you had; but I won't trouble you again: one refusal is enough for a chap o' my grit. But I must be off," said he, rising. "Of course, you won't mention to that young Barton what I called for? I wish we had met afore; I would a been proud to shew you up to the gals in our town. But, good-evening. If you ever want a friend, Jerry Bard- well, of P----d, M-- ts, is at your service ;" and the disappoint- ed lover departed. As he stepped off the stoop, Annie looked after him, and murmured to herself: "There goes a man-a true gentleman-one whom I respect in spite of his rough ways." Later in the evening, Annie took a stroll with Thomas, and felt happier than for a long time; she felt herself among- friends. There was but one thought to mar the brightness of her feelings: it was of Peter, and, we must add, of Henry Monteith, who, with her brother, was ever before her mind. 23     CHAPTER     XLI. THE SAD PARTING. ON the day that Annie had left the hotel for Dr. Barton's roof, Mr. Grenville was absent from the city; he had left, the day previous, with a friend, to go on a shooting-excursion for a couple of days. When he returned, Percy merely mentioned that Cap- tain Sands had left for Boston with his family, and Grenville took it for granted that Annie had accompanied them. "Do they return soon?" inquired Grenville. "I am quite ignorant whether they intend to return at all," replied Malcolm. "Do you expect to visit Boston?" resumed he. "I have no such expectation at present-indeed, I expect to travel shortly in quite a different direction. As soon as I get some letters I am waiting for, I shall go to St. Louis," replied the other. "I will go with you," said Grenville, " if you desire my com- pany." "I shall be most happy if you will," said Percy. Grenville was satisfied. Annie had gone, and he had Percy all to himself again; and now the hope of sharing his future fortunes revived: there was no more watching the movements of his friend, but all was compliance and gentleness. It happened, one evening, that they attended, together, a meet- ing of a society formed for benevolent purposes. Well, John Grenville had the bump of love of approbation largely developed; he liked to be the cynosure of all eyes, and especially was he very fond of displaying his oratorical powers; so, at the close of   THE SAD PARTING.         267 the meeting, he went up to the president and secretary of the society, and offered to deliver a lecture for the benefit of the society, which offer was accepted. On leaving the place, Gren- ville requested Malcolm to write him a lecture on " kings and and kingcraft." Percy gave him a sort of half promise that he would do so, but appointed no, particular time for completing the same. This had occurred some time previous to Annie's remov- al to the Bartons', and John had been on the fidget ever since, and keeping a pretty close watch on Percy, whether or not he was progressing with the lecture. Now, that Annie was gone, he felt sure that he would redeem his promise without delay; but Percy was sad in spirit, his heart was heavy; he could hardly define his own sensations, but he did not feel in a mood to read or write, nor pursue any train of thought for five minutes to- gether; and, therefore, the lecture was not written. But he usually managed to separate himself from Grenville two or three hours each day, which hours he spent with Annie Wallace. Things had gone on in this way for about a week or ten days, when, one afternoon, as Grenville was passing up Greenwich street, he saw Percy Malcolm turn the angle of the square, just ahead, with Annie Wallace leaning on his arm. For a moment he stood transfixed with astonishment; the next he hastened on to overtake them; but, before he had attained his object, they ascended the stoop of Dr. Barton's house, and, entering, the door was closed without their having perceived Mr. Grenville. Stung with disappointment and chagrin, he retraced his steps to the hotel to await the return of his friend. About eight o'clock in the evening, Percy returned, and repaired immediately to his room to peruse some letters which had arrived in the afternoon; but, hardly was he seated for this purpose, when the door opened, and John Grenville entered, pale with suppressed wrath. Percy gave one glance at him, and then shut his eyes, as if inviting the approach of sleep. Grenville strode two or three times through the room like an angry tiger through his cage, and then down came the thunder and lightning. 'iI will not stand this any 'longer," quoth John; " you have insulted me too much. Ever     268        ANNIE WALLACE. since you have made acquaintance with Miss Wallace, you have treated me in a most contemptible manner; and, when I asked a favor of you, you would not grant it, but put off your time, dancing attendance upon the same young lady, after having led me to suppose that she had left, with her friends, for Boston. Thus you are forsaking old friends for new: you will do anything for anybody but me. And, in a short time, you are going off to St. Louis, and the lecture will be unwritten, and I will be dis- graced before all; and," said he, striking his hands upon the table, "'I swear, by everything sacred, I will not go to St. Louis with you unless you write me that lecture. I have made up my mind to it, and I shall keep my word." Percy stared at him in astonishment as he uttered this tornado of words-then quietly arose, and went down stairs into the reading-room, and commenced looking over the papers. The next forenoon he spent in perusing the letters over which he had been so suddenly interrupted the evening previous. Among them was one from his friend, Henry Monteith, stating his return to England, and the reception of a letter from him, giving an account of the "burning of the ' Grapeshot,' of the escape of the crew and passengers, among whom was Annie Wallace, and of her residence at present in America." He spoke freely of the interest he felt in that young lady, and stated his intention to proceed to America as soon as he should obtain leave, and would probably be on his way when this letter was received. A post- script added that he should certainly embark the next week. This letter decided Percy to leave very soon for St. Louis. "'I might as well quit the enchanted circle at once," mur- mured he to himself. He had not, by any means, indulged any hope that Annie would ever be anything to him, more than a friend, since the day he had mentioned Monteith's name to her; but he had found her society daily more and more fascinat- ing, and he had lingered near her partly on this account, and partly because, having written to Monteith immediately on his arrival in New York, he was expecting the answer, and thought best to wait for it. He made up his mind that he   THE SAD PARTING.          269 should see Annie in the afternoon, give her Monteith's let- ter, inform her of his own intended journey, and bid her fare- well. After dinner, he went up stairs to have his accustomed siesta, feeling more out of spirits than usual, on account of the scene with his friend John. He had just got to sleep, when Grenville entered the room and put a letter in his hand, requiring him to start immediately for St. Louis, without any delay. Malcolm, without saying a word, handed the letter to his friend. He glanced over the contents, and remained silent a few moments, then rising, he said: "Well, Percy, what I said last night was under the influence of passion. You know  I love you as my own brother, and I would go to the ends of the earth with you. I will go to St. Louis with you." After some further conversation, it was decided that Grenville should remain a week, and that the lecture should be written and transmitted to him. After arranging these matters, Percy pre- pared himself to go and see Miss Wallace, and inform her of his intended departure. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when Malcolm ascended the stoop of Dr. Barton's house. Annie was alone in the parlor when he entered. She was in one of her most happy moods, and sprang from her seat, and, with that child- like frankness and simplicity of manner, which even more than her grace and beauty had thrown a subtle spell around Percy's. heart, exclaimed: "O, I am so glad you have come." Percy took the hand she held out to him, and, as she stood before him in her artless purity and freshness, felt that it was, indeed, a sore trial to him to say farewell; but he strove to assume a gay tone, as he inquired: c' And why are you so glad, my dear young lady?" "O, there is a party of ladies and gentlemen who are going out to ride on horseback to-morrow, and Thomas has brought an invitation for me, and also one for you, to join the party. They are going to cross the river to Long Island, and will     270         ANNIE WALLACE. ride down to the sea-shore. Will it not be delightful," con. tinued Annie, with great animation. "O, I shall enjoy it so much!" "It will be very delightful, Miss Wallace," replied Percy, rather gravely; "and I hope your anticipations of enjoyment will be fully realized; but, I am sorry to say, that I shall not be able to be one of the party." ' But why can you not go with us, Mr. Malcolm?" said Annie, the gayety of her voice somewhat subdued. ".They are all strangers to me, except Thomas. Indeed, I wish you would postpone your engagement, and accept the invitation." "I am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your wishes, Miss Wallace," answered the gentleman; "but I have received a letter this afternoon which makes it a duty imperative to start immediately for the West. I shall leave for Philadelphia to-night. Thus you see," continued he, smiling, " it will be im- possible that I should accompany you to-morrow." "To-night!" said Annie. "So soon! and when do you re- turn?" "Perhaps not at all to this city. I may embark for Europe from some other port," replied he. There was a pause of some minutes after this announcement. Annie looked sorrowful. Percy was gazing upon her with an expression of unmingled tenderness, when, after a few moments, she raised her eyes to his face, and said: "You have taken me by surprise, Mr. Malcolm. I did not think of your leaving until-" she paused ; the color mounted to her brow; recovering herself, in a moment, she added: '"I am spoiled by your kind and generous treatment. Since I have known you, I have looked up to you as I would to my brother; and I had hoped that Peter would hear from me, and, perhaps, follow me here, and that you would see him; but, if you are leaving without an expectation of returning here, we may not meet again." During this speech, various emotions filled the breast of Percy Malcolm. He saw from her manner, and her frank   THE SAD PARTING.          271 avowal of esteem and gratitude towards himself for the attention he had paid her, that she had no suspicion of the nature of his feelings towards her. He was glad of this ; but her frankness and simplicity increased his admiration. Checking the rising emotion, he answered her, calmly: "Cheer up, Miss Wallace: if we do not meet again here, we shall probably do so in England, when I shall be most happy to see your brother, and share with him your sisterly regard. In the meantime, I trust you will soon be under the protection of one who will be more to you than brother or sister." Annie started at these words, and looked up inquiringly. Percy drew a letter from his pocket, and handed it to her, say- ing: 1"This letter I will leave for your perusal. I received it yes- terday. It will explain my meaning. And now, Miss Wallace," said he, rising, "I must bid you farewell." Annie rose and extended both hands to him, saying: "Stay until after tea, Mr. Malcolm; the doctor and Mrs. Bar- ton would like to see you; and-and-I cannot bear to see you go so suddenly." Percy took both her hands in his, and replied in a voice a little agitated: "I have lingered too long already, Miss Wallace, near you; and I would rather retain my present association of this parting interview than to mingle it with the mere commonplace courte- sies of life. It will have its place with my most treasured remembrances. Bear my parting adieus to your friends for me. Farewell!" As he finished speaking, he bore her hand to his lips for one moment. He turned from her--the door closed-and he was gone.     CHAPTER    XLII. THE UNEXPECTED AND JOYFUL MEETING. ANNIE stood for some moments after Percy had gone, just where he left her. At last, sinking back upon her seat, she leaned her head upon the back of the chair and gave way to a flood of tears. A presentiment seemed to force itself upon her mind that she would never see Mr. Malcolm again, and she felt sincere regret and sorrow at parting with him; but soon there was a reaction: she chided herself for giving way thus to her feelings, and rose from her seat to go and seek Mrs. Barton. As she did so, the letter Percy had given her dropped upon the floor. She had forgotten it. She stooped and picked it up, examining the direction, which she supposed would be to herself. But not so; it was directed to Percy Malcolm, and from Eng- land. Who could be the writer?  Why was it left for her perusal? These thoughts passed rapidly through her mind while she was opening the letter. She glanced her eye to the sub- scription, and read Henry Monteith's name. Her heart bounded with a quicker pulsation, and involuntarily she pressed the name to her lips. She sat down and ran her eye over the contents; but it was not until she had given it the second perusal that she fully comprehended its contents; then was her bosom filled with blissful emotions. One rapturous thought filled her mind: he was coming to America, nay-he was even now on his way--and he was coming for her. "Yes," she said to herself, "he loves me; but, O, if I only knew how long." As these thoughts took full possession of her mind, she forgot   THE UNEXPECTED AND JOYFUL MEETING.      273 all else beside-all past dangers and trials-present hopes and disappointments. The outward world had vanished, and her heart was so full of joy that, instead of seeking Mrs. Barton to inform her of Percy's departure, she felt inclined to retire by her- self, and silently brood over the exquisite happiness that filled her bosom. Annie, therefore, went from the parlor to her own room; and, when summoned to tea, excused herself from making her appear- ance that evening. When she appeared at breakfast next morn- ing, and announced Percy's departure, and gave his parting message to the family, great surprise was expressed at this sudden leave-taking, but more was felt at the radiant smiles that decked Annie's countenance, and the light of happiness that beamed from her eyes. Why, Annie," said Thomas, " you seem glad that Mr. Mal- colm has gone." Annie blushed, but answered without hesitation: "O, no; I am sorry-very sorry; and the more so, that he does not expect to return. I somehow feel as if I never should see him again." There was an air of such truthful simplicity about her, as she made this answer, that it instantly disarmed the suspicion which Mrs. Barton for the moment felt, that there had been a declara- tion, and, perhaps, engagement, between them; and the source of her evident happiness remained a mystery. The meal was finished in silence. Thomas felt piqued and irritated, he hardly knew why, and some of the former hardness and suspicion which had once possessed Mrs. Barton, begun again to settle in her heart towards Annie, and show itself slightly in her conduct towards her. But all this Annie did not perceive, or, if she did, it did not disturb her; she was too happy. She abandoned herself to the pleasurable anticipations of soon meet- ing her brother and Henry Monteith. Things went on in this way for about a week, when, one even- ing after tea, Thomas asked Annie if she would not enjoy a "stroll on the Battery."     274        ANNIE WALLACE. "O, of all things, most assuredly," replied Annie; and she hastened up stairs for her bonnet and scarf. She returned in a few moments, and they sauntered towards that beautiful place, which was then a prominent place of resort for promenading. It was just the hour of sunset as they entered the north gate. As they passed in, a gentleman, dressed in the British naval uni- form, stood leaning against the nearest tree, gazing earnestly at the different groups as they passed by. As Annie and young Barton approached, chatting carelessly, he turned at the sound of their voices; and, casting a quick glance at the young man, his eye wandered towards Annie, who, at that moment, had turned her head aside, so that he only caught sight of her profile. His face turned suddenly pale, and, moving quickly from the spot, he passed round to the other side of Annie, and looked in her face for a moment with a look of intense interest. Thomas had noticed the action, without perceiving the emotion that accom- panied it; and, therefore, was prepared to see nothing but the broad stare of the libertine; and, drawing Annie's arm within his own, he turned short round towards another 'path, determined, if possible, to prevent any further annoyance; but he found that he was not to be rid of the intruder so easily. For the spacq of an hour, while they strolled up and down the paths, he was ever near them. Sometimes he would wander on some distance be- yond, and place himself where they would pass close to him. Again, he would walk some length of time- within a few feet of them, never seeming to take any notice of the young man, but keeping his gaze steadily upon Annie, improving every oppor- tunity to look full in her face. Thomas grew more and more irritated, and, at last, in the true spirit of youthful chivalry, lhe determined to protect Annie from this man's insolent gaze, if he had to chastise him on the spot. Leading Annie to one of the benches placed along the river, he requested her to be seated a little while, and he would soon return. He immediately retraced his steps towards the individual who so pertinaciously dogged their footsteps. Approaching him hastily, he said, in a sharp angry tone:   THE UNEXPECTED AND JOYFUL MEETING.       o275 "Sir,/if you have any principle or feelings of a man of honor, you will cease your annoyance and intrusion, and keep at a greater distance." "Will you be good enough to tell me the name of the lady who bears your company?" answered the young officer, eagerly. Thomas was so confounded at the cool insolence of the reply, that, for a moment, he did not answer. Recovering himself, however, he exclaimed, in a voice choked with rage: "Scoundrel! how dare you ask me such a question? If you cross our path again I will knock you down!" The young man looked at Thomas a moment, as if he were astonished-puzzled; then, advancing a step towards him, he said, mildly: "Young man, you mistake me. Pray, will you allow me to ask your name?" Thomas drew back, a little confused. He began to feel as if youthful impetuosity had betrayed him into acting somewhat hastily, if not foolishly, and he answered the stranger a little sullenly: "You are so free asking names, perhaps you will not object to tell yours." "Certainly not," replied the stranger; "my name is Peter Wallace."     CHAPTER XLIIIl HAPPINESS. GREAT was Thomas Barton's astonishment, when Peter Wal- lace announced himself so suddenly. When he had had time to collect himself, he frankly apologized for his mistake. Extending his hand, he said: "I beg ten thousand pardons, Mr. Wallace, for my rudeness. The lady who is with me, is Annie Wallace, your sister; and I am Thomas Barton." "I suspected as much," replied Peter, with deep emotion; "if you will give me your address, and return home with her, I will meet you in half an hour. I could not make myself known to her in a place so public." Thomas took out a card and wrote his direction, and, handing it to Peter, he bowed, and left him without speaking, as he per- ceived the young man was excessively agitated. When he returned to where he had left Annie, he found her absorbed in admiration of the scene around her. After a few moments, he said: "Come, Annie, we will return home." "Oh, no, not yet," replied Annie; "I am enchanted with the scene before me; surely, the rich glow of this sunset will com- pare with Italian skies-and this beautiful bay, studded with ships from every sea-and this throng of bright, happy faces! Oh, I enjoy it all! I cannot go yet, Thomas; let us wait until the moon rises." "You have been to Italy, Annie," replied Thomas, and you ought to know if this American scenery will bear comparison It   HAPPINESS.           2" with the far-famed bay of Naples; travelers generally, I believe, who have seen both, will not admit it." "Oh, I will not pretend to dispute travelers, nor to be any judge in the matter," replied Annie; " but I am delighted to look upon these broad, pleasant waters that are spread out before me, and am very free to say that I was never so happy gazing upon the glorious beauty of the bay of Naples, as I am at this moment.'" "Well, come, Annie; let us go home," said Thomas, taking her hand; '" there is a sight will greet you in my father's house to-night that will yield you a greater happiness than either of these." Annie looked up wonderingly in the face of her companion, and saw that he was in earnest. She arose from her seat and pro- ' ceeded with him a few paces: a new train of thought had taken possession of her mind-it puzzled her to know what mysteri- ous source of information had reached Thomas; for she had not noticed the short colloquy which had passed between him and her brother. Turning to Thoias, therefore, she said: "Now don't tease me, Thomhs, but just tell me, like a good boy, what surprise you have prepared for me at home?" "Prepare yourself, then, to see a very dear friend," replied Thomas, gravely. Annie said no more: she thought of Henry Monteith; and, if it were he, she durst not trust herself to speak his name. It might be Peter; but she hardly dared to hope it, as she had received no intimation that he was coming. They were silent during the remainder of the walk, until they had reached the front of the house, when Thomas, catching a glimpse of Peter through the window, said: "Annie, your brother Peter is in the house." As these words met her ear, she left his side, and darted into the house with the quickness of thought, and in one moment the brother and sister were clasped in each other's arms. It was- a long time before either regained their self-possession; but Peter finally succeeded in calming his sister, and led her to 24     278        ANNIE WALLACE. a seat, when they found the room deserted by all but themselves. "Now, my dear little sister Annie," said he, "I want you to give me an account of all that has happened to you since we last parted at Kilmarnock." "O, Peter, I cannot, now-my heart is too full of joy; but I knew we should meet again. Tell me where you have been so long, and why I have never heard from you?" "Have you never heard from me?'9 asked Peter. "Not for three long years," replied Annie. Thus two long hours glided by, while Annie was rehearsing to her brother, the bitter trials and persecutions she had endured from her malignant step-mother, and her no less hateful brother: while Peter, on the other hand, recounted his visit to Penang, and discovery of their relations-his- trip to Italy, in search of her-his rencontre with her persecutor, etc. "But it is all over, Annie; sister, dear, you are under a sailor's protection." "And," hastily rejoined Annie, "4we shall never be parted again, shall we?' "Not unless," replied Peter, archly, " this gallant deliverer of yours, Monteith, should steal you away from me, which I am greatly inclined to think will be the case." Annie blushed, but reply was prevented by the entrance of the family at this moment. Peter informed them that he had been in New York two weeks; and that, during that time, he had made diligent search for his sister, without obtaining the least clue to her whereabouts. He had found her name on the books of the hotel where she had stopped on her arrival, but could get no fur- ther information. He had gone to the Battery that afternoon, with the faint hope that, amongst the many faces daily seen on that delightful promenade, he might chance to catch a glimpse of the lost one. Providence had smiled upon ,his hopes, and they had met. It was late when Peter returned to his hotel that night, satis- fied and happy. And Annie, sweet Annie, her heart was full of happiness, and happy anticipations. The next day after meeting her brother, she received a letter   HAPPINESS.           279 from Percy. It was the first news she had received of him since his sudden departure. His letter was interesting, but rather sad in its tone, and a shade of melancholy crossed her features on its perusal. It read as follows: "MY DEAR Mss WALLACE: "It is impossible to break up the ties that weave themselves around our hearts, without feeling sorely bruised in the process. Since I left New York, more than ever have I felt the sad vacuum which has accompanied all my wanderings through life: a mother's enduring affection I never knew; and where my heart would fain find a restincg-place, another-. But enough; I will not weary you with my low spirits, but turn to a more cheerful theme. My journey to this place was barren of incident, but de- lightful, notwithstanding, from its novelty, and the rich scenery which adorned our path. At Harrisburg, we took the canal- boat to the foot of the Alleghany mountains. It was a beautiful evening--beautiful, even, as the scenery through which we were gliding. There is something about the twilight hour which, to me, is always full of melancholy. Sadness seems to come with the moonlight and the falling dews; and, as I sat upon the deck, and gazed upon the earth and sky, and the broad bosom of the Susquehanna, bright with a thousand reflected fires, I thought of the land of my birth, and I thought, also, of our own Campbell's fair creation, ' Gertrude of Wyoming.' "(On Susquehanna's side, fair Wyoming,' etc. "t I durst not ask of those around, whether this was in reality the vale of Wyoming; for I thought, if they should answer 'No,' half the charms of the scene would vanish. The happy valley of Rasselas could not be more lovely. The hillsides are clothed, from their bases to their summits, with white-oak, chestnut, and other trees, with bright green leaves, variegated here and there with the darker verdure of the pine. Each day carried us through scenery no less beautiful than the former, though     280        ANNIE WALLACE. sometimes more varied in its character. Sometimes the canal and river would run through a narrow defile; so narrow, indeed, that the hills on one side laved their feet in the river, and on the other, in the waters of the canal. These defiles opened again into sweet little valleys, with their houses surrounded by green fields and patches of cultivated land. The scenery among the Alleghanies is too grand to be beau-  tiful, but not grand enough to be sublime. There was, indeed, a certain majesty about it; but it was the majesty of the sleep- ing lion-not the savage grandeur of the jungle monarch tread- ing his domain. It wanted the 'torrent fiercely glad,' the glaciers, and the 'eternal snows' of the Alps. 'Wherever man has left his impress behind him, there is interest for man,' says Lamartine; and this is what the Alleghanies want: the foot- steps of the red man are no longer to be traced upon their sides; the old associations are swallowed up in the darkness which shrouds the past, and the new have only, as it were, begun to cluster round them. "But you must be weary with my long letter. Answer it, my dear young lady, with one line to cheer me in my isolation, and it shall be preserved among my most treasured remem- brances. "Ever sincerely your friend, "PERCY MALCOLM." In spite of the bright future which seemed to lay before Annie, she could not but feel a little melancholy as she finished the perusal of this letter. Although she did not have the least suspicion of her own influence over Percy's feelings, she was convinced he was not happy, and had met some serious disap- pointment. In the afternoon, she equipped herself for a walk, partly to rid herself of a slight depression which still weighed upon her spirits, and, further, to perform a half-promise which she had made to Peter to meet him at his rooms and take a stroll in the afternoon-he being engaged in the forenoon with other matters. Having arrived at the hotel, which was in the lower   HAPPINESS.          281 part of Broadway, Annie inquired of a lisping negro at the door, if Mr. Wallace was in his room. "eth ma'm," answered the negro. "Is he alone?" inquired Annie. "Yeth, missy." "Be good enough to show me to his room." The negro led the way up the broad stairs, and, turning to the right, rapped at the door of one of the rooms, and, without waiting for a summons to enter, opened the door and thrust his head into the room. He then turned to Annie, and said : "Misther Walleth ith alone in thar." Annie walked in, and, closing the door quietly, looked round and saw a gentleman sitting with his back to her, apparently asleep, with his head leaning on the back of the chair. Suppos- ing it to be her brother of course, Annie stole silently up behind him, and, placing her hands over his eyes, she drew his head back and imprinted a kiss upon his forehead. The young man started up, and, turning round, Annie stood face to face with Henry Monteith! Cheek, neck, and brow were covered with a crimson dye, as the blood mounted to the temples of the young girl. Without uttering a word, she sank upon the chair from which the young man had risen, and covered her face with her hands. Henry stood for a few mdments regarding her, and then, taking her hands in his own, he said, in a low tone: "Annie." She raised her eyes to his face, without withdraw- ing her hands; and Henry read in that glance the pure affection which was to reward the constancy of his own devoted love, and to cheer his future path. Taking a seat beside her, a half-hour had passed away imperceptibly to both, when they were startled by a loud "Hem" close to them, and starting up, they discovered Peter standing behind them. "Well!" said Peter, with mock gravity, " you seem to be very pleasantly entertained, Miss Annie Wallace; but is this what you call maidenly propriety?"     282        ANNIE WALLACE. "This is Henry Monteith, Peter," replied Annie; " and this is my brother, Mr. Monteith." Peter stepped forward and grasped Henry's hand, and ex- claimed, with all the fervor of an honest, generous nature: "Ten thousand thanks to you! Monteith! and a million -to that! for your generous assistance to rescue this precious one from the grasp of a villain. Such acts are better appreciated than requited." Henry returned the warm pressure of Peter's hand, and drew Annie to him, while he answered: "To stand high in your esteem, Mr. Wallace, is the only requital I desire, added to the place I dare hope to hold in the heart of this beloved one." "Monteith, you are a noble fellow, and you may take the saucy baggage off my hands and welcome," replied Peter; "only," he added, mischievously, looking at his sister, "Annie told me yesterday that she never wished to be parted from her dear brother." Annie smiled, and gave a hand to each, without making any reply. The little party now resumed their seats, and Peter inquired of Monteith how he had found his way to his room. "I have been in the house several days, and this morning accidentally heard your name mentioned. I looked over the books, and suspected, from the entry, it was no other than your- self, and had come to your room to await your return." "But what brought you to America?" "His majesty's ship ' St. George.' My errand here was the same as your own-to seek your sister." After an hour spent in chatting, they left the hotel and pro- ceeded to Mrs. Barton's. Annie seated the gentlemen in the parlor, and went to call the lady. "Come," said she, " you will find an old friend in the parlor." When Mrs. Barton entered the room, she shook hands most cordially with Peter, and, turning round, her eyes suddenly rested on Henry Monteith, who saluted her respectfully. Mrs. Barton returned his salutation coldly,    HAPPINESS.           283 and, remarking to Annie, that " she was not aware there were any strangers with her," walked out of the room. "Ha! I see; she retains her old prejudices," remarked Mon- teith. "Yes," said Annie, "I fear it is true." "What reason has she to be prejudiced against you?" asked Peter. "I cannot tell," replied Monteith, rising; " but I will return to the hotel." "I will go with you," said Peter. "Neither of you shall go," interrupted Annie; "you shall stay and dine with us. The doctor will rejoice to see you, Henry." "I cannot, Annie, after Mrs. Barton's recent behavior,' replied Monteith. "And I," said Peter, " have an engagement with two ladies." "Two ladies " replied Annie, in surprise. "Who are they, pray?" "I will bring you to them to-morrow, and introduce you," replied the young man, gayly, and the two departed.     CHAPTER XLIV. THE STRANGER'S GRAVE. WHEN Malcolm left Annie on the afternoon that he bade her farewell, he returned to his hotel, sad and dispirited. He could not shake off the gloom that had taken possession of his mind. His passion for Annie had gathered strength from being so long pent up in his bosom, and now he felt a presentiment that he had parted from her forever-notwithstanding, the consciousness, that he had acted generously towards his friend, afforded him a sensation of peace and satisfaction, which the selfish and ignoble can never know, and which no disappointment or sorrow could deprive him of. Grenville felt restless and uneasy. He could not discover the position Percy held towards Annie. He felt almost certain an engagement had passed between them, and his work now was to prevent the fulfillment of any such engagement. Getting them separated was one step towards this end, and he turned within to rack his brain for some plan to accomplish his dark designs. Questioning Percy, he knew, would do no good, as he had tried this before, and found himself baffled. He con- cluded, therefore, to watch the course of events, and take advan- tage of any opportunity which might offer to further his designs. Malcolm left the next morning in the early train for the West. He hoped that new scenes, aided by time, that "soother of all woes," might soften the bitter pangs that now rent his feelings; but not so did he find it: the more he strove to banish Annie's image from his heart, the more was he haunted by the bright, sunny face, and soft, girlish tones, to which he had listened so often within the last few months.   THE STRANGER S GRAVE.        285. Love was not a mere passion with Percy Malcolm: it was the condition of his being. He had passed the first flush of youth when love is often a mere foolish delirium; and though weeks had passed since he left Annie, he found himself no nearer forgetting her than at first: it had become a living fire in his heart, destined to consume him. He felt that he "loved not wisely, but too well." Grenville joined him in St. Louis, in about ten days. He had called on Annie, hoping to gain some information, but was entire- ly disappointed; and he concluded to rejoin his friend at once, for the purpose of keeping a vigilant eye upon his movements. He fully determined in his heart, that, if a union were contem- plated, to leave no means untried, however base, to prevent it. The second day after his arrival, he came in one day and found his friend writing a letter. "Are you writing letters to Scotland, Percy?" inquired he. "No," answered Percy; "I am writing a letter to New York." "I did not know'you had correspondents in New York." "I have but one," quietly answered Percy, and resumed his writing. Alas! for poor John; this put him on the fidgets. Then he was writing to Miss Wallace. What might he not say to her. If he could only see the letter; and for this he watched and waited, and finally saw Percy fold his letter, put it in his pocket, and leave the house to deposit it in the post-office; and so it hap- pened again and again, until, in the course of a few weeks, Percy was taken ill with the bilious fever of the climate. For two weeks he struggled with disease, when he rallied, and, for a few days, anticipated a speedy recovery; but a slender constitution, and, added to this, the continual struggle of his feelings for the last few months, counteracted every effort of medical skill, and, in two months after Percy Malcolm entered St. Louis, he was buried in the " stranger's grave."     CHAPTER XLV. HAPPY HOURS. WHEN, a day or two subsequent to Monteith's first appearance at her house, Mrs. Barton was informed of the engagement between Annie and Monteith, her countenance wore an expression of blank astonishment. She saw in a moment that all hope for Thomas was gone; but she resolved, in spite of her disappoint- ment, to appear pleased, and she accordingly congratulated them with much cordiality, and relaxed somewhat of the hauteur of her demeanor towards Monteith. Peter, in the meantime, had made Annie acquainted with the "two ladies," of whom mention was made in the previous chapter. They proved to be Madame Corrilla and her daughter. When Peter Wallace left England, he felt sad and disheartened. His hope of finding his sister was almost extinguished. He stood in the stern of the vessel, looking upon the dim shores as they fast receded from his sight, lost in thought, when he was aroused by female voices. Turning round, he recognized Madame Corrilla and Emily. Mutual expressions of surprise followed, when, on Peter's inquiring the reason for going to America, she replied: "Mere curiosity. I have long wished to see the Western World, and I have improved the present opportunity for doing so. But is your sister on board with you?" "She is not," replied Peter; and he related to her his various disappointments, and his present intention' of seeking her. During the voyage to New York, which was prosperous and rapid, the favorable impressions already made upon the heart of   HAPPY HOURS.          287 the young sailor by the fair Emily, very much deepened, and he resolved that, when he succeeded in finding Annie, he would seek her for his bride. When they returned to the carriage, after making a call, Peter inquired of Annie how she "liked her new acquaint- ances." "I think," said Annie, " that Emily Corrilla is one of the love- liest creatures I ever saw--she is perfectly beautiful." "I am rejoiced that you like her, Annie." "Why?" inquired Annie. "Because I love her," frankly replied Peter, "I and intend to make her your sister, if she will consent." "And I am sure she will consent," warmly responded the young lady, " and I know I shall love her. I think you have made a good choice, my dear brother." "Thank you, Annie; but I have not told you all: Emily is a Catholic." Annie looked sorrowful at this information; but she answered, in a few moments: "If she be a bigoted Catholic, Peter, and under the influence of the priests, do not make her your wife, even though giving her up be a great sacrifice. I know something of them. But, if her mind be not under priestly influence, I think, dear brother, you may be happy, and we may win her to our own faith." "You have given me great encouragement, Annie, and I am glad your views are so near my own." At this moment the carriage stopped. Peter handed Annie into the house, kissed her fondly, as he bade her good-by, and, reentering the carriage, returned to Madame Corrilla's lodgings. When he left the house again, Peter Wallace was Emily Corrilla's affianced husband. After much consultation and many conclusions, it was de- cided, according to Annie's earnest wish, that the whole party should sail for Penang as soon as a vessel bound for the lEast Indies should sail, and that the marriages should be deferred until their arrival at that place.      28S         ANNIE WALLACE. It was six weeks before they succeeded in securing a passage. During this time Annie received two more letters from Percy; and then came a letter in a strange hand, with the sorrowful news of his untimely fate in a strange land. Annie had shown all her letters to Monteith, and related all the circumstances of her meeting with him, and his kindness and friendship to her up to the time of his departure. Henry half suspected the state of Percy's feelings, and wrote to him; but his letter never arrived at its destination. They mourned his death, as a dear friend, and felt the more anxious to hasten their departure. The day before the one on which they were to sail, Annie and Henry had been to bid farewell to some friends, when, on her return to Mrs. Barton's, she was informed that a gentleman was waiting to see her. Leaving Henry on the balcony with Dr. Barton, she entered the parlor, and was both surprised and pleased to see Mr. Grenville, who arose and bowed, at her entrance. Annie returned his salutation with the greatest cordiality, remarking that it was most fortunate his call was made before they had left. "Is it your purpose to return to Scotland, Miss Wallace?" inquired Grenville. "Probably, at some time," replied Annie; "but tell me of Percy-Mr. Malcolm-were you with him when he died?" "I was," replied Grenville. "You are probably aware that his uncle died in Scotland at about the same time?" As Grenville said these words he gave Annie a searching look. "Yes," replied Annie, with some hesitation in her manner, for Monteith had told her; " a gentleman recently from Scotland in- formed me of it." It must be borne in mind that Grenville was altogether misled as regarded Annie's position towards Percy. He was confirmed in the belief that an engagement had been formed between them before his departure for the West-that the letters were written in this spirit. Very unexpectedly to himself, Malcolm and his uncle had both died, and he formed the base design that, if he could gain possession of those letters, he would proceed to Scot-   HAPPY HOURS.          289 land with a female whom he had met in his wanderings, and won to his purposes by a promise of marriage. This person was to personate Percy's widow, and claim the estate for her son, a child about six months old-the boy in reality belonging to her sister--who was persuaded to give the child for this purpose. This being his plan, it was important to induce Annie to give into his possession the letters which Percy had written to her; and this was the object of his visit on this day, which he made known by abruptly saying: "' Miss Wallace, I have come to demand of you the letters written to you by Percy Malcolm during his absence; and I sup- pose you will not hesitate to give them to me ,?" Annie stared at him in perfect astonishment at these words, and at first hardly knew what reply to make to such a strange request, so strangely made. Recovering somewhat, she an- swered: ".Demand my letters, Mr. Grenville! I don't understand you. What right have you to Percy Malcolm's letters?" "I suppose that you know Malcolm's writing, and will not dispute my right, when I show you, in his own handwriting, that his effects-all, everything-were given to me?" Annie's countenance changed from surprise to cold contempt, as she haughtily answered: "Mr. Malcolm may have bequeathed to you his whole estate, for ought I know, but these letters do not comprise a part of it, as they are mine. I choose to keep them." "Ha," replied he, sneeringly, " perhaps--but I could not sup- pose Miss Wallace would have any mercenary views in retaining them." "Mercenary views? Mr. Grenville, I must confess that I am entirely at a loss to understand you." "O, of course not! I supposed that Miss Wallace would be entirely above anything of the kind," he replied. "Mr. Grenville," said Annie, after a pause, " your language is more and more incomprehensible to me; and I cannot divine what your motive can be in wishing for these letters." 25     290        ANNIE WALLACE. "O, merely for the pleasure of reading them," said he: "Percy was an interesting writer, and, as I consider them mine by gift, I would wish to possess them for their literary merits." At this moment Monteith entered the room. As Dr. Barton had been called away immediately, he had been sitting alone on the balcony, and had heard every word of the above conversation. He knew something of Grenville's antecedents, and that he had been disposed to take advantage of Percy's generous disposition; and he felt certain that some selfish, sordid motive was at the bottom of this present movement, and he concluded to come into the room to relieve Annie from his presence and impertinent demands. As he entered, Annie introduced them: and Henry, turning to her, said, in a low tone: "Go to Mrs. Barton, Annie. I will deal with this fellow." Annie left the room immediately. When she had gone Henry turned to Grenville and inquired: "Did Percy know, before he died, of his uncle's death, Mr. Grenville?" "I No, sir," replied Grenville, " the letters containing the news did ndt arrive until after his death. His widow is about to sail for Scotland and claim the estate to which Percy fell heir by his uncle's death, for their child, a boy about six months old at pre- sent." "His widow!" replied Henry, in utter astonishment and dis- gust, for he saw at once through the whole scheme; "and how long has Percy been married, sir?" "He was married privately previous to leaving England. His wife preceded him here, and he joined her at St. Louis about three months since." Monteith did not believe one word of this tale; but he did not think it wise to contradict it. He knew that if it were a plan laid to get his uncle's fortune, that it would utterly fail, as that for- tune was already disposed of. He answered, therefore, very cooly: "My dear sir, it is very unfortunate for Percy's widow and   HAPPY  HOURS.          2191 child if they have no other expectations than from his heirship to his uncle's estate, as, from the condition of his uncle's will, that very marriage cuts him off from any claim to it." "Explain, sir, if you please?" replied Grenville, evidently dis- turbed. 6"Well," replied Monteith, " there was a young lady, niece to the old man, to whom Percy had been betrothed from childhood, and who was coheiress with him, if they married. In the event of his marrying another, or of his death, the whole estate devolved upon the young lady." Mortification, rage, disappointment, and malice were alternately depicted on the face of Grenville. He could not doubt for a moment that Monteith had told him the truth, for he knew him to be a man altogether above deception. He saw that he had exposed himself to the suspicion of acting falsely, while there was not the smallest chance of any profit to himself. He inwardly cursed himself for his folly and short-sightedness. Perceiving that it was necessary to conceal his shame somewhat, and make some reply, he rose and thanked Monteith for his information, on behalf of the widow, and requested him to bear his respects and good wishes to Miss Wallace, as his "engagements would not permit longer stay." "But, perhaps, Miss Annie has gone to procure the letters you were inquiring for," said Henry, with a satirical smile. "I think," replied he, " it will be as well for Miss Wallace to burn those letters, as whatever pretensions Mr. Malcolm may have made to win Miss Wallace's affection were hypocritical. It was to restore them to one who had a better right that I wished to gain possession of them." "Mr. Grenville," replied Henry, "you are a villain of the deepest dye; and, if you were not beneath contempt, I would punish you on the spot. Percy Malcolm was not a hypocrite, as you well know. He never sought to gain Miss Wallace's affec- tions, for the reason that he knew they were already bestowed upon another; and you have been playing the hypocrite, without the expectation of being so suddenly exposed."     292        ANNIE WALLACE. During this speech Grenville trembled with suppressed wrath; but, seeing that his wicked plans were all frustrated, and his own baseness was exposed, he deemed it best to dissemble, and he answered Henry in a subdued tone: "I am sorry, Mr. Monteith, that you have so mistaken me. We may meet when passion has less sway over your feelings, and you will be more reasonable. Till then, adieu!"So saying, he bowed and left the house. CHAPTER    XLVI, FINAL VOYAGE TO PENANG. IT is a lovely night at sea. The moon pursues her way across the heavens in quiet majesty. The thin, fleecy clouds through which it passes are illumined by its mellow light for a moment, and then fall back in her wake, and appear motionless to mortal eyes. The surface of the ocean is undisturbed by aught but the gentle zephyr, that slightly ripples the calm surface of the mighty waters.                              I In the distance, alone upon the trackless ocean, glides a noble ship; all sails are set to catch every breath of air. Its corn- mander is ambitious to make a quick voyage to the destined port, and the calm beauty of the evening, which elicits bursts of admi- ration from his passengers, only calls forth complaints from him. Seated on deck, near the aft-railing, is Henry Monteith and his affianced wife. They had been contemplating the scene before them, for some time, in silence, when suddenly Monteith said: "( Annie, darling, what are you thinking upon so intently?" Annie looked up brightly, and a sweet smile played about her lips as she replied: "I was thinking of the past and the future, Henry."   FINAL VOYAGE TO PENANG.        293 "First, then, dearest, telPme what your thoughts are of the past?" "I was thinking, first, of my pleasant sojourn in the town cf G-----; of our first meeting and parting; and was tracing in my mind each scene, even up to my departure from England, and parting with Julia. Yet, painful as some of these memories are, I would not have them effaced." "And now tell me,",said Henry, tenderly, and drawing her closer to him, "my sweet lassie, what were your thoughts in re- gard to the future?" Annie turned to him with a glad, happy smile, and said, un- hesitatingly--for, though shy of caresses, she was perfectly frank in her expressions of affection: "I was thinking, Henry, of the many, many happy hours we shall pass together; that even your absences will be made pleas- ant by the joy of your returns." Henry took both her hands, and silently bent over and im- printed a kiss upon her brow, with such manly tenderness that she forgave the kiss. Presently he said, with evident emotion: -"Always welcome my returns, darling, with that happy, smiling face, and there can be no charm added to my existence." "Do not forget that I am Annie Wallace, and not an angel, and that I have many faults and imperfections to try your patience and cloud your pathway." "I  will always strive to remember," replied Henry, " that whatever your faults may be, you have a heart, honest and true, whose affection throws golden sunshine round my pathway, and reflects its brightness even upon the clouds." "Thank you, Henry," said Annie, as every feature beamed with the happiness his words had caused. "Heaven grant that I may be enabled, by my daily actions, to retain your esteem and affection." f At this moment they were joined by Peter and Emily. "What a   glorious night!" exclaimed Peter: "this was not made for slumber."     294         ANNIE WALLACE. "No, nor for sailing either," said Captain Fletcher, who joined them at this moment. "But you seem to be enjoying your-      l selves." "Yes," answered Peter; "I suppose that we enjoy this calm more than you do." "I don't enjoy it at all. I would rather it would blow a hur- ricane than not blow at all." "That is characteristic of the American people, I think," remarked Monteith, smiling. "It's characteristic of me, whether it be of my countrymen or not," replied the captain, as he walked away. Just at that moment they were startled by several wild screams which followed each other in quick succession. They rose from their seats involuntarily, while Emily clasped her hands and shuddered with agony, as she exclaimed: "Oh, that is my mother!"  The party on deck stood still for a moment, when the screams were repeated. They evidently proceeded from the cabin; and Peter, followed by Monteith, made a rush towards the sounds;    ' but, just as they reached the hatchway, and were about descend-  ! ing, they met Madame Corrilla.                   i "What is the matter, madame?" cried Peter, seizing hold of  a her, as she attempted to elude him.            .:! "Avaunt, thou wild serpent!" screamed madame, as she       i dashed Peter away from her with such force that he fell against the side of the ship, and rushed towards the gunwale of the vessel,  evidently with the intention of springing overboard. "Save her! oh, save her!" cried Emily, in terror. The captain, coming up at this moment, the three gentlemen succeeded in securing her. "Keep her a moment," said Emily, as she hurried down to her state-room. In a moment she appeared, with two deli- cately wrought wrist-manacles. "Put these on her," said she, while her countenance expressed intense pain. "What! on your mother?" said the captain.   FINAL VOYAGE TO PENANG.        295 "' Yes, yes!" said the poor girl: s" she will be in this state for a week. She procured these irons herself, and directed me to use them whenever she should be attacked." "Then she is subject to these attacks?" said the captain, while arranging the manacles. "Ever since my father's death," replied Emily; " but her intervals of reason grow longer: this is the first attack she has had in more than a year." The poor lady was taken below deck and locked in a state- room, where she gave vent to her frantic cries all night, to the /terror and discomfort of the other passengers; but in the morn- ing she became calmer. It was ten days before Madame Corrilla became fully restored to her usual state of mind and health. The attack had contin- ued so long that Emily had almost despaired of her recovery; when, therefore, the poor young lady, upon entering her room, heard her mother speak in her usual tone, she burst into a flood of tears i but her heart was filled with thankfulness, as she re- moved the irons from  her wrists and led her on deck to inhale the fresh air. No allusion was made to madame concerning her illness and recent state of mind, and everything went on as usual. They had now been more than three months at sea, and began to wish for land. They had become tired of the monotony of the same blue arch above, and wide expanse of water beneath, and even the beautiful evenings had ceased to be a source of enjoy- ment, so heartily weary were they of their tedious voyage. "Oh, how I wish we were in sight of land once more," said Annie one day to Henry. - "I long to see the green hills. Here is sky and water-nothing   else to gaze upon but your loved countenance, and I am almost tired of looking at that," said she, laughingly. --  1"You are probably wishing for one of those absences that is to bring you so much pleasure by the returns," replied Henry, mischievously. As the captain passed them at this moment, Monteith inquired when he thought they would arrive at their destined port.     296        ANNIE WALLACE. "Not for a month yet," replied the captain; ' and, perhaps, two." "By Jupiter!" exclaimed Peter, "I would give half my fortune to be taking a tiffin in Tom Aston's back-room at this moment." It was a long month to the passengers of the "Sea-bird"; but, at last, one bright morning, they were roused by the joyful sound of--"Land ahead!"  Peter, Monteith, and the ladies all hurried to the deck, and, sure enough, a dim line of shore presented itself in the distance, and the captain promised that, before the evening, he would put our party ashore on the island of Penang. Late in the afternoon, as they neared the island, the sun was going down on land and sea; the day was declining in extreme beauty on the shore; the groves of palm-trees and spice planta- tions spread out upon the plains, between the mountains and the sea; beyond these, gigantic hills towering one above another in grand majesty; in the foreground the rocks darkly breasting the waves. As all these appeared in view, they presented to Annie such a scene of wild and singular magnificence as excited the most intense admiration in her bosom, used even as she was to the wild, rugged scenery of Scotland. As the vessel dropped anchor, Peter could discern, among the many forms who crowded the beach, watching their approach, Philip and his venerable grand-parent. They were soon sur- rounded by a swarm of Chinamen, in their little triangular boats, ready-to land them on the quay. Our party were soon seated in one of these, and, in a few moments, Annie was clasped in the arms of her new-found relatives, who, with feelings of the most intense pleasure and satisfaction, led the way to the grand old house described in a former chapter. A few minutes brought them to the house, and, as they entered, Jose Marcella caught Annie in his arms and kissed her over and over again, and then led her to Noria, her elder sister. The stranger sisters rushed into each other's arms. They   FINAL VOYAGE TO PENANG.        297 were sisters-that was enough-it required nothing more to call up that fountain of sisterly affection which was welling up in both their hearts; it seemed as if they had only been parted awhile and had met again. While the sisters were engaged in embraces and mutual expressions of affection, Peter introduced Henry' and made known his relations towards Annie. Hands were clasped, congratulations offered, and it was an hour before any kind of serenity or quiet was restored, and they became tired of asking and answering questions. The gentlemen then withdrew to enjoy their Havanas, while the ladies sat upon the veranda, still engaged in conversation. Annie was bewildered with happiness; such a flood of joy was poured into her heart, at being at last cradled in the arms of affection, and removed from all danger of persecution from her former enemies, that she could hardly trust to its reality, she sat arm-and-arm with her sister, delighted with the novelty of everything. Thus the time was spent until the evening meal was announced. As they gathered around the board, Senor Jos6 Marcella entered from the library, bearing some letters in his hand; -these, he said, had arrived some two weeks previous, directed one to Peter, the other to Annie; and the reception of these letters had led to the expectation of their arrival; and thus they had repaired to the beach when a vessel first hove in sight. The opening of the letters was postponed until after tea. They proved to be from Mr. Montgomery, and announced the death of Mrs. Wallace, and, of course, Annie, and Peter's accession to the estate, and urging the necessity of their speedy return. Mrs. Wallace, the letters stated, had died suddenly, very soon after her return from Italy. Disappointment and shame had worked upon her nervous system, together with the fatigue of her hurried journey. This news cast a new aspect upon the affairs of the orphans, and a speedy return to Scotland seemed absolutely necessary. The time for retiring at last arrived, and the Indian servants led each guest to their sleeping-apartments. Annie fell asleep as     298        ANNIE WALLACE. soon as her head touched the pillow, being exhausted by the ex- citing events of the day. CHAPTER XLVII, THE MARRIAGE. IT was a bright, beautiful morning, about a month after Annie's arrival in Penang. She had become accustomed to that which was at first excessively annoying--the incessant attentions of the Indian servants. Every want was anticipated: when she awoke, an ayah stood ready to wash her feet, dress her hair, pare her nails, and put on her dress; when she lolled on a couch, another would wave a yak's tail over her head, in gentle and cooling undulations, to keep off the mosquitoes , when she made her ap- pearance in the great hall, the peadah,* with a profound salaam, presented himself, to hear her commands; when she chose to walk, one or more of these servitors accompanied her, to carry the chattat over her head, to protect it from the sunbeams. But she had begun to fall quietly into these Indian habits, and feel quite at home. She had visited every place of interest; climbed to the tops of the hills, and breathed their bracing air, and viewed, from their lofty peaks, the ocean stretching out all around her; she had seen the temples and pagodas; and now it is upon the morning of her bridal day that we again introduce her to the reader. She was sitting on the back veranda with her sister Noria. At five o'clock in the afternoon, she was to become the wife of Henry Monteith. Annie had been sitting some time, engaged in conversation with Noria. These stranger sisters had found each other all "House-runner.   t Umbrella.   THE MARRIAGE.          299 they could wish; but Noria was disappointed at having so soon to surrender her sister to the exclusive love of a husband. "My dearest Annie," said she, speaking sadly, "it seems hard to lose you so soon." "I will not be lost to you, Noria." "But you will not be my own sweet little Annie; you will be a sober matron: you cannot walk with me, nor sing with me-you will be constantly with your husband."  - "I think not, my dear sister; but wait and see." At this moment they were joined by Peter and Emily-who were to be united at the same time--and Monteith. The cori- versation became general and animated, until they separated, leaving Annie and Monteith alone. When the rest were gone, Monteith drew Annie's arm within his own, and, walking towards a small pavilion not far from the house, and so surrounded by the banana and other trees, as to be completely shaded from  all outward view, he entered with her, and they took seats on the low cushions that were placed around. Taking her hand in his own, he said: "And now, Annie, dearest, tell me whether any regrets min- gle with the bright anticipations of this day?" Annie turned slowly towards him, and, with a serious smile, said:                   i "Not one, Henry: I know that you are upright and true, and I esteem you as much as I love you. Mine is not the- affection of a  day; sorrow nor affliction will not conque: it. Why should I regret that which has made me happy?" c ntinued she, her countenance lighting up with that same glad, happy expression which had so often enchanted him. "Then you are happy?" said Henry; " doubts and fears do not disturb you?" Annie paused a moment before she answered; then, with a bright, trusting smile, she said: "I have no doubts, no fears, Henry. I do rot expect life will be perpetual sunshine; but I intend, when the storms come, still to be hopeful, and banish doubt and distrust from our dwelling." !      300         ANNIE WALLACE. Henry made no reply; but, parting the wavy tresses on her brow, he stooped and imprinted a kiss upon it; and then rising, they walked hastily towards the house. Annie entered alone, and retired to the privacy of her own chamber, where she remained absorbed in her own reflections until the attendants entered to assist in arraying her for the important ceremony. A large party are assembled in the parlor of Senor Jose Mar- cella's mansion. The room into which the guests were ushered was almost entirely paneled with English looking-glasses, in gorgeously gilded frames, extending nearly from the top to the bottom of the apartment, multiplying the room in its apparent extent, almost boundlessly, and making the guests, seemingly, as numerous as " bees in spring-time." The furniture and decorations of the room, which were. partly English and partly oriental, were of a correspondent magnifi- cence, and, altogether, presented a scene of splendor seldom sur- passed. Sitting behind a small table, placed between the front windows, is the pastor of the English church, waiting to perform the mar- riage ceremony. Presently he arose, as the bridal party entered the room from a door at the lower end. Annie is attired in a robe of pure white crape, arranged with beautiful simplicity, a spotless veil hanging to her feet. In her bosom is placed a small boquet, made up of orange-blossoms freshly gathered. Hope, happiness, and love illumine her countenance as she advances into the room. At her side is Henry Monteith. His dark eyes sparkle with unusual animation, while upon his pale, intellectual face rests an expression of true and serious tenderness, as he looks upon the fair girl at his side. He loves her, and not a doubt of her affec- tion clouds the happiness of this moment. Long may the bright hopes and pure affections, that hallow this hour, remain to bless and beautify their path.   THE MiARRIAGE    i.      301 Their vows are pronounced--the minister offers a prayer-- and Annie Wallace and Henry Monteith are husband and wife. They-, exchange places with Peter and Emily, and a second cere- mony unites them in the holy bands of marriage. As the ceremony closes, and friends surround the brides to offer kind wishes and congratulations, a strain of oriental melo- dy is heard sounding from a distant apartment-thl e sittar, the sarinda, the kurtaul, with the saringee (an instrument played at Eastern weddings), united their harmonies to enliven the guests. When these withdrew, the company adjourned to another apart- ment to partake of the marriage-feast, during which a band from on board a man-of-war regaled them with music more suited to their taste. A few hours later, the guests had dispersed, and our young friends were left to the quiet happiness of the family circle. In a beautiful valley, among the Highlands of Scotland-the lofty peak of Ben Lomond towering above them, with the beau- tiful lake stretched out as a mirror at its base on one side, and "Dumbarton's bonnie dell" on another---was the romantic resi- dence and family country-seat of the Earl of Rutland (our former friend, Henry Monteith, who had succeeded to the title through the death of his uncle); and here was spent the greater part of the year-Annie's town residence, in Edinburgh, present- ing few charms to her, partly from the unpleasant associations connected with it, and partly from her ardent love of country life and scenery.        Two years have passed since the history of the last events in our tale. It is a season of unusual rejoicing in the family; as Peter-now Lieutenant Wallace-and Henry have each but just returned from a long cruise, and on this day are out with their attendants on a hunting-excursion. Annie is sitting in her boudoir with Noria and Emily, when a servant enters, saying that- 26     302        ANNIE WALLACE.  "c A man of mean appearance is at the gate, and begs to see the Countess of Rutland." "Did he tell you his business?" inquired the countess., He will tell neither name nor business, but earnestly beseeches that my lady will not deny him." ; I will see him," said Annie; " conduct him into the hall." "For pity's sake, Annie, do not venture to see this man alone," said Noria, in a tone of alarm; "he may be a ruffian  with evil intent."  "Do not fear, Noria, I have no enemies now. It is most likely a supplicant for charity; besides I shall see him in the hall-the servants will be in sight." So saying, Annie tripped gaily out of the room. As she entered the hall, a man stood waiting in an humble attitude, wrap- ! ped in a large cloak, with a slouched hat drawn down so as to almost conceal his features, which were pale and emaciated.  i Annie approached him, and asked, kindly, what she could do to : serve him.  He answered her in a low tone, that he wished to see her pri- vately for a few moments. As he spoke, something in his voice jarred unpleasantly upon her ear; but he seemed so wretched, and spoke in such a supplicating tone, that Annie, although she felt it imprudent to comply, could not find it in her heart to refuse his request. Opening a side-door, she motioned him to enter. He fol- lowed her into the room, and stood as if waiting to be addressed. Annie again asked him, in a gentle voice: ", Will you please to tell me, sir, why you wish to see me " Suddenly throwing off his hat, and advancing two or three steps, he disclosed the countenance of-Walter Jamieson! A thrill of indescribable horror ran through Annie's frame as she recognized her old persecutor in the wan and haggard being before her. A faint scream issued from her lips, and instinctively she reached forward ro the bell-rope. Anticipating her inten- tion, Walter sprang towards her, saying: "Lady Rutland-Annie-do not fear me. See,' said he, throw-   THE MARRIAGE.          303 ing off his cloak, and pointing to his right shoulder, from which the arm had evidently been amputated, " I could not harm you if I would; and, thank God for his mercy in bringing me to repentance for my transgressions, I would not if I could. As he finished speaking, he sank into a chair, apparently unable longer to stand on his feet. Annie, recovering from her fright, was filled with compassion for the wretched man. Approaching him, she said, with a voice trembling with emotion: "Why have you sought me, Walter? What can I do for you ?" "I sought you to ask your forgiveness. God has forgiven me for his Son's sake, and I know you will not refuse." Annie reached out her hand, which he grasped eagerly. "I forgive you, Walter, from my heart, and I am rejoiced at the spirit that is in you: but you are suffering. Again I ask, what can I do for you ?" The wretched man bowed his head a few moments, and then said: "I have not tasted food for two days. I came here to ask your pardon and die." Annie was entirely overcome at this disclosure of his destitu- tion. Sinking down in a chair, she burst into a flood of tears. Bitterly had he atoned for his misdeeds. Recovering herself presently, she arose and left the room to obtain food for him. Returning soon, she placed before him wine and substantial food, which he devoured with the eagernesswof a starving man. After he had refreshed himself, he related to Annie how, that, after he had been wounded by Philip, he had lingered for months on a sick bed; how he had risen from it a penitent man; and how, after the most intense suffering from want and destitution, he had, at last, succeeded in reaching Scotland, and resolved to find her, to ask her pardon and die. Annie was greatly affected by his recital. She bade him lie down on the sofa and sleep, and she would return to him again in a few hours. Thus she left him until the return of her hus- band and brother.     304         ANNIE WALLACE. It was towards the evening of the next day that Henry and Peter entered the room where Walter Jamieson was. For the first time, as they looked at him, they could not fail to realize that the "way of the transgressor is hard." They had been occupied through the day in making every arrangement for the permanent comfort and support of Walter Jamieson while he lived; and Peter truly felt this day, that to return good for evil was sweeter revenge than taking his enemy's life. Reader, our tale is ended. If it has amused or profited you, we are content.
