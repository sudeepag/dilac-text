"Thanks Colonel for the hint, but

Chris was seized with a violent
-sneezing, for which the Doctor pre-
scribed Aqua Ammonia inhaled at in-
tervals of fifteen minutes. The old
man then walked with Brantly to the
fire where Ruger was stretched.
"'Get me home as early as you can.
I am suffering very much," said the
Federal.
A squad of four of Brantly's men
was called to lift the hitter and Ruger
was placed in the carriage. The Doc-
tor bowed and ordered the driver to
move slowly.
Chris sat musing as the vehicle
rolled by towards the house of last
night's adventure. He could not dis-
miss the trim form he held in his
arms a few hours before.

The girl courtesied and retired.

after.

Hal attired in full riding habit de-
scanded to the yard and walked to
the lane. The arched neck of the
brown stallion curved grandly as he
heard Hal's step. She patted his
forehead, and mounted. The petted
horse reared, pawing playfully. She
touched his flank with a riding whip.
Count sprang away with the leap of
a buck.
"You'll grind your corn before you
get it, Count, so ho; easy now. Iead-
way's a long jaunt."
Hal rode towards the post office
until out of sight of home, then-
changed direction avoiding the public
highways. The discomfiture of Ru-
ger's command secured a liberal rest
to Brantly's force until noon. Then
the line of march was resumed in the.
direction of General Stuart. This in-
trepid sabreur was watching McClel-
lan's movements, and at the same
time diverting him from the plans of
the Confederate Chief.
Lee had not yet crossed the river.
Stuart was two day's march in ad-
vance of him. Chris Spangler fresh
as a lark was out and away in ad-
vance of Branty. Like a falcon, he
was ever keen for game.
l'he scout rarely exposed himself to
publicc observation, and few  could
i(lentify the man, while the souihri-
uet, "Wolf" was fauniliar to both
armies and the people of the occupied
country.

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.

He had lain     for  hours  in' the
silent glen until his limbs stiffened
with cold.
If any of Ruger's command desired
to join the body of Sheridan's troops,
they must come by this route. They
had already passed or few desired to
re-join. Finally his ear caught the
click of shodden hoofs on the rocky
road. , A Federal soldier rode by.
The scout slipped from his cover
and ran around the hill to intercept
the new comer.
Cocking his carbine it was leveled
s the Federal rounded the hill road.
"Halt." -
The Federal attempted  to unsling
his gun, but the challenge assured
him it was too late to resist.
"Drop your hands, or I'll shoot."
The surprised man reluctantly
dropped his hands.
"Dismounts"
This, too, was mechanically  done.
The ready carbine still rested in the
left hand of the scout.
"Hitch up, please, and let's confer.':
The Federal fastened his horse and
laid down his gun.
"I am looking.for all the informa-
tion possible concerning the move-
ments of Sheridan. If you have any
and will give it as a prisoner, so good;
if not, I must demand it."
"What I have concerns others. As
for myself you have the advantage.
You can dictate my personal condi.
tions, but nothing  that  concerns
duty."
 "I would not have you willinglv'to
abandon duty," rejoined Chris. "He's
a lame lubber who would; but mine is
is the face of yours. You to resist.
mine to insist. Plain now, have you
any dispai ches on your person?"
"That I decline to answer."
"My brave fellow, I am obliged to
dictate terms. If you have papers

turn them over or I must possess
them whether or no!"
"I'll never give them up willingly !"
"Then unwillingly."  Chris raised
his carbine and aimed it at the

Federal's head. -
The brave captive eyed
without a blink.
"Hand them out."
"You have but one way to

The scout extended his hard palm1
to the Federal. The other smiled a
they sbook hands. They sat together.)
Chris had lain aside his gun. Bothl
were as calm  as if no feud divided
their sections.                 2
Chris drew from his haversack/'a
liberal snack which the Federaljar-
took of heartily, then both lit pipes.
"Now for business," began the scout.
The Federal nodded unconcernedly.
"Since you decline to surrender any
papers; are you willing to make a
verbal statement?"
"Depends entirely  on  what the
statement refers to."
"Of course to the movements of
Sheridan," rejoined Chris.
"I  shall not give    information
of, any kind affecting adversely the
plans of my commander. To save
myself at the expense of probably
hundreds of my comrades, would be
cruelly craven; to save myself at the
expense of the confidence reposed in
me is equally cowardly. No, you
can't get any information from me. so
you had better decide at once what
next."
"Spoken like a true man. Here's
my hand.
Good; take your carbine at twenty
paces. Fire at the word, 'ready, one,'
are you agreed?"

"You are generous beyond any
right of mine to expect it. Your
name please?" inquired the Federal
rising to his feet.
"Chris Spangler, scout of Stuart;
and  yours?"  'lhe scout had   also
risen, both men standing over six feet.
"-Harry Newbold, of Fourth Indiana
Cavalry."
- Chris motioned Newbold to his gun.
The two men stood back to back.
"Count ten paces, I will do the
same. Halt at the word. Fire at
the right about.
"One, rwo, three, four; ' until ten
was deliberately tolled off.
"Halt," both stood fast.
"Ready, one," both carbines flashed
together, both men fell. Chris re-
covered to find a savage wound in his
left thigh. The blood flowed freely.
Drawing a heavy knife that was worn
under his   hirt, he limped towards
Newbol     The Federal endeavored
to struggle to his feet but fell back
heavily.  A red stream ran from  his
side - ['he scout at once saw that he
had the advantage, and tearing away
the Federal's clothing improvised a
rude  bandage   over the  wound to
staunch the blood. The Federal had
fainted.

secured  an envelope  addressed  to
General Sheridan, then   the  scout

evere flesh wound. The scout return-
Ad to his horse, managed to get in the
saddle, rode to a near farm house for
assistance for the Federal, then con-
finued on in search of Brantly.
It was about nine o'clh ck when he
'eacled the c )mmand. At once he
surrendered  the  envelope   to his
Colonel, then summoned Scipio to get'
"'some grub," after which he bathed
and doctored the swollen, stiffened
leg.

The negro fearing he had already

Chris quite amused fell into a deep
sleep.
We left Hal on hei way to the
locality known as Dead way. Desir-
ing to avoid the frequented roads, her
ride was necessarily longer than by a
direct route. About two o'clock she
galloped into a deep defile that ran
near a boiling stream of turbid waters
on one side, while on the other the
jagged boulders pointed out and every
way their flinty bare edges. Here
and there a stunted trunk lifted out
of shallow soil. Every where sterility
gloomily" prevailed. A fit habitation
for an outlaw or a jackal. The dar-
ing woman knew the dismal retreat
well as she mounted to a bare hill top
where a shallow tarn was barely freed
of the ice of last night. Placing the

was allowed to go to the water.
"'Tis a sorry hour for visitors if
charity- stays behind."
A tall crone was seen emerging
from  an  aperture in the hill side.
Rags reeking with negligent poverty
fluttered from a repulsive tawny
form. Long gray and black hair fell
loosely on -her skinny neck.    Jet
black sunken eyes, bony hands of a
forbidding color, and -a mouth fanged
with  a few   discolored  protrusio)ns
represented the creature who spoke.
"It is charity to suppose that visit-
ors are unwelcome," returned Hal,
"judging from your temper when one
happens along."
"Happens along; so says      Hal
Armour. When figs grow on bram
ble bushes and nectar flows from ai
cow's horn, then any happening will
not set us a wonderin'.  Well, what's
to do?"
"Where's Ike?" enquired Haber -
lently.
"Ike said, he was to be nowhere
until he gave me leave to say else
wise, returned the surly crone.
"That's not ambiguous enough for
a lie. Can't you say if he is in the
glen?"
"Lies is as often worth paying' for as
the truth. Who   knowsthat better
nor you, Mistress Hal?"
The woman squatted on a boulder
and picked the fangs with a knitting
needle.
"Your logic is as refined as your
cunning is greedy. I want Ike."
'I knows that well enough, and so
does I want him. Ef Ike is at your
beck and call, afford his mother a
reason for allowing it."
"There you are." A small gold coin
rolled at the crone's feet. "I want Ike."

"This may find him, but it don't

The woman seized the money and
dodged. away   among    the  rocks.
It was , possibly an half hour later
when approaching foot steps caused
Hal to look up. She was standing
by the horse, whipping carelessly at
her flowing skirt. The fresh arrival
was a gaunt, cadaverous man of full
six feet, covered in a much worn suit
of buckskin. Red hair, and reddish
tags of beard covered his neck and
face. He wore heavy wagon boots
and carried a new repeating rifle A
coonskin cap completed his attire.
The cap was jerked respectfully as he
came near.
"Ike, I. have job.for you. A good
one as you may imagine, hence so long
a ride."
"Well'm, we may disagree 'bout the
goodness of it. Looks like    taint
op'lar if you has to look this fur to
git somebody to tend to it."
Ike knew the person before him and
was cautious.
"I do not know that your services
have ever cost you more than so
much 'time. If I have put you at dis-
advantage heretofore say so, and I
will recompense you for it."
"Has'nt cost me so far, but kain't

Mistress Hal, let's year 'bout it."
"Ike, I can get you a place at good
pay as sharp shooter with   Ruger.
You'll be relieved from regular duty
and will be free to select your ground,
if you would like to practice on a
rebel subject for me."
The guizzical face of the astonished
Ike almost upset Hal's equanimity as
he replied.

"Tut, tut, coward. Let me explain.
You've heard of "the Wolf"?
The crone started and sidled close
to Ike.
"Not a step; don't stir a foof."
"Yes'm," returned Ike, "I'se yeard

story book kerricter. He's best un-

"ie will scour this whole section
perhaps alone during the ntxt week.
I don't want him killed. If you can
wound and capture him I will give

eagle.
K"Mistress Hal, I'se seed some rough
times in life, but money can't pay me
for going stock blind into trouble.
Git some one else please."
Ike was seriously earnest.
"If you refuse, its only necessarykto
let Stuart know, there's a bushwhacker
in the Deadway, and what then?"
The wretch trembled from head to
foot.
"I might let one of Stuart's officers
know that Mistress Hal Armour    ."
"Silence fbol!" sternly ordered the
enraged woman. "Do as I expect, or
I shall turn you over to the rebels."
Hal mounted her horse from the
back of the bushwhacker who had
prostrated himself on all fours at her
word.   She touched   the   stallion
lightly with the whip and retraced
her way home at a canter which was
not slackened until arriving after
night.

The wounded Federal had not been
paroled by Brantly. For this intend-
ed omission, he felt under no pledge
to secrecy.
The paper was committed to a ser-
vant with orders to look out for strag-
glers, thus to have it forwarded.
Brantly divined rightly that the dis-
patch would be duplicated, as it after-
wards proved and  resolved  to join
Stuart in time to fight Pleasanton.
At early dawn the Colonel was well
on the way. The scout's wound com-
pelled him to loll in a wagon, while
Scipio rode close alongside on Rocket.
The   command   moved    steadily
at  a    walk,  the   horses  hav-
ing    been    hard    used   for
many days, yet by noon had made
twenty miles.
The extreme wintry weather drove
all indoors who could excusably re-
main there. None of the enemy were
visible.
A short h       s ordered to feed.
.While the animals were crunching
their corn and the men eating the
rations captured on the (lay previous,
a sudden roar of artillery was hear
together with the sharp rattle of small
arms.
The bugle rang out "to saddle." The
ready command spurred gaily towards
the rising smoke.
Stuart had camped in a field with
his back to a thin pinery. In his
front a road led west, at his rear two
roads diverged enst. He had cautious-
ly selected this spot in case of a sud-
den attack. He could cover a retreat
by the intervening pit, and escape
at " either sidle of the field. His
videttes were pushed in on the two
roadls running east. The Federals
gallping in .or an easy ting as they
supposed.
Running    six  howitzers in  the
pinery, Stuart held both column

back under a brisk shower of grape
Dismounting every available man he
stretched his line to meet the vastly
heavier force that swarmed in and
was extending its arms still beyond.
It was but a question of strategy
and time. The Federals could swing
around to the western road, then re-
treat would he cut off and the greater
force win the fight.
Never had the gallant Virginianw
been more completely invested, as he
saw column after column plunging
through the environing woods to cir-
cumvent his escape, while in his front
a force equal to his own held him in
the pinery. Yet never floated his
plume in jauntier trim, than when he
rode to the six how itzers, and ordered:
"Two guns to the left stand fast
firing as briskly as you can. Four
guns limber up and follow me."
Soon four cannons were hauled t(
the extreme opposite side of the pinery
and a cross fire was opened on th 3
enemy's front.
The first idea was that reinforce-
ments hadarrived.
This made Tleasanton cautious.
The next thought was to charge the
wood where the weakest artillery fire
was.
This was Stuart's plan, to lose two
guns if he must. The heavy cross fire
forced the Federals away from one of
the roadsTas they formed for the
charge. The buglers stood ready for
the retreat.
The Federal columnsain splendid
style prepared for the assault. As
they moved up on the woods Stuart's
rifles and howitzers cut themtdown
like ripe grain _
Still they swept forward.
Ont reaching the two cannons, they
raised a tantalizing, hip, hip, hura;
then drove through the pinery.

Stuart moved for the open road and

"Ya, ya, ya," was echoed back from
tauit's men.

"Because sir, he is known in this
locality and closely watched. You
have a dashing maiden here, Hal
Armour, who is playing spy. I could
wind the game, up ere another sun
,ut prefer not. She is bitter against
us,"
Chris substituted cleverly "us" to
shield his Colonel from an undue sus-
picion, knowing well that he was as
confessedly marked by the woman.
The Judge arched his brows with
surprise, and replied, "She is a trouble-
some vixen; I will watch her."
"Brantly's wound is of a compound
nature and needs close care. Any
severe jolting or neglect would possi-
bly cost him the arm  if not his lift.
He consents to rest awhile. Shall I
bring him to-night?"
"Assuredly," replied the Judge.
It will be midnight, m3 dear sir,
before we return."

I seldom throw down my reading
until that hour. At any rate, you
get him here as soon as you can.'
The scout leaned on the Judge's
arm  and   reached  his horse by the
back stairway.
Col Brandy was placed in an am-
bulance. Chris joined him.   Scipio
had made a bundle of the Colonel's
clothing and was affectionately press-
ing his free hand when Ralph order
ed the vehicle ahead.  Twelve stout
stout men   rode as an   escort and
guard. Brantly's horse was led by
one of the men. The drive was made
without interruption.  The citizens
housed from the cold night, had be-
come familiar to the hostile tramp of
armies. Brantly stepped out, assisted
by Ralph.   The Judge met them at
the door.   The wounded ofhcer was
assigned promptly to a comfortable
warm   chamber.   Ralph and Chris
said goodnight, and the escort return-
ed to camp.
"Now, Colonel, we have dressed the
arm. The bell cord is just in reach.
Get some rest. I'll see you early."

The larks may not have roused the
sound sleeper, but the robins did.
These t ame chirpers were h' ping
over the snow and ibilling of the win-
dow panes for stray icrunibs.  The
sun was hlazin ii like a silver glory
over the whitened earth. The leaIfhls

storm and ice enhoke. Natutire in (uiiet
beauty  was again frm uiin'r t he

The clock pointed to nine.  He wa

"The sooner the better for me, my

myself is to endanger my safety."
The gentlemen descended in com-
pany to the parlor.
The events of our tale press one
upon the other so rapidly, that it is
hazarding the patience of the reader
to moralize by the wvay. The (lays of
Brantly's enforced furlough sped yby
with pleasant rapidity amid the (e-

able family of his hosts. Any pastime
desired from chess to music relieved the

For tTenty minutes he was borne
away with the brilliancy of a most
artistic performance. The gentlest

Chris Spangler was so f'ar recovered,

of re-crossing the river and entering
the enemy's lines to learn something
of Brantly.
Stuart's entire force had been safely
withdrawn after the last fight men-

ly severe- winter had gone into snug
quarters  Ralph had applied for and
procured a furlough to go hone. As
sulming the heavy overcoat worn by
the Federals, (which article was as
cornmon among the Confederates as
the enemy, on account of the frequent
captures made of Federal stores and
supplies) the scout started out at
night on the proposed expedition. The

captured  on  the Brent road. He

avenue as they passed. Stuart was as
full of laugh as a man could be, but
he didn't mind sayin good mornin.
The banjo was a peeling all the time."
"How close was Pleasanton behind?"
enquired Chris.
"He wasn't behind at all. You see,
he'd gone by the old turnpike and
spected to cut em off' afbre they got, to
the brick kiln ford; youpassed that
didn't yer?"
Chris nodded.
"Wa'al, ef he'd a met em there as
they riz out of the ford Pleasanton
would have pounded all fires (the
farmer's evangelical license for an
unorthodox expletive) out of Stuart."
"Some how, I kain't tell; seems to
me,sogers ain't much on tactics no way.
Stuart got away, and Pleasanton rode
back,.
Chris smiled as he led on with the
view of finding out more.
"So you think soldiers ain't much
any way.' Pleasanton is a bold fighter,
Stuart eluded him. Stuart must be a
soldier."
"What I mean is, how kin a General
be so slow as to let a banjo lover run
round him. Ef little Mac don't do
better, he'll follow Pope."
"Pleasanton will keep his eyes on
Stuart you depend, if I know the man.
He's watching him every hour."
"Not so! le's gone into camp they
say, away t'oher side of the Brent road;
my som was at home on leave yester-
day."
A new idea occurred to the scout.
The young girl was on the piazza fill-
ing the water pail that stood on a
shelf at the door.
"I'll get some water."
He went to the piazza. The girl
met him with an anxious look.
"Go," she said. "My cousin is re-
cruiting in the settlement and will be
back at noon."

She spoke low.
"Why should I leave on his ac-
count?" asked Chris.
"Not on his, but on our account; for
peace sake ! You'll get no good here."
Her imploring look told him, that
she was a friend.
The scout carelessly loitered to the
stable, bridled his horse and watered'
him, then led him in front.
Bidding his host goodbye, he said
a pleasant word or two to the wite,
then mounted.
As he rode away he looked back
and saw the girl's hand motioning him
Godspeed.
"I had better let Rocket loosen his
muscles. It will not do to get up any
to do over here unnecessarily." He
spurred the stout horse to a full canter.
It was well for the peace of the house
that the scout left so soon. A heartv
young Federal lieutenant of cavalry
entered the house soon after, and care
lessly asked:
"Who's been along since I left?"
"A scout I reckon." replied the
father with innocent assurance of the
fact.
"A  scout!  Who's scout?  Where
was he from?" eagerly followed up the
soldier. -     I
"Wa'al I didn't ax him perticklers.

and  I spoed no one but the right
kind would go in Lee's camp and

"You   are aptly logical  father.
Couldn't a scout of Lee.' "-
The eyes .of the oldman dilated as
if in view of a grave discovery, "have
truthfully said, I've been in Lee's
camp?"
"Ya'as boy, but t',as the wayhe

"No; nary ia oine\ He jist let me

Stuart got away and Pleasanton had
gone into camp beyan the Brent road,
pow did I mother?"
"Nary a word more nor less," re-
plied the old wife positively.
"What kind of a horse did he ride?"
required the Federal, "I'll see if I can
find him."
"He was a big blood bay, small
star in front, branded U. S. A., left
hind foot white above the fetlock, full
tail with a kind of morgan get up."
The young lieutenant recognized a
similarity to the horse, which the sup-
posed deserter had  spirited  away
from his guards, and thought, the mat-
ter worth further investigation. He
jumped on his steed, a noble gray,
and galloped down the lane.
"He'll ride through Deadway ou
his road to Brent's; I'll cut hhn off
and if I miss him. put a watch their
while I look out as he copies out th(
Pass. He may take the Hill roa(
instead of the Post route."
The young Federal dashed fleet])
across cow  paths and byways redu
ing the route at least two miles; thi
added to the thundering pace of t
gray put him in the Deadway fully
mile ahead of Chris. The ambition
cavalryman hesitated a moment.
"He may have gone on. He       a m
not. Confound it, why did not I a
when he left?  Yes, he left ust aft
breakfast. Of course he did."
He plunged spurs to the gray a
rattled over the rocky Pass.
He approached a narrow deep ce
where in places either hand cout
touch the bold wet rocks that slant

u1p orl hung gloomily over.  le way
was sodden with a damp muck and a
black o+ ze spurted at each pressure of
the hoof, or the cautious animal escap-
ing this would slip over a sliny rock-
bed ,f jagged projectinons. The echo
was ghostly as the rider slowly guided
his horse. Emerging iromn this, he
came to  a cavernous area indented
v ith dark fissures and lit, by a ant
break ahead that led to the hills.
He had rilden but a few yards,
when a stealthy figure glided unseen
to the opening of one of the fissures
and carefully exainied the rider.
"Tain't he,' muttered the prson,
yet unseen by the  ed(lerall.
As the latter rose to he clearing,

He dropped in her palm a piece of
silver, and was about to move on.
"One minute," she said.    "Dis-
mount and walk. You get on the offl
side I'll walk on this. Ef you does'nt
you'll beihit and never see the shooter."
"So ho !" replied Chris. "I'm much
obliged, but as I'n not in good trim
for walking, hat say you for a ride?"
"I does'nt o ject, ef you only makes
it, as if I could'nt help it, you know,"
replied the crone.
"Put your shoe on mine, there, up."
He gave her a pull and lifted her
safely in front of him.  'i
The crone perfbrrned the farce of a
pretended resistance, while Chris sup.
pressing a laugh, said gruffly, "be
quiet you hag or I'll choke you."
Ike was concealed in the recess of a
rock as they rode by. His rifle lay
on his left arm.
"Bygumhe must grip tight when
mudder kain't squeal; durn me, that's
the Wolf."
Arriving at the top of the Dead-
way road Chris released the crone.
am much obliged for your kind-
be.o"d soul; I am saved a bullet may
be."
"Yes indeed, one's bin in waiting
for you hard on a fortnight. You
knows Hal Armour?"
Chris laughed heartily.
"I'll tell her, I rode through Dead-
way with--"
"Prudence Shaulon in your arms.
Golly she'll sputter," returned the
hag grinning. "Now, don't he in a
hurry, my Jo," continued the woman.
"You'se only half over the danger.
Another chap's waiting'iid at the
crossing. Don't ride off until you
hear three clear whistles like a dog
call. I'll pack the first, one after the
other to git him on the wrong road.
The other feller won't face you in
daylight. Then you can ride ahead

f while, t'other one's searching for you."
"You   are a   strategist," replied
Chris, "and why your care of me?"
"Because I want to save you for
Hal:  I hate the jade."
Chris wondered what she meant as
he saw the woman disappear out (f
sight.
"Ike," screamed the hag, dashing
to his retreat; "he's tuck the Hill
road, tell your pard to meet him
there. You take care of yourself for
he's the devil hisself."
Ike ran fleetly for the fork which
he reached in ten minutes; gave the
information to the Federal who rode
smartly up the Hill road, ordering
Ike to follow.
Chris remained where he was a
quarter of an hour, and left when he
heard the whistle signal, following the
Post road which led to, the Cleapor
house, which the hag knew he desired
to reach.
Riding warily and much interested
in his adventures, he suddenly cane
upon Ike, who believing the scout had
taken the Hill road as his mother said,
thought it prudent to cross over to
the Post road and return to his den.
The cunning bushwhacker took to
the underbrush with rifle cocked and
ready, in his attempt to escape.
Chris rode on as if not observing
him, until enough of wood growth
intervened to confuse the aim of a
timid shot, then he halted the skulker.
Both rifles were raised at the chal-
lenge.  Whei  the smoke cleared the
iishwacker was limping slowly away.
The scout rode after him. The wretch
attempted to raise his rifle a second
time but, fell dead at the next fire of
the scout.
Chris rifled his pockets, securing
several paper. Took his repeating
rifle, spurned the degraded  corpse
with his boot and left the locality.

An examination of the papers taken
from the bushwhacker afforded the
scout intense interest as he jogged
along. The first was a rude diary
much  worn and   barely   legible for
dirt. A strangely index plicable at-
tempt at lexigraphy. By dint of hard
study the scout extracted a connect-
ing idea of the record.  It ran:

A neat little note fell from the back
of the memorandumI book. It read:
"You are right ! There is a Con-

decr p!Itold figure doubled in a hide
seated chair.
"It's cold enough for more fire," re-
marked the woman who was younger
by twenty years and in excellent
health.
She rose to get a fresh log, but
Chris anticipated her, in politely
doing the service.
The woman eyed him     as a phe-
.1tinenal intrusion.
In return for the gallantry, with a
woman's appreciation, she rose and
sat the coffee pot on a bed of coals.
A pone of cornbread and the remnant
of a roast fowl were placed to warm.
"You're consumed by the army
worm; are you not, Mrs Bentham?"
"Yes; we can hold nothing these
days stranger !" She emphasized the
stranger, as if surprised at his ac-
quaintance with her name.
"Don't put me down in the multi-
tude of cormorants," said Chris, pull-
ing his hand from   his pocket, and
laying a greenback on her knee.
"It's hard enough to find the wel-
come, one might pay the roast."
"You're one of a few, very few,
that care to help us poor ones! I'm
obliged. It comes in well for corn
and such like I"
She placed the meal on the table
and sat ready to help the scout.

the fire.

the postmaster still live around? I'd
like to see him."
Chris was eyeing his hostess over a
coffee cup from which he was enjoy-
ing a palat -able drink.
''Jim Rodman, you mean, who was
a justice of petty cases?"
Chris nodded.
"Yes; he's alive; more's the shame.
A fellow of good mental parts, sleek
of tongue and tidy always in dress.
But as a whole a sneak, as mean a
villain as ever juries failed to con-
vict."
"Mother," said the old man, "t'wont
help the evening's pleasure to tell
what the gentleman   may know al-
ready."
''If he does, it won't hurt ! If he
does'nt he ought to. A man of Jim
Rodman's parts, (he's my cousin I'm
ashamed to own) who'd forge and
swear it on another, play the part of
a hospitable host to a sick stranger to
secure his confidence and swindle him.
Get a foung chap tipsy to marry him
off for the hope of a reward or to
levy blackmail ! Is it surprising he'd
get drunk when he could'nt do any-
thing else? Steal his wife's table silver
or his seven year old child's cabbage
plants to get whiskey! Don't tell me
about Jim Rodman. I wish Stuart
had carried him off two weeks ago."
The indignant wife looked   with
scrutinizing eyes to see the effect on
the soldier.
"The same Jim," said Chris, rising
and coming to the fire.
"He's a bad lot. Let's see-he
married young, pshaw; the names get
away."
"Howard    Graham,, of Georgia,
to Hal Prentiss."
Chris was stuffing his pipe. "Pren
tiss," thought he. "How is it changed
from Armour?"
As he stooped to pick up the coal

I'

for his pipe, he continued, "Pity the
young folks didn't stay together. They
acted 'foolishly, but made it worse by
breaking so soon.
"Yes, the whole thing's a pity; you
see Hal was a pretty girl.  She was
as taking a young thing as ever was
seen. She was at a seminary in the
same city  where   Howard    was at
college. They saw one another often,
and got up a big flirtation.   Conm-
mencement day came, Howard deliver
ed the valedictory.  Hal presented
the b'uet for the speaker. The col-
lege hovYs had a big dinner.  Howard
was full of wine. They say, wine tells
the truth. Howardl drove Hal out.
Told her of his love, wealth, &amp;c. They
were secretly married by Jim Rod-
man. Howard went South next day
after he sobered and has never re-
turned that I know of. They say,
he wrote, that, he had not won over
his parents, but the belief is that he
bribed Rodman to say the marriage
was taiidulent."
The good woman was full of in-
dignatiou as she put away the supper
things.
"Two young fools together," re-
marked Chris.
"She's awful hot against South-
erners. I've told her right here, she'd
regret it. Hal does'nt fear old nick
himself. She'll ride anywhere. T he
truth is, she is stabbed with cruel de
sertion and I feel sorry for her. But
what can you expect? Her father was.'
"Do now mother, let this old store
go. Tell our friend something h~

wife, "I'll drop the Prentisses. You

muau live now? or is he at the ol

place?" enquired Chris.
"He's at the old place. Somehow
these dirty scamps keep in with the
officials."
An hour more was spent in very
enjoyable chat, then Chris proposed to
go.
The pair objected, but it was a
clear night and he must make a few
miles more, so good night, he'd call
again sure.
"Christopher, Christopher. Cone
old man, you're losing all your inter-
est in old time affitirs. Christopher.
Let me see. There was a Christopher
Hoggins lived   on  the Sweet Run.
He'd be sixty, seventy, eighty and two
years.  T'ain't he.   There was a
Christopher-."
"Columbus," chimed in the hus-
band. "Grace, you've talked me al-
most daft. Now have you thought
for a moment of Christopher Spang-
ler?"
'Lor Sakes! The Wolf! You are
right. He is'nt over thirty years.
Heavens; if the Yankees knew he'd
been here ! Let's shut up and go to bed'.
"Pit    ou had'nt shut up an hour

The scout did not know, but that
the half drunk postmaster might
shoot. He called out:
"Say Rodman, I've a bit of a mes-
sage for you from Ike Shanlon; shan't
keep you long."
"Ike Shanlon ! Blast the brute !
When he spots any fresh traveller he
sends word to me that it may go by
the mail. Half of his discoveries are
gammon. Hold    on, I'll open in a
minute."
As the door opened, Chris, who had
dismounted,. stepped in and was face
to face with the keen eyed Rodnan
who held a candle up to see the
visitor's face.
"Let's get to the fire," remarked
Chris.
"Build it yourself; I want to get to
bed."
Chris walked to .the chimney and
with the aid of a lot of loose paper
lying around, set a smart blaze to the
half burnt logs.
"Where's Ike's message," asked the
P.e.
"I'll keep you in expectation of it
as long as you kept me in the cold.
Sit cdown," said Chris laying his hand
on the man's arm.
The scout's build was not an invit-
ing subject even for a soured-opponent
to tackle. The angered  postmaster
uttered an oath and took a chair.
"Now for a short matter, I must
r:de further to-night."
"You may ride to the delectable
reserve, called Hades, so flt' as I amu
concerned," replied Rodman. "Out
with the business."
"Thanks, Rodman; I shall gladly
make over any titles there t  you, as
you are interested much in the do-
main thitherwvard. Ike informed me
only to-day, that you could tell me

credits, fast friends."
Lighting a segar the clownish jack
a dandy held it daintily as he eyed
the scout and said with tragic force:
"On eagles' wings immortal scandals fly
While virtue's actions are but born to die."
"You knew    Hal Armour when a
school girl?" asked the scout calmly.
"I have known her since she was
two years old, as Hal Armour Pren-
n s.

"Tell Ike he may show you -"
He pointed an index finger defiantly
down as he gazed in the scout's face.
"And more. You drop this right
where it is or your visit may be a
cause of annoyance to another than
me ."
'oc got the information from Ike, by
force, and hope I shall not have to
get it thus from you."
The postmaster sprang to his feet,
but Chris pressed him to the chair
with scarcely an effort.
"I want the date of Hal Arnmour's
marriage to Howard Graham. The
avowal be made, that he wouldino.

"'You are welcome to the informa-

The affectation of defiance hitherto
made, disappeared  on   the instant.
The P. M. lately assuming such high
flown attitudes, wilted like a scorched
leaf. The name of the scout was
peculiarly familiar to the federal P.
M.-as he conned    it over and over.
Sobered as by magic he gazed at the
hero of many an exploit told often
with exaggerations of newspapers.

that Mrs Hal Graham was of interest
to you, but of course if you as a friend
desire it, 1 will endorse what you seem
accurately to know, with pleasure."
"Kindly put that in writing."

and produced a stub of a marriage

Pouring out a heavy drink of

down. While Rodman slept, Chris
was well on his way to Judge Cleapor's
mansion.
CHAPTER VII.
PRESTO:

As Col Brantly entered the break-
fast room  on the following morning
his eyes fell on the scout. The im-
proved condition of the first was so
perceptible, that a smile overspread the
other's face as he grasped the warm
hand of the Colonel.
"It is worth a slug now and then to
freshen up as you've done in a fort..
night."
"I am doing well,,thank you, old
fellow!  How   did  7ou  leave the
General, Ralph, the boys and Scip?"
enquired Brantly sitting near Chris.
"All are doing nicely. Ralphis
off on leave."
"And you?"
"Sound as a dglar; ready for all
the Judge's good cheer to-day." The
scout had risen to meet the Judge,
who laughed an assent to the antici-
pated hospitality. The ladies entered
greeting the famous rider, ad libiture,
with the warmest adiniration    A
more cheerful gathering had not been
seen .at the home of' Judge Cleapor in
years. ,
After breakfast the gentlemen ad-
journed to the billiard room to smoke
and while an hour at the cue.
It was eleven when Chris violated i
the pleasant game by proposing a re-
turn to the parlor.         g
"Gentlemen hold me always as your y
Fidus Achates, but I ,must hear some
music. "He stacked his cue and left ih
the players.

and made no reply.

Virginia Cleapor was seated as
usual se wing.
"Will Miss Cleapor kindly lay
aside the useful a while, to gratfv a
rough trooper's ear and soul with
music?"
"Gladly ! What shall I play?" re
plied the lady accepting his escort tro
the })iano.
"What I have never realized ex-
cept as a gem of art, "The heart bowed
down, --
It is for a basso, but I will forego
the intention for the melody "
"You . are expecting   too much.
However, I will give you the aria if
not the voice."
Chris was enjoying his favorite air
when Brantly entered.
The game ended with the first
notes. The eyes of both met as if
questioning each other's thoughts.
"Miss Cleapor's best voice is heard
in 'Yesteryear;' " remarked Brantly
at the conclusion of the song. "I
had tbe pleasure of choosing pearls
from a full repertoire."
The beautiful Virginian turned and
smiled, then loaned her grand soprano
to the charming song.
Brantly now stood at the piano.
She looked up and pointing to a duet,
'Holy mother," said, "try the tenor."
He nodded; she began.
The piece was a marvel of excellent
inging. At its conclusion Chris ap-
?lauded to the encore.
"How is it you've never gratified us
3 camp?" asked the scout.
"It was owing to the absence of the
aspiration !" replied Brantly with a
implimentary bow to Virginia.
"Then," chimed in the scout, "we
hall not be favored soon again; as
ou will go with me this evening."
Brantly saw from the remark that,
s friend had a reason for the early
e   ttr art.  - i

Miss Cleapor said, "if so soon we
must get some comforts for you both,"
and left the room.
"Anything   new   Chris?"  asked
Brantly.
"Your   whereabouts  are  known,
we'd better get away. Leaving just
before sunset will be in1 tune."
"You're a wonder Ghris ! I am
strong enough to stand a long ride."
Hal was seated facing the road that
ran in the direction of the Cleapor
mansion. Dr. Prentiss had made his
last visit and dismissed the patient.
The old gentleman rapped at the door
and entered.
"What is our girl thinking of now?"
said the Doctor, putting an arm gently
round her.
"Thinking how sick some one must
be over at the Judge's."
"That old goutish attack annoys
him more frequent of late. The cold
does not help it," replied the equivo-
cating physician.
"lHe steps about as well as ever,"
replied  Hal. "Only   this morning
while I was giving'Count a brush to
to warm his coat, I met the Judge in-
specting  fences, &amp;c. Papa, he's -j
haughty man and handsome withal."
The Doctor was glad to let the chat
run a new way.
"A gentleman of the old school!
Hal, he sets much stress on proprieties
and is severe on points of honor."
"His mind runs amuck with regard
to me then ! He     never recognizes
me.  However;    Virginia, my old
room mate  of seminary days, is no
better ! We   exchange the stifiV1t
bows as we meet sometimes on the road.
"Who's to be blamed?     Hal, d
you suppose that rumor has not mad'e
free wit h your indiscretions? We
must expect the whirl wind, if we sow
to the wind. Time's revenges ar

Hal hal immediately on the occur-
rence, told her adopted father of her
clandestine marriage  with   Howard
Graham, but beyond that, she had
kept her own counsel. S() that she
was not more restive than usual under
the probe of reproof.
"it will be nea:-u re for measure, to
play at thistles with the proud Cleapors!
I shall ascertain before to-morrow who
is the wounded rebel they are taking
such go0od care of.'
'Heavens, I Ia1!!" interrupted  the
Doctor, "woublI 'iiu violate the pro-
fessirnal honor of your father?  That
household is under my care.
"Y1ou ismid a moment ago you were
attending the Judge.   1 kner you
were shielding another.  Yes sir; I
suspect that Bra ntly  or the Wolf is

The passionate, hea utif lI  u « omn

Some stranger is there for treatment.
Proof. You tell me all oftiour rounds.
Have you told me this? . Is the
patient's name on your call book?
Oh, papa! I am only a woman."
"A woman bent on ruin," replied
the Doctor.
I'doubt that!  Somehow I feel that
I am working out a decree. So head-
long am I impelled against preference
and taste.  Let the worst he soonest
and doubly worst. The end of it I'll
see."
She rose and patting the Doctor's
cheek said, "but you shall get no
harm thereby," and left the room.
At dark the Scout's horse was led
around with Brantly's   The latter
was sleek and in elegant kelter after
a couple of weeks good rest and pro-
vender. The Judge and Mrs Cleapor
were enjoying the Scout's anecdotes
on the back  porch.   Brantly  had
purposely lingered to say farewell to
the kind and lovely Virginia.
"n leaving a temporary home so
full of kindest attentions, I must
especially thank you, Miss Cleapor,
for affording so much pleasure to
hours otherwise depressed."
He held her hand.
"The pleasure, Colonel, was recip-
rocal. Many a dull, uneventful hour
was passed in enjoyment of profitable
and agreeable conversation with you."
"Except that tilt about Fate."
lie looked smiling at her.
"Oh well; I charged that to a spirit
of argument j  ;  'lconvicti n.  f'I ai
not much deceit ved  am right."
"You have eradicate an ugly
crotchet of mine, I confess; namely, to
ascertain how much I could carry that
was odious and hateful. Now; I shall
cast it off,and not be the willing
Atlas of a world of burdens not self
imposed."

She looked gladly on his cheerful
face.
"Good-bye, sweet friend! Tw
favors?"
She dropped her moist eyes.
"Your prayers I crave."
She raised her eyes and sligiiMl
nodded the promise.
"And may I recall you as Virginia.

"It will he grateful to me alwavs,
Colonel, that you may claim nua

"Us, includes Virginia.
good bye."Agan.
He entered on the porch and grasp.
ing heartily the stout palm  of the
Judge and he shapely hand of his
wife, pressed b,th warmly and sitf)
ped lightly to the saddle.
The two trotted on the road smart-
ly to the Ben tham cottage.
"Attention"!
The scout turned jokingly   upon
Brantly.
"Special order."
Number one. Colonel Brantlywill
ride under guide of a known friend to"
such a point as will be indicated. He
will on seeing the   object of hi
visit, be governed by his own sense f
duty. At the same time so much ticre-
tion as belongs to a disinterested sol-
dier will he reserved to his guide even.
if it conflicts with Brantly's views of
duty.
Signed,       Chris Spangler,
Scout of General Ptuart."
Brantly read the mock order the
jovial scout had put in his hand, and
asked:
"What means this, my dear Cap-
tain?"
"Thanks, Colonel, for the prono.
tion.  Hope'to deserve it.  It meanR
just what it says.  The reservation I
claim  may  be all right. You are
about to confront an old acquaintance.

Read that and keep it."
Brantly read the stub that James
Rodmanbad given the Scout.
"And that."
The scout put Ike's memwrandu ni
book in his hand, at same time die
ciphering in the twilight the almost
uudiscoverable scribble.
Brantly drew a hea v blood stoie
ring fr on his hand and placed it on
the scout' s.

H' as she enquired, "You've run
down, Mr. Wolf; poor thing !
Ae's head strong like her father was
before her. I did'nt give you any
clue, now, did I? I would'nt play
false to the foolish girl even if she de-
served it."
"No; you told me nothing. I got
that in another way. Well, don't
mind herloud tones I will respect her."
"Didn't I tell you what Christopher
it was, mother? I am sorry for the
shrew, but when one will not be ad-
vised, then, one must'nt blame only
oneself."  The old man moralized as
Chris stepped out.
The wife was now all ears trying to
catch the first of the approaching ex-
citement.
Chris whistled sharply at the bot-
tom of the steps that led to the upper
rooms where a lamp was burning. A
woman's voice was heard.
"Is that Ike?  Have you brought
him?"
"He's here !" replied Chris, not ex-
posing himself.
"Bring him up," returned the voice
inside.
"The boys want their pay afore
they let's him go," replied Chris.
There it is 1"  A full purse jingled
at his feet.

tonThe scouthretired and told Brantly
to enter the horse.
The heavy step of the soldier caused
the stairway to creak. He reached
the top, entered the apartment re-
spectfully, bowing, ie lait aside his
felt hat.1s
A plain suit of cottage furniture, a
center table, muslin window ang.
ings and a Confederatewunifrmhcoin-
posed the room outfit.

Hal sat at the table in a handsome
brown riding habit. The jaunty rim-
less bat trimmed with a feather which
was fastened with a star, sat charm.
ingly ort her finely poised head A
fancy whip and a pair of gauntlets
lay on the table.
"It is mortifying that I was forced
to compel an interview; you'll excuse
the unceremonious details and oblige
me by being seated."
"I experienced no annoyance in
coning hither. Apologies are out off
place. I am madam al your service."
Brantly took a chair.
"It is pleasant to hear you  say so
,much.    However,    things   have
changed. A few hours sometimes
work  miracles.   Hal a prisoner on
the Brent road, and Hal to-night are
one and the same in  sentiment, but
under different circumstances to treat
for terms.   You made a mistake in
not sending me inside your lines."
She rapped the    table  with he'
riding whip petulently.
"It is not the first mistake I made
in acting as a gentleman by you. But
as you seem to be in position to nct as
circumstances indicate, please acquai t
me of your desire ti see me at this
hour and in this questionable place."
Brantly thumbed the rounds of his
chair indifferently.
"Desire; it is not a d.-sire that I ex
pect to gratify. It is a right I intend
to assume.   Brantly! it is a right l
shall demand, with no appeal fo u
beyond the demand.   You   assumed
the base prerogative of deserting me
as one would have fled a pe t. -1
bring you back to satisfy you, that
you made an inexcusable blunder.''
The lustral eyes glowed with in-
tensest animation.
"Why beat around the bush if the
game is in it?  Out with it madam?
State your wrongs, my      base guess.

Prove either or both. I shall save
you the apprehension of any appeal I
will make for immunity. I am    all
attelitiull.
Hal was evidently  annoyed   with
the imperturbable manner of Brantly.
She felt that he was at her mercy.
Ike and his hired crew were by an
understanding below stairs ready to
do her bidding      What new light
had he, beyond the doubtful informa-
tion which he, she  knew, doubted?
She had the proofs. Rodman was un
known and inaccessible.  Ike out of
the, way.  All these thoughts flitted
threateningly and +auutingly instead
of with an assuring meanliing through
her mind.
"You challenge the issue? So be it,
Brantly."
Her tone softened  to its natural
womanly key,
"You solicited my hanc1 after ( had
given you an opportunity to decline.
When you pointedly asked the cause
of my having left the ball room and
preferred withdrawal to a more re-
tired part of the hotel, I gave you
good reasons for my conduct.  W hat
was your reply?
I'll.teach them, that my wife is not
to be ignored in any society.
Relying on your ability to main-
tain the boast, I was your wife within
an hour after.   We returned to the
hotel. Entered the ball room afresh.
You know the rest. Have I nothing
to demand?"
Brantly sat indifferent, his eyes
resting on  the opposite wall. He
dared not trust his utteran e, so try-
Sing was the issue.
Hal misunderstood his silence to be
hesitation.
.l     "I demand that you give me your
eW   name legally!  It is mine.  Less I
would not receive, no, if it were pearls

trom the deepest (live of the ocean."
"Why demand, madam, replied
Brantly  unmoved,    what you say,
you acquired?  i ly name, (lid you not
obtain it, on  that cursed night?  I
withdrew myself, not the name. if
you are ill at ease, wear it..  Will it
allay your troubles?! I think not."
"TO maintain your name when de
serted, is to add insult to ignominous
wrong. You may go where you will.
The ends of the earth would accept
ably  divide us.  Only attest this, I
am satisfied."
She pushed a paper towards him.
Brantly glanced at it and smiled.
Pushing it contemptuously back, be

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.

40            CHRIS SPANGLER, OR

She began to show the latent fire of
excitement.
"You humbled me without cause.
I shall reciprocate with this differ-
ence, I have cause.  You sought my
hand when I would have refused it.
I gave it.  You flung it aside with
contempt! I ask your signature to a
business paper.  Do you refuse it?
Do you dare as a man? Gentleman!
Fie, for shame! I can quote a trav-
esty and would have a herald shout it
on the ways where you are best
known.   The gentleman is dead;
long  live the gentleman.   Think
you, I have no reasons for demanding
rights?"
"None to my mind. Is it not well
think you, 'that in our souls are
nooks that will not open to the keys
of speech'?  Be honest now! Are
you right?"'
Brantly spoke low and calm.
"Right is so abstract a thought
that you and I cannot discuss it. Our
views of right are as much at variance
as'mine would be if I entertained any
other, than that I am basely wronged.
Brantly that signature and nothing
else will balance the account between
us. Sign that paper or take the
penalty."
"Then," replied he firmly, "I refuse
emphatically to sign anything."
"So be it."
She ,stepped to the stairway and
blew three times shrill with the
whistle of her whip. Waiting awhile
she repeated the call.  No answer
coming she ran' down the stairway
and called:
'4Ike, you cowardly loon; why d
you not come'"
Only the distant rustle of leafles
branches on the still air.
"He has his gold and skulks away
like a whelp that he is."
She re-ascended to the room.

"I am alone, but not powerless.
Brantly do you sign or not?"
No reply.
Brantly slowly   produced   Ike's
memorandum book and laid it in the
woman's hand.
She read. A flash of indignant
lightnings shot from her eyes.
He placed the stub of Rodman's
book in her hands.
Clutching  the   splendid  tresses
that swept from under her hat with
one hand, she grasp d as if for life at
her heaving   bosom  with the other.
It was only for a moment.
"Betrayed by you and your hire-
lings! I defy you all."
She crushed the papers and forced
them into the chimiev of the lamp.
Brantly sprang up and extricated
the yet uncharred documents.
"There is nothing left but sih nee,
You or I am one too  many   for the
future."
Hal had slipped to the door to cut
off Brantly's exit.
"By signing that paper, Brantly,
you save yourself."
She aimed   an ivory handled re-
peater directly at him.
"If t ou assent before the word
three, I shall not fire."
Brantly smiled at the infuriated
woman.
"One-two - your last chance-"
"We don't die easy our way, Mrs.
Hal," said Chris grasping the extend-
ed arm.
r"That's as pretty a little pop gun
as I have seen since the Brent road
escapade.  Let's keep cool and gee
o about riding! Colonel, we'll get iO
the river by day.     Mistress Hal,
s Count is at the back step."
The baffled woman yielded.   She
y saw resistance was folly.
"Lead the way, sir.   I aml snot
afraid to follow."

Chris led the way. She was care-
fully helped to her seat.  A  heavy
shawl was thrown over her, and the
Bentham cottage was left behind.
The scout while riding at the side
of his beautiful prisoner, was careful
to seethat,she met no undue exposure
from the chilly night air.
, Brantly now and then exchanged a
remark respecting the route with his
friend, otherwise the ride of nearly
eight hours was in profound silence.
At early day Chris ordered a halt in
a cedar clump. He built a smart fire
and fed the horses from provender, he
always anticipated if it was to be had
Requesting Hal with most respect-
ful and kind tones to draw near the
fire, he placed the Colonel that he
might observe the country in one
direction while he was able to watch
another.  Next   was  produced the
abundant supply of good things fur-
nished by the Cleapors.
The coffee was poured from a full
canteen into two tin cups.  Sandwich-
es, boiled eggs and a roast fowl
formed the repast.
"Madam," spoke Chris gallantly,
"refresh yourself with food.  We will
wait awhile."
"You are kind," she replied.
He had   not heard that natural,
sweet voice before.
The scout walked away giving her
2 the amplest exercise of privilege to re-
main or escape.  He returned after a
half hour and was delighted  to find
that she had part-ahen of a fair nc
Her cheeks were bright.   Her eyes
seemed to soften as he approached.
"Ha, that is brave! I shall feel as
if it was a duty to eat heartily be-
cause you have honored the meal."
He gathered a fair share for the
Colonel and carried it to the soldier
who was distant about fifty   yards
watching for any unexpected Federals

Returning, Chris in honest relish
attacked the meal.
Hal pohitely handed the  di~lerent
portions, thereby creating a pleisaniter
intercourse.
''Mistress Hal," sal ithe scout, tear-
ing the flesh from the leg of the roast
fowl, "let's be friendly. WV hy not? I
have not been the ogre you fancied
me. Come now!     Friendship for the
future; what say you?'
"rA r. Spangler, if ever a lan was
hated by woman, you have been since
we first met. But I am wrong; you
are doing your duty honestly, I ai
the sport of nisfortune. I an blocked
at my own game, and intend like a
woman to subnit."
'There's an honest shake, i\lrs. IHal.
He extended a great, iron muscled
hand. Sne took it.
''I am you friend. Leave all to me!
Thank you, I'll dink   the rest of
the coflee !'  She poured the collee im
his cup.
"Just ('on:1a11(l m1e; we all get
crooked now and then."' he 11honest
scout felt better than if lie had captur-
ed a score oft1 ankees.
"Perhaps," she said, ''you nay be

Her voice trembled as the rears
swelled to her eyes.
"The uncertainty of my own social
standing in consequence ! The con-
tempt cast on me as a farm out,-all
goaded me to one end. Brantly was
the victim sought especially, although
I had aimed a less venomed shaft at
another of the family. He was poor
game. I could humble no one through
him. Failing to accomplish my pur-
pose with the first, I aimed at the
higher mark. He has suffered. We
have both suffered. The end is not
yet, Chris Spangler ! I loathed you
yesterday, you are my confidant to-
day. Look upon me as a woman
driven here and yonder by a storm
of wrathful vengance, and-know me
hereafter as you must have known, if
even my worst traducer spoke it, as
(excepting my aimless blunders and
foolish ventures) the one against
whom a criminal aspersion does not
hint."I
"Friends we are Ual! Be calm!
I have said all will come right. So
it will. Do not refer to any of this
again unless I ask it. I only shall, if
to help you. But let me urge you to
treat Brantly as a friend."
"I shall be pleasanter."
She turned and walked deep into the
wooded retreat. Spangler thought, to
weep.
Satisfied that the movements of the
Federals did not lie on the road they
desired to ride, Chris started the little
party when all were refreshed.
At night fall he had crossed safely
and was within the Confederate lines.
Brantly returned at once to his com-
mand. The scout waved a brief adieu
and rode on with his fair charge. Ar-
riving at the first house whichextern-
ally wore a comfortable appearance,
he dismounted and bluffly started his
wish.

"Excuse General Stuart's scout. He
desires entertainment for a lady in
distress, but no' longer than she can
get to Richmond.
Can you kindly afford her protec-'
tion?"
"Anything for Jeb Stuart or his!
Tell the lady to come in."
She was assisted from the saddle in
which she had been many hours.
"Good night ! I   hope you'll rest
well."
He shook hands with the captive
who relinquished her bridle rein and
entered the house. Chris rode to
camp leading Count by the side of
Rocket.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE ORPHAN COUSIN.
Ralph had started on leave for lbome.
He had written concerning the ex-
pected visit. On the evening of the
night he  was expected, his mother,
Mrs St Clair, and Pearl were seated
at the centre table occupying the
anxious interval before his coining.
"The train reaches Woodside at an
inconvenient hour-nine    at  night;
Ralph will not get home until eleven,
even if Scip pushes the ponies."
Pearl with an involuntary glance
consulted the clock, but made no reply.
Her white tapering fingers wrn lt

dered work. The martial representa.
tion  was    caring  completion. A
soldier in gray     sping a flag, the
staff of which was I-tly shot away.
He was hewing his way through an
a/batis of bayonets. Underneath, a
dis ounted cannon lay on the flank
of a dying   horse. The rider still
gr sped the reins, as he fell stark
across another dead man. In fr i lt,

the smoke. Behind, other horsemen
urging foaming mouthed horses to the

"Almost ready, is it not dear?" en-
quired the elder.
"An hour more Aunt, will finish it."
Pearl replied, raising the frame.
"It is a model of skill and patience
Pearl ! And so painfully true to life.
My son is still safe !  Before we re-
tire, or rather I should say you, let us
return thanks."
"I am too ready to join you, Aunt!
Now, or when I have finished?" The
lovely face looked up for a reply.
"When you have finished, Pearl
Ralph must see that complete."
Mrs St Clair did not suspect or she
would have seen a rich blush on her
nikee's cheeks.
"Howard was here to day when I
rode over to Mr Mowbray's I believe."
"Yes, he called. He has been at home
a month now. He says the army being
in winter quarters, he has sixty days
leave."
Pearl wrought on.
"The clerks have an easy time! No
danger, good pay, snug beds, abun.
dant leave of absence, ah well ! I
want Ralph where he is. Let all be
selected as Fortunio in the fairy tale,
each for his varied gifts."
Pearl smiled as she heartily en-
drsed her aunt's patriotic remark,
but made no reply.
She was equally    related to the
soldier and the clerk.
Mrs St Clair had slipped away to
smooth the pillow another time, to Jay
the counterpane   back  again !  T1

to see as only a mother can, tha
everything was mathematically exac

with buried head, ou the Coif ,rtabl
stuffed chair, in which her husband
had so often   sat, there to coinu i
with the great Ruler of nations an
men.
We have an opportunity ofstud'

ing Pearl's appearance as she sat with
a finger against her cheek while her
head rested on the closed palm of the
white hand. Slightly above the petite;
rounded to exquisite delicacy of figure,
clad  in a dark brown dress with a
plain collar esca ping the pure neck as
a dividing line, between the sottue s
of a snow bank and a (lark contrast of
brown beneath it. Shell like ears, so
coy and small, peeping out of t mass
of brown hair that curled coquetishly
on her neck and cheeks, in spite of
comb and lbraided restraints. Lips
ripe and strung with love's most ar-
rowy shafts. Eyes; well-t were not
safe to catch their gentle vestal light,
unless to own the charm. Such was
Pearl, Ralph's cousin.
The orphaned Pearl, )affte(/( of one
who was a mother in care and devo-

Ralph would soon he at home. I icr
every thought was of him, and yet she
reproached herself.

were no impediment to the easy jump
he made at the call, "Woodside!"
Looking eagerly into the darkness,
he saw a figure approaching from a
fire that intensified the night.
"Is dat Mars Ralph?    Lor bless
you soul, my noung boss!  How you
do? How duz you do?"
A happy young slave about the age
of the master was working Ralph's
gauntleted hand like a pump handle.
"I'm  first rate, Scip; first rat?.
How is mother?"
"She am tolerol, Mars Ralph, an
mouty jubersome bout dis yer railroad

"Sez I, Mistress, ef dat ar train
comes to time like her orter, you'll
hab Mars Ralph     yer by   twelve
o'clock-an--"
"Hold on, Scip!"
Ralph saw that his favorite slave
was about to gratify the habit of his
race, a redundant garrulousness which
he'd take later on the drive.
"How is Miss Pearl?"

"Scip, how is Miss Pearl?"
"Enty I was gwine to tell you, boss.
Miss Pearl!"
The good natured slave, with the
freedom of a humored playmate, hesi-
tated.
"She am, sar, purtier dan she ebber
was afo."
He took the bundle.

"Come on, Mars Ralph; de ponies
is gwine to do two forty for home."
Ralph jumped in and for practise'
sake took the lines.
'Old Scip, sends howdye to you."
"Tank you sir!  I 1 as gwine to ax
you bout daddy tomor ow, arter I git
tru wid we own bizness.  He day wid
Mars Leo all de time, sar?"
"Yes," replied Ralph, "he likes
camp life."
"Taint much gun round day, way
he is I spec, Mars Ralph."
Young Scip saw a reason for his
father's contentment.
"They stand around in tents, stack.
ed outside like corn ricks; men use'
them for walking sticks.  In fact we
don't handle .anything ele."
"Lor a mussy! Daddy must he an-
oder man    from  de ole time Scip.
Lem stay day, lem stay!"
Young Scipio (with the invariable
peculiarity, bred upon a feeling of
reverence and dependence to the
master, common to all well cared fir
slaves) would probably not have al-
luded to his father at all.  As his
Young master saw fit to indroduce the
subject, he gave it a passing notice
This was not owing to any want of
filial regard.  On the contrary, like
all children of well ordered slaves, he
loved his father loyally, but it wails
enough that an  affectionate, faithful
master was in the land. To a good
servant it was his quantum su ficit.
"Yaas sar! Hebben! I'se proud for

tress to-night. Dem creeters is a doing

"What is that Scip?  Say it over
again."
Ralph lit a segar as he enjoyed the
circumlocutory, rambling jabber.

The negro joined in the hearty
laugh.
"Dot is so, sar. Now dese creeters

"Oh stupid, shut up, or I'll make

"Well, sar, we driv ober yisterday

Constant -visitor, thought Ralph.
Who can tell but that he may   suc-
ceed?  So the time flew by.
The ponies wheeled into the car-
riage drive, sped by the fish pond and
center plo; just  as  the   "whoa"
was uttered, Ralph sprang and folded
his mother in his arms.
For several seconds the sobbing
heart of the mother beat in unison to
the gentle patting of the son's hand
on her shoulder.  Passing her arm
through his, the two entered the sit-
ting room.
"Where's Pearl, mother?"
"It was so late, Ralph, I asked her

to go to bed. Here, she has prepared
a nice meal for you."
"Many thanks for her kindness.
It is a nice meal!  Bless her little
hands and heart!"
Ralph relished the savory supper,
but could not repress the thought:
She might have waited to meet me!
After the late supper, with his
mother's consent, he lit a pipe.  A
rambling conversation ran on until
two o'clock, when a kiss was set on
Ralph's forehead then he retired to
rest.
Pearl was astir early, yet hesitated
about coming to the breakfast room
before  the usual hour.   She had
heard the whining (playfulness of Zell
and Videau as theft leaped upon their
master and bounded away ready fr a
hunt.   She heard the lively whistle
of an aria of which Ralph was special-
ly fond. She knew he had traversed
the horse lot, strolled  to the  negro
cabins, walked around the garden.
Since the first peep of (lay, she had
been awake with a restless concern or
the arrival of her cousin, which seem-
ed to challenge the ownership o her
heart and mind. She desired to meet
him, yet shrank from it.
The bell for morning devotion was
rung.   Ralph   entered the hall as
Pearl reached the bottom step of tn
stairway.   Ile sprang to her and (1'
she  could  resist him, sie was in hr
arms and a burning kiss was on her
lips.
The salutation, even   front her
favorite cousin, astonished her. h

if I say, I did not expect you to over-
whelm   me.   Now I mean no harm.
Don't be angry! You were not so
demonstrative before."
She let her hand remain.
"Perhaps not!" he said sadly: "Nor
have I been so long from home, from
you, before. Nor did I expect to see
such a -. Oh well, we'll not quar-
rel little cousin.
The prayer bell has called us."
He escorted her in on his arm.
Mrs. St. Clair led the worship.
Ralph watched his mother as she
read and prayed. To him that moth-
er was all that a perfect being could
attain.  Dignified, she commanded
respect even from the humblest neigh-
bor, who seeing her pass by, would
say: "She's a queen among women."
Courteous - to the   poorest slave.
"Mistress is we mudder an ebry-
ting," vauntingly boasted her negroes.
Still comely even at fifty, her courtly
brother said at a receipton given for
the parish poor, "Sister, you surpass
the room in your calicodress. Every-
thing becomes you as you become
everything."
Mrs St. Clair desired to set an ex-
ample to arrest ostentation, remark-
ing: "The poor we have always; let
us ndt parade the  lisproportione ts
of better things we may be blessed
with, to offend."  She was devout,
and as a mother and a true church-
woman, she required honor first, to be
rendered to her Master.  'he com.
manl and thy plr)rJeid,se he held sacred,
"to thousands of them  that love me
and keep mIy commniandriments"
The sound's head bowed reverently.
His lips re1afted "arme" when the

sikt (rheek  Tit, with
lordly gsallanry, he r ered  with firm to

each  of the  ladies on   the way to
breakfast.
"Cousin," said  Ralph,    pushing
away the plate, "the ponies are spoil-
ing for exercise.  They brought the
buggy along last night by the hit.
Will you join me in a canter alter
awhile?"
Pearl hesitated  only  a moment.
The face was whiter than was wont as
she replied:
"Yes, I will enjoy it, I think."
"Good; I'll see that your saddle is
double girthed. The fillies are frisky."
He left to superintend the prepara-
tion of the horses.  Pearl was ready
in due   time.   She stood in a navy
blue habit, with a delicate feather o
white in her beaver, and a riding
whip at her wrist as the horses were
led up.    Ralph walked briskly, fol-
lowed by the dogs. Soon they were
in saddle and away. The ride was
along the road that led to the Craw-
ford's.  The  young   ladies  bowed
very stiffly as they passed.
"Who is the gentleman seated there?
He is so protected by both the girls I
don't see him."
Pearl recognized the horse at the
hitching rack.
"It is Howard!" she replied.
"Pity he did not change his outfit;
a man who never smelt saltpetre
should not insult a gray uniform?'
"You are severe Ralph ! May he
not be wanted where he is?"
Ralph turned as if to question the
necessity of the defence.
"Yes, he can write the roll of the
dead or the rolls of those to be
numbered   with the dead.   There's
somiCthing in that. It has to be done
I guess. -Je'll nor, like Roderigo, iln-
continently - drown  himself, norhe
ilmnolated on the altar of his countr-.
He'll accept Iago's gist of ad. ice, if

not  literally !  If  he  must needs
damn himself (excuse the quotation
cousin) he'll do it in a more delicate
way than on the battle field."
'I am sorry Ralph, that you judge
so har hly of Howard !  He speaks so
differently of you."
"My pretty cousin, I am sorry that
Howard sees fit to speak, of me at all.
Seneca's aphorism suits him exactly
'Tar  turpe tibi sit laudari.'  Let it
be a disgrace to be, praised by the
vile, &amp;c. I cannot regard Howard as
any  other than a hypocrite. I am
sorry my blood is in his veins, so I'll
dismiss him."
No more was said of the Bureau
clerk soldier. They had reached the
river. The old mill was closed, but
the slashing water tumbled and trick-
led  from  the  wheel.  A. few tame
ducks enjoyed the stream. The day
was balmy and southern. The ponies
had galloped off the excess of live and
stood quiet. Pearl was enjoying the
placid river.
Her unloved    hand rested on the
pommel. Ralph reached over, caught
the hand and pressed it to his lips.
She turned and with a sad tone

said,
"sa1lph, I shall not ride again with
you, unless you promise, not to repeat
this liberty !"
"Liberty,   Pearl !"  he  returned.
"Do you know? if you do not, I will
tell you, that I love you above all wo-
men excepting my mother. Sweet cousin
repel me not! I prayed that I might
soon enjoy your society, am I to be)
disappointed?"
Pearl gasped with excitement.
"Ralph, Ralph! this is unjust! I
cannot hear it.. Let us ride.   What
would aunt say?" she burst to tears.
Ah   well !  Forgive  me Pearl; I
shall not offend you again. Dry your
tears. Let us ride back."

The way home was resuied in a
walk. Ralph did not heed the dogs
as both stood at a point near a covey
of birds in the brush. le rode on in
silence.  Had   Howard supplanted
him! Could Pearl love such a man?
Such torturing thoughts flew excited-
ly through his brain. They reached
the avenue of oaks that led to the
home place. All was quiet; not a
glint of sunlight touched the drive, so
dense was the moss and leaves even of
late winter, that clung to the nuillion
interlaced  arms and  sprays.  T1
even patter of the ponies' hoos roused
Ralph. He turned. and faced his
cousin.
"Pearl, can I ollend this much, (ear
girl? I am home to love and to hope
Your letters have been of late strange-

inevitable. But, how can I give you'
up?"
He drew up suddenly at the same
time touching the bridle reins of her
pony.
"One kiss sweet Pearl, if 'tis to be
the last."
The sobbing girl shook her head
sadly but firmly.
"No, dear cousin; end the doubtful
matter here, 'tis best; you'll find it so."
The ride continued on in silence.
 Mrs St Clair wondered when a
little later she heard, "Down, Zell!
confound the dog."
What could have affected Ralph's
usual fondness for the pets?
Pearl remained all morning in her
chamber.
Ralph wandered about the planta-
tionttaking a very doubtful interest in
anything.
Had the cousins disagreed?
Mrs St Clair did not suspect that
her son was in love with his cousin.
Dinner passed as usual, except that
neither of the young people was very
sprightly.
"Aunt !" said Pearl, "I have not
returned Eva Crawford's call, with
your consent, I would like to drive
over and see her this afternoon."
"Certainly, child." The mother's
eyes were directed to Ralph.
"If you don't mind being alone
mother until dark, I'll take PearL over."
Ralph rang the bell, and ordered
the buggy.
The drive to the Crawford's was trot-
ted inside of a half hour. Pearl and
Ralph entered the reception room-a
handsomely   furnished  aparten t,
opening  on   a pretty greenhouse
Ralph opened the inevitable picture
album; among familiar faces there, he
saw the photograph of IHoward. with
the subscription,  he     umble
se iteur."

The album was closed with a snap
and pushed aside.
"Quick, Chloe, you stupid! The
day is short; 'twill soon go."
Eva Crawford was wild with ex-
citement.   Ralph had called during
his first day  at home.    He had
brought Pearl along.   That meant,
of course, that he was not very anx-
ious to have his cousin's company ex-
clusively. Why should he?      She's
only passe , poor withal.
The Crawford's counted slaves with
the St. Clairs.
"There; go down and say I am
coming."
A   grand  sweep of inspection le-
tween two mirrors, a studied charm of'
expression, then the fine looking Eva
Crawford rustled to the presence of
the visitors.
"Captain! Oh excuse the impule
to honor the soldier! Ralph, my old
friend, I am cha-rmed to see you saL'
and looking so well."
The gushing greeting verballywa
not more expressive than the tangible
evidence attending it in the clasp of
the hand.
Miss Eva's grip would have done
credit to a clever ball tosser.
"You are looking as bright as in
lang syne.   No lack of fresh air. I
see.  That's right, Miss Eva, keep
the color on thecheek.  You  merit
the neat anaplest:
'On the warm cheek of youth,
Smiles and roses are blendiu ".'
Pearl remained in the coservatory.
Her eyes turned close to a calla to
hide a laugh.  Ralph had   flattered
Tetlow's gossamer and Lubins reg
"There's the sweet pe-arl.  You
dear, mean little cheat! Howd ye."
A   smacking   kiss exploded  on)
Pearl's ripe lips, as she cotnsented to
be imbraced by the lively Eva.
"The fuchsias are belling  charm-

Eva had plucked a dainty bouquet
and wound the stem with tinsel paper
and silver thread. A blue ribband
completed the nosegay.
"You must be perfectly happy that

Pearl as they still lingered among the

"Aunt is very    happy,"  replied
Pearl.
eaie's impro-ved so, hasn't he?"
"He's looking well," replied Pearl.-
On entering where Ralph sat, heI
was made the recipient of the pretty
boo q et.
"Thanks, Miss Eva!    The winter
has not harmed your pet: "
No,indee-d!  I take too good care
of all that falls under my supervision
to neglect even a pot plant."
The benevolent landation of sef
sounded much like a hint. (I'll take
good care of you.)
Miss Carrie Crawford, a girl of six-
teen, came in, at any rate with honest
solid steps, if a shade hoydenish, and
walking bluff up to Ralph, extended
a warm   hand, with, 'howdye do,

Eyeing Eva with curious comcrn,
the younger took a seat to be a spectat or.
The older members of the house-

A whinny from one of the ponies

He said: "Cousin, I am  about to

"Tell Aunt, please, that I'll redeeni
my debt to Eva, and  not he   home

"At the Crawford's, and will re-
main there until Friday."
Mrs St. Clair saw now that trouble
was brewing.
"Excuse me a moment, Ralph!"
She went to Pearl's room.
All was as usual, in excellent
order. A note addressed "To Aunt"
stuck in the glass of Pearl's dressing
bureau.
Mrs St. Clair read it and returned
to her son.
"Now, Ralph, if I can assist you,
confer freely. What can I do?"
The mother affectionately' took his
hand.
"Explain to me, dear mother, why
a girl of Pearl's advantages and rear-
ing should throw herself away on a
fellow like Howard.  She has flatly
refused  me.   I almost wish she had
never known the sneak."
"Don't be over severe, Ralph. I
have not the least idea that Pearl
would favor Howard."
Ralph's face brightened.
"Are you impressed with that be-
lief, mother?"
-'I am," she replied.
"I am rejoiced to bear you say so.
Well, why do you think she refuses
me?" he asked impatiently.
"Suppose Ralph! that, I was penni-
less and under the care of the kindest
of relatives. Suppose . that for every
attention, every act of unselfish love
I gave back    hearty  exchanges of
loyal devotion and sympathy. Sup-
pose. that where I was, under the
roof, to all purposes maternal, there
was a suitor whose wealth placed him
at least above rue pecuniarily; what
would you expect of me, if I were thus
situated, to do?"
"Refuse the offer at once!'' re)lied1
Ralph.
Mrs St Clair smiled and handed
her son the letter which she bad found.

Ralph read, "What is duty dearest
aunt and mother, when some circurm-
stances interpose, is a terrible question
for an inexperienced girl to decide.
My duty, first and truthfully glad to
render, has been to serve you as I, a
well cared. for beneficiary may; as
your child should. My duty always
will be, Heaven helping, to render
that homage that filial gratitude for
unmerited kindnesses only can feel.
And yet ! (the blistered paper told the
struggle) my duty is to leave your
home for awhile.  I cannot consent to
remain, while my cousin Ralph is on
furlough.  Why?   Because, he forgets
that, I am a depend':l;t orphan ! He
does not wait the opportunity of ob-
taining a matrimonial equality which
I cannot give.   My cousin is noble!
He is as dear to me as a brother, too
dear for me to put at any disadvan-
tage. A little time and he will forget
me, then I will be free to know, that
no suspicion could be laid at my door,
that I accepted an offer which a too
charitable nature made to me while a
dependent on the bounty of him who
offered. Even the womanly appre-
ciation of a courtship (which under
ordinary circumstances is received as
a compliment) fails me entirely. The
distance between my noble cousin and
myself increases as my poverty is
more conspicuous. I knew it not, un-
til he had invited me to be, what
providence has decreed against. So
construe my absence in all kindness
and charity dearest aunt and mother!
You, at least, will endorse the act, if
regretting the time and occasion.
Pearl."
"What a high strung woman !" said
Ralph, fbldimig the letter: ""She is a
Pearl indeed of no mean price.  (w
mother, what next?"
"ofheis our own blood Ralph ! Full
of right views of propriety.   You

Ralph caught his mother's hand
as he saw a new light where dark-
ness had lately been.
Immediately  after dinner on the
next day, the ponies did good service
again. Ralph jumped    out at the
Crawfbrds and was met in the parlor
by Miss Eva. Her manner was acci-
dental.
"I had stolen away from the girls
Captain, to practice some neglected
music, little dream-ing of this pleasure;
I am so glad to see you, sit &amp;0e161"1
Ralph made himself at home.
"I enjoyed Pearl's visit so much
last night; we slept together. She's a
sly little duck. Do you know, I
couldn't get a word out of her about.-
ah    "
Miss Eva dropped her eyelashes
very pensively.
"About what Miss?" asked Ralph.
"Fie on you    both!  You know!
Who'd come all the way from Vir-
ginia except to see somebody!'
"I came all the way, but if it was
to see anyone more interested in me
than mother, I haven't yet found it
out. Perhaps Miss Eva may be able
to tell more than I know."
Ralph rose to watch the gold fish
in the aquarium.
"You are both excusable.  I told
Pearl as much last night.  Love i
non-committal.  She laughed me ou
of countenance because I hinted sueI
a thing, and went so far as to sa:
that the compliment, if any, was pai(

Miss Eva cast a tender glance t(
wards Ralph.V
"Who? do tell. I am in for a con

''C'onfession! That's after the act!

"Haven't I what?  You ladies he-

Ralph was half inclned to a llirta-
tioni, the fruit seemed so ripe.
"A re you able, Captain St. Clai-r
to sit, ther-e and say you are an un-

''Prisoner look on the juryman! I

She met Howard     cordially, then
walking to Ralph, said:
"How is Aunt?"
"Very well. She sends a message.
May I he excused for a few moments?"
Bowing, he retired to the adjoining
apartment used as an ordinaire, the
large sliding doors of which made
both rooms private.
"That cur is enough to sicken a
man."
"Ralph! Ralph!!"
At the same moment in the next
room, Howard had drawn quite near
to Eva and was engaging the young
lady's ear with delectable sentiments,
all of which she received in good faith
and gladly.

"Said what?" eagerly enquired the

"That I must tell you   "
"Ralph, I meant no harm to aunt

all." (She thought the note had been
o'v erlooked.)
"She told me Pearl, to tell vou:

"'Tell it Ralph, oh tell it !" eried
the weeping cousin.
"That you were right to decline ie

cousin, I am your inferior in worth,
generosity, nobility, everything. Take
me as I am, my darling Pearl, and let
all my life say, how happy I will he."
Her head fell on his shoulder. His
arm encircled her. The kiss was not
withheld; nor two, nor three ! Her
plump little arm encircled his neck.
They were one.
"There; let us   ack to the pJarlor,
and then for h ie."
Pearl ra    up to Eva's chamber
bathed her face and was soon hack.
bonneted for the ride.
"What means this Pearl?" enquired
Miss Eva, whose frills next to Howard
had a crumpled appearance.
"Going so soon?"
"Aunt desires me at home ! I'll
make lip for this another time."
"And you Captain, when may we
expect you again?"
"Possibly, said Ralph, "before 1
leave."
"Don't be in a hurry about leaving;

"It is not inexcusable sometimes, to
forego the plucking of the bauble re.

the average chance."

Miss Eva had gathered another ex-
quisite hon quet, which with graceful
aptitude she pinned on the sol(liers

he took a look at the duplicateon his

"The cynosure !"   Whether Eva

On the way home, Pearl had asked
leave to drive. Ralph with unusual
care had  a strong   arm  around her
waist to prevent her being thrown out,
perhaps. The unfortunate     nosegay
was immolated on the wearer's breast
because it was sillily  between the
young lovers.
The fragrant pine forests seemed to
breathe a  cadence   of  heneditive
whisperings. So   curiously  did the
blue birds and jays look sideways as
the pony phaeton slowly rolled by. So
proudly did the fillies toss their heads.
So peacefully did the nearby mill
stream  plash, as it telling to the flag-
ged banks a secret. Pearl held the
lines, and Ralph held Pearl.
Pearl's head sometimes lay on R alph's
breast. Ralph's heart lay at Pearl's feet
They had forgotten everything sav

The faithful slave had given Chris
a clear outline if the eventful affair.
He saw that Hais ideas of revenge
bad swept her past remedy unless
Howard was made to acknowledge the
fmt marriage.
Now for the clearing up, he thought,
if such is possible.
What ensued in Hal's childhood to
embitter her life ! Who could better
tell it than Brantly's sister, if it was
to be told at all.
A few days elapsed after the recital
mentioned, Ralph reported for duty.
Chris applied for leave of absence; it
was granted.
He called on Hal at once, and an-
nounced the object of his visit.
"My friend;" began he, "I have a
favor to ask, at the same time you are
free to reject the offer if you please."
"It  is  only  necessary Captain
Spangler, to state it, I shall not tax
your patience with indecision," re-
plied Hal frankly.
"To give you a permit to recross
our lines will compromise both Brant-
ly and me beyond estimate. I pro-
pose securing you a pleasant home
until the war is over, then you are at
liberty to go where you desire. My
object is twofold. First, to have Col
Brantly's reputation as a soldier free
from the aspersion of releasing you
without a trial, next to clear up the
mystery of your sipp ed    wrongs.

Seldom did the scout obtrude on her

upon her frequently as he sat smne
distance behind.
Once he advanced to inquire it she
needed anything.
He found a Bible in her hanus.
Her finger rested on the verse:
"Better is a handful with tuietness,
than both the hands full with travail
and vexation of spirit."
She looked up.  A great tear tood
in either eye.

father's interest, of which he was de-
prived when he abandoned the state
and took me away."
"Your father's name was-?"
"Armour," replied Hal promptly.
"Eugene  Armour.     I have a vague
recollection of him.  So  indistinct
however, that I can recall only a rest-
less, handsome man, full of company
address and humor."
Still in the dark, thought Chris.
She thinks herself an Armour.   She
is a Prentiss.  Well, I shall not un-
deceive her yet.
"Now, to   be  candid, my    little
friend," said Chris, "I shall go, with
your consent, very near to the same ac-
quaintances of your father.    You
may rest assured though, that no com-
promise of your feelings will be per-
mitted by me. Should I find that the
least. tinge of unpleasantness is likely
to occur either way, it will he easy to
change the direction to other parts I
am determined to see this  misuuder-
standing to the bottom, and afford all
parties a chance to make amends"
"So satisfied am I, that you  will
fail Captain, that I rather dread th(
re-action.  What if I am constrained
to denounce  those who blighted m
child life, and broke my mother'
heart?"
Chris touched the book on whiel
her hand rested.
"It suffereth long and is kind."
"I shall try to exercise charity, hu

Pearl looked after the house during
the talk.
"By   accident,  madam;   in the
various adventures of my calling, I
fell upon certain matters that connect
your family with another. The inter-
course may or may not be acceptable,
nor must you suppose for an instant
that I have any object in view beyond
assisting one to unravel a complica-
tion, which if permitted to remain will
be an impediment during all life to his
welfare. With your consent, I will
request such information as will be of
advantage. The family of Prentiss I
refer to. Some of them are yet alive?"
"Captain;" replied the lady, her
face evincing much contempt. "That
name for over twenty years has been
inhibited on every tongue with us.
How much of sorrow has ensued since
first t'was mentioned in our home is
best held in the voiceless graves where
innocency lies buried ! I could not
consent to know aught of them for
reasons you may imagine."
"True   madam ! Let all that is
buried so remain. Its sacredness shall
not be disturbed ! Only for the liv-
ing do I speak. The living are not
exempt now, but may be hereafter
from the errors of the dead."
"to whom do you refer?"
"To my best of friends, Leo Brant-
ly.  I wish to aid him."
"Speak on Captain," continued the
lady, "but excuse any expression o
abhorrence I may evince for a dis
graced name."
"Who was Eugene Armour Pren
Liss?" enquired Chris respectfully.
"Relying   on  your friendship fo
my brother Leo, I will give you th
history of this man-the Iliad of ou
woes.   Before my marriage, Mr Clif
ford St Clair, afterwards my husband
and Ralph's father, once on his return
from  college  brought with    him

chum.   Eugene Prentiss was a show ,
wealthy, young Marylander about the
same age as his friend. It will hr
necessary to the proper explanation t'
later events, that a few details he
mentioned in explanation of our con.
fidence and his baseness."
"The steamers for our landing were
weekly, and it was necessary that we
should make the trip by boat fronm
Charleston as the day of departure to
the plantation did not suit the steamer.
Our family boat was large and fast.
Eight fine fellows sat on the henches
The day was glorious. Clifford, his
chum and I sat under the awning (I har
finished a seminary course in Charles-
ton and was returning home under
Clifford's care). Crossing the Ashley
for the cut, the view of the city was
lovely.' Venice in her golden splendor
could not excel the sight of vine-chad
gables, trellised balconies, and flower-
decked walls. St Michael's stood out
symmetrical and white with its flash-
ing batelike a jewel in the sun. South
battery gardens were rich in April
green. The lively harbor and shim-
merigw aters added   to the scene.
Eugene Prentiss was charmed, and
 extolled everything  extravagantly.
As we entered the cut, the boat was

argument too conclusive in favor of
the match.
Alice consented.
They were engaged only four days,
when he told her he must return home,
and urged a secret marriage, to be
ratified later with his parent's ap-
proval.
Poor thing, she yielded.
Here is the proof of the wed-ling:
Mrs St. Clair touched a plain ring
on her hand.
"He abandoned her. Alice gave birth
to a girl, a comely infant, and left it to
jgr parents as she sank to the grave."
"You have no doubt, madalm, as to
the sacredness of the marriage?" en-
quireQ sthe scout.,
"None -2.t all!  I have since con-
versed  with the minister who per-
formed the ceremony.
Within two years the child was
abducted, and has never been heard
of since. Eugene Prentiss n(ow enters
on a new role.   He renounces the
name of Prentiss and assumes that of
Eugene Armour. E. A rmnour Fren-
tiss was the correct name.
Eugene   Armour, still handsome
as unprincipled, endeavors to ac-
quire a competency by villainy, his
father having cut off his entail.
He makes the acquaintance of my
younger sister whohad never met hiln
before, at school in Baltimore. After
months of persistent attention, with
his usual persuasive powers, he marries
her as Eugene   Armour.    Imagine
our disgust when the base husband of
the late deserted Alice Roften, through
an attorney, (for l1e ared not bring
his wife to our home) demanded   in
the name of E. A. Prentiss his dead
wife's estate.
The poor thing lived little longer
than  the first wife, scarcely three
years. She had learned his deception

and past history and pined away iln
solitude. She was the mother of two
children-a boy and a girl.  These I
learned were knowc n oily by the as
sumed name.
'rhe girl is our sweet Pearl, whtnrl
you saw this morning. The boy was
taken by the father. I have never
heard of the child since.
Prentiss soon  gambled   away his
wife's property and took to questioin-
able pursuits.  He was killed in a
duel with a lawyer named Cleapor
about 1847.   The cause, a gambler's
trick while playing with gentlemen.
Such is the history of him whose
memory we detest."
"Madam," said Chris, "the revela-
tion you make confirms several points
of my investigation.   The   lawyer,
Mr Cleapor, has very recently enter-
tained your brother.  He  is Judge
Cleapor-is living just on the Poto-
mac border.
So  the pretty  Pearl is Prentiss's
child! Is Pearl in?" he asked.
"I shall see."
Mrs St. Clair arose and soon after
returned.
"She is out at the greenhouse. May
I call her?"M
"No, madam, please!   Now for my
Pa  of the story.    Hal Prentiss,
Pearl's sister, is at the station.  She
is depressed and in trouble. Brantly
and I have her in custody because of
violating military rules. Of course,
she inherited her father's side of the
question. May I put her under your
care?'
Mrs. St. Clair sat stupified  with
surprise.
"Yes! I'll do all T can for her."
"Will ''ou withhol the fact fr m
her  unti  the  propermiearrives,
that she is Pearl's sister?  Do I ask
too mc h?s           - (    I yu r
"Of col rse, I shall doa   o  e

The anticipation of having a com
panion was quite gratifying to lPearl
She asked:
"When will she arrive?"
"To-night," replied the aunt.
Thus Pearl in utter ignorance of
the relationship waited the coning o
the stranger lady.
Hal sat alone after the departure o
the scout.  A torrent of though t

quest," replied the lady.
"Will you refrain from alluding to
the cause of her arrest, unless she
opens the way?"
"As you desire "
4 yamtoo happy, my dear friend,"
said  Chris.  "I shall go and rally
Pearl a little, then return to my
charge.   She will   be with you to-
night."
The scout entered   the greenhouse
laughing.   He   felt as  though he
knew Pearl for years. Teasingly he
recited the ditty:
"which eyes most win at evening
And which most dazzle in the hall?
And which bespeak the lively heart,
And which will force the sulden start?
Or which the long life flames betray.
Or which are brightest night or day?'
"Ralph would say yours. There,
peace! I shall not say another word."
He gave his hand. Pearl smiled
as he said:
"You'll see me again this evening."
Mrs St Clair  prepared   Pearl Ir
the visit after this manner:
"A lady, who on account of the
war has had much annoyance, is in
the care and under the direction fo1
the present of your uncle and his
friend, Capt. Spangler.  I have con-
sented to receive her as a guest. We
must be careful, dear Pearl, to avoid
any reference to her private history,
except as she may invite it.  Should
you find her agreeable, you may, i
you prefer, take her in  your  c1am-
ber."

threatened her mind, but with a hero-
ism worthy of a Joan Iachette, she
cast some thoughts aside, examined
others, meditated on some, or repudi-
ated others, evincing a superb poise of
command by which the citadel of self
was hers, if rudely stormed  by con-
fliting outside circumstances.
V hat means all this tacit assent I
an giving   to the course of events,
since the memorable night at the llen-
thami cottage?   Why are the waters
of Mara so lately bitter, sweetening to
the lip of humility?  h1ad  Brantly
lay stark before me, (innocent as he
was) the wrongs of my mother would
have enabled me once. calmly to have
said, tis best.  Could I have driven a
bullet through [she omitted the nanel

clutch, how flatteringly w io(ld I have

She pressed her temples as if in

"All is changed.   I In dd Brantly
no ill will. N ay, I feel, y"es, I regret

enigma, as you have always been.'
Why an enigma? Have I no record
that will bear the light of day?
Am I as Erasmus wrote of another,
cursed if I am, and cursed if I am
not?"
So went and came the filtered
thoughts all night.
She was sitting next day at the
window and saw the tall scout gallop-
ing up.
He holds his head up cheerfully,
she thought.  Yes, but he is as un-
readable as a Sphynx.  He may be
on a fruitless search.  She heard his
tramp down stairs, on the stairway;
his rap at the door.
"Come in," she said.
He stood before her, cap in hand.
"How did my litttle friend pass the
night?"  he  asked, extending  his
hand.
"Thank you, Captain. I had some
rest. Sit, please."
He drew a chair.
"Well, you will be surprised to
know that I have seen Col. Brantly's
only sister and a niece.  Two ladies
the very types of hospitality and re-
finement."
Hal was ghostly pale, and as silent.
"You are, my little friend, to be
the companion of the younger, and
the beneficiary of the elder for so long
a time as you desire. Doing any
service to relieve the embarrassment
of dependence, or not, as you please:'!
Still no reply.
"As to any conditions, there are
none for you to accept. You go there
as my friend, and with my assurance,
that Brantly approves of what I do.
Mrs St. Clair opens her door and
arms to you."
"She is very kind, Captain, but
does she know  who I am?    Could
you desire to insult her with the
presence ofan enemy in her family?

How practically  impossible!   How
great the presumption on your part!
Let not zeal overstep discretion."
"Hal, (excuse me, dear lady, I for-
got myself) Mistress Hal, neither you
nor she entirely knows who you are.
She is as mystified as you. Both are
partly right and partly in the dark.
Don't ask   me at once to bring the
golden fleece of ransom.  The  bulls
and dragons are yet in my way, but
the daughter of Etes will lend her aid."
He spoke cheerfully to comfcrt her.
"We shall win!   Hal, I only want
your confidence.   You   are brave.
Let us fight this trouble down. Trust
me. I shall neither deceive nor hum-
ble you. What say you?"
He leaned over anxiously watching
her
"If what she does not know, is put
with what I do know, will there be a
hope of light?  I cannot lend myself
to an experiment at the expense of
hospitality."
She looked anxiously at the strong
man. A look that seemed to say, I
dare trust you, -yet why should I."
"Yes; but I have a condition to
exact if you accept ! You are to be
the guest !  Wait for developments.
Time will unfold them. If active
energy can push time, I will promise
the energy. To turn back now Hal,
is to take your feet from the thresh-
hold of a door of refuge.  You doubt
what ! Your own name,?"
"No;" she said, springing to her
feet. Leave me sir! I am of honor-
able birth if-."
"You, are deceived as to your name
Hal! Your birth is honorable.   Be
calm. I pledge my honor for both
the statements I make ! Sit down."
Hal slowly took her chair trembling
with excitement.
"Not Hal Armour?" she asked,
with great tears in her eyes.

brother was your father. It is an assum-
ed name you wear ! In other words,
for reasons to be later given, your
father dropped the name you are en-
titled to and employed the surname.
His christian appellation was Eugene
Armour Prentiss."
"Honestly sir, on the honor of a
man, and in response to the prayer of
a woman thrice stabbed, can I claim
lawfully any name?"
Hal placed her hand on his arm.
Her lustral eyes seemed to search to
the core of his being. A sublime
despair raised her above the sickly
prudishness of affected modesty. She
was ready for the last blow-dishonor-
ed by a father ! Nameless.
The lines swept her memory:
T'were better far, unknown and left,
Of home and kindred. Lone and lost,
Than be, andI yet of name bereft."
"Oh heaven, spare me! Spare me
this much. Tell me sir !" he plead
passionately, "that I am not a name-
less thing."
"No, no! Be calm! I meant not to
disturb you thus. In trying to deal
lightly with your father's folly I
touched a sensitive cord. Hal, your
mother was in lawful wedlock when
you were   born.  It is   subsequent
events that made him use this decep-
tion."
Chris tried to sooth her, it was vain.
"Safe," she screamed and dropped
upon her knees with clasped hands.
The scout wiped a briny tear from
his eyes and stood while her livid lips
quivered with silent gratitude.  Per-
haps the first that pulsed her heart.

CHAPTER X.
FAR OFF PEACE.-APPOMATTOX.
Hal had been an inmate at the
Oaks homestead for several months,
yef not a word nor hint passed the
lips of either of the three constant
companions concerning the cause of
her temporary stay in Georgia.
She pleasantly and freely conversed
upon any matter incidental to either
Brantly or Ralph.    Her searching
look examined in vain the placid
countenance of Mrs St. Clair (whom
she had learned to love devotedly)
for anything pointing to a knowledge
of her own sad history.
Even if occasion required the
reference to Pearl's orphanage, Mrs.
St. Clair carefully alluded to her
protege, as my younger sister's child.
There may have been two St. Clairs
who married the two sisters, she
thought.   Howard   was a cousin's
child. This she had heard. She had
learned of Howard's flirtation with
Eva Crawford, of his recent visit
home, and she saw that he was in ill
favor with his relatives.  There was
little of intercourse with the members
of Howard's house because of the
coldness. Other neighbors she pre
ferred avoiding when calls were made
which were not infrequentt.
It was easy to retire to her chamber
as soon as the vehicles entered the
front yard.   The excuse was alway:
accepted: "The lady's troubles compe
her to prefer seclusion.'
Hal's usual vocation was reading t
her kind hostess as the latter sat sew
ing.   Her full, yet musical voice
careful notation of expression, an
lively appreciation of any subject t
be read, made    her an   acceptab
reader.
Mrs.,St. Clair sought to draw o
Hal's inner life as it were, without
suspicion being excited by the latte

A paragraph analagous to her ex-
periences, if read, would   elicit a
searching criticism.
Hal entered the lists of argument
pleasantly, yet never exposed a per-
sonal incident of life.  For instance,
she read:
"Bianca Capello     was  indebted
more to nature than to fortune. Iher
fine person, insinuating manners and
aspiring temper, led to adventures
that developed a talent for intri-
gues, which demanded subtilty and
craft.  The   virtues of the woman
were sacrificed, to unwomanly ambi-
tions.  What nature had made glori-
ous, surrounding influences had mar
red."
"Why should she have permitted
the unsexing of self to ambitions out
of her sphere, even if she dazzled a
court or swayed a transitory realm of
petty aims? Woman's sphere is limit-
ed, yet vast."
Mrs St Clair sewed on without
looking up.
"I have no doubt, dear friend, that
she like many    others, even of the
sterner sex, gave way to the surround-
ing influences. Small at first, yet
resistless if continued. An acorn
planted under a castle wall will cast it
down or force its plumb, if the tree is
r allowed to grow. Henry VIII meant
e well. Surrounding influences made
§ him neither honorable or kingly. The
l monarch was the tool of the subject.
Could influences be countermet or
o avoided, destinies might be defeated."
- Hal read on.
, Mrs St. Clair wondered how soon
od she could strike the seal from the
to hidden secret.
he   It was a lovely day when Hal and
Pearllstrolled to the neighborhood
ut chapel.
a    Humiliation  and   prayer  were

the loss of faith in God. Doubtless
your loss of property, of friends, of
anything, of everything, may at times
eloquently stand up as witnesses to
say, 'all these things are against me,'
but, let us pass on if need belike
Cranmer to the fire, let us drink if it
must be,the cup to the acrid dregs,
let us be stripped like,
"A ship by cruel tempests driven,
And cast a wreck upon the foaming sea!"
Let us say, I am the one who hath
seen affliction by the rod of his wrath!
Cry out as Job, cursed is the day
when they said a child is born, still,
under it all, what then?"
Pearl had caught Hal's hand.
Hal stood with eyes fastened on the
cold slab.
"What then? sweet) Hal! Alone,
poor, friendless, sick, suffering, dying.
Even this ! None to catch the last
word, close the dead eye, fold the stiff
hands, compose the last posture of
death. Even then, is victory !
Think Hal, of that scene when the
sun refused to shine and nature sprang
in spasms of horror; when the dead
cast off the grave cerements to gaze on
the victory, as He cried out,' it is
finished.'
Dear Hal, by letting God's spirit
sow the seed, not we in our finiteness,
you will see as it were face to face !
Your rock of hindrance will be a
great shadow for repose ! You will
have a child's portion, and with a
heroic strength may say: I'll trust him
though he slay me."
The bell tolled for service.
Hal said: ''Let us go in."
During the services she enjoyed the
devotions heartily.
Not unfrequently after this when at
prayer, Hal's warm fingers folded
Pearl's hand.
A year had now gone by. Lee had
pushed Grant back at the Wilderness.

The Southern cross glittered grandly
among the coronets of nations, and
above the clouds of doubt. But there
was only one army left after three
years of incomparable fighting.
Seven had been wiped out by defeat.
The one was Lee's. The seven
those of the Federal Union.
Lee's stripped to the buff and reds
at every pore. It was invincible, yet,
it was flesh and blood.
It was wasting under the constant
assaults.
One mighty venture must be made
on the Chess board of war-"Getty.--
burg."        I
On   July   2nd   and   3rd Lee's
veterans held Gettysburg almost as if
by supermilitary achievement.   T he
Confederates   mingled   with   the
dejected  citizens,  and   eat  and
drank   quietly  in  the  surround-
ing horms, as they rode masters every-
where.  What the great gorge was,
(cut by the rains of yesterday) at
Waterloo, to Napoleon, so was the
Round top to Lee. Be ordered it
covered, God decreed that it should
not be covered.
The crisis had come.
The" fourth'1 found Hancock's divi-
sion instead of Longstreet's peering
from the height.
The vantage of ground was pitted
against that of fighting qualities.
At night the struggle ended. The
boom of shell screamed sadly the
last pean and a few hours at night
gave truce.
Gettysburg was lost.
Lee's immortals were mangled to a
pulp.
Backeto Virginia! Then the long
seige before Petersburg.  Then   re-
pulses, sorties, victories strung out
like a wondrous story on the historic
page.
Lee's army defiant, grand, held at

its last tension, delivered its awful
blows from an arm inured to re-
sistance.  Wasting, dwindling, sta rv-
i'g, it  concentrated  l4t at A p-
pomattox
"Appomattox."   Cut   the   n   e inc
where it will survive brass.
Place it where the pilgrim may doft
his sandal shooi, to rest and read in
wonderment.
Appomattox, the grave of constitu-
tional liberty. The funeral ground
of a nation's hopes.
The shrine of the Southron's valor.
Sixteen thousand and seven hun-
dred muskets in as many ragged,
barefoot, starving men's hands.
One   hundred  and  ten thousand
Federals in front. Sixty. thousand
closing in on the flanks. Gay flags,
rolling  drums and    fished legions
fronted the squalid Confederates.
The tiger was at hay.
The hunters keens.
Longstreet and Gordon    emerged
from an old farm house and mounting
rode rapidly to the ragged troops.
Hunger stared gaunt from    their
cheeks, desperation flashed dangerous-
ly from wild eyes.
"Cut your way through.'
Now for the old time grip on the
musket stock.
,Steady ! Wait fior orders.
General Lee says, "cut your way
through."
"Forward !"
Apponmiftox. ,
The blue line is hid in rel flashes
and smoke. They see the tiger
fangs. They know what portends.
Then rose for once again and forever
the cleaving "Ya, ya, va!"
Like a keen wedge the (onfederate

Well, he didn't.   I tried to git
him clear, but Preecher Hoge used to
say, bray a fool in a mortar you mets
him no less a fool.  He run agin the
Wolf and he got a slug in his skull,

"Poor Ike !" returned Ruger.
"Poor   Prudence,   better  say
Where's the dimes to come from?
Who'll anti up the noodles?"
Ruger felt a pity for the old hag
and drew out some of his pay. She
took it, rubbed it over and over
then slipped it among her rags.
"I wish Ruger, I could make you
glad to-day, but I can't. I used ter hear
a old schoolmaster say onst't, what I
never forgot. I usedter sweep the
schoolroom. He was fond of what he
called  English  classics. The boys
would get him to read for them. One
day he read:
"Yet neer it was my fate from thee to find,
A deed ungentle or a word unkind."
You was always a 'spectful little
cub, ef you don't know me now, and
and I never yeered any meanness
bout yer."
"Thank you Prudence! That's as
good as I deserve, and better than
I've beard in years."
"You'se welcome, because it's all
you'll get flattering from me."
"Why Prudence? I've done you no

"Tell it, I will ! T'was your daddy,

-Who do you mean old slattern, ny
my father?  Don't lie on him or his.
I am   not too  go-d to wring your
skinny neck."
Ruger was on his feet.
"Mean !" she answered defiantly.
"I mean Eugene Armour Prentiss!
Born and raised near Baltimore. The
sport who gamed away all the monev
he got hands on. The fine fellow
that went South and married a pretty
pale thing and left her. The same
wide awake who dropped his surname
Prentiss  for  Armour    to   cover
his    past    meanness,    married
a  school   Miss   and   broke  her
heart, then came to the eend of his
string by cheating a gentleman at
cards, who put a bullet in him.
I mean that your daddy did all
this and I swears to it."
The hag swayed back and forth.
"You kin grind your molars honey,
it's more'n I kin do."
"You said, old slut, that you stole
her; who do you mean? Let it all
come !"
"It's a coming Ruger ! I wouldn't he

CHAPTER XII.
EVA's VIsIT.--THE CARTEL
Pearl and Ralph were seated in a
summer house the morning succeeding
the latter's arrival. Hal was gather-
ing flowers  near   by, apparently
pleasantly occupied. Ralph had re-
ceived such charming accounts of
Pearl's companion, that, he knew her
before his arrival and was installed
on the best terms at once in her con-
fidence.
Why should he object then, in Hal's
company, to sit pleasantly chatting
with Pearl's white fingers in his?
A snorting span of blacks drag
ging  a  stylish  landeau,  whirled
around the fish basin, when Miss
Eva Crawford catching sight of the
party, ordered the driver to bold up.
She jumped out, passed Hal with a
door hinge bow, that meant, who are
you? and joined the party.
After a careful adjustment of the
abundant envelopment of stuffs which
she wore, and which were foreign to
most ladies in the South so soon after
hostilities, she  poised  her  boots
artistically, (only to show them, spang
new.)
Her fan was set in excited motion,
then suddenly arrested as she said to
Pearl, "How close you've kept your-
self this long time?"
"I found enough diversion, Eva,
lately in home duties."
"But now, guess you'll be thinking
of a Northern tour, eh?"
The impertinent stare that attendeI
the question, stung the poor, sad heart
while it roused the latent fire of the
soul of the refugee, who stood hesitat-
ing with duty whether a reply were
in place or not.
Pearl shook her head with a cau-
tion to Eva. "The lady near by is a
Northerner. Be careful !" whispered
Pearl.

" Oh, ind eed . No har m m lieanlt . i)
none."
lava h ad removed a gI(ve, h  lav.
ing a glittering ring.
"Pearl, swe t ! suu nt so      r
get  late  inju al -iis  :  to ;' meeen  oI r i
awhile. Tw ul1 he traitorous  V  - 1;

Hal heard    the  re-iterate(  -
Casting a contemjpio en(, glane ai tb
worlhng she m)otved a way.
"If the solitaire  u)il li y l
gests aii thing. Eva ! lYou n 11

"Oh! have yoa seen   it air   .
Sw iet.'" Eva afiecteul to hide tin ':r
"That's only a keepsake ! '  u1,
mo- re."
The giddy Eva ran on fLr an   nur
then extended an in vitation t( 1
and R dph to unite with a coil .
for a proposed fair to raise  !' pzi
t-r's overdue salary. Shaking
daintily she hurried to her:'i
and was whirled awav.
Ralph proposed a ride after 1
"Hal," he said, "woul enjoy Kt -,

Hal heard the proposition
pleased.
"The nag you'll ride H alii,  i
but is a gay mnover. I found him  u l
grit on the way home."
Hal little dreamed 01 the grn
surprise in store for her.
"That lhagard   Chris, I won

Hal was wondering just tihe' uh
the  laggard  was.  It  was tph,  at

scout rode up.  Every seat was de-
serted save Hal's.  The chair trei-
bled under her but she    remained
quiet.
11 Come in, you  deserter! Where
have you been?"
This, with Pearl's ringing  laugh
and Mrs St Clair's smile of welcome
rallied the dusty, delapidated veteran.
"Come here Ralph! Ladies excuse
him a moment."
Chris raised his hat aloft respeefui-
ly.  Ralph ran to his side.
"I'll come in after you have loaned
me another rig. Direct mhe to your
bathhouse; 'twill be as acceptable as a
ialf bushel of oats to old Rocket."
Ralph ordered young Scip to take
the horse. Dinner was deferred for
the scout.
In a half hour Chris walked in on
Ralph's arm, a handsome, well dress-
ed civilian. Extending his hand first
to Ralph's mother then to the rest ot
the household, he said:
"Now, best of friends, a chair in
your happy midst and the German
blessing, guten appetit."
The dinner was no more a substan-
tial southern spread of good things,
than a feast of hearty confidence and
re-union.
Hal thought, his face is bright,
does it augur well?  One  never can
-tell, he is so passionless.
"You take   your ride, I've had
enough of it. Haven't been  out of
saddle except to feed o1(1 Rocket but

He paused.  )id he think o his
old father's grave at the nodest little

back to the field when he saw (uter

stood at the hits while Ralph waited
to see Ilat On the saddle.
The jueenI  y woman appeared in

A whip hung on her arm as hle drew
on the left gautlitlet.
"iReady'" enquired lIalph. "This

her.  She reached to the  hand   rail

Hal was following at a smart canter,
when -she discovered a cloud of dust
to the left on the road divided by a
fence.
A buggy top glanced under the
fence rows as the vehicle rapidly
swept for the main road evidently
forced to keep up with Ralph.
The speed of the vehicle, lively
chatter of the occupants and neighing
of horses, excited Count. The stal-
lion plunged for a rim but was re-
strained.
Now he began to rear and   leap;
Hal meanwhile coaxing and manag-
ing him dexterously.
She raised her hand to caution the
driver of the near team to hold down.
He saw the violent exertions of the
horse, but did not slack speed. On he
went.
Count made a furious leap. The
saddle girth parted.
Hal felt the saddle sliding and
sprang clear, at the same time jerking
her horse down on his haunches to
complete submission.
Howard and Eva looked back,
but made no effort to assist her.
Ralph hearing approaching wheels
turned and saw Howard urging his
trotters to their best speed with a view
to passing him.
Not seeing Hal, Ralph reined up
offering a stiff salute to Howard and
Miss Crawford as the4as.ed, then
turned and drove back.
Hal was quietly repairing the girth.
The restless Count stood pawing un-
der a limb, where he was hitched.
"You did not fall Hal?" inquired
Ralph, seeing that her skirt was soiled.
"No; but that ill bred fellow tried
his best to have me fall, if reckless
driving past a plunging horse could
do it. Count is ruined! He wants a
good snaffle and plenty of whip. A
curb does not suit him at all."

Hal had fastened the girth strap,
when she burst forth to a rippling
laugh, advancing to the buggy.
"The dust and cavorting    of ty
nag shut out the genus homo. Wasn't
that Miss Crawford? She reminds me
of the pasquinade.",
"What, disbelieve the Dodo;
The like was never heard,
Derive the face of nature
Of such a wondrous bird
Her parasol was held as if under it
was point d'appui. Such a chatter
ing thing would drown a parrot."
"Yes," replied  Pearl, "that was
Eva Crawford with Howard Graham.
They are engaged."
The girth fell from  Hal's hands.
She staggered back.
Ralph leapt out and caught her,
as with a groan she closed her eves.
"She's hurt Pearl!" Ralph ran to
the roadside and steeped his handker-
chief. Returning he spread the wet
application on her temples.
Pearl loosed her neck and  fanned
the pale face.  Patiently  the  lovers
watched her, until glad ly they saw her
beautiful eyes open.
."Is that you sweetest, and you to)
Ralph?"
The tears flowed freely.
"I had a great shock, but I am
better now."
She was lifted on the  buggy  seat.
Pearl drove slowly home. Ralph rode
Count. Neither of the    two  knew
what Hal meant, when she referred
so  familiarly to   Count   Neither
dreamed of the cause of her swoon.
Up to the present, neither Chris
Spangler or Mrs St Clair had made men-
tion to anyone of Hal's secret. The
sequel was fast forcing itself on them.
Hal was assisted to her chamber,
where Pearl tenderly cared for her.
'"I am not hurt, dear Pearl," -he

would say, while the hri ht tea'r drops C
ran fast down her cheeks.           b
Ralph mentioned the affair to Chris f
Spangler, and said:
'I shall call on the fellow  for an t
apology or horsewhip him."
"Just leave that to me, my boy, I'm
awfully out of a job. Besides I amihs-
interested; you re a cousin. Illsec iim  1
and get an apology, or a back down.
"All right.; I don't want the fani-
lies involved, but Chris have him  do
the amende honorable or make   him
take water."
Old Rocket and his level headed
rider slipped out of the  back  gate
quietly.
Mrs St. Clair had seen the friends
talking and apprehended trouble
Chris rode away unseen. He reined
up at a shooting lodge where he saw
a buggy standing. Halting, he asked
if Mr Howard Graham was around.
The individual 1f question was at
the moment examining      a   pretty
pointer pup. He looked up.
"Yes, I am he!"
"Am gratified to meet you!"
Chris dismounted and hitched.
"Mr Ralph St. Clair requests ain
apology for the injury done a lady in
his care a couple of hours ago, and
deputized me to receive it, verbal or
written."
"Indeed!" replied Howard, haugh-
tily.
"He does not     wait to , e   i
the apology is to he voluntary, as it
should be from a gentleman, but, de-
mands it."
"The demand     is none too soon, I
assure you.   The oflense was k no\\ I
to you. You saw the lady's conliti1n
and as a gentleman should have ptlc
ped, both to assist and apologuire.- fh

past."
"Then kindly say to Mr Ralph' 't

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.

and gentlemen, my friends, I would
tan you with what has not yet been
tanned. Make the apology or take a
rawhide horsewhipping."
Chris advanced.
Howard sprang in the lodge to
se'e a shot gun he kept there, but the
broad hand of the ex-scout was in his.
collar. He hurled Howard back
inside of the door and taking the gun
snapped it at the grip by-a blow  on
the floor. Then going outside again
he faced Howard who was advancing
with a club.
The club was swung and the de-
scending blow fell on the sturdy arm
of the athletic man in front, who
seized and wrenched it from Howard's
grasp as a play thing.
The baffled Howard made a rush to
strike, when he was caught, twisted
about and sent flying into the ditch at
the road side where he floundered in
slime and water.
"You shall hear from me, bully,"
shouted  Howard  climbing  to the
road.
"I hope I shall, that you are repent-
ant for your rudeness to one who can-
not redress her own wrongs.  If I
hear anything else, I may be tempted
to play nurse for you.
Just bear in mind always, that a
rooting hog deserves a ring in its
snout."
Chris mounted and road away.
Reaching home, he recited to Ralph
the result of the visit.  The roar of
laughter that followed, caused Pearl
to send word that, "it was selfish to
have so much fun to themselves.
Could they not let the family enjoy a
share?"
Chris was overhauling the farm
wagons, and renewing odds and ends,
on the day following when a dapper
character rode to the shop door, looked
in and dismounted    p

"Good day sir," began the caller.
"Good day   sir," returned  Chris
looking up from his work.
"Mister Wolf, I presume sir!"
The prim visitor pulled up his
collar and coughed to clear his throat.
"No   sir!  You are in error," re-
plied Chris, humoring the mistake.
"Not Wolf! Strange.     Was so in-
formed!   Beg pardon.     Name sir,
please "
"If it is of interest, or may he, von
are welcome to it; if not, then excuse
me, as I am satisfied to have a limited
acquaintance."
Chris began to fill his pipe, the
companion of either an active or pas.
sive condition.
"Beg   pardon!    Tis of interest.
Concerns a gentleman's honor, sir.
My friend Howard Graham, after re-
lating the small affair between you
and   him, to  me, asked  my advice.
I gave it. Suppose you recognize the
situation, if we are at fault about the
name! Small matter anyway."
Chris sat on a saw bench while the
priggish visitor stood.
He eyed the dressy chap from head
to foot, as he inquired.
"Well, what next?"
"This, sir!"
A   neatly   folded  missive  was
handed the ex-scout.
Chris laid the document down as he
blew   the   nicotine  through   his
pipe   stem     Finding    the  pipe
to be not as free as he desired, he
quietly procured a straw and.forced it
through. Then the pipe was not
quite charged; he had to renew.
The irate visitor began to show im-
patience.
Meanwhile the pipe had been lit;
Chris opened the missive and read it.
"Sir ! Your assault of yesterday
demands an apology. I can in no way
connect it with the discourteous de-

r'

mand you saw fit to make for another.
That is his and my affair. My friend,
Mr. Julian Altemont will make all
arrangements (,n my behalf. Yours
&amp;c. Howard Graham."
Chris rose and carefully deposited
the note in the slumbering coals of
the forge, then turning said:
"Mr. Julian Altemont, if your busi-
ness is at an end, mine is about to be-
gin."
The ex scout lifted a grease bucket
containing a compound of tar and
tallow with which he was ready to
paint the dapper gentleman's vest and
pantaloons, when the latter wisely
stepped out of the door, remarking:
"It is clearly evident, Mr. Wolf is
not read up on Wilson. We'll meet
you sir, in some other way, but we
must be satisfied."
As    Mr.  Altemont rode away,
young Sspip rolled in, indulging in a
series of contortions bordering upon
insanity as he wriggled on the shav-
ings.
"Lor a massy, Hebben; Oh ! I'se
most dead. My whole side hurt me.
I larf tell I hab spasm. Mars Chris,
you ain't gee Mars Julian de time
o'day. Look yer boss ! dat buckra
sway he gwine ter shoot yer sune as
he see you fuss time. Oh ladder !"
The'negro rolled and laughed.
"I see wen Mars Julian ride up, I
say ugh, yer's trouble. Jewil and
debblement. I put my yeers close to
de   shop   winder.   I  look  ebry
minit to see mars Julian come out
head fust, and I didn't yer you tell
de buckra you name wen he ax you.
Den I see you git de grease pot.!
Mars Julian light out.  I sway Mars
Chris you mout er treat em spe'tfil.
Again the young negro roledinl
the shavings.
"Keep this from the ladies, yu
monkey or I'll grease you."

"Yes for !" replied the black, "but
Miss Hal done see um already.   Him
bin by de winder wen Mars Julian
rid(, way."
Ie was pleased to think that Hial
was looking towards the    workshop.
She is better, he thought; so she was.
Hal took tea with the family that
evening   After tea Mrs. St. ('lair en-
joiyedl a light, rattan rocker, on the
piazza.
Ralph was at her fret on the steps.
Hal remained in the paillr at a win-
dow in full view of the group.  Pearl
sat near Hal amusing herself with
knitting. Chris, as usual, was pufinmg
the fragrant cherry on the poreh.
It w as a grand Southern night.
The full faced moon hat hed the earth
in  silver glory. The stars fiaded in
the sheen. A faint, south wi ind rustled
the great oaks and ehns.  I'e nmock-
ing birds sant notes as of a rallying
chorus. The household was enjoying
the beautiful scene.
A figure was seen advancing on the
great carriage way. Ihe gate swung
ha'-k as .the latch fell. IIound the
fish basin, the new comer mno ve(l to-
wards the bottom of the steps, then up
the steps.

"Here I am ! I am very glad to
see you! Uncle Scipio how are you?"
"Lor bless your sweet soul, my
missy, U'se tired  but hearty.  Oh
missy. I is too joyful, too joyful to see
you I"
The family formed a delighted, in-
quiring group, around the negro who
had just reached home.
Again and again he seized and
pressed each hand as if his big heart
could not contain its joy.
Finally he discovered Hal seated
in the window.
He gazed upon her as if terrified,
while his lower jaw fell.
Chris saw the negro's perplexity
and nodded assuringly to him.
Scipio advanced to the inside of the
parlor and taking Hal's extended
hand, said calmly and feelingly:
"I hope Miss Hal is quite well !"
"Yes Scip, thank you. How are
you?"
Tank you mistiss, I is too glad for
spressing how I is."
The negro returned to Chris. Tug-
ging at his hand, he led the scout to
the far end of the piazza.
"It's all right Scipio ! Just you
keep mum."
"My master; mars Chris !" returned
the black in alow tone.
"Ef you don't stonish me! Look
yer boss. wot sort ob-er man is you
ennyhow?"
The negro returned and took a seat
on the step, he recounted his adven-
tures by the way until near midnight
"Go see your wife and children
now, said Mrs. St. Clair, "they'll be
jealous if you do not."
"Tank you mistiss! dem kin wait.
I is too glad to git home once more."
The delighted and half bewildered
negro looked again towards Hal as
she sat calmly at the open window.
He could not divine the situation.

Such a conflict of circumstances rack-
ed his mind in the eflrt to realize,
that, it was truly she.
He glanced at the cold collected
ex scout, and drew a sigh of relief.
"Well, I'se keepin de fiimbly up
too  late. Good night all. I'll see
you soon a mornin, please de Lord.
Good night."
Hat in hand Scipio walked towards
the negro quarter
CHAPTER XIII.
THE CLOUD RIFT.
The mail of the week brought a
letter from Colonel Brantly to Chris
Spangler. It read:
"My intention is, to seek foreign
service. Before going, I would like
to get your consent to take charge of
and manage my plantation in Caro-
lina. The direction of anything per-
taining to it will be entirely with you.
So far as compensation is concerned,
you judge of that, after seeing the
property and its advantages.  Not a
word, my friend, have we exchanged
since you removed the indiscreet Hal
to Georgia, about her prospects, or any
development to her benefit. I desire
her mind disabused of any injustice
done her father and    mother by mny
family-(a bit of information had
from you) and which led her unwise-
ly to a reckless course of ill judged
revenge.
How could we desire, or what ends
to be gained-if we were so base,
since her parentage to me was at the
time of the favx pas, and is now utter-
ly unknown?
The fact that she was a married
woman was enough. I lived after
that, and until you made her a prisoner,
away, far away in body and vainly
far in thought.
Poor girl-she iwas deluded ! She
has her virtues if her faults.' Help)

her to stand in the light of truth
Direct to care of Judge Cleapor, where
my stay will be principally until you
are heard from."
Chris repeated   "care  of Judge
Cleapor, thought so ! Well, I'll see
Mrs. St Clair and lift the curtain for
weal or wo."
"Ho,   Ralph !   do  yourself the
pleasure and me the fivor to take
Miss Pearl along to catch a mnormouth
perch at the mill stream ! And don't
come home until you bring at least
One."
"Get out ! perch do not bite this
month in mill water. How'd you like
a jack?" replied Ralph
"Just, as good if it isn't a dapper
skin. Honest though ! Your mother
and I wish to have a talk with Hal
this morning. It will he try ing to
her poor girl.  We want also to spare
Miss Pearl's feelings."
"Thank you Chris ! You are always
good.  We'll fish for good luck to
Hal. I have often     wondered why
that splendid pair of eyes dimmed so
frequently."
The  buggy had passed the gate,
when Mrs. St. Clair called Hal to the
parlor.
Chris sat in the deep window look-
ing out as she entered.
Hal advanced and with a look that
indicated, "the hour is at hand,' she
took a seat.
"Hal;" began the lady, "the w ar is
over, communication is open, inter-
course is being resumed, and I see by
your face in the last few day that
your thoughts are often turning to-
wards home. Now, in the outset, let
me assure you, that so long as yu lee
fit to share ours with us, you may
freely consider yourself part of our
home."
The   beautiful woman   arose and
kissed the cheek of Mrs. St. lair.

She   resumed  her chair   without
uttering a word.
"'Now nerve yourself I'fr a true tale!
It. will pain no doubt, but I know it
will rejoice you inl the end to be 1u1t
ill posession o if truths of which you
have been ignorant."
"I'll vouch for the nerve madam !
remarked Ch ris looking kindly at I al.
The   great brown eves answered
back, "thank you
"Dear child !" 'he charming term
of endearment thrilled    a  sol on
which such words never had flllen he-
fotre.  Hal looked up.
"You have smc gILirlhood fed upon

bling propensities, and died cruelly
neglected, because too proud to tell of
her misfortunes "
"The children lived?" asked Hal
with a sob.
"One I know of positively, the oth-
er, I am told, is alive. Your father's
end you must have heard."
Hal placed her handkerchief to her
eyes.
Mrs St Clair advanced and took the
weeping woman's hand. She still
kept her eyes covered.
Hal felt a ring slipping over a
finger.
She dropped the handkerchief as
gasping she said:
"What is this?"
"Your mother's wedding ring child!
I took it from her lifeless finger."
"My mother; my mother !" scream-
ed the soul-racked sufferer as she
sprang forward and fell on the bosom
of her kind benefactress.
She lay there, the ring pressed to
her livid lips. Her eyes fastened on
vacancy! An Ariadne in loveliness and
new born hope.
Chris turned away. His - broad
breast rose and fell like a swelling sea.
Mrs. St. Clair sat, gently support-
ing Hal who clung to her.
"My mother !" again escaped the
lips which were rivited to the ring.
"Her grave ! Can I get to it?  Is
it known sweet friend?"
The sufferer looked up pleadingly
"Yes Hal ! You may see it after
awhile. It is a long way from here."
"I'll walk there barefoot ! Mecca
to a soul stained pilgrim would be
further away than   it to me. Oh
Captain," turning to Chris, "You will
help me find it?"
"Yes,idear lady, but be calm!  I
il assist you"
"Her name sweet friend! what was
its"

"Alice Roften," replied Mrs. St.
Clair.
"She lived near us in Carolina. A
gentle, delicate thing, too frail for
life's rough usage ! Now I must with.
hold  other matters of importance,
which will hear keeping. 'You need
not bear more to-day.  Be quiet now!
Go and rest up stairs."
Mrs. St. Clair took Hal's hand
affectionately. "Promise me to leave
the rest to my time."
"Then dear lady, I am your willing
prisoner until all is revealed. A
great load is rolled away. There is
the hero who lifts the stone !"
She advanced and caught the hand
of the ex-scout.
"Gratitude, endless gratitude binds
me to you for life. It was a rough
providence that cast me in your way."
Her eyes looked up.
"Thanks to Heaven for it."
She kissed Mrs St. Clair and hastily
retired to her room.
An unspeakable joy thrilled her as
she fingered the ring. The hope of
seeing her mother's grave ravished
her soul. Then    came    the  sting.
Why did he farm me as a founduling'
How is it that my foster father, Doc-
tor Prentiss could not tell me all this?
The dark cloud rolled in on her
mind.   Her father was a villain! his
misdeeds had cursed his blood.
She shuddered, vet knew it was so.
Then the escape from    being the ac-
knowledged wife of Brantly whom
she tried to humble, because of the
error in  believing  his house had
wronged her's,
All rushed whelmingly and she
sought rest in vain.
Pearl had returned, but was kept
in ignorance of everything.
Mrs. St. Clair knew that Hal
would communicate the tidings and
so left the matter.

A~.

THE SCOUT'S RIEVENGfE.

The two young women nlremained in
their room  until a late dinner hour.
Pearl rejoiced that Hal's mind 111was
relieved of so much sad doubt.  H1lal
was excused from   attend iig dinner.
All understood the cause.
Mrs. St. Clair had revealed a part
, of what she knew. W 'hen and how,
could Hal reveal what the scout kiien?
The trial had scarcely begun.
Alone ! T' was   chest  alone. She
slipped away to struggle with duty.
The day had been cloie and oppres-
sive. The fairly were renting atter
dinner.
Hal walked slowly to the ol mill.
There, universal slumher seemed to
pervade  every thing.  TIne arrow'y
pines were motionless.   A    fw fril
like clouds lay idly on a dark hank
at the west, presaging rain at a later
hour. The ducks pattered     ol the
river bank, noising among the Weeds,
not noticing the intruding step
The mionotonsous plash of the drip-
ping waste way told of an ie wheel.
A stray kingfisher watched the shin-
mering stream for prey.
Behind   her  was the deep w(Old

Her mother was at rest: What

She drew away.
"Dear Ruger, you mutt not press
that old folly ! I am glad, indeed I
am, to see you, and will get you to
come as often as you please to the
home of our dear friends, the St.
Clairs, but as I told you once before,
decidedly, you must drop that foolish
style of endearment by w rich you
speak to ne! will you? Promise now."
"No miss pert; never ! You may
will, but I won't. You are dearer
than ever, so I've come to tell you
what I must. You cannot escape me

"But Ruger !-."
"But, Hal! I swore to love you
when a boy, and you called me, noody.

me for a simpleton. Do you ihink I
shall give my Hal up? Darling let
me kiss you?"
"Surely Ruger, you are soon end-
ing a sudden visit that might be both
pleasant and profitable. If you insist
on such terms, I must leave you ! It
is my duty to do so."
She struggled to wrest her hand
from him.
"Foolish chick ! I said you'd love
me some day, didn't I? So you will !
I'll prove it Hal for just one kiss."
"Let me go Ruger, until you are
yourself. Must I say that you are
offensively rude?"
"Say what you please ! You did
that always anyway, but have that
kiss I will. You may make the most
of it."
"I shall leave you!"
She sprang up, her resolute brown
eyes were fixed on him.

ex-scout's feet, as the pair turned.
He leisurely lifted the slip, It was
read in his room.
"Ruger is here; he will cause troub-
'"All right," said Chris, "I must
play nurse after all to Howard. We'll
get the kinks out of this Snarl one by
one. Don't want to have any ex.rps e,
if it can be avoided."
On the next morning Chris went to
the shop and there found old Scipio
and his son, the younger.
"Mars Wolf, noung Scip gone fish-
ining yerly dis mornin, an he see a
buckra in sorter old blue close. He
tell me 'bout it. I gone to de mill,
an  who you tink I see settin on de
foot-log smoking he pipe as oncon-
sarned as ef he didn't care wedder he
fall in de ribber or not?"
"Who?" asked Chris.
"Dat denticle yankee ossifer wot
.we capter on de Brent road, Him
wot inarster drag off de hoss. He
foolin roun yer to git at you boss!
You better keep your eye skin; kase
you did fool dem buckra dat time."
"All right! Saddle old Rocket, I'll
go and see him."
As the two negroes left, old Scipio
remarked:
"Dat buckra better be 'spectful, or,
I sway, Mars Chris will feed catfish
wid em. Look yer boy ! Mars Wolf
is de debble. He wusser dan de deb-
ble."
Chris rode in the direction of the
mill, and waited there awhile. Not
seeing anything of Ruger he thought
to examine the machinery that had
been hard used during the war and
patched by inexpert hands.
Hitching Rocket, the ex scout be-
gan his survey. While inspectinghe
underpinning,  waterway, pc., he
was aware of the presence of some
person, looking up he saw the old nil-

ler whose woolly head and dusty cloth-
ing announced his calling.
"Old man, things are shaky aboit
the mill. Wouldn't be well, not to turn
on the flow until we tix up?"
"You'se  right marster ! Deu
sorter ranshaklin, but we kain't l
no better. You see, dis is de only
run of stone in forty miles rotn   \(ot
Sherman didn't stroy. and nostiss is so
'dulgin to de neighbors dat we got no
time to fix up."
The old negro's theory was, that of
the  Irishman  told  by   Thaekeray.
"when it rained he could not thatch.
when it did not rain, there need not
be a thatch."
The several days of each week
when the mill was shut off, the miller
claimed to he his time. It was when
the hopper jumped indiscriminately
loose, the wheel wasted half of the
water, the stones needed picking, or
the floor gaped until a track of grist
or meal lay on the sluggish stream,
only at such times he argued:
'We kain't do no better."
"We'll see old man ! Don't pot on
the flow again until I tell you ! It's a
sheer waste."
"Dat's so boss, dat's so ! I allers
told em so, jis as you'se a talkin sir"'
The venerable, sable miller made
everything grits that came to nill.
He had one guage, that was Tob's
dictum.
"I allers told em so."
"No one passing to-day?" inquire3
Chris carelessly.
"One strange buckra man, sir.
He's bin round yer tree or four day.
Him   don't bodder nobody.     Talk
sorter knowin bout we peeples. say

Chris gassed that the rosin hunter
was Roger.
The   Beulah  place  was IJoward
Graham's.   Roger must he advised
and restrained.
Chris rode away.
When within a mile of Beulah, he
saw Ruger ahead of him, evidently
toutsore, or worse, intoxicated.
Chris rode sharp and overtook hi n.
"Gad, Wolf! How's tnies my boy?
Give us your paw. Haven't laid ev s
 on 'o-, since the night you pulled the
bacon skin."
Chris reached o't his hand fr a
hearty grip.
Ruger somewhat excited by  rink
saLzed the ex scout's right hand  ithave
muscular pressure that voultl have
maimed an ordinary pahm.

Ruger let go the hand to cut his
tobacco plug.
"Chew !" he offered the plug.

Chris.

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR

The enthusiastic brother was telling
Chris what, the listener well believed.I
"I agree with you, Ruger, concern-N
ing your sister, so you may depend on
my hearty assistance in securing her
happiness. You, however, must not
frustrate my plans."
"How!" asked Ruger.
"Let Howard Graham alone ! I'll
look after him in time."
"Good again ! What is it you don't
get me on? Stuart knew his man,
Wolf, when he sent you to ride around
at will. Now, see here! you're alll
setting up as the bowlers have it. I
can't let Hal's interests go amuck be-t
cause I want to smash Howard Gra-
ham's nose or worse perhaps. But,
there's one thing dead sure ! I'm
knocking around loose. Got my full
pay."
He flung a handful of gold on the
grass.
"Give that to Hal, please !"
Don't drink more'n a feller can
stand, and except whiskey cain live
cheap for a year. I shall scout near
Beulah every four months, Wolf or
no Wolf! Gad ! If, Howard plays
false further than he has done, he'd
better close his affairs.
If convenient you may so inform
him. Tell Hal, I'll see her on Sun
day, p. in. at the mill. Suppose now
for sake of'old acquaintance we toast
the Brent road."
Ruger pulled out a flask.
"No, thank you," replied Chris.
"Now you'd better stop for to day."
"Pshaw, old fel! I can down two of
them and not feel a hair turn."
Ruger raised the flask aloft.
.Here'A good luck to Spangler, if?
he is a Reb, Best regards to the St.
Claims at they aks. Early peace and
content to my precious Hal, and
Wolf,-"
He fixed a wild look on the ex scout.

"Tell rmy gentle sister Pearl, that it'
I could meet her as a gentleman, I
would."
He tossed off a drink.
"So you know all!" replied ('hria.
"Try, Ruger to give up whiskey!
You'll soon be able to meet Pearl."
"Can an Ethiopian change his skin
or the leopard it's spots?  It's in n
blood Wolf! So long   old fe! Au
eye all round. Good-bye."
Ruger rose and entered the forest
regardless of where he went, evident-
ly anxious to escape the eye of one he
so much respected even while under
the effects of strong drink.
On the following Sabbath afteruno,
Hal slipped quietly anay to keep the
appointment. Promptly she was nwt
at the rendezvous by Roger. He hal
been indulging for two days past in the
fast growing habit of drink and show-
ed the results. His strong hand tren-
bled as he took her's, his breath was
reeking.
"Ruger!" began Hal, "you surprise
me! Indeed you'll not let an eneny
so subtle and cruel as whiskey, unmatun
you."
"It's the cruel foe Hal, that is n al
ly subtle. The manly enemy like the
rattlesnake rings the alarm  before it
strikes. Don't scold sweetheart! Y"u
know I can't stand that."
He drew her close to him.
"You'll make Hal a promise dear
Ruger; will you not?"
"Let's hear the wish," he replied.
"Not to drink another drop f;or
year, please, for your good  and il,
happiness."
"Darling if anyone on earth can'
influence me, you are the person I Lah.
I'd cut my right hand off for you.ht,

He tore her from     his arms and

Her nimble feet bore her swiftly

CHAPTER XIV.
THE LIGHT STUNS-DAY WI'N,.
The continuous strain of revelatiin
pressing one event after another, was
fast undermining Hal's heroic nature.
Mrs. St. Clair had     tried to guard
against this, in withholding the re-
lationship to Pearl.
It was dark when Hal entered the
house; not seeing Pearl she hastened
to her room. There sat the unsuspect.
ing girl waiting Hal's arrival.
Hal rushed   to her feet, s zed her
around the waist as she gasped, "M v
sister ! my sister !"
Pearl thought some sad news had
overtaken her, as at once her mind re-
curred to the coarse stranger.
"Hal, dariin g! what troubles von.'
Tell me; tell Pearl."
She raised the bowed heal. ihe
eyes were closed; Hal was senele s.
Gently the poor sufferer's headwa,
laid on the chair next to here, then
Pearl summoned help.
Mrs. St. Clair came in and aplilit-l
restoratives. They had but a partial
effect.  Hal rallied and again swoon-
ed.
A hot fever supervened.
"Telegraph   for Doctor lPreunti

The message was carried belon : nni
in a few minutes Rocket was 'i a run
for the station urged h lii, mla-toO.

treachery of a marriage, '(consum-

follow. His object was to get a reply,

She was vivacious and animated to
briuqueness.  This he thought to be
fast and a want of sincerity. She's
fine looking, and  will "catch  up"
with some unsophisticated chap. so he
reasoned as he folded the Pollowing.
"The   annexed    certificate  from
Rodman, speaks for itself: You are
very well aware, that, the attempt to
marry one P,'entiss to me, (whoever
she may be) is not the engagement
I contracted with Hal Armorn. What
purposes you   had  in view, are as
mysterious as dishonorable. She, wh'o
has a reason for suppressing a father's
name, has a motive which forbids a

charge, of having    assumiied a false

at once to Irudence Shanloi to in-
quire into the i atter.
The  wily hag saw   a new way of
extracting d( dllars from Ial s purse.
"I  thought, Mistress Ilal, that a

said, or the curroner, or may he the
sheriff! t'enny rate, he says, read this."
"I read the durned thing, all writ
up and stomped and waxed up! it
didn't say nuffin, but that, Miss Hal
was marrid, that's all."
"You see Miss, how t'is! Jim fooled
Ike. He didn't write all of the paper,
at first. The last part about the name
Prentiss, he put in after he got Ike to
sign
This really was the true state of the
case, but Prudence guessed it, and
Hal accepted it as reasonable.
"Don't you drap    a line  to that
worthless young villain. He wants
you to say, Go ! No, let him go, but
hold the rod over him."
Prudence calculated again, that a
fee might be had from Howard some
day. At anyrate a big thing was
brewing. She'd get the skimmings of
the vat if no more.
Hal left. Deadway with the convic-
tion, Howard is trying to get out.
Referring the matter to Doctor
Prentiss, he pooh, poohed the whole
affair.
"It's a great pity dear Hal, that,
you  did not consult me before that
silly step, but if he desires to go, let
him."
Doctor Prentiss had grave doubts of
his brother's first alliance.  Why
clandestinely marry the girl only a
day or two before leaving Carolina?
Why keep the marriage and her early
death a profound secret? Why kid-
nap the child?
He made no special eflrts to trace
the matter, because of the preponder-
ating proofs to sustain hims fears. For
thib reason he permitted the children
to believe they were orphaned cous
ius-children of uear relatives. The
bore the name of Amnou' and lived
as    his    own.    ituger   spent

years away at school.  Hal remiainel
at home with her foster parent-the
bachelor Doctor.
Hal's chagrin grew to a degree (f
untam+ale hatred, when subtequent1x,
for a quick retort to the Bentharn
(whom she remembered inebibihtoHl
she  was reminded    that "the pert
poult might flaunt feather- in the
face of poor folk, but that wouinl't
rub  out the  fact, that the St. (']hiry
and  Brantlvs of    South  Carlina,
wouldn't know    their own sister ""

an Armour. or whatever he might hr"
"Do you mean to say. that.    ople4
connected with my father's wif',, re-
fused to attend her last hours., lti.
she was my father's wife?"
V-al lost sight of any filial tie, in
the desire to repel the insult t hr
father.
"Yes; I mean Mistres Hal to top yOu,
what is commonly reported.     Your
father ruined your name and hr 'nght
misery on the last hours of as g'l i
young wife as ever claimed  a titledi
name and grand home.     No: kol
your pert speeches to your-elt in
future, and know thi if we re ' r.
we have our shure of felhin r.
" A h, Mrs Bentham!" replied Hab1
"you've  opened  my eves to dayt  it
as well to shame.  'I f rgi)e y1, it
you'll pass by what I did not uian
for rudeness."
Riding away, she vowed1 with an
uplifted hand.
"They cast my mother out    r -iN,
not her own.   I too am cast  it.! I
Will pull down the ruin about al

grew to the alder's egg. and  aO WI
11ainy troubles.
1 howard has tried' t  eseapm.  I 't
give him rope awhile.''

Hal plunged again into society, t10
see or hear aught of the Branty Or
Graham family.
She made a trip to Europe N withith
doctor uncle, and    at Geneva wais
booked for a mountain drive with a
party of southerners.
'Leo  Braintly."   The name was
familiarly  intoxicating.  'hic  mail
handsome, courteous, gallant.
She skilfully avoided him   as the
revolving mirror avoids the ftce, only
to return to see it still there.
She read heedlessly at the l(t of a
mountain   pine.   The   unbending,
straight tree did not look more direct
to the blue alcove  above, than  his
fixed eyes on her averted face.
She was always farthest from him
where the goats browsed on t1mhe most
ragged heights, yet his long athletic
leaps reached her in time to) lead her
away.
She always begged, that he  ould
"not desert the company for her."
Leo agreed, that, she was the per.
fection of beauty, but he thought, she
is repellent. She avoid  me!  I  will
test her for all time.
"If you   were  on that glacier, a
thousand feet below, (he eyed    lier
calmly) and I should   bring  yovU a
tried rope of rescue, you wSonI aced pt
a stran of yarn in preference, if a-

"Ready? One!"
The report of two pistols was as one.
Brantly stood fast until his second ad-
dressed him.
"He has winged you, Leo!" thrust-
ing his finger in the coat sleeve.
"No, guess not!  It has passed out
of the cloth."
The party of the other side leaning
on his friend was slowly supported
away.
He carried a bullet in his right
shoulder.
From that hour, Hal placed herself
under Brantly's care, and permitted
"a friend's attentions," hitherto avoid
ed. She met him not again until at
at the Springs, then the dual conflict
of revenge and respect clamored for
sway. Revenge conquered.
Howard heard from his uncle's lips
of the marriage. Now, he thought, I
am free! False in name, false in vow.
The flimsy pretext he had was a
gossamer thread.   Yet, with cruel
audacity, and crueler falsehood he
braved the issue.
He strutted his room in velvet
slippers, Eva's latest gift
"So you've marked a day in De-
cember for the marriage!" said the
dapper, Mr Julian Altemont. "Dang
it, she's stylish and can put up the
rocks.  The old man got a cool fifty
thousand for the cotton Sherman
couldn't find."
Mr Altemont depleted Howard's
basket flask to the extent of half a
tumbler. As he set the flask down,
he held the glass aloft.
"Luck, old boy!"
A gu p was taken, and  the glass
was posed for another sentiment.
"May you and I live to see the
weeds over the graves of enemies!
By the bye, is anything more to he
done about that little afliir with
wolf "

He put the glass down.
"Of course ! but as he prefers the
style of the slugger, I'll meet himl)
with slugs. I would not hesitate a
moment to fill 'him up with a charge
of lowmould if he faces me."
Howard    lit a fresh cigarette and
stretched off at ease.
"That lady   over at the Oaks, is
deuced bad off' they sa) ! Had a hrain
attack. Who is she anywa' Got a
squint at her once in passing. Stup-
ning, but mopish kind."
"Don't know !" replied    Howard,
"you  see, since  Ralph's high Bight,
our houses don't visit.  None ot our
folks have met since we came hone.
Miss Crawford drove over to call on
the  stranger, but quit in dtilwon:
Says, she's lowbred.  Walked a av
without saying good morning, hecaue
allusion  was made   to the   north.
Didn't of course take the trouble mo
find out if she was a hired reader or
a prospective school marm."
Howard had not the remotest idea
that the wind bags had a dangerous
knife blade in close proximity t them.
"You're awfully out, my boy. She's
no second rate.  Narv time ! There's
more in a step. or a set of head. than
there is in millinery.  I'd give a lot
to see her walk when she felt as ii' she
was alone.. Airy, di'stng  .' haug hty,
gentille e '" '"
"You'd better declare on the pot!
There's pen and ink." said Howari.
"Funds !"  Mr. Julian    Alitennt
was a professional soak.  He had lost
his property by mortgages and carrel
little for results when  he went int')
the war.  He had a good record  a
soldier  which  insured  him   what
Howard had not, respect.
"Spons! would be as well a;'le to
starve her as any other poorer:l
That don't take away the shine :-1m
her whoever she is.

I

Well Howard, I'll stand for you at
ten steps with Ralph, Wolf or the
devil, and besides se- you through at
Christmas. You'll have to anti up
for my suit. Let's have an X now!
Thanks; adieu ! Au Revoir."
He bowed out, swinging a fancy
whip as he went to his horse.
The   lady  at the  Oaks was in
Howard's mind, but he pictured her
away up in Maryland.
Hal's uncle, Doctor Prentiss reach-
ed the Oaks four days after the tele-
gram. The sufferer was passing the
crisis. The family physician subject' .1
his treatment to the opinion of the
uncle.
His reply was: "You have done all
that is possible."
Nature was contending against a
fearful blow.
Pearl stood leaning over the sufferer,
watching with a sister's devotion every
quiver of the lips or tremor of the
hand.
The brown eyes opened as if upon
some far off abstraction   le pale
lips whispered unintelligible fragments.
the fingers opened and  closed  as if'
grasping a restless something. Anon,
she felt the ring. A smile played
swiftly on the face and a tear rolled
on her cheek.  Then ensued a doubt-
ful pause.  The   breath  seemed  to
cease; the body became rigid. The
eyes stared at vacancy as the fingers
clutched the bed   clothing. Then a
deep sad sigh, a torrent of tears, and
a whispering of wildest incoherences.
"Let the sunlight in ! Make all
cheerful," said the uncle, "it's a fight
for life now."
A few hours will see the victory of
nature or Hal a lunatic forever."
He   sat feeling the  pulse. Tle
afternoon was one of those soft periods
so well styled, the Indian summer. A
faintest west wind rustled in the great

oaks.  A  noble singer, who' lhom''e
was near Hat's wiilndow, on a 1,
bough, opened his throat with all f a
nm'kingb-ird's lustine ss. The even.
ing sun slanted chee'rfullyi athwart  e
chamber.
Pearl called the Doctor',;m aitt ''toin
to the tears that flowed  freely  while
Ilal seemed to breathe more quietly.
The uncle bathed    her face  ;hi a
delicate aromati'.  l'earl leaned  geve
to kiss her lips, when the hrown e' es
opened with a smile.
"Sister."
The voice was very fIint as he'
fingers closed on  l'eaIl's hand , an(
the tears ran fast.
The doctor prepacu a sli ht stint'-
lant and put it t(, her hips: she ( :ek.

She looked in her uncle's  'e.
''Yes, hial ! hut quiet love.'

The two shook hands warmly. In
reply to the inquiry, "How is your
patient ?" he said, "she is fearfully re-
duced, but the worst is past."
"She has had enough Doctor to
bumble a stout man. Nothing but
Hal'strue grit could have sustained
her as it did. The worst of the
disease is over, and so is the worst of
the cause."
The ex-scout spoke as if to himself.
"I am delighted to hear that. I had
feared t'was only begun," said the
Doctor.
"No! with her it begun years ago
It developed only recently."
"You'll give me a sketch of the
affair ! please"
The Doctor sat on the saw bench.
Chris touched incidentally on Hal's
marriage and   Howard's desertion.
Then referring to the misapprehension
on her mind respecting the Brantlys
and St. Clairs, related the second mar-
riage to Leo Brantly.
The Doctor was astounded!
"Her stepmother's brother?" he ex-
claimed.
"Yes, but she did not know who
she was, so that she could not know
the connexion with him."
Then he related as to the scene at
the springs, Brantly's dejection and
alf-imposed expatriation, the ride on
the Brent road, the capture; Ike's part
in the drama, and the scene at the
Benthams. How     he suspected  her
identity, and so placed her where she
is. Finally, he recounted Mrs. St.
Clair's revelation of Hal's parentage.
"The first union of her father was
not illicit?" asked the Doctor eagerly
"She is of as honorable marriage a
wa ever coutractd," replied Spang
ler.

''Then, am  I largely to blame

"Yes, she   is the  daughter of \Our

The doctor returned    to the room.

her nativity and Pearl would ac-
company the party as a generally ad-
mitted sine qua non.
Chris and Scipio set about putting a
covered wagon in order for the uses of
a commissary and A. Q. M. equip-
ment.
The tall, bow spring family car-
riage too, was made ready for the
jaunt.
Six  weeks rolled  by. Hal was
quite restored, then a day was set
for the departure of the party.
Phoebe, a Letty maid of fourteen,
conspicuous for an ample head of
combed   and  greased  hair [Scipio
vowed the scizzors against plaits]
and profuse in a much starched home
spun plaid, annoyed her father fre-
quently as she cautioned him.
"Mistiss say, you muss put dis yer,
and dat dere, an   ."
"Look yer gal," returned Scip;
"Mistiss doan't send sich fool mes-
sge to me. Mistiss know I gwine to
do exerting right. Ef you gwine to let
little bit ob bile flour stick you mout
out arter me same is you frock skirt,
I'll send you back to de nigger house
and put Chloey in you place."
"But papy," returned the pouting
'NPoebe.
"Shet up yer mout; shet em up, you
imprunce. Gal, I hain't bin four year
in Ferginny for nuttin. Bejunce das
de law, bejunce; don't bodder long
me."
"Chris laughed as Scip fastened up
the breast straps, Phoebe walked off
muttering at the military tyranny of
her "papy."
"Lor hab mussyl, Mars Chris, de
carriage want paint. Look yer, de
hound rampang-     ."
"What is that french, Scip? Say it
again."
"Chris was carefully looking to the

harness. The war had been hard on
every material.
"You does mek fun too much Mars
Chris; lemme told yer.
Dat picter on de panel useter he a
dog rearing up. It mean, one oh de
hounds ob old General St Clair, (my
marster's grand fader), one time see
fire in de house, wen de famhlv was
all sleepin, and de dog rear up aging
de door and howl till all wake up and
come out fore de house did hun up.
"Yes, I understand now," returned
the ex-scout.
"Oh hebben, Mars    Chris, dis is a
great old carriage. 'Twas brand new
de night Marster was married, I'se a
tellin yer.
We wus all on de boxes waitin for
de minister to say  amen, in  de old
Colleton brick church.  'Twas (hrist-
mas time, de bosses was cold and I
knowed dem niggers would all try to
git to de front step  first, to let den
own people be de  yeerliest to meet
Marster and de bride. So I telP
Harkle my step boy, doau't wait for
me to say whoa: you get de door open
and steps out by time I haul up. Well
sar, Marster and Mistiss git in di same
carriage"
He slapped the wheel to verity the
fact.
"Marster say, all right Scip: one
minnit more and I was gone.   Did 't
dem bays put it down?   Harkies look
behind and dere was a line  most a
mile long, buggies, carriages. gigs, dog-
carts, and horses under saddle. De
niggers had set fire stands long de
road to luminate.  Ebery nigger in
Colleton lub my marster and mistiss.
We crashed by; de diggers dance
for joy as dey see us agwine.

Some of de buggies cut by a
way, kase dem knowed my top
was too high for de low limbs.

'twon't no use.   I was a trabelwiin;
yes sar, I was a gaining.
De front gate was open; up de ath'-
nue, all long teenn de oak was lirht-
wool fires.  Up to deh ig ton i te
wen I hauled up I yered de ,teps fIa l
and War war Harkles a grinning.
I was lere fust by   tree  or fPre
lengths.  As Mistiss get out, lie a\',
"Sci io!"
The tears ran from   the  ex-lave's

eyes.
"Ilean Ober and  say, my  mi-ti-
She put dis yer watch in m ohand
He pulled out a large, silver huii-
ing lever and showed it to (Chris.
--Yes, Mars Chris, dat same ninti ss
yonder, in de door. Lonr bless moy
muddei-, my mistiss! She aim a wid-
der lady now, but ef Scip hbber de-
sart her, kase him  is a free nigger,
may dis watch stop  he ticken   and
please de Master, may my heart .top
he beaten."
The negro put up the watch.
"De carriage is good  and siroing
but he  want paint.   Well dem1  is
coming, I must git on de box.''
All were seated.  Little 5ei(p dirve
the wagon behind. Ralph rode w iti
the ladies. Chris was mounted n'0
old Rocket.
The journey would ocenpy one day
to the Savannah river, and at leat
two to the   Colletoil place; so, the
orders were to let the horses (10 their
best.
The precaution of a tent, 'vas s1
part of the foresight of the re'ictmir
soldier, as also cooking utensils and t
supply of provisions for ten days, e(
ing and abundant wraps.
Zell and Videau ran freely attst

occasional shot by one of the gentle
met picked up a partridge.

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR

Old Seaflower is done lay up, and Scip
will soon follow my old boss."
The tears ran down the honest
black face.
"I can't sing much now, Mars
Ralph."
"Ki, papy! enty me yeddy you last
night, singing  myself.  How   you
say-?"
"Shet up, you tarmagin! Shet you
mout. Who ax you to talk?"
Scipio's, adness vanished as soon as
his presu ,tive young one reminded'
him of his abilities. She might jab-
ber as much as she pleased in the
cabin, where loquacity was a part of
the elementary training of young
negroes, but when in the presence of
her superiors, especially when he, the
father was the party addressed, any
forwardness was squelched indignantly.
Phoebe chuckled quietly, knowing
that the noise of the rebuff was the
greater part of the danger.
"Phoebe tells the truth ! You sing
very well.-,What was the favorite
boat song? Daniel wasn't it?"
"Dat chune, Mars Chris, put me in
membrance ob a great time we had
jis afo nisties git married."
Ralph nudged Chris. "He'll go
back on pedigree now. He's the most
aristocratic old negro in the South."
"We was coming from Charlestown
to de home place in ole Seaflower,
and marster, you fadder Mars Ralph,
had mistiss and a young gempleman
from de nor'ard wid him in de bote."
Chris moved close to Scipio, under
pretense of re-lighting his pipe.
"Marster call for Daniel ! He say,
Scipio must lead!1 I call for Hannible.
De gempleman larf arter me, and I
didn't like it. Ennyhow ! I'se yer
to-day. Me doan know way him is!
We come a bilin to do plantashun,
and  arter dat master always like
Daniel chune."

"Why did you get vexed, Sipio.
asked Pearl.
"Case missy, our peeple all hab re.
spect for de black folk, efdenm is
black.  We hain't got no eddicatipo
and de hair is short like de wits, but
we'se got feelings."
"Oh he didn't mean to offend,Rcip,"
replied Pearl.
"Missy, I keep my eye on dat buek.
ra. He nebber come to enny good.
No ma'am, him too triflin like. \Vhy
ma'am he trifle wid Miss       ."
Chris whispered, "Stop!"
"Dat lef hand mule is tarnily gittin
loose! I nebber see sich a greeter."
Scipio knew there was a wherefore
for "stop." So he desired an ingen-
ious excuse for holding up.
Pearl thought the "trifling," might
be too plainly expressed by the nerro,
who often transgressed proprieties un-
wittingly because of a lack of speech,
so she dropped the subject.
The next evening the party drove
by "Honerhill "
Chris and Ralph surveyed the hard
fought field.
"Our boys did not have the num-
hers which they engaged." remarked
Ralph, "but it was good fighting,.'
"Jenkins was the geniusof the day.
He once lifted one of his men on his
shoulder close under fire, and carried
the poor wounded fellow off. I'm told.
He got Hartwell's cap on this field
after the yankees retreated.
The party camped     near Csaw-
hatchie, in sight of memorable "Tul.
lifinny," where another night w,9-
pleasantly passed.
The ladies occupying the tent with
Phoebe in a snug corner. Chris and -
Ralph on the carriage cushions hefbre
a smart fire, and Scipio snoring under
the wagon in his ample blanket.
Another early start was made Nov
they pass "Pocotaligo." where Eliot

the  Salkehatchie, then   the driveI
verged east towards the main land in f
Colleton.
As afternoon set in, Scipio from his
carriage box saw the familiar outlines
of fields and forest.
The negro's love   of home and
locality caused a profound silence to
possess him.
"Home in sight yet?" asked I-al ph
from the inside.
Chris was riding close along side.
"Ah, Mars Ralph ! you kin jedge
for yourself, boss! Lemnie tell Mars
Chris, bout old home."
Scipio in emergencies fled to his
plug of honey dew. He whacked off
a chew to keep the sad flow of thought
under.
"Well, yer we is on (le line o (de
Berkeley track ! Jis yer, sir, is way
my old boss had a standhfor a buck-
a cute old coon, wot used to run phmn
out in de road leadin all de does and

He waited on he hoss wen de dogs

of the slves on the plantation.

couldn't git a drink from de old well,
but lets go on."
He climbed hack to the carriage
box.
When he drew rein again the river
flowed brightly in sight, fringed with
fresh marsh.
The tide rippled sparkling under a
soft wind. A few trees left by the
vandal hands rustled a sad welcome.
A pile of debris showed where the
old chimneys once stood. A twisted
iron rail indicated the front step.
A fragment or two of marble peered
out from the ashen heap. This was
all there was left )f "Brantly Hall."
Ralph handed the ladies out then
strolled to the cemetery near by.
While he and Pearl went arm in
arm through the sacred ground, now
overrun with scrub growth and weeds,
Hal was conning names that seemed
familiar as she read them on the
stones.
Chris had the tent pitched while
the negroes proceeded to look after
the horses and supper.
"Scip," said Chris, "you came very
near letting a cat out. You began to
tell about that young man night be-
fore last; whtt's his name?"
"Who sar? Mars Eugene Prentiss."
"Yes; he was a near relation of Miss
Hal."
"Well, well! I'se so glad you stop
me. I wouldn't hab hurt Miss Hal's
feelings for de wuld. So him is some
kin to Miss Hal?"
"Do you remember who he married
Scip, when he came here?"
"Yaas sari  My soul, didn't him
marry Miss Alice Rofton. She war a
purty noting lady, and lib bout tree
mile ober by de club house."
"Had she any relatives that, you
remember?" asked Chris.
"Only old Mr Rofton, him fadder
Do old genpleman stay yer wenl de

yankee come. He say, he ain't gwineK
to lebe him wire and Miss Alice
grabe."
A calm, pleasant evening a id nigt
was spent. It was again "at home"
to Ralph. He was too     hrave an]
magnanimous    to repine   or ;peak
harshly of the  outrages seen anmt
him.
As General Shields said to a C1-
onel commanding a volunteer rej.
ment, on bidding him  adieu:-Wa
Colonel is rough, very rough. Colonel,
Colonel, it is rougher than nio-t men
dream of."
Ralph repeated the indemi, auul
looking about cheerfully, reiterated1,
"very rough."
Next morning, by    an  agreemeit
with Chris, Ralph took the lade  ' out
to fish.
Chris was soon after seen riding
over on the Club   house  road. He
reached a poor cottage with  a cliay
chimney. A flock of martin tlew in
and out of a large gourd which -wung
from an oak stick nailed to the r()t.
A shabby clapboard railing eneluHed
a little  vegetable garden. An 1M(
bench, whitened by the weather. st')l
at the front door, which swung on
leather straps. Snarling from  u ler,
the house was a mean cur, which re-
treated as the horseman approa'hi ul.
just as -a cock flew to the garden pal-
ing to announce a visitor. De nationn
and poverty were seen everywhere.
"Hallo!" said Chris. striking the

"Mr Rofton, I believe," said Chris,
occupying the bench.
"\ell stranger, I was held as that
once, twenty-five years ago, when ladies
and gentlemen were in these uirt ,
but old Rofton, is all I expect now.
Old and poor.
The old man took a seat at the end
of the bench.
"You remember the St 'Clairs and
Brantlys of course?"
I'd he a renegade to gratitude it '
did not. They were my kindest neigh-
bors!  Rich,  b'.t friendly. Aristo-
cratic, but never did they dilpnarage
an honest name.  Mrs St ('lair, the
widow, was as queenly a wife as I
ever met. Is she well?"
"Excellently well, I thank    you!
She'll re occupy  her lands soon, I
expect."
"Then, old Rofton will nlot peri'h

Chris pulled ont he i pipe.
The old man rose tremblingly, as
he pointed across the road to a p'n.of
oak  poles  that enclosed a grave.
Faing Chris, the wrinkled face q uiv-

channels phmghed by sorrow.
"That is all of her marriage to mie,

He struck his breast.
"Death."

broke her heart, and afterwards stole

My Alice was nineteen. A pretty
brunette, devoted, pious and guileless.
I feared the tinsel of city style, yet,
he seemed so respectful. My poor
wife was unsuspicious.
He was handsome. He stole my
child's love.
Orly a few days before he left, she
consented  to an  engagement. He
called for her to ride on the day be-
fore his departure and urging her to
4    marry, he promised an early return
with his parent's consent.
She was an innocent, confiding
child.. They went to the house of an
itinerant preacher and there were
marred. They returned home next
day. What could I do?
It wP9 too late. I made the best of
it. The villain never returned; the
devil! My child pined away. Day
after day her cheeks grew whiter.
She sat for hours looking out upon
the.road. No letter, no husband! A t
last she fell ill; a child was born to
ler. She died before seeing it.
There is the grave! Sweet sacrifice
t3 misplaced love.
Mrs. St. Clair, dear lady, prepared
her for the coffin, and at my request
took her ring.
The child grew to be a little prat.
tling thing of near two years.
She was stolen from us, how; I can
hardly tell; but I think by a strolling
gang of gypsies, one of whom came
about us Sveral times.
We pui'neI the baud. This par-
ticuolr woman had gone-they said;
by s8amer from the next river land-
ie then, my poor wife followed,
and here I am waiting. Ah sir, he
wrought ruin in my poor house! May
hi portion be better than mine, is all
Cris gave the old man a package
of tobacco and a little change which

he had, then shaking hands left him,
saying, "I will see you soon and bring
a few friends to cheer you up."
"You are very kind sir indeed: I
am so much among the deer and
negroes, that, I feel far out of the
world. It carries me though nearer
to Heaven, I trust."
The ex scout rode   away with a
cheery whistle.
Reaching Ralph and the ladies he
felt that every  moment now was
golden to Hal.
He requested Ralph to ride with
him to Leo Brantly's plantation to
inspect it. By dinner time he had
surveyed the tract and was prepared
to report to the owner. After dinner,
having given Ralph the hint, the
party drove over to the Rofton hut:
Chris in the lead.
"Here is a relic of the war," sail
Hal sadly, looking ahead at the shab-
by hut.
"The low country of Carolina has
suffered greatly."
Chris handed the ladies out, as they
moved away he said to Ralph, "take
Pearl aside, but be near enough to
hear a call."
He then motioned to Scipio to drive
on.
Stepping to Hal's side he said:
/-This old gentleman will tell you of
your mother, Hal !"
- He spoke commandingly.
She was blanched    as if ill and
trembled in every limb.
"Be a woman, Hal ! May I leave
you to the test?"
Her brave, brown eves responded
proudly to his searching look, as she
replied, "Yes, you may."
Chris turned away, then looking
back as if to re assure her, said, All
right! I leave you," then moved off.
The old man had been weeding his
small garden spot. While there, oh-

Socially our ways were far apart as
they c mmanded the first society, but
had it not been for my notions of
independence, they would have over-
stepped conventionalism to meet me
on my plane. Ah, fine stock that !
A kind greeting was invariablyEleft
at my door.  How is Mrs. St. Clair?
Well I hope; and Leo, her brother?"
The latter name came as a knell
Hal's breast.
"Thank   you sir ! They are well,
and may return here soon. Tha is,
after Ralph has made things con'-
fortable."

serving the dispersed party and the
carriage he tottered slowly out on the
road  towards the   victors.  He en-
countered Hal. A pang of comniisera-
tion shot through her as she saw the
poor, patched   garments which the
aged man    wore.  He raised his hat
politely, at the moment Hal took his
disengaged hand, saying, "be seatel
sir ! You seem to be feeble."
"Heaven bless you, lady ! Such
considerate  words are like  angels'
visits.  Yes, I can't get around niuch
now; the   old  bench will bear me
awhile yet ! It's the worse for time
too. You sit first; there-."
Hal took his hand tenderly. The
dim eyes lit with surprise and pleasure.
"' ou are with the party yonder?  I
see the gentleman who was here this
morning, hut I forgot to get his name.
Memory like the sun fades at night."
"Captain Spangler !" replied Hal.
"Yes sir, we are friends on a visit to
Brantly Hall, and I -, I am seeking
information."  The  tremulous vaic
caused Mr. Rofton to look up. "Cap-
tain Spangler tells me, that you know
the St Clairs and Brantlys," began
Hal.
"They were to me before the war,
the kindest of neigh bors and friends.

We crawl for it as the Monk up the
stony basilic!  We bleed for it as the
patriots in Virginia; but where ! Oh
where is it found? There is but one
place of peace."
He pointed to the ground at their
teet.
"There is a truce to life's sad drama !
There is peace."
"My dear sir! your loneliness has
saddened  you   much  beyond  that
reserve which your education, I may
say religion calls on you to rally upon.
There is a peace, that this world gives
not, would you lose it to be rid of
your past experience?" enquired Hal
sweetly.
The old man shook his head. Draw-
ing a soiled colored handkerchief out
of hisbreast he wiped the tears away.
"No! You are right, sweet lady!
You are right. But then, the billows!
Yes, all of them,have swept over me "
He sobbed bitterly.
Hal waited until the paroxysm had
passed.
"You lived here before the war?"
she asked.
"Yes Madam! I had my little all,
around here, and here I want to die."
"Kindly tell me, dear sir, about a
lady named Alice Rofton? She was
said to have married a relative of
mine.
Hal was content with nothing but
irrefragable proof of her legitimacy.
She feared, at times, that, Mrs St
Clair may have been deceived.
"Then Madam, for the sake of your
peace, you had better not ask any-
thing of me. You a relative of the
man she married? Iam a relative of
the Alice he injured. Please don't
grow pale and angry; I am an honest
man and of an honest family. I do
not want even to see, hear or think of
anything connected with that man.
Forgive me, if I sin."

He lifted his cramped finger, to th4
attitude of a petition.
,-He-was a villain          .
Hal trembled under the unbering
denunciation, and   thought, the (u'rse
still follows.
"But if I tell you, he has one to
his last accoutn t.  He   sill  wrng
your family no more,' returned Hal
"So, then I am dumb! The dead are
safe with me."
The old man folded his hands ancross
his knee.
"Tell me then about Alice and her
baby."
Hal looked eagerly upoin the (uir.-
ering form.
"It's many a day lady, since I ,aw
Alice walking, but if ever a \niiau
moved like a princess she did. You
are just about her height. She was
not so  troug as you are-her eyes

is like her too.  At any rate, ie was

Hal clutched the bench.
"Worse, the   monster, when   her
child was a cheerful toddler abunt us.
all we had   to live  for, sent and
kidnapped her."
Hal's face was averted.
And Alice died?" asked Hal, in
agony of soul.
"No, she was dead, died as she gave
birth to the babe. Sweet, dearest
Alice, she never saw the child."
"Oh sir ! I feel so much for her
suffering parents ! May I speak to
them?"
"Lady, you are speaking to Alice's
father."
With a wild scream Hal clasped
the old man's neck.
"I am Alice's lost child !"

Chris saw the embrace and walked
around the carriage to hide his feel-
ings.
Ralph and Pearl among the fox-
tails, saw the old man's thee as it peered
in Hal's, they thought it too ,acred a
season yet todisturb.
"Alice's child ! My Alice's baby?"
He   pushed  the  beautiful  head
away at arm's length and with wild,
impassioned stare, repeated:
"Alice's child?"
"Yes, grandfather ! I am Hal Pren-
tiss ! I am the stolen one. Put your
dear old head on my bosom and tell
me, tell your Alice's child, that you've
found peace."
She drew the head with its thin
gray hairs to her beating brea-t. The
long, scattered, white locks mingled
in her brown tresses like the drifting
snow flakes, on the peaceful slopes of
Lebanon's Valley.
He gasped. and sprang back as he
took her hand. His large gray eyes
dilated wildly as he held her at arm's
length.
"They   will steal   Alice's baby
again !"
He seized her with both hands.
"Come by beautiful Alice's child !"
The old man drew her after him.
They crossed the road. He still held
her hand as they stood at the little
enclosure of oak poles. Releasing one
hand as if fearingto lose her, he pull-
ed down a panel. They passed in.
She looked at the clean, evenly
dressed grave A moss rose hush par-
tially hid a very small, discolored
head stone.
"Alice."
Hal read the inscription, and fell
prone upon the grave. Her lips were
pressed  to the stone, as her white
hands embraced the    mound above
her mother.

The old man's eyes were riveted
Wildly on the prostrate form.
('hris moved up. Pearl and Ralph
also drew   mar. The    ohi man !aw
them.
"I1 a, lalph  you  splendid  hov!
Pearl is that Nou?  And there is the
gentlenmani who gave ie the Ilonlley

of the o1ld mal, who shook in every

"Hush ! Not a word. They stole

He pointed to Hal.
""That's Alice's baby ! My  Alice!
IHal ph, you've played many a time
with her at jackstones ! Wasn't, she
pretty? That's Alice's baby !'
The old man knelt by the side of
Hal and lifted her hand to his lips.
'She's dead too !" he cried, and fell
lifeless uponl the sod.
Pearl and lRalph raised the in-
sensible form of Hal. Chris waved to
Scipio who drove up rapidly.
IHal  was   tenderly  placed(  on
cushions under a tree.  Pearl bathed
her tace: gradually the color returned.
Hal opened her eyes and smiled on
each in turn.

Pearl too had told her all.
The night was spent on the spot;
Chris having sent ihr the baggage
wagon.
On the next day Ralph read the
burial service from Pearl's book. Hal
saw the remains of her grandfather
decently interred by the side of the
beloved Alice-her injured mother.
She clung to the paling while Chris
repaired the little square enclosure.
The last nail was driven then the ex-
scout drew back. Hal entered the
sacred glebe spot and knelt with
clasped hands.
The hats of Chris, Ralph and
Scipio were quickly removed as with
beating pulses each of the men turned
aside their faces. Pearl leaned her
face on her hands, while seeking the
cover of a tree to hide her fast falling
tears.
"Out o the depths."
The woman y prayer seemed to conse-
crate the wilderness around.
"Am I lifted."
Her brown eyes were upturned as
the jewel drops fell from them.
"May this dear spot."
Again her lips touched the stone as
she plucked a daisy from the grave
and hid it in her vest.
"Unite me with the portion of my
mother."
Here was Hal's regeneration. Grace
had won. A last look at the two
clean, grasslessagraves, then turning to
Chris, she said:
"My friend, I am ready to go back."
Pearl took her arm and the sad
party drove away for the Oaks.
CHAPTER XVI.
BRANTLY SEES A RIFT.
Chris wrote to Brantly, as follows:
"It is now six months, dear friend
and Colonel, since you and  I sepa-
rated at Appomattox. I must not con-
plain against little to do, since there is

an abundance of good table cheer, pleas-

worse, the horse pond bath The hero
would have been Howard Graham.
By the bye, that Colonel who gave
you a fair fence at Brent's road, is a
clever fellow, but for XXX distilled.
Had you doused his glim, you would
have been minus a nephew.
He is Pearl's brother, son of E. A.
Prentiss. I am watching him as he
is likely to get into trouble here. The
chap swings a rough right arm.
Well what of Hal? Hal, is as gen-
tle a little woman as you ever saw.
She is Hal Prentiss. Don't start.
Daughter of Alice Rofton, the law-
ful wife of Pearl's father, thus half-
sister of Pearl and Ruger aforemen-
tioned. E. A. P. effected this match
during a college vacation which you
remember. So that it is my special
p.ivelege to report her line straight.
She is at present with your sister.
True as steel, and very devoted to her
accepted aunt.  Hal is now  waiting
to clasp your honest hands or stout
knees or both, and say, forgive a de-
luded woman.

mingled pleasure  and  disgust. H
saw, from what had  been previous
told him, that Hal had been cruel
deceived as to her origin, and nece
sarily as to her treatment and that

That, added to Howard's base co

the hold woman sought requital, not

But, what of the cowardly IHoward;
who had caused so nmeh suffeiriii

The Colonel t ook   leave of his
friends and returned to the home of
the Jfudge, where he had spent several
(lays in each month since the surren-
der, while waiting a reply from Chris
and closing up other minor afitiurs.
Besides, he was in correspondence
with friends abroad concerning an ap-
pointment in the army of Egy pt.
-   The Judge and Brantly w ere seated
0n the ample lounge in the billiard
room before a fire  Brantly handed

CHRIS SPANGLER, OR

Armour, except perhaps by myself
and one or two others). No; he mar-
ried one Hal Armour, as truly that
as Hal Armour Prentiss. The Arm-
our is a surname of the family and by
it commonly used. Besides, admitting
Howard's plea, which is only a base
pretext, marriages and baptisms are
more frequently performed with the
use of the given names than the en-
tire name. I am not disposed a
moment to admit, that Howard is
other than a villain, bent upon aban-
doning one he has tricked to take
another.
Now as to your faux pas ! That
was unavoidable. It fell to your lot.
That is all. She was possessed of re-
markable attractiveness, moved in
excellent society and so carefully sup-
pressed the match with Howard, that
it was known only to a few. The
kind consideration for Doctor Pren-
tiss covered even that from public
gossip. Assuredly, when you met her
abroad and later at the Springs, it
was impossible that you should not
have been ignorant. Had I or any
gentleman been circumstanced as you
the result would have proved the
same. As to the validity of the mar-
riage with her, that cancels itself.
Either she purposely . resolved on
bigamy, or to be more charitable, on re-
venge for supposed   wrongs.   We
know she was bent on the latter, in
the admission made to your scout.
At anyrate, fraud violates a contract.
She offered you a wife; legally she had
no wife to give; she was already wed-
ded. So far as the moral view goes,
you did no wrong ! On the contrary
you have been severely wronged.
There are times Colonel, when un-
avoidable ills beset to stab an honor-
able life and cloud a social career,
but, who is safe? You were cruelly
duped. That is the sum of it. My

wife and I knew of this very soon
after it occurred.  I could have told
you  before Spangler  unearthed it.
Why   not?   Because  it was of Ino
consequence, and certainly I did not
desire to rob an old sore.
Just letit all go. Hal regrets it; you
have acted   kindly, magnamiously.
You said, in good faith, I'll take yon
to wife; she had no wife to give. You
found this out an hour later, at once
left her, and so discarded a fraud. On
my honor Colonel, you stand before
me as if Leo Brantly had never seen
Hal Prentiss."
Brantly sat still as the keen eyes of
the lawyer looked in his.
"So you have always known of'
this?"
"Yes ! and more. I knew that her
father had left a damaging impres-
sion on the mind of the hired nurse
against your family. Aye sir! He
was a base man."
Brantly saw a savage look on the
Judge's face.
"He was the author of her troubles
think you?" asked Brantly.
"And mine ! I shot him at his own
challenge, and shall ever regret, that,
I did not bear reproach, rather than
send a fellow creature unprepared into
eternity.
The Judge rose and offered Brantly
his hand.
"Excepting the mortification-that
has been so extreme, you are morally
and socially free from any cause for
reproach "
"Your   opinion,   sir !"  returned
Brantly," is valued more because of
your being disinterested as also for
your candor. I accept it and thereby
am much relieved."
Brantly continued, "you'll see that
Spangler looks after my affairs while
I am absent, but he needs funds to
put my plantation in working order.

I will therefore get an estimate from
him  as to the expense and send a
check before leaving..I
The delay incurred by a mortgage,
&amp;c., will inflict me on you again for
awhile."
''You  have   the  original  ofler
Colonel, to share what is mine as you
may   prefer. Come and go as you
please."
Brantly therefore used the hospi-
tality of the Judge's household mtre
frequently and for a longer time than
he expected, owing to the delay in
obtaining a loan on his estate and the
necessary  preparation  of  papers.
Meanwhile   he often   studied  Miss
Cleapor's face, to discover ifhe might,
her views as to what he was assured,
she had learned from her father; but
at no time did he see aught to excite
an unpleasant thought. Did she, as
her father excuse his mistake on the
ground of the unavoidable; or was she
unconcerned?  He    had enjoyed the
charm of her society sufficiently long
to realize the constantly prevailing
sentiment which intensified with each
succeeding clay; she is a splendid wo-
man ICalmly he encouraged the
fascinating deam, but anon, a black
wing darkened nearby; a shade of
humilation saddened him; she can hut
barely tolerate me !
Once, while   at her side in the
flower-garden, he startled, the beauti-
ful Virginian, as with a ton of irony,
he said, "The mythic conception of
manhood is the capacity of an Alicides
to perform the twelve labors, with no
better reward than a wasting, living
death ! How is it, that one may pluck
up opposition, stout as trees, by the
roots, and yet be a weakling because
of one misstep?"
"Did the ancients concede to their
deities perfection?  Was not Hercules
the sport of Mycenae's and Argo s

thing? A kick sent to I einos, the
armor er of the (Iods; another for
fblly was turned to a beast.   These
allegories.   otonel, point a truth, to
err is human ! Is there, can there he
a perfect man?"      The lady spoke
energetically.
Brant ly returned  to  t he subject.
"Why t hen the human verdliet, to err
is tI h ('onden11c( I ed per  e  lThe
admitiission of human frailty should be
flowed by charity."
"That too, (Coriolel, if left to huma'a
judgement may b strained. Man pre-
s1umes over inc11h  where  leniency
cheats a proper restraint.  You recall
the play of words which had reference
to the presu mably inl fallible head of
the church, '/,a;ra non polest erare!'
He   deserved   the   stricture. No,
Colonel, there is no human standard
for human government that is fiulIt-
less. That of justice hand in hand
with mercy, is the only infitllib le a_
size.  All legal exactions are can-
celled in the (God man alone."
"And   yet a   wrong is none less
wrong ! I aw is entitled to its de-
mands."   Brantly  was foIrcing  th
argument only to prolong it.
"Colonel, it was not a blind pityv
that once said , 'go sil no more ! It
was a vicarious right inl Iinn wh
stood for mail, not against God."
''Ad fitted ! Still, the sill was glar
ing; law  required its victim: Publi(
morals were to be worse or better inl
the verdlit. Public opinion imea-ured
the act.'

to-day under the guise of philan-
thropy ! It breaks the bounds of con-
stitutional right and tramples liberty
to the dust. It is manifold, like the
head of Janus, looks everywhere at
once, whither it will. It frames a bill
of rights for the African, and one of
non rights for the Chinese. It be-
heads a Charles I. and rejoices in a
Charles II. It   writes  a  Magna
Charta; and rings the bells of St.
Bartholemew. It calls a Luther to
produce the key of Reformation, and
invokes a Hugo to re-establish the
Pantheon. Does such a weathercock-
guide better or worse society? It in-
fluences, I grant, as the breeze does
the lake; but does not stir its hidden
energies.
To-day, a Charlesthe Bold loves
France until he'd have several to rule
her, to-morrow, a Philip unites the
provinces. To-day, a Washington is
the laureled hero opposing tyranny;
to morrow, Jefferson Davis for the
same, is a traitor.
-No Colonel! There is no guage
save truth. There is no truth save as
found in righteousness. There is no
righteousness save as found in God's
law."
She paused, a moment, then added
in soft parenthisis, "You'll excuse a
little church woman, Colonel, whose
Bible and prayer book write against
all save the great head of truth, errare
Aumanu eat."
"You are a stout defender dear
lady, so stout, that the danger of de-
feat holds me to the issue, not to say,
the delights of your conversation."
He raised his hat. She smiled. "Still
there is so wide a desert, I use the
word thoughtfully ! So wide a desert
between the Soudan of dry theory and
the Barbary of delightful realization,
that I renew my point. As the per-
plexed Pilate said , to the mute

prisoner at the bar, 'what is truth.'
You will have to permit the assertion,
I regard both it and duty so misunder.
stood, that the popular rendering is
as devoid of justice and as heartless as
the bed of Procustes !
"I renew my point ! A life of values,
of virtues, of excellencies goes for
naught, often because of a trifling slip.
What becomes of the harsh, dry, burn-
ing selfishness, called propriety, that
depends such an incongruity?"
"The desert, Colonel, lies there to
make us value an oasis now       and
then, the exception, to the rule which
propriety holds. The desert has its
blinding siroccos, its glittering aridity,
its bones on the way ! All these make
the night winds more welcome and the
stars more glad.  It is there Colonel,
to remind the traveller who tempts
it-that, it is a desert! Let him be
guided to an oasis-duty, and he is
safe. Let him   be reckless and he is
lost. Truth and duty are synonymous.
Kant says, "Duty !-wondrous thought
that workest neither by fond insinua-
tion, flattery nor by any threat,. but
merely by holding up thy naked law
in the soul, and so extorting for thy-
self always reverence, if not always
obedience, before whom all appetites
are dumb,however secretly they rebel!"

"We are unable to pierce the past,
the future is hidden from us, but the
categorical imperative call of duiy to
be performed stares us in the face-the
obligation of one and all of us to do
our share, and to live up to the
highest ethical and osthetical stand-
ard we can formulate, without regard
to reward or punishment and before
the worship of every other ideal."
"Are there no exceptions to the iron
rule, Virginia?"
She turned sharply, although he

I

had spoken no less respectful than
familiar.
"Vhosoever sinneth in the least,
bath violated the whole! Still, mis-
takes are our lot." She looked steadily
at him. He felt strengthened.
"Thanks dear lady! Now adjudge
my case, you being the second whose
opinion I have asked, except that ofa
legal friend."
He stood in the way of the lady, as
if anxious to get a reply.
"Colonel, you must first put the case
in form. Whether it is one of love
at firt sight, an old preference wear-
ing away, a resolution to take monas-
tic orders or a vow to love all women
alike, I cannot say ! You have come
into court unprepared so far and the
case is to be emended."
Worse and worse, he thought ! I'll
now leave the matter for awhile where
it is. She  will probably learn all
from the Judge ,
As he sat reading that afternoon,
Brantly saw the Judge and his daugh-
ter arm  in  arm   promenading the
piazza, while the father talked in a
slow emphatic manner, Virginia look-
ed straight ahead as one who sees the
way.
Brantly could not from the calm
manner of both infer anything. He
hoped and yet dreaded the result, if it
was concerning his faux pas.
Virginia Cleapor had now learned
everything from her father. She was
surprised and for the first time saw
the reason for several ambiguous ex
pressions dropped by Brantly. Annoy-
ed to know, that a brave generous
gentleman had been subjected to so
long a period of mental discomiifoIrt,
she thought, but that is his adair, I
need not think of it again.
She was mistaken. Anot her garden
stroll called up the inevitable.
"I promised my charming friend

inot to be an Atlas for burdens not
self impi~iosed.  I have succeeded."
"I rejoice with you Colonel ! There
are too many unavoidable troubles in
life, for us to cling to the dispensable
one-," she replied.
"Anid soi much    happiness if we
dared reach to it ! Is it accident or
fate that. leads us to the threshold of
serenity and shuts the d(oor on our
sight?"
Ile plucked a leaf on which depend-
ed a big rain drop.
''Some, dear lady are the glaring
diamonds of pretension ! Flashing out
and ever beauteous light, from a sel-
fish self! Some-, I'd rat her say on
is this rain drop under the leaf ! It
has no pretension, it will not flash,
only as the sunlight of virtue and re-
ligion bids it, then it gives out, not,
self. but grace from   above. Anm I
right?"
Unsuspectingly, she rep lie, That
one Colonel, is fortunate to wear such
a trophy of praise."
"Yours is the richly deserved meed
sweet friend, and   with it I oiler 'a
man's deepest homage." Ilie took her
hand.
"Virginia! Leo Brantly has crossed
the desert of dreariness, and dares ask
to  bask under the soft stars, anid in
the sweet repose' of your confidence-
I love you , and love because I hav-
learne'd what love is.'
The handsome pair returned arm in
arm, pledged.

"Him   ride  past yer yesterday!
Didn't say nothin, but look in like
he'd want ter see somebody."
"If you see him again, tell him to
meet me anytime at the mill."
Scipio returned the polite, "Yaas
ear."
On the day following Scipio was
tugging under a bag of corn towards
the mill, when he was familiarly hail-
ed, "Scipio !" turning he saw Ruger
riding towards him.
"All well at home, old man?"
"Tenk you sar, all is sorter mid-
dling."
Scip pulled his hat politely.
"Miss Hal has been very ill they
tell me, she is better, eh?"
"She war berry sick sar, awhile
back, but she am pert and all right
now sar."
"I am very glad Scip to hear such
good news! You'll not say to anyone
that I am here! except to Captain
Chris. I'd like to see him this even-
ing."
"He tell me sar, to tell you, to pint
de mill. He'll meet you enny time."
"All right Scip, about four o'clock."
At four Chris and Ruger were sit-
ting on the mill dam chatting pleasant.
ly and smoking.
"I've been engaged by a circus
company that is travelling the South.
My gymnasium acquirements came
back quite easily, and I am tolerably
good at pugilism. Good enough to
caricature a Heenan. The pay is
enough for a single man and too much
for a whiskey drinker. What I want-
ed to see you about is, here's a little
money for Hal, she must need it, and
an ornament for Pearl. When you
deliver them I shall be gone."
Heputa roloflgreenoack in the
hands of therex-scout, and an exquisite
set of pearls set in filigree.
"She'll wear them from the scape-

grace brother, on the night of her
wedding. Another matter is, Howard
is about to marry Eva Crawfird.
That I shall prevent. He might mar-
ry the Devil's sister if he chose, had
he not played false to Hal, but he
cannot run his role unrebuked. Hal
despises him   I know, and well she
might. She would never speak to hun
again ! Still, that does not leave hint
free  to do  as he pleases. He can't
marry any one if I know it."
Ruger closed his burly fist in an
emphatic way.
Chris admitted the correctness of
the position, the brother had taken,
yet apprehended trouble as the wed-
ding was set for the next week.
"You'll take me along," said Chris,
"when you go to interfere."
"Of   course,   my   good   fellow!
Wouldn't feel as if I'd treated Hal's
best friend right, unless you were
along to keep me from making an ass
of myself."
"You're clever in placing such con-
fidence in me ! I will be ready fbr you
at any time you send me word."
"We might as well agree about it
now Chris! This is Friday. On Wed-
nesday night the affair is to come off
at the church, at seven. Meet ne
here sharp at six. Will that do?"
said Rnger.
"That will do! Its a pity the dirty
scoundrel couldn't get rid of the ex-
posure for the sake of his fanmil y and
the girl;" remarked Chris.
"Not a bit of it! He des, rves any
thing. The family are about the same
ilk. Awfully tony and cruelly selfish.
As to the girl; she took any one, and
can't blame another than herself! By
the bye! Did you hear that IBrantly

The church was gaily dressed with
wreathings and mottos. Hot house
plants were ranged in lovely spiral
display along the pulpit steps. A
profuse bgguet ornamented the read-
tg desk, and a great hell, like love's
cornucopia seemed ready to pour its
fullest delights on the heads of the
candidates to he presented.
The crowd assembled until the pews
were packed, and the vestibule a jam.
A flutter of fans was followed by a
great buzz and whispering. The car.
riages of the bridal party rolled up to
the door. Then the slamming of car-
riage doors, driving away of one and
halting of another vehicle.
Next the arrangement of the party!
The brilliant clang of the wedding
march by an expert organist, the cran-
ing of necks, leveling of glasses, smiles,
criticising and finally the presentation
of the couple attended by twelve pairs
of waiters.
Chris might have been seen on the
leftof the altar, in whit is known as
amen corner. He leaned carelessly
against and behind a post that sup-
ported the gallery.
The ceremony proceeded until the
reverend gentleman officiating, said,
audibly:
"If anyone objects, let him or her
now speak, or forever hold the peace."
"I object," was heard savagely from
the rear of the church.
The audience turned to see a power-
ful man pushing through the crowd.
Altemont twisted his  moustache
daintily as he looked at Howard.
A bare minute elapsed, the bridal
party w~re agitated. Eva was resting
as if quite ready to faint on Howard's.
arm.
He glared savagely as Ruger faced
the clergyman.
The congregation had risen to their
Afeet.

"I object, to that match!" repeated
Ruger, ignoring Howard's look.
"By what right sir. Please state it.
But do not allow a captious obje tio
to disturb so sacred a scene as this"
replied the minister.
"That man sir ! Has a living wife.
By heavens I'll prove it ! I am Ruger
Prentiss, brother of      ! Do yon
remember?" He glared at Howard,
"Please announce," said  Howard,
"that I can clear this all up. You'll
dismiss the proceedings "
Eva had reached the fainting point,
and  uttering  a shriek  fell into a
friend's arms. She carefully protected
the Tetlow's and Lubin's before the
collapse.
Altemont bowed to his partner and
excused himself with the remark,
"I'll call on you to-morrow, must see
this little affair out."
He then removed his kids and took
his stand p.side.
A   ew pgre           around, but
most of the congregation, fearing
trouble, went outside. The minister
remained to counsel peace.
"I hold a little document Mr Ruger
Prentiss, that may be of interest on
this occasion, please allow my friend
to read it! It is a certificate from
James Rod man, N. P., that the true
name of the lady I contracted with
was Prentiss-not Armour"
"So you   saw  fit to desert a lady
whom   you  decoyed as a school girl
into marriage on this pretext! This
is what you would like to convey to
the public. Did you marry her for
the name or herself. She was both
Armour and Prentiss. My father
gave her his legitimate name, if not
all of it, and she an infant at his
death was none the wiser."
Ruger faced him s'a near that Chris
got ready to interfere.
"No sir! You are a villain !"

"Hold   on  please  MrPrentiss,"
interrupted Altemoit, "Thiis is not the
plcet fir epithets.  If you'll select a
friend I'll arrange all the incidentals
outside.  A fire stand, and pair of pis-
tols are handy "
"You   see ahout the incidentals as
soon as you please and stand aside, or
I'll pitch you   out of that window
Stand aside."   Ruger laid his hand
on Altenont's breast and moved him
easily aside.
"You'll answer to rme first or last as
you please," said Altemaiit buttoning
his coar, ''Howard you'd etter pocket
this paper. but stand up to the issue.
I respect the church au my friend the
minister. If you (it) not transfer your
case outside you may excuse me until

Altemont retired, at anvrate to) his
credit as a gentleman, and remained
close at hand.
"Do you propose," said Howard,
'pressing the issue of your responsi-
bility first, or the lady's unwarranted
claims on me? Either will suit my
convenience.'
At this moment Chris Spangler
stepped forward bowing to the minis-
ter and the few remaining members
of the congregation. He said:
"So far as the paper is concerned
which Mr Graham holds, it is met
face to face with this, a stub certificate
witnessed by the official who per-
formed  the  marriage  ceremony in
1860. I vouch for this:"
"The herculean frame stood more
crect than usual as he looked around.
"The effort Mr Graham      makes,
may be apro forma case, but he knows
the sequel already.  As Mr Altemont
has said, this building was not erected
for such a scene. and I move that we
adjourn"
"The good minisler touched Chris

oil his shoulderld d w    rhi peed, "try
and keep the peace."
"I wvill sir," said Chris, b'hut a lly

Chris do- cined the honor.  Ruger
took the flask and  n  1ured out a drink
in the metal cup that was a part of
the Vessel.
"Your health si'," addressing Alte-
mont, "better society is deserved by
so good a man."
True to his friendship, Altemont
refused to receive the toast that in-
sulted his friend.. -le pou red  the
liquor out then replied, "a goad man
never deserts a friend, nor recognizes
one as such who'd insult knowingly

where that large chip is, there you
are! Now gentlemen at the crack of
MY pistol you'll fire."
He stood  about five paces from
Howard.
A t the moment the fire flame drifted
fiercely to one side. A vehicle swept
up. Hal and Pearl sprang out, and
Ruger's band was pinioned by the
beautiful deserted wit.
"Hrother, you'll not be a murderer!"
"Ah, Hal, my pet, is that, you?"
He   put the   free arm  around
her waist and kissed the pleading up-
turned face.
"I did not start out dear girl to do
murder or be murdered, but when the
devil puts his agents in a fellow's way,
how then?"
"Roger, if you took that man's life
t'would avail you, what?"  Hal clung
to the pistol arm.
"The  sumpreme    satisfaction  of
knowing, that an arch scoundrel had
run his rope ! Hal, do you see who it
is?"-

"Yes dear Ruger, but you must not
stain your soul even for him."
Pearl was excitedly urging Chris
to interfere! She had never met Ruger
to know him, although it was her only
brother. Her anxious look was now
turned to Hal and Roger.
Altemont stood near Howard.
"Who the deuce is that splendid
woman? By George, she's a countess."
"That is the short stop in my game,
quondam wife, Hal Prentiss, so-called,"
replied Howard. ,
"Dang it, Howard! You're a big-
ger ass than Iaever supposed. Do
you  put the two, Eva and that lady
on a par-and run the risk besides of a
forty-four slug in your avoirdupois.

Altemont sauntered away to laugh,

Hal said. affict.ionately, "And for

"You little gent! My pure little sis.
May I kiss those red lips?"
He let Chris have the pistol.
"Brother,"  she  replied, "I have
thought so unkindly, that. ou did iot

brother; for my sake, my dead ovia ther's

Ruger turned and looked at How-
ard who remained at his position.
He pressed Pearl's face betw'eeii his
rough palms and kissed her lips as if
she were a child.
"Yes petty  sis. I did not intend
seeing you because I am a rough boy!
But you are so pretty, so sweet, that
I am a deuced sight hetterthan I
thought! Say Chris! tell Altemomnt he

Chris had a short talk with Alte-

very much.
-"Gad, Captain! I beg pardon for so
misrepresenting myself to you, as to
require a paint brush to brighten pros-
pects for a gentlemen. Didn't know,

He turned to Howard: "I stuck

feared, you may recall my hint just
before we left for the church! I must

Howard uttered an oath as he dis-

She lay against his heaving breast.

Hal too was leaning on his breast.

Pearl and Ralph were married very
quietly at home. Mrs. St. Clair
agreed with the young people, that,
the Pad condition of the South to-
gether with a wide extended acquaint-
auce precluded a large preparation.
A few near friends, with Chris to
hand the pretty bride to her gallant
husband, and   Hal to greet them
warmly, was a delightful occasion to
the noble mother.
April. The family are all in the
pinelands near the Carolina estate.
The "Oaks" in Georgia was sold to
good advantage. Chris is every day
directing,,. planning, superintending
some new structure or renewing some
injured machinery. He is working
Brantly's Retreat place, at the same
time assisting Ralph at home. A
renovation  seems to respond under
his sturdy blows.
Captain, what do you suppose Leo
writes?" said Mrs. St. Clair looking
up from  an open letter, just had by
the mail.
"That be is in the Khedive's army!
He's a good soldier! Did I tell you
how he rode in at ManassI. Like a
free paladin! All alone. Spurring to-
wards Stuart's black horse troop he
bowed and touched stirrups with me.
We ran afoul of the regulars and had
a slashing fight. Leo got too far in the
lead. I thought, I'll help the stranger.
Nol He can help himself. Three
blue jackets rode at him. One a
lieutenant in front, two privates, one
on each side.
Ha, how the sparks flew! Three
blades playing at one. The one li
ing like a sheen of joy under the

Two hostile swoirds are left.  "Nt  i

a well trained horse. He gets them
separated.   There  goes a terrible
sweep, one is leit.  He rides at him,
parries his blow, and runs him through!
After the  fight I got his nam
We've   been one ever since. But I
beg pardon Madam,! Get, me on iny
old Colonel and y)ou loose the talking
valve."
Mrs. St. (lair's eyes glow ed with
delight as the ex-scout told of her
brother's prowess.
"He writes, that he is to marry
Miss Virginia Cleapor, on the first of
May."
"Well Madam! She is a sensible
w.lman, and he a lucky man. I'll he
on hand sure!"
"Yes! here are the cards, one mark-
ed special, for you."
"Good! Good!" said Chris, reading
his note and card. "I am to be best
man! Ho     there! Mrs.   Pearl St.
Clair!"
Pearl wascon     the balcony with
Ralph. She came in laughing.
"My little directress of proprieties
read that and get me ready as Leo's
best man. If'uanything is outre about
me I'll say you are to blame."
It was time for Spangler to start
out for Northern   Virginia. Scipio
was running the crops pretty well
under Ralph's advice. It was mutu-
ally agreed, that Ralph and Pearl
would remain at home to allow Mrs.
St. Clair the pleasure of attending her
brother's wending.
Hal desired the opportunity to re
visit her old home. The three de-
parted in ample time to reach their
destination.

Chris stood shoulder to shoulder
with his friend. His huge moustache
concealing a benevolent firm :mouth.
His penetrating eyes disclosing his
inward pleasure.
The word is spoken, and a blue
solitaire-(a gem Brantly had re-
ceived from his father which he pick
ed up on the field of Algeirs) was put
on Virginia's hand. The old Judg

The Judge had desired a full at-
tendance of relatives and friends. Phe
old halls and parlors were filled with
au elegant colipaly.
The elite of the old di minion rallied
to witness a favorite's nuptials. Spring
contributed its richest gems out of
floral treasuries, to deck the scene.
Loving hands twined garlands in
every doorway where the bride must
pass.  Brilliant fire stands caused the
white palings outside  to glitter like
silver bars.
The Judge did the honors of recep-
tion  His genial greeting was as wel-
coming as the broad porch on which
he stood.
Carriages rumbled to the steps, and
drove away as group after group ar-
rived.  The  results of the war had
left all of these ges s comparatively
ruined, but wit the prideof family,
they rallied th  best possi le ' n this

Mrs.St. Clair arm    in arm with

A slight Irenior passed over Brant-

to another.

The invitation to ''I)octo r I'rentiss

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE BUI)LINGS AND CHRIS.
Time has steadily cut swaths along
the  way   we have   come thus farr.
Death and separations are its in-
variablt work.    To-day  is; to-mor-
row, what?
Ours has been a set of stout+ hearts-
these in whom we feel an interest. At
times the future with at least two,

inii es of Rilcilis, eold, hard, lifeless.
But, there was a guiding Hand that
shaped the future to life symmetries,
beautiful, classic, immortal.
The rusty nail of accident or design,
yascillated, swerved, agitated the corn-
pass, until the Argosy rode almost a
wrek on life's seas! Yet, a faithful
wrc     nlf'     es     pilot was somehow always there to be
the Palinurqs to calmer waters.

ed  all of his property to Hal, his
favorite.
Mr. and Mrs. Judge Cleapor have
returned to their valley home, which
was vacated by reason of frequent in-
cursions of the enemy! His age and
infirmities obliging a passive position
during the war of the States.
Brantly  and   his  splendid  wife
divided  time  between his estate in
South Carolina and Judge Cleapor's
home in Virginia.
Ralph and the lovely Pearl are the
joy and comfort of Mrs. St. Clair.
Hal is a constant companion of her
aunt She seems to look into the
benevolent face, as if to say, there is a
debt yet unpaid!

THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.

Chris superintends Brantly's plant- 
ing interests, and is a pronounced
favorite of the vicinity. Not a hunt,
or fish, or club, is complete without
Chris Spangler.
Ten years after Appomattox! Two
urchins, one a stout flaxen haired boy
with intense blue eyes and skin as fair
as his mother's, rejoices in the name
of "Lee St. Clair."
The other a well grown, well knit
lad of same age, with a cast peculiar
to the descendents of the mother of
States, answers to the appellation,
"Stuart Brantly,"  are mounted o
ponies of the marsh tacked breed-
hardy, true and swift animals.
The two childish faces are turned
towards the horse lot. The chafing
bits are held by steady, plump fingers.
A glad laugh lights up their counten-
ances. A noble stallion steps out of'
the stable, and strides grandly under
an erect rider.
"Off with you boys! No racing. Il
not have it. Go to the lower landing
and at best not out of a canter. I'm
right behind you, dye hear?"
"Can't I win a bet from Lee, Uncle
Chris? He said Dash could outrun
Rosa in a quarter. It's a good road
and my girth is all right," begged
Stuart.
"No sirt You do as I say, Lee! I
I catch you at bets I'll put a stop to
your going with me. Get away you
monkeys, and ride like gentlemen,
as your fathers before you."
The lads rode off.
Lee said slyly to Stuart, "If we ge
him on the score that Rosa is a littl
stiff in front he may let us fret bot
to prove that she isn't."
"Don't fool him!" replied Stuar
"but I'd like to leave you a length.

"Chips of the old blocks. They'll

Count or those boys will run the
whole three miles."
Chris drew on the bit and Count
bounded away.
It required a half mile of hard run-
ning before 'hris got near enough to
hail them down. They drew up.
Both tackies in a drip, and both the
boys full of explanation, how that
Dash kept on after Rosa, or Rosa ran
because Dash pushed her.
"Is she stiff Lee?" asked Uncle
Chris.
"No sir! I think she's all right,"
replied the laughing youngster.
"Yes, and you are both all right!
You've had your race, but don't let
me hear about the bet."
Brantly and his wife sat on the
porch as the riding party passed.
Chris nodded pleasantly. They re-
turned  the salute. It was always
right with the boys if Chris had them
in charge.
Ralph and Pearl enjoyed Lee's ac-
count of the race, and urged him as
ever, to be if possible, as generous and
brave as Uncle Chris.
CHAPTER XIX.
ONLY AS FRIENDS.
War's rude scars are healing. The
ex-soldiers have met time and again
at the sacred glebe where death holds
truce between the blue and gray.
The politicians are fighting with an
energy of bluster, that if sincere,
would have shamed the valor of a
Lee, McLellan, Hancock or Hampton.
Peace with gentle influence has
striven to reconcile a common brother-
hood. Prosperity again scatters its
blessings.
Hal opens her window blinds on a
glorious spring morning. The green
marsh is undulating soft as a slope of

Canaan, as the tide sweeps through
rippling and noiseless.
The beardy oaks shade the area
which is devoted to the boat houses
and landing. The cattle are scatter-
ing over the rich pasture ground,
Colts and lambs frisk and browse to-
gether. The negro song floats clear
and blithe over the horseshoe cove
between the listing ground and home.
The air is laden with odors of the
oppoppinax, orange, jessamine and
honeysuckle.
The eye feasts to langour on the
brilliant azalias and peerless japonica.'
.A   rallying chorus is sent from tree
to tree by the mockingbird as he
stands guard over his nesting ma',
The thrush tries its note to rival the
master song he hears.
The blue dove coos and fceds close
under the window sills.
On the river bank, the white c-nie
with bayonet beak, stands in the silver
stream ready to peck its prey.
The waters gleam and plash as the
schools of minnows flee the blowing
porpoise.
It is a spring morning of the low
country in South Carolina. Nature
empties its treasure trove to every
sense.
Hal sees,-and a thanks-giving per
vades her soul as the Easter time r   '
curs to her mind.
She reaches to pluck a bunch rose
that almost touches her window shut
ter. There is a slip of paper fastened
to the   rose.  It is removed. The
blinds are closed.
She opens and reads. One hand is
pressed until the finger tips are bloo(1-

eps on his sleeve. Brantly sat at the
foot of the bed, Pearl and Ralph were
at a window. Mrs. St. Clair was
mixing a powder, the lads, Lee and
Stuart peeped in at the door.
"We've both suffered, she said. I
loathed you yesterday, to-day, you are
my confidant."
Another pleasant smile played ou
his face. "What a victory?"
Another pause ensues. "She finds
her mother's ring --."
Mrs. St. Clair chokes back a sob as
she places crushed ice on his forehead.
"Her true name! Her grandfather!
Her mother's grave! She is safe."
He is quiet again.
"Brantly!" he calls, after a pause
of several minutes.
"Here I am Chris! Do you know
me?"
The Colonel took the burning band
of his friend.
"I'd cram the lie down the throat,
of him who would asperse you.
You'll forgive? -."
Brantly squeezed the hot hand.
"Good! You were always true as
steel."
Now succeeded a half hour of rest,
when with a spring and sweep of his
arm, he feebly called out, "At em
boys! Two to one, charge! Ya, ya,
ya!"
The effort prostrated him to utter
weakness as with a gasp he fell back
on the pillow. Brantly returned to
his seat with a deep sigh. Mrs. Sr.
Clair touched the scout's lips with
brandy.
The eyes opened slowly and for a
few seconds brightened.
"Stuart's in! Forward,   forward!
Custer the fop! White rag! tone bead
more! Game's up."
Ralph strolled on the piazza. The
'last fight recurred(to him.
"Don't race boys! Bet., will you?

Let me catch     you at it! Lee and
Stuart, my lads, be gentlemen as your
fathers are."
The lads darted away to hide their
sobbings.
Another pause of quiet, succeeds,

ers. His eyes are closed but the lips
move.   A peaceful smile rests on his
countenance What is it that brings
a lull to the fevered brain? He is
musing with the unseen. Ask the
invisible waiting ones at the death.
bed! There are no tinkling footfallsof
cherubs on the floor. Only a deep,
heavy, fevered breathing. Yet, he is
calm. May    not some spirit being
then have whispered, "She is near."
Now   his great, dark sunken eyes
open. He    takes Hal's hand which
has gently touched his forehead with
ice. "1 knew you'd be here!"
He took Mrs St Clair's hand, (she
stood next to Hal,) and held together
hers and Hal's.
"Brantly!" he called, with a faint
voice. The Colonel approached. The
dying soldier reached for Brantly s
hand and placed it above the two al-
ready in his grasp.
"Friends,  eh!   Forgiven?"   He
gazed in Brantly's eyes.
"Yes, dear Chris!     Friends all
round."
"Hal, do you hear that? I told
you. we'd win the fight. Friends all
round you Hal !"
The weakening fingers slowly re-
laxed as each hand was gently with-
drawn. The usually earnest, alnolt
severe contraction   of  the   throw,
smoothed and softened to a peaceful
repose. At quick intervals a smile
lit the expression telling of a plea-inL
strain of fitful meditation. The 11nrt
was growing apace so gently, that the
stars beyond awaiting him, were a-

I

most in sight. After a half hour he
spoke again.
"The lads; train them well ! It
takes two years for a lawn, but genera-
tions for a gentleman. Hal, you've a
clever duty before you! Those boys
and misses-."
Hal touched   his hand   tenderly
while she choked back her sobbings.
He recognized the touch.
"Hal !" he whispered feebly, "On
guard! I knew it. Just a word brave
soul, then-."
She bowed her head to his lips, as
she took his quivering fingers in hers.
"Farewell,  brave  Hal! Farewell.
We meet, we part! We pass and seem,
only, as friends."- "Only, as friends."
Hal sank to a chair burying a
weeping face at his side. He rested
for an other hour,  ut the clammy
forehead t Id the near enc. Sdden-
ly he roused   with a paroxysm of
strength and ordered:
"Steady, wait for the word! Ai,
fire."

Brantly's lips compress. He recalls
the past.
The dying man's eyes seek anxions-
ly around; Hal is near him. She
feels an eloquent pressure of the hand;
The  last.  "Still  there!  Goodbye
