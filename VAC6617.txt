REALITY; OR, A HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE. There's not a day, but to the man of thought, Betrays some secret, that throws new reproach On life, and makes him sick of seeing more. YOUNG. For what is life? At best a brief delight; A sun, scarce brightening ere it sinks in night; A flower, at morning fresh, at noon decay'd; A still szoift river, gliding into shade. SPANISH. Well, well-the world must turn upon its axis, And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails; And live and die, make love and pay our taxes, And, as the veering wind shifts, shiftou sails.

JOHNSON, OH! if thou wouldst know, gentle reader, what human miseries are, turn thine eyes upon the mighty city, and there behold, stretched before thy startled gaze, an endless mask of hypocrisy and deceit, under which grow moral sores and canker- ings and corruptions of the body politic; and where, in spite of Protean guise, withering taints and leprosies are crushing the hearts and love of thousands and thousands of our fellow beings in the very face of a just and living God. Much has been said and written concerning the trials and sorrows of the poor, yet how little does the great world know of the secret sufferings that rack the bodies and chill the souls of the unfortunate in the very midst of this christian city I What of the poor needle women whose inheritance is but the cruel destiny of a laborious life, without ever tasting of the joys of plenty, or resting for a sin- gle moment on the lap of ease? Aye, hearken to the- piercing wails of the wretched seamstress, who writhes in hopeless despair, and lives but to suffer in frightful want, and let thine heart melt with pity. Think of the friendless, helpless, and hun-   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     7 gry female operative, who, by incessant labor, sacrifices the vigor of her body, blights the blos- som of her once rosy cheek, and lets in pale mel- ancholy ills to corrode and lacerate the heart, while the voracious worm of a consumptive dis- ease is burrowing to the home of death in the liver or the lungs, and preparing her for an early grave. Contemplate the sorrows of the abject daughter of toil, who after months-years--of pain, suffering, and privation, sinks emaciated into the arms of death, and goes down to the silent tomb where alone the poor have peace, and in mental agony you will ejaculate, Alas! alasl But listen to a true story of real life: The hoarse, cold winds of December had breathed upon the waters of the Hudson, and they were frozen. The forests, which only a few short monrths before were clothed in green foliage, now seemed as barren and sterile as the lava-crust- ed sides of old Chimborazo. The trees, where in youth I gathered nuts with my schoolmates, and cheated the squirrels of their coveted store, had once more yielded up their products to another generation of girls and boys. The leaves had long since withered and fallen; the birds had for- saken us, and were singing in more southern climes; the fields which were luxuriant with wav- ing grain, lay bare; the flocks had been gathered into the fold to be fed from the garnered crops;     8       REALITY; OR, A the scythe and the sickle, the plow and the har- row, had all been placed away, for summer was dead, and winter-cold, bleak, and pitiless winter, reigned. Little ragged urchins who were revel- ing in loose garments when the weather was warm, now found it necessary to draw their mean ap-- parel tighter around them to keep out the frosty air. To the poor and dependent in large cities, win- ter is always an unwelcome visitor. The squalid misery of destitution and want renders their con- dition painfully severe, because they have less opportunity to provide themselves against the urgent necessities of life, and the keen, cold, and inclement state of the weather. To such, winter is always a sort of gloomy Hades-a period of suffering, when humanity is overburdened with those " ills which flesh is heir to," and when the instincts of philanthropy should be taxed to their utmost to cheer and console the afflicted. *  *  **    *  *  *  * As I moved along the fashionable promenade of the city one bitter cold day, securely wrapped within my thick mantle and heavy furs, "to see and to be seen," (as others do,) there stood weeping near the curbstone, two children of tender years. The larger, a fair haired boy whose infantile stature and baby-like face pronounced him scarce- ly five summers old, affectionately clasped the   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     9 tiny hand of his companion, a girl, evidently his sister, and at least a year younger. Both stood there in the passing throng, shivering in rags that but illy screened their little bodies from the win- try blast, apparently observed by none. The little boy now and then raised his tearful eyes to the faces of those who journeyed along, as if im- ploring charity, yet neither alms, nor looks, nor words of pity were given. In despair he burst forth with a fresh flood of tears, and sobbing as though his little heart would break, hugged his companion closer to him than before. Among the multitude 'tis true there were some who cast upon the children a look of enquiry, but even' that seemed more from curiosity than the prompt- ings of sympathy. Although accustomed to see- ing the beggar by the way-side, there was some- thing so unusual in this spectacle, that it led me to stoop down and demand the caul. "Mama is sick," sobbed the boy, whose tears quickly began to dry with hope-"Ma is so sick that she can't work any more, and sis and I so hungry." "And so cold, too, ma'am," lisped the younger child, with a convulsive shiver and a chattering of her teeth that would have pierced a heart of stone. And perceiving how thin their ragged garments were, it surprised me that they had not already perished.      10      REALITY ; OR, A "Yes, ma'am," continued the boy, wiping his face with his apron sleeve and looking eagerly into my eyes-"We are so cold and hungry, ma'am, please-do please give us some money for mama-- wo't you?" By this time quite a number of persons likewise stopped, and a crowd soon gathered about that hemmed me in. The next moment a surly police- man elbowed his way through, and catching the children by their arms, thought to drag them away as vagrants. lHe looked like a cruel man, and I could not bear to witness his rough inten- tions, thereupon I bade him desist. "How!-Dare you interfere with an officer in the discharge of his duty, madam?" exclaimed the policeman, in a consequential tone. "No," I replied. "But as the very tender age of these children claims more than a passing notice, it is my intention to discover where they live, and if possible better their condition -" "Oh, as to that, I can soon inform you," inter- rupted the officer with a sneer. "But you'd bet- ter save your money than be fooling it away on the like of these." The children shrank back from the rough man as he spoke, and clung to my skirts for protection, which I had firmly resolved to give them. His pride was touched by my interference, and wishing to make his prowess seem undoubted in the eyes   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     " of the multitude, he put on a fierce, scowling air and spoke tauntingly to me in return. But his calculations were wrongly made, for several voices loudly uttered denunciations. There was then a clamor in my favor, and seeing that I was determined, the fellow at length relinquished their custody. Full of sudden joy, the poor little creatures almost forgot the cold that pinched their flesh, as with much lighter hearts they now led the way to the abode of their sick mother. A portion of the crowd proceeded to accompany me, and not wishing to make myself further conspicuous, I entered the house of an acquaintance near at hand, taking the children with me, whereupon those who fol- lowed went their way. However, before leaving my friend's house, I took good care to have the children provided with food, which they speedily devoured while warming at the fire. Poor things  their hands and feet had been so very cold, that when the heat began to operate upon them, they were for some time in the most excruciating pain. Yet my friend's husband persisted in believing that the children were but the instruments of some wicked wretch, who (as it often happens) obliged them to beg upon a false pretence. He advanced the most plausible arguments in favor of our sharing his suspicions, but his estimable wife, my friend, took quite an interest inthe little sufferers, and we set off together in quest of their mother.     12      REALITY; OR, A In a small court or alley leading from an obscure street, in a neighborhood inhabited almost entirely by the lowest grade of humanity, we found a wooden hovel so dilapidated in outward appear- ance that we felt some hesitation in entering, lest it should tumble down upon us. Suspicious-faced men, dirt begrimmed, and wretchedly clothed, gazed at us, and miserable half starved women and children likewise eyed us from broken windows. We began to feel half afraid, and had not our little guides fairly pulled us along, we might have retraced our steps quicker than we came. "This is the door," said the little boy. It was indeed there, but had long since dropped from its hinges, and now stood leaning against the opening, so that by pushing back one side we slipped through into a very dirty hall that was entirely empty, and which from its length, proved the old house to be far larger than we imagined from an exterior view in front. Passing along we descended to the yard in the rear, at the further end of which there was a smaller tenement. The children quickened their pace, and the little boy cried out-"There it is, there's where mama lives." "Yes, there's where she lives," exultingly chimed his sister in her baby accents, and breaking away from us, they both ran with all their might to tell their mother of our approach. A cramped staircase led us to the second floor,   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     13 and the next instant we were at the bedside of the destitute invalid, who, much surprised at our visit, endeavored to speak, but / her strength was insufficient for the excitement of the occasion, and with a tremulous gasp she sank senseless upon her meagre pillow. The poor little children, whose faces beamed joy and delight a moment before, now uttered the most frantic screams, believing from what they saw that their beloved parent was no longer alive. The piercing cries of the children for the instant well nigh bewildered us, but fortunately their lamentations brought consciousness back to the mother, who in a short time recovered sufficiently to answer a few questions, from which it appeared that for some days past they had subsisted on a few dry crusts of bread that a neighboring ne- gro woman's generosity prompted her to spare from her own scanty supply. The apartment wherein the sick mother lay contained all they possessed--which consisted only of a very miserable mattrass of hair placed upon a rickety cot in one corner-a couple of thin blankets, a quilt, and a slender pillow-a much worn pine table, three paintless chairs--a trunk half full of ragged wearing apparel-a few cook- ing utensils, and a fluid lamp. There was neither fire nor so much as a stove. In this one dismal chamber there was revealed to 2     "      REALITY; OR, A our eyes more than enough to convince even the most doubtful that no false pretence had sent the children out to beg. Instead of the base, design- ing wretch pictured by the suspicions of my friend's husband, we beheld the living skeleton of sickness and want--a sight never to be effaced from our memory, and one that ought to be eter- nally stamped in the daily thoughts and nightly dreams of the loud-talking reformers of the age, who feel so deeply with the tongue, but who never give save when the ace will make a noise in the public journals, and create a kind of glory to eulogize their names. We were glad to leave the cheerless abode of misery, and hastened away in search of better lodgings for the poor mother and her little ones. The case was sadly urgent, and before night, we succeeded in removing the whole family to a com- fortable room in a more respectable quarter of the city. The inhabitants of the locality whence we took them were not a little curious though, and it required considerable tact to avoid their imperti- nence. However, their final conclusion was that we must be related to the unfortunate woman, and had come to perform our duty. A physician having come, we were assured that with proper care and nutritious food the invalid might in time get well. And in a few days there were the most gratifying symptoms of a speedy   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     15 recovery. Indeed, the whole family were so much improved by their change of circumstances, that it was somewhat difficult to identify the now clean and tidily dressed children, with the weeping babes of sorrow who so lately shivered in the cold street imploring charity of the well clad passers-by. My friend and I left nothing undone that might contribute to their comfort, and calling to our aid several acquaintances, together we nursed the sick mother and provided for her helpless offspring, with such effective consideration that in less than two weeks, our patient had gained strength enough to enable her to converse quite freely, without ex- periencing much exhaustion. In compliance with our request, she finally com- municated the outlines of her- HISTORY OF LIFE. "My age is nearly twenty-three," she began pressing her handkerchief to her eyes because of the tears that forced their way from an overflowing fountain of sorrow. "You will scarcely believe it though, judging from the withered wreck before you. Ah! the hand of affliction has fallen heavily upon me-and yet I must not complain now that so many kind friends have snatched me, as it were, from the horrors of starvation." A pause followed, during which she gazed alter. nately upon her babes with mournful tenderness,     16      REALITY; OR, A and upon us with looks of gratitude. A deep sigh was some relief, and she resumed: Her childhood she remembered as a sweet and happy dream, for then neither care nor trouble dampened the joys she felt. Being an only child, her parents very naturally desired that she should have the fullest advantages of education and refinement, which their abundant means easily procured. Until she arrived at the age of fourteen, not a single cloud had in any way darkened her bright expectations; but about this time, from some pecuniary embarrassments that threatened to involve her beloved father in serious trouble, she was unexpectedly removed from the seminary where it had been intended she should remain and finish her education. The difficulty assumed a still more disastrous shape than even her father at first anticipated, which caused him to decide upon quitting the place where they then lived, and seek- ing a new home among strangers. So from a quiet country town they removed to the city, where for a time all went along as smoothly as their altered circumstances would permit. But at length her dear mother (whose health, being delicate at best, had been seriously shattered by reverse of for- tune and consequent neglect of friends) fell sick and died. It was a sad blow for her poor father, and she being frantically inconsolable, also tended to increase his wretchedness, until he finally sank   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     17 into a silent melancholy that saddened his face for the remainder of his life. Meanwhile she had made the acquaintance of a young man, that:soon ripened into love, and on the day that she was seventeen they were united in marriage. Her husband was poor, but held a situation as book keeper in a mercantile house of much impor- tance, where his salary was fully sufficient to pro. vide for all the little comforts of their humble household. Her father continued to sojourn with them until some time after the birth of their first child, when the old man's health began to decline very rapidly, and he soon went to join her mother in the world to come. Bereft of her parents, and having the responsible duties of a wife and mother to perform, she was now -fairly launched upon the tide of human events. That dear mother and beloved father whose only hope she had been for so many years, were no longer at her side ready to comfort and guide her. She fully comprehended the irrepar- able extent of her loss, but nerved by the mater- nal affection her own child claimed, and encour- aged by the tender love of her devoted husband she found consolation in future hopes. In consequence of the very good opinion entertained for her husband by his employers, he was admitted into partnership as a member of 2     18       REALITY; OR, A their firm. Their prospects were brightening every day, and in the fullness of cheering thrift they were blest with a second child. They had now a boy and a girl, and with grateful emotion she offered up prayerful thanks to the Supreme Giver of all things, and shed tears of inexpressible joy.  She was a happy mother and a fond wife; and oh! how pleasant it was after the business of each day was over, and her husband hastened to the sanctuary of their peaceful dwelling, to enjoy the calm and refreshing moments of rest There, secluded from the noise and tumult of a troubled world, they realized in their hearts' affection, those pure, unadulterated, and chastened pleasures which not all the pride and honors of wealth can give. Anxiously she awaited his coming, and never failed to hail his arrival with a smile of pleasure and a kiss of joy. The offspring of their wedded love, whose tendrils were entwined about their hearts, also outstretched their feeble arms to wel- come his embrace. Yet they did not forget the sober, serious reflection that their earthly Eden was not their final home; they endeavored to pre- pare for a holier Paradise above. But the fiend of darkness hovered near. The elevation of her husband to a partnership with his employers brought him into the society of many dissipated men, who, notwithstanding their /                   -     I HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     19 good name "on change," were totally devoid of principle and morality in their private life, and whose leisure hours were too often spent among the infamous and abandoned. At first he en- deavored to shun them, but the established dram- drinking habits of his neighbors coerced him into the occasional indulgence of a social glass. Indeed there was no other way--he must drink if he ex- pected to have and retain the easy good will of his associates in the dealings and barterings of the day. Then there were the free lunches staring him in the face when he began to feel hungry. Of course he must drop in at the saloon hard by, and try a plate of turtle soup, clam chouder, or some other made dish, so thoroughly impregnated with spices and seasoning as to create a most violent thirst. And then the lunch being free, it would really be the lowest meanness to go without patronizing the bar. This would only aggravate the devouring thirst, for the villanous liquors measured out at these places are never any of the best. Instead of feeling refreshed, the victim too often swallows the fatal serpent that, once within, seldom fails to deeply fix its deadly fangs into the well-being of many an upright man. Then there are other in. fluences common enough among our merchants-- and equally as common among other classes too-- influences from causes hardly seen in the light of day. Midnight diversions--games and gaming---     20      REALITY; OR, A and nocturnal perigrinations to the haunts and the abodes of the abandoned, where champagne and wine, together with the arts and wiles of adepts in sin, prepare the germs of poison fatal to the bright hopes or domestic peace oqiundreds of mothers and wives, and perhaps sisters. Alas! there are innumerable ways of ruining the best business and blasting the fairest name by the fatal curse of intemperance in all large cities. At first it may be "just a single glass"--"a mere drop, not enough to hurt a mouse "--but then the drops grow larger and the glasses are more frequent, un- til the habit has become a seated evil. And thus it was with her husband, who had never used in- toxicating drink previous to his elevation in busi- ness. He did try to avoid any excess; but one evening he returned to his dwelling somewhat later than usual, his breath for the first time smelling of the alcoholic poison, and she permit. ted herself, in the haste of the moment, to utter a sharp rebuke, which so stung his sensitive nature, that in a rash spirit of resentment he immediately left the house, and did not return until nearly morning. During his absence she did little but weep, for this was the first symptom of estrangement they had experienced since their marriage. She bit- terly reproached herself for having been so hasty, and would have given anything had she taken a   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     21 gentler course to express her sorrow for his liba- tion. Yet, allowing the perversity of a wrong impulse to govern her, she still manifested indig- nation--for his long absence irritated her so much that she could not smother the state of her feelings. Furthermore, she quickly perceived that he had been drinking again. That night they retired without a word passing between them. Nor was there any prospect of a reconciliation the next morning, as they both continued to har- bor more or less resentment, and he went forth to the counting house without bestowing his usual tokens of affection towards her or their children. It proved a wretched day for her. She had ample time to pout and cry to her heart's content, from which she gradually sank into a deep reverie that brought vividly before her mental vision the full sense of impending danger. Sober reflection pointed out the evil results sure to arise from estrangement, and plainly revealed to her startled mind how it was possible that she might become the wife of a drunkard. The perversity of her feelings now instantly vanished, and she began to anxiously desire her husband's return, fully re- solved to throw herself into his arms and implore forgiveness. It was near their dinner hour; and every moment she expected to hear his footsteps in the hall. Oh how she longed .for his ap- proach! and full of the tenderest love and repen-     22      REALITY; OR, A tance, she felicitated herself on a happy reconcilia- tion. The clock struck-the hour had passed- still he did not come. Every moment seemed ar age. She almost counted the ticking of the time- piece on the mantle, and breathlessly listened, but no husband came. What could it portend? Had anything serious happened? Perhaps h  was seized with sudden illness-might be dying, and she not there to administer aid or relief. Surely, some fatality had occurred, else he would come. Thus she vaguely surmised the cause of his ab- sence, in all the agony of torturing doubts and fears, until the clock proclaimed the lapse of an- other hour. She could no longer endure the sus- pense that filled her mind with such vague dis- traction, and frantically rushed into the street almost flying to the counting house to enquire for her husband. He was not there- nor had he been since the day beforeI Se interrogated his partners and the employees, one and all, but to no purpose. Her anxiety was now doubled. She would have rushed-no matter where, so that she could have found the beloved object of her solicitude and search. As it was, she could only retrace her steps, and returning home she threw herself down ^4o weep. Evening came, but it brought no hus- band to dispel- her grief. It was long past mid- night, when, with bleared face and blood-red eyes,   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     23 the idol of her heart's first love came reeling home, andy slipping on the threshold, sprawled his length updn the floor. The shock came like a whirlwind of horror, and for a moment she could hardly re- tain her senses--her heart grew sick--a convul- sive shudder crept over her--and, completely over- whelmed with conflicting emotions, she clutched the wall for support. The dreadful reality sent a palsying chill of horror through her that seemed to freeze the blood in her veins, as, with bewilder- ed reason, she stood gasping for breath. Ohl what dismal clouds came rushing upon her half oblivious understanding, and with an electrical thrill shed a withering blight, that crushed the fondest and purest yearnings of her soul 1 Yet he was her husband, and that recollection quickly banished all else from her mind. He was her first and her only love--her protector and her guide, and with all a woman's best sympathies alive, she speedily assisted him to rise. The ac- cursed poison had done its worst. Completely stupefied, and totally unable to stand or sit, she helped him to bed, and then lay down by his side to weep until his natural reason should return. Words cannot describe the mental suffering she endured. 'But when he awoke she did not chide him; she gently administered to his sober wants and pondered how she might win him back by kindness and attention. She threw her arms     24       REALITY; OR, A around his neck, and, with a heaving bosom, tear- ful eyes, and an almost bursting heart, in the soft and tender strains of love and mercy, she appealed to his reflective senses and long-cherished affec- tion. She gently pointed out the fatal conse- quences of inebriety, and implored him to forever abandon a habit that with vicious companions must inevitably drag him into the vortex of ever- lasting ruin. She whispered ii his ear her unal- terable sympathy and devotedness as a wife. She pointed to his children-those pledges of their happy love, and begged, and entreated, and prayed him to reform for them. His heart was moved, and feeling the sting of guilt and shame, his soul was subdued, and mingling his tears with hers he bathed her bosom with the glittering emblems of deep repentance. Hope again began to dawn. But alas! he for- got his solemn covenant, and, in spite of the min- istering influence of her love, would be persuaded by his reckless associates to choose the haunts of dissipation and vice, rather than his quiet home. She endeavored to conceal as far as possible his deep disgrace, yet he was infatuated; and bursting the bonds of affection, he rushed headlong into debauchery; and burying every noble feeling in voluptuousness and inebriety, he went on in brutal debasement till hope hid its head in sackcloth,   HISTORY OP HUMAN LIFE.     25 and pity seemed palsied in mournful contempla- tion of ruin irreversibly decreed. Night after night he went reeling home from his debaucheries, filled with wine and inflamed with passion; but, although he abused her kind- ness and mocked her prayers, she continued to treat him with the same unalterable tenderness and undying affection as though he were the best of husbands. She saw his rapid march to ruin, and vainly endeavored to arrest his career. But the die was cast Her inebriate husband no longer retained the confidence of his partners, and was forced to relinquish his position with them. By his expulsion from the firm, their means of subsistence likewise vanished, nor could he even obtain a subordinate post in another house--for his character was entirely blasted, and no one de- sired to employ a profligate, a hopeless drunkard. Thus from the brightest prospects and happy content, they were reduced to actual want. What they had was soon consumed by her husband, who, to supply his bacchanalian demands, dis- posed of their remaining personal effects, till they were entirely destitute of a dwelling, and suffter ing for food. The friends they had likewise turned away their faces, and, with two children in her arms, she must either find a refuge in the almshouse, or go forth and wander in the streets to beg for work. 3     26      REALITY; OR, A In this dire emergency, one of her husband's late partners-" . Delmaine-took compassion on h r.  a  vided them with shelter at his own cost, and offered her employment. They were extensive manufacturers of clothing for a wholesale trade, and consequently it was an easy matter to give her as much sewing as she could finish under the disadvantages of her situation. With two small children, one still on her knee, and the other just beginning to run about, she found it a very difficult and tedious matter to ply her needle to advantage. To nurse her children and wait on a drunken husband, left little oppor- tunity to earn means for their support. However, the assistance of Delmaine was not stinted, for over and above the small amount she earned by the labor of her hands, he gave her enough to keep them in food. -   I Delmaine continued his liberality, and in the gratitude of her heart it was some time before she suspected anything wrong. Bat at length his manner assumed an ardor that opened her eyes to the true drift of his intentions. Instead of the humane and generous benefactor she had believed him, she now discovered Del- maine to be a designing hypocrite, whose hard heart gloried only in dissimulation. She saw that all his seeming goodness and proffered sympathy had not been intended so much to afford relief as   IISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     27 to securely pave the way, under "charity's cloak," to the consummation of a sinister wish. The pinch- ing necessities of her destitute condition, with only the palsied arm of a weak husband debased and besotted with inebriety to lean upon for de- fence, rendered her, in the facinorous eyes of Del- maine, fit and easy prey to feed his passion. He had thought to first work upon her feelings by manifestations of pity, and then through the in- strumentality of golden bribes, in the dark and trying hour of want, to secure her compliance with his will. It was not enough that she should have been made a drunkard's wife, and compelled to toil for the support of her family, bereft of even the solace of a confiding friend--for upon her poverty and disgrace the world quickly turned its back-- but in the depth of her sorrow and woe, the only dependence left actually served to drag her still nearer the verge of despair. But affliction's fangs began to inure her senses to disappointment, and with scarce a buoyant hope she tried to be recon- ciled to the trials of her miserable lot. Yet, rather than continue to receive the charity of Delmaine, and tolerate his approach, she resolved to risk the chances of finding subsistence from other hands. The rooms they occupied had been hired by him, and the labour of her needle was for his store, so that they were almost wholly depend-     28      REALITY; OR, A ent on him for not only shelter but even bread. To obtain either advice or assistance from her hus- band was impossible, for the ale house kept him absent, or sent him staggering home worse than helpless, to curse her for the affection she still of- fered to retrieve him from sinking into an outcast's grave. Yet this was not all the affliction in store for her, for while she was contriving how to escape the persecutions of Delmaine, a party of police- men came to arrest her husband on a charge of felony, and full of ire and malignant zeal, they also insisted upon seizing her. They were dragged to prison. Her husband lodged in one cell, and she with her babes in another. The charge was theft. She desired to know who the prosecutor was, and the jailer told her "Delmaine." Her husband denied the accusa- tion, but they refused to allow her to speak to him, alleging that she was necessarily his accomplice, and so kept them apart. She had not been in prison long when Delmaine gained admission to her cell, and there renewed his overtures of dishonor. She ordered him hence, but he only laughed at her in return; for, having bribed the turnkey, he was permitted to remain as long as he wished to. He related to her how her husband had purloined goods from their store and pawned them for the means to buy rum, which   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.    29 could be proven upon the trial. Conviction must certainly follow, he argued, and the consequence would be at least a sentence of one year or more in the State Prison. It was yet possible to avert the impending doom of her husband, which could easily be done by the plaintiff withdrawing the charge, or not appearing agaings him at the trial. Delmaine said he could at any moment release them both from prison, and restore them to liberty. And in the excess of her anguish she earnestly be- sought him to use his influence in their behalf. This he would immediately do upon one condition, the bare recollection of which made the wretched woman shudder as she related the story. Finding that she was resolute, her persecutor departed, promising to call the next day, when he believed she would most likely be prepared to give him a different answer. Enough had been divulged by him to satisfy her mind that the charge preferred against her husband was but part of a deep laid scheme concocted to accomplish his purpose. Her husband was therefore really innocent, but by a pre-arranged net-work of evidences, it would be an easy matter to prove him. guilty, which Del- maine had determined should work out his evil design. These facts were clear enough to her under- standing, but she had neither friends nor money I  to use in her own behalf. And had the truth been    3* *     30       REALITY; ORf A proclaimed to the world through the newspapers, few would have given credence to such a story. She told the jailer how she was wronged, yet he scarcely deigned to listen,and when shehadfinished he only shrugged his shoulders in such a way as seemed to express indifference. Delmaine was re- puted wealthy, and none cared to utter insinuations to his discredit. Moreover, her husband was looked upon in the light of a common vagrant, whom it would be a blessing to society to have put out of the way. And as the wife and children of a vagrant, she with her babes were esteemed little better than so many brutes for every heartless wretch to maltreat and spit upon. That they were even half human, or had feelings like the better favored by fortune, did not for a moment enter the callous minds of the attaches of the prison, and they had to take their chances with real criminals, whose crimes, if not their virtues, secure them at least some degree of importance. The unfortunate who finds himself restrained within the walls of a city prison, and having not the wherewithal to hire the services of the heart- less attaches, must abide his fate without the least show of sympathy or aid. Should he have only a little gold, aye, even a bit of silver, some lacquey or hardened keeper will pause to hear his story, and, perchance, render a paltry favor. If there is money plenty, there will be enough to offer   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     31 condolence, and pledge themselves body and soul in whatever may be required. But when the money is gone, the hirelings are ready to vanish. A lawyer may offer aid if he can but get the watch, the coat, or in fact the shirt of the prisoner, but should there be no plunder, then the law alone must respond to the groans of the victim. How many miserable creatures have been robbed of even the clothes on their backs, by some petty lawyer, in hopes of gaining their release from prison, who have been left to shiver in their cells without a single effort being made in their behalf! The plunder finds its way to the pawnbrokers, and the small loans thus obtained go to swell up the large fortunes, not unfrequently amassed by these vampires of the legal profession. A murderer or' other malefactor, whose crimes have startled a whole nation, is received and treated by the jailers as a distinguished guest, and all unite in gazing at his wicked face with the most profound regard-they actually show the felon respect; but should a poor widow woman steal a loaf of bread to appease the hunger of her starving children she is thrust into a cell with a rude shove and a coarse jeer. She gets only contempt-compassion or pity she never re- ceives. A wholesale swindler, whose frauds may have ruined a thousand, would be entitled to a strip of brussels carpet to protect his foot soles from the cold flag stone floor of his cell-a curled     32       REALITY; OR, A hair mattress-lights at night, and the entire free, dom of exercising his limbs up and down the public corridors, when the other prisoners are close under locks and bars. His meals can be se- lected from the bill of fare sent from the best cafd in all the city. There need be nothing wanting, save liberty and more commodious apartments, to gratify his bodily wants. The keepers give them- selves no uneasiness about his safe custody-he is of too much importance-he is somebody in the world, and a lion in prison. Then again, such men as Delmaine can easily enough discover how to gain admission to a particular cell whenever it suits their notion. It does not cost much to bribe an unprincipled subordinate, whose salary alone is inadequate to meet the expenses of his personal living. But Delmaine had enemies, notwith- standing. In the cell next to the mother and her babes, was a woman who had been incarcerated for some alleged misdemeanor, and whose discharge was hourly expected. This woman overheard the pro- posal of Delmaine, and she afterwards took pains to communicate the fact that she not only knew a great deal concerning him, but would make an effort to thwart him, as soon as she obtained her own liberty. The mother entertained no favorable opinion of this woman, yet her situation was too desperate to let the least hope of assistance pass   HISTORY OF IHUMAN LIFE.    33 unimproved. Accordingly she expressed thanks for her proffered aid, and moreover besought her to do all she could for the sake of her husband and babes. The woman manifested the bitterest anti- pathy for Delmaine, freely intimating that she would also be revenged for grievances long ago experienced from his machinations, and this fact inclined the mother to place some reliance on her sincerity. E   A discharge soon came for the woman who promised to thwart Delmaine. Her time of thral- dom had expired, and bidding the persecuted mother be of good spirits, she hurried away. Yet it was a long suspense to lie there in that dismal vault of masonry and solid stone, with hardly a ray of hope to cheer her through the weary night, while instead of refreshing sleep she exhausted herself in nursing a sick child. Had she not been a mother she would willingly have died, but maternal affection was too strong in her breast to entirely despair. Delmaine returned according to his promise, but finding her as steadfast as on the day before, he shortly withdrew, declaring that for such obsti- nacy her husband should suffer all the more. Yet the following day he came again, though all to the same purpose, which, in his chagrin, he bore with manifestations of all the resentment his baseness was capable of conceiving. Thus he     34      REALITY; OR, A continued to come and go for a week, and she had almost reconciled herself to stoically abide the worst that could come to her husband, when she was joyfully surprised to learn from a lawyer, sent to enquire into her case by the woman who offered her aid, that she was at liberty to go when and where she pleased.. He said there had been no complaint made against her at all, and that her arrest and incarceration was really a case of false imprisonment: Mr. Bagshaw, the lawyer, also expressed himself anxious and ready to forthwith institute legal proceedings against her persecutor, by which, he warmly argued, she would undoubt- edly recover enormous damages. But she was too glad to escape from that horrid sepulchre of the living to trouble herself about the legality of her imprisonment. She preferred securing the libera- tion of her husband. Yet this was no easy undertaking. Mr. Bagshaw shook his head very gravely, but said nothing. However he would see what he could do. He hinted that his wisdom and experience in the mysteries of the law might be depended upon, and expressed the most em- phatic assurances that if he failed it would be utterly useless for any body else to try. Alto- gether Bagshaw seemed a very clever sort of man. Having obtained her own freedom, she could not rest without at least seeing her husband, where-   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     35 upon Bagshaw directed her to leave the prison and then return as a visitor. She did so, and met Bagshaw at the entrance waiting to escort her to the door of her husband's cell. And most fortu- nate it was that he waited, for the door-keeper objected to her passing, and would have sent her away but for the lawyer's intercession in her be- half. She found her husband perfectly sober, and their interview was of such a nature that even Bagshaw's eyes were moistened with tears. He declared the spectacle was sad. Yet, in the midst of her grief, she could not help feeling some plea- sure in knowing that while there in his cell her hus- band would be free from drunkenness. What if he should thus be redeemed from the loathsome and destructive habit? she inwardly reasoned. If so, then she might yet be happy. Here was some encouragement to hope, and when she had parted from him, she was of lighter heart than she had been before for many a day. Through the assistance of Bagshaw, she found lodgings no great distance from the prison, so as to be near her husband, in order to administer to his wants as much as possible. But Delmaine was greatly vexed when he learned of her deliyerance, and soon discovering her whereabouts he continued to persevere in his evil purpose. The cruel man now even went so i       '    -     36       REALITY; OR, A far as to admit that her husband was innocent, but that unless she tolerated his approach, the state prison should be his inevitable doom! But though Delmaine seemed bent on carrying out his monstrous threats, the assurance of her husband's innocence, and the hope of his reclamation from inebriated ruin, yielded her much consolation. Moreover, she counted on the possibility of Bag. shaw's ability to secure her husband's acquittal; and in the face of all the difficulties that encompassed her, she began to indulge in the hope of eventual redemption and happiness for the future. She informed Bagshaw of Delmaine's acknow- ledgment that her husband was innocent, and when she had stated the facts in their true light, the lawyer said he would devise some plan whereby her persecutor might be caught in his own trap. So when Delmaine came again, there were two witnesses secreted in the room, who overheard the wicked man reiterate the innocence of her husband, and repeat his threats to wreak the vengeance he had concocted. This was enough for Bagshaw, who went forth- with to the police court to inform the judge of Delmaine's villany. However, his honor was loath to believe so incredible a story, and accord- ingly deferred acting in the matter until the next day. Meanwhile, Bagshaw set himself to work   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     37 with the full determination of getting Delmaine entangled still more. It happened that there were two officers attached to the police court who had an extraordinary amount of influence with the judge, and this Bag. shaw well knew. Their services were most imp- portant, and they willingly turned "eaves drop- pers" in consideration of each a heavy piece of gold. They were accordingly stowed away in a closet, with the two previous witnesses, to listen to Delmaine when he returned. The monster did i   not know the danger at hand, and in the midst of his confessions the four strong men sprang out and captured him by surprise. Resistance was of no avail, and regardless of remonstrances, en- treaties, and prayers, his captors insisted upon dragging him hence. But Bagshaw wished to have him then and there draw up and sign a paper exculpating her husband, and acknowledging his true motives for the false charge. To this Del- maine stoutly demurred, but when Bagshaw in- timated that it was his only chance of escape, he finally concluded to yield. Bagshaw thereupon dictated, and the document being satisfactorily drawn and signed with the signatures of the four witnesses appended, Delmaine was then com- pelled to go before the judge and testify under oath to its truth. This being done, the culprit thought to go his way, but Bagshaw immediately     38      REALITY; OR, A preferred a charge of perjury, to answer which the prisoner was obliged to enter heavy bail. Bagshaw's stratagem thus brought her hus- band's release from prison, after an unjust incar- ceration of nearly four weeks. During all this time he had not tasted a drop of alcoholic drink, and now expressed himself resolved to abstain from it in future. She was once more comparatively happy. But how to provide for their wants? To be sure her husband was now sober, and might after awhile find employment again as book-keeper; yet as he was suffering severely from bodily ailment con- tracted during his career of dissipation, it was uncertain how long he would be compelled, from that cause, to remain inactive. She had received assistance so far from Bag- shaw, who said that they should not suffer for anything while his client could help them. Upon questioning him, she was not a little surprised to learn that the person to whom he alluded was no other than the woman she had met in the prison, and who promised to aid her, and in doing so re. venge herself upon Delmaine for some cause not clearly explained. Bagshaw further intimated that the woman in question, his client, had abundant means, and that in his opinion they need not feel any delicacy in accepting her bounty, at least till their circum-   IQ,       HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.    89 stances were improved by better fortune. She would have gone and thanked the generous wo- man for her magnanimity, but Bagshaw said she desired her address to remain unknown to them. Fearing Delmaine might try some new mode of annoyance, if they continued in their present lodgings, she sought a place of abode in another quarter of the city, where he would not be likely to find them. She then went in quest of employ- ment for her needle: Her first attempt was un- successful. Again she sallied forth from store to store soliciting work, but failed to get even a pro- mise. And to add to her discouragement, the disease from which her husband was suffering, took a very serious turn, threatening to destroy his life. The physician summoned by Bagshaw to attend, plunged the poor woman into the bit- terest grief, by declaring that a few days must VI  carry her husband to the grave. Nor was the man of medicine mistaken in his conclusion, for the following night the wretched man breathed his last, leaving her to struggle alone, through sorrow and woe. The grave's cold sod fell with a harsh and mourn- ful sound, and when the last shovelful of earth had been heaped over the spot, she frantically clutched her babes close to her aching bosom, and wandered hence with a broken heart. From that     40      REALITY; OR, A hour no smile of joy ever appeared upon her sad countenance. Her sufferings had been too much for her health, and this last great affliction brought a grief that laid her upon a bed of fever. The inmates of the house wherein she lodged, believing her ailment contagious, caused her re- moval to the hospital, where she lay between life and death for a period of three months, during which her children were separated from her, and provided for in a house of charity. When sufficiently recovered, she was told to leave the institution; but being entirely destitute and having no place to call her home, she was given a sum of money by the Superior, who di- rected her where to find her children, and then as- sisted her to procure a lodging. She now resolved to make an effort to get em- ployment from the clothiers, but spent a whole week in fruitless search. At one place they wanted to see a sample of her work, which when produced was, they said, entirely unfit for their trade. Another refused to give out material to an appli- cant unknown to him, and especially to such as could not furnish the best of references as to char- acter. A third had plenty of work that he wanted done very much, yet he could not think of having it spoiled by an inexperienced hand. One declined employing her on the plea that her dress was too   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     41 shabby. "You would be taken for a vagrant by my customers," said he, " and I value the respec- tability of my store too much, to have meanly dressed women entering it. Now go," he added, pointing to the door-" and don't trouble me again, or I may call in the aid of a policeman, and have you taken care of in that way-there, go!" 'In despair she stated to one how she was a widow with two helpless babes, that her husband had died leaving her entirely destitute; and im- plored him to give her employment to provide for their support. "Oh, I dare say," was his sneering reply, "you all have a pitiful story to tell.. Two children, eh? I don't much wonder at it, though, considering what a character the most of you-bear. Ugh! of course their father is dead-that is if they ever had any: but I don't believe a word of it-it's all fabricated to take ad- vantage of my well known philanthropy, so that you may induce me to trust you with the cloth and trimmings which you will take to a pawn- broker's, and I never hear tell of it again." Among them all she did not meet with one who treated her with even common politeness. The principal cause of this lay in her habiliments, which, to tell the truth, were much soiled and the worse for wear. She entered one store and meekly asked one of 4*     42       REALITY; OR, A two elegantly dressed clerks, who were behind the counter, if she could obtain work. "What-scrubbing?" was his quick, sneering answer. He smiled contemptuously, and then seemed to almost bask in the delicious satisfaction of galling her feelings. Then he threw himself into a reclining posture, elevating his heels to the top of the counter, and fixed himself in a comfort, able attitude, with a dainty anticipation of enjoy- ing a little fun. He spoke again, but she was too full of emotion to reply. Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she had not the power to move. Oh! what anguish she felt, how her poor heart ached, and how she choked with the stifling misery that his cruel answer made. She was weary, sick, and ready to sink exhausted in the street, before cros- sing the threshold; but still hoping, she entered, and even while she humbly enquired for employ- ment she was obliged to lean against the counter for support. A great cloud suddenly swept over her and rested its dark mass about her reason. Her body trembled, and there was the paleness of death in her face. The tears gushed from her eyes more and more, and her lip quivered, but still she could not speak. The taunting clerk began to tire of his sport, and would have given something to rid the store of her presence, for he feared she might really swoon there and bring him trouble. Thereupon he   "ISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     43 harshly bade her begone. She made no motion to depart, and he arose to eject her. But his fellow clerk, who had been silent until now, sprang for- ward and said he would see her insulted no more. He hurried to where she stood, only to see her rush into the street. A moment more, and she had disappeared from his sight. That clerk was the only child of a poor widow, whose needle fed and clothed his little body before he learned the ways of the world, and grew to be a man. The spectacle he had been witnessing just then, brought back to his recollection scenes asso- ciated with his infantile days. He thought of his mother who had long since died, and he felt he was not even manly in permitting the wretched wo- man before him to writhe under the cruel sport of his companion. A hundred thoughts flew through' his mind; for well he remembered the thin features-the hollow cheeks, and the sunken eyes of that emaciated mother whose tears had often awakened him from  his childish slumber, by trickling down upon him as he lay on her lap, while she toiled late at night to finish her task. The past was before him, and the vivid remem- brances of what he had seen his own heart-broken mother endure, roused all his better feelings. And thus it was that he differed so oppositely from his companion, who, like the general run of his class, seldom cared to sympathise with the destitute     "      REALITY; OR, A seamrstress--more especially when time and afflic- tion have stripped her of youth and beauty. Alas for the hopes of the disheartened mother l she went home to nurse her babes and sup with desolation and sorrow. But she must have work. The almshouse was a refuge, yet it chilled her to think of going there to lodge. Again she went forth; and as the clothiers refused her employment, she concluded to try the shirt manufacturers, many of whom were women, and she very naturally presumed they would treat her with more kindness, at least, than she had received from the men. But she re- ceived as bad, if not worse, treatment from her own sex. She was not abused so much by rough lan- guage, but in sympathy of feeling they were more deplorably deficient. And as with the tailors, her apparel made a bad impression. Yet the greatest hindrance to obtaining work, was her inexperit ence. Had she been accustomed to such employ- ment, the chances would have been much better. At length she found a Jew who offered her a vest to make, if she would deposit the value of the stuff in his hands as security. ,All the money she had in the world amounted to very little more than he required, and although she absolutely needed it to use, the hope of getting employment induced her to comply with his demand. She flew home, and with all her energy and   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     45 skill she worked most diligently, including a greater part of the night, till the garment was finished, and then hurried back to the Jew, joyous- .- ly anticipating the realization of her moderate wish. Placing her work before the Israelite, he soberly turned it over and over, his countenance, the while, assuming a scowling air, until having wrought himself up to a fiery pitch of rage, the garment went flying across the store and she was completely overwhelmed beneath an avalanche of epithetic abuse. With the most fearful oaths he accused her of having irreparably ruined the vest, and seemed at the point of assaulting her upon the spot, so un- governably did he allow his rage to run. As soon as she could recover from the bewilderment and fright his extraordinary excitement had caused, she offered to make any alterations he might sug- gest, without charge. Thereupon, he not only refused her that privilege, but actually ordered her into the street, declaring that, instead of paying her the price agreed upon, he would now keep the money she had deposited, to compensate him for the damage he pretended was done to the vest. She endeavored to reason the case, and asked him to show her where the damage was, but he only continued to rave and stamp, threatening to eject her by force if she longer remained.     "      REALITY; OR, A Seeing that she would get no pay for what she had done, nor any more work, she begged and implored him to return her money, urging the destitute condition of herself and helpless babes. Prayers nor tears were of any avail. His obdurate heart could feel no pang of guilt nor sense of pity. Avarice governed his impulse, and he cared not how much those in his power writhed in the agonies of want, so long as it made him a profit. The vest was rightly made and well, and of which he had conviction; but he could not forego the opportunity of defrauding her out of the cost of making, and at the same time pocket the amount held as security for its safe return. And in exe- cution of his brutal threat, he pushed her out and closed the door. Notwithstanding the prospects so lately cher- ished, to say nothing of the long and tiresome walks in quest of work, and the labor done for the Jew, her circumstances were now darker than ever before. Added to the trying disappointment of getting no more work, the grievous loss of the little money she had sorely worried her. In- stead of honestly affording relief for her pressing wants, the merciless descendant of Abraham ruth- lessly plunged her deeper into the yawning abyss of dark despair. Sadly she turned down the street, so lost in the intensity of her troubled repining, that before she   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     47 took heed whither she was going, the deep waters of the Hudson rolled at her feet. She was startled at beholding its broad bosom so unexpectedly stretched before her, and wondering why she should have wandered there, she turned to seek her lodg- ings. But a sudden thought seized her. It was the suicide's frenzy. For the first and only time in her life, the demon of darkness now urged her to end her sorrows in voluntary death. It would be but the work of a moment to rush out to the far end of a neighboring pier, and throw herself into the flood beneath-a struggle, and all would be over! The thought no sooner entered her fevered brain, than the fearful resolution came. In obli- vious emotions she was about to stand upon the awful brink of eternity, when the recollection of her darling babes flashed across her tottering rea- son. Uttering a scream, she frantically flew to her lodgings, and catching the little innocents to her heart, she lay down and wept the tedious lapse of many hours away. The strangeness of her conduct created much curiosity in the minds of those who lodged in the same house. And the most curious of all was Mrs. Peabody, the landlady, to whom she frankly divulged the story of her affliction and wrongs, in the hope of enlisting her sympathies, at least suf- ficient to trust her a little longer for the payment     48      REALITY; OR, A ofa week's board, then due. But notwithstanding all she said, the truth of which she attested with sobs and tears, Mrs. Peabody refused to believe her inability to find work. "'Taint possible," replied Mrs. P. with an in- credulous shake of her head. "No, 'taint. Any- body ken git work as wants to. For there's Sally Mungan, and Molly Green, and--and Peggy Laws, and the dear knows how many more that ar been tailoresses ever since I know'd em. They ken git jist as much clothes to make as thev's a mind to,- yes, they ken. Why, 'oney 'tother day, I heerd Peg Laws say as how she was druv half to death, 'cos old what's-his-name, the tailor she works for, wanted twice as many hands as he'd got. Not git sewing to do, hey? That's a likely story to tell; yes 'tis. There's the Sun and Herald, and ain't they allers chock over full of advertisements for people to work, I should like to know? Yes, indeed. And now I think, there's Miss what-you- call-her, up stairs in the back attic, she works for a tailor, too. I never heerd her talk about not gittin' work. No, indeed, she has plenty of it. Ain't she always up before any other body about the house in the morning-and don't she stick to it till after midnight, hardly sparing time to kur to her meals? Didn't I ask her one day, what she stuck so close to her work for, and didn't she say she had to? Yes, indeed she did. Talk about   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.    49 not finding work,-why it's all shaller as dish wa- ter. There's plenty to do for them's a mind to do it." Mrs. Peabody at length paused, and the poor woman once more presumed to crave her indul- gence concerning the amount she owed her, "That's all very well for you," continued Mrs. P., but evidently more inclined to be merciful. "But if I trust this one and that one, how am I to live, I should like to know? And if you can't pay now, I don't exactly see how you'll be able to\ raise twice as much when another week is up. I don't know about it, that's what I don't. I've lost agood deal trusting boarders; and when that scamp of a fellow, Dick Murphy, the journeyman hatter, went off in debt to me for a whole month's keep- ing, I made a vow that I'd never trust nobody agin-so help me, if I didn't. But somehow or other, when I look at them sweet little cherubs of yourn, I feel jist as though I'd be doing wrong to turn 'em out of house and home, because their mother hadn't any money. I was a mother once, but that's a long, long while ago, now. You ken stay-you shan't say I turned you out." Then Mrs. Peabody took the poor woman's babes up in her lap, and when she had looked into their innocent little faces, she kissed them and hugged them tightly to her bosom, and when she did this there were large tears in her eyes. 5     50      REALITY; OR, A In spite of Mrs Peabody's rough exterior, and ig- norant prejudices, she possessed a feeling heart. And instead of sending her unfortunate boarder forth to beg in the streets, or seek the Almshouse for food and shelter, she permitted her to remain. Her origin was unquestionably low, nor had her as- sociates been above the coarse and vulgar, still the mother found warmer sympathy at her hands, than she had met with before during all her sorrow. Moreover she expressed a willingness to assist her in procuring employment, which she firmly believed could be had anywhere by asking, and insisted upon conducting her forthwith to the dormitory of "Miss what-you-call-her," to learn where she got hers. They ascended to the "back attic," and there found the seamstress sought (whose name was Julia) in a room barely large enough to hold the three all at once. When they entered, Julia was seated under the only window in the apartment, and that opened out on the slate roof, revealing a cheerless array of chimneys and dingy back build- ings. Such a. visit rather surprised her at first, but the enquiries Mrs. Peabody began to make, soon brought about a clear understanding of each other's perplexities and wants. "I have plenty of work," said Julia-her last name she declined giving. "Yes, plenty. But the pay I receive is so small that I am obliged to   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     51 overtask myself to earn sufficient even to pay for my board. There!" she continued, holding up a vest that she had just finished, "there, I get only three and sixpence for making that. It takes me a whole day to make one, and then I must commence very early in the morning and use my fingers as nimbly as possible until late at night. At this rate you perceive I earn only about two dollars and a half a week. My board costs two and a quarter, not to mention washing, lights, and fuel. I am therefore compelled to work in- cessantly, and for the last six months or more, I have not laid by a single penny, and as to clothes, I've not had a new dress since last spring. You will excuse me though," she added, vigorously resuming her needle, "I must talk and sew at the same time, or I shall get behind." "Well, I never!" ejaculated Mrs. Peabody, open- ing her eyes with astonishment. "No; in all my life. Who'd a thought it? And then old what's- his-name, the tailor, only pays three and six for them ar westses. Pon my say-so I if it aint a down right shame-so it is. Three and sixpence for a - hard day's work.

But I must go look after the dinner--so I must for them ar good for nothing gals down in the kitchen will let the meat burn up, so they will--the lazy things." Mrs. Peabody thereupon hurried down stairs, leaving Julia and the afflicted mother to finish the interview themselves. But the prices given by other'clothiers were equally as paltry as Julia was then receiving, and it would, after all, be next to impossible for the poor widow to earn a living in that way for her- self and babes, when Julia, without any encum- brance, could scarcely make enough to pay her own board. And Julia declared they were all alike. She had been to a great number, but none were willing to pay, for the same kind of work, more than she was getting. "Indeed, they were,"   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     53 she said, 'quite indifferent whether their work was taken at all, for if one declined accepting their terms, a dozen others were glad to get even the meanest pittance to keep them from starving." She also expressed strong doubts of the poor wo- man being able to get work at any price, inas- much as she was comparatively inexperienced, and could not, above all, refer to a previous em. ployer. However, the generous girl offered to share hers, and that would save all further search. She could get as much work as she could finish, nor did it matter whose fingers ached in the performance of the tedious toil, so that the garments were safely returned and rightly done. Grateful for Julia's offer, she at once began; and in a very short time, notwithstanding the care of her children, it was evident that she could ac- complish the most work in the same number of hours. The first week her share of their earnings amounted to three dollars and a half, being fifty cents more than Julia's. Thus they labored on together for several months, during which the mother continued to receive by far the largest share of their earnings. Meanwhile Mrs. Peabody's affection for the children increased; and having paid in full for her board, the now hopeful mother felt as com- fortable as incessant and tedious toil would allow. But just when she thought her fortune was im- 5*     54:      REALITY OR, A proving, Julia received an anonymous letter, pur- porting to come from one whose interest in her welfare prompted him to warn her against the association of an unprincipled female, then work- ing with her. That female was described as hav- ing two children, the offspring of dishonor, and as she had no other acquaintance corresponding with the description, the poor widow must be the woman against whom the warning was meant. This anonymous missive brought a quick return of trouble. She denied the insinuations as apply- ing to her, but could offer no proofs to sustain the denial further than the events that had transpired since her discharge from the Hospital. The next day a second letter came, in another hand-writing, and pretending to be the friendly counsel of another individual who knew a great deal more than his modesty allowed him to state, to the discredit of the vile woman mentioned therein. Julia's credulity could not resist the effect in- tended by the designing author of these slan- derous letters, and she indignantly refused to remain in the society of the persecuted woman any longer. She did all in her power to convince Julia that she had ever been upright through prosperity and affliction; yet the credulous girl valued her own reputation too dearly to risk even the danger of   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     5 listening to the arguments of asserted innocence- and as a last resort, to avert a part of the calamity that seemed inevitable, the slandered mother im- plored her to at least recommend her to her em- ployer, that she might still obtain work. This favor she granted her; but what a disappointment it was to learn that the establishment she had been working for all this time, was none other than Delmaine's I She could not continue working for Delmaine, and once more she was obliged to solicit employ- ment of strangers. But she had experience now, and that made her more hopeful of meeting with success. Fortunately Mrs. Peabody did not credit the anonymous slander, and her friendship at least wasretained. Julia's niceregard for her reputation induced her to change her lodgings elsewhere, and so be sure to shun the contaminating presence of -suspected impurity. She had a wearisome search of several days, during which she met with all manner of repulses, and met with the most trying discouragement from heartless employers. Completely worn out from constant walking to and fro, without rest or stimulating words of com- fort, the wretched mother resolved to make another effort, and then--what then DESPAIRI It was dark in the evening and the lamplighter had already     56      R1EALITY; OR, A begun to go his rounds. The work-shops were pouring their operatives into the streets, and droves of men, women, boys, and girls, glad to gain release from the hard toil of the day, were hurrying home. There was a mighty current of humanity that seemed to surge and roll out from the heart of the great city; and as they brushed past her, the dejected mother stood aside to con- template the scene. Loads and loads of ills and tribulations went along; but there was at least a temporary gladness in the faces and in the carriage of those whose bosoms enclosed the secret miseries of their own experience. The jokes and the bois- terous laughter of the more buoyant fell upon her earandshe sighed: "Oh! 'tis hard-'tis very hard to stand here and see even the poorest laborer leave his toil with a light heart, and to think there is no joy for me. Why should I be thus alone and all this busy life around me? Why, oh! why can not I too enjoy a little earthly peace? I too will work-and oh, that I could find it to do i"As she thus soliloquised, her tongue gave audible utterance to words that reached the ear of a man with kindly face, who stood near ; he marked her well, and then approaching, said, "Looking for work, my good woman, I believe?"He smiled as he spoke, and the tone of his voice was so different from what she had been accustomed to hearing, that she almost stared at him a moment or so before ma-   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     57 king any reply, and when she did reply it was only an affirmative nod. "I thought as much," continued the man in the same tone. "And pray what kind of employment do you most desire? If you are a seamstress, perhaps I can give you something to do." These words came like sweet music to her rea- son, and suddenly joyful to hear even a probable realization of the object sought, she urgently begged him to employ her. "Follow me then," said he; and she was con- ducted to his place of business, when he promptly gave her a bundle of garments to make, and also expressed a few words of sympathy. With lighter spirits she returned to her lodgings, and endeavoring by increased energy to make up for the time she had lost, she succeeded in finishing her task much sooner than she expected. And when' she carried her work to the store, she was received by the proprietor with smiles of appro- bation. He was at that moment quite short of change, and could not pay her until she came again the following week. He seemed so sorry, that not- withstanding her want of the money, she said she would willingly wait. He declared it was too bad, and to encourage her said he would allow her in- creased pay for the next lot. Yes, he wanted her to understand that he not only felt for the needle- woman, but would seriously recommend that a     58      REALITY; OR, A higher scale of prices be acceded to by the trade. They were all paying but forty four cents each for fine vests; yet he was willing to give her fifty. He said much, and his manner was so clever that she began to congratulate herself upon having got into his employ. Another week's work was completed, and she hastened to her employer's store, with the full expectation of receiving pay for all she had done; and judge her disappointment when the clerk in- formed her that he was absent from the city, in consequence of which she would have to wait for her money until his return, which might be a couple of weeks hence. She stated her urgent necessities to the clerk, but he assured her that he could do nothing for her as the proprietor's in- structions were peremptory. She might have more work, and the clerk suggested that she had better take enough for the ensuing week, at the expiration of which it was more than probable the master would return, when she could have all in a lump. Under the circumstances, she was obliged to do as the clerk suggested, and went home again moneyless to toil another week. But Mrs. Peabody found no fault with her. Mrs. P. was a good-hearted body. She would trust her a month, she said, for which she thanked her most heartily. At the end of the third week, she carried in her   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     59 work and asked for the pay. But still the pro- prietor had not returned. However, he was ex- pected in a few days, and the clerk thought if she were to take enough work to last her two or three days more, and then come in again, she would certainly be disappointed no longer. To this she very reluctantly consented. Nor was she the only person thus waiting for their slender compensation. Quite a number lingered in the store, and their mutterings inti- mated pretty plainly that they would do no more until their pay was forthcoming. She heard sev- eral of them distinctly say that the proprietor was nothing better than a swindler, and had from the first intended to cheat them; but she kn'ew they were in a state of anger and excitement, and con- sequently thought they only imagined what they asserted. At any rate she would try once more. She finished and carried in the fourth week's work, when lo! a strange clerk was there, who told her that the establishment had changed hands. He said the former proprietor had sold out and gone to another city. While she stood talking with this new clerk, several other females entered whose grievances were similar to hers, and she learned from them that between sixty and seventy poor women, who had been working the past month, were cheated out of at least each three or four weeks' labor by the absconded employer.     60      REALITY; OR, A The greater part of them were nearly destitute, and the loss had fallen upon them most painfully. They desired the present proprietor to pay them, but although he was ready enough to re- ceive back their bundles of made garments, yet he disclaimed all knowledge of his predecessor's debts, and could not think of settling them. He would continue to give out work, but the most of them declined, preferring to run the risk of find- ing employment elsewhere. Thus the poor woman lost nearly six weeks' hard labor for which she never received a single cent. About this time, Mrs. Peabody took it into her head totnove to the country. She disposed of her furniture, and the boarding-house she had kept for many years was " to let." Now that her kind hearted hostess had gone away, the still unfortunate mother was lonely enough. Her pocket was entirely empty, and the future looked dark and gloomy. To seek employ- ment of the clothiers she thought would be of little use, inasmuch as her experience with them was so bitter. But what could a poor woman do? was a question she asked herself a thousand times a day. She could only do certain small things, the remu- neration for which amounted to barely enough to keep her soul and body together; a man would receive a dollar for doing that which if done by   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     61 a womafl only a few shillings would be paid; a man might get four dollars for making a coat, but. if a woman made another just like it, she must be content with a dollar and a half. And yet it requires just as much skill on the part of the woman, as it does on the part of the man. The woman takes quite as many stitches-perhaps a few more than the man. Her fingers are as weak as his, and as easily fatigued with labor. She is as liable to die of' consumption as he is. Her back and her breast can have as sharp pains and as much aching in them as his can feel. A woman may go blind as easily as a man. She wants food, clothes, and a place to lie at night, and if she is a widow with three or four, or perhaps half a dozen children to provide for, she needs as much to do all this with as though she were a man-aye, she needs even more. If a woman can live on fifty cents a day, a man can subsist on the-same amount. W"What can a poor woman do?" she asked her- self over and over again. "Is there nothing but a needle for me to earn my own support with? Nothing-not even employment for that?"So at least did she reason, notwithstanding there are many ways for a woman to provide for her wants with which the needle has no connection. But she did not understand all the arts of living. She could not entertain notions beyond the fixed custom of her personal experience. In her'op inion 6     62       REALITY; OR, A it was proper only for a woman to engage in such occupations as pertain to domestic seclusion. And, alas I if she had been ever so progressively inclined, the encumbrances of her widowhood and the poorness of her scanty apparel would have debarred her from reaping a suitable reward. She could have toiled indoors with faded garments and eyes blood-shot from .weeping, but to mingle with the world in a genteel and remunerative position, she must needs show a well-clad exterior and a smiling visage. Then where were the influences, the friends, or even the acquaintances whom she might claim the advice or assistance from, that would Be so necessary for her start and advancement in a profitable and respectable pursuit? Where, indeed? She was alone. In the midst of a great city where thousands roll in wealth, and where industry and thrift greet the eyes of strangers, she-groaned in solitude--a soli- tude not of seclusion, but a living death I Her senses benumbed to partial apathy, the sor- rowing mother wandered forth once more to en- quire for work. Store after store was visited, and mechanically she feebly walked farther on, until her foot struck a heavy purse that lay in the street. It contained nearly a hundred dollars, and she suddenly felt herself rich. The bright yellow gold made her eyes dance. She carried it to her lodging and poured it out on the table. The pieces   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     63 rang more musically to her ears than the notes of the prettiest gem in all the operas. Oh I it was delicious to touch the heavy coin and handle its magic weight. What comforts it would buy  What a burden of sorrow it could lift from an aching bosom, and what earthly happiness its po- tent power might bring!  But then it was not hers. This recollection quickly dispelled the visions of her elated mind. Perhaps some unfortunate man or woman might at that moment be weeping over its loss. It might be the all of some good honest family whose hard earnings had left only this little in store after years of toil. Who could tell the grief of its rightful owner? But it was a pleasure to gaze at the rich metal and count it over anti over. It was money, and its sight and touch alone made her something lighter of heart, although she dared not use it to meet her pressing wants. By the advice of a magistrate, she advertised it in two of the morning papers, and as no owner came he advised her to do with it as she pleased. Having thus the means, she bought a few articles of furniture, intending to board herself. In a short time, she was the occupant of a very snug apartment, in a genteel house, where she could live on somewhat less money than it cost her to board. Again she sought employment, which at last     "      REALITY; OR, A she found; but incessant toil by-and-by under- mined her health so that she could scarcely sew at all. She grew worse every day, and soon had to keep her bed. The landlord, finding her unable to pay the rent promptly for the room she had, notified her to leave. She was too ill to help her- self, but that mattered little to him-go she must. A woman who lived in the room next to hers, volunteered to find her a cheaper shelter. She disposed of some of her furniture, and with the balance, was moved on her bed to the miserable abode where, through the agency of her children, my friend and I found her some two months after- wards, lying sick and helpless, without food or fire to keep herself and children from perishing with hunger and cold. The poor invalid being much exhausted from relating her story of misfortune, here paused, and was soon lost in quiet slumber; whereupon I took my leave, intending to return the following day and learn how she had managed to live during the two months of her abode in the wretched hovel, where we found her by the guidance of her child- ren. But when the attending physician took me aside the next day, and whispered in my ears that the sick mother had been seized during the previ- ous night with the most alarming symptoms of approaching dissolution, it required an effort to   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     65 entertain any further hope of her recovery. The man of medicine did all his knowledge and experi- ence could suggest, yet the suffering invalid gradu. ally sank beneath the consuming virulence of a fatal disease. Death received her into its arms, and her earthly sorrow was aftan end. When Spring came and sweet flowers were blooming in the bright sunny world, the withered remains of the poor mother lay in the damp, cold grave mouldering in decay. Her short, though troubled span of life was run, and two helpless orphans remained to weep and wail with sobs and piercing cries, until their tender hearts seemed ready to burst under the cruel be- reavement of fate's decree. Who can know the deep grief that wrung the sweet chords offond affection thus snapped asunder in the breasts of these helpless babes? Alas! none but those whose early years were once made deso- late by a like misfortune, leaving them only the cold and heartless charities of a calculating and selfish world, that blunt all the sympathies and shed a gloom over earthly joys. Oh! pity the helpless child of want and sorrow, whom the ruthless hand of death deprives of father and mother, and leaves without the guidance of a friend, to struggle in sadness and alone through life's weary pilgrimage here below. Is there a living mortal blest with human feeling 6*     "      REALITY; -OR, A who can contemplate the sad spectacle of a friend- less, homeless, helpless child, whose melancholy countenance reveals the hopeless yearnings of a desolate heart, without offering at least a sigh in tribute to the memory of crushed affection? How often do we see in the streets the ragged offspring of penury, whose parents have gone to their last account, and with what concern have we marked their vulgar manners and coarse, unfeeling ways, that tell of vile associates and early know- ledge of sin! May not some of these juvenile out- casts have descendedfrom the best and fairest of our land, who from the adversities of fortune, could be- queath their children only the wide world, and the fruits of precarious chance? Yet who cares for these half clothed and worse fed orphans that scamper over the broad city in vagrancy, and eke out life as best they can? None. The only consideration they receive from their fellow creatures, is to watch them carefully and prevent their stealing, which, as a matter of course, their desperate exterior and skulking habits surely indicate in the minds of the community. And should one of them, to appease his hunger, take a four penny loaf of bread, a policeman stands ready to drag him hence, to serve from three to to six months in the House of Refuge or in the City Prison. Does the great philanthropist ever deplore the   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     67 condition of these orphans, who beg for broken victuals at the rear door of his "brown stone" palace? No; unless it be to condemn what he calls the " innate depravity of the poor," and recom- mend the penitentiary as the most fitting reservoir for all such precocious miscreants. 'Tis ever thus. Unless the object of charity is of sufficient impor- tance to create a noise, and immortalise the name of the donor, we too often see a paltry show of generous feeling on the part of those whose names figure most conspicuously in the popular mani- festations of the day. But thanks to the humane impulses of a certain good farmer, who consented to adopt the poor little orphans at my solicitation. The honest man had never been blessed with children of his own, and in the natural goodness of his warm, upright heart, he promised to do by them as a father, and devote the remainder of his days to their proper education. Happy in doing so much good, the generous man took them home with him to his fine farm in a neighboring state, where they also found the loving kindness of a mother in the wife of their adopted father. Like her husband, the charitable woman resolved to look upon the little orphans as though they were her own offspring. Nor was it long before the farmer and his wife had become deeply attached to their adopted heirs. Several years have elapsed since the death of     68      REALITY: OR, A their unhappy mother. Not long ago we went to visit them, and it pleased us much to find them not only reconciled to their lot, but seemingly very happy in their country home, where they now enjoy the fondest sympathy of their adopted par-. ents. In the course of time, it is reasonable to suppose that the good old farmer and his faithful wife will be gathered home to their fathers, and then, in accordance with a will duly executed, all that fine large farm, and much other property therewith, must be the inheritance of the poor needle woman's orphans. Now, reader, this narrative is not mere fiction -it is the sad history of a, broken-hearted woman, whose sorrows and afflictions carried her to the grave, Tore she had attained the'age of three and twenty. I shall never forget the two little beggars who hand-in-hand stood weeping in my path, that bit- ter cold day in December. And with what plea- sure I now and then call to mind their childish, joy, when, with their fill of food, and their tender bodies warm from the fire at the house of my friend, they fairly pulled us to the house where their sick mother lay! Oh! how their little hearts swelled in gladness when we moved them and that sick mother to a place of comfort! Yet when the spirit of their beloved parent fled, the scene was painful in the extreme. With what a fond   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     69 and sorrowful gaze did she press the little beings to her breast, until the cold hand of mortality transfixed those tear-swollen eyes in the ghastli- ness of eternal oblivion The sad spectacle haunts me still. Reader, did you ever follow the corpse of some dear departed friend to the receptacle of the dead? When the mournful train halted, and the silent spectators gathered close around, do you recollect that awful pause? Ohl how the bitter scalding tears gushed from your eyes and bathed your burning cheeks, as you stood there amid the throng taking a farewell look at that dismal coffin! And then when the solemn undertaker lowered that coffin slowly down into the deep, yawning grave, did not the hollow echo from the dull, heavy earth falling with awful clatter below, send a chill of horror through your desolate soul? Alasl 'tis a sad, a mournful thing to be thus forever separ- ated from those we love-to see those once bright and loving eyes closed in icy death, and then to feel that the departed is decaying in the dark, cold ground! Oh! there is an eternal fountain of melancholy regret ever after in fond memory's bosom. But no long train of costly equipages with rest- less steeds, and crape covered servants in livery, following a sable clad funeral car of rich ebony and gold, marked the burial of the poor mother.     70      REALITY; OR, A No! nor did the church bells toll a funeral knell. A single carriage containing the two little orphans, myself and a friend, and a plain hearse only, com- prised all the pageant that honored her exit from this world of sorrow. No imposing spectacle awed the multitude; and as we passed along the crowed streets perhaps there were none to inquire who might be going to the tomb. Nor was there a concourse around the grave. The undertaker, the grave digger, my friend and myself, were all who saw the last sad rites performed, and we alone heard the loud lamentations and mournful cries of the little orphans, while the corpse of their mo- ther descended to its dark and final abode. But dear reader, do not console yourself with the belief that I have exaggerated the story of this poor needle woman, nor imagine that she was a rare exception; for there are thousands and thou- sands of the daughters of toil in our 'large cities who groan beneath the most galling burdens, who drink deep of the cup of grief and are hopelessly enslaved in relentless destiny. Many of them are widows with small and helpless children, the for- mer wives and tender offspring of industrious and thriving husbands and fathers, who have descended to the last narrow habitation allotted to man, to possess the privilege of rest from labor, denied them while on earth. These widows, being deprived by providential   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     71 decree of the prop on which they were accustomed to lean for support, are thrown upon the world's wide common to drink full draughts of bitterness from its humanities, and to sip scantily of its pro- mised sweets. Bereft of the consolations of a care- ful and confiding companion-deprived of the aid of a living derived from a husband's hands, they are compelled, by the lurid glare of the eye of want in their dwellings, to labor hard for a subsistence for themselves and babes, to be buffeted by the adverse billows of life, to be exposed to the scorn of the proud and the neglect of the unfeeling. And when they enter on the thorny road of seeking a living by soliciting employment from those who feel no pity for their poverty, no sympathy with their sorrows, they begin to realize the loneliness and wretchedness of their condition, and to weep over the desolations that are thickening around them. Theirs is no common fate of poverty. Their own misfortunes and destitutions they could pa- tiently endure, but the wants of their tender, help- less offspring are scorpions in their hearts. The number of feeble ones, who look and piteously plead with them for bread, are indeed eloquent incentives to exertion, and all the faculties and powers they possess are subjected to the task of furnishing supplies for their wants. To provide for them as they ought, they are compelled to pro-     72       REALITY; OR, A cure for them a tenement in which to live, fuel to keep them warm, clothing to protect and cover their bodies, food to sustain their lives, medicines to preserve and restore their health, and education to instruct and qualify their minds for usefulness and knowledge. And almost the only instrument allowed her by long established custom, with which all these wants are to be met, is the needle. With this she sits herself down to work. The rising sun finds her at her task, and the midnight lamp expires ere her work is done. Day by day, and night by night, she continues to toil, and when Saturday evening arrives she conveys home the garments on which she has la- bored, and finds her incessant toil and arduous duty to herself and family requited by the pitiful pay- ment of two or three entire dollars. Enough, per- chance, to purchase bread for her hungry children, and more than enough to sicken hope and sadden her heart. Instead of the light, buoyant spirits that once cheered her onward to exertion, and scattered sunshine in the pathway of her future prospects, she feels the dense, dark clouds of adver- sity thickening and conglomerating around her. The frightful spectre of approaching want stalks terribly before her prophetic eye, the icy hand of despondency chills the vital current of her frame, the vulture of mental anguish tears her very heart- strings, and hope-that balsam to the bosom of the   HISTORY OF HUMANI LIFE.     73 wretched-is exiled from her breast, and superseded in its office by the convolving nigrescence of despair. With what spirit, with what heart, can she pursue her avocations, when all her toil and care and trouble barely produce her bread? With what feelings of exacerbated hope and expectancy can she think of the present and contemplate the coming curse of want? As she gazes with glaring eyes upon her young and tender offspring, and reads in their faces the fate that has befallen her, about to be inherited by them-as she witnesses their helplessness, and with sure prescience of the future reads the sibyl records of their destined want and misery, a thrill of horror freezes up the fountains of her heart-frenzy battens in her brain-destruction tears her with its talons, and I only wonder that the remainder of her history is not told in the incoherent ravings of the maniac, and her history written in the records of the mad house. 7     PART II. THE SEQUEL. I WROTE the preceding narrative more than a year ago, and afterwards published it in 'our Magazine, but since then I have learned many additional facts that make an interesting sequel to tell. The poor widow was long ago buried, and the little orphans have nearly grown into their " teens" under the affectionate guidance and protection of the good old farmer and his wife. Then surely my story would seem ended. The children are domiciled as far out of the reach of poverty as is possible for the strength of rich lands to place them. Nevertheless, I must add a few pages more, and thus I would write: On a wet, sloppy morning in January '58, there were many applicants at the office of the Literary Gazette, located in Broadway, New York, seeking employment as canvassers for that Magazine. We put an advertisement in one or two of the daily papers offering a liberal compensation to females (74)   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     75 of intelligence and good address, who could give satisfactory reference as to merit and trust. And what a motley gathering answered the call! ;Raw Irish girls newly arrived, or fresh from the kitchen; scrubs and washerwomen; chambermaids, factory girls, book folders, milliners, mantua makers and seamstresses of all kinds; young women, fat, strong and lusty, who said they had never done anything yet, that they had been living at home with their parents ever since they were born; feeble old women, who could only with difficulty hobble up stairs; female sharpers, and expert pickpockets of the same gender. But the majority of them were told to go, for with a few exceptions they were totally unfit to perform the duties required. Two or three of the coarsest and most illiterate were quite indignant though at not being accepted, evidently imagining themselves not only qualified for the business, but firmly believing their accomplish- ments and personal appearance on an equality with those of an educated lady. I happened to be in the office that morning myself, and the unusual crowd of applicants attracted my closest attention. With considerable difficulty the clerk in attendance got rid of the objectionable multitude, and then gave audience to a couple of very prepossessing young ladies who seemed particularly anxious to secure the situations sought. Of course they were freely questioned and thoroughly examined rela.     76      REALITY; OR, A tive to their qualifications and the occupations they had been engaged in before. "I have been teaching school," replied the elder. "My sister had a situation as governess in Four- teenth Street awhile, but the money panic or its consequences threw us both out of our situations." "Well," said the clerk, " we will consult your references, and you may call again to-morrow.- But you have forgotten to give me your own names." .The younger immediately wrote on a card, and laid it on the table, saying, "There, you'll find our names on that." I stood near by at the moment, and very natur- ally took up the card to see what she had written. It was a neat and pretty hand-"Misses Carze and Alice Delmanine." They were then in the doorway, and I hastened to call them back; for the name of Delmaine made me curious to learn if they were related to that wicked man whose persecutions brought so much trouble to the poor woman whom sorrov and want, years ago, consigned to a premature grave. A thought flashed across my mind and I .ques- tioned them. "Yes, ma'am, that is our name," one of th4n re- plied, not a little in wonderment at my inte'ioga- tions and the visible interest I had so suddenly taken. "But our parents are both dead. We are now in mourning, you perceive-it is for our dear   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.    " mother." It was Alice, the younger, who spoke, and she struggled to swallow the emotions that choked her in bitter remembrance of the fondly loved and gone. A tear moistened the eyes of both, and for a moment, reverence for their grief bade me silence. A careful glance of scrutiny revealed a hectic flush upon the cheek of Carrie, the elder, but the glow of blooming health tinged the countenance of her sister. "We were not always so poor," resumed Alice after a serious pause. "We were once surrounded with plenty." Carrie accorded to this with a heavy sigh, adding, "Yes, our father was a wealthy mer- chant, but from some cause which he never clearly explained to mother or to us, he lost his business and his money. A series of disasters overturned his mind, and our prospects gradually darkened until we now find ourselves in this wretched plight. "Be not disheartened," I urged, in a feeling tone, "you are young, and blest with an education. Your position is still enviable, when compared with that of thousands of our sex, who from the lack of elegant accomplishments, are inevitably doomed to pass their days in continual servitude. A prepossessing exterior and a cultivated mind, with the advantageous auxiliary of youth, are oftimes of more service than riches to a lady, in the reali- zation of her hopes and her ambition. You must 7*     78      REALITY; OR, A not despond. The world is before you, and with cheerful spirits and courageous hearts, you cannot fail to find at least a moderate share of earthly joys." "But the friends we formerly had, seem to have deserted us entirely"-interposed Alice--and now when we are most in want of their advice or as- sistance, they chill us with their cold looks and listless responses." "Thus it generally is. The friends of the rich are proverbial for vanishing when the clouds of adversity darken the horizon." In this wise I endeavored to cheer their really drooping spirits. I was fully convinced from the answers they made to many questions touching that point, that the daughters of Delmaine the ex- tensive clothier, whom the reader is somewhat acquainted with, were before me. During the lapse of years-from the burial of the poor wo- man to the time of which I now write-I had frequently seen that name in the newspapers and once or twice heard it spoken; but until reading the card written by Alice, I thought or cared very little about it. But now my curiosity was greatly excited, and I resolved to continue my inquiries of the persons whom they gave as references. In- deed I began to entertain a strong liking for the daughters. They were very pretty, intelligent, and agreeable: and no matter what the faults or the   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     79 iniquity of their father might have been, they could not help what he had done. I bade them be of good spirits, and they left, promising to return the next day. Their references were attended to immediately; for I was exceedingly anxious to find out the par- ticulars of their father's downfall, and which I suspected, was better known to their acquaintances than to themselves. Nor was I disappointed. The first one I called upon--aa very nice old gentleman, living retired, and in elegant style- gave me all the information I wanted. I soon found he was a bachelor--and particularly enter- taining. He talked in this wise: "The Misses Delmaine, eh? Oh! yes, I knew their mother before them. They are very clever girls, but not at all equal to what shle was at their age. Good girls, I dare say--their mother was a most remarkably handsome person. She was a great belle in her young days, and I really thought quite seriously of marrying her myself but--but you see I could not exactly make up my mind to it, and so I let Delmaine take her. It was a bad day's work for her though, and I dare say she often repented it. She would have been much happier if I had married her--I have no doubt of that. Yes, you see, Delmaine was a gay fellow-- very fond of company, and not overly conscien- tious about the many little capers he used to cut.     80       REALITY; OR, A I knew him from the time he first came to New York until his death. He said he was a Scotch. man, but I never believed it--there was more Welch than Scotch in him. He was constantly forming partnerships in his business, and, as he thus frequently changed around, generally man- aged to get the best of each bargain. Once he raised his book-keeper to partnership--a very exemplary young man, newly married to one of the sweetest angels I ever saw. This he did be- cause he was enamored with the young wife, and at once bethought himself of a singular and fatal plan to get the husband out of the way. Having elevated the book-keeper, he encouraged him to excesses of dissipation until he was soon a;hopeless inebriate, and then expelled him from the firm. Soon after he died--but not before his destroyer was entrapped by one Bagshaw, a lawyer sent by a strange woman to thwart him. This lawyer suc- ceeded in releasing both the husband and his wife from prison, where they had been confined in' order to frighten the latter into compliance. What became of her afterwards I could not dis- cern, although I diligently sought her whereabouts. They did say that she actually starved to death. Occasionally I heard where she had been, but never arrived at any lodging she occupied until after she was gone. I never saw her more than once or twice, and that was directly after she Io   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     81 was married, but I well remember her sweet, inno- cent face. Bless her pretty picture I I would have been happy indeed to have bettered her wretched condition." Here I interrupted Mr. Dartwell, my informant, by turning narrator myself, and telling him the par- ticulars of my experience with her last moments --for as the reader perceives, the book-keeper's wife and the poor mother whose history I have already given, were both one and the same. He might not be pleased if I were to mention his real name, and for present convenience I will call him Dartwell. "Then she did not starve, after all?" said Dartwell, demurely. And when hehad thought a moment or two of the past, he broke the silence  and continued: "Well, well I we can not help what is done." He thereupon bade a servant bring some wine, and begged to offer me a glass, declaring it was the best ever imported. The weather was raw--my feet were quite damp--and I willingly accepted. Better wine I never tasted. Nevertheless I am no " wine-bibber"-a very small demijohn would hold as much as I have drank in all my life. Indeed I am strongly opposed to the common use of such drinks. And yet there are occasions when a glass of p ur e is of great benefit. But in too many cases the medicine even- tually does more mischief than the ailment for which it is taken.     82      REALITY; OR, A For extreme debility, while recovering from long and severe illness, and in old age when the physique becomes weak and exhausted, a moderate and judicious use of such stimulants must certainly be beneficial--and exactly in proportion as they are beneficial then, they are deleterious to growing youth andperfect health I I ask the reader's pardon for this digression, but when I daily see young people runing to the brandy bottle or the wine decanter every time they have the head ache, a sore tooth, or a cramp, expecting or pretending there is such a miraculous relief in a dram, I can not refrain from alluding to it now and then. Why, I know mothers who recommend brandy to their children in almost every case of in- disposition - whether from biliousness, a bad cold, or a stomach overstocked with cucumbers or green apples. If the child burns its finger, brandy must cure it; if it tumbles down stairs, use brandy outside and in. Mr Dartwell drank copiously, and then resumed. It was a very unpleasant reflection. Nevertheless, while he sought her, she was almost daily passing his costly abode. Oh! that she had known such a friend lived there in that elegant mansion. Many a time she looked up at the richly capari- soned windows, the elaborate decorations of the brown stone walls, and the great broad steps that ascended to the high and stately portal. Many a,   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     83 sigh she breathed as she compared that lordly pa- lace with her own wretchedness and want-little dreaming that its owner would have freely thrown open those polished rosewood doors for her wel- come reception. Alas! that she should have suf- fered such terrible privation, when a rich and no- ble hearted man longed to appropriate a little of his vast income to make her comfortable and happy. Verily, the realities of city life, and its. inexplicable mysteries, include all manner of ex- tremes. Delmaine's troubles began to thicken after Bag- shaw entrapped him. The poor woman died be- fore he could be tried for the perjury, and he got clear of that. But several forgeries that con- sumed the entire joint capital of his partners caused the firm of Delmaine & Co. to suspend. At that time, "suspensions" were not so common as they fave been of late, and their failure made quite a stir. An investigation was had, but what hand did the mischief, or what pocket got the money, could not be discovered. Subsequently a young man died in Australia who disclosed to his nurse just previous to his last, that a merchant in New York had hired him to do a very similar crime, and then to leave for that remote region. Delmaine's partners tried to use this confession against him, but although it convinced them, a court of justice insisted upon stronger proofs.     84      REALITY; OR, A They lost all they had, and he seemed richer than ever. His conduct grew more unguarded after awhile. He imbibed a great fondness for gamb- ling, which, together with excessive drinking, made him very dissipated and reckless. Two or three years of such a career changed his circum- stances very much, and he really began to find a difficulty in raising money to meet his extrava- gances. At length, when he was driven quite desperate, he effected large insurances on the re- maining property he held, which, although heavi- ly mortgaged, was. of considerable value. His creditors grew tired of promises and waiting, and he was encompassed upon all sides with bodings of trouble. There was a conflagration one night, and the morning papers gave a lengthy account of how Delmaine's handsome residence was totally consumed by fire---evidently the work of an in- cendiary. The account also stated that Delmaine and his family barely escaped alive-with nothing but their night clothes. By and by Delmaine wanted the insurance money. To this the insurers objected-they wanted time for a closer investiga- tion. One of his old partners volunteered to as- sist in tracing up the origin of the fire, and Del- maine foresaw danger from the developments then being gradually made. Suddenly he told his wife he was going to Europe, and she got herself and daughters ready for starting. He quietly settled   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.    85 up his affairs--all but the insurance--and engaged their passages on board the next steamer.+ The day and the hour when the ship was advertised to sail had come, and they all went on board. A few moments more, and the steamer would begin her ocean voyage. Already the moorings were being unfastened, and the hurry and excitement of departure fearfully increased. The last warn. ing signal was given for the separation of the passengers and their friends. The captain stood high up on the wheel house, and shouted through his trumpet, "All ashore." The brawny arms of the sailors pulled at the tackling that hoisted the gangway on board, and in a few seconds the only remaining connection with the land would be re- moved. The ponderous wheels began to turn and dash about in the deep water. The appalling roar of surplus steam almost deafened the ear. But Delmaine and his wife and daughters did not stand with the throng on the upper deck to con- template the exciting confusion, for he seemed gloomy and ill at ease, and they remained seclud- ed below. The pilot had put his hand on the bell pull to ring for the engineer to put the pon- derous machinery in full motion, and Delmaine ventured on deck alone to take a parting glance, when two strong men rushed upon him and forci- bly dragged him ashore. There was no time for explanations, entreaties, or prayers, and the steam- 8     86      REALITY; OR, A er dashed swiftly away. Half an hour afterwards, the great dark hull of the vessel had disappeared from the bay, and was out on the deep ocean. And little dreaming that her husband was left be- hind and already bolted and barred in prison, Mrs. Delmaine wondered why he kept so long out of her sight. However, before retiring for the night, she learned of some of the passengers that he had been seized and thrust ashore. Thus she and her daughters were compelled to cross the ocean alone, and endure a long, long suspense and torture of mind as to why he was so ruthlessly torn from them. And Delmaine, too,--his wife and children were on the mighty deep, and he forced to lie there in prison--the same prison where he caused the poor book-keeper to groan years before. What must have been the feelings of the wretched man? He had applied the match of conflagration to his own house-he was an ac- cused felon. The evidences were conclusive. In addition thereto, other charges were threatening. A few more pages and I mut stop. The reader will therefore pardon me for condensing the finale into the small space left, instead of spinning it out, as I would much rather do, into a long and thrilling story. But I must be brief. The late intemperance of Delmaine had shattered his mind, so that when he was plunged into the awful vor- tex his crimes made him, his intellect seemed   HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE.     87 ready to be dethroned. His trial came speedily on, and before he met his wife and children again, he was not only convicted and sentenced to the state prison, but was a raving maniac. They returned; but when they saw him he knew them not. Soon after he died. After his debts were paid, the little left of his estate sufficed to keep his family awhile from want. A few months went by, and his wife was laid beside him in Greenwood Cemetery. Their graves are near the spot where the skeletons of the poor needlewoman and her husband lie. Peace! Peace, to the dust of them all 1 Seeing that Mr. Dartwell was rich, and having plenty to spare, I urged him to look after Alice and Carrie, which he readily agreed to do. Poor Alice It was as I surmised. She had the germs of a consumptive disease already fixed in her system, for she took a heavy cold from expo- sure in the wet streets and raw weather when she came to the office of the "Gazette." So Carrie came the next day alone. We would have gladly given these young ladies the employment they sought, but Mr. Dartwell acted upon my suggestion, and after a little deliberation, concluded to offer them both a home in his elegant mansion. But whether they will be happy there, is somewhat questionable to me; for Miss Emily (an elderly maiden sister of DartwelD is not one of those extremely amia-     88 REALITY; OR, A HISTORY OF HUMAN LIFE. ble creatures who delight in benevolence. Mr. Dartwell will excuse me, I hope-but really there is so vast a difference between him and his venera- ble sister in this particular virtue, that I feel at liberty. to mention the fact to my readers. I have no intention to offend Miss Emily, for really I think she is a very worthy lady. But she has been the presiding mistress of her beloved brother's household so many years, that it is quite natural she should feel jealous of all female encroachments upon the precincts of her dominion, and to be suspicious of pretty young ladies in general. Mr. Dartwell does seem to take a particular in- terest in one of his charming proteges. Strange things do happen now-a-days. Mr. Dartwell has been a bachelor a long time, and of late he occa- sionally offers a comparison or two quite favora- ble to matrimony.   THE APOSTATE QUAKER!! OR, ABOLITIONISM   EXPOSED.

He hath a tear for pity, and a hand Open as day for melting charity. Shakspeare. See how he sets his countenance for deceit, And promises a lie before he speaks. Dryden. THE authoress of "Reality, or a History of Hu- man Life," has just written a book of intensely exciting interest, founded upon remarkable facts (89)     90     THE APOSTATE QUAKER; pertaining to the strange inconsistencies of Abolition- ism, and bigoted zeal, showing the private lives, in vivid contrast with the public preachings, of many of the sympathisers of the North with the slaves of the South. It is nAot her purpose to advocate Slavery, but rather her intention to elucidate the moral principles of these self styled philanthropists, as proven by their common habits in every-day existence. She will reveal some strange things! Years of intimacy with the Quakers, and other "agitators" inhabitingthe Middle and Eastern States, have familiarized her with the domestic practices of those who so pathetically pray and weep in religious meetings and other assem- blages, with such deep and pure commiseration for the bonded African, while their own dependants-- "taken children," apprentices, and servants-some- times almost "their own flesh and blood," aretreated with worse brutality than a slave dealer would pre- sume to inflict upon a rebellious negro. For there are racks and pains of torture far morefrightful than " buying and selling." She will show how professed christians can, and DO wither the hearts of the poor widow, and crush the affections of the hapless orphan. She, will show by irrefragable facts, how the iron hearted negro worshipers charit- ably take poor little children to raise, whom they work, scourge, buffet, kick, scold, and half-starve from infancy to a premature grave, or to maturity   OR, ABOLITIONISM EXPOSED.   91 with distorted limbs, dwarfish bodies and no edu- cation. She will show how the fanatics who weep for the emancipation of the negro, take white children and force them to the hardest servitude, never allowing them, during the lapse of ten or fifteen years, a single hour for their own free pleasure and recreation-to play and be happy-- until a certain age gives them lawful freedom. She will also show a hundred other contrasts be- tween the white slaves of the North, and the black slaves of the South. Although born and educated in the North, the Authoress has traveled and lived in the South quite long enough to per- fectly acquaint herself with Southern people and Southern institutions. From infancy up, she was taught to hate everybody living south of "Mason and Dixon's line," and to abominate everything per- taining to slavery; and thus she was taught by the very fanatics whose mock philanthropy she now intends to expose. But the hot-bed preju- dices planted in the pliant mind of her infancy have been removed by actual observation and per- sonal experience-she has seen for herself, with her own eyes, in the broad daylight of truth-and learned from living proofs, that, after all, the hardest task masters are the moral lunatics who cry and moan the loudest for negro freedom. Yet the upright and well meaning opponents of Southern Slavery need have no fear of her pen. * r     92     THE APOSTATE QUAKER ; She has no desire to meddle with the religious faith or the conscientious belief of any one. She neither advocates Slavery nor wars against it. She has merely resolved to produce at least one book of " truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," that may weaken the prejudicial influ- ence disseminated by the great stack of rabid vol- umes already published to calumniate the South. She will not use " imaginary characters" to establish the authenticity of her exposures-she will intro- duce. living personages, publicly known--notori- ous agitators, whose preachings have disturbed the Union. Such men and such women as these shall be stripped of their " cloaks of charity" and their " garbs of sanctity," and with their hypocrisies unveiled, they must ever after remain objects of odium; for all good, honest people will turn from them with bitter scorn.
