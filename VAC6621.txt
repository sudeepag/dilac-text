In the middle of Jie afternoon of a fine, sunny day in the early part of April, in the year of grace one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, a young man dressed in the rough garb of a hunter, with a rifle thrown care- lessly over his right shoulder, might have been seen making his way, with a calm, thoughtful air, through a thick wood which rose gradually till it reach- ed the top of a high hill that overlooked the surrounding country, and whose brow jutted over the winding waters of South Carolina's noblest river-the Santee. The pensive air of the young hunter, whose age could not have been more than four or five and twenty, precluded the idea that he was in quest of game, for, Phe feathered inhabitants of the wood, as if conscious of se- curity, piped on their songs of gladness, and the various denizens of the under- brush darted at intervals across his path, without in any degree disturbing his thoughts or attracting his attention. The appearance of the young man was at once striking and picturesque. His figure was somewhat above the ordinary height, and, although inclining rather to slenderness than otherwise, straight as an arrow, and of a most per- fect and commanding symmetry. He was habited in a cap of dark cloth, a loose deer skin frock reaching midway between the thigh and knee, buck- skin leggins fringed with red and blue stuff, and russet colored boots whose high, broad, open tops hung carelessly around his knees. From a belt slung around his waist, depended a small buff pouch, together with a long, double- edged blade, whose top was surmounted by a stout elk-horn handle. His peakless cap gave a bold and saucy air to his otherwise manly and impressive featurea His brow slightly tinted with the bronze peculiar to the denizens of the sunny South, was high and massive, and possessed an air of calm re- flectiveness not common to men of his years. His eyes were large and of a' bright, clear gray, their irises glittering like belts of light around two pupils of liquidious blue; his nose was straight, the nostrils small but boldly defined, and impressing a beholder with the idea of deep passions in repose; his lips, moderately small, Were chiselled like a bow; his chin was slightly promi- nent, and garnished with a small, sharp-pointed beard; his long, handsomely shaped neck was slender, but firm and muscular, and, ever exposed to the sun and air, bronzed like his cheeks and brow. One could not look at his countenance withllot becoming impressed with the conviction that the hunter was a young man of an unusual mental cali- bre; intelligence, coolness, strength and self-reliance shone in every feature, and stamped him as one not likely to be daunted by ordinary perils, nor turned from his purpose by any common cvent. But the most striking char- acteristic of his features war, that air of calm reflectiveness to which we have     4.        TtilE S   TWAMP STEED; OF THE PAYS  already alluded, and which gave to his countenance a majesty, nobltnes  and strength, that stamped him of a superior order in the ranks of men. The young man pursued his way thoughtfully through the wood; and, so apparently earnest were his meditations, without once lifting his eyes from the ground, guiding his steps through the devious trees and unbroken brush- wood with that calm, unerring accuracy which appears so much like instinct, nnd yet is the strongest and most indubitable evidence of the keen and ex- perienced woodsman, On reachrig the top of the hill, the hunter turned to the left and continu- td his way, by a narrow and somewhat trodden path, till he came to a large open clearing, some nine or ten acres in extent, in one corner of which rose a cabin built of green, unhewn logs, and thrown together in that primitive manner which was the distinguishing feature of the early settlements of our country when the necessity of some kind of shelter took precedence of its oppea'rance. The clearing was cut up into small patches for the raising of corn, potatoes and other vegetables, which now began to present a thrifty and handsome appearance, and to promise largely to the husbandman for his trust in the providence of mother earth. The hunter paused . few moments on reaching' the edge of the clearing, flurg a calm yet rapid glance, over the promising field, during which his quick eye took in a thorough survey of the condition of the various patches, and then, striking into a side path which skirted the clearing, resumed his slow, measured step till he came to a beaten track leading to the cabin. As he approached, there emerged from the log house, as if to meet him, a tall, lusty, manly personage, whose figure was encased in the wild and singu- lar costume of the backwoodsmen of that era. His gigantic frame reminded one of the stalwart giants of the early ages, and seemed as if made by nia- ture to penetrate the mysterious depths of the wilderness, rid it of all the obstacles and dangers which stand in the way of the settler, and thus pio- neer the advance guard of civilization to comfort, security and strength. He wore a long, loose, green hunting shirt, which was fastened at the waist by a deep, stout black girdle, in which hung a long, sharp pointed knife, whose highly tempered blade glittered in the sunlight like a flashing mirror; at his side, suspended by a belt slung over his right shoulder, depended a large powder horn, and directly underneath it, an ample pouch of deer skin, tolera- bly well lined with bullets,* wads and scraps of linen to serve as bandages in case of need; his limbs were attired in doe-skin leggins fringed at the sides and extremities with scarlet yarn; his large, wide feet were covered with buff moccasins, whose tops presented a showy array of white, green, blue, and red bead work, of which their owner, judging by their clean, and almost spotless condition, and the care he evinced in preserving them from discolor- ment, was not a little proud. He wore a coarse, gray felt hat, of a sugar loaf shape rising above a deep and slouching rim. Beneath his broad, high and sun- tanned brow gleamed two large dare-devil eyes of a deep brown hue, which sparkled with a mingled expression of cunning, intrepidity and good nature. A large, Roman nose, a mouth of moderate dimensions, small, thick lips. and a protruding chin, finished a face whose boldly marked outlines were em- blematic of the shrewd, fearless and happy tempered disposition of their owner. "Bless my old aunt Sally!" exclaimed the woodsman, as the young hunter advanced and stretched out his hand, " if it aint Neil Somers! Why Neil!" he. continued, wringing in his broad palm the proffered hand of the young hunter, "what on airth brings yew to the log house of Nat Akarman * is it red skin? The varmint hev been seed, they say, on the borders, on the look out for scalps. Hev yew heerd on 'em?" The young man slowly and smilingly shook his head.   OF MARION ANiD atl[; s'EL AEV\ MiN;N.  "     an you sare me half an hour, Nat?" said he bending his thoughtful eyes meaningly on the woodsman. "Sartain!' answered the latter good humnoredly, ' half a year if yew likel  Wait a moment till I get old Sal; I make it a pint never to take a step with- out her. She's the only rale ginooine critter to be found in these parts. Old Sal will drop a red skin at three hundred yards quicker 'n (baim lightlin  Jest hold on a minit, till I gt her, and then we'll go down to the old tree on the ledge." So saying, the woodsman turned and entered the log house, from which he presently emerged, with a long rifle thrown over his shoulder, the stock of which he grasped in his large brawny hand with an expression of tenderness that was all but ludicrous. "[Here she is, Neil!" he cried in a tone of enthusiasm, as he took the weapon from his shoulder and held it up to the gaze of his visitor. "Isn't she a beauty?"                    t "I am well acquainted with her merits, Nat," ansswered the young hunter. "Have I not heard her bark among the hills of the Cherokees; did not see her flash at the battle of Etchoee, where her gray teeth made many a red skin bite the dust without giving him time to sing his death song'?" "Ha! ha! ha!" cried the wodsnman, his eyes sparkling with pride, 'she did make the red devils play at leap frog a etleee on that day, didn't she? But, come-let's tramp over to the old tree on the ledge!" So saying, he turned off to the left, aid quitting' the clearing, struck into a small wood, and passed on in silence somre two hundred yards, when they came to a large open, sterile spot, in the shape of a crescent, on the edge of the mountain, from which they could look forth on the sur-rounding country. with its small sparse villages, and scattered plantations, and beneath whiel ran the crystal waters of the lovely and majestic Saltee. In the centre of this snall sterile patch; its long straight limbs leaning over the rocky ledge, rose a huge cypress, whose leafy branches, stretching wide around, shielded them from the sun, and invited themn to partake of the quiet and coolness of its shade. "Here let us rest-here let us converse," observed the young hunter seat- ing himself at the base of the tree, and laying his rifle carefully across his knees. "Yes," said the woodsman, imitating his companion. "This old tree is a nice place for a talk. There aint another spot like it in the province. I alters cum here when my 'fairs want thinkin' on, and when I'm meditatin' on a tramp after red skins. Here I fix my traps, regillate the edges ofn my knifb, grease up and fix the jints of old Sal there," nodding at his rifle, "when she wants doctorin', and see that every thing is chuck up afore I start fbr the trail. It is a nice old tree! But. Neil, :mr boy, where on airth hev yew kep' yourself? * I've been down to your plantation in Kingstree, hrore'n a dozen times within the last three months, atn the niggers told me that cIem w were not to huml ; they didn't seemn to know where yev'd g'one, but they 'peared to be pretty sartain you were not around." "They were not uncivil. Nat,?" de:manded the young' planter, rai:ing hii thoughtful eyes and fixing them s:olomchat strongly on the woodsman. "Oh, Jerusha! no," answered Nat Akarman, with a good humored smile, "nuthin of the kind. Your niggers are the civilest woolly headtl in the hull province. They were as perlite and good natured a; au old raid when tho receives a proposal! But where Qon airth'hev you been, and when did yew git hum?" "I've been down to Chirleton,' anirs rceed the p!ulter, "and I got home yesterday." "Down to Charleston--makin' puarcha ej, p'raps? s. .t the waodsmau. The planter smiled, and answered:     6        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "Yes, that ameng other things." "Dew tell! and how are all the folks comnin' on down there?" "From bad to worse!" answered the planter, with an air of melancholy. "The breach between the people and and the crown widens more and more every day. It is nothing but taxes-taxes-taxes, and the people murmur." "The old story!" observed tie woodsman impatiently. "But the people are in earnest now!" said the planter calmly. "And, be- tween ourselves, they are concerting how to throw off the yoke tha now oppresses them; and depend upon it, my friend, they will bring matters around to please themselves. They feel that they have too long submitted to the unjust encroachments of the crown!" "And do you believe, Neil, there is grit enough in 'em to shake their fists under the nose of old King George?"  "Yes," answered the planter, unhesitatingly; "I believe they are in earn- est now. Listen, while I prove it. But first tell me have you been down among the settlements of late?" "No," replied the woodsman; "I make it a pint not to 'sociate with people any more'n I kin help, I aint to hum much to do it, ef I had the inclination. I've got some small bills remainin' on hand to settle with them blasted yaller bellies; they haven't paid up the scalps they owe me: and old Sal here won't rest quiet till she's given 'em a receipt in full." "I understand you," said the young planter. "You've told me the'story. 'Tis twenty years since the red skins surprised your home at midnight, while your family were reposing in the arms of sleep-wantonly set it on fire, and shot your father, mother, brother, sister and wife, as they tried to escape from the flames!" "Yes," answered the woodsman, in a voice slightly broken with emotion, whild from his face every particle of blood slowly receded, leaving his swar- thy features livid as those of a corse, "'tis twenty years since the varmint fired the old house, which stood where my own log hut stands now; 'tis twenty years since I swore to pay them back with interest for that night of blood; and the scalps in my log cabin will bear me witness that I hev kept my oath!" "And you have never wearied of your work of vengeance?" "Never!" answered the woodsman with a swarthy smile. "It has be come a second natur' with me. I could not live ef I had to give it up. A red skin cannot come in sight of me or old Sal without smellin' powder and lusin' his scalp; and when they aint in sight, I make it a pint to go and hunt 'em up. I had a glorious time of it when they used to come down upon the frontier, and the settlers, under Frank Marion, went out to drive 'em off and and make 'em taste lead; -then old Sal and I fairly rioted in scalps, from which carcumstance every body called me 'Nat, the Scalp Hunter.' When the varmint ceased to provoke the settlers to start out and punish 'em, and there was no more legitimate work for old Sal, I found it necessary for her peace and comfort, to carry on the war against 'em alone, and I've done'it I Sal turns up her nose at painters, wolves, and such common varmint, and wunt tetch nuthin' but the genooine meat-red skinI This gives her and me plenty to do, for the Cherokees and Catawhas kin be found ef yew look 'em up. I know their trail, and it keeps me busy to attend to 'em. This is the reason, Neil, why I don't go down much among the settlements, and why I know so little of what is goin' on among the people. But yew say the boys down there in Charleston, have got the rale stuff in 'em, and that they wun't put up with the yoke any longer?" Yes," answered the planter. "Well!" observed the woodsman, " all that sounds to me like an old story. Ever since I came to old Son' Carliny, I've heerd nuthin' but grumblin' agin the King and his oudacious taxes; the people dekleered they wouldn't stand. (I   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MiN,           7 it then-that was a good many years ago, when this tax business wasn't nuthin' to what it has been since, let alone to what it is now-and yet they stood it then, have stood it ever since, and air just as likely to stand it now. I don't like grumblers, who growl at everything and don't do nuthin'." But they are in earnest now, Nat!" observed the planter, in his deep, impressive voice. '   "So they've been sayin' a good while," returned the scalp hunter, with a smile of incredulity. "They've been talkin' about their arnestness, like all the other colonists, ever since I was knee high; and while they've been talkin' the monster has grown big enough to strangle 'em. Why in the name of human natur' don't the critters do somethin'?" "!'They have, at last!" said the planter. "Got up a petition, or an indignation meetin', I s'pose," observed the soalp hunter, with a slight sneer. "No," returned the planter, calmly. "Better than that" " "They hev gone in a body to the Governor and told him they had no more money to pay, and he'd have to get the taxes by selling their prop- erty?" , "No; better than that." "They have clubbed together, got the collector into their midst by a strata- gem, and putting a pistol to his head threatened to blow out his brains ef he didn't sign their receipts in full, and swear he had lost the money?" con- tinued the scalp hunter, in the same sneering tone. "Better than that l" "They hev gone in a body to the Governor and told him if he wouldn't pick up his traps and quit the province, they would 1" "Better than that!" "Neil," said the scalp hunter, dropping his vein of irony, and addressing the planter in a tone of unusual tenderness mingled with reproach, "I begin to think yew are fooling me in this matter, or else air yourself deceived. It is unpossible, it 'pears to me, for yew to go agin your character and turn jester even on a pint like this; and equally as unpossible, 'cording to my idees, for these critters, who hev endured their heavy yoke so long, to have grit enough left to rise up agin it now 1" "I am not one to trifle with the credulity of any man or men, let alone my friends," answered Neil Somers, in his usual calm voice; " nor do I think I am deceived in the matter of which we have been speaking. I have heard with my own ears, I have seen with my own eyes, Nat; and it is from what I have heard and what I have seen that I have come to the conclusion the people are in earnest, iow!" "Tell me, Neil, what it is you hev heerd," said the scalp hunter, drawing closer to his companion, and preparing every sense to catch each expression of voice, feature and movement of the planter. "I have heard the people," said Neil Somers, in his calm, impressive voice, "instruct their representatives, publicly, to take some ,neasures to warn the crown of their determination to put up no longer with it oppres- sive exactions, and of their unalterable resolution to unite with the inhabitants of the other colonies in resisting its insolent and arbitrary encroachments on their rights as citizens, and on their feelings as men." "Yes," said the scalp hunter, ' that now is some'n like I Go on 1" "I have heard their representatives, that is to say, the provincial congress, declaim aloud, in honorable and justly indignant terms, against the baseness of the crown in conceiving its atrocities and against the baser souls of its minions, who sought to carry those atrocities into execution by inflicting them upon the people." Good ain 1" exclaimed the scalp hunter, with a slight smile of irony, "And that was the end of their patriotism?"     8        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "No r' answered Neil Somers, bending his calm eyes som'ewhat reproach- fully upon his companion. "You have not heard enough to form a judg- ment; you have heard what I have heard, but you have not yet heard what I have seen /" "True. Well, to justify your idee that the people are in arnest upon these matters, what hev yew seen?" "I have seen them," resumed Neil Somers, calmly, "pledge themselves by word and signature, to refuse to use, and to prevent the importation of, goods arid merchandise from the mother country; and in keeping with this pledge, I have seen them go at midnight, masked and disguised, on board the shipping in Cooper Bay, and, like their brethren of Boston, take the tea, and other merchandise and tumble it into the river. I have seen them in the still dark hours of night, break open the public armory, abstract its muskets, cutlasses, cartouches, flints, matches and other materials of war. I have seen them forcibly enter the public powder magazines, seize all the ammunition, and convey it away to a secret spot known only to themselves, so as to have it ready in the hour of need. I have seen and heard the provincial congress of our province respond with heart and hand to the recommendation of the continental congress to oppose, by every means in their power, every mea*- ure of the home government bearing upon the colonies, and to destroy every vestige of trade between them, until the crown shall relieve them of their present sufferings and redress the outrages it has committed upon them in the past!" "Al this is good, all this looks well, all this shows like the rale grit 1" ob- served Nat, after a brief pause. "And it will lead to sum'n serious for the colonists," he added thoughtfully; "for King George is vain, and will'not quietly put up with such an insult to his pride, he is rich and sassy, too, and rich and sassy men wunt 'low enny body to be sassy but themselves; and he is strong also, with soldiers and men-of-war enough to blow the colonies to powder by the cord. Yes, Neil-it'll be a serious matter 1" "' There can be no doubt of that, Nat. But however serious it may prove, they will find a friend in you-will they not?" said Neil Somers, bending his eyes with a nervous, yet confident glance on the scalp hunter. "Why, as to that Neil," returned the latter, " there kin be but one 'pin- ion. My natur don t jibe with Kings nor red skins for they both prey upon the people. The citizens in Charleston could git along bravely, ef it wus'nt for the King, who taxes 'em to death; and the yeomanry in the settlements could swim along handsomely if it warn't for the yaller bellies. Take away both these varmint, and this province would be one of the happiest and most prosperous in all creation." "You reason well, Nat!" ' The crown is strong, Neil, and so air the yaller bellies; but I have fout them varmint for hard on to twenty years, and though I've dropped a good menny on 'em in that time, they haven't succeeded as yet in spilling me, and I kalkilate on sweatin' a few more on 'em afore I lay by for good. And so I j hold the 'pinion that the provinces, kin give old King George a small sprink- lin' of powder and lead in exchange for his'n, for a good long time to come, if they make up their minds to do so, jest as I hev done to the Ingins. And when they undertake that bisuess, old Sal and I will jine and give em a lift 1" "I didn't expect anything less of you, Nat!" exclaimed the planter, ex- tending his hand, which the scalp hunter grasped warmly in his large vie- like palm. "As for me," continued Neil Somers, taking of his cap, and lift- ing up his eyes reverently, "I have already pledged myself i siglt of the Great Supreme, to give my thoughts, my heart, my hand, may vexyr wgy, to my country in her struggle with this proud, bad man, this uMa utii W pressive Kingl"    o 1 MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.          9 CHAPTER II. "That is like yew, Neil!" said the scalp hunter, in admiration. "I hev known yew ever since you were knee high, and yew was allers the same pure-minded and high-souled creeter. Let what will turn up, you will all'ers be found on the right side. I knowV yew Neil, and I like yew, because I hev all'ers found yew of the right stripe and of the rate ginooine grit in every thing. I hev remarked you for a good menny years, and at all times with pleasure. Every family all'ers has sun one in it who is better than all the others put together. Sumtimes it is the oldest, at others the youngest-and then agin it ain't in the father nor the children, but in the mother; but every family has its angel, whose modest, quiet, noble, uncomplaining spirit redeems partially all that is bad and ignoble in the rest. In your family, Neil, yew he v ever been the angel.' Nay, blush not-yew know Nat Akarman is no flatterer, and that what he says he means. Trew worth never travels along the highroad of life, without having a. certain amount of moral weight and influence hangin' to its coat, which all men are willin' to acknowledge the strength of; and a few ready to hold up. Now I regard yew as a truth tellin' man, and your word is 'titled to respect; and when yew say yew believe the people air in 'arnest, and that you intend to follow 'em in their struggle I feel that I am bound to believe yew, and to follow yew tu, when and wherever yew may go!' "Thank you-thank you, Nat-thank you!" said the planter, pressing his hand-with a slight degree of emotion. "'Tis thus, with confidence like yours, that men should enlist in the sacred cause of humanity!" "But yew hev not told me all, Neil," said the scalp hunter regardinghim earnestly. "There's -a suthin' in your eye which is as yet unuttered; a suthin' that strikes home. Suthin' has gone wrong with yew. What is it? I kin read a suthin' in your manner, which tells me your heart is bleedin. What is it? Kin I du enny thing for you-if so, say it! Yew are at that age when men take a sartain fever-yew know what I mean, don't yew?- the heart's disease. 1s't that? Has your sweetheart, Amy Winter, quar- relled with you?"  He paused, and tHe smile which accomnpanied his last observation, disap- peared, and its place was instantly taken by an expression of intense anxiety. "Why, Neill" he continued, "what's the matter-yew don't blush when I pronounce Amy's name, but turn pale  What's the matter? ITev yew met her brother Dick in some nice, solitary spot, and made the varmint pay, for layin 'pobr Alice in her airly grave?" The young planter, with a violent effort drove back a spasm which this al- lusion to his lost sister called up, and mournfully shook hiis lead. "Oh, blast my old scalp!' exclaimed the woodsman, "here I've ben'gittin' on the wrong trail, and in so doin' draggin' up old memories which must make your heart ache wuss 'n pizin! I'm a big brute-wuss than a yal- ler belly! Kick me-cuss me-shoot me. Neil! I deserve it, wuss 'n a red skin "* The cloud passed away'from the planter's brow; the agony vanished in a great measure from his eye; and his face though still pale, became lighted up with a majestic and heavenly smile. He stretched forth his arm, and taking the scalp hunter's hand, pressed it, saying- "Between us, Nat, no secrets. -The arrows you threw were fi'iendly oncs, and left no poison where they struck. I have had no quarrel with Amy Winter, no meeting with her brother. I have no fear of the first, and now that the country has need of my life, I have no wish for the la,ter. Had we met previous to my visit to Charleston, one or both of us must have fallen"     10        THE SWAMP STEED; on THE DAYS "Still yew hev a grief," said the scalp hqimter, in a tone cf affectionate so- licitude. "Your mother-nuthin' has- befallen her?" Nea Somers was silent a moment: his eyes lowered thoughtfully on his rifle. At length, "Nat," said he, with a tranquil smile, " as I have already said, no secrets between us. You have known me from my childhood up till now, and are somewhat aware of the main outlines of my family's history, but not wholly. Let me now fariliarize you with the details, and you can then judge fairly of my position." "My father was a young and very handsome English officer; of a pleas- ing address, winning jmanners, and highly accomplished in all those little arts which render unscrupulous men successful with women. A younger son, he had nothing to hope from his parents, who, in educating and securing him a commission in the army, washed their hands of him and left him to shift for himself.  "He was at that time a heartless and unprincipled adventurer; greatly in debt, in continual fear of imprisonment, and saw no loophole of escape except through a mercenary marriage. There were however too many of his kind in London for him to expect to accomplish any thing there, and he found himself under the necessity of looking somewhere else for a victim. "After a season he selected Somersetshire for the scene of his matrimonial adventure, and accordingly posted thither. He put up at the best inn in the village at which he stopped, made love to and seduced the landlord's daugh- ter, and during his liason with her, spared nothing to make himself familiar with the character and pecuniary condition of the inhabitants. "Not satisfied with one victim, he pursued his libertine career in almost every family in which his engaging appearance, winning manners and fasci- nating conversational powers had gained him a footing. At length, his clha- acter began to be understood, and one door after another was closed upon him, till none remained open to him but those of his victims, each of whom his specious tongue had persuaded was the favored one. dIn time, however, even these were shut, and legal proceedings were about to be instituted against him. "He was cut off from every chance of escape, and universally execrated. "To crown his critical position, warrants were out against him for debt, and he was liable every mdment to arrest.  "In this situation his confidence deserted him, and he scarcely knew what to think or do. "Where he had the least right to look for help, thereit appeared. "He was sitting one evening in his room at the inn, when his first victim hurriedly opened the door, and in a voice of deep agtation exclaimed- "Oh, Lionel! take this purse-it contains fifty guineas-and fly! My father has discovered my relations with you, and has gone to the magistrate's at the next town to have you arrested. He will be back at daylight and then you will be lost Worse than that-two officers have just arrived from Lon- don with writs against you for debt. They are now in the house, and con- certing to take you by surprise in the morning. Fly, or you are lost!" "'How can I fly?' said he: - "I have ordered Tom the ostler to lead a horse and wagon to the cross road. You will find it there. Qh, fly not a moment is to be lost!' "He took the purse unblushingly, thrust it into his pocket, and giving her a hasty embrace, slipped out of the inn, flew up the avenue to the cross roads, where he found the horse and wagon, threw the ostler a shilling, and seizing the whip ard rein, took the road leading, as he supposed, to Iondon. "He drove all night, and entered a small village, just as dawn was break- ing. But his horse was ruined. The animal had been driven so hard, that it foundered and fell dead of posite a handsome cottage, where dwelt a re-   H OF MARION AND HS METRY  BEN.         1 tired merchant and his only daughter, who had witnessed the incident from their windows.      / "He was invited into the house, where he soon made himself at home, and by a romantic story about losing his way on his route to London, created in them an interest in his favor vhich was equally shared by father and daugh- ter, who, fascinated by his air and conversation, urged him to spend a few weeks with them, an invitation he did not permit them to repeat. In a few days, he learned enough of their positipn to convince him that here was the golden egg he had so long been seeking; and he forthwith set all of his powers in play to win the young lady's heart. "Unaccustomed to the society of such men, ignorant of the world and the arts of its adventurers, she regarded Lionel as the most fascinating and ac- complished man in the world, and yielded her love to him who sought it not for its own richness, but for the wealth that followed it. His romantic story of being an orphan, without kindred or friends, was readily believed, and the merchant, living only for his daughter's haplpnessi, rashly gave his consent to their hasty union, and they were married without any farther ceremony than that which the church imposed. "But scarcely had their honey-moon begun, when his London creditors discovered his whereabouts and position, and pounced upon him. The mer- chant however, calmly settled their claims, and manifested no surprise on learning through them the real history of his son-in-law; and although he was somewhat staggered by the discovery, he kept the secret to himself and al- lowed the honey-moon to pass over without acquainting his daughter with it. "In a few months, the details of Lionel's career at the village in Sorner- setshire reached his ears, and so horrified him, that it brought on a paralysis which eventually killed him. "At her father's death, Alice, his daughter, took possession of his proper- ty and having by that time learned en9ugh relative to her husband to retain te control of the property in her own hands, she did so: allowing hir enough however to live handsomely, provided he indulged in no heavy cx- travagances "But the poor creature's heart was crushed; the caresses which she showered upon her infant boy were always accompanied with tears. Silent and uncomplaining, she bore his indifference, desertion and neglect without a murmur; and to set her cup of misery running over, reports of his libertine career in the village in which they lived were continually pouring in upon her, and adding fresh agonies to her heart. "By the advice of her friends, she cut off a large share of his income, and then settled the whole of her property and wealth upon her child. This at first led to fierce and violent reproaches on his part, and subsequently even to blows! This she could not endure, and a separation was the consequence. "In a few months the libertine's outward conduct changed; he even car- ried his hypocrisy so far as to send her a letter affecting sorrow and contrition for his past life, begging her forgiveness of his errors, stating that he was on the point of leaving England forever, as his shame would not permit him to remain in a land where dwelt one whom he had so foully outraged and so violently wronged, and entreating as a favor, not a right, the privilege of cal- ling on her and bidding her and his boy a parting adieu. Innocent and guileless, she fell into the snare, and sent him a note con- senting to the interview. Th, consequences were natural, when, of the two parties to that meeting, the .one was an artful, designing and smooth-lipped hypocrite, and the other a weak, credulous, inexperienced and forgiving woman. The pretended journey to another clime was abandoned-the past, forgiven and forgotten-the husband and wife reunited-and happiness re- stored to at least one heart. s     12        THE SWAAPT STEED; OR TIE DAYS From that hour all was apparently well; the libertine appeared to have discovered and appreciated the villainy of his career, repented and reformed; the dark lel-'- of the past had vanished, and light was once more restored to the household. Weeks passed away thus into months, the months into a year; and at the end of that time misery returned again to the husband and the wife, but without dividing them-their boy died, and they were childless. "The days of mourning passed away, and the bereaved mother consoled herself for the loss of her little one with the tenderness and caresses of her Lionel, whose affection appeared to grow stronger and deeper with each suc- ceeding day. "At length, when there could no longer be any lingering doubts of the genuineness of lhis reformation, his affection, or his caresses, he said to her: "' My Alice, let us quit these scenes made sad to us by my errors, and the death of our child, and go in search of fresh happiness on the shores of the New World-that land of loveliness and romance. There let us build us a cot 6n the banks of one of its silver lakes, and there, beneath the green: vine and the sweet scented air, let us glide down the stream of time .happy and joyous as two loving hearts who have no thoughts but for each other!' "The credulous wife, never dreaming of the black treachery hidden beneath this request, and desiring nothing but the happiness of him who appeared to love her so fondly, acceded to his desire, and they made preparations to leave England. "A few weeks only were necessary to complete their arrangements, and when every thing was in readiness they took ship, set sail, and ere long stood on the shores of America. "They landed at Charleston, where they remained for a short season till they had completed the purchase of a plantation near Kingstree, where I was born. "Herle they lived happily, till in an evil hour, my mother, who till that time had retained the major part of her property in her own right, turned it over to my father. Then he dropped the mask-the fruits of his hypocrisy were in his hand, and from that hour he was a brute, and she a weak, appal- led and affrighted slave. True, there were occasional moments when his brutal nature slept, and his better angel awoke, and in these fits he was all love, gentleness and kindness; but such instances were rare, and when they came, but faintly atoned for his harsh and ignoble treatment in the long -in- tervals between them. "When I was about five years old, my mother gave birth to two twin babes; they were boys, and it was hoped that the singular similarity of'their features, their innocent caresses, and the close resemblance they bore to the author of' their being would be enough to win back the gentle nature of their father. "This hope was not wholly disappointed. He abandoned in a measure his libertine habits, spent more of his time at home and less of it abroad, and in fine became less of a devil, and more of a man. He treated my mother some- what more generously, and appeared to a certain degree reformed. ':All this brought once more a partial happiness to our household; the bloom that had vanished from my mother's cheek returned; her eye that had so long been dimmed with sorrow, brightened again, under the genial sun- shine that hovered around her home. "When I was about eight years old, my sister Alice vas born. You re- member her, Nat-don't you, she was the picture of her mother, The twiis, Frederick and George, were about three years old at the time, and were re- markable for their precocious intellects and matchless beauty, and my father was accustomed to take 'them with him in his rides and jaunts around the provine '. "One morning, about a fortnight after the birth of my sister, he took a   OF MABION AND HS MERRY MMt.          13 large amount of money from the house, and, saying that he intended to go a little ways up the province to complete the purchase of a plantation of which we had frequently heard him speak, ordered the twins to be got ready, as he intended to take them with him. While this was being done, he command- ed a slave to harness his favorite mare to the family gig, and lead her round to the gate.  "As his was an imperious nature, he Was speedily obeyed in both cases; when taking the twins into the vehicle, he seated himself between them, and  without even a simple adieu, drove off. "That day passed away, and the next, and the day following that, but brought no tidings of them. "On the morning of the fourth day, my mother, whose distress you per- haps can fancy, went to lir escrutoir, from whence my father had taken the money, and there to her amazement discovered a small note addressed to herself, and written in a hand that she recognized in an instant. She opened it, and read as follows:- "'I have purposely deceived you. I am not going to buy another panta- tion, but to visit England, where I shall remain. Frederick and George, who in all things resemble their father, will go with me-you have seen them for the last time. Neil and Alice, who in all things remind one of their mother, you can keep. I leave you the plantation, the slaves, and three thousand pounds in cash; they are enough to support three persons. The remaining seventeen thousand pounds I shall carry with me. Adieu I "ONEL SOME1RS.' "My mother was appalled, bewildered, stunned, on reading this cruel letter, and fell to the floor like one struck by a shaft of lightning. "Her attendants, in alarm, called in two or three of the neighbors, who on perceiving the crumpled note in her clenched hand, and supposing it would prove a key to her swoon strove to withdraw it; but in vain-she clasped it with the tenacity of steel: it was not till the third day of her inert state that her senses returned, her feelings melted, and her hand unlocked. "But it was too late to hope 'o come up with the deserter, who was six days in advance of his pursuers, who, on reaching Charleston discovered that my father, with his twin sons, had sailed three days before for England, and was then upon the sea. "My mother's gentle nature yielded for a season to this rude blow; and then her spirit rose to encounter the cares of conducting her estate. But nature had not endowed he vrith business attributes. The plantation, in her hands, as well in those whom she had successively engaged to manage it, was a losing property. In a ew years it was covered with debts and mort- gages, the latter held by Abel Winter, a neighboring planter, who took, one after another of our slavus to satisfy his claims till scarcely a negro was left to cultivate our fields. "On reaching my seventeenth year, my mother entrusted the management of the entire estate to my hands. Brought up in a household of trials and privations, my mind was active, energetic, observing and reflective. "My first step was to discover the actual position of the estate. I found iane mortgage and a few small debts. To take up the first, I persuaded my mother to convey to Mr. Winter, the holder of the claim, one-third of our funds; the sale of another eighth liquidated the second, and the plantation was thus reduced to one half its original size and value: but that half was free and unencumbered, ' We had now only twenty negroes, but that number was quite enough to work our fields, which, soon began to tell favorably, and our plantation ere otg wore a thrifty and profitable aspect. "In a few years, we were easy and comfortable; our rice fields, thorough-     "       THE 3sWALP STEED ; Ot THEE DAVS. ly cultivated, made ius noble returns; our negroes, carefully attended and kindly treated, loved us and repaid our kindness by making our interests their own; our exchequer was well lined, and, except in our domestic calamities, we had nothing to disturb us. "It was at this time that Richard Winter paid his addresses to mny sister. She was young, artless, credulous and--" The planter paused; a mist passed over his eyes; his voice became thick and dry; the muscles of his countenance twitched with an internal spasm; a tremor passed over his whole frame, and then again all was calm. His eyes became clear and dry; his voice distinct and moist; the muscles of his face lay tranquil; and his breast was calm as though it had never known aught to disturb its repose. "She became his victim, as many another had become the victim of her father. She reposes in a quiet corner of the village churchyard, with no stone or other sign to mark her resting place, or tell the world of the shame that paled her cheek, of the grief that consumed her heart, of the woe which, like a serpent's tongue, in the brief period of three months made her first a victim, then a crushed and tottering skeleton, and then a corse. "She kept the secret of her grief from all till she felt she was about to die; then eommitting it to paper, which she hid beneath her pillow, she laid her- self down, and her meek, bruised spirit passed quietly away to the land of shadows. "After her death, the paper and its, secret were discovered. My mother, of all our household, alone was calm. A slight spasm coursed for a moment through her frame; another and a deeper shade of paleness settled upon her features, and then all was tranquil as before. "As for me, I sprang upon my horse, and flew to the house of her seducer, forgetting in my frenzy that he had left it, on a visit to another part of the province some twh weeks before. "I saw his father, who affected astonishment and sympathy. I saw Amy, who affected nothing; but who wrung her hands in anguish at her brother's villainy; in shame, for the dishonor his treachery had brought upon the family name; and in sympathy for me, for her heart had long beat in harmonious response to every throb of mine.  "I would have pursued and slain him; but my mother, laying her small, pale hand on my arm, looked at me with her calm, impressive eye, and said - Leave him; my son, in the hands of God; it is my wish ' "I got off my horse, and obeyed her, as I had ever been accustomed to from my earliest infancy till then, although it nearly broke my heart. 'Pa- tience, my son,' she added, with a smile, which was sublime in its tranquility and sweetness, 'vengeance is not ours, but His'  "I could not dispute with, nor say an angry word to, my mother. Sh6 gave me her love, her heart, her affection; I owed her in return at least obedience 1 "t Some weeks ago, business called me to Charleston. There I found every body in a state of agitation relative to the tyrannic proceedings of the King. The city was in a ferment. Young men were gloomy, old men threatening, brows; eyes flashed here, there and every where, like rapiers leaping from their scabbards in the sunlight. I did not understand it; and asked the mat- ter. 'The King says he'll tax us as much as he pleases,' was the reply, and will not even let us choose our own provincial officers. We are henceforth to have no voice in public affairs, no elections, no representatives. The King will force upon us for rulers just such creatures as he'pleases; we are to have no say in any thing, we are to submit to the condition and position of vas- sals, and to bow our necks and submit to be kicked, cuffed and robbed as often as it shall please King George. We are to be taxed and trampled upon according to his majesty's giod will' and pleasure, and if we murmur, we are   OPl MAI'ON AND HiS A1ERiiY MEN.       15 to be arrested and thrown int&the provost, and be left there to 'rot till we learn to bow in servile submissioni to every decree that may spring from the royal noddle.' My blood became agitated as I heard this; and I remembered the mur- murs of discontent which I had heard for long months in Kingstree, and other parts of the district of Williamsburgh. 'Blood will grow out of this,' I mut- tered; for the Caroliniansiare proud, intelligent and brave, and not of a breed accustomed to lick the hand that smites 'em 1' "Nor was I wrong in my conjecture. The'people hold private meetings, to one of which my known liberal opinions secured me an invitation; and I learned that fley had determined to upset as much as possible the grasping calculations of the government-by doing mischief for the public weal-de- stroying goods belonging to that great monopoly patronized and sustained by the ministry, namely, the East India Company; destroying teas and dry goods, throwing overboard every thing which the government have been in the habit of oppressing the people by laying high taxes upon. "Engaged commonly in this work, I found all ranks; and prominent in it, the noblest, purest, bravest, and most intelligent men of the province; and I resolved, come what would, that in the hour, which I foresaw must conie, when the people rose up in the name of suffering humanity to shake off the grasp of the tyrant and punish the insolence of his minions, Neil Somers would, so help him God I march in their ranks, with his sword on his. thigh, his-war-belt on his shoulder, and his good rifle in his hand. "One day I encountered a gentleman whose political opinions jarred on coming in contact with mine; we discussed the recent acts of the King, he taking he side of the tyrant, I that of the people. We were warm, but not abusive in the discussion, and when we parted, it was with feelings of mutual respect for each others honor as men, if not of admiration for each, other's controversial powers. "The day following, he sent me an invitation to a ball to be held that evening at his house; and as the note accompanying it was couched in the most courteous terms, and coupled with a playful allusion to our discussion, I felt that it was imperative upon me not to slight, or reject it. "I made my appearance at his house about ten o'clock, and found the rooms Ailled with the elite of the city. The governor and his suite were there, together with the leading civil and military officers and citizens. Everything was gorgeous, brilliant and beautiful. "The evening wore on towards midnight. I was a lookelr-n, not a par- ticipant in the festivities: for such things have but little charm for me. About midnight, then, the cloth was laid, and the guests invited to the table. The ball room was in a short time almost wholly deserted. The musicians lad also vanished by a private door to indulge in the delights of a repast. "I was among the first to quit the table; for, having taken no exercise I had no appetite, and as for drink I never had any fondness for anything but water. The toasts were mainly political, and the company principally kings- men. I could not consistently with my views and principles listen to the first, and I had no sympathy with the second. I therefore, watched my op- portunity, and when all eyes were turned in another direction, I rose quietly and returned to the ball room, which was, as I have said, nearly though not quite deserted. "Without meaning it, I had placed myself in such a position that I could not fail to have a good view of the guests as they returned from the supper room. "It was while in this situation I hat I saw what I am now about to de- scribe; what startled me as though an earthquake had rent the flooring be-     16        THE SWAMP STEED  OR THE DAYS neath me; and what, in part, brought me here Nat, for your counsel and as- sistance: for it will show you my position.  "The door of the supper room opened, and the guests began slowly to re- turn. Among the first were some seven or eight merchants who, on reach- ing the ball room, came over and seated themselves in front of me upon a settee which was even with the floor, while the one I occupied was some in- ches 'above it. "The conspicuousness of my position was thus somewhat neutralized, while it in nowise interfered with the uninterrupted view I had of the gueste as, in twos and threes, they entered. "The commonalty having passed in, then followed the hos, arm-in-arm with his most conspicuous guest, the governor. "Behind the governor, and in his suite, followed three young beauties, daughters of the host, each escorted by a young officer, glittering in gold and scarlet, whose countenances, as they advanced one after the other, struck me first with amazement and then with confusion. "In the first I recognized Richard Winter, the destroyer of my sister. "In the other two, the form'and expression of feature, nay, the very fea- tures themselves, of my brutal and unprincipled father, whose clear, bold, handsome lineaments once seen could never be forgotten.  "I could not be mistaken. Age, appearance, expression-every thing corresponded. They were my twin brtthers, Frederick and George! "They had left the province, children; they had come back to it, men. "Strikingly similar, majestic, magnificently handsome, there was yet a something in their features which made me recoil in horror. "The same wild, heartless, libertine expression which marked the father's countenance, was to me, who note such things carefully, visible in theirs. "In the governor's suite, they were necessarily in the royal service; and educated in England, their political sympathies were of course with the King, and in case of a war between the provinces and George, they-my brothers, the offspring of the same womb that had given me life, who had drawn suste- nance from the same breast which had nursed my infancy,-would be found on the side of the tyrant, and their swords,' talents, energies and intellects drawn against their country I "All these thoughts passed through my brain with the rapidity of lights ning; and for a few moments I was stunned, bewildered, blind. "Meanwhile, they had entered the ball-room, and following the governor- posted themselves at some distance from me; so that, when I recovered, they were surrounded by a number of young guests, of both sexes; the one to do homage to' the lovely brunettes whom they were fascinating by their attentions, the other to attract the notice of the twins, who were in form anid feature superb types of Saxon masculine beauty. "Neither Richard Winter nor the twin brothers had noticed my presence in the ball-room; a fact which was 'highly gratifying particularly as an idea had struck me the instant that the cloud, which their unexpected appearance had thrown over my faculties, had lifted and passed away. I resolved to take my departure; but previously to that, it was essential to learn the address of the twins. "At this instant our host, catching the eye of one of the merchants on the settee in front of mine, approached; and while advancing, a slight motion of my hand attracted his attention, and our eyes exchanged the first greeting they had passed for the night. "In a few moments he had, with that happy tact peculiar to educated gentlemen, -interchanged civilities with those whose glances had called him to the spot, and then flung a quiet expression at me which plainly said, 'I am at your service.' "I motioned him to a seat beside me, which he at once comprehended a!    OT MARION AND HS MEiRRY  MEN.        17 and followed, and I then asked him in a whisper te names and positions o the twimn With that gentlemanly delicacy whi-h answers every question without the impertinence of demanding wherefore it is put, he replied that they were twin brothers who had arrived i Charleston only a few months befre; that, though attached to the army, the governor, who was struck witl their superior talents, had taken them to himself, and was to a certain extent their principal protector, that there was also a report that his excellency had some thoughts of allying them to his family by giving his two daughters to them in marriage. "'And their father?' said I. "'Oh, they have none,' was the reply. 'He died at home, that is to say in England, some three years ago.' "From this it was evident my host had not the slightest suspicion I de- sired this information for any other reason than to gratify a common curiosi- ty. Taking heart from this, I pursued my inquiries. "'They are fatherless then?'  "Yes, and motherless, too. Their mother died while they were in their infancy; and her death so afflicted the father that he sold out his estate-for it appears the brothers were born in one of our provinces and taking his two only children with him, returned to England. There he educated his sons for the army; but dying before they were of age, the remainder of their education fell upon a guardian, who was a gentleman of position and influ- ence, and who obtained for them all the opportunities and advantages essen- tial to success. In case of a war between the provinces and the King, the Governor will give them every opportunit to distinguish themselves. Their prospects are very brilliant, I assure you.' "Doubtless,' I answered. 'what did you say their names ere?' "'Frederick and George.' "And their family name?' tr 'Somers. By the bye, that reminds me you are namesakes. Shall I in- troduce you?' "No, I thank you,' I answered carelessly. 'I have no desire for an ac- quaintance.' "At this moment, the eye of the Governor caught that of the host, and the latter gracefully moved away from beside me, and passed down to wait upon his noble guest. "A  few minutes- afterward I took my departure from the house, and bent my steps homeward with a gloomy and thoughtful brow. "  It was very evident that the story of the twins as related by the hoft, was the current one in the city, and was perhaps believed by the twin brothers, themselves: but how nearly it approached the truth, you, Nat, wi are familiar with the real facts, can readily judge. "I called, the next day, upon the Governor, and obtained a private inler- view. Without compromising my   own secret, or position, I obtained front him the history of the twins as he had obtained it from their uardian, who obtained it from their father; as he had obtained it from the brothers them- selves, who had obtained it from their father in the first place, and their gua..- dian in the second. '   The account of the governor was merely a repetition of the outliuaes He- lated to me the preceding night at the ball "It was self-evident, then, that the fabrication of the death of my mother, the disposal of the estate, and the cause of his returh to England, was only another black leaf in the history of my father. "It was also equally as plain that he had trained up the twin brothers in utter ignorance of the existence of their mother. sister and m yself and died without 'eaking any revelation wlrich would convict hitn of the fraud he had 3t     18        THE SWAMP STEED; OR TIE DAYS imposed upon their young minds, or of the baseness and cruelty he had in- flicted upon their mother. "I retired from the cabinet of the Governor overwhelmed with grief, and trembling with despair. "On reaching my lodgings, I reconsidered, and as calmly as my feelings would permit, reviewed the whole matter-beginning with my parent's his- tory and ending with the discovery and story of my brothers. "Then I formed three resolutions; the first based upon political, the sec- ond and third upon private reasons. "The first was, that in the storm arising between the colonies and the crown, my brothers should not be found with their swords drawn against their country; the second, to reform their wicked dispositons, prevent them from following the heartless and libidinous career of their father, and gradual- ly prepare them for a meeting and re-union with their noble mother when they should have made themselves worthy of that high honor; the third, to keep the fact of their existence and arrival, as well as my father's death from my parent." The young planter paused. He was pale, but evinced no other sign of emotion. Every feature was resting tranquilly, but lit with that halo of re- flectiveness which is visible on the countenances of all great minds, and which tells that the fires of their intellectual genius are never permitted to die, because they are subdued to a calm, steady and ever-burning glow. "How du yew propose to du that, Neil?" said the scalp hunter, who had oeen surveying his companion for the last half hour with undisguised aston- ishment and admiration. "Listen," replied Neil. "You remember the old log house in the centre of the cypress wood?" The scalp hunter inclined his head affimatively, and the planter continued. "I propose taking my brothers by stratagem, and conveying them thither. There they will be secluded from the world, its passions, its fas- cinations, its excitements; there they will part one by one with their vices and errors, which lead to misery and destruction; there they will take up virtue, industry and justice, which lead to happiness and immortality." The planter's voice trembled as he spoke; the muscles of his countenance twitched sharply with the violence of his emotions: and a soft dew moist- ened the long, dark lashes of his eyes. "Yew love 'em, then, Neil, after all!" exclaimed the scalp hunter, in a burst of surprise, mingled with admiration. "Ah I are they not, for all their vices, my brothers still? Are they not, for all their father did, the same bright-eyed ones that played with me in my childhood, and for whom from the hour of their flight till that of their re- turn, my mother's lips and mine have nightly prayed to God!" "Your hand, Neil!" said the scalp hunter, in a voice that came up from- the lowest depths of his soul, your hand-nay, both; and your heart!" And they fell on each other's breast, dropping their heads each on the other's shoulder, and men though they were, were not ashamed of their tears. "Yew'll du it, Neil!" cried the scalp hunter, as he partially recovered his self possession; "yew'll du it, for the rale grit is in yew. Yew've got the geenis to trap 'em, and the will to carry it out-yew hev, and may my old Sal never drop anuther yaller belly Hef I don't take the scalp-off of any critter that attempts to step in between yew and the execution of your will 1"  "You will aid me then, Nat; you approve of my idea, and will help me to carry it into effect?"

Now that I have your consent, Nat, I will at once to Charleston and lay the train for their capture." W "But the old log house, Neil? Wunt it take a little time to get it ready? 'The house itself ain't exactly in condition. I hain't been there in a year or more, and then it warnt enny, tu kumfortable, I tell yew!" The planter smiled. "I had already thought of that, Nat. A firend spent the day up there !2'). ' yesterday, with my negroes: and they changed the appearance of it very much before they left, I assure you. And even while we speak, seven of  them are engaged in completing what was left undone yesterday, and giving to the house a habitable appearance, and to the clearing around it aln aspect of cultivation. Anxious to witness how Mowizon was plogressing, I put oni my hunting dress this morning as if going forth in quest of game, and pro- ceeded thither. Everything had met and even exceeded my expectatios. It was only by a great effort of my will that I succeeded in restraining an expression of joy. When I leftthe spot, the negroes had not the renlotest idea that I had not stumbled there, in the course of my jaunt, by )l urest accident." "The niggers are in the secret then?" said the scalp hunter, with anll x- pression of surprise. "No," answered the planter; "' no one is aware of it except ourselves." The scalp hunter appeared confounded, and in reply to his look of inquiry, the planter said : "Twas thus I manag-ed it. I want to a friend in the village, young Ned Mowizon, and told him" that a couple of friends of mine iwished to seclulde themselves for a time from the world; that they had chosen for that purpose the old log hut in the cypress grove, and wished it cleared away and nadle ready for occupation; that I did not desire to be known in the matter, and that I wished him to come to my plantation the following day and pretend in the hearing of those around me to employ my negroes for a day or two to clear up some ground; that I wished him to do this to oblige myself, o and to do it without asking me to explain anything fur ther, and thus save me the mortification of betraying a secret which it was highly necessary to keep. Mowizon had confidence enough in my honor to feel convinced that the affair, though a secret, was not a dishonorable one, and sufficient desire to accommodate me to at once undertake the task. He agreed, without any further questioning, and thus, without compromising my secret, every ,;lng is arranged for the reception of the brothers.' "I understand, Neil. But they will want help-fellers who, while they know how to make themselves useful, will take keer that tha critters doll t escape." "  All that is provided for," said the planter, with a quiet, yet melanrcholy smile. "   All things essential for their comfort, all things befitting men in the new life they are to enter, are already at or on their way to the log house. Mowizon is provided with money and a letter of instructions; and he is a man on whom   I can rely, I feel satisfied, that, should it even be necessary to take the brothers there to-night, everything would be in readiness for their reception." "Yew hev geeris for every thing," said the scalp hunter, admiringly. la'nt every man can du what he has the geenis to conceive; but yew, Neil, yew air one of the critters that can du as well talk. But what on airth is that feller down on the road up tu? May my old Sal never drop another yaller belly I ef he aint tearin' the meat off the'sides of his nag, as ef his spurs was made for scalpin' knives!

Look! the people are ruhmni out of their houses, affrighted and stupified as ef the day of judgment had come!" The planter strained his eyes down upon the road on the opposite side of the shore. It was as the scalp hunter had. in his quaint manner, described it. A carrier was dashing along the road on a bay courser with the fleet-" ness of a whirlwind, as if life were the price of his speed, death the cost of delay; halting, every now and then, as he passed a house or field where faces were seen, and after pronouncing a few words, which seemed to throw his auditors into the wildest commotion, then again speeding' onward with the rapidity of light. "You are right, Nat," said the planter, with a mournfil smile, as he drew his eyes from the scene, "there is something in it; something that appeals to you and to me, as searchingly as to those down yonder. As for me, though I suspect, I yet would hear what are the tidings yon courier brings. It may be fancy only; and yet I think I know that messnoger's face." The sharp, clear, glittering orbs of the woodsman'were upon him in an in- stant. "Yew are right, Neill" he said; "and yet I hadn't an idee there was another pair of peepers besides mine in Sou' Carliny that could carry across the. Santee. I knowed the varmint at a glance, but didn't want to say nuthin, cause I knowed his name was wuss than red skin to your ear, and I didn't keer to see yew disturbed. But now you du know it, the mischief's up and can't be helped." "Tis no matter," said the planter. "Our day of reckoning is not now, un- less he throws hlmself across my path; I will not go in search of him." The scalp hunter surveyed his companion as if he had not comprehended him. "Understand me, Nat," said the planter, with a majestic and impressive air. ' No man knows better than myself what is due to my honor.. I have duly weighed the account that stands 'twixt Richard Winter and myself, and this is my decision: He is safe from hand of mine till my country's cause shall have no further need of Neil Somers or his sword. Then, and not till, then, shall I go in quest of him. Then, and not till then, shall vengeance awake firom her repose. Then, and not till then shall I demand atonement for the outrage our house has suffered at his hands. Then, and not till then, shall I say to him-' Richard Winter, life will have life, blood will have blood, death will have death: I have come to sit in judgment upon you for destroy- ing 'the honor, the peace and the life of my sister!'" With these words, the planter turned from the ledge and the tree; and throwing hislrifle across his shoulder as before, he bent his way once agin through the wood, accompanied by the scalp hunter, whose bowed head, pale cheeks, quivering lips and humid eyes, told how much he was affected by the mournful air of his friend, and how truly he appreciated that pure and up- right spirit whose every sentiment was based upon pure justice and clothed in such supreme grandeur. CHAPTER III. TnEY did not exchange a word til they had reached the woodsman's lodge, when the latter said: "A moment, Neil. I want to take up some'n." The planter paused, merely making a slight bow in reply; and the woods- man entrred the lodge.   OF MARION AND 1IS MEIlRY MEN.         21 He returned ere long with a bunch of stout thongs formed from the un- dressed skin of a buck. "You have been making a bridle?" said the planter, glancing at the thongs. *SBi    "  "Yes," returned the scalp hunter. "Only I hev two here. One on 'cm I made, and I s'pose I kin say I 'made' the other; but not in the usuil way.  t  epau   ' as ifhe had something more to say, but would not utter it then.  Neil Somers noticing this, forbore, with the delicacy peculiar to an exalted mind, to ask an explanation which the scalp hunter, for some private reason,  appeared to have no disposition to volunteer. Neither had as yet spoken to the other of the place of his destination. Nor was it necessary. They felt that they were companions, tavelling the ame road for the same object, each intuitively comprehending the other's tholghts of what they were going to hearkind what most likely to see; and both iknowing and feeling that what they were about to hear and see would turn into a rivet which would bind them closer still together and unite them t ke a chain of steel for many a long day. They struck out of the clearing facing the lodge into the same piece of wood which the planter had traversed on his route to the scalp hunter's, and began slowly to descend the hill. They had not proceeded more than eighty or ninety paces, when the woodsman, quietly signing to his companion to follow, turned off to the left, towards a high, moss-covered rock, which was faintly visible through the trees. A few moments brought them to the spot, when a peculiar odor in the air warned the planter that he was standing in the neighborhood of a concealed stable.     .                r    The woodsman looked all around him cautiously for a few moments to see if he was perceived; when satisfied upon this point, he quietly stooped down and bent his ear to the earth. But, as nothing in the shape of a human form had previously met his eye; so now, on listening, his ear detected no foot- steps. With a smile of satisfaction, he then rose, and proceeded tdwards a corner of the rock where lay, as though it had been wrenched by a tornado from its native tree and thrown down where it stood, the long-branching arm of a scyamore, its leaves yellow and witped by the sun and decay. This the woodsman drew slightly aside; then removing a long, wide bark which it covered, exposed to the somewhat astonished eyes of the planter, the mouth of a dark cave, with a 'natural and gradual sloping descent ter- minating at a depth of about five feet. below the level of the earth around the rock. and leading to the planter could not guess where. "This, Neil," said the scalp hunter, with a quiet smile, "is my stable and the hidin' place of my ch'ice things. Herne I keep the powder and lead which I gather up from the yaller bellies wnenever a bark from old Sal sends 'em skootin' up to glory. Here I keep my hlrses, and all the other spiles which I take from the red skins. They're parfectly safe from the horse thieves, and, ceptin' us two, the place aint known to a livin' soul. Wait a minit-I didn't bring yew here for nuthin'!" So saying, the woodsman slowly entered the cave, and disappeared. In t few minutes the planter heard his voices ringing in the cave, and utter- ing, at intervals- Be still, will yew, now!  That's it-that's it, now I Is the critter glad to see her old Natty back agin ! Ha! hal ha I thats' right; old gal,-put your head thar'  Hold still a leetle, for Natty's come to take her out on a rip I 1o I ho I she likes it, does she? I thought so, old gal-I thought so I Now e 1      22        Toq S'YAmI STEED; OR TH DAY1T come along-that's it-so, so--here we are-aint she a bewtee, now Now, then-gently, old gal, gently; there's no knowin' who may be about l The next moment there appeared at the mouth of the cave, witl a thong bridle hanging from its neck, a long, lank, dingy, cream-colored mare, whose general appearance was so wretched and wo-begone, that it seemed as if she suspected her owner had discovered her old, worn-out and valueless, and turned her out to die. The animal was, however, neither wretched in her movements nor bereft of intelligence. In compliance with the order of her master, she crept up the sloping path with the quietness of a fox: and on reaching the level of the brushwood, moved off quietly towards the farther side of the rock, when she as quietly turned, and standing stock still, threw her eyes intelligently around as if to take in a clear view of everything and every body About 1 her, dropped them quietly an instant or two upon the plaiter, and then fixed them expectantly upon the entranie of the cave, where stood the woodsman smiling his approbation at the correctness with which she had followed his order. The intelligent animal seemed to understand that her effort was apprez ciated: and was so pleased with her master's applause, that she displayedher teeth, tossed up her head, drew herself up, and raising one of her fore feet quietly pawed the air, and then let it drop, without making as much noise as would alarm a mosquito. The woodsman shrugged his shoulders admiringly, and making her a sign to be motionless till his return, retreated again into the cave. we had been gone but a few minutes, when he re-appeared, holding by the bridle a young, coal-black charger, whose fierce, restless spirit, as it came rushing up the slope, seemed to disdain the meddling bit, which it champed indignantly ; and to regard with scorn the strength and towering form of the woodsman, whom it threatened every moment to break from, and then dash in pieces. The planter could scarcely restrain a burst of admiration at sight of the magnificent animal. The restless movements of the noble steed, as it reared and plunged, in its efforts to shake off the powerful hold of the woodsman, would not permit the planter to take a deliberate view of its points. He could only catch momentary glimpses of its two small ears, shaped like spear points; of its large, clear black eyes flashing indignant lightnings; of its bold, broad nostrils, red as blood, and throwing forth a fierce, hot breath glowing like the light rays of the sun as it streams through the windows of a building; of its high, arching neck, fringed with a deep, flowing mane, that tossed with its every movement like a slight rolling billow; of its deep, broad chest, that seemed as if about to burst with indignant wrath' of its small, tapering limbs, on which the full charged veins shone like rods of steel; and of its long, switch tail that swept the air like a fan. Its skin of a glossy, spot- less black, shone with every rear and plunge, like a flash of light, and spoke -of youth, vigoo and health, as well as of pure and noble blood. Aint he a proud critter, Neil?" cried the scalp hunter, with a light laugh, as he strove to bring the animal to a stand; " wouldn't yew think now, by his leapin' and tearing' and his capers, to crush me under his hoofs, that he was King George himself strugglin' to trample down the people? And yet the varmint was raised among the cussed yaller bellies, and aint got no more right 'to treat a decent 'feller in this way than a rattle snake has to throw his pizen at a white man l" "Where did you obtain him, Nat?" said the planter. "Out on the borders, one day, when huntin' scalps. I'd got into a swamp and was lookin' out for a fresh trail, when I suddenly stumbled on about a a dozen of the varmint, camped in the grass. 'Foe they knowed wher.   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEWN.         23 they was, old Sal guv a bark, and one of tne - varmint made a spring as ef he intended to jump right thru to heving; then clubbin' the old critter I pitched right in among 'em, and sogged em so, that they hadn't time to ketch their wits. Only five on 'em showed grit, but old Sal's butt end crunched 'em quicker 'n chain lightnin', and they caved in like so many rotten sheep. There warn't then only one varmint left, but he was mounted on 'bout the 'tarnalest piece of horse meat yew ever heerd on. Ef old Sal had been charged and rammed down, I wouldn't a keerd; but she warn't; and the first glimpse I had of the sarpint was, as he was standin' on the boss's back, and takin' a deliberate aim,with his rifle at my head. I was kind a skeeryjest at that minit; but bein' as I didn't feel as ef I wanted to. swallow lead, I dropped quicker 'n chain lightnin', and jest at that ins'nt I heerd the bullet a whizzen past as ef it thought it had hit somebody. The cunnin var- mint hadn't no idee'of givin' a feller time to load, but findin' his lead hadn't done no harm, drove right up with the notion of tramplin and clubbin' me on the head, afore I had time to git up. But I'd been raised 'mong folks who'd fout Ingen afore then; and so, on droppin', I crawled quicker 'n a painter thru the grass, and when the varmint had got to the spot where he'd seen me fall, I wasn't thar! 'Old Sal was greased and rammed down in no time, and then I lifted myself up 'a little sly, and cuss me, ef the yaller belly wasn't a dodgin' round in a circle, on that 'tarnal hoss of his'n, his eyes ruu- nin' every where, and his rifle clubbed and ready to split at a moment's warnin'. He didn't see me till I yelled, but as his eyes fell on me, old Sal barked, and he dropped from the back of his steed as ef lightnin' had touched him. And then I heerd a screech-it warn't nuthin' like a iat'ral whinney, from the hoss, as ef the death of the varmint had touched its vitals. I said nuthin' but out with my knife and whittled off the scalps; but when I went up to take that of the boss's rider, yew oughter seed it The critter yelled wuss 'n a painter; it reared and plunged around the body, and wouldn't let a feller come near it at any price. I didn't want to kill the ani- mal, and I did want the scalp; and as matters looked, to git the one I should hev to du the other. The case puzzled me. Thinks I, I1 wait. So I pre- tends to move away, but on goin' a little distance I dropped down in the grass, .and laid still, tu see what the critter would du. In a little while I crawled keerfully towards the red skin, and there I seed the animal sprawlin' down by his body, kissin' the face, and moanin' as ef its heart was broke. Thinks I, I wunt hurt that critter's feelins by takin his master's scalp, but I'll jest snake him, and take him hum. By and bye, the critter's dreadful suffer- ins threw him into a sleep: and then I crept along on all fours till one spring brought the bridle in my hand and me upon his back. In a moment, the critter woke, as ef he couldn't believe himself; then starting up, he raised on his hind legs as ef he thought he could land me then he pitched forward on a flyin' run for nigh on to about thirty yards, and then dropped sudden as lightnin': but he didn't du it, and findin that trick warn't likely to answer, he tried all sorts ofrairin' and plungin' to 'complish it. But it warn't no mortil use I was as perfectly to hum on his back, as ef I had been asleep on bar skins; and when the critter seed that, he guy in, and pickin up - the'spiles from the varmint I had scalped, I druv him hum and put him in the stable here. I aint had him out more'n once or twice since: but ho und'stands me well enough, for all his airs now, to know that he couldn't toss me, ef he is a tairer." This sketch of the gallant steed was told by fits and jerks, as the scalp hunter strove to bring him to a stand; and not in the rapid and connected manner we have related it. It was only when the woodsman had brought the anecdote to a close, that the horse ceased to struggle, and to champ his bits calmly. "Neil," continued the scalp hunter, "I want yew to take this critter and     24  V. T-. SWATAr STEED; on THE DAYS keen him; and I don't want yew to refuse nuther-ef you du I shall feel hurt 'Taint every man that I'd give such an animal to: but you are to me like a brother, and I know yew'll take keer of the critter for the sake of the giver." This was one of those situations in which it would have been cruel to de- cline, and Neil, with a bow expressive of his feelings, sprang upon the back of the gallant steed, and taking the rein in one hand, patted the animal gently on the neck with the other, and in a few moments the pair appeared to be the best friends in the world. The woodsman re-covered the mouth of the cave with the bark screen; returned the sycamore arm to its former position; and then advanced to- wards his cream colored mare, whose sleepy looking eyes expanded and beamed with. pleasure as he approached, and who crouched down so as to permit him to mount without the slightestinconvenience. The woodsman patted her fondly on the neck: "Ah, yew are a fine old gal, Nell! Now, gently, Nell-gently, old gal, and teach that young swamp steed a lesson how to take his rider through the brush without tellin' tales." The old lady thus flattered, felt herself upon her metal; and, as if com- prehending every word of her master, glided through the wood with a ra- pidity and quietness that would have astonished any one but an experienced denizen of the wild woods. But, if Nell was an adept at this business, the gallant young swamp steed was not exactly an amateur. His steps were quicker, but his footfalls not less light than the old lady's; and he carried himself and rider through the tor- tuous windings of the wood with a speed and cautiousness that told nobly for his Indian education, When they had reached the bottom of the hill and entered upon the level highway leading to the river side, the young steed carried himself with a swaggering independence which informed the cream-colored lady that he didn t think she had taught him such a great deal, after all. Here the parties took the ferry boat which plied at this point between the two shores, and were transported, after some delay, to the other side of the river. It was late when they reached the opposite shore, and the two friends'found it necessary to give their animals a free rein, if they desired to reach the house of the planter in anything like season for repose. The mare was'slender, long limbed and fleet as a racer. Her movements were light, easy and supple, and she sped over the road with a grace, confi- dence and swiftness which caused the eye of her rider to sparkle with admi- ration and pride. The animal evidently felt that her reputation, as a courser was at stake, and threw herself out as if conscious of her ability to main- tain it. The swamp steed appeared to be conscious that his reputation as a gallant animal was yet to 6e achieved, but felt equally as confident that he possessed the bottom to obtain it. He tossed his small, princely head with a proud, defiant air; threw a scornful glance at the cream-colored lady at his side, opened his mouth and nostrils as if to imbibe a long draught of air; stretched his limbs an instant as if to call up all his elasticity and nerve, then sprang forwardand shot along the road like an arrow. From that moment, the farm houses, fences and trees skirting the way sides appeared to the riders like a moving panorama. The coursers did not run-they flew. The uneven high road was no longer an undulating path- way, but a rolling sea, and the coursers, ships skimming over the breakers; now lost for an instant in the hollow, oscillating cradles, the next appearing upon the summits of the billows, and then speeding onward with a rapidity t't threatened death to everything that might be in their path.   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.           2 Riding in this manner, they reached the planter's house in a few hours, when weary and exhausted, they threw themselves from their horses and sought in slumber to recruit their energies to encounter the dangers and ex- citements which their hearts forewarned them would confront them on the morrow. CHAPTER IV. TIE morning of the following day opened with a thick impenetrable mist, which hung like a gray shroud over the hills and valleys-fit emblem of the gloom that overshadowed the hearts of the people: and a type of the destiny of the colonies, which was at that period vague, mournful, and threatening. By eight o'clock, however, the fog rose slowly from the earth till it was high above the hills; the sun launched its golden streams through the rapidly melting clouds, clothing them with its glittering light, and bathing h1e woods and fields in the bright yellow of its radiant glow. The emerald fields, the slopes far up the hill sides, sparkled with the glit- tering dew drops that lingered upon their blades; the bubbling brooks the creeping rivulets, and the running streams. shone like lakes of molten silver; the air was perfumed with the balmy odo:rs of clover, sweet-brier, wild flow- ers and thyme; from copse and wood the feathered songsters chanted an- thems of praise and joy in voices of rich melody: all nature was clothed in the bright garments of a bride. Man alone wore a brow of gloom. WiAT liirn the sunlight was-not a stream of gold, but a lake of iron, forging itself int chains; witlh im the green fields were not objects of beauty to nwhich he was to look for bread but cemeteries in one of which he was soon to find a grave; with him, the laugh- ing brooks, the murmuring rivulets and cdlshing streams were but tears that he and his had shed; the songs of birds were not hymns of praise, but dirges of mourning. The roads that branched off from Kingstree, the county town of the Dis- trict of Williamsburgh, presented on the morning in question a picturesque and stirring sight.                      t  Men on horseback and on foot, variously armed with rifles, guns, pitch- forks and axes, were seen hurrying along towards Kingstree; scarcely utter- ing a word as they proceeded, and all with scowling brows, pale cheeks, clenched haSds, and quivering nostrils; allbent upon some errand, judging by their excited air and-manner, which had for each arid all a terrible in- terest. By nine o'clock, the town of Kingstree was alive with men like these.' Every brow, whatever its rank in the social scale, whatever its age on the scroll of time; wore a fierce and thoughtful look; men congregated here and there in knots of twos and threes and tens, and listened with varied feelings to some one in their midst from whose lips could every now and then be heard the words-"Lexington, 19th April-without warning-people in arms-cold blood "And these words were cabalistic; and cheeks around the speaker paled; lips were closed and drawn back agniinst the teeth, till they all but forced the latter in; nostrils quivered; breathnugs grew llot and quick; eyes flashed lightnings; brows waxed blacker; alld hands grasped rmer such weapons as they held. They were in all guises, too, these men ; the broadcloth of the planter, the homespun of the farmer, the make shift of the laborer, and, the buckskin of the borderer; all mingling togethw, yet scarcely speaking; each retiiing his own purpose and opinion, while he asked without obtaiuing those of his nefgh-. 4     26        TThE SWAMP STEED; OR TIlE DAYS bor; all laboring under a most intense excitement, and ever and anon turn- ing a glance up towards the town hal, in front of'which were drawn up, in lines facing each other, twenty-four mounted troops, who had that morning escorted into town three royal oficers, who were then in earnest conference within the building. The crowd continued to receive fresh accessions as the morning wore along, and the large green facing the town hall began to present a somewhat threa- tening aspect. As yet, however, everything was vague and unsatisfactory. Although it was a generally understood fact that every body had heard the rumor, yet no one could trace it to any reliable source. True, the arrival of the three royal officers and their twenty-four troops on that morning, and that of Richard Winter the night before, were significant; but the latter had not shown them- selves to the people; the sheriff had made no proclamation; and as to Richard Winter, his character was bad and the crowd knew not what amount of credit to place in his statements. And yet it was easy to perceive, by the restless, gloomy and threatening brows of the concourse that they believed, indefinite and thus far unsupport- ed as was the report, implicitly in the startling rumor they had heard, an; were prepared to act upon it the moment it assumed the shape of certainty. Still they would wait, and do nothing prematurely, till the intelligence came to them in such a manner that there could no longer be any room on which to hang a doubt;-thus spoke the prudent. It was dangerous to take a step which might, after all,.be based upon a false rumor-rumor does so much to mislead men, and bring them to ruin and sorrow; thus spoke the very cautious. It could not be possible that the crown would care so little for the people as to hew them down as reported; there was no use in rushing on to danger without knowing what for ,-thus spoke the timid. If the King has dared to do tiis thing, wo to him-wo oh, if we could but learn something reliable I Thus spoke the true and brave. And all united in waiting for in- telligence from a trustworthy channel. At length a horseman was seen in full gallop on the Georgetown road, and approaching the village at full speed. He had scarcely made his appearance, when another came in sight. Both were well mounted, and rode their horses like men familiar with the saddle. As they neared the town, they raised their hats as a signal that they were armed with news of a serious import, on perceiving which, such of the throng as were on horseback, dashed off from the green to meet them. Among the latter, were our two friends, Neil Somers and the hardy wood- man. As the planter came up with the advancing horseman, he recognized in him a gentleman with whom he had formed an intimate acquaintance in Charleston. The recognition was mutual; and after a warm but hasty salutation on both sides, Neil Somers reined up his horse beside that of the new comer, with whom he entered into a terse and rapid conversation. The effect of the stranger's discourse upon the planter was magical. The blood slowly receded from his countenance: his brow gathered into a gloomy frown; his eyes became half closed and flashed sparks of indignant fire; his nostrils swelled and quivered; the mascles around his mouth twitched as if contending with some electric power; his lips closed in against his teeth as if striving to drive them from their gums; his whole frame shook with a convulsive tremor. But this was only temporary. In a few minutes, by a violent effort of his will, the planter threw off these visible signs of agitation. His face became flushed, his brow unruffled, his eyes expanded, his nostrils calm, his muscles tranquil, and hi. frame composed.   OF MAtIDON AND IrIS RMi rLY ILEN.       27 FE ANow," said the stranger to him in a low voice, "now, Somers, that you know all, tell it to thse nlen upon the green, in your own peculiar style. Speak to them, as you alone know how to speak --appeal to their heads and hearts-and leave the rest to Him!" The voice of the stranger was calm but impressive; and his general air that of one who under stood manklind and himself. As he finished speaking, the planter grasped his hand, pressed it, and exclaimed- t "I will, Marion, I will. I'll speak to them in the name of God and hu- i -  m anity !"               - The straner returned the pressure, and they rode forward in silence to the green. a, they approached, all eyes were bent upon them; and l "'Tis Marion, the Hero of the Forlorn Hope at the batttle of Etchoe l' whispered one, flinging a quiet glance at the stranger. "'Tis Marion, the Friend of the People," said another. "Tis Marion, the rice planter of St. John's," cried a third. "'Tis Marion, the Protector of the Borders," added a fifth. "'Tis Marion, the Thinker," said a sixth. . "'Tis Marion, the Fearless," said another. "'Tis Marion, the True," added an eighth. Wherever he goes, there I will go," said one. "If he sides with the king, then the king must be right, and I will sidoe with him also," murured another. "Marion sides only with the cause of right and truth," returned his neigh- bor; "and the side he takes, that side will be mine." "Hush " whispered all. "We are going to hear it, now. Marion and ' 3   '  s K 8 at with him?" askei a seti'er at his aide "That's Pete torry who four the red skins so stout at the battle of young Somerso are on the stand."  "Yes, it's comin' now. Young Somers is goin' to speakv," "Somers and Marion, are two of the best men in the colony" whispered a middle aged farmer-to another at his elbow; what they say, we can rely on." In There's big Nat, the scalp hunter 1" muttered one. You might be sidure he'd p be on hand when there'sadily recognized be had and given. He's a trump!" Who    part othat with him?" asked a settler at his side "That's Pete Horry, who fout the red skins so stout at -the battle of Etchoe. Theres griat in him, I tell you "e ush -Mrigton and young Sters are whispfarite mng " "  We'll have it soon!" "Yes, it's comin' now. Young Somers is goin' to speak!" The platform was a hastily constructed affair, consisting of a few rough boards laid across the tops of a couple of market wagons resting i the  shadow of a large tree which rose in the middle of the green. In the centre of this staging Somers now  appeared, starding beside the personage who was so readily recognized by the crowd. t he sides, and in fact every part of the platform, was crowded with young and full grown individuals, who had hastily clambered up and seated themselves the moment it was known that it was to be occupied as a rostrum from which to address the multitude. caledOn the right of the sandon the back of his favorite mare with his long rifle lying across the saddle before him, rose the gigantic formr of Nat the woodsman ; his bronzed face turned with eager attention towards the centre of the platform, and his large dare-devil eyes wandering alternately from the face of the planter to that of the gentleman from St. John's, with nervous anxiety. Beside him, and on horseback was the second horseman, whom many of the crowd had alr ady recognized as a good man and true and called by the namer of Horry            a Around the platform, and nearly covaring the entire face of ae green  ,      28        TI SWAMP STEED3; OR THE DAYS stood a vast multitude, consisting of backwoodsmen, farmers, planters, plough- men, laborers, storekeepers, and craftsmen of every kind; all more or less- armed with offensive weapons, and all presenting one of those heterogenous crowds visible only on critical occasions, or when States are in danger. From the windows of almost every house surrounding the green, female heads of all, ages and colors, might be seen looking forth; some glancing ing over the multitude: others straining their eyes in the direction of the platform, and striving with all their might to catch the outlines of the two countenances on whom the gaze of the vast throng was fixed. The limbs of the large tree in the centre of the green were filled with a score or more of men and lads, looking dowpu with anxious interest at the parties on the platform; while, grasping the slightly lening trk, might be seen numbers of others, eagerly and actively working their way up to perch themselves upon the branches; from whence they could look down and hear all that was said, and observe all that was going on. At length the gentleman from St. John's waved his hand as a signal that his companion was about to speak. In a moment the loud murmur formed by the united whisperings and mutterings of the throng ceased, and all eyes were directed at the planter. "Men of Carolina," he began, in a voice that fell on their ears like the clear, bold voice of a clarion, "the hour has come when we must shake off fdrever the cloud which has been hovering over our colonies, and 1ook for a purer sky ; the hour when we must throw off the garments of bondage, and put on the robes of freemen; the hour when we must cease to kiss the hand that smites us, and holding up our heads, return the blow; the hour when we must no longer speak to tyranny by soft petitions and cold words, but by loud cries and hot blood ; the hour when we must no longer welcome the '   minions of oppression, ,but repel and drive them back;i the hour when we must rise, as one man, in the name of that God in whom alone we can trust, and in the name of that suffering humanity of which we are a part, and re- nounce forever the name of Englishmen, and take up that of Americans-fol O, men of Carolina, the royal cannon has been loaded and discharged, the royal muskets have been levelled and their triggers pulled, the royal sword has been lifted and brought down, and hundreds of our brethren butchered in blood I "Do you hear it, men of the borders and the wilderness and not grasp your rifles and yur knives? Do you hear it, tillers of the field, and not catch up your sickles and your scythes? Do you hear it, smiths and howers, and not seize your axes and your bars?

"Woe, woe!" continued the planter, solemnly, as the deafening din was borne away on the aerial waves, woe to the despot who, in reddening our plains with the blood of our people, has brought us to this I '; Woe to the tyrant who has made light of our sufferings, who has lashed us to madness, who has aroused us to vrath! "Woe, woe to the monarch who has called up'our anger, who has pro- voked us to blood, by his slaughter and flame!" I  "Woe, woe!" shouted the multitude, brandishing their weapons, like men ready and eager for battle. "Woe, woe to. the ingrate who has grown strong, haughty and rich on our substance, and returns it with fire, returns it with blood!" " oe, woe 1" repeated the throng. "Woe, woe to the moniarch, woe to his minions, should they come on our borders, should they tread on our valleys, should they appear on our hills!" "Woe, woe " yelled the multitude, frantic with rage. "(For they have slaughtered our brethren, have chased them with bullet and cannon and steel, and fired their homesteads and laid waste their 'field, Woe, woe to them, woe!"     30        THE SWAMP STEED ; OR TTE' DAYS  And again, with countenances dctakened with rage, the throng flornishea their weapons and yelled aloud, "Woe, woe!" "For the blood they have spilled, they shall give blood in return!" "Aye-aye-blood in return!" "For every life they have taken, they shall pay it with five!" "With five!" "For every hearthstone they have broken, they shall do penance in blood 1" ' Do penance in blood!" "Till the last legion is broken and prostrate and slain; till the last vessel that brought them lies a wreck on the ocean, without captain or crew; till the last vestige of kingcraft lies smouldering in ashes, reposing in death!" Smouldering in ashes, reposing in death 1" "' Thus shall we destroy the despot's power to do us harm, thus dash aside for ever the bitter chalice from which he would compel us drink; thus shall we pass from danger unto safety; thus climb from bondage up to freedom; thus stride from misery to happiness; thus stalk from weakness and decay to strength, security and progress; thus pass from the vassalage of bondsmen to the independence of freemen; thus climb from poverty and darkness, to prosperity and light; thus pass from slavery, danger and misrule, to fieedom,. security and order!" "Freedom, security and order " * And with these words, there rose up from the multitude on the green, a shout that made the welkin ring and reverberate like echoes of thunder amid wild and cavernous hills. "Thus," continued the planter, his countenance beaming with a radiance and grandeur which gave him an air of such sublime majesty that the majo- rity of his hearers never forgot it to their dying day, and which impressed many of them with the conviction that the words which followed were the offspring of prophetic inspiration, " thus on the ruins of a cruel, selfish and ungrateful despotism, shall we erect the structure of a free, liberal and flour- ishing republic; thus shall we teach a lesson to kings they will remember to their latest hour; thus shall we make of these colonies and this whole conti- nent a gigantic republic which shall open its broad arms to the weak and oppressed of all climes, and by the force of its moral and physical strength dictate humanity to the kinglings and despots of the earth I "Thus, O men of Carolina, shall we serve ourselves, humanity and God! Thus, by one brave effort, shall we shake off the fangs of a monster who re- gards us but as vassals whom he is privileged to abuse, ruin and destroy ac- cording to his humor I Let all who love freedom and abhor tyranny, follow me; let all who would emerge from misery to happiness strike a freeman's blow with me; let all who shudder at this brutal murder of our brethren at the North-all who have in their breasts true and gallant hearts, enlist with rr) in the cause of freedom and humanity! "Beside me," pointing to the gentleman from St. Johns, "stands one whom many of you know. You have seen him in the roar and smoke and brunt of battle, and know him for a soldier. You have been familiar for years with his fame as a calm and upright citizen, and know him for a man. ' He is now fresh from Charleston, with authority from the patriot leaders to raise men for a campaign against the -royal cohorts who have shed Ame - ican blood. "In this glorious cause are enlisted the best and bravest' of Carolina's sons; men and arms are waiting-men of Carolina, will ye join our ranks?

For a moment the throng, spell-bound by his words, was silent and motionless. Then drawing a long breath, the mass uttered n low murmur as if striving to find a vent for the feeling that oppressed it. A mo- ment more, and it rocked to and fro like a moving sea; then, as if it had succeeded in shaking off the trance in which it had been wrapt, the murmur was followed by a loud roar which shook the air like a dischalrge of thunder. f    oThis had scarcely passed away when a confused and Ger rush was made for the stand.     "Mr. Somers! put my name down thar', jest onderneath yourn!" cried a voice, which was at once recognized by the crowd. "Hurrah for Nat, the scalp hunter!" cried the multitude, with enthusiasm "And here's a name will follow that!" cried a tall, gaunt young fellow, f mth a rollicking eye and hair of a fiery red, who now sprang upon the plat- form, and seizing the pen dashed off in a clear bold hand, a name afternwards rendered immortal. It was that of?ohn Macdonald. "Hold on, Jack!" cried a young farmer with a pale complexion, an eye black and piercing as an eagle's, short black hair, and a frame slender as a woman's, but supple and muscular as steel; "you can write, and I can't Just put my name down there will you?" !"All right, Bill," answered Macdonald, "there it is, in as saucy a land as a schoolmaster could make it." And he wrote in large, bold hearacters a name that was subsequently destined to attain a high place on the scroll of American fame. That name was William Jasper. ," Hello, captin!," shouted in a loud nasal twang, a personage, dressed in a' rough hunting shirt, and a slouched beaver, whose gigantic lheight, bold pro- file, and lean, gaunt figure, pronounced him one of the " dangerous custom- ers" so common among the colonists of that day, "I've an idea my pot hooks wouldn't look any wuss 'en anybody's else, an 'so I'll skretch 'em down!" And elbowing his way through the throng by whom he was surrounded, and who readily yielded a passage to the sharp elbows of the colossus, the speaker worked his way to the tide of the platform up which le at once clambered with all the agility of a squirrel Taking the pen, he, after numerous contortions, both of body and face, at length succeedejin writing off in letters gaunt and lean as his own power- ful frame, the name of Peter Snipes. The work went on, till the roll of the gentleman from St. Johns was filled, and he declared there were as many upon the paper as were necessary to form his company. The throng looked sad and disappointed. Scores stood around the plat- forti anxious to enrol their names, whom the pressure had till then kept back. "have a friend here," said Marion, readily comprehending their feelings, upon the same errand as myself. We are both attached to the same regi- ment. It will be all the same, if you enlist under him. Captain Torry," he added, turning to that gentleman, "you are wanted here!" The announcement of the gentleman from  St. Johns was received with loud acclamations, amid which captain Horry dismounted fron his' horse, aiii sprang upon the platform, and opening his enlistment roll, declared himself ready to receive the names of those desirous of responding to the call of their country. The bystanders stepped up with an alacrity that was cheering; and while the good work was going on, the gentleman from St. Johns and the young planter occupied one corner of the platform; the former deliber- ately'inspecting one by one the names upon his list, and ever and anon ques- tioning his companion relative to their characters for probity, intelligence and courage; and the latter answering with a readiness which evinced a thorough o           auswc    ne hrog i      32  .      mH S 5WAS P STEIED; OR THE DAYS knowledge of,the habits, attributes and positions of the men of that district, together with an enlarged and correct view of human nature. While they were thus engaged, Nat the woodsman glided quietly from his horse, and' throwing his arm through the rein, bunched his hands over the mouth of his rifle, on which he rested his chin, and then flung his eyes, thoughtfully at the gentleman from St. Johns, to take a good long look at his future commander. The appearance of Captain Maiion was, to the eyes of the scalp hunter, who was accustomed in a great measure to read men's characters by their external aspect, a fit subject for study. In person, he was short and slender; rather below, than on a level with, the common height. His limbs were .small, well set, muscular and wiry, and evidently inured to, and as capable of enduring, the most severe fatigues. In manner, the gentleman from St. Johns was frank, easy, graceful and ubdued. His complexion was of that bronzed hue peculiar to the hardy sons of th- wilderness and the borders. His brows were shaded by masses of thick, jet-black hair; his forehead was broad, high and smooth; his nose small and aquiline; his lips diminutive, but expressive of great strength of will; his chin bold, but softly and deli- cately rounded at the point. But it was in his eyes that the character of the man was most distinctly visible. They were large, the pupils unusually clear and liquidious, and piercing as an eagle's; evincive of a free and unclouded intellect, great depth -of brain, extraordinary powers of penetration, a tranquil spirit, and an un- bending will. These were their prevailing aspect; but at present, while wandering from the enlistment roll to the planter, in quest of intelligence, they presented another phase, viz: that of obtaining information and quietly storing it away; and they appeared as if perpetually engaged in thus collect- ing and laying by items of value which they could call up for use and refer- ence at a future day. "He'll du 1" muttered the scalp hunter to himself; as he completed his sur- vey of his future commander. '"The metal's in him; the geenyus is in his head, the grit is in his muscles. How quietly he draws everything from Neil; sounds him to the bottom without disturbin' himself, or lettin' a crit- ter know what he's up tu! He'll du! Ef he lives he'll giv;e the Britishers some tetches of thunder, with a small sprinklin' of lightnin'. The geenyus is in his head, and the grit in his muscles. He's got a nice set of boys tu, tu work with. There's that Jack M:cdonald, a critter that could take the hide off a painter in a fair fight in less time than a yaller belly could whittle off a scalp. And then there's Bill Jasper, who, ef he aint got much larnin', knows an awful lot of hewman natur, and ken whip his weight in wild cats. As to Pete Snipe, I've seen him tackle a dozen redskins at a lick, without a-finger of powder or a single lead drop, and cave 'em as ef they'd bin corn shucks. As fur Tom Newton, and the rest of the cumpany, I don't know sech a darn sight about 'em, but they look as of they wouldn't turn tail for any Britisher ' or yaller belly in the eol ny, and I've a notion that in that respeck they don't look fur out 'er the way!" At this moment, the attention of the scalp hunter was drawn from the platform to the crowd, which was now making demonstrations of a turbulent character. In another instant he heard a cry- "Look out! the sheriff is comin' down on us!" This was speedily followed by another- "The varmint is in the middle of the troops. Look to your locks, boys the troops are comin'!" "Shoot the villains! fire boys, fire!" "Stay!" cried a calm, authoritative voice from the stand. It was that oi   OF IATION ANsD IS DIE RtIY IEN.    *     33 Marion, on whom all eyes were in an instant turned. "Stay, if ye are men I Let's not sully the sacred cause in which we are engaged by a single cowards ly act. Until these men proclaim themselves foes, it is our duty to regard them as friends. Let the sheriff speak-it is his right as a public officer! touch not his supporters-they are but fulfilling a duty in guarding him Should they lead the htay in violence, their blood be on their own heads!" The throng became sullenly silent, and fell back-their countenances how- ever exhibiting a rebellious spirit, and their eyes glaring maliciously at the royal officers and troops. The sheriff and his posse advanced down the high road skirting the green  upon reaching the centre of which they turned their horses' heads and i guided them in the direction of the tree, between which and themselves rose a compact mass of armed, stern-browed men, grasping their arms firm- ly and huiling at them glances sullen and flashing with indignant fire. The troops paid but little attention to those threatening demonstrations, and at a "Forward!" from one of their officers, gently spurred up their steeds, a supercilious smile lighting up their features the while, expecting the crowd to fall back and give them a free passage, out of that instinctive fear and respect for the king s troops which they had so long been accustomed to witness among the people. But not a man moved, not a brow unlocked its threatening frown, not an eye relaxed its fierceness. "Forwardl" cried the leading officer, in a loud, determined voice, and throwing at the same time an angry glance at his mei. "Forward!" he re- peated, jerking his rein, and plurfging his spurs violently into the sides of. his steed. The animal bounded forward suddenly toward the crowd, followed by the remaining officers and troops. At this moment,. a hundred rifles were raised and sighted, the sudden movement of which frightened the animals, and threw  them on their haunches. "Charge!" cried the officer, rising in his stirrups, and hurling a fierce glance upon the crowd. "Fall backl" exclaimed a loud, ringing voice, which was recognised by nearly every ear as that of the most intrepid dare-devil of all Williamsburgh, viz: Jack Macdonald. "Fall back, I warn you  Another step-another movement, and a hundred rifles shall empty your saddles in an instant I Do you think to ride us down, as if we were cattle?" The officer trembled, and turned his eye appealingly to the sheriff, who now appeared in the centre of the two lines of troopers, and between two young officers, whose handsome features and striking resemblance to one, an- other were matters of profound astonishment and remark. At this moment, Nat, the woodsman, turned his head in the direction of the platform, and his eyes met those of the young planter, who was pale and trembling. "He has recognised-'em!" murmured the scalp hunter. The sheriff now rode forward, and raising himself in his stirrups, ex- claimed--              r "In the name of the king, I charge ye to open a passage for the royal troops. Do you hear?" he added, angrily; as he noticed the indifference with 'which t:s order was received, "in the name of fie 'king " The crowd remained firm; not a movement was visible, except in the ranks of the troops, which now, at a signal from the officer, calmly drew their weapons from their sheaths. "Stayl" said the sheriff, with an agitation he tried in vain to repress. "'Let me once more appeal to these misguided men, who surely cannot dream of opposing the servants of His Majesty I Citizens," he added, turn- 5     34 ,      TrHE SWAMP STEED; on THE DAYS mng to the multitude, "I command ye, in the name of the king, to disperse, and return to your homes. He who refuses to obey this order, I, by virtue of my office as sheriff of the county, hereby pronounce a traitor and an out- law. Citizens, disperse, in the name of the king!" The throng remained stationary; not a man moved. Big beads of sweat gathered upon the brow of the sheriff. "Citizens," he cried, "you do not, it appears, comprehend me. I have ordered you to disperse, and you do not seemI disposed to obey. I fear there are traitors among you; men of bad hearts and evil minds, whose serpent tonmgues have beguiled you of your better judgments, and are leading you astray. But beware how you trife with the servants of the king; be cau- tious how you tamper with. the crown! I feel disposed to pity your weak minds, and to overlook your great crime in refusing to obey my order, but. only on one condition." He paused, as if expecting some reply; but receiving none, he resumed, in a voice thick with emotion- "But it is only on one condition that, in the name of the king, I will over- look your great act of treason, in refuising to comply with the order wich, as a servant of the crown I have given." He paused again, and threw his eyes over the multitude, with an expres- sion of great synmpathly. "And this condition is, that every good and loyal subject of his majesty, King George, shall instantly leave this green and walk out into the high road. This will enable me to distinguish who are for open and avowed trea- son, and who for the King!" And with these words, the sheriff resumed his seat in the saddle, and smiled complacently as if in expectation of beholding the mass break in a thousand fragments, and scatter and re-collect out upon the road. What then, was his amazement, after the lapse of nearly half a minute, to discover that of the throng not a man had moved, and that the highway was as void of their presence as before I He rubbed his eyes, and looked around him wildly, like a man who feared to place credit m the evidence of his idinding tnen, that his eyes had not betrayed him, that the multitude re- garded his offer in the same light with which they had treated his order, that is, with indifference and contempt, the-sheriff threw off the mock expression of sympathy he had assumed, and turned, with a countenance blazing with wrath, to the captain of horse. "Disperse the knaves!" he cried, "ride trample, cut them down, sir, in the name of the king!" "Form in line 1" said the officer, turning to his men. "Unsling your carbines-make ready, present--- ." Before he could complete his sentence, half a dozen sharp rifle reports cracked on the air: the officer and sheriff reeled to and fro for an instant, and then dropped from their saddles, without a sigh, without a groan I This significant demonstration operated on the troops like a charm. Their carbines dropped from their hands as if they had been bars of fiery iron. The two young officers alone, of all the troupe, retained their courage and self-possession. They exchanged a few hasty words, and then rode up in front of their comrades, divided them into two divisions of twelve men each, and then filed off into the high road, for the purpose, as the throng supposed, of taking leave of the town altogether. But in this the multitude on the green were mistaken. The young offi- cers entertained no such idea. On the contrary, they looked upon this as one of those chances in the life of a soldier, when fame, fortune and immor- tality, are won by a single bright thought, a single gallant deed; and they determined to take advantage of the opportunity.   OF MARION AND I1 RIIElLRRY MiE.       35 On reaching the high load, then, each ordered his division into line, and prepared for battle. "My God!" cried a voice upon the platform, which summoned Marion to the side of the speaker. "Somers-Somers!" said he in a tone of commiseration, "are you ill!" "Look there!" answered the planter, with a groan, and he pointed to the officers. "They are preparing to attack us!" "But you surely do not fear them?" said Marion, not comprehending him. St   "Fear? Yes-I tremble, not for myself, but my mother. 1ecr heart will break, should she learn it!" And the young man appeared as if about to die. "My friend," said Marion, with an air of perplexity, "I fear you have taken leave of your senses." "No, no i not that-not that 1" exclaimed the planter, in a voice of such agony that it seemed as if his heart were being wrenched from him by sorme invisible demon. "You do not understand me, and this is not a time for explanation 1" As he spoke, his eyes fell upon his horse, which stood between the Sfacfoll and the tree. "ia!" he cried, a sudden ray, as if of inspiration lighting up his features. "I am saved-she is saved God of heaven, I thank thee!" In an instant le was upon his horse, and driving through the crowd, who, deeming him mad, rapidly opened for him a passage, through which he sped like lightning. The planter's cry was heard and his movements witnessed by the scalp hunter, who no sooner beheld him spring into the saddle, and plunge through the multitude, than' he at once comprehended his idea, and his object as well, "He cannot du it alone " he murmured. "It takes two to kerry thru a scheme like that! ' Give way, friends," he cried aloud, "I want a passage tu l"             I So saying, he bent down and whispered in the ear of his mare, "Now Nell-now, old gall" The next instanthe was flying through the crowd as if a legion of Indians were on his trail. In a moment more he was on the road, and beside the planter. "I und'stand yer plan, Neil," he said hurrriedly, " which one air yew goin' to ketch?" "The one on the left," answered the other. "I und'stand," answered the woodsman, and he careened over to the di- vision on the right. : Take care, your honor," said a trooper to his commander, " here's one of the traitors coming up." He had scarcely uttered the warning, when the woodsman glided up, and passing his long, powerful arm around the officer'swaist, lifted him from his saddle, and placed him before himself on his horse. "Now, Nell-now old gal " and away flew the mare with her double burden back to the green. "S Give way friends, give way!" cried the woodsman. And his gallant mare dashed through the amazed crowd, never halting till she reached the stand, where she was joined, a few moments later, by the swamp steed, whose back was also freighted by a dopble burden. So sudden and daring had been the whole movement, the soldiers could scarcely credit it as real. As to the two young officers, they were bewilder- ed; as to the gentleman from St. John's, he was stupified. And the multi- tude upon the green, taking it simply for a brilliant stroke of genius, rent the air with deafening hurrahs of admiration and delight. "You are my prisoner," said the planter, in as calm a voice as he could     36        THE SWAMP 8rEED; oR THE DAYS assume, to the officer he had captured. "Blood has been shed, and you will consider it as an evidence that I am sincere, when I tell you, your life is not worth a pin's fee, if you make an effort to escape. Your sword!" "You have the courage of a soldier, and the air of a gentleman," replied the officer, "and I feel confident that my blade, which has never vet been tainted by dishonor, will, with its master, find honorable treatment at your hands." As he finished, he drew theweapon from its sheath, and taling it by the blade he presented the handle to the planter, who received it withi an air of grace and diguity which called forth a murmur of admiration from the crowd. "Yours," he continued, turning' to the other officer; "nay," he added, as the prisoner turned inquiringly to the scalp hunter, who replied to his glance by a nod of approval, "I ask it of you in his name, and that -of your brother -fiorm whom you would, doubtless, not desire to be separated?'" "O1, o l" answered the prisoner, taking his kinsman by the hand. A"r. Akarmnan, continued the planter, "you will give me your prisoner, will you not, in order that they may not be parted?" "He was yourn from, the moment he was taken," answered the woodsman. "I knew it, or I had had not spoken," said the planter, with a smile of gratitude. "You will therefore perceive, sir," he added, to the officer, "the propriety of yielding up your sword to me-to me, who, as your conqueror, cannot permit you to retain it." The officer no longer hesitated. "Your words of honor now, gentlemen, as soldiers," continued the plant- er, " that neither of you will attempt to escape," The officer drew themselves up. "I ask it of you, as gentlemen," continued the planter, with an air of such supreme dignity and grandeur, that the officers intuitively recognized in him a being far superior to themselves, " that I may not be compelled to wound your delicacy, by treating you like men who would violate their honor!" "I give it to you, sir," said the first. "And I," added the second. And in the voice and air of the planter, so replete with all the elements of true gentility, the brothers felt an innate influence, magnetic in its tone and effect, gliding like drops of mercury through their organizations, and subdu- ing them to a sense of their inferiority, which they could neither define nor resist. "One thing more, gentlemen," said the planter. "Your troops must lay down their arms, and retire from this county. Oblige me by returning to the road, and giving them the order." "Nay," said the first officer, "you are now asking-too much. I cannot do that. It would cover them and myself with dishonor. They do not regard themselves as your prisoners 1" "But they soon will be; or what is worse, dead I Reflect. They are in a hostile attitude to five hundred men, three hundred of whom have rifles in their hands, each charged with a messenger that kills wherever it strikes. These men arc unerring marksmen, too, and impatient to test their skill upon your troops, whom they regard as foes. Reflect, sir-reflect!" I have reflected, sir l" answered the young man, haughtily. "Reflect again! The passions of this multitude are aroused; their hearts incensed against a monarch who has shed the blood of their brethren: and your troops wear the livery of that kinp!" "You have had my answer, sir!" "ALt I ask you to reconsider it. It is to spare the lives of your troops that I ask you to do this.

"E"noulEolh, sir!" retiurned the officer, "I am ready to accede to your wish."  "    '-l' 'Tis well, sir. T w-ll not insult yourl honor as a gentleman by accompany- -,    bing yon. Take my hOrse.

"A passatge there. ftiendls!" cried the planter to the crowd; "and let no man insult this gentleman. He is my friend!" The packed mass divided, and the officer passed slowly off the green, and approached the troops.'  "Comrades!" he cried, "resistance is useless. We are in the hands of men who linow their power and are prepared to use it. My brother and I are prisoners, but you are free to return to Charleston when you have laid dclown your guns. Spare me the pain of giving you that order, but believe me when I tell you that it is necessary if you would not lose your lives!" In a moment every man had unslung his carbine and dropped it upon the earth. "I thank you gentlemen," continued the officer, " for this manifestation of your confidence. And now comrades, farewellI I need not tell you what report you had best make on reaching Charleston. Farewell!" The troops raised their caps in token of adieu; then forming into four lines of six men eachthey dashed ofl; and were in a few minutes out of sight. The officer looked after them till they had disappeared; then wheeling his horse about, and uttering a deep sigh, he rode slowly back to the platform in the green. CHAPTER V.  AT one of the two white curtained windows of a small parlor on the second floor of the Palmetto, an inn of some pretensions to respectability standing on the roadside, and commanding a fine view of the village of K;ilgstree, as well as of the surrounding country, were two young" men whose eyes were watching, with an expression of deep interest, the proceed- ings upon the green. They were neatly and tastily dressed in the quaint costume of that period, and their general air pronounced them members of the petty aristocracy which had risen even in that day among the inhabitants of the borders. The one was rather foppish and effeminate in. his manner; the other; thougl evidently not less proud, was yet more manly in his appearance. Both had the Saxon blue eye, light hair and faiw complexion which marked the English families of the province; as the black hair. dark eyes and olive tinge designated those of the French; and as the sandy locks, gray eyes and f r esh cheeks announced those of the Scotch; all of which races were very noerally represented among the borderers of that section of the colony.     38        TIS SWAMP STuEE:D , OR THE DAYS Tbey are carrying matters with a high hand, Crampion," observed Lhe plainest of the two to his companion, as the sheriff and officer fell from their horses; "but there will be an hour of reckoning for all this: and when it comes, yon hero of to-day," and he pointed to Neil Somers, "will swing for his frothy bravado, and take his last look of earth in the court-yard' of the provost!" "It certainly is horwible, Wintah," answered the other drawlingly. "Hadn't we bettar go away from heeah? It is pausitively dangerous!" Nonsense!" said the other, contemptuously. "Wlhat have we to fear?" "Everything. If those fellows should fire a little. too higlh and a ball should come this way, the consequences would be horwible! And then' what would my mother say?" "Time enough to fear when there is a prospect of danger. Why do you tremble so? For shame, man! Bring back the blood to your cheeks, and calm your nerves, or I shall be compelled to think you are a coward!" "O, come now, Wintab, none of your dem'd horwible jokes-I can'l. see the force of them. They are pausitively personal and excruciatingly out- ridgeous. What would my mother say?" "Nonsense, Crampton!" answered the other in a milder tone, "I have no intention of offending you. I speak as a brother would to a brother, and not as a man to a stranger. But you are' really too much of a woman in your ways, and too little of a man. Drop your effeminacy, as you love me. Think you my sister can admire in you what she detests in another? If so, undeceive yourself: Consider whom you have for a rival!" And he pointed, as he spoke, to the tall, manly, dignified form of the plan- ter upon the platform on the green. "Pausitively, Wintah, you have a dem'd, horwible way of expwessing yourself!' exclaimed the exquisite. "I shall be compelled to get angwy with you 1" "Nonsense, Crampton! I am a plain spoken man; ain I speak plainly, because the case demands it. But I warn you, I can never do anything for you with Amy, unless you throw off your foppery. Women are fond of men of masculine temperaments, because they are in- such powerful contrast with their own effeminate natures. Look at Neil Somers, now; there is hardly a woman in all Williamsburg who would not give her chances of l6aven to win him. And yet he is not handsomer than you, nor a twentieth part so rich. Imitate him, Crampton, if you would succeed'with my sister: for I warn you, you will have to bring other qualifications than those of an accom- plished ladies' man, into requisition, to win the heart of Amy, whom this planter has already fascinated." The exquisite drew back, and turning to a mirror that was suspended from the wall between the windows, examined himself with an air of super- cilious satisfaction. "I am vewy much obliged to you, Wintah," he said, running his jewelled fingers through his curled locks, " but I am vewy well satisfied with myself and have no ideeah of copying anybody." "As you please," answered the other, with a quiet sneer, " but if you fail in winning Amy, forget not that I pointed out to you in the beginning the only way in which you could succeed." "But such a widiculous model as you give me, Wichard-a petty plantah, a fellow who associates with common people, and is seldom seen in wespecta- ble society. What would my mother say?" "Your mother has sppilod you, Crampton; or you would appreciate the qualifications of a man like Somers, who is not more of a favorite with wo- men, than he is popular among men. I tell you, Crampton, he is a rival worthy of your highest consideration. Look at him now, as he dashes from jf..   8I; 8;OiF IC)o MAMON AND HS MERRY MEN.                39 green on his spirited charger, followed by yon gigantic woodsman. To tthe window, man--quick! What has he in view now? As I live-look 1" He caught his companion suddenly by the wrist with his left hand, and with the other pointed energetically to the planter, who had at that instant lifted the young officer from his horse, and transferred him to his own, as we have already described it in the preceding chapter. "Look, Crampton, look! By the living God they have captured the twin brothers, in the very face of the troops, and are actually bearing them of prisoners I And there the varlets sit like dumb statues on their steeds, and make no effort to save them I Ho, there I knaves 1" he cried aloud to the troops, "are ye mad I Forward to the rescue!" But the window was closed, a fact which his sudden frenzy had caused him to overlook, and by the time he had made the discovery, the captured officers were on the platform, and beyond the reach of the soldiery. "There!" continued Winter, turning to his companion, " there is another of his feats, and one which will make his name ring with tenfold popularity throughout Williamsburgh. Is he a common rival, think you? Undeceive yourself! I tell you, Crampton, he will shine from this hour with greater brilliancy than ever in Amy's heart. Wake up, man. Throw off your draw. ing-room habits and put on the energies of a man; or, after all, this petty planter' will walk off with my sister!" "No fear of that, Wichard; the fellow will soon be out of the way. Don't you wemembah what you said a little while ago? The pwovost?" Si "But what if they catch him not?" "Oh, Wichard, but they will The officers of the cwown are vewy stout --vewy!" "Not so stout as you think, Crampton." "Oh, yes they are, my deah fellow. You cannot conceive what confi- dence I have in them! They are as stwong as ev-ah." "Does the scene we have just witnessed, look like it?" "Oh, that was merely a tempowawy twiumph of the mob I I am Iprfect ly satisfied with the power' of the cwown, and of my own abilities to rendah myself pleasing to Miss Wintah. Besides, Wichard, you perfectly surpwise me, to hear you talk in this mannaw of that thingamy--what's his name?-the plantah! I weally entertained the idee-ah that you hated him most outridgeously. I did pausitively!" "And you thought right " answered Richard Winter. "Hate him- that's the word; and yet you can see I can do him justice: for all the bitter burning hatred that lies seething in my heart, cannot take away one jot of his popularity, nor cause his aclmowledged merits to diminish a single grain. If it could, think you I would spare him? No; I would' plunge him into such ignominy as would make his proud heart break and wither by slow and torturing inches. I would hurl him into such misery as would make the frightfulest of human agony seem comparative bliss. I would make him lie on a couch of such exquisite anguish, that a bed of slimy, crawling asps would be an Eden to it!" "You surprise me, Wichard! Why this intense enmity?" "/at is my secret I When I have him in my grasp-when he lies broken, bleeding, crushed and ruined-when calamity after calamity shall have driven him to the verge of despair, and but one other woe is wanting to make his cup full and plunge him riven in hope, withered in heart, crushed h soul, over the brink of eternity, then I will stoop and breathe that word in his ear. Till then, "the secret remains here, in this heart, locked tp in the same chamber with my hatred, and there it will remain till the hour shall have come when, in all its fierce and bristling malignity, it can step forth and sweep him from existence." "You are a dweadful fellow Wichard I wouldn't have you for an enemy     40        THE SWtAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS on any account. What would my mother say?. But, now I think of it didn't you seduce Miss Somers? Pausitively that was a shocking affair; she was such a, cllawming cweature. I had sewious intentions at one time of trymig to captivate her myself."  "Ye," answered Ricllharld Winter, : that was my first step in veng-eance. I won her soft heart-broke it-rent it in twain, coolly, calculatingly, pre- meditatedly, as if it were a thread I And when she died, s6 carefully had I taken my measures, there was not a family in the village, scarcely in the Dis- trict, but knew with her death the taint also which like a chaplet of infamy clung to her name I' "You fwighten me, Wichard. You are so dem'd cool in the revelation of your enormities. It is pausitively shocking! I tremble while I look at you. What would my mother say?" "What care I? I amn no boy, to fiet and fume and froth with passion be- cause my! feelings have been outraged, or my pride Wounded. No; I can think calmly on my my injuries, and as calmly avenge them I But see-the mob is breaking up and dispersing; and he-he comes this way with his fiiends and prisoners!" "Hadn't we better go, Wichard? I feel vewy uneasy " "No: let us remain. I have a thought that needs maturing. Thoseoffi- cers are friends of mine; perhaps I can do them a service, and myself a gratification. , Who knows?" And quietly dropping the curtains, he retired from the window to ring up the landlord; but in moving the drapery, an eye in the advancing groUp had caught his person: that eye was the planters. "L andlord," said Richard Winter, as that personage, appeared "dice and a bottle of Moselle. And a word in your ear," he added, "when Somers and his party have made their arrangements about the disposal of the prison ners, come and let me know, will you?" And lhe slipped a piece of gold into the hand of mine host, who returnes a sigftficant wink, and then withdrew. "iWhat my deahfellow," said the exquisite, "shall we play? I'm de- "For the wine, nothing more," answered Richard Winter, carelesly, 'T'm as dry as a panther." Oh no, Wichard-let's make it intewesting. My purse is vewy heavy." "And mine light, Besides, you have too many due bills of mine already  and I cannot consent to borrow any 'more till I have means to pay what  already owe you!" At this moment the' door opened, and the landlord appeared with the wine and dice, which he placed upon a small table in the centre of the room; then making an expressive wink in reply to a quiet glance from Winter he turned and quitted the apartment  "Break the bottle," said Richard Winter, thoughtfully, to his companion. "There!" returned the exqulisite, as e complied witlh the order and filled up the glasses. "Toss it off, Wichard, and dwop your weflections. I never like to see a man too thoughtful; it makles one uneasy. I never wefect!" "Twere well if you did!" muttered Winter to himself. " You would not then be the tool and simpleton I have always found you!" He tossed off his glass, and takingt up the dice box, affected to be exhili- rated by the wine. "Come, Crampton" I e exclaimed, "now then who pays for the Moselle?" And shaking the box, he threw the dice upon the table. "  Ten only ten l" he cried, "I shall be put in for it at this rate 1" And he threw again: making an eight count. "What else could i expect!" he cried, with a light laugih. "Fortune delights in making me step lower and lower, each sucaceding day 1"   OF MARION AND MS M   sivILtY 53N.      41 I    And he threw a third time; and fifteen rose to the surface. g  L   & "Ahl" he added, "the jade is not so bad, after all. Thirty-three would not be bad with any other antagonist; but wiLh you, Crampton, with you who are fortune's choicest pet, such a number is' only equivalent to a de- feat!" "You flattah me!" returned the exquisite, with a condescending smile, as he rattled the box, and threw. "Did I not say so," said Richard Winter, quietly. "Twelve!" "Twelve is a vewy good number," remarked Crampton, with a sparkling eye. "I have evewy confidence in a twelve when it is opposed to a ten  What's this? Fourteen! Why, this is extwicmely delightfull" And rattling the dice a third time, ten made its appearance. I  "That isn't so vewy bad, Wichard; do you think it is? Pausitively, it would give me most excruciating pleashah, to play that way all day. Let's have another!" Richard Winter shook his head. "No," he said, with affected tipsyness, "my noddle won't stand it; whereas you, Crampton, you are as cool as an autumn breeze." This was not exactly the case; in fact, a spectator would have pronounced it exactly the reverse: but the wealthy exquisite, upon whom the Moselle was operating like a charm, to the infinite secret satisfaction of Ilis companion, did not perceive it, and patronizingly exclaimed: "Come now, Wichard, don't wefuse in that nannah. My purse is heavy, and nothing would give me more pleashah than a little quiet play. Be ac- commodating now-LI won't entirely fleece you!" "Well, go on," said Richard Winter, with affected hesital ion. "I have but twenty guineas about me, and might as well lose them!" As he spoke, he threw his purse before him on the table. "You are a good soul, Wichard!" murmured the exquisite, following his example. "Shall we make it interesting, Wichard? Twenty guineas isn't such a very gweat stake!" "As you please, answered Richard Winter, noticing with his usual quiet smile, the effect of the wine upon his companion, who fortified himself every few moments with a fiesh sip of his Moselle. "Rattle away!" "Ei-eight!" cried the exquisite, throwing down the dice. "Eight is-is not so vewy bad!" "Very clever!" muttered Winter. "Seven  That ma-akes fifteen. I haven't such a gweat deal of con-fi- eonfidence in fifteen I Ah-what's that?" "Ten!" said Richard Winter, taking up the dice and rattling the lbox. "Which makes twenty-five. I nevah had a vewy pwodigiois wespect for twenty-fives. I've seen 'em beat l" "No doubt," observed the other as he rattled the box and threw tho dice- upon the table. "Twelve!" "Twelve is a vewy fine numbah, Wiehard. I've heard of figures winning that were nmuch lower than a twelve. What's that?" "Sixteen!"  "Take up the stakes, Wichard. Sixteen is good. But an idc,-ah stv-ikes me. Suppose we double -the pile?"      . "If you desire it, certainly. Go on.; anything to accommodate." So saying he pushed the box across the table.' They resumed their play, and continued it for about an hour, at the end of which time, there was a gentle knock at the door, and the landlord made his appearance. Richard Winter was at that moment clearing up his winnings, having drain- ed his companion of his last guinea.     42       Ti? SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "The parties are going to remain here all nightr whispered the lanm lord. "And the offcers?" said Richard Winter. "Will sleep in the same chamber with Mr. Somers, Marion and the bad woodsman." "Enough! Detain them as long as possible in the morning. I will us every nerve to be here by daybreak with a posse of regulars. That for yol fidelity!" And he threw the man a guinea. "Is the way clear, and our horses ready?" The innkeeper nodded a quiet affirmative. "Thanks. Follow me, Crampton!" And taking the exquisite by the arm, who appeared to lose with the san pleasure that he won, Richard Winter and his companion passed quietly fro: the small parlor and out of the inn, to the stable, where they found the horses in waiting. "There's a crown for you, you rascal 1" exclaimed Richard Winter, to tf black hostler. "And remember, not a word to any one of my appearanm here, or departure!" "I is up, inassa l" returned the negro, with a sly leer. The riders glided quietly out of the yard and turned down the Georgetow road. "Where now, Wichard?" asked the exquisite, with his usual drawL "You had best home!" answered the other. "As for me, I have son hours of hard riding to get through. Further than that I cannot inform yoi Farewell!" And waving his hand,.he dashed down the road. "A vewy clever fellow is Wichardl" murmured the exquisite, lookin after him with a mingled stare of astonishment and admiration; "vew clevab indeed: but exwtemely cwuel in his wesentments. If I were such wicked devil, what would my mother say!" CHAPTER    VI. THE twin brothers, as the reader is already aware, had fallen into the hanc of the planter. Fortune had unexpectedly favored the desires of that gentle man, and granted the prayer which had for some days been rising from h heart to his lips, and from his lips to the throne of grace. Wholly ignorant of the relationship which existed between themselves an the planter, the twin brothers merely regarded their capturer as a gentlema of a noble and superior mind, and as one who would, out of that high respe which he entertained for his own honor, treat them witl the consideratio due to their standing as gentlemen, and the gentlo rigor due to their positio as officers. And as they had seen sufficient in his air and conduct to wai rant the highest confidence in his honor, they felt satisfied to follow hin without any fears as to the result, whithersoever he saw fit to convey then They had also a firm reliance in certain influential friends at Charleston, an felt confident something would be done which would, in a few days, .termi nate their detention and restore them to liberty. With these thoughts, an buoyed up by -lively spirits which ever cluster around the heart of youn manhood, they resigned themselves tranquilly to their position, which the individually regarded as one of the unpleasant, but not uninteresting episode in the life of a soldier.   iOF MA/IL ON AND HS MEPLRRY MEN.        4;3 On reaching the ani, the planter- took Captain Maarion aide, and summarily explained the cause of his interest in thl young officers; which exposition was so perfectly satisfactory to the gentleman from St. Johns, that li at once proffered his assistance to convey them to their destination, which offer was readily and gratefully accepted. "When do you propose starting?" asked Marion, in the same low tone in which the previous exposition had been discussed; " to-morrow morning?" "That was my intention," returned the planter; "but I have since made a discovery which will render it necessary to proceed almost immediately." At this moment the landlord entered the room. "A lunch, host," said the planter; and get it ready soon as possible--we are famished." "Will you honor me with your company for the night, gentlemen? I ask that, in case such should be your desire, I may order the beds ready." "You may get them in readiness, then," returned Somers, wh6 saw in a moment by the hesitating air of the man that something was brewing. "Thank you-thank you l" returned the landlord, bowing almos t to the floor. "The lunch will be here in a few minutes." '"The manl is too obsequious!" muttered' the planter, more and more con- vinced that his suspicions were well founded. "Nat," he added, turning to the scalp hunter, in a whisper. "Well, Neil?" "He is here." "Who?" "Richard Winter! Don't start--the twins are observing us. Bo calm, and believe. I saw him retiring from a window as we approached the inn. 'He is their friend, and in the king's interest. He must be watched." "I kin un'stand the necessity of that." "And therefore, my friend, while you all lunch, I will keep an eye on the lane from the window. If my suspicions are correct, he will soon quit the house; if he does, it will be to return with a force of royalists, to attempt a rescue., "I un'stand," returned the scalp hunter, with a significant wink; "and the unly objection I have tu the hull arrangement is that it will look better fur me tu be at the winder than yew." If you think so, Nat  " "Wall, I du; and with all respeck to yew, Niel, it must be so." "Lunch, gentlemen," said the landlord, who, at this instant, entered the apartment.- "You have a number of guests here, friend l"-said the planter approach- ing him and speaking in a low confidential voice; " is Richard Winter among N-no," stammered the man, who scarcely knew how he ought to reply. "'is well!" observed the planter. "This man has been tampered with- he even lies!" he added tohimself, "I felt convinced something .was at work!" The wine and edibles made an excellent repast, to which all parties did ample justice. During its discussion, the scalp hunter kept watch at the window, and per- mitted nothing to escape him. "I will change places with you now, Nat," said the planter approaching "As you please, Neil. But hadn't somebody better be posted at that winder?" and he pointed to the other end of the apartment. "From there yew ken see intu the stable yard. If the critter has got his horse, which it is more'n likely he has, he'll hev tu go down tha'. " "A good idea, Nat. Captain Marion will you step this way?"     "       THEi SWAt'? StraIsD.; OIL TIIE DAYS That gentleman approached; and upo- matt&rs being explained to him, consented to watch at the rear window. Meanwhile the woodsmansccated himseL' at tale, and attacked the edib with a speed which cvinced his anxiety to get through with it as quickly possible, and a gusto which satisfied the officershe was laying in provisic for many days. He had scarcely finished, when his quick ear detected t sound of footstcps lighitly desdending the staircase, and he cautiously, join Marion at the rear window. In a few moments, he perceived Winter and his companion cross the cor yard, the gate of which was at the same instant quietly opened by the lar lord. "All right!" murmured the scalp hunter. 'They're putty cunnin', I not quite so much so as they might be!" The horses with their riders now moved slowly from the yard; and t scalp hunter, tapping the gentleman from St.' John's significantly on t arm, movedl across the apartment to where the planter was stationed. Their eyes met, significantly, and Somers whispered- "He is off for assistance. We'll give him twenty minutes' start, and th be in our saddles. I'll down and see the landlord; you, Nat, look to 1 horses, and you, my friend," turning to Marion, "attend to the officers, a notify them of our sudden intention to proceed." In a few minutes everything was prepared, and at the time appointed tlh took leave of the inn and the village, leaving the landlord in a state of sl pifaction. "Cuss 'cm!" he exclaimed. "Winter will swear I knew of their intend departure, and purposely deceived him 1" The planter rode ahead; the twin brothers followed; Marion and the so hunter brought up the rear. They rode hard, for night was at hand, anc was necessary to reach their destination before darkness should set in. They took a by-road skirting the Black River, and, keeping out of obs vation as much as possible, plied whip and spur till they were entirely out sight of the village. Then taking the beach, they swam their horses acr the stream, and reached the opposite shore. "Gentlemen," said the planter, turning to the officers, who began to d play signs of impatience and fatigue, "don't retard our journey by murm ing or holding back. We have yet a long ride before us; and unless , prefer the dangers of a night in the woods and swamps, to an early bed  a pleasant repast, you had better follow our example and give your hor a free rein 1" This was sufficient to silence the discontented mutterings of the twin bro ers, who uttered fot another word till they reached their destination. The planter took the shortest route with which he was familiar, and in  time they reached the banks of the Santee. Here, taking a flat boat, they were ferried across to the opposite shore, a the planter cautiously led the way up a gradually rising hill, for twilight 1 now fallen, and the timber and brushwood around them shut out to a corn erable degree the little light that was left, rendering the ascent annoying  their progress very slow. They reached at length the top of the hill, and then slowly journeyed through the timber for about a hundred yards, when they suddenly cnte a small clearing, about thirty acres in extent, at the extremity of which, s rounded by a paling of rough saplings, stood a small, neat lodge, to whic rich stream of silver, hurled on it by the moon, gave the appearance c palace in the wilderness.                  ' "Gentlemen," said the planter, " we have reached our destination." And he struck into a path leading to the lodge, followed by his comp   OF MTARION AND 15IS MERRY MEN.        45 ions, who, it must be confessed, were sufficiently fatigued to tlank their starg for bringing them to, their journcy's end. The planter dismounted on reaching the paling, and knocked loudly at the cottage door. A few moments afterward, a voice was heard witin. "Who's there?" "Friends I" "What friends ?" "Friends from Charleston," answered the planter, in what appeared to his companions preconcerted words. "In a moment," was the reply in a hurried tone; and tle next instant the door of the lodge was throw;n open, and a young man lialf dressed ap- peared upon tho thlneshold. "You are here, then," said he, in a tone of respectful surprise ; "I did not look for you so soon. Are they with you ?" he added in a low wlhisper, "Yes. Is everything prepared ? " "Everything." "You are sure of that ?" "I am, and I 1 stand to it." "Get lights, then, and a repast. We hanve ridden a long distance, and are well nigh famished. Wake Mingo, and bid him look to the horses." The young man bowed respectfully, then turned on his heel and disap- peared in the darkness of the cottage. "Gentlemen," said the planter to his companions, " dismount. A servant will attend to your animals." All parties were, shortly, seated at a rude, but well furnished table, from which, their meal once despatched, they arose considerably refreshed. "The hour now?" asked the planter. "It is on the point of twelve," answered the gentleman from St. John's, consulting a pocket chronometer. "So late? How time flies! Thanking you for your assistance in the mat- ter which brought us hither, I commend you to your beds. Ned," he adled turning to the young man who had charge of the cottage " show these gen- tlemen to their resting place. Good night, sirs I" he added in response to the adieus of the woodsman and captain Marion, who, now, preceded by Ned, retired from the apartment; "Gentlemen," continued the planter, turning to the officers, "if you areo sufficiently refreshed by your repast, and not over desirous as yet of sleep, I would like a few minutes of your society in the open air." "We are ready to follow you, sir." " Thank you-thank you. This way, then !' And the planter led the way out of the lodge to a small green patch in the clearing, situated some thirty or forty yards firom the cottage. "Gentlemen," said the planter, "sit down here with me, on the sward and give me your attention; what I have to tell you affects you nearly, more so than you now think, and yet Rot you more than myself. I have to make my apologies for the rude manner in which I prevented you to-dav from the commission of a crime!" The twin-brothers loolked at one another in surprise. "A crime 1" murmured Frederick. "A crime, sir I" exclaimed George. "Yes, gentlemen, a crime. For it is a crime, is it not, to raise our hands and voices against the land that gave us birth 1" "We were but discharging a duty," said Frederick, haughtily; " wiat is there criminal in that?"' "What duty were you discharing ?" "That which we owed to the king."    "4       TrM SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS  "Tell me, sirs, the nature of that duty. I must confess I do not under- stand it."  "The duty of all good and loyal subjects: to protect the interests of the  King." Against those of the people? Or is it that the people have no interests?  To serve one man-the king is but a man-you would destroy hundreds,  yea thousands! Is this your creed, O sons of humanity? Iumanity ar-  rayed against humanity, to feed the pride and avarice of one who would crush humanity to exalt himselfI Where learned you this strange and un-  natural doctrine?" In Enr-land." "That England to which you were taken when infants-that England   , which taught you to forget the ties of kindred and country-that England which holds the ashes of your father-that England which tramples upon the  clime of your birth, and by her selfish and oppressive exactions first irritates and then plunges it into madness, suffering and blood-that England which  you have just left to revisit your native land, not to save it, but to help a  tyrant to still further enslave it I And this you call DUTY!" "What mean you, sir!" exclaimed Frederick, in a tone of agitation. "You  transgress the laws of chivalry by thus insulting us. We are your prisoners, but you have no right to take advantage of our position by endeavoring to s persuade us from our fealty to the king!"  "The king-the king-always the king!" said the planter, shaking his head mournfully. "Can your lips utter no higher word than that I Must  you always return to the ledg -! Persuade you from the fealty you owe him? Man's first fealty is to his God-the only King; the next, to his country I What is it you owe the king-and what do you not owe your country?" "You talk strangely, sir. The country is the king." "If so would the king oppress it, and wrap it in fire and smoke and carn- age-what wrise king would do that? Say he's a fool, then, would you allow a fool to guide the affairs of a nation to ruin and destruction? It is because he is at war with the interests of the country, that the country has risen against him. You, who owe allegiance to that country, because it gave you birth, should not be found on the side of its chiefest enemy. It is treason to nature, to humanity, to God!" "How know you we are of this country?" demanded the twins, who were visibly agitated. "How know I that the name of one of you is Frederick, the name of the other George? HQW know I that you both saw the light of heaven at one and the same hour? How know I that you were born in Carolina, and quitted it with your father for England when you were scarcely old enough to prattle the names of father, mother, brother, sister? How was it I re- cognized you both as the sons of Lionel Somers, whose features, air, voice iand figure live again in you as they once lived in him!" The young officers trembled as if shlaken by an ague; but not more so  than the planter, whose powerful will alone prevented him from allowing it to be visible. "O!" he continued, "I could tell you, sirs, of evidences greater even than these. I could tell you of names you were accustomed to prattle fondly ere you quitted Carolina -for England-that England to which you went as  strangers, and which taught you so soon to forget the land in which you were born, the names that you prattled, the forms that you loved. I could tell you of a mother whose heart broke when she lost you--of a brother  whose cheek paled when you went away and returned not, of a sister who grow up without remembering she had seen you!"

"I could tell you," resumed the planter as if they had not spoken, "of a wild, unprincipled adventurer's mercenary marriage with one of God's purest. creatures; of his infidelities, his frauds, his hypocrisies, his cruelties, and his brutalities, times without number, on her his victim-wife; of his robbery of her property, and of his dastardly flight to England with his two pet young- lings, leaving her, his victim, and the other two little ones to breast and struggle as they might with the stern misery in which his brutality had  plunged them I I could tell you of their hard, trying fate for imany a long year, while he, the author of their sufferings, the causer of their woes was rioting in debauchery in another land-in England 1 -with her mnoney, and  training her children and thei? brothers up in forgetfulness of her, of them, and of their country!" "Great God!" cried the twins, moaning with anguish, "what frightful tale, what inhuman man, is this?" "I could tell you," continued the planter, "of the misery which day by day inscribed its woe-prints on the brow of that poor mother, that suffering vic- tim-wife. I could tell you how the rose upon her cheek faded day by day, till it disappeared to return no more. I could tell you how her form lessened gradually away, till it became so frail and slender, that a breath ayppeared potent enough to waft it to its eternal home. I could tell you of her p rayers for the bad man who had deserted her, and for the two loved ones who had forgotten her, in their home far away; -of her sighs in her walks by day and in her dreams by night, as she thought of her Frederick, of her George " q  "Or I had not spoken them," answered the planter, with a calmness that was forced. "And they apply to us, and to our father?" "To your father and to you."  "In every particular?" "Or I had not uttered a solitary word!" "It is terrible--it is frightful! Who, then are you-who tell us this, which tears my brother's heart and mine ?" "I am a living witness of your father's perfidies, your mother's woes. I am at once the accuser of your father, the sole staff and defender of your mother. I am " "Our hearts have guessed it " cried the twins, in a breath, and springing to their feet, as at the same instant the planter also sprang to his. "  You are, yes, you are the first born-our brother i" And they rushed towards to embrace him. "Stand back !" cried the planter, repelling with a calm grandeur which was at once heroic and sublime. "Devoted to my country, I cannot em- brace its enemies; devoted to my mother, I cannot take to my breast those who have forgotten her I" "Great God I great God!" cried the twins, recoiling as if stricken by a thunderbolt. Aqd yet their anguish, though indescribably frightful, was not a jot more excruciating than the planter's, whose heart burned to take them to lis arms, and who yet dared not yield to the desire lest it should mar the great pur- pose he had in view. "You wear the livery of a king who outrages your country, as your father outraged your nother I" he continued mournfully. "You glory in sustain- ing a cowardly and unprincipled monarch, whose hands are reeking with the blood of a brave and high-principled people; a people who have suffered and     48    -    WE SWAMP STeMx, -O1 TtH DAYS endured, till suffering and endurance ceased to be a virtue, and became a festering reproacll.

THave you the heart, then, to ask their love, against whom you have come as enemies?" "Oh, brother-brother!", cried Frederick, stretching forth his arms im- ploritngly, " forgive us-fbrgi've us I WAe sinned unknowingly!" "Oh, brother-brother!" cried George, with a countenance distorted with anguish and pale with despair, "be merciful, and not inflexible!" "And therefibc," said the planter, in a voice that trembled withl an emotion which even his powerfll will could not -wholly control, ".the solemn need ot your r-epentancec 1" "We do repont!" cried Frederick, falling on his knees, and bending his head on his clasped hands. "Forgive-forgive!" "Lowly and suppliant," cried George, following his example, " we implore you to pardon the great error we fell into without giving a thought to its enormity. Forgive-forgive!" "Not to me, but to Him!" said the planter, pointing upward reverently, "kneel for pardon and for grace!" '"We ask them of him--we implore them of youl" cried the twins, and hot tears trickled down their cheeks and moistened their trembling hands. "O call us brothers!" i ' Do you renounce your allegiance to the tyrant who oppresses and deso- lates your country!" "We do-we do. Will you not now call us brothers?" "Do you renounce his livery and his wages?" "We renounce them-we renounce them I O, call us brothers now!" "Do you renounce all ties and all relations with allf who wear his livery, all who live upon his bounty? Ahl 1 you are silent . Is your repentance then but feigned?" "We have friends among them-dear friends!" "I understand you!" said the planter, mournfully. "Your hearts are gone-the daughters of the governor hold them!" The twins were silent; but their features were eloquent with a mingled expression of anguish and surprise. "I know all," said Neil Somers, in answer to their look. "But even them you must renounce!" The brothers groaned at this announcement: and their countenances indi- cated the most hopeless despair. . I "In this your hour of repentance," said the planter, solemnly, "insult not the Supreme One, by a regret based on guile!" "Oh I this is terrible 1" cried the twins reproachfully. "Reflect 1" returned the planter, "Is this love ye bear-or think ye bear --the fair daughters of the governor, uOILY? Is it not the same loire, and founded on the same lustful desire which marked your amours in the land from which ye came, as well as those in which ye have indulged since your arri- val in Carolina? Pause, ere you answer; pause-reflect!" The twin brothers groaned, and bowed down their heads in misery. "It is not love " said the planter, interpreting their silence. "The pas- sion ye entertain is not love; for love is a holy thing which emanates fromr heaven, and purifies the hearts on which it falls from every vestige of gross- ness and sensual desire. Such is not the feeling with which you regard the fair daughters of the Governor! Banish it, then, as you would a leprosy: it is a passion wlhich makes man a leper, woman, a victim." "'We banish it!" murmured the brothers.   O9F BIMAR1ON ASD 1118 MSIERXy IIIEN. '  And wisely.

The twins fell on each other's bosom, and groaned as if their hearts were brealung. This last blow had crushed them. "And yet," sad the planter, in a milder voice, ashe witnessed their suf- fering, which was also the picture of his own,  " if you are sincere in your repentance there yet is hope for her, whose first prayer in the morning and whose last orison at night is for her twin-born sons-for you, if ye indeed desire to meet in a pure re-union--for me  whose heart yearns clasp ye in a  fraternal embrace though it break in the stugge to refuse you Il The twins raised their heads, but not their eyes: for a consciousness of their utter unworthiness prevented them from encountering the glance of their considerate and noble-minded brother. ' Ah. Hope!" they murmured. "Yes," returned the planter, with emotion. " Ropel" "Oh, name it--name it, and save us from despair I' "Labor!" answered the planter.

The man Ned, whom ye saw at table, will be at once your instructor and assistant; a negro, named Mingo, will be your valet and pur- veyor. You can rely on the Ititlhfulnss of both "' The twin brothers turned on him a look beaming with gratitude and joy "Are you satisfied?" asked the planter. They bowed; their hearts were too full for utterance. "Enough. Kneel then, here, with me."  All dropped revererently upon their knees. "To Thee!" said the planter, witl an air of grandeur and impressiveness which would have become a ldng, "to Thee, we look for strength to do away  with the False, and assume the garments of the True. Hear us I Here in the solemn midnight-beneath yon glorious dome bright with stars of silver : -in the lighlt of yon noble orb whose pure radiance reflects Thy supreme , power and serene majesty-in the calm silence of this field, clothed with the rich mantle of earth's mother, Nature-on this spot shut out from a turbu-  lent and impure world by towering trees, whose leafy murmurs instead of  disturbing, add to the tranquility of the soul,-we devote ourselves, from this hour, to a new life that will, we trust, prove acceptable to Thee!

Spare us, Thou I Be with us, Thou I Shield us, Thou! And the glory of our salvation shall be ascribed to Thee!" They rose, trembling in every joint; the planter with agitation arising from this interview with two beings whom he desired so much to take to his heart: the twins from the mingled emotions of surprise at what they had learned, admiration of the noble heart which reposed in the breast of their brother, and the emotions naturally following his consecration of themselves to their new career. "Allow me, gentlemen," said the planter, " to offer you my ann to the house. We are, individually, too weak to proceed thither alone." There was a delicacy in the delivery of this invitation which impressed the twins with a still deeper sense of the natural nobleness of the planter's soul.  Each took an arm, gently, lovingly, pressing it with all the fondness of a young bride leaning on her beloved: and they proceeded slowly to the lodge, amid a silence which was broken only by heart aching sighs. "Ere we part," said Frederick, in a faltering voice, " bless u1 O bless us, once-only once I with one word-one wordi" "Cheer 'us," added George, "in this the dawn-hour of our repentance. Our hearts-our hearts are bleeding!" And on the pale and quivering faces of the .twins there was a shade of frightful agony. "Brothers! Brothers l" cried the planter, rushing from the apartment, unable longer to endure it. "Bless you-bless you-God bless you!" cried the twins. And thus passed the deeply solemn night into the small still hours of morning.   OF MARTON AID    Ms MERRY MEN.                 51 CHAPTER VII.  Early the following morning, the planter and his two fi-iends, arose, and made their appearance in'the main room of the lodge, where they found the man Ned and his assistant Mingo already preparing breakfast. "Where are they ?" asked the planter, who was somevwhat pale. "They have not risen yet," replied Ned. "I went to their room to call them, but they looled so pale and woe-worn that I had not the heart to wake them    When do you wish to start, sir ?" "Immediately,'" answered the planter with a slight degree of emotion. The morning meal was soon ready. When it was despatched, the planter went to a small closet, and taking out a blank volume, tore out a leaf, and wrote the following note- "I am about to depart, and as you are not up, I am deprived of the pleas- ure of bidding you adieu. Perhaps it is better, for our mutual sakes that it should be so, as a parting interview could not be otherwise than painful. Oblige me by keeping a journal of your progress in the good work on wlich you have now entered, the appliances for which you will find ready at your hand. I will call upon you at least once a month during the term of your probation. Should I fail in these visits in any one instance, it will be be- canse I am not in a position to appear before you, in which case I will writ.e Bewae of the seducer and destroyer of your sister: yo know to whom I allude. It is not impossible that he may discover your whereabouts, in which case you might be tempted to avitge your sister; but touch him not: leave him to me.

Till then, unless he come wilfully across my path, he is safe fiom hand of mine. Persevere in your noble resolution, and I shall love you; and when I am assured of the completeness of your penitence, that hour I will lead you to my beloved parent, and say to her: Mother, behold the twin-bornmones for whose presence you have so long yearned; they are worthy of your embrace and your love: take them to your heart, as I have already taken them to mine. That re-union, my friends, you cannot desire with more impatience than NEL SoArns." Baving folded and delivered this letter, together with some trifling instruc- tions to Ned, the planter, the gentleman from St. Johns, and the scalp hunter mounted their horses, and took leave of the forest lodge. As they descended the hill, the planter related the whole of the scene of the preceding nigllt with the exception of that part of it relating to Richard Winter. "Have you no fears that they will break through their resolution?" asked Marion. "None, sir," returned the planter. " They lave passed their nord and I have every confidence in the promise of a Somers." "I trust. that everything will meet your expectations, my friend. But this Richard Winter; what i' he should discover their retreat ?" "It would not be attended mith any danger. I   leave prepared thlle   for even that emereney."  "Upon my word    my gallant friend, I know not what to make of you. But of one thing I am confident-your country will find in you one of its most noble champions; and I congratulate myself on my good fortune in get- ting you for one of my aids. As for you, Nat," he continued, turning to the woodsman, "your fame as a marksman and a man of an acute mind is fia-    J2        TUE G-WATMP STEED ; Or, TIrE' S    .  miliar to me. I shall take such measures as will call into action loth of your good qualities, witflh profit to the country and honor to yourselves. But here we are at the foot of the mountain; and as I am now in my own district of St. Johns, I shall at once proceed home. You had both better make imme- diate preparations fbr the storm that is coming, and report yourselves to me,  on Wednesday next, at Charleston. Good day, gentlemen.' And waving them an ad, Marion gave rein to his horse, and was soon out of sight. "May my old Sal never drop anuther yaller belly " exclaimed the scalp ' hunter, looking after him, "efI don't like our cap'n! The grit is in his muscles and the geneyus in his head. He's got the quietest ways with him; don't say a word more'n is hess'ry, and then slips off as ef he hadn't a minit to spar.' Wut du yew think on him, Neil?" "I think," returned the planter, "that he is the man for the times. HHe carries it in his features, and in his movements.. But I must to Kingstree: for I have much to think of, and to do." "And I must up tu my lodge, and git ready fur the campaign. Good bye,  Neil-I'll see yew at Charleston." They shook hands, and parted; and, each filled with his own thoughts, proceeded on their several destinations.  In a few hours, Neil Somers rode thoughtfully into Kingstree. The village presented an animated appearance. Numbers of both sexes were out, the men looking thoughtful and stern-the fair, suspicious and pale; the majority of the former wore hangers at their sides, and in many instances had rifles  over their shoulders or in their hands. On the green were numbers of chil- dren, armed with pieces of wood, toy-guns, and various other implements, drilling, marching and countermarching, like grown-up soldiery. A martial air was everywhere and around everything. Another fact struck the planter,' as he passed through the village. It was the sudden change in the social habits of the people. Men, who were but yesterday friends and companions, passed each other like strangers to-day; and their wives, sharing in the sympathies of their husbands and lovers, fol- lowed in this respect the example they had set. "Ah," murmured the planter, with a mournful sigh, "it begins to work  Brothers begin already to look coldly on their brothers, fathers upon their sons, sons upon their fathers, and friends upon their friends I By and bye, when the work of the Revolution has fairly begun, brother will be divided against brother, father against son, friend against friend, by a wall of blood, f of which each will contribute his share I 'Tis frightful to ponder on, and yet  to that it must come. Oh, my country I my country I is this to be the price of thy freedom, this to be the cost of thy glory!" And he rode on, his brain aching and swelling with the painful picture his fancy had thus conjured up before him, while his presence and appearance were calling forth the attention and remarks of numbers of the promenaders. "There goes the gallant hero of yesterday," said a young farmer, to his companion, as the planter passed up the street. "Look there, wife, there's that rascally rebel, Neil Somers. How thought- ful lie looks!"  "Yes, and you'd look thoughtful too, old man/if God had given you a head like his, instead of the empty noddle you carry upon your shoulders!" an- swered his spouse, in a tone which silenced at once the observations of the old tory. "There's young Somers!" observed the daughter of a wealthy lawyer, to her mother. "I do wish he'd turn this way. Don't you think he's hand- some, ma'?" "'Certainly, my dear; there can be no question about that. Mr. Somers is a very charming young man; and very winning, as well. Do you remem-   OF IA!:rnON AND r 1JS :,.;rE:fY lnF:-.  ber what your pa', who was quite carried away by his speech on the green, said about him at tea last evening?" "I've such a bad memory, ma' What was it?" "That he should have been bred to the bar! That was the highest com- pliment he thought could be paid him; and certainly nothing coild have been finer from the lips of a lawyer i" "I do wonder where he is going?" said the young lady, looking after the planter. He appears to be going in the direction of Mrs. Brunton's, my dear." "That odious young widow I Oh, ma'!" "She may be odious to youl my dear; but she is certainly handsome, and very rich." "Oh, ma', how can you say so?" "What I that she is rich?" "No--handsome!   chy, she is twenty-eight, at least l" "Neverthefess, she is veCly handsome. Besides, you are a little too s ite- ful in your remarks. Mrs. Brunton is but twenty-four, and is generalljdd- mitted to be very beautiful." "Do you think she will get him, ma'?" I do believe you are jealous, my dear. You certainly can have no claim upon Mr. Somers!" "I don't know ma' i"' answered the little beauty, with a blush as deep as crimson. "Stranger things than that have happened!" "You make me smile, my dear!" "But you havn't answered my question!" persisted the pert beauty. "Do you think she will get him?" "I cannot say, my dear. I have heard that Mr. Somers' affections were placed upon Miss Winter, and that her brother made some pretensions to the widow, who however would not accept him for a suitor." "But, ma', Mrs. Brunton, does love Mr. Somers; she would scratch her eyes out for him!" "I have no doubt of it. And she will doubtless use every legitimate means to achieve his conquest. But I hope my dear, you have noserious intention of entering the lists with her."              i "Why not, ma'?" demanded the little beauty, with an assurance that brought a smile to her mother's lips. "Because, she is too experienced. Widows are superior rivals in such matters, my dear; they know all the wealpoints of a lover, and when they attack him, do it with a confidence that generally ensures success. Until you have been married and lost your husband, my dear, you must not enter the lists with so accomplished a widow as Mrs. Brunton. But see; I was right. Mr. Somers has really reined in at the widow's!" It was as she said. The planter had pulled up at the gate of a large and with one of those wide fronts and large piazzas so common in the dwellings of the opulent of that day. Giving his horse in charge of a younog well-dress- ed negro, belonging to the mansion, the planter passed through the gate, and tapping  gently at the door, was shortly after ushered into the drawing- r O  room. He had scarcely been seated when a light quick step was heard in the hall; ancd in another moment, Mrs. I3runton, her countenance radiant w iith a smile of genial happiness, md her appearance. She was a gorgeous fascinating creature. In form she was of a medium heig  i  1i   :  -- . . 'he was         of a medium heigh, and slightly i nclininm to embonpoint. Jer features were straight and small, h er eyes of a i, rich, clear blue: her coamplexion of a dazzling white, and her thick, glossy, ringletty tresses of that singular fairness peculiar to those of Saxon origin. She was dressed in a close-fitting shape of purple - - .... --pu I p u  rpI      velvet, whose surface gfli; eued at her every movement like a flash of golden light, and whose beautiful seLting developed the faultless symmetry and pas-  sion-inspiring outlines of her voluptuous forLm. She was, evidently, a creature of high feeling, and of a liberal and capa- cious intellect; artful it might be, but at the satie tirme of a generous, though passionate, nature. Her noverenets were easy and graceful, and, while full of dignity, free as a proud belle's conscious of her purity and beauty.  As she entered, her eye caught that of her visitor, and running up to him and holding out both of her hands, with a genial heartiness of 'manner, she exclaimed--             -                  ! "My dear Neil, how charmned I am to see you! This visit is a pleasure and honor causing me inexpressible delight! How have you been, truant?" "Well, well, my dear friend!" replied the planter, imprinting a kiss on her small, delicate hand. "And my dear Mrs. Somers?" "Happy and tranquil, as usual," returned the plahter, drawing her gently  dol beside him on the sofa. "And you, with whom I used to gambol in myboyhood-- need not ask after your health; for the rose that ever blush- ed, blushes still upon your cheeks; the fairy air and bounding step, and the  sparkling eye which graced your romping days, cling to you still"  "Out, flatterer!' cried the widow, archly. "How long is it since my gal- lant play fellow turned a whisperer of loving periods? What! do you still remember our strolls amid the fields, our rides far up the hills, and our  romps in the murmuring woods?"                       i And our sails upon the lake!" said the planter.  "Ah! you do remember them!   And then our bird-nesting in the groves?" "And our rambles through the dells," continued Somers, in the same genial tone. "And our flower-hunts in the wilds!" cried the lovely widow, as the  drawing-room rang with the music of her laughter. "Ah, lady!" said the planter, "you are one,of nature's choicest pets- always merry, gentle, happy, and-must I say it-fascinating!" "Thank you for nothing!" exclaimed Mrs. Brunton, with a charming pout; "how long is it sinee I became ',lady?' In our younger days you used to call me Laura!"    . "Ah! you chide cruelly, now! Will you not let your old playfellow  fall back on the only entrenchment left to shield him from the murderous fire of those blue eyes? Think of the hazard to this heart of my calling you by a name familiar! Have you no mercy?" "Have done, hypocrite-do!" cried the bewitching creature, who would  at that moment have pawned her very soul could she have believed he spoke as a lover, and not as a gallant friend. "Do you know, Neil," she added, you Bave been the town talk since yesterday?"  "Ah!".returned the planter, shaking his head, playfully; " the town is famous for its prattle; and my name must, like everybody's else, be mixed up in the scandal, and handled in its turn I What does the town say?" "Oh," cried the widow with a mischievous air, "I shall not tell you with- out a fee." Bravo! Tell me then, pretty trafficker, your price." "Will you pay?"  "Promptly as an honest debtor, when he has th means!" "Very good; then my fee is-call me in future by my name, and not by    i my positionl" "Mrs. Brun-" "No," cried the lively creature, interrupting him, "Laura!" "Here it is, then," said the planter, lifting her hand to his lips, "Laura!"

"I'll look out for that I Now, then, tell me, enchantress, what they say of me in the town." "They say," said the fair syren, " that you are the man of Carolina-" The planter blushed; and his eyes fell before those of his companion. "That in the storm now rising, you will be the eagle whose bold pinions will lift your country's banner triumphantly above the smoke and din of battle-" The' planter shook his head, without raising it. "That yours is the voice will raise hearts that may droop, yours tho lips will shed light through their darkness, joy through their gloom-" "Stay," said Somers, imploringly, " stay, Lh-- Tlhe widow lifted her finger, archly. "Laura, I care not for the opinions of the town," he continued, recover- ing himsef. "The truth is, it attaches too much importance to one who is in the face of all its praises, but a mere unit in the family of patriots Teli me, Laura, has Richard Winter been seen in town to day?" "Yes; he appeared, very early this morning, at the head of a troop of horse, at the Palmetto. You can guess why?" "To retake my two prisoners?" "Yes. They say that he nearly tore the inn to pieces, on discovering that he was anticipated. He accused the landlord of collusion, felled him to the floor, and injured him so severely that his life was at first despaired of.' "I am sorry for him. But, unfortunately, we live in times when broken heads and bruised bones appear to be man's natural heritage. And on this score, Laura, I wish to converse with you, as a gentleman may converse with a lady whom he esteems, as a friend may converse with a friend in whom he has confidence. But, I warn you it is a delicate subject, and one whose very nature is significant of the very high regard I entertain for you 1" Mrs Brunton's heart throbbed violently, and a pleasure she could not stifle made her naturally bright eyes sparkle with unusual brilliancy. "Am I then to be so happy?" she murmured, to herself. "Is it his hand he is about to offer me?--oh, happineuss unspeakable I 'Tis an Eden I a&i to enter; 'tis the confession of his love I am about to hear I ' O happiness- happiness!" So great, so nearly overpowering, was the picture her passionate fancy had created, she could scarcely retain her self-possession. "Hear me, Laura," began the planter, who attributed her joyous air to the happiness it gave her as his friend to be worthy of his confidence, and to have the ability to serve him. "The. storm now gathering will be a fearful one, and one which will sweep many a stout and sturdy man from compc- tence to beggary, from safety down to peril, from peril down to death." "I can readily comprehend that, Neil," said Mrs. Brunton, who was puz- zled to understand how such a prologue could possibly precede the comedy of a declaration. "Men," continued the planter, with the air, though unwittingly, of a man who had come to his conclusions by deep searching and long ponderings upon his subject " will array themselves one against the other, in the coun- cils of state as in the conflict on the field;, and of the two parties thus form- ed, the one will be in power, to-day: the other, on the morrow. It appears, then, clearly evident to me that many a private hatred now existing among the men composing these two parties, will be carried into this contest, and-such is human nature-there gratified by such weapons as power will throw into their hands. The tory of to-day will be in possession of the government to- morrow, and, carrying his private animc sity with him, will use the political     56        THE SWA SW STEED OR THE DAYS             X , J sword in his hand, to cut off the private fortunes of his rebel enemy's, by get- ting his estate confiscated for his treason. So, on the other hand, when in '1s his turn the rebel mounts to power, he will make his private tory foe suffer doubly in his defeat, by declaring his property forfeited to the common weal?i for his adherence to the king."                      j "I think I understand now, Neil, the point at which you are driving," said Mrs. Brunton, with a sigh. s And the sparkle fled slowly from her eye, and the color from her cheek,  and her heart grew chilly, desolate and hard, for the thought which had  i made her for a few brief moments happy, had glided off, and was succeeded  by a black ugly, cloud.       h She listened, with the smile still. on her lips, but with an inexpressive eye which was the index of her soul. "Go on, Neil," she said; and she was conscious that, as on her heart, a  change had come over the cadences of her voice. "And therefore," continued Somers, "I have thought I owed it to a dear and tender mother, to provide for an emergency- which might, for all that I ' could say or do, throw her helpless and a beggar on the world. Every man has more or less enemies; I have mine, and the course I have marked out for the contest that is coming will make me many more. I am willing to pay such penalties as my own conduct may provoke; but I am not willing that my dear and only parent should suffer for any act of mine."  "That is commendable, Neil; that is noble"!" Somers bowed, and went on. "It is this, Laura, which brings me here to-day; it is this which inspires Ine to open my heart in confidence to you, and to ask of you a favor." Colder and colder, harder and harder waxed the heart of the impetuous widow. It was not to her charms that she was indebted for his visit; it was not even to courtesy, nay, nor to common friendship-it was business, which brought him to her house: cold, stern, unfeeling business. Her heart was not only cold and hard-it began even to grow black! 'Go on, Neil," she said..  Her voice was clear and musical as ever, but not tinged with the slightest accent of feeling. "Men who take an active part in this contest, and I will be one of them," continued the planter, not noticing, because not looking for nor understand- ing the cause of any change in his companion's manner, "will be marked the first, punished the earliest. Persons in your position, Laura, will of course be exempt from all troubles and annoyances of this kind, and therefore it is I have come to you to shield my mother's property from danger, by transferring it over to you, and making it appear yours, till the storm is over and all fears of further danger at an end." "Htow do you wish this done?" asked Mrs. Brunton, calmly. "Unless there be a sale of the estate drawn up and conveyed in due form, the fraud would be detected." The planter look6d up at her in surprise. He did not understand how she could have used the offensive word we have italicised, unless through premeditated malice, which he could not for a moment credit, or else through a want of knowledge of terms, an idea which he felt satisfied must be- correct as the calm and innocent glance of his companion met his own. Not willing that she should comprehend his first suspicion, he replied: ".That, Laura, is the favor I have come to ask at your hands." "To purchase your mother's property?" "Yes,-and to make it perfectly safe, in case death should overtake her and me, to buy it at one-half its actual worth." The widcw saw in an instant, in the delicacy of this blow, that she was understood; and, as, notwithstanding her struggle to repress it, a tell-tale   OF MARION AND IIS M2ER RY M':N,         57 blush mounted slowly to her brow, she made an effort tc w'ad him to the conviction that his suspicion was wholly based on error. "That would indeed blind theml" she said, with a forced smile, " and make  everything safe for your mother. But I will. not consent to it!"  "No?" said the planter, in a tone of surprise. '   No, Neil, not for a moment. You appear to have made provision for everything but one-and that you have entirely neglected 1" "Your refusal, Laura?" he said. Yes," she answered; with a calmness that staggered him, " and one thing else!" And that is-" That something might happen to me! I might die!" "You, Laura-you die!" "I! Would there be anything strange in that?" "There would! You are endowed with attributes which give health to their possessor and lead her to a green old age-your buoyant spirits, happy heart and guileless nature!" This was a second blow, and quite as artfully interwoven in his reply, as the ' fraud' was in her question. "I might die," she replied, without evincing the slightest consciousness of his double meaning; " and my heirs might not feel disposed to do you justice; in which case, Neil," she added with a tenderness that was not all assumed, "could I rest quietly in my grave?" "True," observed Somers, whose suspicion was fast vanishing; "that was an emergency wlich, it must be confessed, I never took into considera- tion. And it is no marvel either: for who, looking at yon, the ideal of youth and loveliness and health, would dream that any other future was before you than one of unalloyed happiness-a vista of bright flowers on a plain where reigns perpetual spring." "Ah, Neil, it is nbt age alone that sweeps us from these shores to those of the Beyond. Hearts sometimes fall and wither, even while their trunks are full of youth and vigor!"  "That is easily true!" said the planter, now awakened for the first tine to the fact that his'companion was the victim of an unreturned attachment, but not dreaming for one moment that himself was its object. "'Tis said that Winter visits her," he murmured. "Can it be she loves him, and without hope? Or does he dally with her, as he did with my sister-playing at one and the same time the two characters of trifler and seducer?" It was a delicate subject, one in which he could not, as a gentlemen, take any other part than that of a listener. If she felt disposed to make him a confidant, he could not, he thought. do less than listen, and if she asked it, advise. But it would-thus he argued with himself-be indelicate to ask an explanation of her meaning, or appear to understand that anything further was implied in her words than that of a passing observation. He therefore remained mute, while he gave to his features an air of the most profound im- passibility. "Is it possible that he does not understand in e!" thought the widow. "Or is it that he will not? Oh, the curse of custom! which will not permit a woman to lay open her heart except by rude hints which may not be un- derstood, and glances wlich may not be interprceted aright, 1" She saw however the necessity of banishing the last vestige of suspicion from his mind, and of convincing him that nothing meanlyr selfilsh mwas in her thoughts or disposition at the moment of her refusal. "But I have thought of a plan, Neil"/ she resumed, with orne of her most fas(inating smiles, and in a tone replete with tenderuss; " by whiih you can be saved from the danger you so justly fear from your tory eiemniiv, fromn all. 8     t&        TTrI SWA5kU STEED; O1, THE DAYS peril tha ,it probably arise from my heirs in case I should die, as well as  exclude from the eyes of the law the possibility of an idea of a collusion?" "  Altl?" : t I the planter, inquiringly. "It must be a stroke of genius then, Latura." "And yet a very simple one, Neil," said Mrs. Brunton. "It is this-let me buy your plantation at it, full value. Let what will happen then, no i danger can come to you or yours. Should I live, you know you can regain  it at a moment's warning; should I die, my heirs wrould be glad to dispose of it at its value. Meanwhile, you have the use of the purchase money, with- out interest, or any claim of mine or those who may follow me!" "You are a glorious girl, Lall'a!" cried the planter with an outhurst of feeling which proclaimed that not a shadow of suspicion rested longer in his  mind. "You should have been born to a throne, for you are the royalest of queens in heart and soul! Now I understand the cause of your refusal. It ' wans to crush me with a gencrosity as unlooked for as it is noble!"  "Ah!"  murmured the fair widow, "would that I could but overwhelm  him with love! What bliss, then, what Eden would compare with mine!"  "I will not insult your feelings, Laura, by declining your generous offer.  Yes, I will accept it for my mother's sake and yours!" He might have added for his country's; for it was in reality for it that he wished the money: there being at home quite enough to amply provide for i the household, let what might arise. "'Tis well, Neil. And now let me assure you that I regard it as one of the happiest moments in my existence to possess the ability to do you even so slight a favor." "I believe it, Laura, I believe it I I shall henceforth pray for you as my mother's guardian angel!"  "Would I were yours!" murmured his companion. "When do you wish this affair ratified, Neil?" she added, aloud. As soon as you can make it- convenient: for in truth, Laura, I have much to do, and but little time to do it in." "Say to-morrow, thct?"  "I will. At what hour?" "Name it yourself, Neil." "What if I make it ten?"  "It will please me very well." "So be it then. I'll bring my mother down, and be in Kingstree with her at that hour." "Where shall we meet?"  Here, if it please you."  "Nothing would please me better. I will send a messenger for Mr. Sprague, my lawyer, and bid him be in readiness.' "Thank you, Laura, my more than friend-my sister!" said the planter, raising her hand to his lips. "Your sister!" murmured the widow. "I will be nearer yet than that-- your wife! if this brain can bring it about!" "Adieu, Laura! I must be on my way," said the planter, rising. "What, Neil-so soon?" said Mrs. Brunton, with a smile of ineffable sweetness. ;' Pardon me, Laura, but every moment is precious-for my time now is not my own, but my country's!" "Go, then Neil!' returned the lady, with a gush of admiration. "Let me not detain you a moment from a cause so holy. Go, Neil; and bear this ever in your memory: daily and nightly Laura Brunton wil pray fervently for your welfare!" She dropped her eyes and a graceful courtesy; and-the planter, with'a dig- nified reverelnct quitted the drawing-room, murmuring:   OP MA UOIN ,AND LS3 rMlrsrtY MEN.      59 A moment more in her askc3tinatg presence, and I were lost 1 A moment more, and Amy, myself, an I all the world were forgot!" Mrs. Brunton witnesed tlis dleparture from a window, and never turned away from the blinds till he litd disappeared.  "I will yet be yours, Neil!" she murmured; "yours-yours only I Not all the world shall stop it. Youil' or death's!" She paced the room, deeply agitaated; her heart beating wildly, and hcer temples throbbing as if they would burst. "Is it then, after all, so diiticult a taskl to win hin?

Love knows no friends, save those who aid it in its con- quest-of the heart for which it bleeds.

All's fair in love. Let her who can achieve the victor's laurel!" CHAPTER    VIII. On quitting Mrs. Bnmton's Neil Somers turned off from the village, and btruck homeward. His plantation was situated about two miles from Kings- , tree, a distance which his gallant steed soon accomplished. At the gate of the lawn facing the cottage, stood ]Mrs. Somers, anxiously waiting her son's arrival. She was a lady of about three and forty, with a very matronly appearance. Her features were small and delicate, and her general air that of a gentle-hearted and pure-minded being. She was dressed in a neat dark frock, and a cap, whose snowy folds seemed scarcely whiter than her own calm'brow and pale cheeks. "Neil, my love," said she, in a tone of great affection, as he dismounted and entered the lawn, "I have been so uneasy. What news have you?" "The best, mother. Mrs. Brunton has agreed to take the plantation at its ful value." "I don't mean that, my dear. Has no one attempted to use violence--. I-realy, Neil, I am so nervous that I can scarcely speak." "Take my arm, mother," said the planter, with air of deep respect and strong filial love, "and let us proceed to the house. What has happened?" he added, as they seated themselves on the piazza "Mr. Abel Winter was here, but a little while since, and he quite alarned me." "Did he dare to insult you, mother?" "No, my dear. He told me that warrants were out against you, for your conduct yesterday at the village, and that you could not avoid arrest. He mentioned it to me as a friend." "Fear not, mother. The rebels are too strong in this district Jr the royal officers to lay hands on any of their number." "I told him so: but he persisted in stating that there was no safety for you except in immediate flight. He added that, in case you were taken, nothing on earth could save you." ..*     60        ,TUE SW t1A,1 ST'i:DD; on RIE DAYS            5 "amn very much obliged to Mr. Winter for hiii anxiety in my welfarel  iVhen did he say I was likely to be taken?"              r "ImInediately. The officers, he said, -were now in search of you."  i "I passed some on the road; but they made no attempt to take me. The fact is, my dear mother, the country is at present too unsettled for the crown it to show its power. Be. tranquil; they will not arrest me. But you have r other news for me, mother, have you not? I can read it in your manner." t'I " Yes,' answered Mrs. Somers, sorrowfully. "But do not way give to it!  Here it is," and she drew a letter from her bosom. "Mr. Winter gave it to nme verbally ; but I told him I had not the heart to do deliver it, and he then sat down and penned it."         -- Neil opened the letter calmly, and read as follows:-  fi Mr. Somers.-Your conduct at Kipgstree, by which you placed yourself By in opposition to the crown, hakC t you off from the friendship and sympathy of all true subjects of the king j It is perhaps unnecessary for me to add that I cannot, as a good and loyaj citizen, permit any further intimacy between my family and yWs ,-- ErMd-specially between my daughter Amy and your- self. Your own good sense will teach you that I cannot allow my reputation as a sound loyalist to be brought into suspicion by encouraging the visits of one who is in the position of a rebel. With sentiments of the highest respect, I remain, sir,          Yours, &c., ABEL WINTER." After having read this letter a second time, Neil tore it carefuHly into a thousand fragments, which he threw to the winds.           -  'S "Why do you use his note in that way, my love?" asked his mother in a tone of tender reproach. "Mr. Winter has always treated us with the high- est consideration." "Very true, mother. I use it thus to prevent it from ever appearing  against him, in case anything should happen to me. Reflect! it might in- jure him should it ever be known he had corresponded with a rebel, no matter what the pretext."    ,  "You are always nobly considerate, ihy dear Neil," said his mother, fondly, "But you are pale, my dear!" "'Tis nothing, mother. These things should be looked for! Have you seen her of late?" "Yes, my dear. She was here this morning." "In smiles?" continued the planter, in a voice half made upof bitterness. "No, in tears. Her father had said to her-' See him no more-forget,  him 1"')  "And she?" "Amy is a good and dutiful daughter, my son, and worthy of your highest  esteem I answered Mrs. Somers, with an air of great tenderness. "I understand you, mother. She will obey him?" "To the best of her ability-yes"I She will see me no more?" "No more. Her father has commanded her!" The planter covered his face with his hands. "Oh, my son I my son!" cried his parent, drawing towards him, tenderly, "I can appreciate and sympathize with you in your agony. But, O! don't let it tear you thus silently. Weep, weep, Neil-let your heart relieve its reinguish in tears, or it will break. Weep, weep, Neil, weep 1" But the planter was silent; not even a sigh escaped him. A few vibra- tions of the muscles alone told of the frightful agony, wrenching his power- . ful spirit. Mrs. Somers trembled as she beheld her son's deep grief. She was in the utmost distress.    OF MARION AND HS MERRt AMEN.         01. "Be tranquil, my son!" she exclaimed. "Amy loves you; her heart is  yours. She cannot take it away, she cannot forget you, and would not if she could. She loves you; and' if her hand be not yours, it will never be  another's. She bade me tell you that, to soften the cruelty of her father's      I blow. Don't let it affect you so terribly, my dear. Neil! NIil I your agony  wrings my heart!"  As she spoke, she fell, with a shower of tears upon his neck; and there was a silence of some moments, broken only by her sighs. At length, the young man took his hands from his face, and looking up- ward, for a moment, said, with a voice that came up from the lowest depths of his soul- "His will be done!" And he bowed his head, reverently. These few moments of love's anguish had altered him frightfully. His pale countenance was at least ten years older than before. Mrs.. Somers became seriously alarmed for her son. "Oh, Neil-Neil!" she cried, wringing her hands, "my heart bleeds for you 1" The planter looked up and took her hand, mournfully. "Mother " he said, in a voice which she scarcely recognized, "let uA speak of this-of her-no more!" CHAPTER IX. AT the time appointed, Neil Somers made his appearance at the rendez- vous in Charleston. He found the city in a state of great commotion. The royal officers were nowhere to be seen; whereas the rebels were visible everywhere. The planter had scarcely arrived, when Nat the woodsman joined him "Hello I Neil, how air yew? When did yew cum down tu town?" ",But now. I have not been here ten minutes." "Du tell! I've been here fur an hour or more, and been looking raound. They du say things look as ef the Britishers had an idee of tryin' our mettle. They're in sight" " "Who?" "The red coats, 'way out thar'l" And he pointed seaward. "A hull  fleet on 'em. They've been tryin' to get in for a good many days, but they aint able to git cross the bar I Calms, contrary winds, and sech things wunt let 'em in!" "That then accounts for the agitation of the people. But where can our man be?" "Over there, most like," answered the woodsman, pointing to a rough for- tification on a small island at the mouth of the harbor. "Beg pardon, sir 1" said a fisherman, approaching them, and'touching his hat respectfully " arn't your name Somers?" "Yes, friend. What then?" "And yours," continued the fislhlermau, turning to the scalp lunter, "is Akerman, arn't it?" "Wot dews that argify?" demanded the woodsman. "This!" answered the fisherman. "You've come here for Captain Marion, who is, unexpectedly, over there in Fort Sullivan, and where he bade me conduct you."  .  "We are at your disposal," said the planter.     62        THf SWAMP STEED  OL TLE DAYS            ! Then fmloTw rme," s tid the man, who led the way to the river side, where a long, narrow barge, with six stout rowers, was in waiting.     q Thie planter and woodsman st!epped aboard aid seated themselves astern; : mrd in another moment, thcy were pulling away from the city, whch, as  they drew out into the stieam, appmared to be laboring under a spirit of un- usual restlessness and activity. iThey reaiched Sullivan's Island in the course of an hour, and springing t^ ashore, iollowed the fisherman lLp to the fort, which they found preparing g cagerly for battle.            The fort was a large square, witl a bastion at each angle. It was built of logs laid one upon another, the spaces between being filled witl sand. The  logs were of paltmetto wood, a very spungy tree, which receives and retains a bullet or cannon ball without making an extended fracture or injuring the adjacent parts. Tho utmost activity prevailed; the men were engaged in arrangin- the gnts and extending the fort, which was scarcely half finished.  "Whar is Captain Marion?" as;kcd the planter of the fisherman. "Tiere," said the latter, pointing to a group of officers near the flag-staff. The smalles:t ian in that party ofrfour. Follow Inc."        :. And lie led the way toward the group, oce of whom advanced to meet then as they approached. It was Marion.  "I anm happy to see you, sirs," he said, extending his hand to each with a Dle:ant air. "Are you ready for service? If so, I can give you a post vheore honor follows hand in hand with danger." "We are here for duty, sir," returned the planter; " and desire to be placed where we can be of most service to our country."  "I'll look out for that," said Marion, with a friendly air. "Do you see that gun?"And he pointed as he spoke to a thirty-two pounder which stood before an embrasure facing the flag-staff. The planter bowed. "Very welL I give it to your charge. It is the largest gun in the fort, and ought to tell the best story. See that it sustains itself with honor." He left them, and the planter and woodsman entered at once on duty. Thrown upon their own resources, they had to be their own teachers in gunnery; an art, however, for which they were in some degree prepared by their perfect mastery of small arms. In the oourse of the day, a young man approached, whose faoe was fami- liar to them both. "Mr. Jasper?" said the planter, inquiringly. "Yes, sir," answered the young man; " sergeant at your service." "Who is in command of the fort, sergeant?" "Colonel Moultrie, that tall man you see over there with captain Marion." "There appear to be two regiments here," said the planter. "It is so, sir. The one is under Moultrie himself; and the other under captain Marion, and each is extremely solicitous for theconduct and honor of his men." ".A natural desire," observetthe planter. "Yes; and one which the Williamsburg boys share in common with their commander. Marion's men will do their duty." ' No fear of that. When do they expect the enemy?" "T'he fleet has been telcgraphed and may be along to-night; perhaps not till to-morrow. If we only have powder enough to hold out, we'll give 'emn a little Son' Car'lina juice. Do you think you can manage that gun?" "I've an idee we'll get along," said the woodsman. "Most likely," said Jasper, good humoredly. "-We're allinexperienced in this cannon business; but when it comes to the rifle, we'rp at home!" "At present," said the planter, we must do as well as we know how." "The eyes of the city are on us," observed Jasper.   OF MARION AND nIS MERE Y    .   - N  "Ya'as, an the eyes of the kentry, tu 1" cried a tall, lcnder, singular per-  sonage, whom they all recognized, approaching them. He was warmly welcomed by the party, each of whom was familiar with  his merits as one of the boldest and shrewdest men of the borders. He was a tall, slender, wiry personage, and dressed in the yello , hunting  shirt, leggins and buskins of the frontier. In appearance, he w3 all angles  and edges. His long, hooked nose, his sharply jutting brow and bold, pointeda  chin gave to his features an a1ngular ensemble in perfect, keepinig with his sharp shoulders, sharp elbows, and long sharp fingers; and these again were in perfect harmony with the broad rim of his slouched liat which fell off in every direction like so many points with sharp borders; the fringes of hii. hunting shirt were worn down to perfect edges; as were the fringes on the sides of  his leggins; as were also even the tops of his buskins.  This man who had already rendered himself famous on the fiontiers, as a destroyer of "red meat," was destined to cut a si'milar figure upon the broad field on which he had now entered. "Haow ar' ye?" lie added, with a long, nasal twang. "Aint bin here long, I spose? Nor I nuther. They du say, we're goin to hev it pesky sharp, when the red-coats an blew-jackits come up I What du you think? My pinion ar', they wunt find it so natrally easy after all. yWhen I wus ashore, in thl city, this mornin', a tory feller ses to me, ses he, 'thei fleet that's  comin' up will bring yew rebels to yer senses.' Ses I, Mister, if thef don't take our senses away, we shan't complain I Ha! ha! 'twantso bad, was it?" "Very clever!" answered Jasper. "But, tell us Snipe, what do you think. of that?' And as he spoke, he pointed out to sea, where, riding up the horizon, now appeared the tapering masts of a large frigate.  The black, far-reaching eyes of the frontiersman, together with those of the party around him, as well as those of every man in the fort, were sud-  denly fixed in mute astonishment on the object which had so suddenly ar-  rested their attention.  The frigate had scarcely cleared the line of the horizon, when another leapt h sight; this was followed by a third, which was succeeded by a fourtt, and that by a sixth, and these by three others, till the offing appeared like a for- est of black masts. "Thar's nine on 'em!" cried the scalp hunter. "We shall have warm work!" observed the planter. ^ "They'll find it equally as warm," said Jasper. "An a leetle warmer, tu, if I reckon right!" said Snipe, coolly. "Wait         t till the tarnal critters cum up!"  "If they succeed in coming in to-night," said the planter, ': our chances of standing a siege are slim. The fort is scarcely half finished!" This appeared to be the impression of the officers around the flag staff; for as Somers spoke, word was given ordering all hands' to the unfinished walls. In a few hours, the fortress was pronounced tenable, and capable of stand- ing a siege. The guns in the embrasures were clarged and rammed home, and the gunners stood ready to salute the enemy at a moment's warning. But the fleet which ere while threatened to ride so gallantly into port, now. lay tossing in the offing, unable to tt over the bar. By and bye it was evi- dent the vessels would not be ablAo conm to anchorage that day, if indeed they should succeed in making it at all.  As hour after hour passed away, and the fleet lay helpless in the oing, the confidence of the soldiers in the fortress, and of the inhabitants in the city,  who had been watching its movements with unflagging interest, returned: and all felt satisfied that ample time would be had to prepare for the struggle  ere it came.     bt4 ;   *   TR1E S'WAMP STEa-D; QR THE DAYS "They will not be up before to-morrow, if they should then," said colonel I; Moultrie.  "Meanwhile," observed captain Marion, " we shall have tiIfe to get every- thing in readiness to receive them." ' Night is falling, gentlemen," continued Moultrie, turning to lis officers * "bid your men to rest, for the probability is they will have a trying time of it to-morrow." The officers bowed, and set off, each in the direction of his men. la another hour, the sentries were keeping their lonely watch.; the fortress was silent, and the four hundred soldiers within its walls were wrapt in calm re- pose. The night passed away, morning came, and the fort was again alive with  the tread of armed men: and again, as on the preceding day, the embrasures in the battlements were black with bristling cannon.  "The fleet has gained ground during the night," said the planter to Nat  the woodsman.                              :: "Trev," observed the latter; "an' of I know anything of, the weather, they'll hev wilnd enff bimeby to work 'em in; an' they wunt hev tu wait , long nuther." As if to prove the truth of the woodsman's observation, the wind within a few minutes freshened, the sails began to fill, and the fleet moved slowly into port; and in less than two hours there appeared moving up the channel, two frigates of fifty guns each; five of twenty-eight each, one of twenty-six guns, and a bomb vessel. The men in the fort were eager to begin the combat; every face was flush- ed with a desire to convince the red coats and blue jackets that the courage, at least, was not all one side. The excitement in the city was intense; All the rebel troops that could be mustered were under arms, and prepared for battle. Numerous specta-  tors lined the shores and streets and covered the tops of the buildinos. Not a  spot was unoccupied where could be had a view of the combat which all fore- saw was now about to open.  At length, the fleet drew up abreast of the fort, and made preparations for battle. "Captain Marion," said Moultrie, "bid your gunners direct their pieces at the commodore's ship-let the fifty gun frigates be attended to first-we can settle the smaller ones afterward." "Aye, aye, sir!" answered the other, turning off to where his commant  was stationed, and giving the necessary order. At this moment a line of flashing lilht broke from the side of th e commo- dore's ship, then a lengthened range of wlite curling smoke, and this was  followed by a loud, deafening crash, which seemed to shake the very ele- ments. "Now, then, Somers, now then, sweep that rascal's deck, in return. Fi e!" cried Marion. Neil paused a moment, adjusted his gun to a proper level, and then step- ping back applied the match. Scarcely had the smoke died away, when a frightful scattering of limbs and plankingl on board the commodore's ship told how accurate and deadly had been the planter's aim.  "W;ell done!" cried Marion, applaudigly. "Now then, Macdonald," he added, running to another gunner, at the next embrasure, remember our powder and lall are short. Every shot must tell! Is your gun in rang(e-  aim accurate? Then, in God's name, fire! Bravo Their goes their man-  mast! Well done, Macdonald, my boy-well done l" Down went the commodore's mainmast with a frightfil crash, and the commodore with it.     "Ho, there!" cried a tall, angular figure sp!lning boldly on top of the parapet, in sight and range of the whole fleet, "I'm goin' to give one of yew fellers a rich lick?" And in another moment he had brought his rifle to his shoulder, and with iLrt quick and apparently natural motion peculiar to riflemen of the frontiers took a deliberate aim, and fired; then pausing monet to watch the ierct of his shot, he sprang back among the gunners, on the platform, apparently very well satisfied with the result of his performance. "I knew sum of 'em would smell pisen whllen Peter barked l" cried tile frontiersman, with a quiet chuckle, as he coolly set to work to recharge his rifle. "Once is enough for that kind of work, Snipe!" cred Marion, applaud- ingly. "I cannot afford to lose so brave a soldier thus early in the action, Hark! the murderous devils are hurling all their guns aainst us. Let them blaze away; our palmetto logs receive their balls, but throw no splint ers! Now, then, Somers, my oallant friend, is that aim yo are taking true--be careful, we cannot aflbrd to lose a single ounce of powder Ha I Bravo I that was an aim, indeed. With such shots as tlat, e 'll hardl leave eno ugh of the blue jackets and red coats to carry back then  of their de feat!"  "Hallo, thar'l" cried Snipe, the frontiersman, to a gunner, "while you're loadin' that feller for another bark, jes' let me pepper one on the varmint with my Peter!" And deliberately stooping down, he put his head and shoulders through the embrasure, raised and sighted his rifle, and then pulled its trigger. (I dropped an ossifer that time!" he exclaimed, coolly drawing back, to make room for the gun which was at that instant wheeled into its place, and a few moments afterward successfully discharged. At this period of the combat, the air shook with the deafening peals echo- ing from the fleet as well as from the fort; and there being but little or no wind, the smoke was -so thick and suffocating as to become a very serious annoyance. 'Nevertheless, both parties felt the necessity of continuing the action, though from different causes;. the fleet from that bull-dog motive which insists upon forcing its enemy to submission, the fort from that pecu- liar obstinacy which will knuckle to nothing short of utter annihilation. Thus far the dead and wou'nded on the decks of the fleet were frightfully numerous, while in the fort hardly a man was wounded. The firing gradually fell off, so as to give the smoke an opportunity to partially pass off, and was then resumed with unfla gging severity by both parties. "Don't fire a shot that is not bound to tell!" cried Marion, running from gunner to gunner, and everywhere arousing them to eagerness, coolnesg and caution. 'Let them fire away their ammunition-ours is too precious I Re- member that on every shot hangs the destiny of our country I Are your aims tnel? Fire, then!" And thus, he flew from gun to gun, cheering, warning and encouraging his men. A   manl on the top of the parapet attracted his 'attention. It was Snipe, the frontiersman, coolly picking up, one after another, a number of rifles which he had collected, and firing them at the enemy. "Come down," cried Marion. "Come down, sir, at once. A re yqu mad  rome down, sir!"' "Can't du it, captin!" cried the frontiersman, "this is the only place where I kin see!" "Come down, sir, at once!" cried the officer, authoritatively. "In a minit, capting!" cried Snipe, coolly. -'I've only got a couple of more left. I'd like to make 'em all tell 1" Nor did he descend to the platform till he had fired off every gun.     6        THLE SWMrP STEEDn OI TIE DAYS Then going up to the olfficer, whllo could scarcely preserve his gravity, he said- "I hope, capting ycr aint agoin' to chizzlo a feller out of his chances.  There aint such a nuther spot to fire from in the hull lort. Come up, an' see!" "Nonsense, sir " answered Marion, with assumed anger,. 'Tis a reck- less and useless disregard of human life to which I will not conscnt" "Blut consider, capting "                      [ 'Ait ' Silcnce, sir!" returned Marion. "Your conduct deserves to be reported  to ihe colonel, sir, and- " "Look, capting, look!" cried Snipes, interrupting him.  Marion turned his eyes in the direction pointed out by the frontiersman, i  and beheld the flag, which a chance shot from the fleet had wrested from  the staff, falling over the fortress. A loud shout from the fleet followed its descent. "The rebels have struck " was the cry, passing from lip to lip, on board  the vessels. A groan went up from the multitude in the city. "The flag is struck! Our brave defenders have ceased to struggle. Al is lost!" was murmured on every hand. Both parties were, happily, mistaken. Marion turned from gunner to gun- ner, with an imploring look; at length his eye met that-of Jasper, who was  in the act of drawing back previous to firing his piece. The sergeant, wrapt up in the management of his gun, had heard nothing of the fate of the flag, and was therefore somewhat astonished at the loud rejoicing of the vessel's crews. "Perhaps they are cheering at the arrival of a reinforcement, and counting on our capture now as certain. But they won't find that quite so easy. The old fort will swallow without flinching all the iron pills they can send it!" It was at this moment his eye encountered that of Marion. The latter seeing the sergeant did not understand the position of matters, pointed slowly and significantly to the shattered flag staf. An instant was all the young man required to comprehend everything; in another his mind was made up as to what course to pursue.  "Take my place at the gun,' he said to Marion, " and give those red coat rascals a settler for their insolence. I'll be back in a moment" . So saying, he sprang with the agility of a cat up on the. ramparts, where lie paused an instant to notice where the flag had fallen; then throwing him- self from the wall, he landed safely on the sandy beach, within a step of where it lay fluttering in the wind. At this instant, a ball, levelled at him from the admirals frigate, passed between him and the banner. With a laugh and gesture of defiance at the foe, he picked up the ensign, and waving it thrice in the face of the enemy, who could not restrain a cry of admiration at his intrepidity, he sprang up to an embrasure in the wall; and shortly afterwards was seen climbing the flag-staff, holding in one hand the ensign, which he coolly re-fastened to the pole, while a perfect shower of bullets whistled past, without touching either himself or the flag, whioh again waved gallantly in the breeze, and as before flaunted its defiance to the foe. The gallant sergeant now descended to .the platform, amid the enthusiastic acclamations of all within the fortress who had witnessed the gallant feat, and returned to his commander, saying modestly- "I will now relieve you, sir, and return to my gun." "You are the hero of to-day!" exclaimied Marion. seizing and pressing his hand warmly. '; And your country will not forget you "   OF MARION A'inD HS ItME; iRY  tME.      67 The sergeant blushed modestly, and silently resumed the management of his gun. The red coats and blue jackets on board the fleet were amazed at the ob- stinacy of the fort; nor did they comprehend how its defenders could hope for aught but defeat and destruction against a force so large and dispropor- tioned as their own. Fortunately this idea did not pervade the gallat party in the fortress, who felt perfectly satisfied, that if their ammunitioz15hld out, triumph must, at the close of the battle, be theirs. Ond gun in particular, had, from the beginning of the combat, caused a great deal of annoyance to the frigates of the fleet. It was the thirty-two pounder under the management of the planter. This gun appeared to divide its favors equally between the two leading vessels, and seemed determined that neither should have any well grounded right to complain of partiality. It tore and raked both with a precision and fatality of aim which spoke well for the genius of its workers. Now its rage appeared fixed on one, then it suddenly changed to the other; and each of its well directed messengers was a sure death-usher to all at whom it was directed. It appeared to have no particular place of aim; but wandered about wherever a group was congre-  gated. Its especial wrath seemed fixed upon the officers; no two of whom could be seen together for a moment, without one or both paying the next moment the penalty of their rashness. All on board the two' frigates felt the necessity of silencing a gun which made such frightful havoc, and every energy was thrown out for that purpose. But it was of no avail. The big  thirty-two blazed away, with the same regularity in time, the same accuracy of aim, and the same fatality in effect. An officer who had been watching it for some minutes, and noting the havoc it made among his men and the des- truction it caused to his vessel, determined at length to silence it. Stepping up to a gunner he pushed him aside, saying- "Away, and let me put an end to that fellow 1" He stooped to poise the piece, aud at that instant a flash of light appeared at the nozzle of the big thirty two a small cloud of smoke careened up, a report followed-and the head of the officer rolled from his shoulders as  cleanly as if it had been severed by an axe I Fear seized upon the spectators of this frightful incident; and from that  moment all hope of quieting the big thirty-two, or of reducing the fort, was abandoned by the crew of the ill-fated frigate. "Heaven is with them, and against us!" they murmured; and thenceforth their guns were worked mechanically, and without the enthusiasm of battle to sustain them. Meanwhile the big thirty-two played away as if bent upon the utter des- truction of the frigatfs, leaving to the other guns of the fort the task of at- tending to the smaller vessels of the fleet "You work well," said Marion, approaching the planter. "The enemy  are evidently staggered at your thirty-two pounder.. See how wildly they "Let them show their heels, then," said Somers, as he deliberately sighted his gun at a group of five officers and fired.  "They'll be glad to do it ere long " oberved Marion, with a quiet smile, "if that is to be the price of their stay!" As he spoke, there was a momentary confusion on that part of the  frigate's deck at which the thirty-two had been set; this was followed by a scattering of limbs and fragments of wood; and then all was still. Of the five officers, but one remained to tell the story of his companions' fate I Tho rest lay broken, mangled and severed in a hundred pieces. "But what is the matter now?" demanded Marion, with a moody brow, as he noticed that the guns of the fortress were not so active in their dis" charges as before. o 1     68        THE SWAMP STEEDP O0   THE DAYS "The powder is gin out, I reckon!" observed the woodsman. "Perhaps!" returned the captain, uneasily; and he passed with a quick  step to the centre of the platform, where stood the commandant of tho fort, sweeping the bay with his spy-glass.  "We are on the eve of a victory, colonel," said Marion, hastily, " and yet  the guns work as if the men were half asleep!"  "Our powder is very low," answrered the commandant, with a sigh. "We  have left scarcely half a dozen charges to a gun!"  "Heaven! What is to be done?"  "I have despatched a messenger to Charleston for a fresl;supply,"  "And before it comes," said Marion, who could scarcely restrain his vex- ation, "our last charge will perhaps have been fired, and the fortress be in the o hands of the enemy!"                .     WTe must hope for the best, sir!" said the commandant, with an air of resignation. "I have an idea though that something might be done to avert the dangcr you speak of. Do you see that schooner lying off there by the creek?"  'Distinctly." "She is one of the royal transports, and no doubt well provided with  powder. Thirty brave fellows might board her successfully, and-"  "I understand you," interrupted Marion. "It shall be done. Not a moment is to be lost. I will collect the men and start at once." The commandant replied to him by a look replete with gratitude and thanks, and Marion moved away to make his preparations.  He first ordered three boats to be held in readiness, then selected his men, and then calling sergeants Jasper and Macdonald from their guns, he led the way to where Neil Somers and Nat the woodsman were doing such terrible execution with their big thirty-two. "Gentlemen," said Marion, "I desire your company in an expedition on which I am about to enter, and wish you to yield your gun to these two officers, who will attend to it during your absence." The planter and woodsman bowed and stepped aside, while Jasper and Macdonald took their places at the gun. "I need not tell you, sirs," said Marion, to the sergeants, " tiat this gun must neither falter nor lose one jot of the position it has occupied during the action. You shall be supplied with powder, even if the rest of tho pieces have to lie idle. I will speak to the colonel to that effect, and I shall look on my return for a good report of your conduct in my absence 1" "The character of the gun shall not suffer in our hands, sir!" said Mac- donald proudly. "You may rest easy on that score, sir!" added Jasper. "I have every confidence in you, gentlemen," said Marion, flatteringly. "Come, sirs," he added, addressing the planter and woodsman, "we must be  on our way!" they left the spot and passed to the commandant, to whom Marion briefly recommended the propriety of furnishing the thirty-two pounder with a suffi- ciency of ammunition and then descended from the platform to the beaoh, where they found the boats and men in waiting. "Gentlemen," said Marion, "the object of this expedition is to obtain a supply of powder; and that schooner you see lying yonder near the creek must furnish it. There are thirty of you; divide off in sets of ten each, and then embark. Do you understand me, gentlemen?" The men made no reply, but did as he instructed them, and that with a cheerIfUless' and alacrity which showed how eager they were to enter upon the enterprise for which their commander had selected them. Jest as I 'spected 1" murmured the observant woodsman. "They obey the cap'n without stol'pin' to think or talk, 'cause they've got conaflence in   OF MArION AND 1"S M6E9 iMN.          G9 him.

Now for plan!" And he unfolded it to them in a whisper. When he had finished, he said: "Now, then, sirs, get aboard. We have not a moment to lose!" In a few minutes they were three hundred yards from the island, and with- a fifty of the schooner. They then divided off one making for the stern ot Jae vessel, another for the side, and a third for the bow. Fortunately, for the success of the expedition, the parties on board the schooner were all assembled on the port side, watching with eager interest the progress of the action between the fortress and the fleet; while the boats approached the vessel on its starboard side. Marion's pinnace shot towards the bow, the planter's towards the side, the woodsman's towards the stern. The captain's passed around the bow to the port side, and came' in sight of the parties on board the schooner who were somewhat staggered at the suddenness of their appearance. "Good day, sirs," said Marion, doffing his chapeau with a quiet smile. They are having quite a warm time of it, down there! Why don't you go and Join 'em?" "Who are you, sir?" said the commander of the schooner, with a con- temptuous glance. "I am, sir," returned Marion, calmly, "the monarch of these waters, as George is monarch of all above the shore; and I am come to demand the tribute which you owe me for invading and occupying this part of my realm." This was said in-a tone and accompanied with a look which fully persuaded the commandant of the schooner, as well as his men, that the master of the pinnace was either a madman or a fool. "Friend," said the commandant, "you had better carnryyoursolf and jests to another market."                   s  a "What I without my tribute? I couldn' think of it, sir! I am not in  the habit of allowing strangers to occupy my grounds without paying for tie privilege. You really must cash up!" "And pray, most potent monarch of the sea!" said the commandant with a derisive smile, "what is the amount of your exaction? Shall I pay it in guineas or in stripes? Will your majesty have it now, or wait till it suits your debtor to pay it?" "Si'," returned the other, with an air of mock deference, "I will have it now   " "Don't you wish you may et it?" asked the commandant. "I certainly do!"  "Then," continued the commandant, "will your majesty have the good- ness to colne iaboard and obtain it?" "Iost certainly 1" answered Marion. "Comrades," he added, "we must humor this gentleman, since he will not humor us. lie will not hand over the tribute; we must therefore go aboard and take it!" But your majesty," continued the commandant, in the same strain of mockery, "will first throw your arms overboard, and order your followers to do the same I'- "Not at all, sir 1" was the reply. "Then, your majesty," resumed the commandant, "I shall be under the necessity of sinking you 1" "Oh  !" cried the other, with an air of affected alarm, "you are jesting, IOW!"                                         i La-P1     70        -3  g 8WA VP STEED OR O THE DAYS  "Not t all," answered the commandant.; "and I give your majesty thirty  seconds to either throw your etapons into the sea, or move off altogether." "You are positively cruel 1" observed the captain, with an air of astonish-  ment and fear.                              - "Come, your majesty-decide!" said the commandant, in a tone that made j his already laugling followers nearly shake themselves to pieces. "But"-stammered the captain, with an affected cry, you will not mur- ! der a man for calling for his own I What will you do at the end of the thirty seconds?"  "Order my men to bring their guns to bear upon you." "Oh, don't-don't do that /" said the captain, with an affiectation of alarm . which was perfectly ludicrous. "Come, come-time flies!"  "But," cried the captain, whiningly, "where are your guns? I don't see 'em i"' "I'll show you!" answered the commandant, turning to his men, and giv- ing them a sign. The latter ceased their mirth, and wheeled around to seize their guns. As they turned they suddenly uttered a loud cry. "What's the matter now?" demanded the commandant, wheeling about in surprise. As he did so, he started, and became pale.          : And with reason; for before him, raned in a line, with muskets raised and levelled, were twenty men, awaiting their commander's order to fire I It was the two boat's crews, who, while Marion so adroitly rounded the bow and arrested the attention of the commandant and his men, had scaled the vessel's side and stern, and, unperceived, made themselves masters of the arm-chest, containing the weapons of the schooner. This was a tableau for which the commandant was scarcely prepared, and for a few moments his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and his cheeks assumed the paleness of marble. He was a brave man, however, and his self-possession speedily returned. An instant was sufficient to enable him to comprehend the details of the stratagem, as well as to satisfy him that he had been playing a game of sharps with one who was his master. By this time Marion and his crew had sprung from their boat to the schooner's deck, and drawn up in a line behind that formed by the joint crews of the planter and backwoodsman. "Well, sir," said Marion to the commandant, "you look as if you had thought better of it! You will now give us a little longer time to move off will you not?" The commandant was speechless, but collected. "Come, sir," continued Marion, somewhat impatiently, "find your tongue as speedily as possible. I am in haste. Where is your powder? "You have succeeded in surprising, but you have not yet conquered me " answered the commandant. "If you Want my powder, find it" "Young man," said Marion, sternly, "I respect your courage, but not your obstinacy. It was your obstinacy that spoke then, and it is mine which an- swers it now. I must know where your powder is " "Find it, then l" answered the other, fiercely. , "Beware, sir," said Marion, his brow darkening as he spoke; "It will not be well fbr you, if you drive me to extremities. I am in no humor to ut up with either your insolence or your bravado. Where is your powder? Find it!" returned the young commandant, haughtily. "Unless you tell it me, sir, and that instantly, I shall be compelled to resort to measures of a character destrue'ive to yourself a:d men, and unpleasant to me!"I "Do your worst t" "Then, sir-"  1   OP TARION AND HS MERRY   MEN,        71 'A momentl" cried-the planter, interrupting the storm which lie saw gathering and almost ready to burst. "A moment, captain I Perhaps the gentleman will not refuse to hearken to me i" "I give you two minutes, to ry him," said Marion, turning away towards the after part of the vessel. "Is that your answer, sir?' asked Somers, bending his eyes on the com- mandant in his calm, impressive way. "It is I" replied the latter, drawing himself up. "Pause, sir-reflectl" continued the planter, solemnly. "You are prison- ers, you and your men. The vessel and all it contains are no longer yours, nor under your control; on the contrary, they belong to us, their capturers. You are our prisoners; in our hands, and at our mercy. Why aggravateo your position, when a slight show of common politeness will soften it and restore you to liberty?" "You talk extravagantly, sir! Your prisoners, indeed 1"And the young man laughed mockingly, although it was very evident a true sense of his po- sition was gradually stealing over and forcing its due weight upon him. "Yes, sir, our prisoners. Can you deny it? Do you wish evidence of it other than what your eyes now furnish you? You are silent 'Tis well; but why then by your haughtiness attenpt to play a part so foreign to that of a prisoner? What is there prevents us, your conquerors, from using the rights of -capturers. We are enemies; you the weaker, we the stronger power; you haughty and defiant, we equally as proud and daring; you unarmed, we with the weapons of death at our shoulders, our eyes upon the sights, our fingers on the triggers I And yet we are forbearing! Pause, sir --reflect!" "I have spoken, sir 1" said the young man, haughtily. "For yourself, yes-for your men, no I It is not your own fate alone you pronounce, but that of your crew! As you speak, so must they abide. Your fate is theirs-if you die, so do they I Have you the right, in this your position, to sacrifice their lives, even if determined to throw away your own? I will not insult you, sir, nor tempt them, by offering to treat with your men " This last appeal touched the commandant; a momentary struggle with his pride, and all was over: he yielded. "Sir!" he replied, in a voice, tinctured with emotion, "you are right. I admit your premises and your Conclusions. I am your prisoner. What is your wish?" "That you deliver up your ammunition." "Mr. Whitehurst," said the commandant, turning to his first lieutenant "take a gang of men with you to the magazine, and bring up the powder 1" "Yes, sir," answered the lieutenant, touching his hat. Then selecting fodr or five of the crew, he passed through the lines, to the cabin, down the steps of which he disappeared. In a few minutes, the lieutenant and his gang returned, the latter bear- ing between them the powder, which, at a signal from their commander, they transferred to Marion's troupe, who at once passed it into the boats. "All is right, sir," observed Somers. a Having accomplished the olject of our visit, we shall now restore you to liberty, and then take our leave. Aboard, comrades, aboard 1" he added, turning to his men. "Our presence is needed at the Island." He sprang into his boat, as did the woodsman into his, as did Marion into his, each followed safely and quickly by his men. "But you are carrying off our armsl" cried the commandant leaning over the schooner's side.  "We have need of them!" replied Marion, rising, politely taking off his hat and making a very graceful tow. "We gave you your vessel and your lives; I,     72        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS be grateful for them. As for the muskets, we have not seen fit -to present you with them. Good dayl"I Curse you!" muttered the commandant, turing back passionately "Gentlemen," said Marion, "they are crying for us at te Island. Do you not hear them? Their cries are frightful 1"  All parties listened; and then they understood the captain. Every gun in the fortress was silent, except one-the big thirty-two I  The powder then had, at length, given out-the last round been discharged. One gun alone answered the fire of a whole fleet I Their souls were in labor. They looked at each other, and then at their leaders, whose brows were working with agony.  "Gve way " cried the woodsman. "Give way 1" continued the planter. "Give way!" concluded Marion. And yet no man could have recognized in either voice the natural tones of the speaker. The rowers fell to their oars with the energy of men whose hearts were in their hands; and the boats glided over the surface of the water with a speed which threatened to bring them quickly to the Island.  Meanwhile the discharges of the big thirty-twov became slower and more slow; and by the time the boats were within thirty yards of the shore, they at length ceased altogether. "Oh, men-men 1" cried the planter, half reproachfully. "The country-the country ' exclaimed Marion, with an imploring glance at his crew. "A strong pull, boys, if yew love liberty," groaned the woodsman, on whose bronzed brow cold sweat hung in large beads. The men answered by throwing every muscle into action; the oar-blades fairly quivered as they rose and fell in the current; and the boats shot towards the beach as if propelled by electricity. As it became understood through the fleet that the big thirty-two, which had created more annoyance and done more destruction than all the rest of the fortress's guns put together, had at length, either from injury or want ot ammunition, ceased its work, there uprose from the royal decks a sponta- neous shout of rejoicing which was heard far above the roar of battle. The prevailing supposition was that the defenders of the fortress were nearly if not wholly destroyed; a' supposition which was strengthened by the silence that answered the discharges of their guns, and the apparent loneliness of the embrasures, at none of which could the glasses of the enemy discover a sin- gle man; and many of the smaller vessels immediately bore in closer to the Island, and threw themselves abreast of the fortress, for the purpose of de- molishing it, and of burying its suirvivors, if there were any, in its ruins. Thus they were, in their own opinion, about to crush in its very bud the stronghold of rebellion, and, by making an example of the leading and most daring traitors, teach a lesson in the name of God and the king, that the people would not very soon forget. What then was their terror arid confusion, as they were about to open a destroying fire, and what the pleasure of the inhabitants of the city, who had given up all for lost, to see the embrasures of the fortress once more flashing with flame, its walls once again half obscured by white curling clouds, and  to hear the whole atmospheric vault trembling with its simultaneous and  deafning discharges  For a brief season, they were spell-bound with astonishment; meanwhile the grape and ball of the fortress were tearing them in pieces. Officers and men were falling on every hand, and the vessels themselves rapidly yielding tQ the destructive fire of tho fort. It was evident this could not last, far   OF PMAION AND 1"S mEs RY MEN.         73 any length of time without a most frightful loss to the fleet, and in the end, to its total destruction. The rebels, it was very plain, had no intention of yielding; and the pcu* liarity of the palmetto wood out of which the fortress was constructed, pre- served them, in a great degree, from the fire of the foe. Meanwhile, the big thirty-two was sending its souvenirs to the two frigates alternately, each ball considerately lessening the numerical force of their officers and men, and making such havoc on their decks as to render it highly probable nothing Would shortly be left of cither. By this time the ammunition looked for from the city, had also arrived, and everybody in the fortress was in the highest spirits. "All we want now, Mr. Somers," cried sergeant Macdonald, exultingly, rwhose gun was next to the big thirty-two, "is a fair field, which we have got, and no favors, which the enemy certainly are not inclined to give *, and in two hours we'll riddle 'em so they -won't know in what country tey're in!" "That we will," answered the planter, laughingly. "By the time the ac- tion is over, they'll be glad to learn the most direct course to London!" ' My 'pinion ar'," said the scalp hunter, " the varnfint 'll be wilin' to go intu a nearer port!" "Let them go where they will," observed sergeant Jasper, whose gmn was next to Macdonald's, "they'll never have it to say we did not do our best to push 'em along 1" "Ah!" cried Macdonald, laughing, "if they will but remain where they are for a few hours, it won't make any difference what we did for 'em!" "Iron," observed the planter, with a meaning smile, "has a very quieting influence!" "It puts a feller asleep quicker 'n piscn or chain lightlin'!" said the woodsman. "It gives him the staggers, too!" laughed Jasper.  "Yes, the blind staggers 1" cried Macdonald, reeling. "' Ah, boys, I've got 'em, certain"!" And he staggered back from his gun, with the smile-ala-! how sickly, now Haccompanying his jest, still playing on his features. In an instant, the planter was at his side, and his arms outstretched to catch him as he fell. "How is it?" he cried, in a voice of emotion; "how is it, Macdonald? Cheer up, brave heart-cheer up I Ho, there," he cried to a soldier who was approaching, "brandy-quick 1" The wounded sergeant shook his head, faintly.  "No use 1" he murmured, with a faint smile. "I've got my passport         ^ Water ' I  A moist sponge was applied to his lips. "Let me take you down to the surgeon," said Somers, soothingly. "No-no 1" cried the sergeant, faintly.

"Oh, Macdonald--Macdonald t" cried a voice, near him. It wai that of Marion, who, having been notified of the sad event, now approached hastily and took his hand. "Don't weep for me, captain " murmured the sergeant, faintly. "Don't weep for me, comrades, till the battle 's over. Then take me home--do you hear?-home, and tell my father and mother their boy-their Jack-died in the harness of battle, fightig-for-his--country! Tell thim that--will you?"

"Good bye captain!" murmured the dying man, struggling, and reaching out his hands, which trembled spasmodically. "Hni going-good bye, comrades. I'm on my long journey-dying-but don't let the cause of freedom die with me 1" At this moment, a loud shout from the fort rang on the air, and reached his quick, vibrating ears. , "What's that?" he cried, half raising himself, with a stern, superhuman effort. "The enemy are slipping their cables, and moving off. The victory is oursl" whispered a voice in the car of Marion. The dying sergeant overheard it; and in an instant a thrill of joy shot through his frame. With a last convulsive movement he sprang to his feet, and while his countenance shone with an indescribable extacy, ihe ex- claimed- "Huzza-huzza I Freedom forever I Huzza! huzza huz-." He did not complete the word; an invisible power arrested it on his lips. Marion and the planter lowered him gently on the floor of the platform, and applied a sponge moistened with brandy to his lips. But there was no action of nature in response. The spirit of the brave sergeant had taken its last farewell of earth, and passed away forever! CHAPTER X TaE news of the patriots' victory ran through the colony like wildfire. The loyalists were lost in astonishment. The republicans were thrown into enthusiasm. Men, women and children partook of the general joy; fear of the royal cohorts melted into a consciousness of their own strength. The clouds were pierced, broken and scattered by the bright rays of Hope for Young America. The tories scarcely knew what to think or do; and they wisely resolved to wait and see how the king would bear the intelligence of his defeat. Richard Winter was one of these; and as his hopes of vengeance fell, he de- termined while the tide of his political strength as a loyalist was ebbing and returning, to make the best of his time and talents in other matters. One of the latter was the advancement of his private fortunes; and the means, mat- rimony. Accordingly, we find him, on the morning of a fine day in July, at the door of the wealthy Mrs. Brunton's. He knocked, and was shown into thi drawing room. The beauty of the fair widow had attracted him; but her wealth'had done more-it fascinated him. Let us, however, do him the justice to say he loved the lady for her own sake to an extent that would have induced him, if she were poor, to woo her for his mistress; but the case being reversed, to make her his wife. Richard Winter had been in the drawing room but a few minutes wien Mrs. Brunton made her appearance. She was dressed as she always was- for a conquest; but without any idea of taking any other advantage of her triumph, than to enhance a reputation already famous for its victories. She received him with her usual politeness; that is to say, with the same con- sideration she would have shown to'any gentleman of her acquaintance Mrs. Brunton understood the general motives which brought her visitor to her house, and was gifted with sufficient penetration to guage the depths of Ais sincerity. She understood her guest in this respect, better perhaps than   OrP EAZION AND IIY9 MERnY nraEN.       75t he understood himself; and was fully prepared to appreciate all he might have to say relative to the object for which he had honored her with his call. You are really charning to-day, madam ' hle said, as the ilitiatory sal- utations on both sides passed away. "Indeed!" answered the widow, with one of her killing smiles. That is a compliment, coming from you who are so seldom guilty of giving one to any body." n And therefore the more sincere I I never flatter except when i is de- served!" / "Really I I deserve it, then?" "Most certainly. Are you not positively beautiful?" "I presume it must' be so," answered Mrs. Brunton, with a low, clear laugh, "for they all tell me so!" "You speak as if you rated me with the common flatterers, who ever hang upon the footsteps of beauty."  "Oh, dear, no; far from it. I have never considered you as a conmnon flatterer. Quite the reverse, I assure you!" said the widow, with a torment- ing smile, strongly blended with maliciousness. "You mean something?" "Certainly. I wish to provoke you into an argument." "With all my heart. With so fair an antagonist I'd argue a point till doomsday. Come, begin!" "You say I'm charming?" "And I'll maintain it." "Stop-stop--stop!" -cried Mrs. Brunton, playfully raising her finger. You say I'm charming, and that therefore I deserve the compliment of being told so." "Well?" "Is that your position?' "Certainly." "And do you dream of maintaining it?" "Against all the world!" "Oh, shocking creature I Why, I could bring a hundred men, collected in- discrimiinately, each one of whom would laugh at you for taking it." "He'd answer for his impudence, then 1"  "Not at all!" observed the widow, maliciously. "How,? You doubt my earnestness in advancing the sentiment, and my ability to defend. it?" "Your earnestness, no; your ability to defend it, yes!" "Really, madam, you are very provoking. Show me wherein my position Ls untenable." "Listen1 then, Beauty is not a merit, but-an accidental qualification." "Granted." "Then why compliment it? Nothing should be flattered, that is to say commended, unless it be a merit, which beauty, being an accidental qualifi- cation, is not." "Nay, it is!" "'A merit?"                / "Yes." "You shock me!"  "Still, I say-a merit!" "Your assurance amazes me 1" "It does? Hear me then, in justification. Beauty is one of the attn- butes of angels. God gave it them to make them perfect, as He did Truth and Purity, of which it is the Twin Sister ' and it is the three united which make them angels-that is to say, inhabitants of heaven.

The widow paid no attention to it however, but went on as if utterly un- conscious of her rudeness. "Oh, I'll wager now, I can tell the bush from which you plucked you sen-  timental flower." "Go on, then, madam," said Richard Winter, with a gloomy smile.    sOur( "You have been to church. of late, a rare thing for you who regard reli-  sh. gion so lightly--nd retained in your memory one of the dreamy fancies of   sn the minister 1" Winter shook his head slowly. "Wrong? Then you have been down to Charleston since the battle."  "What would that prove?" "Say rather what would it not prove?

How do I know your    if speech is not one of them? It is very much in his style 1"  "Reall she is very provoking I "muttered Winter, in an under tone "To  fath whom do you allude, madam?" he said, aloud.      a To whom but your old friend!"           '  "That leaves me in the dark as much as ever. I have many old friends. To which of them do you refer?"?, "To him who is most eminent for his merits."                :.n "'h! I understand you, now-you mean his excellency, the governor?"    ' "Notatall. He is eminent for his position only. I never heard that he had any particular meit. Besides, he would not be likely to be engaged  in making gratulatory addresses.

But, patience when herself  mail and property are mine, I'll .make her wince for this "He cleared up his    do brow, and assuming one of his most suave smiles, said aloud: "Will you con-  I  tinue to torment me, fair lady, by baffling my every effort to learn whom you hint at? Pray give me some generous clue." "Pshaw You are very stupid! Who can I mean but him whose name is the synonime of honor, heroism and genius; to whom but him, who when lie speaks, charms every car by the music of his tones ard the grandeur of his  sentiments; to whom but him who when he speaks drives from the bosonls of   S his auditors every baser feeling, and fills them with 'emotions grand ad   she noble as his own!" "Ah! madatm," said Winter ironically, " it has not been my lot to come in stea contact wtith one of such superior attainments! You speak as if among my   na friends I counted a demi-god." "I speak of one," said Mrs. Brunton, perfectly apprehending the jealous t  character of her companion, "whose fame as a soldier is on every lip; whose  thy genius as an orator is the theme of every payty; whose virtues as a man hlave elevated him above the reach of malice, which ever springs from envy; I    Anr speak of the orator of Kingstree grlen, and the hero of Fort Sullivan's rreat sist gun; I speak of your old neighbor, and sometime friend: Neil Somers 1' Richard Winter's countenance was livid in an instant.

" Really I Mr. Winter, I didn't think it of you I" This was said with an air of such mingled astonishment and ridicule that ncr companion coRld scarlcely contain himself. It appeared very eivident to him that it was the widow's intention to crush him; but whether playfully or in earnest, he could not decide. "I deny nothing," answered Richard Winter, venturing on a smile. " It would be the height of presumption in me to contradict a lady l But be as- sured of this; when I so far forget what is due to myself to borrow from one whom I regard as a mere noisy panderer to the mob, it will be when my senses have desrted me-not sooner I" Mrs. Brunton's eyes shone like a basilisk's. She could not hear the man she idolized spoken of thus, without rising to defend him. "You speak rather light of your sister's betrothed " she said, freezingly. "What would Amy say if she heard you talk thus ?" "He is not her betrothed, madam," returned Richard Winter, -" and, so help me heaven ! never shall be I I had rather see her in her shroud than the wife of so bold and insolent a rebel I" "You speak rather warmly upon the matter, 1Mr. Winter. Are those your father's sentiments?" asked the widow-, with an expression of calmness which was not at all in harmony with her feelings. " They are, madam I" Mrs. BrUtnton's heart nearly leapt from her breast with joy. "There is hope for'me I" she murmured. " Amy lost to him, what shall hinder his loving me! And Amy," she said aloud, "what will prevent her from becoming his wife, if she desires it ?" " Her father's cuwe, and mine 1" " Is that to be the price of her union with the man she loves ?" RichardsWinter bowed. " Really, you men are very cruel I" observed Mrs. Brunton in a tone of railery, for the purpose of drawing him out. "I don't know what I should do if I were in love, and had such a cruel father and so ungenerous a brother  I think I should be tempted to run away with my lover, in spite of' them 1" " And that, madam, is what Amy will never do I Love will never induce her to forget the filial duty she owes to the author of her being 1" "You are sure of that ?" "I am so certain of it, madam, that I would stake my life upon it I" This assurance sent a thrill of joy through Mrs. Brunton. "It was this I most desired to know I" she murmured.  ( Be not too sure," she said, aloud, while a smile, whiih Winter took for playfilness, illumined her features; "we woman are not so simple in our love affairs as you of the sterner sex arec apt to deem us I For the nian we love, we abandon father and motlther, brother and sister, and follow him to the end of the world. We say to the owner of our heart as Ruth said .to Naomi, ' Whither thou gooest I wvill go; where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God!'" "As Ruth said to her mother Naomi," replied Richard Winter, "so saith Amy to her father. Ruth was not more devoted in her filial love than my sister." "But," said Mrs. Brunton, determined on cornering him and discovering if there were nothing hidden and untold, as well as of learning if there were     78        TBlB SWAM?STEED ; OR TIM DAVS no coercive plan in view, and if not, of throwing out a hint for one, "there are times in woman's liibt when love is stronger than duty. In such hours, should the voice of the heart's idol be near, duty is forgot, love alone remem- be1re1d 1" ' I have thought of that," said Richard Winter, unsuspiciously, and made provision for it." "He falls into the snare!" murmnred Mrs. Brunton. "You astonish me i" she said aloud. "I am afraid I shall have to give you credit for superior ge- nius, too l" Winter smiled, gloomily. "It is our intention to wed her to another," -he said. "What-whether she will or no? That is cruel!" "Nay, she shall have a chance to like him first. 'Twill be an easy matter then, to her, and no cruelty in us." "That were a stroke of genius, indeed I Pray who is the party? He should be a good and amiable fellow to take the place in her affections of such a man as Somers. Who is he?" "Frederick Crampton." "Yu make me laugh!

"With my leave, indeed I what impudence When is the affair to come off?"      . "As soon as we can bring it about. It rests in the main with Crampton!" "With him! Thefaithless fellow! I'm vexed! Doyou know the wretch had the impudence to make love to me?" "Who, Crampton?" "Crampton I If it were not for the trouble, I might take a lady's privi- lege at this evidence of his faithlessness, and go off into hysterics 1" "How charmingly she pouts I' murmured Winter. "You take an interest in him, then?"' he said.            WI "Certainly; the same I feel in any poodle. He is too tender to go into rough company." "Which you consider-"^ "Yourself!" returned Mrs. Brunton. "With you he will soon lose his character." "Thank you!" said Winter, with a low ironic bow. "What character wil Mr. Crampton lose by associating with me?" "His puppyism! You are too matter-of-fact a personage not to impart enough of your manner to rub off his effeminacy. A little while in your so- ciety, and he will become somewhat of a man." "Ah! thank you, and thip time in earnest!" said Winter with a grateful bow. "All, lady," he added, with an air of genuine feeling, you have a rare talent!" "Indeed! I was not aware of it. For what?" "For throwing men first on a bush of flowers, then on another of thorns." "Flttering again!" said Mrs. Brunton, throwing up her forefinger archly. "Good!" murmured Winter, "I have made a point. That compliment makes her eyes sparkle. I must follow it up! Surely," he said aloud, you would not object to one's uttering a truth, simply because it might be pane- gyrical?" "Oh! no," answered the'widow, comprehending his thought; "to do thai would be to close the lips of my friends, who appear to visit me for no other purpose They take such liberties; why should not you?"

Flattery direct, though couched in ever such artful guise, is indelicate, because it seeks to captivate the senses. Ac-     i tions on the contrary appeal to our intelligence, and are reliable, if consistent Any gentleman may throw out a compliment; but only one in ten is able or  willing to attest his sincerity by a consistent series of appeals to our judg-    ' ' men." "How is a gentleman to show that he is sincere? Tell me by what course  of conduct: for I am anxious to evince mine!"                     j/ He blushed as he spoke; for he was conscious that he had blundered into what might be considered a declaration.  The widow saw his mis-step; but had no disposition to allow him to per- ceive it. "If that really were the case," she observed, "you would soon find a plan of action to enable you to demonstrate it!" "Foiled again " murmured Winter. "Every step I make, plunges me deeper than ever into the mire. I must recede There is no getting along with you," he said laughingly. "You are without mercy i" "You have no right to say so," returned Mrs. Brunton; "you have been acting on the offensive, without pausing for an instant, or asking for quarter. If you have not come off victor, attribute not the fault to me I'  "Nay," returned her companion, " in a game of sharps with you, fair lady, an antagonist is fortunate if he come 'off with even a show of life? But let us change the subject."'  "To what?"  "Amy's marriage with Crampton. You can assist us in bringing it about. Say you will"  "Why should I say that?" "Because it will advance her happiness." "Do you believe so?"  "Ultimately, yes," replied Winter, without shrinking from her piercing  gaze. "You are friendly to us all. Amy has confidence in your friendship as well as in your judgment. A timely word from you in Crampton's favor, might do much in hastening a match fraught with so much interest " "To me, O how muchl" murmured Mrs. Brunton. "I thought you said it depended altogether on Mr. Crampton," she observed. "So far as the urging of his suit was concerned, only. He is vain enough to suppose himself irresistible, and innocently fancies that when he makes a proposal, he will meet with no denial"  "But what if Amy were disposed to accept him?" "He would propose in an instant." "Are you confident of that?"  "Quite. Will you assist us?" "I'll think the matter over. I feel a deep interest in Amy's happinefs, and if I succeed in persuading myself that such a step would be for her wel- fare, I shall most assuredly do my best to urge it 1"  "Nay, it would," said Richard Winter earnestly. "Somers is a rebel,  and will, sooner or later, reach the rebel's award-the scaffold; for it is idle to  suppose t  that the king will brook this treasonable insolence of the people any longer than he can send over a few squadrons to punish them. When that day comes, and it must dome, what will be the fate of this ranter of Kingstrce greer? and what the fate of the creature unfortunata enough to become his       vife? It is to save Amy from such certain wretchedness that I would ally ier to one with whom she will have tranquility, if not happiness.'  "Solemn hypocrite t" muttered Mrs. Blunton. "Your logic is very good," she said, wit an air of apparent conviction, " and I see no good reason for not believing it to be correct." "Y1eou will assist us, then?" "Yes," returned the widow, thoughtfully. . "t Amy's happiness is dear to me; atlsppo   I suppoe I must " 'lhank you-thank you! I will now take my leave." "So soon?"

And the wolf dares aspire to a heart which beats alone for the lion! And shall he persist in his aspirations?

AnOUT three days subsequent to the incidents described in the preceding chapter,'a young man, of a slender but rather genteel figure, dressed with a great deal of care and a fair share of taste, might have been seen, about four o'clock ii the afternoon, walking leisurly along the Georgetown Road. There was that in his gendral deportment which pronounced him one of those who entertain a -very favorable opinion of themselves, and who innocently fancy that no one can look upon them without being impressed with a convietil  of their greatness.   OF MARION AND "S  miRRY. MEN.        81 It was, in fact) our old acquaintance, Frederick Crampton, on his way to the Winter plantation, to pay his respects to Miss Amy. "Some people," murmured the exquisite, conversing confidentially with himself, as he pasted along, "have a vewy poor ideah of the pre-requisites for making an impwession. I flattah myself I amn not one of that number. The fact is, there is nothing like a natuwal taste in such matters, which X flattah myself I have. It stwikes me it will not be vewy difficult to make an impwession on Miss Wintah, ff I bet about it. To be sure, I hav'nt made any vewy gweat pwogwess as yet; but that is because I have not laid my- self out to do so. To-day, howevah, I shall make an effort, and of course Miss Wintah will fnd it extwemely difficult to wesist me 1" With ideas like these, Mr. Frederick Crampton. pursued his way towards the Winter plantation. The atmosphere was very warm, and as the roadside was but poorly shaled, the exquisite, to avoid the heat of the sun, turned  off to the left and struck into a wood, leading, by a shorter routei to the place of his destination.  Once in the wood, his progress was rather slower than before, in conse- quence of a desire on his part to preserve' his garments from the slightest  contact with the timber. He had penetrated the sombre depths of the wood about three hundred yards, when he'suddenly found himself face to face with a magnificent coal black steed, whose large clear eyes were fixed upon him with an expression of surprise. The gallant animal was both saddled and bridled. He was young and spirited, superbly shaped, with a deep flowing mane, tapering legs and a long switch tail. He carried his head with the air of an Arabian and was in fact among horses, what Crampton was among men-an exquisite. Frederick Crampton, a capital judge of horseflesh, was stupefied with ad- miration-at the appearance of this noble animal, whose intelligence was writ- ten in its eye, and whose trustiness was evidenced in the fact that its owner had left it without a halter. The exquisite was for a time lost in astonishment at the animal's brilliant points, the magnificence of which he had never before seen equalled. His admiration soon gave way, however, to uneasinless, as the idea uprose in his mind that he had seen the animal on a previous occasion. There would have been nothing very alarming in this, which was after all merely an incident of memory, had it not been attended by another, viz: a remem- brance of the person of its owner. This was a phantom of the memory which the exquisite was far from pre- pared to encounter; for in that phantom hle recognized Ncil Somers, and in him a rival. Therefore-it was this which most troubled the exquisite-if his horse was here, saddled and bridled, it was more than likely the planter himself could not be far off. Worse still-so reasoned the exquisite-this road led to the Winter planta- tion, was in fact a part of that property, and one through which no one would be likely to pass unless for the purpose of reaching the house by a shorter route than the road. What then could Somers, who was on such un- friendly terms with the Winters, whose appearance on their threshold would be the signal of an insult, be doing in it? The exquisite grew uneasy as lie asked himself this question; for he felt satisfied there was but one member of the 'Winter household whose brow would not blacken into a froi'nl if the planter was known to set foot upon their grounds: and that person, that person-(the exquisite's lips became livid as he murmured it)-was the only one whose frown was worth the heeding, the only one whose smile was worth the having. "Demnition!' mut ared the exquisite, "my blood is getting 'uglyl If after I have taken so much twouble to wender myself agweeable, 1 should 10'     82        TIEM SWAD SWA ED; OR PTHE DAYS discover that Miss Wintah is in the habit of meeting that vulgah fellow, the  plantah, in the wood here, I think I should get vewy, vewy angwy I It is vewy stupid to do so, I admit, but there are situations when anger becomes' pwoper, vewy pwoper 1" He passed through the devious Windings of the wood, followed by the large staring eyes of the horse, till he came to a spot where the underbrush began to assume a rather dense character, through which, however, he was about to penetrate, when his footsteps were suddenly arrested by the sound of voices, which were familiar to his ear. "Deinnition!" he nurmured, cautiously drawing back a step pr two, and . seeking the fiiendly shelter of a huge palmetto. "They arc; here I If I had a wifie now, I think I should be tempted to blow the vulgah fellow's bwains out I But as I have no weapon, I pwesume I must make the best of it! I'll tell Wichard, though, about it, and see if his authority isn't stwong enough to p'ut a stop to these stolen interviews! 1 ere I'm paying my addwesses to Miss Wintah, and I detect her holding clandestine meetings with another. It is enough to make one swear. Demnition  if my mother heard of it, what would she say!"' And throwing his eyes cautiously through the underwood, in the direction of the voices, he beheld the planter and Miss Winter seated beside each other i on a mossy mound situated between two towering and broad-trunked trees. What rendered the scene more aggravating to the exquisite was the fact that the planter's right arm encircled his lovely companion's waist, the fingers 'of his left hand were interlaced in those of her right, while his shoulder served as a resting place for her brow. The exquisite's cheek, already pale, at sight of this, became absolutely livid.  His fingers involuntarily rolled in towards the palms and buried themselves  in the flesh. At the same moment a sense of his position came across him, and, fearful  of discovery, he moved slowly and noislessly'around to the rear of the huge palmetto, against which he leaned for support; for in truth, the scene we have just described had totally unnerved him. "It is shocking," he murmured, while a shade of agony swept across his forehead, "vewy shocking! I didn't expect it ofher! As for the plantah, there is something gathering here against him!" And he smote lis breast with a clenched but trembling hand. "I must leave this," he muttered, in a few moments, as his nerves became somewhat more tranquil: "it is vewy ungentlemanly to play the part of an eaves-dwopper. I should never forgive myself for such an outwage on pwo- pwiety, nevah. It would nevah do, nevah. I weally must go away!" But to do this, without being seen was, at the present stage, a feat more easily thought of than performed; for the lovers had now so changed their position as to have a full view of everything before them; and to the ex- quisite's horror, their faces were turned in the direction of the tree behind which he was crouching for concealment. He sighed, arid came to the conclusion that there was now no hope for him, and'that he must, however much against his inclination, become a list- ener'to the conversation of the lovers. To do him justice, the position in which he found himself was a source of great distress to the exquisite, who could not reconcile it as in any way be- coming, a gentleman, a character for which he had a most exalted respect, and one which he was very ambitious to sustain. To crown his wretchedness in this respect, he beheld the large black orbs of the intelligent swamp stee ststaring at him reproachfully through the trees. Had it been a human witness, the exquisite could not have felt the mortifying stigma of his situation more plainly. "I shall dwop diwectly 1" he murmured, wiping from his brow sweat that X   OP' MARION AND HS MERRY MEN..         83  cane leaping to its surface in large beads, "I know I shall; and then they will discover me, and I shall be disgwaced forever! If my mother were to see me, what would she say? Her heart would break with shame!"  Perceiving then that an attempt to escape frolm his embarrasing position  would, by leading to his exposure, result in plunging him into one still more humiliating, the exquisite resolved to remain where his ill stars had placed him, and bide the issue of events, man:animously determining at the same time, as a compromise with his nice sense of honor, to let his knowledge of this interview between thelovers, together with everything lie miglht over- hear, pass away into oblivion as though the one had never transpired, and the other never been spoken.  As he came to this honorable decision, the exquisite felt stealing over him a sensation of ease and tranquility which restored to him in a great meas- ure his former self respect. "My mother," he'murmured with a smile of unusal serenity, " would love me more than evah for this resolution I I can now listen to what my wival has to say without endangering my honorl" As if the spirit which had charge of his destiny was pleased with this in  stance of his noble nature, his self-possession was restored to him, and this was followed by a sense of security which, while it made him happy, he did not attempt to define.  Let us now turn to the lovers, who, while they conversed, were perfectly unconscious that other ears than their own were listening to what passed be- tween them. "Al, Neil," these were the first words, uttered in a voice of mournful  music, that came to the ear of the exquisite, " there is naught in store for us but misery" " "Nay, beloved," returned the planter, "let us not despond. Heaven has in its holy keeping hearts that truly love, and leads them in its own good time out of darkness up to light!"             -  "But, my father, Neil. His brow clouds whenever I speak to him of you I "He hates me, then?" "Alas! yes."                                     I "I never did him wrong!" "'Tis true. - And yet he hates you"  "Heaven pardon him for it as I do The cause?" "Are you not a rebel?" "And for that he hates me?"

And yet how much--Oh  heaven,  how much 1 has he given to me 1"  "And you hate him, Neil, do you not? anl with an enmity as fierce and        i deaidly as liis own?"                                 i' : "No, Amy, no. My heart is not large enongh to make room for animosity        [ against any living thing. I could not sleep with so base a spirit for my bedc- fellow! It is my ambition so to live that when I lay me down at night my soul 6ould say ' all's well!' in case it were to take its judgment flight before the morning!" "I like this fellow!" murmured the exquisite. "His heart is noble, it is gweat l"  "And has my brother no cause to fear you, Neil? Answer me truly. He did you a great wrong"!" "He did 1" returned the planter, whose cheek became ashy, " and yet I have not sought him!"     84        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS             L "But you will-" persisted Miss Winter, fixing her blue eyes on him with an expression of intense anxiety. "No," answered Somers, with an effort. "My country has need of me.  I am in her service now!"               -  "But tlhat cannot last, Neil! ' What cannot last?" returned Somers, absently. "'Tis true," said the planter, solemnly, "for God is coo merciful to give  oppression the upper hand, eternally 1" "  Ah, Neil, you are ungenerous You evade the answer I would have! "Drive me not to it, Amy!" said the planter, with emotion. "But rest  assured of this.

"Hear me, Amy  What need of anticipating woe? What grounds hav e you for supposing there is a possibility of our meeting?" "Because Richard has sworn it!" "Heaven help him! We may meet, and yet neither of us die. Such things, have happened, Amy!" said the planter with a quiet smile. "You will not kill him then, Neil; nor let,him kill you?"  "For your sake and my country's-no!"  "Ah  thank you-thank you! My heart is lighter now!" The planter smiled. "Listen," he said. " ichard is not so terrible as you think, nor as he himself believes. He is on the side of passion, which blinds its followers. and of error, which rarely ends in leading to their undoing all who trust in it. I were no man to let one who pursues so false a track, cheat me of my happiness, or rob me of my life. Be assured, sweej one, that while I will entrench on no one else's manor, I will most sacredly guard my own. I owe this to those who love me as well as to myself; and trust me, I am  versed enough in what is due to myself, to judge. by that of what is due my  friends. But tell me of this forced lover, sweet one -"  The exquisite pricked up his ears, which tingled as if on fire. "Does he persecute you," continued the planter. "Does he strive to win affections he knows are fixed upon another?" "Let me do him justice," returned Amy, unconscious of the friend she was making by her ingenious reply. "He has thus far conducted himself as be-  comes a gentleman. He has done'his best to render himself agreeable with- out insulting me by professions, which, if genuine, could not be returned. He has never even spoken to me of love, never uttered a sentiment not based upon the strictest sense of honor. "And nevah will!" murmured the exquisite, blushing in spite of himself. "rejoice to hear it," said the planter, "for his mother's sake, who is a very noble and worthy lady. I have known her for many years, both per- sonally and by reputation, and ever regarded her as one of the purest-minded and gentlest-hearted women on the list of my acquaintance, If she has a failing, it is perhaps a too great fondness for her son, whom she loves with all the energies of her soul I Her's is one of those noble spirits which, by their sweetness and amiability, win the love and admiration of all with whom they come in contact. Frederick could not be the son of such a lady, and not inherit a portion of her generous nature!" "                  . .   'OF MARION AND HlS MELREY MEN.          85 "Weally " mumurred the exquisite, from whom this panegyric on his parent drew tears of gratitude and joy, "I like this fellow! He is'a gentle- man, even if he is a webel!" "'Tis said he loves his mother with an affection equal to her own," ob- served Miss Winter. "I am glad to hear it," said Somers, " for she deserves his warmest devo- tion. Trust me, Amy, Mr. Crampton is worthy of our highest respect for all his drawing-room airs, so long as lie fails not in the duty and reverence lhe owes to his noble mother; and so persuaded am I that he will never be found wanting in aught thatis due to honor, that I dare trust him as the guardian  of the bright mistress of my soul, without a fear as to the result!" 'Have a care, Neil," said Miss Winter, archly. "The bright mistress of your soul might perchance be tempted to fieely tender him her heart!" "And she could inot ofilr it to a nobler, Amy. For, look you; take away the artificial dross which he has imposed upon himself, and the natural worth  of the man will show itself and command general admiration. And it could not well be otherwise, for his mother-his mother who nursed and trained  him-is one of those pure spirits who refine, redeem and elevate humanity. There are two sides to his character, as there are to every man's-his natural  and his artificial ones: it is the latter only he presents to our view, reserving  his first and noblest for her from whom he inherited it." The exquisite, naturally modest, blushed at this panegyric; and as there was nothing selfish in his disposition, he felt his heart gradually stealilng towards the planter, bound in the garments of good will. If he was natural- iy pleased to hear himself thuls spoken of, what must have been his delight on listening to the eulogy passed upon a parent whom he loved with an af- fection bordering on reverence? "I never gave him credit for much worth!" observed Miss Winter. "To tell the truth, I nei'er considered him in any other light than that of a vain, weak gentleman 1" The sensitive exquisite felt hurt at this remark, and his brow gathered into a moody frown. "I shall dwop my addwesses!" he muttered. "It is evident she does not  know how to appreciate me. I shall dislike her-I know I shall!" '"You do him injustice, Amy, Trust me, beneath his assumed effeminacy, there beats as true and noble a heart as any in Carolina!"  The exquisite's brow cleared up again. His eyes sparkled with pride and pleasure.  "You shall find it so, Mr. Somers," he murrmured, should you evra stand  in need of a fwcnd! I do not like to boast, but I do think my heart is not so vewy bad!" "And are you not afraid, Neil," asked Miss Winter, with an arch smile," to speak thus of one who aspires to be your rival?"  No," returned the planter, pleasantly. "I would not underrate his merits if I could. Besides," he added, tenderly, "were he to succeed in  displacing me in your heart, loved one, it would be an evidercec that, your love had not yet been won by me: for if it had, he could not be my rival with any prospect of defeating me, if he would!" "He could not, Neil!" said Miss Winter, feelingly.  "I believe it, Amy; and therefore am I easy.  Confident that Mr. Crampton will not employ dishonorable means to make you his, I have lno fear that he will supplant me." "He will never succeed in doing that, Neil!" said Miss Winter. "At least he will not twy!" murmured the exquisite, stealing a look of  admiration at Somers.  "I feel assured of that, loved one," said the planter.

By the Way, is t your brother's intention to engage actively in this war between the people and the king?" "Yes. Even now he is forming a small party of young mei, wild, vindic- tive and daring as himself, to harrass and persecute the patriots." "There are too many such bands," said the planter, mournfully; "and  worse than all, they are in the main composed of men born, like Richard, on the soil which they redden with the blood of their nobler countrymen I Ah  Amy, had we, that is the people, but half the arms'and money the royalists possess, we'd teach these marauders a lesson they would not soon forget. As it is, with all their superior advantages, they have not the courage to face us like brave men fighting in a just cause, but prowl upon our rear and shoot us down, fire our dwellings in the still houis of night, watch when we disperse, lay in ambush for us as we are returning alone to our homes, and slaughter us, bloodily, savagely!" "Demnition!" muttered the exquisite, indignantly. "A cause which tol-  erates such horwible cwimes as that, cannot be justl If I were to do such  things, what would my mother say!"' "And Richard," continued the planter, with an air of anguish impossible to describe, " is about to enter upon a career like this I 'Tis frightful!  These marauding gangs are chiefly composed of men whose natures and habits are more brutal than human; of men whose minds are perverted by prejudice, not guided by intelligence; of men in fine, who are so low in I the scale of humanity, that they have the heart, like born savages, whom they resemble, to fire men's dwellings while they sleep, and shoot clown and force back into the flames, men, women and children, as they endeavor to escape!" "Horror!" exclaimed Miss Wlinter, bowing her head, sobbingly, upon hisl shoulder.  "It is not only horwible," murmured Crampton, " it is infamousl What would my mother say if she heard it!" "I can easily conceive," pursued Somers, "how men half savage in their  natures can commit crinms, which men of a more elevated scale in humanity  would shudder at; but I cannot conceive how a man, like Richard, blessed with the lofty intelligence springing from education and habitual collision with persons of'iitellect and refinement, could deliberately descend from his present proud position, forego his standing as an educated and intelligent being, and associate with men whose barbarities stamp them akin to the brutal and the savage!" "Oh, pity me, Neil!" cried Miss Winter, whose azure eyes were stream- ing with tears, whose lute toned voice trembled with emotion, and whose general air was evincive of the depth of her humiliation, "this bad man is my brother!" her cheek, " and mourn for my country: for I can easily divine how fierce and terrible an enemy she will find in one who can bring a high order of in- telligence to assist him in his brutalities!"

"And," continued the planter, "it is because oppression is the friend of the rich, that it meets so many friends; and because feedom is the friend of the poor, that it meets with so few!" "The poor shall find otne fwend more!" muttered the exiquisite, "and, thank God I that fwend has a wich father, who though hIis feelings side with the king, yet shall part with a share of his money to help the people.

"And do you sec hope, I ," asked Miss Winter, earnestly, "in this con- test between the people and the king?"          i "Yes, loved one, yes," replied the planter, with an air of solemn grandeur which gave to his words a tone of prophecy, "for He is with us It may be He will lead us, as He did the Israelites of old, through long years of stern and bitter struggling, ere Victory shall perch upon our banner, and Defeat be enscrolled upon the standard of the crown. But in the end our faith and courage will prevail and Freedom's flag shall wave in glad triumph upon our mountains, and Freedom's hymn be sung throughlout our vales!" "God grant it " murmured his betrothed, gazing with a mingled expres sion of love and pride upon her enthusiastic lover. "Trust in Him!" said the planter, raising his eyes upward solemnly, "and he will carry us safely through the wilderness!" You are a noble fellowl" murmured the exquisite, "and have made a fwend to-day of one who will pwove himself a fivend. Oh, if my mother could but hear him speak!" At this moment the near report of a rifle rang through the wood, and was followed immediately after by a low groan. The lovers started up, but without separating; Amy clinglth in terror to her betrothed; the latter circling her waist with one arm and shading his eyes with the other as he peered around to discover from whencethe cry of anguish proceeded.  Oh, Neil!" cried the maiden in accents of deep distress, we are disco- rered!" "Hushl" returned Somers, in a-whisper. ' I thought I heard a groat., and a sound as of something fallingll"' "And I " said his companion. "Demnition 1" murmured the exquisite, "that was a bullet's whistle. Something horwible is going on, and not far oi; either!" "There is danger afoot!" said tht planter calmly, "and this, my, is not the place for you. Como, let me see you home!" "And you Neil?" returned the maiden, in a tone of deep affliction, "t you must not return!" ' "Nay, dearest," he answdred hurriedly, as if le had not heard her, "we have no time to lose. Come  ",!" And without giving her tine to reply, the planter took her by the hand, and gently hurried her, despite of her feeble resistance, from the spot, and past the exquisite, who hastily moved around the palmetto, as they approach- ed, to avoid detection. CHAPTER XII. "There are mors parties in the wood than there shcmld be!" muttered Crampton, uneasily;  "I am vewy much mistaken if tha':-noise did not mean something /    '1     88       - THE SWAMP STEED; OFR THE DAYS . As he spoke a moan fell on his ear, followed by a loud cry.  "Help-help  I am dying!" The exquisite started, and turned pale. "Who speaks?" he demanded, in a troubled voice, "Help-help!" repeated the unknown.  "Where are you?" cried the exquisite, striving, but in vain, to make out  from whence the voice proceeded.    i.' "Here-help, help!" moaned the unknown, feebly, and Crampton at once comprehended that it came from the lips of one whose earthly career was rapidly drawing to a close. "Something must be done!" he muttered, his natural generosity getting  the better of his caution. "Discovery or no discovery, I cannot leave the poor wetch to die!" So saying, he quitted the palmetto, made his way through the underwood, passed over the mound which had previously been occupied by the lovers, and after advancing some eight or ten yards beyond, suddenly came upon a  poor wretch distended upon the ground and writhing in great agony, in the midst of a large pool of blood which the spungy soil was gradually absorbing  In his right hand, the wounded man, whose face was turned towards the earth, grasped with convulsive tenacity a rifle which, judging by the position of its hammer, had been recently discharged.  The exquisite was for a few moments paralyzed with horror, at the sight. As he recovered his self-possession, he glanced at the dying man, at the weapon in his hand, and then at his proximity to the spot where, at the time  of the report which was sharp and quick like that of a rifle, sat the lovers unconscious of their danger, and a faint idea of the facts in the case flashed through his brain like a line of lightning. He had scarcely arrived at his conclusion, when he heard footsteps, then the rustling of cloth against dry and low-bending branches, and the next in- stant the planter was beside him. "Excuse me, sir," said Somers, " what know you of this?"And he pointed sternly to the wounded man, whose struggles, judging by their faintness,  were rapidly drawing to a close.  "Nothing, sir," replied Crampton, coloring, as he understood that he was regarded with suspicion. "I was merely passing through the 'wood, for the purpose of weachirig the Winters by a shorter woute than the woad, when my attention was attwacted by the weport of a wifle, followed by a cry for help. I pwoceeded in the diwection of the sound, and found this poor fellow stwuggling as you see him!" And you know nothing more, sir, of thl affair?" demanded the planter,  sternly. Nothing, on my honor!" responded the exquisite. laying his hand upon his breast, with an air which carried conviction of its truth. "Enough, Mr. Crampton," said the planter, changing his tone to one of  deep respect, "I believe you." Then dropping his eyes upon the rifle in the grasp of the prostrate man, he  exclaimed- "Ha! the piece is discharged. The poor wretch has been shot acciden- tally by his own weapon!" "So I suspected!" observed Crampton. "Assist me, sir," said the planter, stooping down and lifting the man out of the crimson pool. "We may yet save him!" So saying,'and with the help of the exquisite, he drew the man gently to- wards the base of a deep-trunked tree, around which the earth was compa- ratively free from brush; then dropping on one knee, he held the head in one arm, while with the other he removed the rifle from the hand of the dy- ing wretch, whose face was stained with blood, and whose eyes were turned   OF MarLION AND TIIS MERRY VMEEN.        89 up with an expression of horPor at the man who so generously assisted him. The exquisite shuddered, for from the wounded man's side, the red tide of life was slowly welling out. "How is it with you, sir?" asked the planter, with an air of deep sympa- thy, as Crampton, takingl his handkerchief, applied it to the wound to stop its effusion., "Ha!" exclaimed the man, shuddering; "that voice!  Mr. Somcrs? Speak-is it you, sir?" "Yes, my friend. 'Tis I; but what then?" A convulsive tremor darted through the man's frame, accompanied by a groan. "Speak, my friend!" said the planter, tenderly. "Can I do anythingforyou?" The man shook his head, and an expression of despair swept over his coun- tenance. "Nothing " he ejaculated, faintly; "nothing but pardon: for I was about to murder you!" "I thought so " muttered Crampton, shuddering withi horror. "For what, my friend!" said the planter. "I never injured you!" "True," said the man, speaking with difficulty; " but he employed me to creep in upon you, and shoot you down." "'He'! Whom do you mean? "Richard Winter 1" gasped the man, growing fainter and fainter. "But your gun went off?" "Yes, as I was raising it to my shoulder; a twig of the brushwood touch- ed the trigger, and the ball entered here!" And he pointed with a motion of his finger to his side. "God pardon you, my friend," said the planter, solemnly, ': as I do I ' 'Twas Richard Winter, then, who set you on to this?" Yes. He had seen you as you were entering the wood from the roadside; and suspecting that the motive which brought you here was to have an in- terview with his sister, he gave me twenty guineas and his rifle to watch and  shoot you." "Unhappy man!" said the planter. "What--hed a fellow creature's blood for twenty guineas!"  "I was poor," groaned the man, trembling with remorse and the approach of death, " without money, without work, and my family starving!" "Your name?" asked the planter. "Tom Churchill," gasped the man, whose voice had now approached to a. faint murmur. "'Par-pardon-O, par-"2 "I do-- do And if it will'be any consolation to you, I will see that your family be relieved from their necessities." A faint smile hovered for an instant at this announcement around the lips of the dying man. "You'll do that?" lie inquired, with a low cry. "I will, my friend, I will!" A shade of remorseful agony passed over the man's features. "And this," he muttered, with a frightful moan, " this is the man to kill whom I took the gold of an assassin!" "But I have said I pardon you, my friend!" "Yes," muttered the poor wretch faintly, "but God-- And a deep sigh escaped him. "He also will, I trust, forgive you 1" said the planter. But the man answered not-made no sign. For with that expression of remorse, with'that sigh of repentance, tt!o spirit of the poor wretch had taken its departure for that other world whero the Just sits in judagrment uopon crime. 12     90        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "'He is gone!" observed the exqusite with a shudder. "Yes," answered the planter. And he lowered the head of the dead man gently to the earth. There was now a long painful pause, during which the parties were each ab. sorbed in thought. At length, 'This is an unhappy business, Mr. Crampton," said the planter, "and one that will breed trouble. What now is to be the fate of this man's wretched  family, thus left without a head? They surely should not suffer "  "They shall not," returned the generous exquiste; "my purse shall save 'hem from want"  "In their name, I thank you, Mr. Crampton," said the planter, with a bow which was full of dignity and respect "I am not overburdened with money, but in my little treasury I shall find enough to ensure the widow and her little ones from distress."  '& "But Winter-" said the exquisite. "He will no doubt charge himself with the care of the woman he has wid- owed and the children lhe has orphaned," said Somers. "As for himself, I leave him to his destiny." So saying, -he took a long, quiet look at the dead man's body, and then made a movement as if to leave the spot. "A word, sir," said Crampton, who could scarcely restrain a cry of adnm- ration at the noble character of his companion.  The planter paused and threw on him a glance of inquiry and respect. "You and I, sir," said Crampton, " have, in some measure, been in each  other's way, in our mutual efforts to win Miss Wintah's hand." The planter made a low bow, while his cheeks became tinged with a slight  tell-tale blush. "It is my desire," continued the exquisite, modestly, " to have the good opinion of a gentleman for whom, believe me when I say it, I entertain the most, profounff wespect; and as a pwoof of my sincerity I here pledge my- "self to welinquish my pwetensions to Miss Wintah, whose affections I have ' weason to believe can never be mine, and to assist her by every means in my power to a union ; ith the man she loves. It is not necessary," added the exquisite, smilingly, " to mention him by name!"  "Mr. Crampton," said the planter, taking the extended hand of the other and pressing it warmly. "I appreciate your magnanimous offer, and'accept it; and I do it the more readily, as I believe you to be a noble and high- minded gentleman, as you have already proven yourself an honQtable rival. I will not conceal from you, sir, that your pretensions to Misso Winter backed as they were by her brother and faitter, gave me some uneastsS; not on ac-  count of the young lady's affections, for I knew them to bp'nine, but on ac- count of her happiness which might have been disturbed -by your persistence in a suit that never could have had, for any of the parties engaged in it, , pleasant termination." "I feel satisfied of the truth of your observation," returned Crampton - "and for that weason I decline a contest in which my heart has, after all, had but little intewest. When I wed, I desire a lady's affections as well as her hand, which I most assuredly would not have with Miss Wintah. And now sir," continued the exqui-ite, "let me say to you in all sincerity that I would rather be your fwend than your wival; and if you will honor me with your fwendahip, I give you my word as a man of honor, that you will never have cause to wepent it!" "I feel assured of that, Mr. Crampton, and cordially tender you my high- est regards. Should I require assistance in my suit with Miss Winter, I shall not fail to ask it at your hands." "Thank you, Mr. Somers, thank you 1" cried the exquisite, with a look of profound gratitude. "I desire no gweater happiness than the honor of being s            t r   OF MAlrON AND ItIS MERRYS MEN,         91 called your fwend! To have the ability to serve vou or Miss Wintab would  be to me the acme of felicity." "Accept my most fervid thanks in return," said the planter, prcessing his hand. "And now a word. Should you .see Miss Winter, oblige me by making no allusion to this unhappy affair," and he pointed to the body. "I 'would not have her gentle ,naturle shockedb by the knowledge ol the utter de- pravity of her brother!" "I understand you, sir, and will be silent as you wequest,." "Thank you. One word m:ore. I will, on reaching home, write a note to Miss Winter, informing her of the friend we both have had the honor of gaining in you, and of the confidence she may consequently repose in you from this hour. Would it be asking too much at your hands, my friend, to deliver that note to her?" "It would be a pleasure, Mr. Somcrs," returned the young man, with emotion. "I felt assured of that, Mr. Crampton," said the planter gratefully. "And now for a time, adieu!"  "I will walk with you as far as the woad," said the exquisite, " and there bid you farewell!" "No," returned the planter, taking his hand, " say it here!" Crampton looked at him in surprise. "Consider," said the planter, pbinting to the body, " this affair is not yet over, The bullet which made this poor wretch a corsq was intended for me; and the man who employed it is doubtless waiting at the edge of the wood for a report of its success. le may have companions, too, in which case I might have to work my way through; an easy task, since, as you see I have my sword with me. But you, my friend, you are unarmed, and there might be danger to you if seen in my company!" "I understand you," said Crampton. ' Independent of these considerations," continued the planter witl a pleas- ant smile, "you had better not let it appear to Richard Wiinter that you are cognizant of this attempt upon my life; it might endanger you; for murder-, ers are apt to look for seccu:ity by also asassssinating the witnesses of their crimes." "You are right," said Crampton, upcn whom this observation appeared to make a serious impression. "And therefore," resumed the planter, "you had better take the nearest route homeward, to ,void discovery on the part of tthis man or his myrmi- dons." ' But," said the generous exquisite, "if there is danger for you, it is my duty as a fwend, to see you through it safely. I cannot consent to see you go single-handed into peril " "I appreciate yoiar nobleness, my friend," said the planter, touched at this generosity, " and under other circumstances would not refuse your company. But, be assured, all things considered, you had better not be known in this matter, nor appear to have the slightest knowledge of the transaction or its  actors. As for nyself, rest easy: I carry a good blade, and nature has given me a quick eye, a stout arim, and a supple hand. Come, say farewell, at once! "Farewell-farewell!" cried Crampton, in a tone of deep distress. "For the present," said the planter, with a calm smile. "Yes, for the pwesent!" eturned the exquisite, ith emotion; "for God will not permit so bwave a man to fall!" And turning khimself away, he dashed through the wood, utterly rbgard- less, for the first time in his life, of what became of his ruffles in his'flight. The planter watched his retreating form with an eye slightly moistened     92        TIIE SWAMP STEED; OR TIE DAIS  by emotion The noble and generous sentiments of the exquisite had touched him to his i:. nermost soul.

And he turned upon his heel, and moved off to where his well trained  horse patiently awaited him.  CHAPTER    XIII. As the planter approached, his gallant steed saluted him by proudly tossing its head, pawing the air with its right fore foot, and uttering a low, joyful neigh. "My brave Arrow!" said the planter, tapping the intelligent animal fondly  on the neck, "are you then so glad to see your master back again? Tell me without neighing, for there may be foes around?" The animal bowed its head and showed its white teeth, in reply. "You are a faithful fellow!" returned the planter, caressing him with hit  hanld. e Arrow pawed his right fore foot, and looked at him with an expression  which said, "That's true as gospel, and I'm glad you know it." "I want to travel," continued the planter, "and wyith as little noise at possible." The animal nodded, and threw into his eye an expression which implied, "I understand that.7 What then?" "Once on the road," said the planter, "I want you to act according to circumstances. We may medt enemies, in which case it would perhaps be  well for you to remember that you have good stout irons on your heels!" Arrow winked one eye knowingly, and said as plainly as an eye could say, ' Leave me alone for that!" "Then, my brave Arrow, I have nothing more to say," added the planter, caressingly. "I'll mount now, if you please?" Arrow winked again, as much as td say, "Very good. Get on, sir!" And he bent down softly, not like any other horse, but very much like Arrow, who was so well trained and so fond of his master that he felt dis- posed to give him as little trouble as possible. The planter threw himself into the saddle; caught up the rein, and mut- tered in a low, confidential tone: "Now, Arrow-now!" The intelligent steed rose softly to his full height, and then commenced makingo a display of his Indian education, by moving over the ground and through the trees and underwood, with steps as light and noiseless as a doe's. "You are a gallant fellow!" murmured the planter, patting him encourag- ingly on the neck. "There isn't another horse in Carolina that knows how to conduct himself so well!" Arrow shook himself gently, as much as to say, "He knew that, as well as any one." I suppose you do," said the planter, conscious that he was perfectly un- derstood. "And mind you don't lose your reputation." Arrow pricked up and shook his ears, which his master comprehended to mean, "I'll look out for that!" They were soon on the borders of the Wood, and consequently within a few paces of the road. 'l   OF MARION AND I S SMERlLY MEN,         93 At this moment, Arrow dropped suldenly on his knees. The next instant Somers perceived a flash, then heard tie whistle of a bullet, as it passed di- rectly in a line over his head, and then the report of a pistol. The gallant animal had seen the black tube leveled, and was on his knees in the very nick of time!  As I expected," muttered the planter, drawing his sword, and rising in his saddle. : Winter is waiting for his report. I'll have to give it him my- self. Are you hurt, Arrow, my brave lad," he added, "that you remain so long upon the earth?" Arrow quivered and dropped one of his ears, a sign which his master at once understood as a warning; and the planter bent forward on his sad- dle till his face touched the mane of the gallant steed. As he stooped, a second bullet whistled over him, and a second report rang on the air I In another instant, Arrow was on his feet and dashing through the trees , towards the assassin. He had scarcely taken five steps forward when three men, and not one, as the planter, judging from the two pistol shots, supposed, darted from be- hind as many trees, and fled in the direction of the road. Somers recognized in the first the person of Richard Winter; the features of the others were unknown to him. Arrow darted after them, not like a horse, but like a mastiff on full run, and came up with the third whom he landed with a terrible kick, which drew from the miserable wretch a most agonizing shriek, as Winter, followed by his second companion, emerged into the road. Once out of the wood, Winter and his companion planted themselves in the middle of the highway, and, nothing intimidated by the fate of their con- federate, determined to take a bold stand. Winter, having thrown away his discharged pistols, appeared armed with a rapier, his companion with a rifle. The first wore a countenance black with rage and hatred; the second a face pale but determined. "A hundred guineas, in addition to the twent; I promised you," cried Winter, hoarsely, " if you drop him 1" "I'll win 'em 1" returned the man, quickly, as he raised his gun to his shoulder. At this moment Arrow, with his master, the latter standing in his stir- rups and with his sword drawn, sprang into the road. The eye of the intelligent animal detected the motion of the ruffian as he raised his finger to the trigger of his piece, and fell like a flash of light upon his knees. The planter instantly bowed his head down to the animal's mane, which his lips had scarcely touched, when the whistle of a bullet brushed past him, almost singeing his head. The next instant Somers rose, witl hhis steed, calmly, in his saddle, and dashing towards the rifleman, with one sweep of his sword, split the ruf- fian's head down to the shoulder.                 % The poor wretch fell lack, uttering a low moan xlllich Pesembled a last sigh, and was dead ere he touched the earth. Arrow now turned towards 'Winter with blazing eyes, mane erect, and launching forth a shrill, fierce neigh. Like the wolf, having once scented blood, he was anxious for a feast. Winter stood, sword in hand, ready to defend himself to the last extremi- ty. With every fierce passion aroused, his appearance was at once wild, devilish, resolute and sublime. Conscious that his black design upon the life of the planter was wholly understood, and that concealment was conse- quently impossible, he threw off all reserve, with the determination, now that he was in for it beyond redemption, to go on to the death. And his     "        TTE SWAMP STEED; Or, THE DAYS. attitude, while standing a little aside on the road, with his weapon on guard, and the expression of his features, whicth were pale but firm and breathing forth defiance, would have colnveyed to tlte eye of a speetator the figure of a second Lucifer, conscious of the evil of his nature, yet whose proud spirit nothing could eIppal, and whrose sole desire was the ruin of his enemy even though it might involve his olwn. The planter, however, now thIat he had punished the hired mis creants, con- sidered it beneath him to bandy words or cross weapons with their infa- mous employer. He was sensible also of the impolicy of shedding the blood of one who, w-hatever his crimes, was still the brother of his betrothed  and though satisfied that Winter deserved death at his hands, he yet felt that this was not the time nor the place to call him to account. Reining  in his steed, therefore. Somers wheeled the gallant animal around with the intention of movinl ofand leaviinng ti a miserable wretch to chew the cud of mortification over his baffled scheme at his leisure. Winte.'s quick eye discovered the movement, and his fertile brain-ena- bled him to comprehend its meaning.     '     ,  "He treats me with utter scorn,' he urmurred, half audibly, through his  set teeth. And as the thought flashed across him, his brow grew black. "Death---death!" he continued, "were,-preferable to contempt. He shall not escape me. I have gone too far, to fall back. Both of us cannot live and he or minust die! Meanwhile, the planter was slowly moving off, with his back turned, in'  calm, unmistakable disdain upon his enemy. "His life or mine!" muttered the latter, springing forward with uplifted sword to cut him from behind.  As he sprang forward, however, Arrow, whose Indian education adapted him for every emergency, and whose ears had been instinctively erect, watching every whistle of the atmosphere, caught the rustling sound of his movement; and darting ahead a few paces, thus evading whatever danger there might be behind, the intelligent animal suddenly described a semi-cir- cle, and launching lightnins at the treacherous tory, was about to plunge forward and trample him in the dust, when a slight quick motion of the rein restrained lis eager steps and brought him to a stand. Winter was now within three paces of the planter, who, with every muscle at rest, and his sword reposing across his left arm, looked down upon him from his saddle, with a countenance so calm and full of grandeur that the young tory was for an instant staggered. '"What want you, sir?" demanded Somers, tranquilly, as if addressing a  a stranger.  "Your life--your blood!" stammered Winter; "your life, your heart's best blood. Down from your horse, if you are not a coward, and contest with me the price of hatred!" "I lhave no hatred to dispose of," returned the planter, calmly; " if you possess any, I have no desire to purchase it. That I am no coward, you are as well aware as myself. As to getting down from my horse, I am so well pleased with my saddle, thatt'nothing but coercive measures would induce me to relinquish it. Are you answered?" "Craven-no!" cried the tory, fiercely. "Down from your horse, if you are a man; your blade against mine, for one or both of us must die!" And as he spoke, he raised his sword, manc bringing it down with a sweep, sought to plunge it into the planter's breast. The latter quietly touched the qanks of Arrow with his spiur, and as the intelligent animal sprang aside, the tory's descending weapon became buried in the earth. "You see-" remarked Somers, tranquilly, " that my destiny hangs not in your hands. Be wise, and give over your folly. As yet I have been able to keep down the bad bloed which you would startle from its repose; but I   OF MAXION AND HS MERRY PME.          95 may not always be so succesfuL Be warned, sir, for even now my 1finc'rs tingle to teach you the absurdity of playing the part of as sasi ." As he spoke, the tones of the planter's voice gnadually deepened; his brorv gathered slowly into a threatening frown; and his whole a-pocC was i m-. Pressively solemn. It was evident that despite his best efforts to prevent it, his nathre was slowly, but not less surely, working its way to Implire, a'1nd nmash alil, iti forces to unseat his judgment. "Ha I dare you threaten?" demanded the tory, upon whom these sirgns of anger's approaching outhurst were not lost, and who, so fierce w a is i thir li for a conflict which promised him an opportunity to gratify his deep-s-ated venom, perceived them with a fiendish smile, " prove your slf a Ian, and do it onl foot 1"  "Drive me not to it-drive me not to it," said the planter, solemnly. "1 would not shed your blood, nor imperil mine, now " "'Now'!" repeated Winter, with a sneer. "You are too generousl Neither now, nor hereafter, nor at any time have you the ability. It is not in your body; do you hear, sirrah," he continued, mockingly, " the nerve and ability to shed my blood are not in your body; they were not in your father's loins0. and are not in you, his issue. I'll test your boasted metal, if you dare for one minute to leap from your saddle; and I'll brand craven on your brow, as I did harlot on your sister's!" "My sister's!" responded the planter, in a hollow voice that canme up from the depths of his now thoroughly aroused soul. ' My sister's!" he repeated, and his countenance became livid and frightful "My'sister-you dishonored her, brought autumn and winter to her bruised heart cre yet she had entered upon life's sweet summer-and you boast of it I Base, bad man," he added. in a fearfully calm voice, as weapon in hand he descended from his horse and advanced upon his adversary, "as you say, we must cross blades!" tat For an instant only," cried inter, rushing on him furiously. "Take And he aimed a blow at the planter's breast. The latter parried it, observing through his pent teeth, as 'ie did so: "I have said, poor, groveiling worm  that I would not kill you, and I wig not; but I shall punish you!" h' You are too generous, by far!" returied Winter, tauntingly, as he turned aside the planter's rapier, and, by a movement, quick as lightning, sprang forward, and ran his weapon throulh his sword arm right above the elbow. Now that he was in the midst ofaction, the tory's senses appeared to re- turi to him with tenfold clearness and vigor. The foam quietly receded from his lips; his muscles ceased twitching, and seemed to brace themselves, like wires of steel, for the encounter; his furrowed brow cleared up; his pale cheeks assumed their accustomed hue; his lips dropped their rigidl pentness, and opened to emit a taunting expression, closed again, with a firmness which was vigorous yet calm; his eyes lost their passionate brilliancy and shone with a clear, steady light; the muscles of his wrist and fingers settled down tranquilly, and i e grasped thehandle of his Ion, slender rapier, with a strong elastic and unmoistened hand. He watched the deep and aroused passion of his adversary with a quiet, sneering smile, and being himself a most expeltt swordsman, fancied that, by a little skilful mnanceuvring, lie could lead him on step by step to the point of his weapon till at the proper moment, lie could with his sword, bury at one blow his long-nourished hatred in llis heart. Ashe drew back to make a second lunge, after successfully passing his blade through the planter's arm, he exclaimed, in a voice of insultinmg irony : "The first blood is mine t Mine also the pleasure of scoring 'craven' orn     96        TTE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS your rebel forehead, as I besmeared ' wanton' on your sister's! Do you hear, sirrah?" "My sister-yes-my sister!. she is not yet avenged!" cried the planter as he felt the blood triclling down his sleeve, while the pupils of his eyes ex- panded and gleamed with a fierce, unnatural light. And as he spoke, le drew back a single step, balanced his weapon firmly  and litlCly in his hand, then springing forward, lunged at his antagonist. As each had laid himself out for a death-dealing thrust, neither achievea  his object; on the contrary, both rapiers inet in fierce collision, forming a"re- versed letter V; for an instant they separated, but in another they were again together, and wrapped in an indescribable intricacy, from which it was almost impossible to part without breaking them. This was a trick of rapidr handling which satisfied each of the combatants that in the other he had found an opponent worthy of his highest skill. "You do not find it quite so easy a task as you proposed, to punish me!" said the tory, mockingly, for the purpose if possible of distracting his adver- sary's attention. And as he spoke, lie' pressed forward, to back his antagonist, and at the same time to give his own wrist greater play. But his effort was abortive; Somers maintained his ground, without giv  ing way an inch:. throwing at the same time what force he could muster into the muscles of his hand, and in his turn pressing forward to drive his oppo- nent from the strong position his admirable attitude enabled him to hold; and with success: for, in spite of all he could do, the tory was compelled to give ground, forced backward by the. superior muscular play of the planter. "Your nerves are in better condition than I thought them," observed Win- ter; "but for all that," he continued tauntingly, "I shall kill you-do you hear, insolent rebel? I shall kill you!" "My destiny," answered the planter calmly, "is in higher hands than yours. Your heart is bad, your thoughts are evil; you are sldlful only in the black work of an assassin. You should consort with thieves and felons, who are your equals, and not with honest men, who are your superiors!" "No matter what my heart, my thoughts, or slill," returned Winter, with a sardonic laugh, "I am man enough for you!" "We'll see that!" observed the planter, quietly. "Right-we'll see it, and shortly, too!" -,lded the tory, with an insolent laugh. "Look out, now, impudent rebel! I am about to part company with you, but only to resume it with four-fold alacrity!" "Ha!" returned Somers, calmly, "you say that?".  "I not 6nly say it," rejoined AWinter, " but I'll do it. Look to yourself!" "Nay," observed the planter, tranquilly, "that is for you to do. As for me, I shall look to you."         - "Look, then!" cried Winter, exultingly. And he made a quick, fierce efiort to release his weapon froml his adver- sary's, in which he was successfiul, and then fell back a fexwr steps to recover strength and impetus for a froesh and if possible a decisive onset. The planter at the same time retreated a pace or two for a similar pur- pbse. Ere one could count six the combatants'were again face to face and thrust- ing at each other with all the fierce calmiless of men who had met to do or die, who had the utmost respect for one another's skill, who were well aware that a single false move was certain death, and conscious that victory was to be obtained only by a thorough and accurate command of the temper, the muscle, and the eye. Every succeeding lunge was therefore made and parried on either side by the utmost circumspection. As yet, however, there had been but one sword tipped with blood-Win-  iiH   OF MAPION AND 1118 MERRY   MEN.        97 ter's; but one of the combatants wounded-Somers: and they had already been engaged upwards of a quarter of an hour. At length their rapiers again met and became interlaced to an indescriba- ble degree. And now the lunging and parrying had become of a fine and dexterous character. The fighting that had previously marked the combat was mere child play compared with that which followed. The two weapons were now so fiercely and intricately lashed that they appeared like a single blade of steel with two handles, of which each of the adversaries held one. Now this blade bentin the centre, now it was elevated, and formed the let- ter A; now it pressed upon the breast of the planter, now it wandered over to that of the tory; now it described a circle, then it was drawn out to its full length between the combatants; now its two sharp points appeared about to bury themselves, in their bosomi, and now they suddenly diverged up. ward, while the two hilts came together with a shock which threatened to shiver them in pieces. The eyes of the combatants, as the battle progressed, became brighter and clearer, and their pupils dilated till both orbs appeared to have become whol- ly pupilized, and lit up with transparent liquids, in which their very thoughts shone like imaged figures in a mirror. The parties pressed on each other with increasing fierceness, their hands guided to a certain extent by passion, but their heads calm and collected as if engaged in a work tasking only their intellects. Still they were individually conscious of the necessity of putting forth all their energies for victory, as nature was rapidly doing for them that which their mutual skill had thus far prevented them from doing for themselves; that is, bringing the affair to a close, by gradually depriving the combatants of their st'rength. "Your hand is yielding, rebel " exclaimed Wintert with a tormenting laugh for the purpose of distracting his adversary's attention. "My hand may be, but my heart is not!" returned the planter. "Look, now,j am about to return the thrust you gave me in my arm. Defend your- self!" "I will," answered the other, with a sneering laugh. "That boast is like the one with which you promised so generously to 'punish' me. You did not keep that, nor can you this!" "Nay, I shall keep them both," answered the planter, calmly. He had scarcely spoken, when making a feint to .press forward. on hil enemy, he as quickly disengaged his rapier, and fell back three paces, and this movement he executed so speedily, that he recovered, rushed %'ward, and plunged his weapon between the neck and shoulder bone of his Eitago- nist before the latter, half taken by surprise at the unexpectedness of the coup, had had time to guess his intention. Hastily withdrawing his sword, and retreating two steps, Somers ex- claimed- "I have returned your thrust; now for your punishment.' A stinging pain, for the planter's weapon had graced the bone, caused an involuntary groan on the part of Winter; and throwing himself forward to meet him, lie rejoined: "Tihat you will not, rebel: for I, too, have a promise to fulfil." They threw themselves at each other with a fierceness yhich threatened to bring the protracted combat to a speedy close. In mutually lunging and parrying, so close were they together, that their rapiers met at their handles, and their hands came in contact for the first time. In another instant they were wrapt in a struggle to disarm one another of their weapons. "They shall be mine," cried Winter, tauntingly; " and I shall at length bo enabled to keep my promise to kill you!" "It is not your destiny," returned the planter, quietly, while; he called ap     98        THE SWAMP STEED ; OR THE DAYS his strength to wrench the rapiers from the other's grasp. "You are a man of evil, and never keep your promise." And you-" said the other sneeringly. As for me," resumed the planter, in a calm, but. firm voice, "I have pro- mised to punish you, and God will furnish me with the means to make good my word, which is with me a matter of conscience." The tory laughed, satirically, in reply; and then bent all his energies to the task of wresting away the weapons and laying his antagonist defenceless. In the struggle, not only their hands, but their breasts, thighs and knees came in fierce collision. About evenly matched in strength, this close cn- test threatened to last as long as did the hot but skilful passage with their blades. At length, the tory, getting his adversary, by a turn in the struggle, with his back to the side of the road, which rose slantingly upward, tried to work him, by pressing his knees against those of the planter, backward till he should strike against the rising earth, when it was his design to fall upon him, and, in the suddenness of the movement, wrench away the weapons, and then stab him to the heart Somers, however, having during the struggle, taken a hasty survey of the field around him, at once comprehended the tory's plan, and quietly deter- mined to catch him in his own trap. He accordingly allowed himself to be pressed backward, till he was within, as he thought, about three feet of the rising slope, when, wheeling quickly around, he tnrew himself with all his weight upon his adversary, who, perceiving too late to save himself the object of the planter, lost his balance, and fell back, his wounded shoulder striking against the rough, stony soil, and causing him to utter at the same ime a mingled yell of disappointment and pain. Following up the advantage he had thus gained, the planter, with every sense alive, grasped the contested weapons firmly by their handles, and giv- ing them a quick and violent wrench, at the same time bending his body and throwing himself backward, in another instant stood erect with the rapiers grasped firmly in his right hand. "They are mine at last, you see," he observed, in the same calm voice which he had used from the commencement of the combat. "Now what binders me from keeping my promise to punish you?" "Do it!" returned the tory, rising, and folding his arms, sulkily. "Confess," said the planter, with an air of solemn grandeur natural to him on occasions of importance, " that your conduct towards my sister, who now sleeps in the grave your falsehood dug for her, was base, brutal and un- manly 1" "Never 1" returned Winter, with a coarse laugh, while his features, for all he could do, rose up in judgment against him in the shape of a confused gfush. "Confess it," repeated the planter, solemnly, " for the sake of humanity!" A brutal laugh was the only rejoinder to this appeal. "Confess," said the planter, in the same solemn tone, " that your conduct towards me since my sister's death, has been the offspring rather of a hasty head than of a wilfully wrong heart. Say it, in the name of humanity!" A sardonic smile alone was the only response. "Confess," continued the planter, " that this attempted assassination of one who had never, from his birth hour until now, wilfully injured you or any of yours, either by word or act, was the emanation of a hasty and un- generous thought, and not the offspring of a black, premeditated, long-pon-  dered plan. Say it, in the name of humanity "  "Never 1" was the brief reply. The brow of the planter grew dark, and a mournful shade settled over his features.                 ,           ,   OF MARiON AND HS MERRY MEN.          99 "You force me to it, then," he said, in a hollow voice; " you force me to it You will not let me, however much I help you by struggling with my- self against the desire, avoid the pain it gives me to lay hands upon you as a man takes hold of and punishes a brute whose crimes have cut him off from all ties with humanity! Be it on your own head, then, for 'tis you who force me to it!" As he spoke, he, to the amazement of Winter, who knew not what to make of it, threw the rapiers from him; then stretching. out his left arm, seized the tory by the neckcloth, which he gave a sudden twist, dexterously tripped him from off his feet, dealing him at the same time a stunning blow with his fist on his left temple, which, while it all but deprived him of con- sciousness, laid him sprawling upon the earth. "Now," said the planter, pressing his knees upon the breast of the pros- trate wretch, "ere 1 proceed to brand you-ere I do that which will make all men shun you-ere I put upon you a mark which will ostracisc you fromr society, and compel you to choose between herding with men of evil habits and isolating yourself from the world forever, I demand of you again an ac- knowledgement of your guilt as the seducer and murderer of my sister "  The tory unable to comprehend the character of the punishment alluded to, instinctively fearing death, now that he found himself so close upon its mar- gin, and reading in the calm but earnest eyes of his conqueror that his fate hung upon a thread, which a single moment's delay might snap and thus pre- cipitate him into the dark confines of eternity, he determined to release him- self from his precarious and considering his wound, exceedingly painful posi- tion, by a show of repentance, and, as'he considered it, a trifling lie. In ac- cordance with this resolve, he motioned the planter to relax in a'measure his  hold upon his neckcloth, and signing to him to remove his knees from off his chest, muttered slowly: "I acknowledge the crime. Arc you satisfied now?" "Not yet," said Somers. "Do you admit yourself an assassin, a liar, a hypocrite, and a villain? Answer! "If it will suit you-yes!" replied the tory. "Enough 1" said the planter, observing him silently for a few moments, and then releasing him with a shudder of disgust. "You are even baser than I thought you: for you admit your brutal treacheries without a blush I Rise -I give you back your life. You are unworthy of an honest man's notice!" "I may go now '?" asked the tory, with an assumed air of humility, as he crept slowly to his feet. "Yes," answered the planter, scornfully. "And beware how you again cross my path 1" "I can have my sword, I suppose?" added Winter, without lifting his. eyes from the ground. "Who hinders you from taking it?" returned the planter, with an expres- sion of deep loathing. "Think you I would pollute my fingers with its touch?' The Cory made no reply; with eyes downcast, to conceal a peculiar light which glittered in their pupils, he slowly approached the two rapiers, closely followed by Somers, and picking them up, examined for a moment their blood- stained points; then looking up and perceiving that the planter was regard- ing him attentively, he blushed slightly, and with a motion not devoid of a certain degree of grace, presented him his weapon, remarking- "There are situations, brought about perhaps by himself, when man pre- sents to the view of his fellow man the dark side only of his nature. Let us hope that the hour may come when I shall present to the eye of my conquer- or the better side of mine!" "No man, Mr. Winter, will pray more earnestly for the speedy coming of that hour than I," said Somers, turning away,to mount his horse. "Adieu 1" l     100       THE SWAMP STsEDi; OR THE 'DAYS As he turned his back upon the tory, the countenance of the latter assum- ed an expression of fiendish triumph. "That hour shall be now!" he murmured exultingly, "and the bright side be my revenge!" And, with a light step he sprang forward, and with a movement quick as light plunged his rapier through the planter's back. Fortunately for the lat- ter he detected the tory's shadow on the sunny ground as he advanced upon him, and sprang aside in time to prevent the blade from touching his spine, but not speedily enough to save his side from being grazed as the steel passed through his coat.  Incensed at the treacherous act, he wheeled upon his heel to face its cow- ardly author. "This is the second time!" he exclaimed. "'Twere a crime to longer show yu mercy " , "Let him who asks it, lose it 1" returned Winter, with a brazen laugh, as their weapons crossed. "As for me I have a strong desire to keep my word -a matter of conscience as you call it I It is my intention tQ9show you, in- solent rebel, the shortest road to the grave!'" "See that you keep it; I warn you it is necessary!" returned the planter, parrying a lunge made at his breast, and returning it with a success which tipped his rapier anew with blood. As for me, I will not kill you, but 1 shall leave a mark upon your forehead that will cause you to be shunned like a second Cain!" "Braggarts talk, men perform!" said Winter, tauntingly. "I have drawn blood on your left breast, I shall now draw it on the right,' returned the planter. "Is that merely boasting or performing?" "Boasting, of course," sneered Winter, as he touched his adversary slight. ly in the shoulder. "No, it is performing," observed the latter, "for ee and he lunged suc- cessfully, "I have kept my word![" And a red stain upon Winter's right breast, the twin companion of another on his left, as the planter drew back his rapier, attested the truth of his re. mark. "Bravo! That was well done " cried the tory, with a forced laugh, as his features became set and livid through passion at his adversary's success, and fear that he himself should, after all, be baffled in his thirst for revenge. "It was capital," he added, with a fierce, fiendish smile, "but not so good'as this!" And throwing all his strength, which he felt was fast failing him, into his wrist, and summoning every muscle into play, he made a few feint passes, for the purpose of entangling the weapon of his adversary, when, by a strong and hasty turning of his own blade, he succeeded in twisting that of the, planter out of his hand, and sending it whirlingly through the air for a dis- tance of nearly twenty yards. "Now," he cried, with an exultant smile, " now, rebel! I have you at my mercy. Now, I shall at once gratify my hatred and redeem my promise. Now, I shall show you my bright side, in triumph. Now, I shall plant my rapier in your heart, and my foot upon your body!" "Come on, then, and try it 1' responded the planter, throwing himself into an attitude of defence. "I have no sword, but I have hands; and armed, or unarmed, I shall yet brand you as a drover brands hts cattle!" "Curse you-this for your insolence!" cried Winter, rushing forward and aiming for his breast. Somers slipped aside, and throwing out his hand, caught the tory by the wrist. In an instant they were wrapped in a fierce struggle, each using his best efforts to throw the other off his balance, but with about equal success. Winter, however, conscious that his strength was not sufficient for a pro-   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         101 tracted struggle, determined to make the most use of the little he had left Bringing up his knee, therefore, with a sudden movement, he planted it with what force he could command, in the abdomen of his adversary, and followed this, a moment later, by tripping up his heels. In another instant, Somers, pale and speechless with agony, lay prostrate in the sun. "Did I not say it?" cried the tory, with an expression of fiendish triumph, as he stood, with uplifted weapon over him. "Confess, now, in your turn, that you are an insolent and ambitious rebel-confess it," he added, with a smile of mockery, 'for the sake of humanity 1'" The planter, despite his frightful agony, calmed his features and returned his enemy a look of bold defiance. "Ha! haughty rebel," resumed Winter, with a malignant smile, " you dare me to proceed? And yet my foot is, as I promised, on your breast. Con- fess that in this, at least; I have kept my word. Say it, 'for the cause of humanity!'" "Do your worst, assassin!" rejoined the planter, calmly. "I will 1" respponded Winter, with a countenance distorted by savage, un- relenting hatred. "It will be the fulfilment of my last promise-to kill you. Look 1-I am now about to pierce your rebel heart-to write 'craven' upon your brow, as I did ' harlot' on your sister's.-Listen, Neil Somers, to what I am about to tell you; it will make your last sigh as horrible as I would have it; it will make your very bones rattle in your coffin! Do you hear?" "I hear," observed Somers, calmly.  "Listen, then. With the blow I am now about to give you, I shall make your mother childless! Do you hear?" "I hear," said Somers, with an involuntary shudder, as he thought of his beloved parent. "Nay, more," continued the tory, with a frightful smile, " she shall be with you to-night. Do you hear? To-night, the walls that shelter her shall be fired,-to-night, the red flame shall consume and usher her timid soul into that eternity in which I am now about to plunge her son!" At this terrible intelligence, the planter's heart for the first time grew faint, and a cold shudder passed over his frame. "Do you hear?" demanded Winter, " 'tis I who tell you this-'tis I who shall lead the band-'tis I who shall give the order, first for her ravishnment, tlen for her destruction. Ha do you tremble-have I at last appalled your proud soul; have I at length, made your haughty heart quiver; have I given you a foretaste of the hell to which you are now going? Hal ha! this, this is indeed joy. This, this pays me for the undying hatred I have carried about me for many a long day 1 I would not exchange it for the Indies. Now, Somers! do you hear--now, for the crowning stroke. Now I am about to kill you, as I promised 1" And throwing back his arm, for the purpose of giving greater force to his blow, he was in the act of again bringing it forward, when he suddenly felt it grasped from behind as by a vice; a moment later, a crunching sound broke the stillness of the air; the rapier fell from his hand, and uttering .a shrill piercing scream, which awoke the echoes of the neighboring woods and hills, the tory tottered four or five paces from his prostrate adversary, and dropped, pale, ghastly, wild and quivering, upon the road. The planter was saved! $      102       THE sWAMVIP STtED; OR THE DAYS CHAPTER XIV. As that wild, alarming cry broke on the air, Somers, who had given up all for lost, and resigned himself to the fate which apparently awaited him, opened his eyes, which had been shudderingly closed to shut out the frightful picture of his parent's woes, as conjured up by his unscrupulous and exultant enemy, and looking up he perceived Winter staggering from his body, and a moment or two later, falling, from the effects of a frightful wound on his right arm, which now hung bleeding and powerless at his side. Relieved from the tory's weight upon his person, Somers at once compre- hended that he was saved by the timely interposition of some unknown friend, and sprang to his feet to return thanks to his deliverer. As he rose, he encountered a face familiar to him as his own; and this face belonged to a head which was bowing before him with all the grace and po- liteness of an exquisite, as much as to say-"Happy to see you sir,; how do you find yourself now?"Attached to this head were two large, black spark- ling eyes, which said as plainly as two such eyes could say-"I did that pretty well, and in the very nick of time, too, sir-didn't I?" The reader has already guessed it; the planter's timely preserver was his brave and faithful swamp steed-the matchless Arrow  As he recognized the person of his deliverer, Somers, glancing first at the gallant animal, whose smiling lips and teeth were red with blood, and then at the pale, quivering, prostrate Winter, comprehended the whole in an instant. The swamp steed, having watched with interest the progress of the com- bat, and seeing how matters were going towards the close, had quietly moved up behind the tory as that worthy stood upon the breast of his master, and as he threw back his elbow to give greater force to his blow, caught his arm be-. tween his lips, and buried his teeth in the bone. "My brave Arrow 1" exclaimed the planter, throwing himself caressingly upon the neck of the intelligent animal, "you, then, are my preserver. Ahl what do I not owe you?" Arrow turned his head and placing it fondly over the planter's shoulder, appeared to say, "Pray don't mention it, nmy good fellow. Such things are nothing among friends " "I shall never be able to repay you, my brave Arrow," said Somers, pat- ting him affectionately, " never! The gallant animal winked his left eye humorously, as much as to say, "None of your gammon, sir. I have not done anything more than my duty. You'd have done the same for me; and so we're quits." "You are the prince or good steeds," said the planter caressingly, conscious that he was understood. "We'll part only with life." Arrow licked his lips, arched his neck, pawed the air with his fore foot, and wagged his tail very conceitedly, and appeared to ask with all the coolness in the world, "Cream colored N'ell couldn't have carried herself better than this young gentleman, I presume!" "You are matchless, Arrow, aye, priceless," observed the planter, fondly. "But let us look at our enemy," he added, turning toward the prostrate tory, who, although suffering the most frightful agony, was yet conscious, and glar- ing up at the object of his hatred with an expression of fiendish malice. "Pray, how do you find yourself, sir?" asked Somers, advancing towards him, with an air of genuine solicitude. ' We are enemies, but I would not be so unchristian or ungentlemanly as not to offer you assistance in a situation so full of suffering as yours!" "Go P" returned Winter, whose physical agony gave to his voice a tone of extraordinary harshness. "I would not look upon you "   OF MARION AND HS MMtRRY MEN.        103 "But you are dying 1" observed the planter, generously. "Permit me,.at least, to lift you out of reach of the scorching sun, lay you in the shade, and run for help!" "Go!" repeated Winter, untouched even by this noble offer. "I would owe nothing to you! You have not branded me, as you promised!" he added exultantly. 'No," answered Somers, ingenuously. "God has, in His mercy, post- poned that unpleasant task. Should you die, your death will render it un- aecessary; should you live, your destiny will yet force it upon me I Adieu I I will send some one to lookafter you!" "Stay!" gasped Winter, with a look of intense hatred. "What would you?" said the planter, calmly. "Let this meeting between us, be remembered only by ourselves." "Wherefore?" demanded the planter. "I wish it," returned the tory, who spoke with great difficulty.. ' Some- thing tells me I am not dying; that I shall become unconscious, but that I shall yet live, and be enabled at a future day to resume this combat, which I regard as not ended, but simply interrupted, and postponed. Promise me this l" "Why should I promise it?" asked the planter, marveling at such endur- ing hatred, and amazed at such unflinching courage in the midst of so much physical anguish. "Because," returned the wounded tory, with an unfaltering eye, which glittered like that of a basilisk, " this is not my dying hour; because I do not wish it known; because I shall be silent to all in regard to it; because- draw nearer to me, my strength and consciousness are giving out-because, in my last hour, or yours, it matters not which, I have a secret to whisper in your ear: the secret key to my fixed and undying hate 1" The planter regarded him thoughtfully for a few moments. At length he said- ' I promise it, on one condition " "'Name it!" said Winter, eagerly. 'That you abandof, from this hour and forever, all attempts upon my mother and her house, confining your hatred exclusively to my person and my life " "I agree,' said the tory. "Can I depend upon you!" "I have given you my word in solemn hatred," returned Winter, with a cold, settled glance; " and you can rely upon it as firmly as upon your God!" "Adieu, then. Shall I send you help?" "No," answered the tory; "it is unnecessary. I hear the sound of ap- proaching footsteps, and shall be cared for. Take yourself off quickly, or you will be seen. Remember, I have your promise l" "I shall not forget," returned the planter, picking up his rapier and mount- ing his horse. "For the last time, Adieu!" Touching Arrow in the flanks, the planter rode off in the direction of Kingstree. Winter's glaring eyes followed him till he disappeared at a bend in, the road. "Go," he muttered, "and bear with you the maledictions of adisappoint- ed man. But carry not with you the fancy that your triumph is eternal I shall yet live, yet bend your brow to a l1vel with mine, yet make your proud heart shed tears-aye, tears of blood 1" He paused awhile. The agony of his wounded arm, on which the blazing sun poured its penetrating fixe, was intense. "Ohl" he murmured, striving to master the pain, "this is frightfuL It will drive me mad, and madness will cheat me- of my revenge I No," he added, with a heroic effort of his will, " riy coward body shall not triumph.     104        THE SWABP STEED; OR TSE DAYS I shal not yield to suffering. Death, rather than tha--death. I must have it-I will have it--revenge!-before I die. Ohi this cursed sun-it is broil- ing me"                .  Be paused again. His wounds, instead of declining, increased in virulence. To add to his misery, his blood was quietly oozing away from the three small incisions made by the planter's rapier. It was evident, taking these facts into consideration, that he could-not possibly hold out much longer. As this conviction flashed across him, he became terrified. "Oh!" he cried, mournfully, as if addressing the arbiter of his destiay, "save me for a time-for a time only. Let me not die till I have breathed into his ear the word my dying mother whispered into mine." The fierce streams of the burning sun upon his wound continued, and his anguish was indescribable. As if to increase it still deeper, the fact uprose before him that his physical torture was slowly but surely climbing to his brain, taking possession of one after another of his faculties, and wrapping them in darkness. "Oh, God!" he murmured, beseechingly, "let not that fall on me. Permit me to retain my senses, and do with my bodyas you will. I have a mission to perform, an oath to fulfil. Spare, O God! spare t me my reason!" Notwithstanding this appeal, his sufferings continued to increase till they became appalling. "Great God! great God!' he cried, with a piercing, piteous wail, " spare me, O spare me. It is soul as well as body you are consuming Ah! my God-my God!" This exclamation was caused by a fresh and more violent sensation than any that had yet afflicted him. It was as if a red hot iron had been laid sud- denly upon his tenderest part. The stiock was so, exquisite that he sprang to his feet and capered about upon the road like a figure charged with quick- silver.  At the same- instant, he uttered a wild, quick laugh. and a pale glittering light gleamed from his eyes which now coruscated in their distended sockets' like torches dancing in caves of gloom. "Hal hal ha!' he yelled, with a savage glare, and pointing to a some- thing which his fancy had raised before him, " they have put out the lights. All is darkness. Ha! ha! ha!" And throwing up his hand as if to ward off a stroke from an invisible ene- my, he staggered a few paces; then reeling, like one blinded by a rude, fierce blow, he sank back, outstretched, upon the road. His fears were at length realized. ' Light had vanished from his brain and darkness stolen in.  He was a maniac.  At this stage, an elderly gentleman, on his way to Kingstree, whose atten- tion was arrested by the young man's singular movements, advanced rapidly from the side of the road; dropping on one knee beside the body, he survey- ed it for a few moments with a mingled expression of astonishment and dis- tress; then clasping his hands, which trembled with emotion, he exclaimed, while a shade of agony passed over his features- "Richard, Richard I is it thus I find you!" It was the tory's father. CHAPTER XV. DAYs passed by into weeks, and Richard Winter's mental alienation con- tinued; weeks sped on into months, and his malady was apparently incura-   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         105 ble; months rolled away into years, and at. length his physician pronounced him wholly recovered, and he left his chamber.  "How long have I been thus?" 'was his first question. "Four years," was the reply of his'attendant.  Richard Winter could scarcely credit this intelligence. From the moment of his insensibility to that of his return to sanity was to him a dead blank. He remembered distinctly every detail of his combat with the planter, but nothing beyond it. And four years had glided by since then I He could not realize it. It was like a dream. Four years I What might not have hap- pened in that time I' At the earliest practical moment he hurried to Kingstree, and made his way to " the Palmetto," the resort of the wealthier young men of both par- ties. On the occasion of'his visit, however, there were but two or three per- sons present; but these were of the first families of the neighborhood. Winter's appearance, after so long an absence, created a sensation. The young men received him warmly, and one of them, the son of a wealthy planter, complimented him with the remark, "Now that you, are on hand, we shall have jolly times once more! For raising the devil, you were always the leading spirit!" Winter received this equivocal compliment with a quiet shrug, and after satisfying the curiosity of each of the parties present relative to his health, he seated himself at a table, and popularized his advent by ordering wine for the company. "Now, Clark," he said, when the noise and bustle attendant upon this movement had somewhat subsided, " tell lme the news." "The British are again at Charleston,' returned the young man thus ad- dressed. "Yes," said Richardt Winter, querulously, ' as prisoners? The rebels al- ways carry matters with a high hand!" "No," said the other, laughingly. "Tel'l boot is on the other leag." "What do you mean?" demanded Winter, while a peculiar light danced in his threatening eyes. "What I have said. The rebels' day is over. The king holds his own once more in Carolina." "Are you sure of that?" "Quite," returned the other. "If you doubt it, ask'Sprague, here. His father is a lawyer, and likely to know all about it." "It does appear to be so," said the individual thus referred to, in answer to Winter's inquiring look. Sprague was a young man of about twenty-five or eight, with a pale face, and calm, thoughtful eyes. He sat behind the table, in such a position as to command a full view of the bar room and all that it contained. His general appearance was manly and prepossessing. "When did this take place?" asked Richard Winter. "Oh, months ago," replied Clark. "The vagabonds of th:e revolutionary party have been very quiet ever since." Sprague raised his eyes and calmly surveyed the speaker as lie uttered these words; and a careful observer would have noticed a slight and almost imperceptible curl playing upon his admirably chiseled lip. "How was it," continued Winter, "that the rebels were deprived of Char- leston?" Oh, very simply," returned Clark, with a quiet smile. "They were starved out of it." "They were regularly besieged, then?" "Certainly. To do them justice, however, two thousand of theclm contested the matter bravely for six weeks with ten thousand of the royal troops under Sir Henry Clinton." "     1^ 106       THE SWAMNr STEED ; OI THE DAYS "Two thousand against ten thousand," said Richard Winter, with an air of astonishment. "And yet allow the siege to linger for six weeks!t With such odds in his favor, Sir Henry should have ended it in two hours. Bu!t six weeks! I never heard of such a thing! Did he show fight at all?" "Oh, yes," answered the other. "He did what he could in that way. But it didn't amount to much."  I should imagine not," said Winter, satirically. "And so, after all with such astonishing odds on his side, he trusted to starving the rebels into sub- mission, in preference to fighting them!" "Exactly," returned Clark. "He did not evince much anxiety for his laurels 1" remarked Winter, con- temptuously. Not a great deal," said Clark, laughingly. "As it was, the siege would have lasted there is no telling how long, had not two very important things turned up at the end of that time." "Indeed. What were they?" "In-the first place the rebels got out of food; in the next, -out of ammuni- tion." "And then they surrendered?" "Exactly. Men can't fight very long, when famniu is at tleir 'heels, and powder out of reach." "True. What were the terms of capitulation?" "Rather liberal, considering everything. He took possession of the city, and allowed the rebels to return to their private affairs on condition of their dropping their arms." "Sir Henry Clinton, then, is quartered at Charleston?" asked Winter. "No. He left some time since for the North. He has been succeeded by Lord Cornwallis." "What sort of a rman is he?" "One of' the right sort," returned Olark, laughingly; "just the fellow to teach the rebels a lesson. His motto is that short accounts make long friends." "He is, like his predecessor, lenient?" "Not at all," replied Clark, with a quiet smile. "The very reverse." The eyes of Richard Winter sparkled. "So soon," resumed Clark, "as he assumed the reins of power, he arrested the leading rebels, and such of them as he didn't hang or shoot, he threw into  prison, where they shortly after found a release from all of their inquietudes." "He starved them?" said Winter, inquiringly. "L-e i" returned Clark, with a shrug of affected astonishment. "Oh, no. The jailors forgot occasionally to supply the poor devils with food!" ' I comprehend," observed Winter, significantly. The eyes of Sprague flashed at this recital, and the muscles around his mouth twitched spasmodically. But it was not noticed by his companions and in a few moments these signs of irritation passed quietly away. "Are you familiar," asked Richard Winter, with an air of anxiety, " with the names of those whom he executed?" "Yes. They were published."  And he mentioned several, unknown to the other, winding up with-"That is all, I believe 1" Winter felt and looked disappointed. "Arc you sure you have. mentioned all of them?" he asked. '1Quitc," replied Clark. "At least that is all I can call to mind. But per- haps Sprague is aware of some that I have forgotten?" "No," returned Sprague, calmly shalting his head, in reply to their in- quirilg looks. '"You have mentioned them all." "There were others," said Richard Winter, coloring slightly, "sufficiently treasonabTL to haiL  been included in the list. Marion, for example.

"In the swamps, or the mountains--there is no telling which." "They are together then?" "Certainly. Marion is now a general, and Somers and the scalp hunter his leading officers. They are very harrassing and troublesome, and with their little band give Cornwa s so much mortification and annoyance that he swears like a trooper."

"But surely he could be followed?" th Certinly, that could be done, as it is sometimes. But then there's "What risk?" "The risk of not getting back again!"

"It appears to me that soldiers should never recognize such a worl as 'danger 1'" It appears they do, occasionally, notwittadi  ar  arl, when on the track of Marion and his men."      n; par  larly,     108       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "Will you oblige me with an explanation, Mr. Clark?" said Winter, some- what nettled. "Certainly," returned the other, in his usual quiet way. "When Marion retreats, he generally does so into swamps, where he knows every inch of ground; and once in them, he plants himself and men where the devil him- self couldn't find them; and thus concealed, they blaze away at their pur- suers, whom they riddle to pieces, while they are looking about to see where to fire. Of the fifty different parties sent out to take the ' Swamp Fox,' as Cornwallis has facetiously christened Marion, twenty returned without hav- ing obtained a sight of him, fifteen did not return at all, and theremainder, though outnumbering him seven to one, remembered the fate of their prede- cessors, and thought it best to decline following him into the swamps, from whence it was pretty evident he would not permit them to return." This intelligence was far from gratifying to Winter. He was still as bent as ever upon the destruction of the planter, and .the connexion of that per- sonage with such a man as Marion, whose thorough familiarity with wood swamp and mountain fighting, set at naught tht best efforts of the royalists disturbed him. But another thought now flashed across him. "How about the property of. these knaves?" said he, querulously. "Oh, that is confiscated, answered Clark. "Cornwallis made that one of his first moves." Richard Winter's features shone resplendent with savage joy at this reply. "Has the law in that respect been carried into effect?" he asked with great eagerness. "Oh, yes, long ago." "Then that insolent orator, that panderer to the rebellious spirit of the masses-" 1 Clark regarded him with surprise. "Whom do you mean?" he said, interrupting him. ' "Neil Somers 1" answered Winter, harshly. Oh!" returned Clark, quietly. "What of him?" "He, then, is beggared among the rest?" "No l" "No? You astonish me!" said Winter, turning pale. "Fortunately for himself," added Clark, astonished at his vehemence, "he had disposed of his plantation a long time before." Richard Winter's countenance became, at this reply, perfectly livid. "A trick-a trick!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "Nothing but a trick!" "Nay," returned Clark, surveying him with surprise, " the transfer is on record." "A mere trick to blind the law " exclaimed Richard Winter, perceiving the error he had committed in exposing his hatred to the planter, and stri- ving to redeem it by recovering himself. "Who was the purchaser?" "The widow, up the street." "Mrs. Brunton?" "The same 1" Richard Winter smote his brow with his clenched hand, as if he haa been shot.  Sprague, unnoticed, surveyed him with a look of calm contempt. "Are you sure of that?" demanded Winter. "It is so recorded," replied Clark, quietly. But," said Winter, vehemently, "I tell you it is a recorded lie I I know this man-am familiar with his cowardly tricks, and understand his move- ments. He foresaw the possibility of the king's triumph in this contest, per- ceived the danger which would'follow, and to avoid it, put his property out                 .   OF MARION AND IlIS MERY MEN,         109 of his hands. The move was a good one, but it was also a fraudulent one. I will at once unmask it!" Sprague's brow grew for a moment slightly tireateuing. "To whom?" asked Clark, quietly. "To Cornwallis!" "Cornwallis is at Charleston." "I will at once to Charleston." "When?" "This instant," returned Winter, springing from his seat. "Don't be in too great a hurry, and I'll save you the journey, said Clark touching him gently upon the arm. ' Sit down'  "What is it you have to tell me?" demanded Winter, resuming his scat. Listen," said the other, quietly. "The agents of Corn wallis made tho same charge relative to 'Somers' property, that you have just broached " Winter bit his lips till they bled. "Well, sir, what followed?" he said, hoarsely. They compelled' the purchaser, Mrs. Brunton, seeing that they could not find the planter himself, to swear that the sale was legitimate, that she had actually given the stated consideration for it." ALnd she made an affidavit of that?" said Winter, in a hollow voice. "She did!" The tory trembled with rage. A shade of disappointment passed like a black cloud over his features. "So be it!" he exclaimed, tossing offa bumper of wine. "Le's worse off than I thought him; for he has doubtless used the money in the felon cause in which he has engaged." "'Twas for that, according to the statement of the widow, he disposed of the plantation," said Clark, quietly. i"And how stands hi;s cause, or rather the rebels', now?" demanded Winter. "Black enough. Without money; without arms, without sympathy, with- out homes, they are hunted from pillar to post like outcasts-their hand against everybody, everybody's hand against them. Their case is bad enough." "They shall find it still 'worse!' exclaimed Winter, fiercely. "Traitora and outlaws, they shall meet with traitors' handling and ith outlaws' treat- ment. It is every honest man's duty to aid the government in a work like this, and I'll take care my share is done. I have been rusting for years 'against my will, and I long for exercise." "You will find plenty of that, if you join in the hunt against Marion and his men," remarked Sprague, calmly. :Perhbps you would like to join in it with me?" said Winter. "On the contrary," returned Sprague. "What am I to understand by that?" demanded Winter. That I am above mant hlunting!" returned Spraue, sarcastically. " I leave' such business to those who are made for it. I anm not on of them." "Perhaps you think it disgraceful to serve one's country?" returned Win- ter, eyeing him fiercely. "On the contrary," returned Sprague, "I consider it the noblest work a gentleman can take up!" "What am I to understand br that, sir?" said Winter sternly. "That what I propose to do is not serving one's country?" On the contrary," answ^crcc Sprague, who was evidently a man of very few words. "It is personal animosity which prompts you 1" You lie, sir!" retorted Winter, springing to his feet. "On the contrary!" returned Sprague, calmly, without stirring from his seat. "The lie is on your side!"     "O        TIE SWAMP STEETD; OR 'IE DAYS "D--n! ' cried Winter, "this insolence is not to be borne. Follow me, sir!" And placing one hand upon the pommel of his rapier, he pointed fiercely with his other to the door. "On the contrary!" replied the imperturbable Sprague; rising, and advanc- ing outside of the table. ' I will not bfllow you!" "You will meet me, then?" said Winter, his eyes glittering with passion. "On the contrary!' rejoined Sprague, with a low, mocking bow. "I have a sense of self-respect which will not permit it!" "Explain that, sir!" demanded Winter. "If you wish it, certainly. My self-respect compels me to meet only gen- tlemen " "'What then," demanded Richard Winter, trembling with rage, 'do you consider me!" "On the contrary 1" returned Sprague. with a derisive bow. "Curse you!" exclaimed Richard Winter, nnsheathing his rapier, ' I shall chastise you!" "On the contrary!" repeated Sprague, wi h a contemptuous movement of his lip. "Winter-Winter!" cried Clark, laying his hand upon the arm of the young tory, "you are carrying matters too far. Put up your sword, man!" "Never!" cried the young man, struggling to throw him off. "Stand aside. Do you think I am a craven to tamely submit to insolence likev that I "-But hear me -" "Stand aside, I say. No man shall give me the lie, and live!" "You gave it to him first-" "Give way, I say. He shall swallow that word or die!" "On the contrary!" calmly returned Sprague, in a tone of deliberate mockery. "Take off your hands, Clark-let me at him. Take off your hands, I say!" "Gentlemen, gentlemen!" cried Barker, the landlord, advancing with up- lifted and imploring hands from behind the bar, "have some regard for the character of my house. Do you wish to ruin me by your broils?" "Will you take off your hands, Clark?" cried Winter, menacingly. "Mr. Winter-Mr. Winter-" cried the landlord appealingly, and stepping between the combatants. ' Go, then, if you wish it," said Clark, releasing him with a shudder of dis- gust. "Out of the way, Barker!" cried Winter, rushing forward, roughly push- ing aside the landlord, and falling on Sprague with blind impetuosity. "Take that, wretch!" he cried, making a pass as he spoke, for the purpose of run- ning him through. "On the contrary," rejoined Sprague, quietly stepping aside to avoid the blow, and at the same time drawing his weapon. "I will take nothing of you but your sword!" "'Tis one thing to say, another to do!' cried Winter, foaming with pas- sion. "On the contrary," returned Sprague, witl imperturbable calmness, as they crossed weapons, "I do whatever I promise!"

THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS mission that might prove perilous to him. When it is remembered, that in the days of which we write, it was not consistent with safety for men to re- veal their political predilections to strangers,. the caution displayed by the new comer will be understood. "Are the rebels numerous in that section?" demanded Winter, speaking for the first time since the finale of hisfirqcas'with Sprague, who was quietly watching' the features, movements and by-play of the stranger. "That depends, sir," said the man, eyeing his interrogator closely, "on what you would call numerous." "Do they number scores, hundreds or thousands?" conltinued Winter. "If I were to answer scores," said the man, slowly, ' I might be wrong and I might be right. If I should say hundreds, I might be nearer right than wrong!" His auditors smiled. '"Perhaps," said ClMik, "if I should tell you we were kingsmen up here, you miight bo more at your ease!" "  Ah! sir," returned the man, scanning him closely, "you seem to doubt n:e.

The stranger's ferret-like eyes lingered upon his questioner till he had finished speaking, when slightly changingliis manner, he said- "Confidence, sir, begets confidence. I, too, am a'kingsman, although I would not like to confess it, as times go, in the presence of those who have thrown up their allegiance to the king. As for me, I am on my way to Charleston, with intelligence for Cornwallis. We have had a deal of trouble down in Georgetown, with Martion and his men, who have takei from us nearly all of our arms and ammunition, and left us nothing to defend our- selves with. We cannot hold out unless we have the means; and it is to obtain these I am now on my way to the capitol." "Have the rascals done mullh damage?" demanded Richard Winter. "Ah! a deal sir, a deal!" returned the man, shaking his head, sadly. ' They've burned out hundreds of families and converted them into beggars.

"And who will answer for you, sir?" retorted the man sneeringly. "That will I," said the landlord, advancing. "Upon my word!" cried Clark, laughingly, "this is amusing. Landlord, show the fellow to the door." "Go out, sir" said the host, who, whatever might be his own convictions in the case, yet saw the policy of humoring one of his best customers. !"Who'll put me out?" demanded the man, fiercely. "I will l" thundered Barker. "And I," continued Clark, advancing. "Stay "I said the man, lowering his pistol and pointing with his jerked thumb toward the door. "Here comes one who will hang ye higher than you tree upon the green, if ye dare lay hands upon a kingsman!" The parties paused in astonishment,; for at that moment, breaking upon the air, they heard distant strains of martial music. It is Tarleton," said the man with an air of exultation, "ton his march to surprise and capture Marion, and exterminate his band." "How know you that?" demanded Winter, eagerly. A dispatch reached Georgetown to that effect, as I left, stating that hl was on his way!" "Enough!" c4ied Winter, now thoroughly satisfied that his represents *x'EODClC    ILtlrlW  L'U    OF IIARION AND HrIS MERRY EMN.        1Ua tions were correct. "I'll go and meet him. Barker," he added, turning to the landlord, "a horse. Come, despatch!" "And one for me also!" shouted Clark, as the host moved off to give the order. On his return, the parties had left the inn, and were now out upon the wayside, straining their eyes in the direction of the music. The town was in a state of excitement. Hundreds were running on horseback and on foot, to the upper part of the main street, to obtain a view of the soldiery as they appeared in sight upon the road. The horses ordered were brought, and springing upon their backs, Winter and his companion dashed off at full speed. "Good!" muttered the innkeeper to himself, as lie beheld the head of the advancing column turning an angle, coming in full view and marching up ihe read leading to the town house. "This will make a demand on my larder and bar. I must go and prepare for them!" As he spoke, he turned upon his heels and hurried into the inn. As he disappeared, Sprague, after looking around and perceiving that he was not observed, turned to the self-styled messenger, and hurriedly ob- served- "You did it well, Cotton! But what news have you for me? How is Marion?" The man looked round cautiously, as he replied: "Well, sir, well. But let us not confer here."  "Follow me, then," said Sprague. And he hastily moved off and ti rned into the Georgetown road, slowly but carefully followed by the scout. They passed into a small wood on the wayside, and when they had ad- vanced sufficiently far into its depths to ensure them against discovery, Sprague began laughingly- "Cotton, my friend, you are a perfect Proteus. You not only deceived Winter, and the others, but you were very near blinding me. You acted it admirably! What news from Marion?" "All goes well, sir," said the scout. his whole manner, now that he was free from constraint, changing to an air of deep respect. "The general bade me tell you, so that you might communicate it to the other friends of the cause in Kingstree, that he is now encamped at Snow's Island, where he will be happy to receive such assistance in men, clothing, ammunition and pro- visions, together with such intelligence relative to the movements of the en- emy, as they may have it in their power to send him!" "All right. But who is this man marching up with his legion. Is it really Tarleton?" i "Yes, sir," replied the scout. "Hrow did you discover it?" "Very simply," replied the man. ' I was down on that road this molrfing myself; to see my sweetheart, and as her brother is in the tory ranks, to pick up what I could of the enemy's movements. She told me Tarleton was on his way to Georgetown, by order of Cornwallis, to track Marion who was supposed to be in that neighborhood. While we were conversing, the sound of music warned us the Englishman was approaching. In a few minuttes Tarleton appeared at the head of his legion, and taking leave of my sweet- heart, I crossed the road, slipped through a wood, and came out by a cross cut near the head of Kingstree, thus entering the town an hour and a half in advance of the Colonel." "Then the Georgetown story was all a guy?" . Every particle of it, sir. Hark! Tarletcn is nearing the town. I must 'be off." "Which way?"

"sBless my soul '" exclaimed Mr. Winter, "this is indeed news. Take a seat sir." " Th  ank you," said the corporal, " but not yours. If there were more than one here, sir, I should not object. But I cannot take yours, sir." ' "Poh I poh  my friend I" cried the delighted old gentlefaan, "don't let that trouble you.       There are plenty in the hall"" So saying, he hurried from the piazza. " " This is doubtless as good an opportunity as I shall have," muttered the scout, fumbling in his coat pocket and drawing out a letter. Holding it' up before him, he hastily advanced towards Amy, and threw it into her lap. " Quick, lady," he muttered, in a hurried whisper, " 'tis from Somers-- hide it." Amy regarded him for a moment with astonishment.       The name of her lover, however was a magic spell which restored her to self-possession. Hearing her father's returning footsteps, she quietly dropped her handkerchief upon the letter, and resumed her book, in the perusal of which she had been interrupted by the appearance of the corporal. Mr. Winter now returned to the piazza, followed by two servants, the one bearing a small table, the other a salver on which were a mysterious black bottle and two long necked glasses. " Bravo I"   muttered Cotton, on beholding these preparations, "   the old gen- ieman intends to do honor to Tarleton's messenger. Well, I have no objec- tions." The table was set, an additional chair brought the servants vanished, and the scout, in compliance with a motion of Mr. Winter's hand, seated himself to open an engagement with the mysterious bottle. Amy, perceiving how matter; were going, rose, and quietly  entering the house, left the gentlemen to themselves. Try some of my peach brandy, corporal-what is it?" " Doem I" suggested Cotton, modestly. "Ah, yes. Well, corporal Doem," said Mr. Winter, blandly, " oblige me by tasting some of my peach brandy. It is very fine, I assure you.

Nay, don't be afraid, corporal," he added, seeing that that worthy treated his glass rather modestly, "its' mild as oil, and plenty of it." , Thus adjured, Cotton filled his glass to the brim, and tossed it off like so, much water. Mr. Winter gazed at him in smiling astonishment. " Nothing like that in the army ?" he observed. "Nothing, sir " returned the scout, conscious that he was telling the na ked truth. For in his regiment there was not a particle of liquor. "I thought so !" said Mr. Winter with smiling satisfaction. " It was made under my own supervision. There is nothing like it within twenty miles." " I should say not, sir," ventured Cotton, "nor anywhere else, either I"  " Fill again, sir !" suggested Mr. Winter, pleased at the flattery. " Fill, sir Don't be afraid. There is plenty of it. My cellar's full of it !" "Is it? I'll remember that l" muttered the scout. "Tell me about Tarleton," said Mr. Winter, who, Cotton observed, had filled his own glass, but carefully refrained from touchingit "Ah," muttered the scout.   "I see his drift.

He might be able to  do something for him," "Sure to " volunteered the scout. "Colonel never takes a man by the hand, without doing him a friendly turn." Mr. Winter could scarcely restrain himself. Visions floated before him Knowing his son's abilities ajnd ambition, and his daughter's beauty-the old man paused-the picture was too tempting I "And he will be here to-morrow!" he murmured. 'Amy must be pre-  pared for this!" He paused again. The scout's ferret eye was fastened upon him, reading his thoughts with     1 the unerring precision of a keen and experienced mind.              i "This is the moment to strike!" he muttered. "If I might suggest, sir,"  he ventured, slowly, " it might be advantageous to your son, if you were to present the colonel with a good horse, if you have one.

"But one thing must be  counted on.' "What's that, corporal?"                            n "The colonel will make you take something in return. He is very proud in that respect. There was Sergeant Grantley's case, for example. Ever hear of it?"                                   b "Never, corporal." "The affair occurred about a month back, in the very heat of an engage- ment. The colonel was fighting hand to hand with a rebel captain, when hi  sword suddenly shivered to the hilt.

"Very, for the poor rebel captain," observed the scout, philosophically "What was the sequel?" inquired Mr: Winter, with an air of deep in- terest. "I'll tell you," answered the scout. n As the captain fell, Tarleton, turning to Grantey, said, Take this sword, sargeant, and use it till the battle is over When we reach the city, I'll give you another I' A fewdays afterward they were in Charleston, and the colonel purchased a t magnificant blade, the mounting alone of which cost upward of a hundred pounds, and attaching to it a sealed paper, sent it with his compliments to the sergeant. The latter opened the document, and read it with humid eyes. Guess what it con- tained." "Nay," said Mr. Winter, joyfully rubbing his lndsla, "my imaginative powers are so poor!" "It was a commission for a captaincy from the gratefil Tarleton to the man, who, at a timely hour, merely loaned him his sword." An expression of hope and joy passed over the bland [matures, of his au- ditor. "The old shark bitesl!" muttered the scout, observing him. "And this," said Mr. Winter, "is, you think, another timely hlour?" "I tell it to you as a friend," said the scout, in a maudlin, confidential tone. "He would feel grateful, you think, corporal-'what is it? Iny menory is so bad?  Corporatl--"  "Doem!" suggested the scout, with a mental chuckle. "Ah! yes. You thinkthen, Corporal Dem, the colonel woul' not forget the interests of myself and son, if I were to send him, at this juncture, when, as you say, he is so much in need of it, a finec dashing horse?" "I'm sure of it," said the scout, confidentially.

"Swift?" "As an eagle."  "Your fortune is made, sir!" cried the corporal, seizing his hand and daking it enthusiastically. "Your fortune is made, sir as well as that of your son. A more acceptable, and, permit me to add, sir, a more profita  present, so far as yourself and family are concerned, could not be made to Colonel Tarleton. He will go wild with rapture at such a gift, and feel him- self under such obligations for it as-to consider your interest his own, sir. Permit me, Mr. Winter, to congratulate you!" "Do you think so, corporal?" said the latter, his thin, sharp, calculating features radiant with happiness.  "Sure of it, Mr. Winter," said the corporal, enthusiastically. "But see, there is a shower coming up. Anrd-really, I had almost forgotten it-it must be near one o'clock." "Excuse me-excuse me!" cried Mr. Winter, "the fault is mine for detain- ing you. I'll go and hurry out Selim. I'll be with you in a minute, cAr- poral 1" As he spoke, he hurried from the piazza. "The hook is in his gills-the old tory is caught " muttered the scout, when alone. "He swallows bait and all! So much the better for me. I shall at last have a horse. I've wanted one long enough, as my poor legs, wearied with many a long journey, will gladly testify. Too poor to buy one myself the general has none to give me, and the enemy must perforce supply one; and why not this old rogue, who they say is rich and crafty, and un- scrupulous in his dealings with the rebels, as well as any one else?" As he reached this stage of his cogitations, a slight touch on his shoulder caused him to start. Turning he beheld Miss Winter, with a note in her hand. "Will you take this to Mr. Somers?" she said, in a clear but hurried whis- per, while a roguish smile played around her mouth. "By all means, miss," responded the scout, taking the proffered letter and  concealing it in his breast. Then, as he noticed the peculiar expression which played upon her features, he colored, muttering to himself at the same time -"She is aware of the trick I am coming upon the old gentleman. It's all up with me!" Amy looked at him with a meaning eye for a few moments, and then exclaimed with a low, silver laugh-  "You are a very naughty man, sir, in thus duping iy father. But I sup- pose the cause requires it, and therefore I must say nothing about it 1" "It's all right!" muttered the scout, his fear vanishing with her last words. "That's it, miss," he said aloud, with his usual impudence, "it's for the sake of the cause I'm doing it. I'm a poor devil, miss, in the service of my strug- gling country, and I want a horse badly!" "I presume so, sir," returned Amy, smiling at his deliberate effrontery; A" and as I feel somewhat interested in the success of the cause in which you are employed, I shall not betray you." "I am very much obliged to you, miss," said the scout, with a profound bow. "But be careful," added the young lady, archly raising her fore finger as she withdrew, "your dupe is my father; you must not bleed him too, freely 1"  "Fear not, miss," replied the scout, placing his hand upon his breast, and making another deep bow. "I shall touch him lightly-for your sake l" Mss Winter, upon receiving this reply, hurried from the piazza, shaking with restrained laughter at his impudence. "Sensible young lady, thatl" muttered the scout, as she disappeared. ' It   OF MARION AND HS MrnRRY MEN.         12 her lover were not interested in my return, which she knows well enough, she would make no bones of exposing me. It's all right, however. I am safe, and she is a devilish fine girl. Hark I I hear the tramp of Selim. His tory master little dreams of the lift he is giving, with his horse, to the cause. It would be a fine joke to let him know it when I'm in the saddle!" As fie concluded these mental observations, the scout threw his eyes in the direction of the sound, and beheld a negro, leading by the bridle, up a wide carriage path, a proud, stately norse, full sixteen hands high, whose brilliant proportions and dashing appearance challenged his highest admiration. "Ah " he murmured; with difficulty restraining a burst of enthusiasm, "who says the rebels cannot boast of respectable chargers to bear them into battle I It is really very good in the old gentleman to furnish us with such a princely addition to our horse flesh! He can't possibly conceive the im- mense obligations he is placing us under!" By this time the negro and the horse, together with Mr. Winter, had reached the gate and passed through it to the road. At a sign from the old man, the scout descended the piazza, crossed the gravelled pathway, and joined the group; and this with all the calmness, dig- nity and consequence befitting the character of a corporal. "There," said the host, with an expression of triumphant pride, and point- ing to the animal, " isn't he worthy of a monarch!" The scout silently examined the horse with the eye of a connoisseur, and then answered in a subdued voice--"I have but one word to say, in reply. Mr. Winter, your fortune is made!" "I knew he'd surprise you!" exclaimed the old gentleman, exultingly. "Stay!" he added, as he glanced at the animal. "The gift should be com- plete. I have a pair of silver-mounted pistols. They shall go with him!" "Mr. Winter," said the corporal, admonishingly) "the beginning of a heavy shower is upon us. I shall be drenched " "Dick!" cried the old gentleman, turning to the black, "run to my room, and bring down my new saddle, holsters and pistols. Fly, rascal, flyi" The negro had scarcely taken five steps when a flash of golden fire illumi- nad for an instant the black rolling masses of cloud above them; this was followed by a sharp, deafening thunder-clap, and the rain drops, which had previously been light and of comparatively little consequence, fell thick and fast. "Mr. Winter, Mr. Winter!" exclaimed the scout, "how shall I dare, thus soaked, to present myself to tht colonel?" "Stay, a moment," said the latter, anxiously. "Hold Selim by the bridle, and I'll run and get you my top coat. You can bring or send it back to- morrow, or next day 1" "Very true!" observed the corporal, taking the bridle, while Mr. Winter hurried to the house. "All's fair in love and war!" continued Cotton, to himself "I am in want of a coat, because it rains, and I have no desire to be wet to the skin, and this old tory can very easily spare me his and obtain another in its place. I am in want of a horse, and this old fellow can very well do without his. As for the saddle, holsters and pistols, they are his own offer; if I accept them, as I certainly shall, they will do rood service to the cause, and when the war is over, I may possibly return them to him, but certainly not before I Upon my word I the old rascal ought to throw some guineas in, to boot, for they are articles my pocket would eagerly welcome, the poor thing not having seen anything more respectable than a half crown for many a long'day. I wonder how he would regard the matter, if I should hint it to him? Certainly it wouldn't be a bad idea on my part, il case I got the money!

"Wrap yourself in this, corporal," said the old gentleman, tossing him the coat, "while I help Dick to buckle up the saddle." I'll do that without much urging 1" muttered the scout. "Brav6!" 1h continued, as he threw on the garment, "when the cold nights come again, I know of one rebel, at least, who'll sleep withoutcomplaining of the holes in his blanket!" -It took but a short time to get everything in readiness, and the scout sprang into the saddle. 'A word, corporal," said Mr. Winter, approaching him; "be particular in calling Colonel Tarleton's attention to the pistols in the holsters. They are silver mounted." "The instant I meet hin!" murmured the scout, as he winked confiden- tially in reply. When I meet him, I will most assuredly call his attention -to their contents!" 'You'll not forget to give him inv best compliments?" continued the old gentleman. "I'll forget nothing, Mr. Winter. When I see him, you shall not be for- ootten. Ah! sir," he added impressively, "you can't begin to estimate the fortune you have laid the foundation of to-day!" He waived his hand to the old gentleman, and touching the flank of Selim, was, in another moment, dashing off at a break-neck pace in the di- rect ion of Kingstree, muttering-  "And that is true enough! If the calculating old sinner is ever able to count upon the good fortune arising, from this investment, it'will be by an entirely new rule of arithmetic!" A bend in the road took him out of sight of Mr. Winter and the negro, when he checked the speed of his horse, and slowly turned off to the right. "Now, then, elim," he said, patting the neck of the animal encouraging- ly, "you mus'nt be vexed at this change of masters. The fact is, yoi are too noble a fellowto serve in the ranks of the Britishers, who hav'nt soul enough to appreciate your noble qualities; and that is the reason why, when I saw you the other day carrying the old tory sinner through, to Kingstree, that I resolved to take you under my protection. Like mine, you restive 'devil, you, your spirit rebels at tyranny, and therefore it is. but right I should enlist your services under the continental flag. So, young gentleman, now that I have explained matters, I want you to show your blood by taking me to the camp at Snow's Island in a little the tallest time ever seen in these parts. Are you ready, sir? You are, are you? Travel, then!" And Selim, as if comprehending that he had a reputation to win, called up hisprincelest energies, gave one spring forward, and in compliance with his rider's peculiarly expressive order, travelled. CHAPTER XVII. UP oN coming up with Colonel Tarleton, Richard Winter found but little difficulty in making his acquaintance. The English colonel was a man of the world, and very approachable. Skilful and chivalrous in the field, he commanded the admiration of his sol- diers; free and open in his manner, profuse, generous and punctual in his dealings, he won the esteem of tradesmen and civilians; frank, graceful and easy in his"bearing, manly and magnificent in figure, handsome in feature, musical in voice richly st red in rinld, piquant and seductive in conversa- ANr   tf.         012 tf')OF MA-!:.\X t AND 1S.: ev RV MPNR .   123 tion, he almost invariably succeeded iu wNililni the admiration and very fie- quently the honor of the geiltler sx.

Tarleton, however, wa too acc:;,itonled to demonstrations of this charac- ter to permit it to engross him. He received the flatteries and attentions of the tories, as they turned out to welcome him, with the smiling solf-posses- sion and easy deference peculiar to men of the world.  He drove up to the Palmetto, where, after a hurried whisper to one of his lieutenants relative to the disposition of his troops, he alighted, to receive in due form the leading officials and inhabitants; after which, accompanied by Richard Winter and some three or four officers, he retired to private apart- ments, from which, some hours afterward, he despatched invitations to the leading families of Kingstree and its environs to a ball he proposed giving on the evening of the following day. Richard Winter did not reach home till long after midnight. His father and sister had retired some hours before. He had, therefore, much to his mortification, no opportunity of laying before them either the invitation le bore, or his plans and wishes relative to the ball. Still pondering upon this subject, he threw himself-into bed, where, agita- ted by his thoughts, he tossed restlessly till daybreak, when he at length fell into a deep but unquiet sleep. It was noon when he awoke; his nerves were disordered, his temper harsh and petule!t, and his features pale and haggard.  He descended to the breakfast room, and found Amy and a domestic im- patiently awaiting him. He partook of the mneal in surly silence. When he had finished, he bade Amy follow him, and led the way to the drawing room, where he found his father, in all the dignity of full dress, impatiently await- ing the arrival of Colonel Tarleton. Mr. Winter was both pained and surprised at Richard's pale and nervous appearance, but made no observations upon the subject; for, if the truth must be told, the old gentleman both understood and feared the irritable dis- -position of his son, and felt no desire to incur the risk of drawing it from its oritical repose. "You are unusually attentive to your appearance this morning, sir!" said Richard, in surprise. "Not more than the occasion demands, I believe," returned Mr. Winter, blandly, "What occasion do you allude to?" asked Richard. "' Have you not heard of it?" replied the old gentleman, with an air of as- tonishment. "I should have supposed that you, above all others, would have known it-you who entered Kingstree in familiar converse with him. Has not Colonel Tarleton-" "Oh, you've heard of that, sir?" said Richard, interrupting him while an air of pride hovered round his haughty lips. "He gives a ball to night at the town hall. You and Amy are invited." "Ah!" murmured Mr. Winter to himself, " he gives a ball to-night, and invites me I That accounts for his not keeping his promise to call on me this m orning. I thought it was very odd." "Colonel Tarletoi," continued Richard, glancing at his sister, who was pale and frightened, "has done me the honor to take nme into his confi- dence, and at my request, giren me a roving commission to punish tho enemies of the king wherever I shall find them. I need not say, he added, drawing himself up sternly, " that he is thenceforth entitled to receive from me and mine the highest consideration and respect.". M r Winter rubbed his hands gleefully.    ; T            .S     124       THE SWAMP SrEED ; OR THE DAYS "Ah " he murmured, "the corporal was right  Colonel Tarleton is grateful; but in truth, I did'nt look for the proof of it so soon " '* The colonel," resumed Richard, again glancing at his sister, with an air which would not brook interruption, "is rich, noble, influential, and-" he paused an instant to give due effect to his meaning, and then added, with marked emphasis--" single I wish these facts," he continued with an air of deliberate sternness, as he fixed his cold, meaning eye upon Amy, " to be distinctly remembered by you, and be careful to rule your conduct accord- iugly, at the pall 1"Then turning to his father, who shrank from his fierce glance, he added: "And to you, sir, I shall look to remind her of what she  owes to her family. I have spoken, and see to it, both of you, that my plans for ennobling and enriching our family name, are not thwarted. Once be- ibre, I sought to strengthen it by an alliance with the Cramptons; wo to you," he added, approaching the door, and turning a fixed, pitiless glance ,pon his sister, who sat trembling upon a chair near the window, "if by any act of yours I am foiled now!" Amy remained, for some moments after his departure, like one stunned. Then murmuring, "This isthe essence of cruelty!" she fell from her chair in a swoon. Mr. Winter, in much distress, summoned two or three of the domestic& assisted them in bearing Amy to her room, and then bidding the women cab him in case anything alarming should happen, descended to the garden to walk off his excitement. This exhibition of his determination to rule the household was by no means new with Richard, and Mr. Winter had too long yielded to his son's imperi- ous spirit to dream of resisting it now. "It is very odd!" he muttered, as he paced up and down the gravelled walk, " this change in Richard's temper. Before his mother died, which is just five years ago, he was mild and generous as a lamb; but since that hour his whole nature has undergone a revolution: he is wild, fierce, tyrannic and  vindictive. I cannot understand it! It is plain there cannot be two rulers in the house while he is in it. He zill have his way, and it won't do to cross him. If he would only marry and settle down, I should be happy l" He continued pacing the walk, with his eyes upon the ground thoughtfully, and then resumed: "But, ;after all, he does everything for the best. Amy is head over heels in love with Somers, who, though he may be, and doubtless is a very fine   2 young man, is still of little or no consequence in the matter of wealth. At best he isn't worth over five thousand pounds, and what is that," he added contemptuously, " when matched with what my daughter can show for her marriage portion? Richard understands these matters, and consequently it was very wise in him to try to bring about a match with young Crampton, who, although he is, compared with Somers, a mere fool, is yet of very re- spectable connexions, who are both able and willing to set him up like an earl. Amy however does not appear inclined to take up with him, and Richard, cunning rogue! (I see his aim, now 1) is determined to drive her to a decision between Tarleton, who is a stranger to her, and whom she must pass through the mortification of courting, and Crampton, who is an old ac- quaintance and has long courted her! Cunning rogue-cunning roguel The idea is capital. I couldn't have devised a better one myself." At this moment, Richard Winter, dressed with unusual care, descended the steps leading from the house, and observing: "I shall not return till dark. See the carriage got ready, and have every- thing prepared by eight o'clock. The ball takes place at nine!"He passed out into the road, and calmly proceeded towards Kingstree. "He orders me as if I were his slave 1" muttered Mr. Winter, looking after him with an eye flashing with indignant light. -His anger was merely mo.   OP MBAlION AND HS MERRY MEN.         125 mentary, however. "But he means nothing by it," he added, as his passion subsided; "it is only his way!"As he spoke he turned on his heel, and slow- ly ascended to the piazza, muttering as he threw himself upon a chair, "It is very singular he didn't say anything about Selim. Perhaps the colonel, with his usual delicacy, advised him not to, preferring to thank me himself in per- son. How is youi mistress? Is she recovered?" This question was addressed to one of the female domestics, who at this moment stepped from the hall upon the piazza. "Yes, massa," answered the woman, with the. lisp peculiar to mulattoes "But she very mis'able, and wish to see you. She say she no wish to go to dis ball. Her heart be bery sad." "Ah!" murmured the old gentleman to himself, "I see. She desires to make an appeal to my feelings. I understand it; but it will not do. Richard would kill me. Tell your mistress," he said aloud, with an assumption of stern authority, "that it is my wish she should go." "Yes, massa," said the mulatto, and a tear of sympathy for her young mis- tress, mounted to the long lashes of her dark, expressive eyes. "Tell her," added Mr. Winter, blushing in despite of himself at his moral cowardice, " that I do not wish to see her till tea-time, that I do not wish her to speak one word upon the matter then, and that I shall expect her te be dressed and ready for the ball precisely at eight o'clock. Now begone, and see that neither you nor any else disturb me agzain in the midst of my meditations! Begone!" "Yes, massa!" The girl dropped him a curtesy, and, with trembling steps, hastened from the piazza. Ascending to the chamber of Amy, she tearfully delivered word for word the message of her master. "Tell me, Nelly," sail Amy, to her faithful and attached waiting-woman, "was there no-no appearance of sympathy in his voice, or in his eye, as he spoke?" "None," replied Nelly, indignantly; "and more shame for him to use you  so, my missee. He no man I Ugh I how I would like to tear him eyes out I He show no more heart than a tiger 1" "e Then God help mel" cried Amy, with a burst of deep distress, " for I am friendless. My last hope is gone 1" "Oh, say not so, misseel" said Nelly, consolingly. "Neber gib up. Who knows what may come up? Perhaps handsome massa Somers be at de ball Who knows?" And the faithful creature used every art to comfort her distressed mistress, but without avail. Amy's heart had received a bruise which time and kind- ness alone could heal: and she spent the day in tears. Colonel Tarleton was lavish in his orders, and equally as liberal with his money, and the large hall and ante-chambers of the town house wore fitted up in a style of great magnificence. The company began to arrive about nine o'clock, and at ten the ball room was crowded with the wealth and beauty of Kingstree and its neighborhood. The accommodations for the guests were on an extensive scale, the music was inspiring and of a better character than usually appeared in the town, and as everything displayed a considerate and liberal hand, there was everything to call forth enthusiastic encomiums, but nothing to pin a murmur on. Tarleton did his best to make everybody happy and at ease, and succeeded by appearing himself so. He was dressed in a suit of brilliant regimentals, which set of' his naturally commanding person to still greater advantage, and forced the admission from every, however unwilling, lip, that his was the finest figure, his the most clegant appearance, in the room. The only individual present who could at all compete with him in these respects, was our old acquaintance Frederick Crampton, whose mother in- deed whispered to her husband that so far as actual taste, graRe, beauty and     126        TITE SWAMP STEED; OR TTIE DAYS worth wen t Frederick was by far the most preferable man of the two. An opinion which Mr. Crampton the elder, being a man of considerable sound sense, and as such averse to libertines no matter what their standing, both si- lently and andibly endorsed! In dancing, there was no comparison between the exquisite and the roaue The former was all grace and beauty, the latter very far from either. Craap- ton moved over the floor without an effort, like one to whom it was an en- joyment; Tarleton's steps were visibly heavy, and taken with a certain degree of awkwardne-; ande exertion. By general consent the exquisite was per- initted in this particular to outshine his rival. Of the laldies, tie wealthy widow, Mrs. Brunton, was the most brilliant, il not the most lovely star of'the night. Tier appearance was at once queenly, elegant and volulpt;ous, and elicited as much admiration from the masculine portion of the giEsts, as it calckl up envy in the hearts of her own sex. She was literally st in purple, pearls and gold. She wore a tight fitting velvet bodice anll flowring skirt of a rich, glossy purple, the neck and sleeves edged with fine pointed Brussells lace; a necklace of large plumb-shaped pearls, set in goldc: ornamented her ivory neck; her small beautifully chisel- led Ihands were encased in gloves of a rich flesh-colored silk, edged at their lops, like her neck. wih pointed Brussells.; her wri ts were encircled by bracelets of diamond-shaped pearls tastily inlaid in beefs of gold; around her voluptuou, waist hulng .a Iteep zone of large, glittering, spindle-formed pearls, set in hollow cradlees of polishe: gold; from the lower edge of this gorgeous. belt, riunning ovr, and descending her superbly rounded hips, to the depth of some nine or twelve inches, and completely encircliqg her form, depended what might bo termed a waist tunic, composed exclusively of light, tissuey threads of the finest and glossiest silk, edged with a running series of large, glistening plumb-shaped pearls. Her small, fairy feet as she moved throughb the dance were just sufficiently visible to convince the spectators that she was as perfect in that particular as storied Cinderella herself. The palm of loveliness was by general consent divided between the charm- ing widow and the beautiful Miss Winter. The latter was attired with great- simplicity. She wore merely a white, close-fitting bodice and a freely flow- ing skirt. in her hair, which was parted in the middle, combed back and thrown over her neck and shoulders in a perfect shower of ringlets, she'hung for its only ornament, a small scarlet rose. Her fair bfow, straight. pensive features, modest yet graceful air, and faultless figure, stamped her the truest beauty of the two. To those who watched her closely, there was every now and then in her dreamy, wandering eyes and lingering around her small and beautifully bowed lips, a slight expression of' sffering, not at all in keeping with the festive scene of which she was a participant. Of the two, the widow achieved perhaps the greatest number of conquests, but Amy won the most sympathy. Mrs. Brluton was the most gorgeous, dashing and fascinating; but Miss Winter was the most loveable, amiable and interesting. The one wavs voluptuously beautiful, and captivated the senses; the other was simply, purely, faultlessly lovely, and while slightly appealing to the senses, quietly carried off the heart. The one reminded you of some gorgeous, voluptuous queen; the other, of a guileless angel. Tarleton paid great attention to both, and with his customary impudence quietly determined to adcl their names to the already long list of his victims. Well acquainted with the weaknesses of women, Tarleton generally knew when and where to strike, so as to bring them to his wishes. His previous suc- cesses as a libertine naturally led him to the supposition that his usual good fortune in this respect would attend him in his efforts to carry off the honor of our two, lady friends. His reasoning however was not bad, judging by- matters as they appeared upon the surfice.   ,  . .   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN. .         27 "This widow," he muttered, "is a wild, dashing, intriguing creature, full of passion, and will therefore give me but little trouble." Of the soundness of this logic, some idea may be formed from Mrs. Brun- ton's mental observation formed after her second minuet with the gallant colonel. "He is a vain, lively fellow, very fond of conquests, and flatters himself that. he could, by the simplest effort, lead me the same ruinous dance lie has already led hundreds of my silly witted sex. The foolish puppy! as if lie could make any impression upon a woman who had ever known that peerless paragon, Neil Somers"           " Of the widow's earnestness in these remarks there can be no doubt, since it was subsequently evidenced by the fact that she left orders with her servants early the following day that she was not " at home" to Colonel Tarleton nor to any one who should accompany him; an order, by the way, which was never rescinded!                 # "As to Miss Winter," continued the libertine colonel, "she is not to be awon so easily. 'She is too pensive, and I never had much success with pen- sive beauties. They think too much, and have too little passion. Once won however, they make the most charming mistresses-for a time; then they take to sulking, then to moaning, then to eternal weeping, prating stupidly in the meanwhile of their lost honor, the necessity of marriage, and all that sort of rubbish, till one could almost find it in his heart to silence their groaning forever by a dose of poison. Still Miss Winter would make a be- witching mistress for a month or two, and I shall of course take her in hand. The sooner I make her' the temporary bride of my heart-not my hland by any means, for liberty to roam from flower to flower is too sweet-the better fog I shall not linger long in this quarter of the country, and I shall pick up enough others elsewhere." Amy's simple heart entertained very opposite views of the brilliant roue. "Ah " she murmured, as Tarleton, after a brief conversation, left her, to pay his Court, for a few moments, to the fascinating widow, "what a contrast between this insipid libertine and the noble-minded Somers. Is it possible that a gross, superficial wretch like him can win the heart of a pure-minded woman? And yet it is to such a worthless, hollow-hearted being, Richard would see me linked. O, rather than that, the grave!" The libertine's chances, then, with regard to the dashing widow and the modest, retiring, pure-hearted maiden, were somewhat slim. Tarleton, however, was every where; and many a quiet glance of the eye, and many a soft, palmy pressure of the hand admonished him of conquests he had made, and of meetings yet in store. He was in consequence in the highest of spirits, and highly popular throughout the evening. Richard Winter succeeded, about eleven o'clock, in obtaining Mrs. Brunton for his partner in a minuet, and did his best to make an impression upon her hard heart, but failed, as usual. She treated him politely, but with consider-  able coldness. The widow had heard, through young Clark, who was one of her visitors, of the tory's vindictive display against Somers, at the Palmet- to, and could scarcely restrain her indignation. She made no allusion to it. however, and Richard Winter was puzzled to account for her hauteur. Un- able to form a satisfactory solution of the matter, he imputed it to a some- thing arising from the exquisite, Crampton, who, he remembered, had been the lady's partner in the previous set, as well as in two or three others pre- ceeding, that. He then reflected that the exquisite had, as he had heard, been a somewhat constant visitor at Mrs. Brunton's for the four years that he, by his aberration of intellect, had been confined to his roonm. As these thoughts crossed him, the brow of the tory darkened. "Crampton shall atone for this," he muttered. " s it not enough that he \     1]28      * THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS  visits my sister, but must he, slighting her, and thereby angering me, also cross me in my crusade against this woman and her purse." In an instant he thought of Tarleton, and his features assumed a severe expression. ' Io, ho!" he muttered, "has he been tampering with this woman I Curse him! I design Amy for his wife, and he must not attempt an intrigue with another right under my very ey6s, while paying his court to her." His brow darkened still another shade, as he reflected, for the first time, seriously, upon the libertine character of the colonel. Cal it be," he murmured, as an uneasy thought crossed him, " that his design is also upon the honor and not on the affections of Amy? If so, let him beware! There is a devil slumbering in my breast-and devils some- times kill." As he made this mental observation, he turned his eyes towards his siters, who was standing with the colonel, in another set, and awaiting her turn in the dance. Tarleton was at that moment making an observation to his fair partner, the effect of which was to compel her to drop her eyes and to call up a blush quick and deep as crimson. It was, in fact, an elopement which the gallant colonel, who, with his usual vanity, presumed that he had achieved a conquest, had the impudence to pro- pose to her. "What in fury does that mean?" muttered Richard, observing them. "Has lie dared to insult her with a dishonorable proposal?" Mrs. Brunton had quietly followed the direction ofher partner's eyes, and witnessed the little incident which had ruffled him: A moment later, and she whispered to him: "Mr. Winter, something disturbs Amy. She blushes, and her eyelids are moist with tears. She will fall, if she is not attended to." Richard started at these words as if he had been stung by a basilisk. They were spoken in that quiet, satirical tone which implies that more is concealed than uttered. Did Mrs. Brunton then suspect him and his motives in for- cing Amy as it were into Tarleton's notice? If so, she must despise him. In which case his hopes of her hand and wealth were at an end He shud- dered at the thought. "'Tis nothing," he said, in reply to her interrogating glance. "It is one of her fits. She has them frequently." ' Oh, indeed!" said the widow, with an icy sarcasm. "I was not aware of that  Poor girll many such 'fits' would kill me. She must have a con- stitution like iron!" Amy's position was very distressing. She could make no reply to the lib ertine's insulting proposal except to preserve an indignant silence. Her feel- ings were wounded to a degree, and yet she had no one to whom she could confide her sorrows or look for sympathy. Her father and brother com- pelled her to endure her unhappy position unmurinuringly, She felt that she was without afriend in the world, an-d hardly knew, so much was she terri- fied and confused by the libertine insolence of her partner, and the conscious- ness of her utter loneliness, and the despotism of her cruel and ambitious brother. what to think or do. 'It was- as Mrs. Brunton e.:cressed it-she was near falling.  The quiet sarcasm of his tormenting companion in the dance, was not without its effect upon Richard Winter. The blood deserted his face, and a yellow tinge of shame settled for a few moments upon either cheek. a. "You are severe, madam!" he said, making an effort to excuse himself. "You forget that Amy is unacclstomed' to scenes like this, and more es- pecially to company like Colonel Tarleton's. The sphere in which te is accustomed to move, is so far above that in which she mingles, that his supe- rior convensational powers astonish. and, perhaps, humillateeher. She should   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.        129 go more into society, and accustom herself to these things. At present, she is imply a green country girl, and the manners of polished circles astonish her. She will get familiar with them, by and bye!" "You hope so, no doubt 1" returned Mrs. Brunton, with an air which no- tified her companion that she wished the subject dropped. Midnight drew near, the intermission came, and the guests moved from the ball room to partake of refreshment. Frederick Crampton had attended Mrs. Brunton to the fete, and he now approached to conduct her to the supper room. "Really, Mr. Crampton," she said, with an air it was impossible to resist, "I should prefer to have you escort me home 1" "If you weally desire it, certainly!" replied the exquisite, without evincing any surprise. "May I ask," he continued, while leading her to the dressing room, " the weason why you have wesolved to depwive the company so early of the two wosiest cheeks in the woom!" "It is," replied the widow, smiling at the flattery, "because I wish to pre- serve those roses for to-morrow!" "You are a chawming cweature!' observed the exquisite, with a graceful bow, as Mrs. Brunton glided from his arm into the dressing room. "1.could almost love her!" he murmured, moving off to prepare himself for de- parture. Richard Winter, with Amy upon his arm, had already retired to the sup- per room, whither the remaining guests were now slowly and quietly mov- ing. Mr. Winter had, early in the evening, been presented to Colonel Tarleton; but it was at a moment when that personage was surrounded by a number of his officers, and other friends, whose presence precluded the possibility of an exchange of even a few words. From that period to that of the intermis- sion, Mr. Winter had been making the most strenuous efforts to catch the colonel's eye, but without effect. The latter was so deeply occupied in at- tentions to the fairer portion of the company, and in responding to formal introductions to the other, that the old gentleman had been unable to obtain even a passing recognition. Determined, however, upon gaining his point, that is to say, an acknowl- edgment of the reception of the matchless Selim, Mr. Winter, as the intermnis- sion drew near, planted himself at the door leading to the supper room, for the purpose of catching Colonel Tarleton by the button as he passed from the hall The old gentleman's patience was not tasked long. Ere he had taken up his position at the door five minutes, Colonel Tarleton approached, followed  by a number of friends. As he neared the supper room, Colonel Tarleton observed a spruce, old gentleman, standing in the doorway, and eyeing him with a peculiar expres- sion. "You wish to speak to me, sir?" he said, with a gracious air. "Yes, sir-Colonel Tarleton, I mean-" returned Mr. Winter, confusedly delighted at the success thus far of his little scheme, and bowing almost to the floor. "A momentary favor, colonel, if you please." "Well, sir?" said Tarleton, inquiringly. "I wish to know, my dear colonel," said the old gentleman, blushing with rapture at the honor of conversing with so illustrious a personage as the man before him, "how you like Selim?" "Selim, sir?' returned Tarleton, ia surprise. "What do you mean, sir?" Mr. Winter looked at him for a moment, and then replied with a smile. "Oh, I see. The corporal forgot to ell you his name! That was very wrong of him!" 17     130       TIE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS  "The corporal, sir? What corporal?" demanded Tarleton, in astonish- ment. "Corporal Doem," replied the old gentleman, expecting the mention of that name would recall to Colonel Tarleton a sense of his meaning. "Corporal Doem!" repeated Tarleton, indignantly, "What do youmean? Doyouwishtoinsultme? Explain yourself! Who are you, sir?"  An& without giving him time to reply, the colonel turned to his companions, and added: Do you know tis old gentleman, irs! Whoishe?

Please to stand aside, sir," he added, somewhat sternly, " the guest are desirous of passing and you are in their way l" Mr. Winter's hair uprose in terror. A horrible suspicion took possession of his mind. "You do not mean to say, Colonel Tarleton," he exclaimed, moving from the doorway, "that you have not received my princely horse-my Selim?" do mean to say so, sir, returned the colonel, surveying him with a cold, supercilious stare.

"No more than the saddle 1" "Nor my silver mounted pistols?" "No more than the holsters      in    e  The countenance of Mr. Winter was now an index of the most ludicrous despair. "And you don't know the corporal-Corporal Doem?" he added, trem- bling with terror. I only know," replied Tarleton, surveying him contemptuously, "that you are either drunk or crazy and that your best friend would be a straight jacket!" Wih these words, the colonel, followed by his companions, passed laugh- inly through the door of the supper room leaving the old gentleman per- fectly stupified. In a few minutes e was sufficiently recovered to hasten from the bll room, jump into his carriage, and order his coachmen to drive home. He ascended to his chamber with trembling. steps, and threw himselfwildly upon his bed, cursing his folly and breathing vengeance most dire upon Corporal Doem. Meanwhile all was mirth and excitement at the town house. Tarleton and his companions jested and laughed over the corporal's exploit and his victims discomfiture. The joke spread from table to table with great rapidi- ty; from the supper room it extended to the ball room, from the ball room to the dressing rooms, from thence to the loungers about the door, from them to the stradglers in the street, and from these to the Palmetto. Richar  inter's surprise and ortification, upon hearing it, were indes- rom up\.t  ...:..;ln-seadtrwhmefidyuo    OF MARION AND HS i  W R INXY MEN.     131 cribable. ie could scarcely restrain himself from instantly rising and hur rying from the scene. Bending over the table at which they were sitting, he demanded of his sister if the story was correct. "I know nothing to the contrary," replied Amy, with a deep blush. "A man, in the dress of an officer, called yesterday upon 'pa; stated that helhad been sent with a commission from Colonel Tarleton, though what it was I do not know, for I retired to my room on his arrival; oi his departure, however, he certainly did go away on Selim's back, and wrapped, for it was raining, in papa's top coat. I saw him from my window." "Did father say anything to you about it, after the fellow had gone?" asked Richard. "Not a word," replied Amy. Richard bit his lips and bent over his plate to conceal his annoyance. His first impulse was to return immediately to the ball room, seek his father, and de- mand an explanation; but as such a course would have the effect of'drawing all eyes upon him, he determined to remain where he was, till the dmuipa- ny arose and made a general movement to retire from the room, when he would mingle with the throng, and thus avoid exposing himself to observa- tion and remark. About one o'clock, the musicians returned to the orchestra, and a moment later struck up a march to warn the company that the dance was about to be resumed. As the guests moved slowly from the supper room, Richard Winter, with his sister upon his arm, mingled among them, and on entering the hall, pro- ceeded with Amy at once to the ladies' dressing room, at the door of which he left her, bidding her prepare for an immediate departure. Not a word was exchanged between them on their journey home; on reaching which, Richard foaming with mortification and rage, darted up the staircase, threw open the door of a small chamber, and the next instant, pale and trembling with passion, he stood face to face with his father. The latter, with his usual weakness, gave way before the impettous man- ner of his son. "Do you know, sir," said Richard, fiercely, " that your folly has made us the laughing stock of Kingstree?" "I cannot help it, Richard," answered Mr. Winter, whiningly. "I cannot help it. I did it all for the best." "For the best? O yes, doubtless P' said Richard, with an air of mockery. "Come, sir, sit down, and explain this affair. I wish to understand it in all its details. His father complied, relating with great succinctness the whole of his in- terview and its results with the self-styled Corporal Doem, and concluded by repeating word for word his colloquy with Colonel Tarleton. "So, sir," said Richard, as he finished, "with all your boasted sagacity. and experience, you were not sharp enough to detect the transparent trick of this rebel rogue. And you did it all for the best, too; poor, snivelling old dotard  In future, look to your own affairs, and let my advancement alone. I'll look to that, and see 'that I get it, without help from a miserable old driveller like you!" "Richard-Richard!" cried his father, lifting up his clasped hands, with an. imploring air, " don't talk to me in that way-don't, you'll break my heart." "Your heart?" returned Richard, with an expression of mockery. ' Have you such a thing? If so, let it feel for me." "For you, Richard, my son?" "For me!" repeated the young man, impetuously; "for me, Whom you have shamed by your this night's folly; for me, whose plans you have thwarted and covered with ridicule. You were aware of my design upon Tarleton. You knew I took Amy to the ball that her surpassing beauty     132       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS might infatuate and subsequently beguile him into a marriage.

Aye, bow your head, hoary headed driveller," he added as his father bent forward on his chair, and resting his elbows on his knees. covered his eyes with his hands, " and groan over your folly!" The old man could endure these insulting reproaches no longer. Dropping his hands from before his eyes, which were moist with tears, he rose to his feet, and advancing towards the young man, said, sternly- No more of this language, sir. I've endured it too long. I am your father, but I am not your dog; and you shall not treat me as such!" Shall not?" returned Richard, sneeringly. "SHAI, not!" thundered Mr Winter, with a firmness that made the young man tremble. :"Your despotic reign is over. You have ruled me and my house with an iron hand; forgetting, in your unbridled insolence, that Inwas its owner, and your father. I yielded to it, because, for all your faults, I loved you, and because you were my son!" The sneer, which had disappeared from Richard's eye and lip at the be- ginning of this speech, now returned, with increased force and expression. "Ah!" he said, satirically, " ' because I was your son?' You yielded to me for that; for that, 'with all my faults, you loved me?"' The old man surveyed him, for a few moments, with astonishment, then with horror, and lastly with despair. "Devil!" he said, trembling with rage. " what mean you by that sneer? Are you so'utterly lost to shame, as to impugn the honor of your dead mo- ther? Wretch-devil-answer me! Nay," he added, hastily, throwing up his hand and fleeing from him, as Richard was about to speak, " nay, answer nod  I would not hear your ingrate heart pour forth its black venom in my aged ear! Go-fly-get from me. Leave my presence. You are a demon in the disguise of him who was once my son. Go-I would not look upon, I would not hear you! You have dared to cast a doubt upon the virtue of my departed wife, upon her who bore you. Your demon eye appals me- go, ingrate, go!" The young man eyed him calmly; the dark, implying sneer still glistening in his orbs still darkening his lip, It was as his father expressed it. His appearance was that of a cool, cal- culating, remorseless demon. "You will not hear me?" he said tranquilly, without removing his gaze for an instant from off his father. "You will not hear me? That is one of your follies. You will,not only hear me, but you shall feel me! You say my reign is over. I answer, it is but just begun. You charge me with ru- ling you and the house with a hand of iron. That is another of your drivel- ling absurdities. I have dealt with you mildly, compared with what I shall deal with you henceforth, unless you are more tractable. Instead of ruling you with an iron hand, I shall sway you with one of steel. If I am insolean, 'tis you-who, by encouraging the waywardness of my youth, have made me so, and 'tis you who shall answer it.

And s6, good night!" With these words, he moved slowly, haughtily, and defiantly to the door, keeping his eyes fixed on those of his father, whom they appeared to fasci- nate, by some mysterious power, to the last. "I am conquered!" murmured the old man, as Richard disappeared. While his mother lived, I was wife-ridden; she is dead, and I am son-rid-   OF MARION AND HS MERRy MEN.         133 den.  h, heaven!" he exclaimed, placing both hands upon his temples, which were' throbbing fiercely, "my brain will burst " Hie rose, fastened the door, and paced the chamber, uneasily. His steps were quick and nervous. "And this," he muttered tears starting from Iis eyes and coursing down his cheeks, " thisis the result of all my hopes; my anxieties and cares-this, O God! this  Who would be a father!" His feelings overpowered him; he staggered to a chair, dropped upon it, buried his head in his hands, and sobbed. The tears that bedewed his cheeks were hot and scalding. For this," he groaned, "I have toiled, worried and fumed; for this I pet- ted, spoiled, and made him, from his earliest days till now, the favorite child; for this, that she might treat him kindly, she who never seemed to love him I bore the ruling spirit of his mother without a murmur; for this, I have taken advantage of men's necessities, and steeled my heart against the cries of woe, of pity, of humanity, that my coffers might never be empty to him; for this, that none other should divide my affections or the rule of the house with him, I have, since his mother's death, remained without a companion; for this, I have stood up for him, in defiance of the light of my better reason, against complaining friends and neighbors, when they found him meddlesome insolent and vindictive; for this, mine eyes have ached with watchilg, mine ears wearied with hearkening, through the long, lone nights, when riot and debauchery detained him abroad; for this, I have cut off my daughlter-my gentle, suffering, unassuming Amy-from all interest in my heart, that none but this bad, undeserving boy might engross my affections-for this, I have made my daughter nothing, myself nothing, that le might be :ll in all!

He rose, after a time, groped his way to bed, fell into a dreamy slumber and, the vision of his ungrateful son still haunting him, tossed and sobbed till morning. Ahl bitterly did he realize the sentence: 'Sharper far than a serpent's tooth to a parent's heart is the ingratitude of a child.' CHAPTER XVIII. RImoARD WINTER'S was an organization which, as the reader has already observed, repelled the bare idea of defeat. Once resolved, lie allowed noth- ing to step between him and the fulfilment of his purpose. Though deeply mortified at the ludicrous scene between his father and colonel Tarleton, he was not inclined to permit it to interfere for an instant with the relations existing between the colonel and himself. Early on the morning after the ball, he rode into Kingstree, gave his horse in care of the ostler, and entered the Palmetto. Colonel Tarleton had not yet risen, and it was thought he would not make his appearance till noon. The British troops, quartered upon the people, were already assembled upon the green, and discussing the incidents of the ball, which formed the principal topic of conversation. The towa was literally alive with idlers, groups of whom might be seen at almost every point, conversing upon the numberless nothings which the arri- val and appearance of the regulars suggested to their generally unoccupied     134 -       '.r:: 3WAtPy STED ; DIt THt DAYS minds. The multitude of these around the Palmetto, as the head-quarters of the British officers, was very large; while within the bar room, their number was far from insignificant. A group of officers held Possession of one corner, one of whom, a lieute- nant Bascomb, rose, as Richard Winter entered, and taking him aside, whis- pered confidentially: "My dear Winter, I have a message far you from colonel Tarleton." "Ah  What is it?" asked Richard. The colonel," said Bascomb, " desires me to request you to tender his regards to your, father, whomn he wishes to overlook the trifling contretemps which transpired last evening, to receive his humblest apologies for the part he took in it, and to forget that it ever occurred. As for yourself, he wishes to sec you as soon as he rises relative to some commission, the character of which he did not explain to me. He desired me also to state to you his re- grets for his share in the occurrence at the ball, with the request that you would make no allusion to it when you present yourself before him." : Colonel Tarleton's wishes shall be respected by me in every particular," returned Richard, inexpressibly rejoiced at this turn of affairs. "When can I have the honor of an interview?" ' At one o'clock," said Bascomb. "By the way, how are you off for com- panions?" "In what respect?" "The commission Tarleton has in view for you," returned the lieutenant, "relates, I suspect, to the policy he designs to pursue ,with the rebels. If so, you will want friends." "I understand you," said Richard. "Colonel Tarleton gave me yesterday a roving commission, with the privilege of selecting my own men. His plan is. I presume-" "Hush!" said the lieutenant, softly, " there may be ears around us other than loyal ones." "Right!" returned Richard, "I ami too careless. In times'like these, and in a neighborhood like this, there is no telling whom to count on. I'll see you again!" "Do so!" said the lieutenant, upon whose features flitted a peculiar smile as Winter passed from the inn. "Well, Bascomb," said one of his companions, as the lieutenant resumed his seat at the table, " does he nibble?" "Like a gudgeon," replied the lieutenant, with a quiet smile. "Father and son are equally gullible. The one is caught by a rebel corporal, the other by a loyal colonel." "And with the same bait-flattery!" laughed a third. "And promises," added a fourth. "We'll have to re-christen 'em." "I did that last night at the supper," said, the lieutenant. "You only acted as nomenclator to the old one," said the last speaker. "Nonsense! Griswold," returned the lieutenant. "It is easily seen that if I hadn't started it, nobody else would have thought of it. I'll wager wine for the regiment the colonel himself couldn't have given the old codger a bet- ter sobriuet." "A very safe bet," observed Griswold, "since it would never be decided. But, attention, gentlemen, for the christening." "Bear in mind, sir," added the lieutenant, with assumed seriousness, "that I did that last evening." "Aye?" said Griswold, inquiringly. "Whr t was it you denominated the old gentleman?" "'The Antiquated Gudgeon,'" returned the lieutenant, and a low laugh went up from around the table. "And I now propose," he added, in the \   OF MAiION AND HS MERRY MEN.         135 iame strain, " by way of heading off this aspiring usurper of my laurels, to immortalize the young one with the adhering title of The Young Gudgeon." "Lester," said Griswold, turning to an officer beside him, "you must be th  e ju in this case." "I am willing," returned Lester, with an assumed air of graciousness, " to take upon myself the duties of that high and responsible position, if it be the wish of the noble company present. What say you, sirs? You must an- swer individually. Is it your desire, lieutenant Bascomb-yours, lieutenant Ormsby-yours, sergeant Stanton-yours, adjutant Jones? Ah! it is? Very well, then. I consent. Now, counsellor Griswold, propound-my worship is waiting. Propound-propound." "My lud," began Griswold, "has my enemy, the nomenclator over the way," pointing to Bascomb at the other side of the table, " the right to anti- cipate nme-the right, my lud, if, I may so express myself, to take my words out of my mouth." "Unquestionably!" answered the umpire. "He has?" "Unquestionably 1" repeated the umpire, with ludicrous gravity. My lud, your decision not only astonishes, it overwhelms me." "Very good," observed the judge, phlegmatically. "I would add, my lud, that it all but annihilates me." "Ah!" gravely remarked the judge. "But, I would ask your ludship if I have not the right to recover myself %nd make myself good at the expense of my enemy the nomenclator over the way?" "Lawfully?" asked the judge. "Lawfully, my lud." "Unquestionably!" returned the judge with marked gravity. "Then, my lud, I claim that right, as well as your power to protect me in it." 'Take the first, I promise you the second!" said the judge, graciously. "Thank you, my noble lud. Thus then I recover myself at the expense of my enemy the nomenclator over the way." "Let us hear," said the judge. "My enemy, the nom6nclater over the way," began the other, has branded the old one with the sobriquet of the Antiquated (udgeon, and flatters him- self with the insane idea that it will adhere to him forever." "Insane ideas," remarked the judge, with great solemnity, " are common in this court, as well as in the statutes!" "Yes,-as you say, my lud-just so! The Antiquated Gudgeon is good, then, in the opinion of your lordship?" "Very good-for want of a better i" replied his lordship. "Ye., as you say, my lud-just so Hfor want of a better. I am about to produce the better one." "Produce it," said the judge, gravely. "Produce it!" said the company, anxiously, "-Produce it!" said Bascomb, with an air of supercilious defiance. "Here it is, my lud. I propose for your lordship's consideration, the hap- pier title of The Corporal's Gudgeon; for, if your lordship will please to re- member, it was-the corporal who landed him." "'The Corporal's Gudgeon,' is good, in fact very good 1" observed the judge, with an air of deep thoughtfulness. Better, by far, than the Antiquated Gudgeon?" "Much better," answered the judge; " in fact, a great deal better." "Your lordship's judicial wisdom," said counsellor Griswold, "is exempli- fied in this learned decision, as in everything else. I shall now proceed to make myself good at the expense of my enemy the nomenclator over the \     136       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS way, who has, as he felicitously expresses it, immortalized the young one with the adhering title of the Young Gudgeon.

"Produce it," said thejudge. Produce it,' said the company. "Produce it," said the lieutenant. "I stump him 1" "You hear him, my lord-he stumps me? I shall therefore demolish him. Have I your lordship's permission to do so?"  "You have," observed his lordship, graciously. "Thank you, my lord. I then submit for your lordship's consideration, the more. euphonious nominative of The Colonel's Gudgeon; for, if your lord- ship will please to remember, it is the colonel who proposes to land him." "' Th% Colonel's Gudgeon' is good," said the learned judge, " very good- in fact" he added, with a decided air, "better-much better-than 'The Young Gudgeon.' It is thus I decide. Now who is to pay for the wine which is necessary to refresh us after this solemn and trying case?" "The loser, my enemy, the nomenclator 'over the way; he is in for the costs," laughed Griswold. "A righteous decision!" exclaimed the others. 'Gentlemen," said the lieutenant, throwing a glance of ludicrous grief around the table, "as you justly observe-I'm in for it!" Seated at a table near them, was a young gentleman of Kingstree, who, while acquainting himself with the merits of a small bottle of port, had been quietly listening to the humorous colloquy of the officers. It was Sprague, who had come to the Palmetto for the purpose of picking up such informa- tion as he could of the movements and designs of the British. "I'll have some fun with these red coats," he muttered, turning his chair for the first time, so as to catch the eye of Lieutenant Bascom, with whom he was partially acquainted, having been introduced to him, as well as his companions, at the ball of the evening before. His movement arrested the attention of the lieutenant, who recognized him at a glance. "Ha! Sprague, how d'ye do? Just in time for a fresh bottle. Join us 1" This exclamation drew upon the young man the glance of the other parties at the table, who, remembering him, added their voices to that of the lieutenant, and Sprague accepted the invitation. "We have a rich joke," began the lieutenant,' rubbing his hands with great glee. "One that will make you roar yourself hoarse," said Griswold, laughingly "Yes, said Lester, "I have just decided it," "Ah?" observed Sprague, inquiringly. "Something rich, you say?" Very rich 1" returned Bascomb. "You've heard of the rebel corporal's trick upon old Winter?" "Certainly," returned Sprague. "Nothing else was talked of last night at the ball." "Exactly," said Bascomb. "Well, between ourselves, it won't go any further, of course? the colonel, with his usual impudence, is going to perform an operation upon young Winter, and as we have been let into the secret of the last, as every body has been into that of the first, we have been soubrquet- /g the hapless pair.' "Ah?" said Sprague, inquiringly. "Yes," interrupted Griswold, modestly; "but the joke of the affair em- anates on this side of the table." "True," said Lester, "I was the judge, and so decided it." Sprague glanced at them alternately with his keen, piercing eye, now lit up with an assumed expression of anticipative mirth.

"But to the point In consideration of the corporal's trick upon the senior Winter, we have nick-named him the Corporal's Gudgeon. Capital-isn't it?"  Very appropriate, indeed!" returned Sprague, with affected laughter, "and as witty as appropriate! And the other, you say-" be added, art- fully. "The other," said Griswold, scarcely able to contain himself at the yung man's praise, "I have, to use Bascomb's phrase, immortalized with the ad- hering title of the Colonel's Gudgeon 1" Capital " exclaimed Sprague, clapping his hands. "That will stick to him like a plaster, if there be any foundation for it!" "Oh! the best of foundations l" cried Griswold, glancing around the table. "What say you, gents-we can let Sprague into it. It's safe with him?" "Perfectly safei" said Bascomb. "I'll be answerable for him!"  "You are braver than I would be, under the circumstances!" muttered Sprague to himself. "Wiine-wine! thou art the key to unlock the secrets of empires-pray heaven! this be one of them!" "Ie can beh trusted," remarked Lester. "Certainly, let him into it!" The others nodded encouragingly, and Griswold went on. "You see" he began, bending over the table, aid bringing his lips close to the young man's ear, " the colonel is going to send the fool off to harrass the rebels, so as to get him out of the way." "Ah! so as to get him out of the way?" repeated Sprague, with an as- sumed smile. "And then-"                  j :' Then, he is going with a half dozen of us to the house, when we shall get the old ninny his father drunk as a blind toper, and then whip off Miss Winter for his mistress. Capital-isn't it?" "Capital?" repeated Sprague, with a sumed gaiety, "it's wonderful. When is the affair to come off?" "Dick Winter starts to-day-perhaps, not till to-morrow; and at night of the following day we visit the old gentlenlan. But, not a word!" "Oh!" answered Sprague, calmly. now that he had discovered the details of the plan, " you know you can trust in me But won't this be a rich, ffair?" Upon my word! it all but makes me burst Iinstead of singling them, you should have termed them the Gudgeon Family 1" "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the party, in chorus, "capital-capital r' "But," added Sprague, "the wine is out, and jokes like these make one dry. Landlord," he continued, seeing that personage hovering near, "there are seven of us!" "Yes, sir," returned the host, and seven bottles were speedily before them. "The object of the colonel," resumed Sprague, as the wine sparkled on the board, "is to flog the rebels in this neighborhood out of their fine senses?" "If he catches the rascals, yes," said Bascomb. "They may rely upon it," volunteered Lester, " that the colonel will give them some souvenirs worth remembering!" "No doubt of it-no doubt of it," observed Sprague. "But his object here is not a general one, I presume?" "No,a said Griswold, tossing off his glass, re-filling it, and slowly mutter- ing at the same time, far from it. Something more specific. He intends to remain here till Friday, when he shall have a reinforcement, and then it is his intention to cross over to Snow's Island, beard Marion in his den, and exterminate him and his men. He has recuivedA particular insrtlicCti3l1s from Cornwallis to that effect." "Marion is at Snow's Island, then?" asked Sprague, with an expression. of surprise.. "How did the colonel learn that?" 18     13S       THE SW'AMP STEED  OR THE DAYS  Somebody sent him word from Georg itown. Did you not know it?" Sprague shook his head. "' The fact is." he said, "Marion's whereabouts has long been a mystery to us. Once in a while we hear of him; but it is only when he throws himself right under our very nose: and before we can collect men enough to take him and his band, he is off. Is this Tarleton's first effort to take him?" "Say rather the twentieth!" returned Griswold, with a shrug. : And Marion has slipped through his fingers every time?" ' Every time," replied Griswold. "The truth in the matter is, this Marion '.a not been dubbed the Swamp Fox for nothing. Now he is here, now the(,' and you think you've got him: but when you come to lay your hand u  1oil hi, he isn't there!" '! In fact," s-aid Bascomb, "this is Tarleton's latest attempt to take him. He has undertaken it and failed so frequently, that Cornwallis begins to taunt hil withl inability. It is therefore a point of honor, as well as pride, witlh him, to make this trial a successful one." ' Which lie will not!" muttered Sprague to himself. "No doubt," he said aloud, " he will achieve Marion's capture, if he bends himself to it. His present large force-by the way, what-is your number?" he added ab- ruptly. !: Eight hundred," answered Bascomb. ' And Marion's?" "'It is supposed to be somewhere in the neighborhood of four hundred," answered Lester, to whom this question was addressed. ' And your expected reinforcements-" "Will amount to two hundred more." Which." said Sprauie, "added to your present force, will make a total of eleven hundred men. With such immense odds in his favor, Tarleton cannot help capturing the rebel. When did you say the reinforcement would arrive?" he added, carelessly. "On Friday." "Where from?'" "Georgetown." "By the line of the Black River?" ' Yes." "Under whom?" "Colonel Watson."' "Can he be relied on?" ' Who? Colonel Watson?" ': Yes." "Unquestionably." "Then there is no chance for the Swamp Fox," said Sprague, laughingly. "He'll lose his tail at last!" "Oh, it won't be so very easy a matter to take him, as you think" ob. served Bascomb. "Marion's position is in itself almost impregnable. It is a sort of natural fortress. Two hundred well armed and properly posted men could hold it'against an army." "In that case," returned Sprague, " what prospect of success has Tarleton with eleven hundred troops against the four or five hundred of Marion, es- pecially as the latter knows, no doubt, how to post his men judiciously?" "Ah!" replied Bascomb, knowingly, " that's the mystery!" "Then," said Sprague, "Tarleton don't intend to storm the island, after all?" "No," returned all of the officers at once, in the tone of men possessing a great secret. "Oh-he don't?" said Sprague, imitating their manner. "No," said Ba:-comb. Then bring;ing his lips close to the young man's ear,   t o"MAIttON AND HS METRY MEN.        139 he added, "his plan is to divide his nien, and attack the den of the Swamp Fox in five different points at once!" "Oh, I o!" exclaimed S'rague, with! an expres sion of profound surprise. "That's it, is it?" c Bascom and his companions nodded. "Why," cried Sprague, with affected rapture, "the idea is grand, beauti- ful, sublime!" "Is it not?" exclaimed the officers, exultantly. "Won't that bother the Swamp Fox, cunning as he is?" "It will not only bother, it will annihilate him!" exclaimed Sprague, ap- plaudingly. "Upon mny wod!  I scarcely know which most to admire- Tarleton's courage, or the magnificence of his plans. He'll turn out a gene- ral yet!" "Leave him alone for carving his way to greatness!" said Lester, know- ingly. "Now to frighten these drnnken bucks out of their wits!" muttered Sprague to himself. "By the way, gentlemen," he said aloud, "about this nick-name of young Winter. You must be cautious about letting it out just yet, as well as of keeping silent in regard to its author." "Ah!" observed Griswold, anxiously.  "Wherefore!" asked Bascom.' "Any danger in it?" demanded Lester. Sprague glanced at their anxious features alternately, and then answer- ed, slowly:  "The fact is, Richard Winter is one of the greatest dare-devils in South Carolina."         I "What then?" said Griswold, somewhat nervously. "What do we care for him?" continued Bascom  with an air of de- fiance. "What of that?" asked Lester, in a voice which trembled despite its ef- forts to appear firm. As to the other three officers, they appeared perfectly indifferent. "He is also," added Sprague, in a slow, measured tone, " a most expert swordsman." Griswold changed color. Moisture gathered upon his brow. Lester's fingers trembled convulsively, and his cheeks became pale. Bascom alone was unmoved. Sprague's caln, watchful eyes carefully observed each of these marked changes.                        " "More than this," he added, "Winter is of a wild, fearless, unforgiving spirit, dangerous even when unruffled, but fearfull and implacable when aroused. Ask his character of any man in this neighborhood, and he will' tell you he would rather have the ill will of a hundred imen for twenty years, than the anger of Richard Winter for a single hour." Lester and. Griswold now became absolutely livid. They could not speak; fear had struck them dumb. "Do you tell this to frighten us?" demanded Bascom, sternly. "On the contrary," replied Sprague, calmly, "I tell it to you out of pure good feeling, that you may not compromise yourselves. Should the names of the authors of the sobriquet come to his ears, their lives would not be worth the wine which is in this glass!" "For all that," said Bascom, without altering a muscle, "if he should ask me if I were its author, I would answer him yes, and risk the consequences. Well, fellow, what do you want?" This question was put to the landlord, who now approached the table, and was standing beside hirm.     "O       THE SWAMP STEED'; OR THE DAYS "You desired me to let you know when Colonel Tarleto i -ose, so you could be the first to present yourself before him!" "Well?" said Bascom, haughtily. "Well, sir," added Barker, "Colonel Tarleton has risen, and is now making his toilet." "Very well," said Bascom, without thanking him. The landlord moved away, muttering- "D-n his haughty insolence! I'll punish him for it yet! Didn't I overhear his ridicule of Dick Winter, and won't I tell him of it? Oh, no- of course not!" 'Now, Sprague," said Bascom,.tranquilly, "in case this affair should come in its true light to Winter'sears, and he should take the trouble to inquire into its author, you have my full permission to tell him that the name of the individual is Lieutenant George Bascom, of his majesty's ninety-third. Good morning, sir!" So saying, he rose from the table, and, accompanied by his companions,  passed from the bar room. "You are a brave fellow!" muttered Sprague, following him with his eyes, and worth forty Richard Winters. As for me, now that the coast is clear, I must hurry home, write Marion the details of. Tarleton's plan, and at the same time despatch a note to Somers, warning him of the danger of his be- trothed. It strikes me forcibly," he continued, as he quitted the inn, "that Colonel Watson and his two hundred troops will not make their appearance here on Friday. I may be wrong, but such is my opinion!" Meanwhile, Richard Winter, with an energy quite in keeping with his character, mingled among the numerous idlers congTegated in the neighbor- hood of the Palmetto, proposed the organization of a band under the name and style of the Tory Rangers, drew up a code of laws, persuaded some five and twenty young fellows of his own stamp to sign it, nominated himself for their leader, and, his dare-devil merits being universally known, was. elected without a dissenting voice.  Ere noon arrived, he had completed the necessary details for the manage- ment of his band. These accomplished, he proceeded to the Palmetto, where he waited impatiently for the signal to present himself before Colonel Tarle- ton. An hour floated by ere he received the desired permission. At the end of that period, a young adjutant appeared before him, saying: "Colonel Tarleton desires to see you, immediately." Winter bowed his thanks, hastened up stairs, turned into a chamber facing the green-the same in which we have previously seen him, in company with Frederick Crampton-and the next moment was face to face with Colonel Tarleton. The latter was alone, and saluted him cordially. Take a chair, Winter," he said, familiarly, at the same time throwing himself upon a seat near a small table, wlch was covered with maps, papers and writing implements of every description. "I gave you yesterday," he began, " a roving commission to harrass and annoy, in the name of his ma- jesty, the rebels of this section of the province. But I have since heard so much of your superior abilities, that I have decided upon changing that com- mission to one of a higher character; that is to say, I have thought it best to send you to Cornwallis, in order that he may have the immediate advan- tage of such services as you can render him in his efforts to crush this bold and insolent rebellion. This, it appears to me, will be of greater and mpre instantaneous advantage to you, than the other, as it will bring you at once under the eye of the commander-ip-chief) and throw you into familiar con- tact with one who is both capable of appreciating and rewarding your abili- ties, at their true worth."   OP MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         141 " ow ca i I express my gratitude for this noble generosity--' stammered Richard, half wild at this turn of his good fortune. "By saying nothing about it," interrupted Tarleton, smilingly. "In one word-do you know that I prefer monosyllablic replies to my interrogato- ries?-how does my plan suit you? Answer me in one word!" "Well," returned Richard. "Then we will consider it settled," said Tarleton, taking a couple ofsealed pa- pers from the table and handing them to his auditor. "Here are two letters, which you will present to Cornwallis; one ofthem concerns yourself,the other is a private despatch relative to my own affairs. You will present them both to the commander-in-chief, with my compliments, and act according to his instructions. I need not say that both favor and fortune are now in your own hands." Richard bowed his thanks. ' By the way, how many followers can you count upon?"           -  "Twenty-five," answered Richard. "All stout, bold, determined and firm adherents of the king?" "Every man of them." "Enough. That is all that is required. What are your arrangemients- immediate?" "Immediate." "You could start, then, at a moment's warning?" "If so ordered-yes." "Very well, indeed!" exclaimed Tarleton, with an air of satisfaction. "I find I have not overrated your abilities. I shall not call upon you to-day. But at the earliest of to-morrow's dawn you had better be on your way, ac- companied by your troop. You will find the commander-in-chief near Beat- tie's Ford, on the banks of the Pedee. The sooner you reach him, as the in- telligence in my despatch is of considerable moment, the heartier will be your reception. "I will start at day break," said Richard. "Enough. Now for other matters. I owe Mr. Winter, your respected father, an apology for my last evening's rudeness-nay, don t interrupt me. I owe him an apology, and, like any other debt, it must and shall be paid. Unfortunately, my duties are numerous, ahn my leisure moments few. Nevertheless, if I cannot pay Mr. Winter my debt to-day, I can and .will to- morrow. Will you oblige me by stating to your father, that I will do my- self the honor to wait upon him at eight to-morrow evening? Ah I you will? Thank you I Now, then, as I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again for some time, let us shake hands. Be assured, sir, that my interest with the commander-in-chief shall ever be exerted in your favor. Adieu!" . He pressed the young tory's hand warmly, then resuming his seat, busied himself with the papers on, the table before him. Richard retired, wild, trembling and confused at his good fortune. Hur- rying his men together, he notified them of his arrangeInents, bade them be in the saddle at the door of the Palmetto half an hour before dawn of the following day, and then mounting his horse, drove home as if racing ivith a thunder cloud. Mr. Winter received the announcement of Colonel Tarleton's promised visit first with surprise, and then with pride. The latter feeling, however, was somewhat lessened as he heard of Richard's intended departure. This was a blow for which he was scarcely prepared. Mr. Winter's fondness for his son had degenerated into a weakness. With all his faults, Richard was to him the apple of his eye. To look upon his " darling boy," was to him the acme of human felicity. Not to have the privilege of seeing him at least once a day, was unutterable misery. And now that he was going away, and for an indefinite time--the bare thought was frightful! And while Richard *^     "2       'THE SWAMP STEED; OR TrE DAYS3  harried to Es room, to make the necessary preparations for his journey, hi{ father retired to his chamber to weep. Let us respect a weakness founded on love!      . To Amy, the intelligence of Tarleton's coming was far from gratifying. At first, it struck her like the announcement of an approaching misfortune. As she reflected upon it, however, as she recalled Tarleton's libidinous manner, his brazen effrontery, and the insulting proposal he had had the impudence- to make to her at the ball,-as she weighed his intriguing character, his self- imposed visit-his pretext for getting Richard out of the way-a suspicion, faint at first, but gradually becoming clearer and bolder and stronger, of lhe- truth, stole over and appalled her. She shuddered as she thought of her utter delencelessness in case her suspicions should become realities. To lay her fears before Richard, would, she was aware, only be to subject herself to ridicule and insult; to explain them to her father, in the hope that he would hearken to her with respect,' would be utterly futile. In this position, what. was she to do? A thought struck her. She would call on Mrs. Brunton, tell her of her fears, invite her to spend the evening with her, -and give her, at the same time, a delicate hint to bring a male friend or two with her. This resource appeared to Amy her only one. She spent the remnainder'of the day, the evening and the night, in trying to discover another or a better one, but failed. When she arose, Richard had already taken his departure. When she descended to the breakfast room, she found her father in tears., Swallowed up in fondness for his son, Mr. Winter had nothing for his daughter but harshness, frowns and monosyllables. As the morning wore away, however, the old gentleman's severe manner relaxed, and he became' somewhat conversible. Taking advantage of this calm, Amy proposed and obtained his consent to her inviting Mrs. Brunton, to help her do the honors of .the evening. Overjoyed at this permission, she ordered the carriage, rode up to Kingstree, called upon her friend, and in a few hurried words laid everything before her. Mrs. Brunton heard her quietly to the end, and-declined! She was sorry, very sorry; but her aversion to Colonel Tarleton was such, that nothing in the world would induce her to be seen for a moment in his society. As for. Amy's fears, she considered them, if she must speak plainly, weak, and with- out foundation. Colonel Tareton, though an unprincipled libertine, would not dare to take any forcible steps for the accomplishment, of his designs. upon a lady's honor. The idea was preposterous! Atrry was stupified at this unexpected refusal. She surveyed the widow for a few moments with a mingled expression of astonishment and despair; then rising, she stammered confusedly her regrets at having disturbed her, and with a trembling air took her leave. As she threw herself into the carriage, a sense of desolation crept over her. The observations of Mrs. Brunton, far from reassuring, filled her with still leeper alarm. As though it had been a whisper from her guardian angel, the conviction now rose up before her that the widow, instead of being a friend, was an abiding enemy. But ibr what? Amy tried in vain to solve the enigma. Still, she was none the less satisfied that Mrs Brunton was an ad- versary of whom she should beware. But she had half thought the same of Richard-and of her father! But were THEY her foes? They were cruel, harsh, unsympathizing; but did they, could they, really hate her? No: it was impossible: for was she not allied to them by blood-the sister of the one, the* daughter of the other? The idea was ridiculous. Why, then, might not her suspicion of the widow, founded as it was on no juster basis, be equally as erroneous and unjust? And yet, poor girl! she flt that everything was crumbling and giving way beneath her; that her old, best, and only in tvis were one by one deserting-   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         143 her; that Richard cared nothing for her, and only regarded her as a target for his ill humors, and as a ladder by which he might mount to wealth, inlfltu- ence and power; and that her father, carried away by his insensate love for' Richard, by whom he was guided in all things, even in his hatreds and affec- tions, looked upon her, only as a thing to be used for his son's advancement, and not as a legitimate claimant on his confidence or sympathy. And why was all this? Because of her acknowledged love Ifr Somers? It must be so. For previous to that, she had had a small share in her father's affections, but not a shadow of it since. Richard, too, was rough but kind; but since his discovery of her partiality for Neil, his heart seemed turned against her.. And now an old friend and confidant, Mrs Brunton, had also for some inexplicable cause, joined in the chase to worry and run her down. While striving to analyze the reason of this conduct on the part of her fair friend, a thought, wild, fierce and burningly intense, came up from one of the long-locked cells of her memory, and flashed across her startled brain like a line of fire. She remembered having heard it hinted that Mrs. Brunton was herself in love with the handsome planter, and had resolved to win him! Could this be true? If so, then it was not a friend she had in the accorn- plished widow, but a-rival! This, then, explained the cause of Mrs. Brunton's coldness, of her waning friendship, ofher refusal! This, then, was the lkey to her conviction that 'the widow was her enemy I As these thoughts beset her, Amy gave way for a moment to a feeling of despair. Meanwhile, the carriage was slowly conveying her homeward. Suddenly, in the midst of her heart's gloom, a star appeared-Somers. As the image of her lover passed before her mental vision, despair sprang from her breast and-slunk away; the pearly tears which had been coursing icily down her pale cheeks became a warm, gushing shower; her heart, but now heavy and oppressed, bounded with elasticity, fullness and hope-Somers was hers-hers only Ip  To console her for her brother's cruelty, had she not Somers' gentleness; to sooth her for her father's neglect, had she not Somers' fondness; to pay her for the sufferings she endured at the hands of her relatives and friends, had she not Somers' constant love? What need then of fear, of anxiety, for the pretensions of her designing rival? Away with them! She would think of them no more-she would forget all, everything that might render her unhappy; she would remember only the unfaltering love of Somers-her Somers-hers only I / "But Tarleton?"And as this sentence crossed her, her brow once again grew dark. "This hated Tarleton!"Were Somers near, she would not tremble for fifty'Tarletons! If she but had a father that cared for Jer! If she but had a friend in whom she could trust-a male friend, a friend who wore a sword and had a noble heart I  And with the rising of this thought, she unconsciously put her headl through the carriage window, and glanced down the road. Had heaven heard her wish, and sympathizing with her grief, kindly sent her what she so earnestly desired. Scarcely twenty paces off she beheld one of the bravest, cleverest, and most generous minded gentlemen of Carolina, leisurely approaching. It was our old acquaintance, the exquisite, mounted on a small, beautifully shaped' roan, on his way to Kingstree. Their eyes met, and Crampton, with that quiet case for which he was so   ' remarkable, calmly lifted his hat and saluted her with a graceful bow. Amy bade the driver pause, and the exquisite comprehending by this that she desired to speak with him, quietly reihed up beside the carriage windows -     "4       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "Weally, Miss Wintah," he began, " this is an unexpected pleasah I How did you enjoy yourself at the ball? Do you know I have a compliment for you? But I musn't tell it, I suppose," he added drawlingly; "it would make you vain. Where is Wichard?"  Then perceiving an air of sadness upon Amy's countenance, he said- "I'm afwaid, Miss Wintah, something twoubles you! You have had some bad news? Can I be of any service to you?" he added, in a more subdued tone. "Ah! you have something to tell me? Nothing gone wrong with Soinahs, I hope?" he continued bringing his ear close to her, and considerate- ly throwing his eyes upon the ground. The exquisite, as the reader is already aware, was the mutual friend and confidant of the lovers, and Amy made no scruple of laying before him the secret of her troubles. When she had concluded, Crampton observed: "I am vewy much obliged to you, .Miss Wintah, for this expwession of your confidence. As to the individual under consideration, if he attempts anything ungentlemanly, let him look out. Make yourself easy. I will see a friend or two, with your permission, and make such awangements as will se- cure you from injuwy."             '  "I expucted nothing less from you my friend!" said Amy, With emotion. "How shall I ever be able to evince my gratitude?" ' Alh! don't mention it," replied the exquisite. "It gives me the gweatest pleasure imaginable to have the ability to show the high wespect I entertain for you. Keep up your heart, Miss Wintah--evewything will go well, depend upon it. Au revoir!" He lifted his hat gracefully, and bidding the driver proceed, passed on, leaving his fair fiiend with a lighter heart than he had found her. As he rode into Kingstree, he directed his horse to the house of yOaig Sprague, with whom he was on a familiar footing. The latter was about to leave the house, as the exquisite drew up at the garden gate. "Ah! Crampton," cried Sprague, "well met. Do you know I was just going in search of you?" "Thank fortune I my de-ah fellow, you didn't have to go far. Lead the way to your woom. I want your advice on a matter of sewious intewest." "This way, then," returned Sprague. They entered a small two story cottage in the centre of the lawn, passed up to the second floor, and turned into the front chamber. "Take a seat," said Sprague, handing his visitor a chair, and throwing him- self upon another. "It appears that we were in quest of each other?" "Ah--yes," returned Crampton. "I have just had an interview wtth a young lady fwiend in whom I feel a stwong intewest. She has some weason to suppose herself in danger, and as I should nevah forgive myself if any ac- cident should befall her when it was in my powah to pwevent it, I have come to ask your assistance for a few hours after dark." Sprague looked at him thoughtfully for a few moments, and then observed: "This is very singular! I was about to hunt after you, to make the same request." "You?" said the exquisite, with an expression of surprise. "Are you not quizzing me now?" "Not in the least. But who is your lady?" "Miss Wintah! And yours, nmy deah fellow?" "Miss Winter." "Now, Spwague, you are quizzing me!" "Not at all." "Now you astonish me  The young lady has been to see you, then?"

"But let us compare notes, and then we will be sure." He then related what he had hearld from the officers at the Palmetto. The exquisite was both astonished and indignant at the recital.

EABLY in the evening, that is to say, between eight and nine o'clock, Colo- nel Tarleton, accompanied by Lieutenant Bascom, appeared at the door of the Winters, and wa shown at once into the drawing room. Mr. Winter receivfd him with an obsequious politeness which, while it disgusted Tarleton, compelled Bascom to bite his lips till they bled, to pre- vent him from bursting into laughter.  As Amy entered, Tarleton and his companion, struck with her dified air, brilliant beauty and winning gracefulness, involuntarily rose to do her homage. Amy's was of that rare loveliness which shines to greater advantage in the drawing than in the ball room. Her movemqnts were easy, her manner quiet and subdued, and her voice low, musical and clear. The contrast between father and daughter was very striking. The former was servile, pretentious, and unmistakably vulgar; the latter was calm, self- possessed, modest, and in her person, as in her bearing, bore herself like one accustomed to move in good society. Tarleton, with admirable tact, opened the conversation in such a manner as to make it general; and when he had succeeded in placing all parties at their ease, gradually and imperceptibly drew Mr. Winter and the lieutenant into a discussion, in which he left them, and then turned his attention to Amy. The latter, deeming it her best policy to be courteous and agreeable, re- ceived him pleasantly, and they whiled away an hour in charming converse upon the ball, Kingstree, the province, the country, England, science, litera- ture, art, and--(it was the colonel who broached it)-love  Here they paused, Amy, because the colonel set her the example; and Tarle- ton, because love was his chief hobby, and because he wished to gather in his forces, or, in other words, to collect his thoughts which the previous topics had sent rambling, for a grand charge: for, be it understood, the introduetion of love into a conversation with a pretty woman, was with Tarleton, equivalent to making her an offer of his heart without his hand. "Love, Miss Winter," he began, "is the hope, the dream, of youth. It ennobles man, and angelizes woman. It is, at once, the ource of bliss and misery; bliss, if responded to, misery, if unreturned. Ah!" he added, with a sigh, "no misery like that of unrequited love!" Amy at once comprehended that Tarleton was merely acting, and she guaged her reply accordingly. "It appears to me," she said, "that love is oftener professed, than experi- enced. People talk of love as they talk of nobleness, as they talk of glory: without ever experiencing either." "That" returned Tarleton, understanding her, [ is unfbrtunately true. But are we, therefore, to discredit that there are some hearts, honest, fervid and faithful in their attachments, even when they express them?" "Humanity forbid!" returned Amy. "But they are rare." "I'll not dispute that," said Tarleton, laughingly. "But if rare, should they not, like other rarities, be treasured?" "By whom?" asked Amy. Tarleton was nonplussed. This was not the kind of answer he had expected Nevertheless, he proceeded. "Say by her to whom he makes confession of his love?" "What if she desired it not?" replied Amy, calmly. "It is not in woman to live without loving," returned Tarleton, "as i is not in man.'   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         147 "But his love may not please her," observed Amy, with a freezing smile. ' In that case, must she perforce receive it?" "Perforce, no I Love knows not force; it requires passions only that are spontaneous." "Say," continued Amy, " that she has a prior love already? Of what in- terest then to her is the newer rarity?" "But she can sympathise with him who offers it-she can at least respect it and him." "No," returned Amy, coldly. Tarleton looked at her with an expression of surprise. "You amaze me," he said. "Possibly," rejoined Amy. "I have no faith in ungenerous attachments." "What do you mean by ungenerous attachments?" asked Tarleton. "Attachments selfishly formed to supplant another." "But all attachments are selfish," said Tarleton. "A genuine one must be so, if it would be pure," returned Amy, quietly. "But it is also generous; for it provides for the happiness of the two parties embraced in it. An ungenerous attachment, on the contrary, is simply and purely selfish. It looks for its own happiness alone, and meanly strives to attain it, first, at the expense of her to whom it' is offered, who does not de- sire it, and who is already happy in the possession of another, and secondly, at the expense of him who loves, and trusting in her truth and honor, has re- posed his love and faith in her keeping." "And yet," said Tarleton, with an affectation of deep feeling, "such an attachment may be honest, and spring from a free and generous soul. Man is not the arbiter of his own feelings. He cannot say to his heart, love this maiden, or that. His heart is free and independent of his will. It wanders when and where it pleases, and happy, thrice happy he, whose heart and mind fall on the same fair form I But say they alight on one already chosen? What then? Shall he have from her not one sweet smile? not one glance of pity? Is it fair that his loving heart, meeting with no response, should wither and decay, and his bright mind, sympathizing with his stricken breast, be plunged into eternal darkness?" "Woman," replied Amy, " is answerable for the consequence of such pas- sions only as she intentionally creates. It would be ungenerous to charge her with any others, or 'to expect her to pay the price of them." "What-not one sweet smile," said Tarleton, reproachfully, "not one kindly glance, for so much misery?" Amy shook her head quietly. "No," she said. "Ah  Miss Winter, you are pitiless!" "No," repeated Amy, "I am just. Her smiles, her kindly glances, are not her own, but his to whom she is wedded, or affianced. She cannot give what does not belong to her, without committing a crime." Tarleton bit his lip. He felt that, in Miss Winter, he had found, not a soft, credulous country girl, whom he could twist around his finger with a word but one equal to the city's keenest witted belles, one who, in intellectual warfare, was his superier far. Nevertheless, he determined she should be his; he had made up his mind, as well as his preparations, to this effect. Accustomed to triumph, his pride instinctively revolted at the idea of defeat. Passion also influenced him to this decision. His first glimpse of Amy at the ball, had aroused desire, and de- termined him upon making her his victim, From that moment to the pres- ent, in his thoughts and his dreams, her image had been constantly before him, firing his senses and inciting him to her conquest. Even while she spoke, his roving eyes wandered insolently over her slender yet symmetrical form, guessing at the charms hidden beneath the folds of her     "8        THE SWATP STEID; OR THE DAYS pearl colored dress, and glittering with joy at the anticipation of approach ing dalliance. Meanwhile, Bascom, prepared beforehand, performed his part to admira- tion. In the discussion between himself and Mr. Winter, he spoke so loud, fast and energetically, and kept up such a running fire of words as to effect- ually succeed in the o3ject for which it had been begun, viz: to enchain the old gentleman's attention, and thus give Tarleton full play in the prosecution of his designs upon the daunghter. In-this the lieutenant was unconsciously assisted by the ambitious old tory himself, who had not forgotten the instructions of his son, and who innocently deluded himself with the fancy, that the colonel might, after all, fall a victim to his daughter's wit and beauty, and, in due season, make her an offet of his hand. Tarleton resumed. "I do not regard affairs of the heart in that light," he said, with a pleasant air. "Love is too important to my happiness to be thus easily set aside. Let us look at it in its true light. Man was. uade to love, woman to be loved. Now, if-"He paused suddenly, placed his hand to his brow, and ap- peared to be suffering. "Why," he said abruptly, "how oppressive is the atmosphere  I'm afraid it will give me a vertigo. Suppose we tae a walk in the garden? The air is freer and purer there!" Amy hesitated, and appeared embarrassed. "My father-" she began, timidly. "Oh," said Tarleton, interrupting her, " he will go with us, certainly." And he addressed Mr. Winter to that effect.  The latter replied, " he would be but too happy ;" and Basom, previously drilled answering in the same strain, Amy, seeing there was no help for it, took the proffered arm of Tarleton, and they entered the garden. The night was calm, pleasant and beautiful; the sky of a clear, pure blue, and gemmed with myriads of sta's; and the moon bathed the garden; the high road, the adjoining fields, the neighboring woods and hills and moun- tains in a rich flood of silver. The parties had scarcely descended the steps of the piazza, however, when Mr. Winter received a stunning blow from some invisible hand, and fell with a low groan, upon the gravelled walk. Amy started, and screamed, for a sense of the reality of her danger was now manifest; but ere she could turn to retreat, Tarleton's arm had encircled her waist, and lifted her from off her feet. She struggled to free herself uttering at the same moment a prolong- ed and piercing scream. ' Silence!" cried Tarleton, sternly, and placing his hand hastily over her mouth; "silence I or, I'll strangle you!" ' Away with her," said Bascom, "or the slaves will be upon us." Follow me," returned Tarleton, lifting his victim in his arms, and hurry- ing to the road. But in raising the resisting girl, he was compelled to us both hands; and taking advantage of this, Amy again rent the air with loud shrieks for help. They were by this time on the highway. "Where are the horses?" cried Tarleton. "Here," said a voice, under a tree, on the roadside, which he recognized as that of Griswold. "Hold her till I mount," said Tarleton, giving the screaming girl into the hands of Bascom. The Aext moment he was in the saddle. Congregated around him were three officers, viz: Bascom, Griswold and Lester. He had scarcely taken his seat, however,.when a hissing sound rang in his ear, then a sharp, benumbing pain seized him in the right shoulder, and the next instant there were two quick-, echoing reports,   OF MARION AND HS MEiRY MEN.         149 A low groan broke from Griswold, whose hand was upon Tarleton's bridle. He tottered back a step or two, threw up his arms with a gesture of surprise and affright, uttered a faint sigh, and fell back upon the road-dead. "I am shot in the arm!" exclaimed Tarleton, with a cry of rage. "Hand her up here, Bascom, and then to horse. We are beset!" As these words passed his lips-as Bascomb was in the act of lifting Amy to the saddle-as Lester, trembling with terror, was hastily placing his foot in the stirrup, two mounted horsemen darted, sword in hand, from behind the shadow of a knoll, about ten yards off, to attack them. At the same instant a hurried patter of hoofs was heaird upon the road as if approaching with lightning speed. "Yield, cowards; villains!" cried the nearest horseman. "Ha! I know that voice!" exclaimed Bascom, forcing Amy across Tarle- ton's saddle, stepping back a few paces, boldly unsheathing his blade, and Shouting-"Fly, colonel-fly! Lester and I will cover your retreat!" By this time Lester was in his saddle, and his weapon unsheathed. "Enough " answered Tarleton, wheeling his holse. "I would remain, but my sword-arm is useless " "ook to him, Fred," cried the chivalrous Spraguo, "I'll take care of these vascals l" "Take care of yourself, traitor!" shouted Bascom, rushing on him. "I'll pin you to your horse!" "Aye," answered Sprague, jerking his rein; "if you can!"As he spoke his horse suddenly glided off, and Bascom's uplifted weapon descended upon the ground. "Where are you, Fred?" cried Sprague, talding a momentary glance up the road. "Here," answered that gentleman, "twying to persuade this individual to say his pwayers! I feel an intewest in him!" The exquisite and Lester were testing each other's skill at blood letting. Instead of following Sprague's order, and pushing after Tarleton, he had turn- ed in self-defence upon the officer, who had intercepted him. For this piece of impertinence, as Crampton termed it, Lester had already paid in part the price, in the shape of three dangerous wounds. Sprague pressed hard upon his opponent the lieutenant, who defended him- self bravely as well as with great skill, striving at the same time with all his power to mount his horse, whose bridle he held in his left hand. ".Bascom," said Sprague, taking pity at length upon the lieutenant's infe- rior position, "your share in this rascally abduction, renders you unworthy of an honest man's notice. Nevertheless, you are courageous; and as that is a redeeming quality, I will forego my superior advantage, and meet you on foot " With these words, he leapt from his saddle, and the next moment their blades were closed in a more equal form of combat. Of the two, Bascom was perhaps the better swordsman, but this advantage was neutralized to a considerable degree by the blindness of his rage. Sprague, on the contrary, was wholly self-possessed; he parried the fierce thrusts of his adversary, and lunged in return, with a coolness and energy which in- creased the lieutenant's passion, while it compelled his admiration. The combat was sharp, brief and decisive.^ Enraged at his adversary's sang froid, Bascom attempted to drive him from the firm position which he had main- tained from the first; failing in this, he next made an effort, by entwining his sword with that of his enemy, throwing all his strength into his wrist, and all his elasticity into his muscqes, to disarm him. But Sprague's sinews were- wiry and supple, and successfully resisted the movement. In his turn, Sprague now pressed upon the lieutenant. The latter, after an ineffectual struggle to hold himself, was at length compelled to give ground.     150       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS While stepping backward, his foot struck against Griswold's body, which was lying across the road. The shock was so sudden and unexpected, that he lost for a moment at once his guard, his equilibrium, and his presence of mind. That instant was taken advantage of by his adversary, whose blade imme- diately made for itself a passage through his breast and worked its way with the speed of light through the heart and flesh, coming out, reeking with blood, at his back. The lieutenant fell, with a deep groan, and as his head touched the ground, his eyes glared for a moment up at his conqueror, who stood over him with an expression which had in it more of grief than triumph. "The game is with you," he cried, faintly. "That was a home pierce!" "I never shed blood before," said Sprague; "and believe me I regret the chance which brought me into collision with so brave a man as yourself. You are dying, sir, I fear." "Never mind," said the lieutenant, faintly. "It's all right, I suppose. You have only done by me, as I should have done by you." "Can I do anything for you?" said Sprague, stooping down beside him, and taking his listless hand in his own. "No-you are a good fellow!" returned the lieutenant, the glare passing away from his eyes, and its place usurped by a pleasant light, "it's too late. I haven't got breath enough to hold out two minutes. When you see Miss Winter, ask her-to-pardon me-for this-this-God have mercy-H re- pent--I-  " His lips ceased to move. There was a thick, gurgling sound-a quivering of the body-a faint sigh, and Sprague felt that another soul had gone that night to give its account to God. Meanwhile, Frederick Crampton, determined to return home with a sound skin, as well as to teach his antagonist a lesson he would not soon forget, was energetically engaged in making marks, as he termed them, upon captain Lester, whose efforts to return the favor were more remarkable for their earnestness and number than their success. "My deah fellow," observed the exquisite, with the utmost nonchalance, "your skill is not equal to your desi-ah. I find you engaged in a vewy shocking and ungentlemanly business. Ah! see," he added, as he touched him with the point of his rapier in the left breast, making the seventh wound he had given him, "your vewy body blushes at your meanness I What would your mother say if she should see you? Ah! you are a pitiful fellow I Take care, don't slip from your saddle, or you will inevitably bweak your neck I What-it is wet, is it? Then pweserve yourself in your seat, and don't give the fear-sweat an opportunity to creep between the leather of your saddle, and the cloth of your bweeches. What-it is not sweat, but the blood of your seven wounds? Ah! that alters the case. But, my deah fellow, in order that you may not fall in consequence of your seven wounds, I will do you the honor to give you another; so that, if you dwop, it will be under the cwushing influence of eight, which is a vewy good number, and quite enough to dwive a man from his cours-ah, and compel him to say his pwayers. I can't do it? Ah! my deall fellow, you shouldn't say that. It isn't gentle- manly in the society that I move in, to fib. You are aware of the fact that I can mark you when, where, and as fwequently as I please. I am a d-d puppy, am I? Well, if I am, my deah fellow, I know how to bark, don't I -and to bite-eh?" This latter clause was' put at the same moment with his rapier, the first taking effect upon the captain's ear, the second upon his shoulder blade, which was pierced to the bone, making his eighth wound. "A l!" continued the exquisite, in the same tantalizing tone, "that makes you squeal, don't it? You see now, that if I am a puppy, I can bite most fuwiously. You'll make me sweat for t'at'? No, you won't, my deah fel-   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         151 low. I never sweat. I wear flannel, which you know absorbs moisture. Ah! that was a well aimed lunge, and if your hand were not so outwageous- ly unsteady, it might have touched me. What? it did touch me? Non- sense, my deah fellow-your head, like your body, is getting light; you wock in your saddle, like a dwunken man-your optics, like your hand, can no longer be depended upon! Ah! vewy good--vewy good indeed-that was an excellent stwoke, but it didn't quite come home!" he tauntingly exclaim- ed, as he evaded a thrust which just graced his side. "Half an inch more, my deah fellow, and you would have drawn your first blood. I'll show you how these things are done by those who understand it. It's a vewy bewful pwoccss, I assure you!"So saying, he drew back his nimble-footed charger a few paces; touched him lightly in the flanks, and started him on full run towards the captain; but instead of proceeding directly at him, he quietly guided the fleet animal off to the left, and within three or four yards of his antagonist, who, unable to divine his intentions, wheeled to meet him. This being exactly what the exquisite wished and expected, he at this moment pulled in his rein, and with such sudden fierceness as to almost throw the spirited animal upon his haunches; his forelegs, shod with bright new irons, oscillated for an instant in the air, when the exquisite-rising in his saddle and throwing out his weapon-touching him in the flanks, they. fell forward upon the hips of the captain's horse, which they tore fearfully down to the very fetlocks, just as the exquisite's rapier penetrated the captain's neck. That's the ninth and lastl" he tauntingly observed. "Nine is a bewful number! You will never want anothah-never!" Shrieking with pain, Lester's horse bounded forward a few steps, when it reared, shook off its bleeding rider, quivered, again fell on its feet, and then as if stricken with madness, darted off, screaming with agony and terror, and was quickly out of sight. The exquisite now dismounted, and holding the bridle in his hand, ap- proached his antagonist, who from the moment of his fall had made no sign. "Are you alive, sir?" demanded Crampton. The captain made no reply. His face was turned upward ; the eyes open and staring; the neck and left cheek crimsoned, while around him the dusty earth was saturated with blood. Crampton bent down and laid his hand upon the officer's breast. There was no action of the heart in response. His fall and the loss of blood had killed him. The exquisite sighed. His heart was firm and pitiless while in the combat, Now that it was over, and his adversary dead, he could scarcely refrain from weeping. 'Ah!" he murmured, "how his mother will weep when she hears of this!" I see you have killed your man, Fred!" exclaimed a voice near him, which he instantly recognized. "Yes. Spwague," returned the exquisite, mournfully. "But it's vewy shocking. I can't bear to think of it. Where's that other fellow-Bascom?" "Where Griswold is, where Lester is, where the villaifn Tarleton should be!" "In eternity?" "Yes."  The exquisite shuddered. "H0ow their mothers will weep when they hear of it 1" he observed with a sigh. "You have a brave, considerate, and gentle heart, Fredl" exclaimed Sprague, with an expression of admiration. "But come, tohorse-Miss Winter is stil in danger. Hark!" He paused, as did his compani mn and listens .     152       THE SWAMP STEED; OR TPE DAYS There was a din, as if of conflict; a low murmuring roar made up of shouts and of screams, and of sudden and irregular discharges of guns, and of heavy tramping of feet as of many men rushing wildly to and fro, and of the quick echoing patter of hoofs: The two young men exchanged glances. "'Tis a battle?" said the exquisite, inquiringly. "Say rather 'tis a surprise, which will soon terminate in a rout!" returned Sprague, with the air of a man who knows more than he tells. "Led on by whom?" asked the exquisite. "By whom but by him the fear of whose night surprises, ever keeps the king's troops in a state of constant alarm." "By him?" demanded Crampton, his eyes sparkling with a feverish anxi- ety to be gone. "Bwavo! We have fwends, then, and Miss Wintah may yet be saved. As for me, I should like to help punish her abductor." "And as for me," said Sprague, with animation, "I should like to help drive him and his scarlet pack from Kingstree." "Do you say so, Spwague? To horse, then!" "Aye, to horse 1" With these words, they sprang into their saddles and darted-forward as if life and death hung on the footsteps of their steeds. While these incidents were transpiring, Tarleton urged on his charger with its double burden towards the village, between himsqlf and which stretched a winding highroad of one and a half miles. Under ordinary circumstances, the accomplishment of this distance would have been an easy as well a pleasant feat. But in the present instance Tarle- ton found it both difficult and painful. This arose from two causes: the screams and unceasing struggles of Miss Winter to release herself from his grasp and precipitate herself to the earth; and the agony of his wounded arm which hung like a useless appendage by his side. - He was therefore compelled to restrain the efforts of his fair prisoner with his remaining arm, and to guide his steed with one hand. But as this arm, thanks to Amy's energetic struggles, was continually moving every which way, and as each movement correspondingly jerked his hand, and his hand the bridle which it held, the consequence was his horse, turning now to the right now to the left, then in a half circle, now in a whole one, then bunting up against a fence or tree on the roadside, and then, following still the pressed and jerked bit, slewing around and proceeding back in the direction from whence he came, it will easily be understood that he made but little progress, and that his one and a half miles were more difficult to get over than he had had any idea of when starting. Tarleton spared neither roughness of language nor of manner to persuade his captive to cease her screams and abandon her struggles. But Amy closed her ears to his threats, and renewed with greater intensity than ever her cries for halp and her efforts to free herself from the grasp of her abductor. Tarleton had proceeded about three hundred yards, when he heard, grow- ing more and more distinct each moment, the hurried tramp of an advancing horseman, It was the same which had greeted his ear at the commencement of his journey, but which the excitement of the moment and the agony of his arm had caused him to forget. Could it be a friend? He had no reason to hope so. If an enemy-with this thought, a sense of the reality of his danger burst upon him. If in a position to defend himself-that is to say, if his wound had not rendered his sword arm useless-lie would have cared little for a dozen foes; he would have fought his way through them all, with a light heart and a careless laugh. But now, incapable of wielding a blade, his captive struggling every moment to free herself, and thereby pre- venting him from guiding and trusting to the fleetness of his horse to save him, he felt that resistance would be worse than idle.   OF MARION AND nIls MERRY MEN.        153 Meanwhile, the unknown horseman approached nearer and more near. A moment, and he would be in sight, from which only a bend' in the road preserved him. Meanwhile, Amy's piercing cries for help startled both horse and rider, maddening the first, and arousing all the black blood of the second. "Curse you!" hissed Tarleton, through his set-teeth. "Be silent, or rn violate you here on the open road! Be silent, I say!" Amy heeded him not. She, too, had heard the quick tread of the ad- vancing horseman, and hope uprose before her. At length the bend was passed, and in the clear moonlight Tarleton be- held, some twenty yards ahead, what appeared to his disturbed fancy, a gi- gantic spectre, mounted on a large. coal-black steed of matchless symmetry, and approaching him in a straight line with incredible swiftness. The horseman, standing in his stirrups, held in his right hand along, naked blade, and, so straight, firm and motionless was his bearing, appeared more like an avenging spirit, than a thing of flesh and blood. 'His horse, too, was worthy of its strange rider. With the exception of the pattering of its hoofs, there was nothing to stamp it of earthly origin. It ap- proached with the speed of lightning, and the silence of death. It did not apppear to breathe, and there Was none 6f that energetic movement of the muscles, which marks each spring of a genuine courser. For a few moments, Tarleton, naturally superstitious, was seized with a feeling of terror. Thanks to the bend in tie road, he did not perceive the mysterious horseman in time to wheel and flee, or to avoid the collision which his captive's struggling movements and their corresponding pressure upon his arm and bridle, now rendered inevitable. In his terror, his courage and presence of mind vanished. o19 beheld the spectral horseman approach closer and more close; as the latter drew near, he fancied he could detect the sulphurous odor which is said to accompany visitants from the shadowy world. He h closed his eyes to shut out the frightful vision, and imagniing his death hour had come, yielded himself up for lost At this instant, the horseman glided by, and perceiving no show of resist- ance, changed his sword from his right to his left hand, stretched out his disengaged arm, transferred the fair captive from the colonel's saddle to his own, whispered a word into her ear, which recalled her affrighted senses, caused her to utter a cry of joy and to throw her arms in rapturous emotion around the neck of her deliverer, and then passed on in his flying course witl apparently the same statue-like imperturbability which had marked his ap- proach. When Tarleton re-opened his eyes, he was solemnly impressed with the conviction that he had seen an inhabitant of the spirit world. He lived in an age when superstition counted its votaries by millions, wlhen spectral ap- pearances were supposed to be n't infrequent, and when all classes, from the  ermined monarch down to the rough clad peasant, were more 'or less in- fluenced by an usnshaken belief in visitants from the plantom world. "It is a warningl" he muttered, moodily. "Tihe presence of an appari- tion is at all times the precursor of calamity. Something fearlhl is about to happen. Why did I engage in this rash adventure? Fool, dolt, idiot that I am, I am always rushing into follies, that bring with themn' for me and mine, a terrible ending But they will shortly have an end-else whly the appear- ance of this spectre. Hlark!" He raised himself in his stirrup, strained his eyes in tih direction of lKings- tree, and listened. A low, confused din, rising gradually into a roar, fell ol his ear. He was too familiar with such sounds to mistake them. "Did I not say so?" he muttered, smiting his forehead lacsoiorat ly. "Did 20     154   -    THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS I not say so A surprise, and I absent I am ruined. Lo! my calamity is begun!" Plunging his spurs into his charger's flanks, he dashed, forward, foaming with passionate self-reproach. He had proceeded about a quarter of a mile, when he discovered two horsemen rapidly approaching him. By the peculiarity of their costume, he recognized them as friends. Well?" he demanded, as they came within hearing. "Colonel," said the foremost, "f have been despatched in search of you. We are beset, and a large number of our nen are cut to pieces, and-" "Silence!" thundered Tarleton, foaming with passion. "Who is in com- mand?" ' Lieutenant Davidson." "Back, and tell him I am coming. Who is that with you?" "Adjutant Benedict." "Enough. Let him accompany me. As for you, back and tell Lieutenant Davidson I will be with him in five minutes after your arrival. , Begone!" "I will so report, sir!" replied the young officer, wheeling his horse and returning in the direction whence he came. "Adjutant Benedict," said Tarleton, as the other approached, "ride down the road till you come to the next house. You will there find three of your superior officers engaged in a combat. Call them off in my name, and bid them hurry to the rescue. Despatch, sir 1" He waived his hand, and then resumed his route. The young adjutant, marvelling at the colonel's desertion of his men under such circumstances, hurried off to obey his order. But he scarcely proceeded a hundred yards, when, at a bend in the road, he suddenly found himself face to face with two armed horsemen. "Loyalists or rebels?" he demanded as he unsheathed his weapon, in no wise daunted by the odds against him. "Rebels to the king, loyalists to the American Congress " shouted the foremost rider in a tone that made the officer start "Hal I know that voice," he exclaimed, somewhat disturbed; "but I was not aware before that it belonged to a rebel. As for me, I am a servant of the king. Come on!" "Thank you!" returned the other. "I accept your invitation. Stand back, Fred. One against one is quite enough 1" "Vewy good," returned his companion quietly. Sprague-the reader has already guessed it-pressed encrgetically upon the young officer, and after a few passes disarmed him. "You are my prisoner!" he exclaimed. "Come, sir-turn your horse's head. There is not a moment to lose. Fall in, Fred. We are wanted at Kingstree."             * The adjutant, confused, at the suddenness, and humiliated at the result ot the incident, complied with this order, uttering at the same time a deep sigh In another moment, the trio were moving 'at a brisk pace toward the vil- lage "You look dejected, sir," observed Sprague, kindly. "But cheer up- your position is only one of the chances of war ' "I am nob thinking of myself," returned the adjutant, "but of the effect my capture may have upon those whom I was ordered to look up." "If you allude to the three accomplices whom Colonel Tarleton left be- hind him, I can ease your mind at once. They have met the fate their crime provoked." "Their crime, sir?" returned the adjutant, drawing himself up. "Yes, their crime I Is it too harsh a term to apply to men who voluntal W                     '       F MAON AND H    ME    IEN.       155 I -   OF reTMAPION AND HS MERRY MEN.       15t6 rily engage in the forcible abduction of a young lady, to gratify the lust of a heartless libertine?" I "Pardon me," said the adjutant. ' I was not aware of that. This, then, was Colonel Tarleton's errand down here to-night?" "That, and no other, as I am a christian!" answered Sprague. "Then shame upon him!", exclaimed the young officer, indignantly. "Oh, I shall never be able to treat him with the respect due to my commander, again! I blush for him-I blush for our army, which has such men for its leaders-I blush at myself, for my connexion with such a man for my supe- rior. It is humiliating I ,And his accomplices, you say-" "Are now in the presence of their God!" said Sprague, solemnly. The adjutant shuddered. "Their names?" he asked. "Bascomb, Lester and Griswold." "What! the best officers of our regiment! Oh, Tarleton-Tarleton I what excuse can you offer for the ignoble end to which your brutal lust has consigned these brave men. Shame upon you-shame upon you!" "You are an honest man, sir!" said Sprague, warmly, " and as such I now restore you to liberty. Take back your sword, sir!" The officer received it with a low bow, and in a voice agitated with emo- tion, returned his thanks. They were now within a short distance of the village which was in a stormy commotion. "Here let us part, sir!" said Sprague, extending his hand to the adjutant. ' You have a better heart than I supposed to be in the British army. It would give me great pleasure to see you engaged in a nobler service." "Do not," he said, with a quivering lip, " wound me with an insult which gratitude forbids me to resent I am an Englishman, and regard the king's service as the highest on earth." "I respect your opinion, sir, and bow to the justness of your reproof," re- turned Sprague, tranquilly. "Shake hands, sir. "Adieu ' And they parted. They were soon at the head of the road.' They paused for a few moments to survey the scene before them. Riot, terror, uproar and confusion reigned throughout the village. Squads of half-dressed soldiery, some with and many without arms, were flying in every direction; some making for the green, some for the dwellings and fences, and others for the roads and fields. Scattered over the ground, solitarily and in heaps, lay scores shrieking with agonizing wounds, or stark and pale in death. The air, thick with smoke, rang with the roar of musketry and the din of ,steel. Here was a brawny woodsman coolly aiming at a flying trooper; there another, with clubbed weapon, braining one after another three or fbur panic stricken wretches who were flying confusedly before him. At another point might be seen three or four horsemen pursuing, with raised blades, half a score or more, and sternly cleaving to the shoulder all with whom they came in contact; at another, thirty or forty riflemen pouring ia a deadly fire upon a body of troops flying pell mell before them; at still an- pther, a hundred or more of fierce-browed rangers, led on by the tall, stal- wart form of our old friend the scalp hunter, charging with resistless impetu- osity a scattered mass of troops who vainly strove to hold their ground against their fierce assailants; while upon the green could be discerned, de- spite the smoke of conflict, the small, slender but wiry form of Marion mounted on a bold, powerful roan, and directing the fierce onsets and sweep- ing charges of two hundred iron willed riflemen against a force double his own, commanded by the dashing and impetuous Tarleton. l     s ^5 6   sTtHE SWAMP STEED; OR  IfE DAYS While Sprague and the exquisite were thus taking a hurried survey of the exciting scene before them, they were suddedly startled by a loud voice with the inquiry: "Gentlemen, America needs the help of all her friends to-night! Are ye for her with your swords, as with your hearts?" It was the voice of Somers. "Lead on, sir!" responded Sprague. "Lead on, sir-I am weady!" answered the exquisite. "Ho, there, hold up!" shouted the planter,.in a clear, ringing tone, to a body of rangers in pursuit of a panic stricken party of troops flying towards the town house; " ye are wanted on the green. Follow me!" And setting himself at their head, he rushed forward with a loud shout, gallantly followed by his men. By this time the scalp hunter had succeeded in scattering the troops with whom he had been engaged, and calling off his rangers from the pursuit, he reformed them, and marched forward to the relief of Marion. The latter was already on the point of victory, and this reinforcement, coupled with that of the planter, quickly decided it. Tarleton, unable longer to hold out, gave the order for retreat, and in a few minutes the royal troops were flying with all speed from the villeg:e, and by the same road by which they had entered it but three days before. The surprise was triumphant and complete. Calling off his men from the pursuit, gathering together the prisoners, arms, ammunition and stores which iad fallen into his hands, Marion encamped on the green for the remainder of the night;. and at day break of the following morning quietly returned to his head-quarters at Snow's Island, as much for the purpose of security as to indulge his exhausted followers in a day or two of tranquil repose. CHAPTER XX. SNow's ISLAND, better known by its traditionary name of the camp of Marion, lay at the confluence of Lynch's Creek and the Pedee /River. Though of no great magnitude, Snow's Island was yet spacious, rotnantic, pictur- esque and imposing. It was surrounded by a deep swamp, leading to a vast and almost impenetrable cane brake, through which an army would find it extremely difficult and dangerous to pass. Beyond the canes, on the rising grounds, loomed up a thick forest of massive pines, towering cypress and stately laure!, whose contiguous trunks and interlacing limbs formed a con- tinuous natural belt, guarding the approaches to the interior of the island like an immense wall, Here and there the forest border was broken by deep gullies and dark ravines, whose jagged sides were covered by thick mosses and creeping briars, and in the shadows of whose broken and cavernous ledges lay sleepless sentinels, the long, black tubes of whose unerring rifles might be seen peeping through the clambering vines. tn the tops of the skirting trees, and concealed amid the branches, look- outs were stationed to give warning of the approach of friend or enemy. Breaking through the wood and underbrush, for a distance of about a hundred yards, you fall suddenly into a large, level plain, marked here and there with small patches of Indian corn, beds of sweet potatoes, and now antl then a solitary and majestic cypress. Guarding it on all sides, rise one above the other, continuous lines of towering timber, giving to the long, broad plain, the aspect of a vast natural amphitheatre. Scattered here and there are rude tents, formed of saplings and beechen bark. Lying at the foot of a shady tree behold a ragged, bare foot, gaunt,   OF MARION AND HS MERRlY MEN.         1;7 but active and vigorous borderer, his hand upon the barrel of his rifle even in his moments of slumber. A short distance from this tired and worn-out sleeper are a group of six or eight, ragged and gaunt as himself, seated around a ground fire, roasting corn and potatoes, their only food, and talking over their latest adventures. Not far off from these, behold some forty or fifty men, in the rough, uncouth garb of borderers, ploughmen and woodsmen in- dulging in rude sports and trials of muscle, suppleness and. speed. Afar ofiW we find old warriors drilling and exercising squads of new recruits. Others are hoeing the corn and potato patches with assiduous care. Rifles ar lean- ing against the straggling trees, sabres and rapiers depending fromr their boughs. Here and there is a rough, powerful woodsman cleaning the locd, and otherwise overhauling his trusty weapon and preparing it for future use. Steeds are browsing in the shade, their bits loosened, and the saddle still on their backs, ready to be strapped at a moment's warning, and to start at the first shrill peal of the bugle. Through the openings of the rude tents may be seen here a borderer sewing up the. rent made in the last sortie, there a rag- ged, half naked ploughman rivetting the crazy handle of his hacked sabre, and joking with another who is vainly laboring to peg up the upgers of his worn-out shoes which let in daylight as well as water on his toes. At the foot of a tree, wrapped up in his blanket, wo see a poor, miserable, squalid, half famished wretch, striving to forget his country's sufferings and his own in the lethe of repose.  This was the camp of Marion. About three weeks after the incidents related in the preceding chapter, three persons were seated before a small oblong table in the beechen tent ot Marion, which had nothing to distinguish it from those around, except a rag ged flag floating above its top. The parties in the tent, were General Marion, Somers, and Nat, the scalp hunter. "I have sent for you, gentlemen," began the general, throwing his deep, thoughtful eyes upon his auditors with an impressive air, "to lay before you a few important facts, and to get your views upon them." The planter and scalp hunter bowed. "That you may better understand, gentlemen, what I am about to ask your counsel upon, I will first state my position. I am, as you are aware, a mere partisan, battling with such humble energies as I can call into action, for the benefit of my poor, bleeding country. I am in the field, not for fame, nor yet for money, but for the cause of humanity. Nominally in the service of Congress, in reality I am in my own. Not a man in my reginent, looks for any other reward for his services, except that which arises from the con- sciousness of having performed his duty in his efforts to emancipate his country from the unscrupulous rule of a brutal and unscrupulous tyrant. I am more in the service of Carolina than in that of Congress; and I prefer the service of our province, as it leaves me at perfect liberty to choose my own men, my own mode of fighting, and my owin battle grounds. Still, as the success of Congress is our success, as its failure is also oulr failure, I owe a certain allegiance to Congress, which, as an American soldier battling for America, Hcannot shake off, and would not if I could." He paused, bowed his pale brow for a moment or two upon his hands, and then resumed.      ' '"The struggle between the colouies aud the rmother country, has boen a long and trying ones and there is every prospect of its continuance till one of wo things shall happen-the destruction of the small army of Congress, or that of the greater one of the king. The chances lare unquestionably with the royal party, which outnumbers ours five to one; and which instead of decreasing, notwithstanding its numerous defeats, is continually being strengthened and invigorated by tories from our own shores, and by fresh I{ I     158       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS accessions from abroad. Ours, on the contrary, grows smaller and smaller day by day, partly through desertion, partly through battle, but more through want of arms, ammunition, clothing, provisions and money, which the enemy has in abundance." "We must snake 'em from him, gineral!" answered the scalp hunter, im- patiently. Marion smiled. "We'll come to that by and bye," he said, quietly. "To prevent, then, the cause, in which we all have an abiding interest, from falling to the ground, we nmst give it a fresh interest by fresh victories, and these victo- ries must be decisive; to save our small army in the South from being cut up and destroyed in detail, our scattered forces nmust be united, and our bat- tles, triumphs; to re-invigorate the hopes and hearts of our troops, who are now sunl in mental despondency because their feet are without shoes, their stomachs scarcely ever filled, and their bodies clad in rags, we must feed and clothe them, so their hopes and hearts and their wandering, wavering con- fidence, may come back to them. Then, and not till then, will the cloud that so long has hovered over us, pass away." The planter bowed his head thoughtfully in the palms of his raised hands. The scalp hunter, unconsciously to himself, began to play with the horned handle of his long knife, and to examine, with a critical eye and fee, theedge and temper of its blade. Marion observed them. both, quietly. "My own men," he continued, "are very, very poor I They fight neither for money nor fame-but for their country. They are keen, brave, patient, tried and enduring men. Privation and suffering they heed not; danger, affliction, death, touches them not, so long as hope clings to THE CAUSE. They are able and willing to go on, but they are poor. They cannot be always with me, they cannot be always in the field; their farms, or rather I should say their families, require them during the planting and harvesting seasons of the year. It was but yesterday, as you know, when fifty of our best ran- gers were compelled to leave us for a time, to attend to the wants of their families; and thirty more obtained leave for the same purpose to-day. They are poor, their wives and children suffering for food and raiment, and they had to go and provide for them; to earn bread and garments for them as' well as for themselves; and forty others, our best, bravest and trustiest men, desire to start to-morrow. Their families need them-their families that are suffering, famishing, dying with want!" Tears were trickling through the planter's fingers, though all unknown to' him. The scalp hunter's eyes were moist, and his coarse, rough hands trembled as they toyed with the long, sharp knife. "These men, at least the most of them," continued Marion, "will all come- back when they have made a temporary provision for thier families and them selves-their poverty will not permit them to return before. Meanwhile, through their absence, what chances to drive the British squadrons from our province, will be lost, what opportunities for cutting off provisions, arms and ammunition from reaching the foe, will have to pass unheeded; what de, feats will the few who remain with us have to endure, for want of sufficient companions to convert them into triumphs? My heart, gentlemen-mJ heart bleeds to think of it!" "You have not told us all, general?" said the planter, looking up; his eyes; red with weeping, his cheeks pale with anguish. "No," said Marion, with an air of deep agony, "I have not told you all The worst is yet to come. Listen. As we have gone on for years, as we are going on now, so we will go on for years to come, unless something de- cisive be done to relieve the sufferings of our men, and to preserve therm   OF MARION AND HS!

General Green requests me to form ajunction with him and Sump- ter, so that our united forces may this year drive the British from Carolina and the South. But what junction can I form with him, even for so essen- tial and important a step, when my rangers are scattered-the plough in their hand instead of the rifle! And yet, as you see, gentlemen, something like, this must be done, or our struggles in the past and in the present, as well as those which are to come, will be for naught. And yet again, gentlemen," he added, in a voice which trembled with emotion, " to do this, to prepare for this, we must have-money!" "You have a plan?" said the planter, inquiringly. "Ef yew hev, gineral," added the scalp hunter, in a tone of deep feeling1 put us on the trail, an' we'll run down the varmint quicker 'n chain lightnin'!"  "I have a plan," returned Marion, slowly, "but it is attended with the deepest danger." "We ain't of the skeery breed, gineral!" observed the scalp hunter. "An' ef it's in keepi4 with your idee to let us inter it, the camp wun't long be without a full compliment of rangers." "I was sure of your co-operation in my design, gentlemen," returned Ma- rion, "or I had not asked you to this conference. To prove the unlimited confidence I repose in you, I despatched a note to General Gccen ten min- utes after I received his letter, informing him of my acceptance of his pro- posal to unite our forces, and pledging myself to bring with me every man of my brigade." "That was doin' the handsum thing, gineral!" observed the scalp hunter, with an animated smile. "It was trusting your honor in our humble hands!" exclaimed the planter, with emotion. "AhI gentlemen," returned Marion with an air of confidence which was wholly sublime, " have you not had it, together with my life, in your pos- session, from the first hour of our struggle? And should I meanly with- draw it from you now?" The planter and his comrade burst into tears. "Command us "' they cried, simultaneously. "Gentlemen," said Marion, in a broken voice, "I will confess that this new evidence of your heroic devotion, does not surprise me. Knowing the purity of your patriotism, the unfaltering character of your courage, the fer- vency of your friendship, your elevating sense of honor, I looked for it, and thought myself prepared for it. But yet, now that it is here, now that it is no longer an anticipation but a reality, I must acknowledge, and I do it free- ly, that it makes me tremble, that it shakes my soul. For it is danger great danger, to which I am about to expose it. It may be that death-do you hear me, my friends-death?-shall be the reward of it-death!" "Ef it be fifty," cried the scalp hunter, "let 'em cum! I'm in the cause to the last hair in my scalp. An' ef I cave in, the red coat varmint will smell pisin afore I drop " "As for rme, General," said the planter, with an air of solemn grandeur, "I have already consecrated my arm, my sword, my energies, my ife if it nted be, to my country. I am ready to redeem my pledge!" "Gentlemen," said Marion, with a' trembling lip, "I will no longer keep from you the secret mission which our suffering country calls upon you to take up. Listen, gentlemen." "We listen." "Gentlemen, the city of Charleston is in the hands of the enemy-that enemy who shows no mercy to rebels, who has for every American that falls into his hands nothing but a bullet or a cord!"     160       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "We care not for the bullet," said the planter, firmly, for himself and his companion, " we care not for the cord 1" "Gentlemen, in Charleston, there are spies at every hand, to watch and give up every rebel who dares to show himself within the city's ward." "We care not for the spies-we will baffle them!" "Within the city's ward are framed the plans for the subjugation of Caroli- nia and the south. It is necessary that you go to Charleston, incur the risk of detection and of death, learnsthe strength of the British force as well as their designs, and transmit it on to me, that I may again despatch it to Gen- eral Green, who will take his measures accordingly." "We will go to Charleston 1" Gentlemen, it is at Charleston where lie the resources which we so much need, and which enable the enemy to continue this harrassing and ruinous war." "You shall have a portion of those resources, general, I promise it!" "And I, gineral," said the scalp hunter, "I gurantee that the British wunt do much with what's left. The varmint hev had 'em long enuff-a cussed sight longer than they'll ever hev 'em agin l" "Gentlemen," said Marion, with emotion, "I accept your promise. And now, remember two things, all important-secresy and despatch!" "We shall not forget." "The destiny of our country hangs, perhaps, in your hands-remember that. Go now, my fiiends, my companions! and make ready for your jour- ney!" "A word, general," said the planter. "Speak, my friend."  "I received to-day a letter from my tender parent She is nervous and unhappy. Her loneliness is killing her." "In view of which," said Marion, sympathizingly, "you have a favor to ask?" "Yes, general" "Name it, my friend." "The privilege of. conveying her where she will be lonely no longer, and of leaving her with those who will console her for my absence." l 'Tis granted, sir," returned Marion; "for well I know you will not let it interfere unnecessarily with the important mission in your hands." "Be assured of that, general!" "I am assured of it. And now, gentlemen, adieu 1 The God of freedom and humanity watch over and protect you " CHAPTER XXI. "Tr us now, reader, step across the country, ascend one of the high, forest crowned hills on the margin of the Santee, and look in upon the small plan- tation of the twin brothers. It was at the c se Jf a fine summer's day; the twins, having finished their day's labor, and partaken'of their evening meal, were resting tranquilly from their toil, inhaling the cool, reviving air, and conversing with Jheir friendly purveyor, instructor and companion, Ned Mowizon, to whom they nad long since become most tenderly attached. A pleasing change was visible in their appearance. Though not much taller than when we last beheld tlhem, they had yet a more manly air; they were broader in the shoulder, and deeper in the chest; and though still some- what slender in figure, there was an aspect of suppleness and muscle in their o     *   OF MARION AND HS iMERRY MEN,         161 wiry frames which would make even a burly borderer pause and reflect ere he decided to measure strength with them. Their former freshness of conm plexion had given place to a fine, healthy bronze. Their large, blue eyes were clear, steady and bold as an eagle's. Their general appearance was that of brave, vigorous, healthy, modest, clear-headed mountaineers. Like their companion, Ned Mowizon, they were dressed in blue cloth vest and breeches, cut in the quaker fashion of that day, and each was seated upon a rustic chair on the small lawn facing their cosy lodge. "Ned," began Frederick, surveying the field before them, with an air of satisfaction, " the rice looks up as if it appreciated our labors. Our brother will be pleased when he arrives 1" "Unquestionably," answered Ned. "He could not be otherwise. I say it, and I'll stick to it." "You really .think' so, Ned?" asked the twins, eagerly. "I do, boys," returned Mowizon, "and I'll stand to iti And what is more, I'm not the only man of that opinion. When he was here, last-" "He " interrupted the twins reproachfully. "Oh,. Ned!" "Mr. Somers, I mean-he said it was equal to the best on his plantation." "He said thatl" cried Frederick, with an expression of joyous pride. "He paid us that compliment?' inquired George, as if he could scarcely credit his senses. "He did," answered Mowizon, gravely. "And that isn't all, either. He added that it was superior." "Oh, Ned-Ned l" cried the twins, incredulously. "I mean it!" observed Mowizon, with an airof firmness, " and I'll stand to it!!" "You do?" "I dol Every word of it l"' The twins were ready to weep for joy. "Now, boys," pursued Mowizon, gravely, " when a man like him-" "Him 1" interrupted the twins, reproachfully. "Like Neil Somers, I mean-delivers an opinion like that, there must be good grounds for it." "Exactly!" cried Frederick. "Precisely!" observed George. "And for two reasons, boys," continued Mowizon. "In the first place, Mr. Somers never asserts anything that is not unqualifiedly true; and in the second place, I say it, and I'll stand to it, he is the finest planter as well as most accurate judge in such matters, there is in the province." "There can be no doubt of that!" observed Frederick, whl had the most unlimited faith in his brother. "None at alil ' added George, who regarded Neil with an affection bor- dering on idolatry. "Have we not seen his fields?" "That is true, boys," said Mowizon, " but then it was in the night time, - and when, accompanied by your elder brother, you had previously been look- ing upon your tender hearted parent." "Who," observed Frederick; with a sigh, "unconscious we were so near, was, doubtless, dreaming of us." "As we, in our slumbers, never fail to dream of her!" added George, rev- erently. "Exactly," remarked Ned, with an approving nod. "As I was saying, boys, you have seen Neil Somers' fields, but then it was by moonlight only, and after your eyes had first been brought to take a generous view of every thing by the pleasing sight of your dear mother's face. Then, all things would naturally appear fair and lovely. But it is in the day time that you should look upon Neil Somers' rice fields; in the day time," he repeated, impres- sively, " when the light is clear, and no extraneous circumstances interfere to 21     162       THE SWAMP STEED ; OR TMH DAYS warp your judgment, or lend a pair of golden spectacles to your eyes. Then, boys, you would, indeed, be amazed at the universal evidences of care, watchfulness, industry and, I might add, genius bestowed on every foot of his plantation, which, with the exception of our little one up here, hasn't got its equal any where. I say it, and I'll stand to it." - "But, Ned," ventured Frederick, with a sigh, "we shall not be able to have the pleasure of looking on our brother's fields in the daylight for a good long while to come!" "Not till he is satisfied of our thorough reform, as well as of our love of industry," added George. "Exactly," rejoined Ned. "But, between ourselves, boys, I've a notion it won't be so very long a time, either!" "Oh, Ned I are you not playing with us, now?" asked Frederick, with an imploring air. "rDo tell us that, Nedl" added George, drawing his chair, as did his brother, nearer to him.    I "Not a bit," answered Mowizon, gravely. "I am not the man to trifle with my friends. What I say, I stand to, because what I say, I mean." "We have always found you true, Ned :' said Frederick, affectionately. "Always, Ned 1" added George. "Ad you ever will, boys,' said Mowizon, " because you see I've learned to look on you as brothers. We've been together here a long time, working on the same grounds, eating at the same table, reading from the same books, singing the same songs and hymns, and sleeping under the same roof. What wonder then, I should love you like brothers, what wonder I should be true  Boys,' he added, with emotion, "Neil Somers has been a good and noble friend to me and mine, although he is not the man to brag of it. When my poor old parents were burned out of house and home by the Indians, he was the man who stepped forward of his own free will and set 'em on their legs; and when, afterwards, by the failure of their crops, they again fell into dis- tress, he, and he only, gave them the lifting hand which enabled 'ea to wade through misfortune's sea, and come .out with a smile. Is it to be wondered at, then, that I should regard him with feeling of gratitude and respect; or, that I should be true and good to you, who, besides being my pupils, as I may call you, are, at the same time, the blood-born brothers of him who has done so much for me and mine. Boys, I say it, and I'll stand to it, you will always find Ned Mowizon true to you as steel 1" "We believe that, Ned " said Frederick. "Firmly 1" added George. "And you may count on it," said Ned, returning the pressure of their sends. "But, as I was saying, boys, I don't think it will be very, very long, before you are permitted to look on Neil's plantation by the light of day. fn fact, he added, in a lower voice than he had yet used, "I've understood as much." "Tell us all about it, Ned!" cried the twins, in a breath. "You see, boys," said Mowizon, confidentially, "but it is a secret, mind-" "Oh yes." "Neil is now satisfied, and has been for some time, that you have lost all desire for your old, wicked habitsa-" The twins blushed and dropped their eyes upon the ground. "And become pure and honest minded men." The brothers looked up tearfully, gratefully. "He sees, that the good reports I have given of you are borne out by the testimony of our little model plantation, as well as by the simple and high moral tone which marls your letters, conversation and general bearing He sees that your acquired habits of industry sit easily'and gracefully upon you, without the least shadow of restraint. He sees and feels that you have learned x    OF MARION AND .IIS UtERRY MEN.       163 the wisdom of throwing off, through choice, all vicious thoughts and unmanly hankerings; that you are no longer mere idle, pleasure-loving worldlings, but mm--men of pure souls and honest hearts-men, who perceiye first the ne- cessity and then the justice of each individual member of the great family of man, willingly and honestly performing his share of work in his passage through the world. He sees that you have a clear and vivid conception of what man owes first, to himself, secondly, to his fellow-man, and then to his God; he sees that you live up to this, conception, and that, knowing the meanness and beastiality of vice, you prefer the nobler and purer course of virtue; that, having imbibed deeply from the fount of error, you are deter- mined to drink, henceforth, only from the well of truth!" "As He may help us!" said Frederick, reverently lifting up his eyes which were bedewed with tears from a contrite and grateful heart. "As He may sustain us!" added George, trembling with devout joy. As He WILL!" observed Mowizon, solemnly, "as He does all who trust in Him 1" "We repose our faith in Him!" exclaimed Frederick. "We confide in Him!" added George. "And he will desert you never!" returned Mowizon, encouragingly, and looking around as if expecting somebody. "As I was saying, boys, Neil sees that from the test to which you so cheerfully Submitted, you have come out pure and true; that from the lessons which you sat down to learn,'you have risen ripe and healthy scholars: and that from mere worthless world- lings you have become upright and useful men." ' Oh, ed," cried Frederick, in a trembling voice, "is this true that you are telling us?" "Tell us, Ned," added George, "shall we at length have the heavenly pri- vilege of receiving our brother's confidence, of walking, conversing anrd liv- ing with him familiarly, constantly; and of being re-united to the love, bless- ing and elevating companionship of our pure and tender mother?" Shall we again, Ned," demanded Frederick, "take our seats together at the family table, kneel together at thE family altar, sit together around the family hearth, and sleep once more like a happy family under the roof of the old homestead?"' "Receive," asked George, " our brother's unchanging friendship, our moth- er's constant smile?" "Oh!" cried Frederick, trembling, " that would be more than an Eden, it would be heaven!" "Is it this, Ned," asked George, in a voige broken with emotion, and with a mingled look of fear and hope, " that you are promising us?" '"Boys," returned Mowizon, slowly, "it is this which I promise you, but not on the instant." "Oh, no 1" exclaimed Frederick, with a burst of gratitude, " not on thein- stant, for the suddenness of so great a joy would kill us. But soon?" "Yes, it will be soon, Ned, will itnot?" asked George. "Yes, boys-soon!" added Mowizon, again looking around, and answer- ing with a movement of his finger a sign made to him by some party or par- tiees in the wood. "Oh!" cried the twins, throwing themselves upon his neck, " bless you, Ned-bless you!" F   "And Him?" said Mowizon, pointing upward, in a tone of mingled re- proof and reverence. "Ah I yes" they exclaimed, "you are right. 'Tis to Him we should re- turn thanks for this unmerited happiness. To Him 1" There was a silence of some moments. "As I was saying, boys," resumed Mowizon, at length, "Neil is satisfied that the change which has come over your- minds is both pure and perma-     164       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS nent, and now deems you fit, morally and mentally, to enter the hallowed presence of your mother." "Oh! happiness-happiness!" " "For this hour," continued MAowizon, raising his voice to a slightly higher key, and making, unnoticed by the twins, a sign to the parties he had de- tected in the wood, "for this hour, he has prayed long and fervently; for this houlr -" "For this hour," repeated a ripe, rich, pleasant voice which caused the twins to spring from their seats with a cry of exultant joy, " that he might say, Come to my heart, my brothers! For this hour," added the planter, for it was he, as the twins thrdw, themselves upon his breast, " that I might say, Ye have not longer yearned for this moment than I." "Oh, my brother-my brother!" exclaimed the twins, pressing him with indescribable delight in their arms. "For this hour," continued the planter, waving his hand, unseen by the twins, at which sign the tall, manly figure of the scalp hunter emerged from the wood into the lawn, accompanied by a lady, whose small, slender form was attired in a dress of Quaker like make, neatness and simplicity, and whose trembling steps bespoke her mental and physical agitation, "for this h our, that I might say, Brothers behold your mother, For this hour, that I might say, Mother, thy lost ones have returned, pure as when they left thee, for thy blessing!" "My Frederick-my Georgel my children 1" sobbed Mrs. Somers, open- ing her arms. "Mother! Oh, heaven I mother-receive us, bless us!" gasped the twins, throwing themselves at her feet. "For this hour," continued the planter, extending one hand over those he so fervently loved, and lifting the other reverently to heaven, "that I might say, Lo we are again united-our hearth stone that was broken, is whole agai--our joy that was imperfect, is complete-thanks, thanks to THEE 1" CHAPTER XXII Two days subsequent to the events narrated in the preceding chapter, co- lonel Balfour, the comnmandant of the city of Charleston, was seated in the drawing room of his head-quarters, perusing a despatch from Lord Rawdon, then in command of the British forces in South Carolina. Before him, on a large circular table, lay 1 number of maps, papers, letters, and the necessary appliances for epistolary correspondence. Colonel Balfour, was a tall, portly personage, with bold Saxon features, of a lordly aristocrat cast, and was dressed in the uniform of his office. He was interrupted in the perusal of the despatch by the entrance of an aid-de-camp, who appeared to have something to commuhicate. "What is it, Hudson?" said the commandant, familiarly. "There is a gentleman without," replied the aid-de-camp, "who desires an interview." "Who is he?" "A Air. Brofield, from Kingstree." "His business?" "He did not inform me of that, colonal; but judging from his manner, I should say it was of importance."           ' Colonel Balfour reflected a moment, and then observed- "Admit him." The aid-de-camp bowed and retired, and in a few momenta the stramgr   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.      .   16 made his appearance, anp saluted the commandant with an air which satisfied the latter that his visitor was of a superior order in the ranks of social intel- ligence. The stranger was dressed in a tight fitting body coat of blue cloth, lined with pale silk; a white vest, buff breeches, silk hose, and pumps with silver buckles. In his right hand, he held a black chapeau, which he had taken from his head as he crossed the threshold of the apartment. ".Mr. Brofield, I presume?" said the commandant, waving him courteously to a chair. "l To what, sir, do I owe the honor of this visit?" he continued, as the stranger seated himself. "My object in calling upon you, sir," said the stranger, with an air of ease and graceful dignity which struck colonel Balfour with surprise and ad- miration, "is to obtain from you, if possible, the necessary means to enable me to check the movements of the rebels in the neighborhood in which I reside." "Oblige' me with an explanation, Mr. Brofield?" said the commandant, strongly impressed by the noble bearing of his visitor. "Certainly, sir," returned the straner. "It cannot but be known to you, colonel Balfour, that the operations of the rebels in the interior a de directed with great fierceness against the friends of His Majesty?" "I am aware of that, Mr. Brofield." "Of late," continued the stranger, ".they have been unusually troublesome and particularly so in the section in which I reside. Our dwellings have been fired, our fields destroyed, our people butchered. Day after day witncsses some new calamity, some fiesh outrage, equally as appalling, if not more frightful, than any which preceded it. And what renders our position the more aggravating is that, notwithstanding the heavy and almost oppressive assessments to which we are subjected by the crown, we are yet left to the rapacity of these rebels, who, aware of our utter defencelessness, fall upon us without fear, and without mercy."  . "And you endure this tamely?" said Colonel Balfour, in a mingled tone of symipathy and reproach. "We endure it," returned the stranger, with an air of tranquil grandeur, "because the kiig, by leaving us without protection, bids us submit to it l" "This is a superior personage!" murmured the commandant to himself. "But we would not put up with it, not passively at least," added the stranger, "if the crown, by giving us the means of defence, should bid us re- taliate upon the mauraders. Then, for every blow inflicted upon us, we should return two; for every step they made upon our borders, they would pay the price with a life."       ' This was said with a native modesty and earnestness which left no doubt of the stranger's meaning or sincerity. "It is to obtain at your hands the means and permission to punish these rebels," resumed the stranger, "that I am here, at the desirp of my friends." "The permission, I can easily grant you, Mr. Brofield," said the com- mandant; " but I must confess that the means are not so freely at my dis- posal. Our troops are not so numerous as I could wish, and the operations of Lord Rawdon in the northern part of the province, by his continual drafts upon me for men, are daily still further reducing the number in my hands. It was but yesterday I sent him four hundred troops, and to-day I received another despatch ordering an additional three hundred. You see, therefore. Mr. Brofield, that my hands are tied in this matter, and that, however much disposed I might be to preserve you from the aggressions of the rebels, the ability to do so is not in my keeping," r Will you pardon me, colonel," said the stranger, with an air of impressive Uknity; "but I fear I did not express myself with sufficient clearness."     166       TH: sWA rr STEIED; OR THE DAYS "Well, sir?" returned the commandant, courteously. "( It was not men for which I intended to ask you, colonel, but arms, am- * munition and clothing, with which to equip a legion out of our own dis- trict." "Ah! indeed?" returned the commandant. "That alters the case, maa- terially. How large a force could you bring into the field?" he added, after a brief pause. "We have obtained the signatures of five hundred trusty men," returned the stranger. The commandant's eyes sparkled. "That is a goodly number," he observed, thoughtfully. " h short  notice could they be collected?" "Twenty-four hours." The commandant reflected. At length, "Say I could furnish you with the means to equip that number of men," he asked, " what would be the result?" "This,"answered the stranger, calmly. "You would have one great en- emy the less to disturb your plans-one partisan the less to hang on your footsteps and annoy you." "You speak very confidently, Mr. Brodfield!" returned the commandant with a smile. "Why, sir, there are but two men of that importance in the whole province!" "Nevertheless," returned the stranger, "I repeat it. You will have one great enemy the less." "Are you aware of the two of wtom I speak?" asked the commandant, in surprise. "I think I could name them, coloneL" "Reflect, Mr. Brofield," said the commandant. "The individuals to whom I allude are not ordinary men."  "I do not refer to ordinary men, colonel," returned the stranger, tranu uilly. "The persons to whom I refer," continued the commandant, "are nmen of power, of talent, nay of genius." 'Tis oP such men I am thinking, colonel." "Then, sir," said the commandant, shifting nervously in his chair' "name the parties, and thus prove to me that you have not unduly estimated their importance?"  "Sumpter and Marion," was the reply. The features of the commandant sparkled with joy. "And which of these partisans," he said, half springing from his seat, " will you, with your legion, answer for?" "The latter." "Marion?" "Marion." "You will answer for his capture?" "I will answer," said the stranger, " that he shall no longer hang on the footsteps of your army-that he shall no more cut off your reinforcements " "That is not enough, sir!" "Then I will promise," added the stranger, " to have him in Charleston in less than a year." t' A year is a long time, Mr. Brofield!" "In which to take a common enemy, yes-but not a wily one like Ma- rion. It is now more than six years since he threw down the gauntlet of defiance to the whole force of the British orown, and he is still untaken!" "True!" returned the commandant. "I see, sir, that you fully compre- heod the character cf the rebel waom you propose to take in hand." "He has, himself furnished us with the means of comprehending it," ob-   OF MARfON AND HS MERRY MEN.        167 served the stranger. "Has he not been before, around and upon ue ever since the opening of this war? driven us from point to point, cut off our people and our resources, deprived us of our arms, taken from us every means of defence, and then compelled us to remain passive while he swept off' our pro- visions? AhI have we not cause to understand him? And now, if you will furnish us with arms, ammunition and clothing, shall we not hunt him as he has hunted us? Shall we not make him rue the hour when he took tlp arms against men whose principle was loyalty, and whose desire was peace? Shall we. give him an hour of rest who has so long disturbed the serenity of our repose? Shall we spare him who never displayed mercy to us? Shall we give over our pursuit, once we have begun it, till le is in the toils, and his band crushed-every one,? No-let him look to it-the game he plays draws towards it close; the hunters are upon his track, and will not pause till they have run him down!" This was uttered in the calm, deep, earnest voice of a long patient, but at length aroused and sternly determined man. "Enough, Mr. Brofield," said the commandant, who had been attentively regarding him, "you shall have the appliances necessary to enable you to carry this plan into execution." "Accept my most fervent acknowledgments, colonel!" exclaimed the stranger, with the first expression of pleasure he had yet evinced. "And when?" "This hour, if you say so. What arms do you prefer?"' "Those which will place us on a level with our enemy-rifles." "We have but a scant supply of them-nevertheless, your Jplan is impor- tant: you shall have them." The stranger's eyes sparkled as he bowed his thanks. "Of ammunition, we have plenty," continued the commandant, peaning a memorandum of the articles under consideration; "so there will be no trouble in that quarter. How are your friends off for shoes?" "Poorly." "We'll throw in a pair for each man, then. We have an ample supply, Clothin7, blakets, ad such,. mattwrjs w-iD, you Day, atBi be required?" Yes, colonel?" "To convey these things, you will require six baggage wagons, with two stout horses to each. I can furnish you the teams, but not the men. As I said before, I have not a soldier to spare, scarcely enough to protect the city." "I have a friend with me," said the stranger. "He has a keen eye, a stout heart, and a brave hand. He carries a rifle, and understands the use of it!" "But, with all that," observed the commandant with a smile, "he will not be able to protect six waggons!"  "He is equal to ten ordinary men," returned the stranger, with a calm confidence which struck the colonel with admiration and surprise, " and will securely protect the rear." "But the front?" "As for the front," returned the strange:, swim a modest, yet manly dig- nity, "I shall be there." "True!" observed the commandant, surveying with an admiration Whiich he could not wholly repress the man who scarcely appeared to comprehend t the meaning of/the word danger. ' But there is one thing which you appear to forget in connection with this your commendable design." n A Ah colonel?" returned the stranger, with an inquiring glance. Reflect " said the colonel, with a smile.  "On what, colonel?" as'ed the stranger, tranquilly. "Reflect," repeated the commandant, " on the leading essential to carry     168        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS on the operations of a war-wanting which, men, axms, ammunition and clothing are as nought!"

But it is because I had not the courage, having asked and obtained so much of you already!" "Mr. Brofield," said the commandant, rising and advancing towards him, with an air of surprise and unmixed pleasure, 'your hand You are a gen- tleman, sir, and one whom I feel honored in takingto my acquaintance i The stranger blushed. "You overrate an humble country planter, I'm afraid, colonel!" he said, modestly. "Not in the least, Mr. Brofield-not in the least 1" returned the command- ant, shaking him warmly by the hand. "As for themoneyyou equire, sir," he added, resuming his seat, " the king's exchequer is ever open. to his friends  and although it is not over-heaped at present--. " "My dear colonel," interrupted the stranger, "I cannot permit the king's chest to suffer, persuaded as I am that it is the princely generosity of his almoner, and not His Majesty's strong box, which would in reality be the loser." "Not altogether, Mr. Brofield," replied the commandant. "lBut since you have discovered it, I will confess it was my intention, knowing his ma- jesty's treasury to be rather weak, to have made up out of my own purse, the major part of the sum necessary for your design." "Arnd to that colonel," said the stranger, "I most assuredly would not consent." W' Why not, Mr. Brofield?" asked the commandant, in surprise. "Because, colonel, it would be a drain upon your private fortune, for which you would never be reimbursed; and because" he added, ingenuously, "it is not in my nature to take advantage of a fiiend's kindly feelings; and be- cause," he concluded, "there are others, doubtlessly, who comprehend the importance of the capture of so active an enemy as Marion, and would will-. rmgly subscribe of their means to secure its accomplishment." "Mr. Brofield," said the commandant, in a tone of deep admiration, "you have a considerate and noble heart. Your plan for raising the needful has my warmest approbation, and I will head the list with five huindred pounds in his majesty's name, and an equal amount in my own." "You overwhelm me with kindness, colonel--" "Pray, don't mention itl" said the commandant. "Here," he added, handing the stranger a paper " is the order for the rifles, ammunition, and baggage wagons, and here, ' giving him a second paper " the order for the blankets, clothing, and shoes. Have you your subscripton paper ready?" "No, colonel, but I can soon prepare it" "Take a seat at the table then, and do so. The sooner these matters are got over, the better." The subscription paper was speedily written out, in a clear, bold hand, and submitted to the commandant, who after running his eyes over it, took up a pen and wrote the king's name and his own for the propised sums, observing at the same time- "There will be a party here to-night, Mr. Brofield, to which I hereby in- vite you. The guests will consist of the leading loyalists of Charleston, who will, no doubt be happy, at my suggestion, to fill up this paper liberally." "Iow shal I express my gratitude, colonel, for this magnanimous gene- osty "' asked the stanger, taking the paper which was now returned to   OF MARION AND HS MERY MEN.          169 him, and adding his own name to it for a sum equal to that subscribed by colonel Balfour. "By not saying another word upon the subject!" returned the command- ant, pleasantly. "Go now, and look after your claims upon my commissa- ries. At ten to-morrow, the crown's subscription, together with my own, will be subject to yourorder. Good day 1" They shook hlands, with the air of men entertaining the highest regard for one another, and the stranger took his leave, murmuring- "My country-my country! thy foes, thy foes are paying, equally with thy friends, the price of thy freedom 1" The day wore away, without any further incident worthy of notice. The night came, and with it the ball. The head-quarters of the commandant pre- sented" scene at once animating and picturesque. The long wide hall was lined on either side by young and active officers, in scarlet uniforms covered wit4a gold lace, who had volunteered to act the part of ushers for the compa- ratively small but select company that had been honored by colonel Balfour with an invitation. The vast drawing rooms were thrown open, and both sides were lined with the youth, wealth and beauty of the city. The orchestra, composed of the band of colonel Balfour's own regiment of fusileers, was of a superior charac- ter. Its enlivening music gave additional animation to the guests, who, when the icy manner which ever pervades the earlier stages of all social assemblies had thawed and melted into boon hommie, abandoned themselves to the spirit of the occasion with the liveliest satisfaction. The stranger did not arrive till late, that is to say, about ten o'clock, and upon entering the drawing room, found himself " the observed of all obser- vers" Independent of the attentions lavished upon him by his host, he was received and treated by the British officers with the most flattering conside- ration, and by them turned and introduced from one to another, till he had run the gauntlet of the company. Wherever he moved, all eyes were directed at him like a battery; what- ever he said was re-whispered and repeated, as if it had been a gem of wit or wisdom. His calm, majestic and superbly chiselled features, the faultless symmetry of his manly figure, and the ease, grace and tranquil finish of his every movement and expression, combined to render him, in the estimation of the host and guests, the handsomest and noblest looking gentleman at the ball:  In conversational power he was found to be equally as fascinating and superior. As colonel Balfour observed to one of his lady guests, "he charms you with a word, he charms you with a look; he has but to move, and you admire him: he has but to speak, and you are ready to fall at his feet." His observations were those of a ripe, generous, acute and richly laden mind; and his manner of delivering them-but here again we must let the com- mandant express his opinion, which was that of the company in general-- "He speaks as if he were the mouth piece only of your thoughts, which he kindly takes upon himself to express for you, and not for the purpose of pa- rading his own intellect." - He danced, too, with an case and grace which, while. elegant was at the same time manly; every movement harmonizing with the music, of which it appeared to be a part, and replete with the mingled air of utter abandon and complete self-possession which constitutes the faultless dancer. As the evening wore on, colonel Balfour approached the stranger, and  taking kim aside, whispered- "My dear Mr. Brofield, I have spoken to my guests, and confidentially preparei! them for your subscription paper. I think we had better at them at -once." 22 -     170       THS SWAMP STEED; OR TEE DAYS "With pleasure, colonel," returned the stranger, " if such is your opinion. But-" "Speak on, my friend," said the commandant, kindly. "Now that the moment is come, I find my courage oozing from me like blood from a wounded soldier. I have not the confience necessary to ask it of them-I-"                     -   ; Pooh-pooh-never mind that! I'll do the talking part, and save you the mortification of blushing at every step. Having already paved the way, I can go through it without wincing. Come along!" And taking him by the a'rm, the commandant led him from one to another of the guests, each of whom subscribed liberally, till he had completed the tour of the saloon, and filled up the desired amount. "Now, my dear friend," said colonel Balfour, "now this little matter is got through, let us retire to the ante-room, and drink success to your noble en- terprise over a bottle of wine." "Ah! colonel," returned the stranger "I must beg you to excuse me. "I never drink afything but water. My poor head will stand nothing stronger!" "Nothing stronger than water?" returned the commandant with a good natured smile. "That accounts, then, for the sinewy slenderness of your frame. You should grow portly-portly, like me, which you will never do till you take to wine, or at all events to something better than water I But who is this?" he added, turning to An elderly gentleman who was approach- ing them. "My dear colonel," said the latter, with an air of playfulness, " do you not know that you are drawing upon yourself the severe displeasure of the -fairer portion of you guests?" "How so, Mr. Wilton?" asked the colonel, in the same lively tone. "By monopolising our friend here, Mr. Brofield?" "Ah Mr. Wilton," said the stranger, with that ready tact which had al-  ready won for him the warmest admiration of the commandant, "you are in error. It is not colonel Balfour who is monopolising me, but I who am mo- nopolising him." "There take him along, Mr. Wilton, take him along 1" exclaimed the com- mandant, laughing, "or he will persuade us next that I, and not himself, am the hero of the night Take him along, Mr. Wilton-take him along " Giving the stranger his arm, the old gentleman led the way to a corner of the drawing room, observing, as they proceeded- "Pardon my rudeness, Mr. Brofield, for breaking in upon your tete-a-tete with the colonel. You must lay the blame to my niece, who is, I believe, a townswoman of yours, and, if I mistake not, an acquaintance!" "I was not aware, Mr. Wilton," answered the stranger, with a deep blush, "that there was anybody here from my neighborhood!" ' Oh, yes, my niece. ,She has been in the city over a fortnight. But here we are," he added, pausing in front of the lady in question. "Mr. Brofield, permit me to introduce you to my niece-Mrs. Brunton!" Upon hearing this name, the stranger colored to his temples, but without losing his self-possession. He bowed gracefully to the fair widow, who smi- lingly stretched out her small gloved hand, and exclaimed, as their eyes met- "How do you do, Mr. Brofield Really, this is a pleasure When did you leave home?" "Three days ago," returned the young man, gracefully taking the proffer- ed seat she had made for him beside her, and shaking off with a powerful effort every vestige of his embarrassment, '"I littld dreamt," he added gaily1 "on coming hither that I should have the happiness of meeting with so dear- ly treasured a friend!" "Ah  uncle!" said the widow, looking up at Mr. Wilton before her, "ase   (O MARk'T).. AN') A Its 1T Mrax . r:i MiN.  171 you still here, when I've got ever so many things to say to Mr. Brofield? Do have mercy-there's a good soul, and take yourself away!" "If you say so, my dear-certainly!" returned Mr. Wilton, moving of and the stranger and his charming companion were left to their tete-a-ete. ' '"ow is this Neil?" said the widow, in a low whisper. " or the first time in my life, I find you shrouded in mystery!" "Receive, first, my gratitude," returned the planter, as the readoi has long since suspected, "for not betraying me!" "Betray you-death first!" replied Mrs. Brunton, dropping her eyes, while a flush, deep as scarlet, suddenly mantled her features, as she became 'conscious that she had been guilty of a faun pas. Then recovering herself with a powerful effort, she added in the same low murmuring tone- "Would I betray my schoolfellow, Neil?" "Thanks, Laura-thanks, nevertheless," said the planter, pressing her hand; "for had you been less guarded, less watchful of your manner, my secret might have been discovered." "But tell me, Neil, about this Mr. Brofield," returned the widow,'glancing at him, archly. "A pretty trick this, you are playing upon the officers of the crown. It is nothing less than a romance!" "I will do myself the honor of calling upon you to-morrow, and giving you an explanation," said the planter. "Meanwhile, you must bear with me. Your uncle-" "Oh, the dear old soul knows nothing beyond what everybody else knoiws," smilingly returned Mr. Brunton. "I have been very naughtily en- gaged all the evening in explaining to him the pedigree of the Brofield1 I At what hour shall I expect you to-morrow?" "Say at four?" "Be careful. I shall look for you as the clock strikes!"  "Do so, Laura. But how is it you are in Charleston?" Oh, I got so frightened on the night of Marion's attack upon Colonel Tar- leton, and so nervous afterward, that I thought a trip to the city would do me good. When do you leave town?" "To-morrow evening, if possible." "So soon?" asked his companion, with a sigh. "I grieve to say it-yes. Every hour now is of priceless value. But shall I not have the honor of a minuet with you? They are re-forming upon the floor!" "When do you go?" inquired Mrs. Brunton, as they rose to take their place in the dance. "As soon as this measure is over," he replied. "I have many, many things to do ere I retire." Mrs. Brunton sighed, and gave him her hand, which trembled as it came -m contact with his. We shall not pause to describe the grace, beauty and ease. with which they passed through the minuet, but fancy it finished, and the fair widow re-conveyed to her seat. "I must now take-my leave," said Somers, in a low voice. "You will be with me at four?" asked Mrs. Brunton, earnestly. "At four. Good night, and happy dreams!" \  He bowed, and moving off, went in search of Colonel Balfour. The widow followed him with her eyes till he disappeared, and then yield- ed herself up to one of those delicious reveries in which the heart may be said to take a larger share than the mind. - To a woman there is no prouder triumph than the consciousness that the merits of the object of her heart's worship, are generally conceded and ad- mired. It is to hif the most convincing and at the same time the most J     172        rinE SWAMP STEED; on THE DAYS gratifying evidence that she has not bowed the knee in love's temple to an idol unworthy of her homage. It was then to Mrs. Brunton one of the sweetest reflections that the man whom she loved with a passion which perilled her 'very soul, had created so great a sensation and achieved sO brilliant a triumph at the ball. Never be- fore had he, even in her eyes, appeared to such striking advantage. The su- perb symmetry of his figure, set off by a dress which fitted him as though both had come together from nature's unequalled mould-the quiet ease, grace and manly dignity which attended his every movement-the tranquil grandeur of his general appearance, and'the exceeding richness of his finely balanced mind, impressed her by their vividness with a force she had never previously experienced, and added to the intensity of the love-fire which had for years been burning in her breast. But as she remembered the fearful part he was playing-the calmness with which he walked into the very midst of his enemies, who, did they but suspect the real nature of his errand, would at once rend him piecemeal, a sense of his danger uprose before her, and she trembled for his safety. She was interrupted in her thoughts by the voice of her host, Colonel Bal- four, who had quietly approached. "You have had the pleasure, Mrs. Brunton, of meeting with a towns- man?" he asked, as he seated himself beside her. "In Mr. Brofield? Yes, colonel. He is one of my oldest friends. I lit- tle suspected, when coming here, to encounter one in whose acquaintance I take so deep an interest!" "A very near interest, I fear, fair lady!" said the colonel, gallantly. ".Else why that tell-tale blush? Do you know," he added, drawing nearer to her, "that he has taken off with him two-thirds of the hearts of my fair guests?" "Two-thirds!" repeated Mrs. Brunton, with a smile of playful disippoint- ment. "No more? At Kingstree he is accustomed to take all!" "Shocking I But their lovers-what do they say to such conduct?" "Oh I he takes their hearts with him also!" "He is, then, universally loved?" "Universally, colonel! As with the ladies, so with the gentlemen. He has but to wish it, and they will all lay down their lives for him without a murmur," "Indeed! He must be very popular?" "He is so. Those who know him regard him with an affection bordering upon reverence. His sense of justice is understood to be so clear and deli- cate, that the people bring their differences to hinm for adjustment, and con- fide implicitly in his decision! In courage, honor and wisdom he is regard- ed as without an equal in the province." "And his political principles--" Quick as lightning the conviction flashed across the widow's mental vision that these questions were put by her interrogator to dispel a doubt or fear which had crossed him, and she answered without pausing an instant or be- traying the least sign of embarrassment: "A sound, unfaltering loyalist 1" A slight shade which had settled upon the commandant's brow now dis- appeared, and Mrs. Brunton, who had observed it, felt satisfied that she had done the planter a service by this timely reply. "His devotion, then," said Colonel Balfour, "if one might judge by your enthusiastic description, fair lady, may be relied upon?" "I would trust him with my life!" returned the widow. I have no doubt of it, my fair frie;nd!" observed the commandant, with smile; "and so would many another heart ta t I wot of, in this goodly com- pany!"   OF MA RION AND IIS MERRY MEN.         173 "Ah  you are too cruel, colonel!" returned the widow, playfully, without manifesting the slightest shade of cohfusion. "You do not love him, then?" asked the commandant. "Who-I?" laughed his fair auditor, with well acted indifference and vi- vacity; "Why, the gentleman is engaged to anotherl" "How apt we are to be deceived by appearances " murmured the com- mandant to himself "I took this woman for a creature of passion. Like the majority of her sex, she has not even a heart. She can be indifferent to such a man as Brofield, because he is engaged to another! Pah! Well, my fair friend," he said, rising and clothing his features with a smile, "I'll tease you no longer, on one condition 1" "Name it, colonel! I do so love conditions!" returned the lady, archly. "That you tell me the nature of the reverie in which I surprised you?" said the commandant, with a forced smile. And will you promise not to tell?" "Most sacredly." "Give me your ear, then. I was thinking at the moment," she whisper- ed, well aware of the impression she had made, "of what kind of wine I should taste at supper!" "AhI you have a merry heart!" said the colonel, retiring hastily. "Pah!" he murmured, as he passed along. "A heartless creature I Cold, selfish and impressionless! No wonder Brofield vanished so quickly after conversing with her. She's enough to disgust a man of a refined nature. Thinking of what wine she should drink! Pah!" "He thought to pump me!" muttered Mrs. Brunton, with a quiet smile, as her host left her. " re! But I think I have changed his opinion of his penetrating powers, as well as of myself. But, no matter, I have done Neil a favor-perhaps saved him "I "Well, Stuart," said the commandant, approaching one of his officers, " it's all riglt. Although we had not heard of this Brofield before, there appears to be no reason for suspecting him. Mrs. Brunton, that dashing young wid- ow on the ottoman, knows all about him. She, is a townswoman of his, has known him from childhood, and has given me a very interesting account of his standing in Kingstree, where he is regarded as an extraordinary young man, and a devoted loyalist. Some other time I will tell you of his charac- ter in his native village. It is a very high one, I assure you!" "If you, colonel, feel easy upon that point, I have, of course, nothing more to say " answered the officer, bowing, and moving off. "See what it is to be jealous!" muttered the commandant, to himself. "If the lieutenant's mistress had not spoken so warmly of young Brofield, who has evidently dazzle& her young mind by the splendor of his appearance, he would never have dreampt of suspecting him!" Although silenced by the observations of the commandant, Lieutenant Stuart was yet far from satisfled. Conscinus that he had no good grounds for his supposition that the planter was other than what he represented him- self to be, he nevertheless could not get rid of an impression to that effect, and quietly determined to keep an eye upon him. Upon reaching his lodgings, Somers found the scalp hunter, patiently await- ing him. "Wall, Neil," said the latter, as the planter made lis appearance, " yew look as ef the Britishers had kum down sorter handsum!" "Everything has gone well, Nat," replied Somers. "Colonel Balfour, un-  suspecting as ever, helped me along generously. The guests subscribed with ready grace, and we have four thousand pounds upon the paper." "Je-ru-sha!- Wunt that' give the gineral a Lift, and Wmunt his men put into the inimy with fresh grit?

I made the Kom- missary chuck in about two dozen extra suits-to rectify a mistake! The rifles are prime, and my 'pinion ar' they'll tell the right sorter story. As for the ammunition, there's plenty on't, an' of the first chop. 'Twould do your eyes good to look at it--it lays so nice in the wagin. But yew musn't mind my larfin', Neil; the truth is, the joke is so rich, ef I didn't giggle it off; I'd fall to pieces. When shall we start?" "To-morrow, at dusk." "Will yew be able to kurlect the prescriptions by that time?" "I think so. The subscribers understand the necessity of my getting off without delay; and as they are anxious to retain the good opinion of the commandant, they will, doubtless, cash up at sight. But why do you smile?" "I kant help it, Neil. The hull affair is so rich I t wun't bear tellin' on I But it's gettin' late, and as we must be up early, I'll squat. Good night!" And quitting the apartment of the planter, the scalp hunter sought his own room, and threw himself upon his bed. But in vain did he court repose. Accustomed to seek his slumbers in the woods, where he could "feel the air" and have what he termed "breathing room," he found his horizontal position upon the bed and the circum- scribed dimensions of his chamber more than he could endure; and after tossing restlessly about for an hour or more, and endeavoring without suc- cess to resist the suffocating sensation which oppressed him, he rose, caught up his blanket, and descending the. staircase, quitted the house, ahd seated himself at the base of a large cypress which rose majestically from the brink of the sidewalk facing the tavern. As he dropped, he heard the low roar of the waters in the bay, slightly shaken by the freshening wind. "Ah!" he murmured, as he felt the air sweeping past and fanning his. heated temples, " this is some'n like 1" And crossing his arms, bracing his back against the trunk-of the, cypress, he slightly bowed his head, and was, in a few minutes, in a sound, snoring sleep. The night wore on; the darkness gave place to a deep gray, the herald of the approaching dawn, and footsteps resounded on the pavement. The sharp ear of the scalp hunter, trained to detect the slightest sound, was instantly erect; one after another of his senses became unlocked, and finally his eyes opened. He put his ear to the ground and listened. "Some'n 's coming!" he muttered. "I must hide." And with movements soft and-light as those of a fox, he moved his large, heavy body around to the rear of the cypress, and, rising slowly to his feet, leaned against it for concealment. "What's goin' on!" he muttered. "Some'n wrong, I suspect." The footsteps approached, and at length paused in front of the inn. The scalp hunter bent forward quietly, and beheld two men with their backs toward him. One of them wore the costume of an officer, the other, that of a common soldier. " Red coat varmint!" muttered the scalp hunter. "What are they dewin' here? Praps they've found us out. Ugh!" he added, shuddering at the idea. "This is the house, Dawson," observed the officer, in a low voice to his companion. "Hang around and watch for, him. I have some reasons to- ,D   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         17a suppose he is a rebel in disuise. You ill recognize hi by the description I have. given you." "I know him without it, lieutenant," said the soldier. "I as at the commissary's when he came with the order from the commandant" "Here's a pretty mess muttered the scalp hunter. "So much the better," observed the officer, encouragingly; i"you will therefore, have no difficulty in identifying him. When he coes out, which will not be long after daylight, for these country knaves are early risers, fol- low him. In case you perceive or learn any thing suspicious, hasten to my quarters, and let me know and he shall be immediately arrested. I'n give a hundred guineas to be able to prove him a rebel!" "You can rely upon my faithfulness, lieutenant," said the pritate. "I'll hang on his footsteps like his shadow." "We'll see about that!" murmured the scalp hunter. "Enough," said the officer. "I shall depend upon you." How long shall I watch him, lieutenant? 'Tis said that he intends to lhve town in the evening?"  "Follow him till nightfall, then, if necessary; and the instant you discover anythng likely to implicate him, fly with speed to me. I would annoy him if I can do nothing more!"t "Very well, lieutenant But I shall want money to. get a meal or two ' with, in case I may have to be on the watch all day." "Of course. Here is a guinea. Now," said the officer, moving off, " look sharp!"  "I'll do my best, lieutenant," returned the private, who now approached the tree, and leaning against it, threw his eyes up at the tavern, as if trying to guess the window of the -planter's room. "You unt hev to remain in that persition long, you espyng vain yew ' muttered the scalp hunter, steling a quiet glance around the trunk of the cypress, and observing the soldier's attitude. "Yew wunt go trailin' after N eil omers nor any other feller this day, not ef I reckon right. Jest stand thar tu minits, and I'll settle your corn so your .nammy Wunt know And taking out his long knife from under his, vest, the scalp hunter quietly ran it through his blanket which, aided by the moaning waters of the con- tiguoug bay that drowned the sound of his' blade, he cut into strips, one of which he rolled up into a small, thick ball. This done, he returned his knife to its resting place between his shirt and vest, muttering- "Nuthin' on airth must interfere with our gittin safely out of the city. The ginerel's only hope is in it, and we must dew it. Ef we should be dis- kivered afore we get outer reach of the kurnel, he'd hang us quicker 'n chain lightnin' I'll save him the trouble, by making fish meat of one of his sogers. How's the varmint now, I wonder!" With this mental interrogatory, he peered cautiously around the tree, and finding the private in the same watchful attitude as before, he gathered up the blanket strips, threw them across his arm, and taking the crumplethall in kis left hand, and doubling his right, he quietly sidled around the cypress, and raising his arm dealt the soldier a blow on the left temple which would have felled an ox. The man uttered a low moan, and fell, stunned and bleeding, to the earth. Witlhout losing a moment, the scalp hunter forced the crumpled ball into his mouth; and then, with the blanket strips, bound him hand and foot. ' "This is kinder cruel!" muttered the scalp hunter, raising the body and, thowing it over his shoulder as if it was a feather; "but it's no more'n the espying varmint deserves. The Britishers make nuthin' of burnin' hull fami- lies of rebels---vhy should we spare those who show no mercy to us?

No," he added, with emotion, ' I don't like to du it--for it aint so kumfurtable a feelin to take a feller cree- teer's life in this way-but there's tew much risk in lettin' him otE He must go 1" The scalp hunter had by'this time reached the river. Daylight was slowly approaching, and the waters in the bay, faintly visible through the gradually departing gloom, were tossing to and fro with a stern roar.  Lowering the bound soldier to the ground, the scalp hunter groped around the shore for a few large stones, having found which, he returned, andaffix- ing them to the body, drew it toward the edge of the dock, and stepping back, gave it a slight push. A splash followed, and all was over. The woodsman now, with a deep sigh, retraced his steps and returned to his lodgings. "One inimy the less!" he muttered. But it was not in the tone, nor with the feeling of a man who had killed his foe in fair, honorable combat. '  He returned to his room, which he entered just as dawn was breaking. By the faint light, as he approached the window, he perceived blood upon his hands. He shuddered. "Freedom is bought with all sorts of blood!" he muttered, staggering to a chair and bowing his pale face in his hands. When he again looked up, his eyes were bloodshot, "Wo!" he exclaimed through his pent teeth, in a voice like that of a half famished wolf, "wo to the varmint that crosses me now!" CHAPTER XXIII. THE planter rose early, and on descending to the breakfast room, found the scalp hunter, pale and gloomy, seated near a window, and looking out upon the street. "Good morning, Nat," he said, approaching him. "You look disturbed. Has any thing happened?" "Yes," answered the woodsman; "but I'll not venter on the perticlers now."  Somers bowed, and regarded him silently. "The sum total of it, Neil," continued the woodsmah hoarsely, " is this. Yew made an inimy last night at the ball-a lieutenant somebody, who sus- pects you, though the varmint don't appear to hev any reason for it. So be keerful in your movements to-day, and let's be off as soon as possible." "How did you learn this, Nat?" "I'm too upsot in my feelins to give yew the perticklers jest now," re- turndd the scalp hunter, with visible agitation, "and I hope you wunt urge it. When we reach the camp, yew shill knew all." "Let it pass-let it pass," said the planter, kindly. "This lieutenant, you say, only suspects me?" That is all," answered the woodsman. "Then we have nothing to fear, Nat And we'll go on, calmly as ever, and not alter our plans unless something new should arise. Have you seen the horses the commandant gave us, this morning?" "No; but I'll go and look to 'em now," said the woodsman, rising, "Will you come along?" "No. I'll out and see which way the land lies," returned the planter, signi- ficantly. "By the way," he added, lowering his voice, "I may not be able to see you again till nightfall. In which case, you will have the team at the   OF .,RARIOs AISD HS MERRY MEN.       1" forked road, as we have already agreed. You haven't forgot the counter- sign, by which we are to pass the city?" "' The king's seal,'" answered the woodsman, in a whisper. "Exactly. Should it be varied to-day, the commandant will of course no- tify me of the change, in which case I shall return hither. In case I do not come back, you will understand it to mean that my business will not permit it, and that the password remains unaltered. Adieu!" Nothing further, of any moment, transpired through the morning, and at ten o'clock, the planter presented himself before Colonel Balfour, who re- ceived him warmly. "You propose starting at dusk, I think you said, Mr. Brofield?" "Yes, colonel; the better to elude the rebels, who would scarcely con- sider it worth while to attack what will appear in the moonlight common country wagons." . "You are going to give them that appearance, then?" "Yes, colonel.' My companion is engaged upon them now for that pur- pose."  "The idea is capital, and I wish I could spare you a guard. But I scarce- ly regret my inability to do so, as I have the most unlimited confidence in your skill to conduct the affair safely. Have you called upon your sub- scribers yet?" "No, colonel," returned the planter, with a blush. "I feared it might be too early. There would scarcely be any hope of finding them up." "And yet," said Colonel Balfour, "it will not do to trust to their sluggish natures to rise in time for your purpose. Let me see I have it," he added with a smile. "The very thing  Where is your subscription paper?" "Here," said the planter, taking it from his pocket. Colonel Balfour ran it over hastily, and then wrote out an order for the gross amount. Then ringing in an aid-de-camp- "Take this, Hudson, and get it cashed. Come, despatch!" The officer vanished, and the commandant smiling upon the somewhat confused planter, observed- "We'll head off the sluggards, Mr. Brofield. I'll send one of my officers to-morrow to collect their subscriptions, with the accompanying fact that I have cashed their several amounts, in order to enable you to get off prompt- ly. They will not refuse to pay me. You will be saved the mortifi- cation of calling upon the greasy rogues, and have so much more time in which to complete your arrangements." "My dear colonel, you are overwhelming me with kindness!" "Pooh! pooh! Don't mention itl I esteem it a pleasure to have the ability to serve a delicate and superior mind like yours, Mr. Brofield,' from the petty anxieties of common humanity. Where do you wish the money sent? Its bulk will prevent you from carrying it yourself!" "It will have to be placed in one of the wagons; and I presume it would be best to have it conveyed to them at once." "By all means," observed the commandant. "They are in the stable yard of your hotel?" Yes, colonel." "Very well. The bags had better proceed thither." The aid-de-camp returned in a few minutes, with the intelligence that the money was in four bags on a cart at the door. "Will you see it conducted yourself, Mr. Brofield?" asked the commandant. "Yes, colonel," answered the planter, rising from his chair. "But before I take my leave, I will bid you farewell!" And he extended his hand, which colonel Balfour pressed warmly. "What I Shall I not tee you again, Mr. Brpfield, demanded the latter. 23 ;    .      178        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS "I fear not," returned the planter. "Notwithstanding the vast amount of labor you have so kindly taken off my hands, I have yet much to do." "I doubt it not, Mr. Brofield. Farewell, then 1 I need not say that I shall be happy, most happy! to hear from you as frequently as your plans will consistently admit. Farewell, sir. My best wishes attend you!" The planter expressed his gratitude, again bade him adieu, and with a bow of calm dignity, took his leave. At the appointed hour Somers called upon Mrs. Brunton. He found the widow alone, and anxiously awaiting his arrival. "You cannot imagine, Neil," she said, "how delighted I am to see you!" "The. pleasure is not all on one side, fair lady," answered the planter, gal- lantly. The widow raised her forefinger archly. "Have you forgotten our com- pact?" she said. "You were to call me, Laura." "I stand corrected," replied the planter; " but my poor brow is so crowd- ed with every day matters that it scarcely has sufficient room to retain more special memories." "But Neil, how comes it that in Mr. Brofield, of Charleston, I find my old playfellow, Neil Somers?" "Ah 1" returned the planter pleasantly, " that is a secret which I may re- veal without fear, that either my country or myself will suffer by confiding it to your ear." He then detailed to her all with which the reader is already familiar. Mrs. Brunton heard him to the end without once breaking in upon his narrative. She then observed- - "Oh, Neil 1 is this true that you are telling me? Is the tide of our poor country's cause at so critical an ebb?" "Alas, Laura, I have not told you the half," returned the planter, mourn- fully. "I would not pain your. womanly ear with horrors which appal the stoutest hearted of oiur army." "It is poverty, then, with which the cause has most to struggle, and not the enemy?" "Yes, Laura; but poverty in its most trying shades; poverty in men, po- verty in arms, in food, in raiment, and almost in courage. Gloom and dark- ness are upon us. Woe meets us at every hand. Despondency, save in a few isolated hearts, has settled upon our troops." "I can understand it all, Neil," replied Mrs. Brunton, feelingly; "for I have watched our country's every step. I have sympathized with her in her 'everses, I have rejoiced with her in her triumphs. If I were a man my and should be with her; but as I am a woman, I can but give hermyry sym- pathies. Heaven has blessed me with means, and if I cannot give her my. own aid, I can at least give that which will ensure her the services of others. How comes it, Neil," she added with playful reproach, "you did not allow me the honor, last night, -to add my mite to the-fund you were raising for the cause?" "Laura," returned the planter, "I knew not you were there till Mr. Wil- ton so kindly introduced me. I might say that I had neither eyes nor ears for any that were there, since they enabled me not, of their own instinct, to discover a friend so dear to me as my old playfellow." "A very lame excuse 1" returned the widow with charming vivacity. "You were not so very, very conftised, either I for did I not perceive your eyes wandering afnong the commandant's fairer guests as if in search of the loveliest flower there ' "Had I seen my old playfellow, I could not have been long in doubt upon that point!" returned the planter, gallantly. "Ah! flatterer, you would not have said that at the ball, where our city's beauties shone like so many queens!"   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         179 a Not only there, but before all the world I would say it, and maintain it." The widow blushed. Her eyes sparkled. "Oh, Neil," she exclaimed, smr- Veying him with a mingled expression of joy and sadness, " could I but be- lieve your heart and not your lips spoke thus!" "Both, Laura," returned the planter. "Why should you doubt it?" "Because," said the widow, dropping her eyes with artful coquetry, " that would be the sentiment of a lover!" "A lover!" repeated the planter, with a slight start. "Oh! no-not if it came from me!" he added in a tone which informed the widow that her secret was understood. She raised her eyes and stole a glance at her com- panion. There .was a shadow on his brow, at sight of which her couatc- nance changed to the hue of marble. "I am lost!" she murmured, inaudibly. "He loves me not. Amy still holds his heart. There is no-no hope for me!" The planter reflected a moment. He could mistake neither the wor(ds, the tone, the look, nor the manner of his companion. He comprehended intui- tively the secret which it must be confessed, the fair widow took but little pains to conceal. "I stand upon slippery ground!" he ejaculated, mentally. "Hers is too noble a heart to trifle with, or deceive. I have but one course to take-that of honor. I owe it to her, to myself! Laura," he began, aloud, "it appears I have, without meaning it, beguiled you into a snare-that I have given you cause for believing sentiments which were those of friendship only, to be those of a tenderer nature. If I have done this, it has, believe me, been un- wittingly. My troth already given to one, it would be the height of pre- sumption in me to offer, or to in any wise convey the impression that I cold7 offer it to another. I should grieve to learn that I had done this, and slholld it reach her ears, she would, and justly, deem me false, treacherous and un- manly. 'But perhaps," he added, surveying his companion with a confiused smile, "I have spoken too fast-perhaps my vanity has led me too far. I may have no grounds for this. If so, Oh Laura, how you must despise me." "Despise you, Neil!" cried Mrs. Brunton. "Oh, dared I but tell you- but no-you would laugh at me, and you-yes, you would despise me. H "She paused. Her lip trembled, and dropping her eyes, she burst into tears. "Laura!" cried the planter. "No-no!" she exclaimed, interrupting him, " not that word-not Laura  Call me," she added with a heroic effort, " what the world calls me!" "Mrs. Brunton?" said the planter, interrogatively. "Yes-Mrs. Brunton!" she added shiveringly. She paused' awhile to recover herself, and then resumed, in a voice broken with emotion, "The fault is mine, not yours! I had hoped-fondly, prayerfully, that our desti- nies might not always be divided-that heaven might one day give me the joyous privilege of saying: Neil. for years, in silence and in suffering, I have loved you-will love you ever 1' The planter staggered to a chair, and buried his face in his hands. ' I did not dream of this-I did not look for it!" he cried-"Oh, why did I ever cross your path, to create for you this misery!" "Think of it not, Neil!" returned Mrs. Brunton. "The fault is wholly mine. I should have resisted in its beginning a passion which never could have had for me a happy termination. Ob I she added, giving way to her feelings, "I knew that you could never love me-that your heart was fixed upon another-and yet I fondly hoped against hope, and, following the dic- tates of my soul's frenzy, rashly, madly nourished a passion which consumed me I Oh Neil! for this-for this, forgive me 1" With these words, and overcome by the emotion which they had inspired;     180       THE SW'AMP STEED; Or THE DAYS she sank back on the s6fa, on which she had been sitting, pale, tremulous and cold. The planter rose and approached her. Gently taking her hand, he said, in a voice that was far from firmn- "TLet us forget this, Laura. Let us forget everything, the remembrance of which might render us unhappy. We have not love to exchange-but we have friendship, the friendship of hearts that have known each other from childhood until now. Lot us cherish that, for it is pure; let us forget the other, fbor it is unholy. Heaven and Honor smile on the one, while they frown mournfully upon the other. Let us be friends, my old schoolfellow- let us be friends!" The hand he held pressed his spasmodically. Though Mrs. Brunton was pale and apparently bereft oi. every sense, the planter yet felt that he was both heard and understood. He was also conscious that it was indelicate, if not absolutely cruel to prolong a scene which must have for his companion so much of mental misery. He determined therefore to take his departure; and thus leave her to a. free indulgence in emotions which he was aware his presence alone restrained. "It is better that we now part," he added, tenderly. "When we meet again it will be, as in our earlier years, like friends! What has transpired between us shall never again be alluded to, in word or look, by me. Let us mutually forget it, and,look forward with hopeful hearts to the bright and glorious future when each shall be supremely happy-you, Laura, in your destiny, I in mine!" He raised her cold hand respectfully to his lips, bowed, and gracefully and quietly withdrew. Mrs. Bruntdn followed his retreating form with her eyes till he disappeared. She heard his footsteps ecloing through the hall-she heard the door open and shut upon him-and hope disappeared for ever. She placed one hand upon her breast and the other upon her brow, with an expression of intense agony. "It is over!" she murmured. "The hope, the dream of years, is at an end! He is gone. I have looked upon him for the last time! He is another's. I am lost-lost-lost! A long, a last farewell to hope-to hap. piness 1" As if all the agony of her heart had been concentrated in these words-as if they were the last sigh of her wounded soul-the widow fell back upon the sofa like one upon whose brow death had set its eternal seal. CHAPTER XXIV. DUSK came, and the planter, in the guise of a common country farmer, ana mounted on his faithful swamp steed, issued from the stable yard of the St. George Inn, followed by a train of twelve horses dragging six large, country looking wagons, behind which, on the. back of his favorite cream colored mare, rode the gigantic form of the scalp hunter, wrapped in the rough garb of a country laborer. The train passed slowly out of the city, and turning off into one of the forked rgads, pursued its way undisturbed till it reached the banks of the Wando, where a flat boat plied between either shore, and where the planter was suddenly greeted by an outpost, with "Who goes there?" "Friends to the king." "Advance and give the countersig n!"   OF MARION AND HS MERnR   MEN.       181 "The king's seal!'" "Pass on," said the outpost. On reaching the opposite shore, the planter struck into a highroad, but had not advanced more than a mile or two when he fancied he heard the sound of hoofs. Presently, the sealp hunter, quitting his post in the rear, rode up and whispered- "The varmint are on our trail!" What makes you think so, Nat?" ' There's a peculiar ring in hoofs when they're chasin' on yew, which, wnen yew've once heern it, yew never forgit!" "We must hurry the horses, then! How many of them are there, think you?" "Not more'n a dozen, I reckin!" returned the scalp hunter. "Well," said the planter, tranquilly, " we must make the best of it. What do you propose?" "I think, Neil, ye w had better 'tend to the team, and let me manage the varmint. I think I lin give 'em enuff. More p'raps than they'd like tu swaller!" "If such is your opinion-" "Wall! I think it ar!" "So be it, then!" returned the planter, hurriedly. "To your post, Nat They are nearing us!" With these words, he raised a long rawhide and lightly touching the flanks of one after another of the animals attached to the train, started them into a  run, while the scalp hunter returned to the rear, and throwing off the cover- ing of the last wagon, disclosed a large number of rifles whose long black tubes were resting in the hollows of a series of cross boards, that ran from side to side of the vehicle, and were purposely indented to receive them. In anticipation of trouble on their route, the crafty woodsman had, during the day, loaded each of these weapons, and placed them in their present po- sition, to have them ready in case of need. Springing from his mare into the wagon, he permitted the intelligent ani- mal to wander unfettered, with the words- "( Now, old gal, show yer trainin' and don't shame yer breed. The inimy are comin; be keerful the varmint don't tetch yew. Keep on the side of the wagin, Nell; the old man wants a clear field 1" The mare obeyed her master's injunction to the letter, and while she sprang forward between the vehicle and the road side, keeping her eye observantly upon her owner, the latter, standing between the back board and the serried weapons, seized a rifle, primed it, and then quietly awaited the approach and action of the foe. The moon shining in all its regal splendor in an unclouded sky, rendered the road almost as light as day, and enabled the woodsman to perceive dis- tinctly the forms of the pursuers who, to the number of some twelve or fif- teen, and mounted on tall, powerful horses, were now rapidly advancing. Meanwhile the train, urged on by the energetic efforts of the planter, con- tinued its flight with gradually increasing speed. "We're goin at a slick rate," muttered the scalp hunter, "but not quite fast enuff to escape the blood thirsty varmint behind us. They're gainin' on us every minit, and will soon be round our ears like a swarm of bees. But there's one on 'em a leetle ahead of his friends. He wunt be thar' long the,' ef this creeter kin hold its head any weres near old Sal. I'll jest see what metal she's made on!" He raised the weapon to his shoulder, ran his eye along the tube, and pulled the trigger. The report had scarcely followed, when the advancing horseman alluded to     182       THSl -S'WAMP S'rTED ; OR THE DAYS relaxed his hold of the bridle, and slipped like a drunken man from his sad- dle. The party paused a few moments in some confusion; a few leapt to the earth and surrounded the fallen man. "Yew needn't give yourselves any anxiety on that sarpint's account," muttered the woodsman, replacing the weapon and taking up another, which he quietly primed, "I aimed for his for'ard, and ef it aint split, then-there's no vertu in lead!" The pursuers, having no doubt discovered this to be the case, now shook their sabres threateningly at the scalp hunter, and resumed the chase.' As they approached, the latter raised his weapon, and singling out the nearest rider, fired. The poor wretch dropped from his saddle, and again for a brief season there was a temporary and confused halt. "There's two on 'em gone to kingdum cum 1" ejaculated the woodsman, catching up another rifle, and priming it. "They make pretty good marks, considerin'!" he added, bringing the weaponto his shoulder. "The varmint air kinder skeered. They don't 'pear to like the barkin' of these pieces. Ah I they air goin' to try it agin! There's one on 'em about to spring into his saddle. I reckin he wunt du it so easy as he thinks fer!" He pulled the trigger of his gun, and the man threw up his hands, his foot fell from the stirrup, and he fell back upon the road. "That's number three " said the planter as he exchanged his weapon. "They'll all hev some'n tu tell on by the time they git back to Charles'on  There they cum, like so menny hungry wolves. I must give that tall 'un a ill, jest to keep him from shakin' that arm of his'n, in that air onsightly way. There he goes!" he added, with a quiet grin, and taking up another piece, as the individual in question sprang with a gesture of affright from his horse and fell to the earth, the hoofs of those behind treading over his body as they passed. "There's four on 'em for the crows!" muttered the woodsman, "' and the tarnal fools will keep cumin' on, blast 'em! Wall, I'll jest tetch that critter with the eperlets-he looks mighty sassy-rale officer like. His fall will make 'em halt agin, or there ain't no more respeck for the cloth!" There was a sharp report, and the officer glided from his saddle. "I knew it l" exclaimed the scalp hunter, hastily changing his piece, as the pursuers held up and gathered around their fellow officer. "Nuthin' brings 'cm tu so quick as the fall of an eperlette. Had it bin a common so- ger now, the sarpints wouldn't a minded it a bit. But an eperlette kinder fetches 'em I Now, then, if Neil only keeps the team agoin' at this rate, we'll hold the blasted cusses at a markin' distance! Ah the varmint, are shakin' their fists this way. They don't approve of lead, I 'spose.

'Twunt du enny harm 1" He pulled the trigger, and the man reined up with such suddenness as to almost throw his horse upon his haunches. When the animal had again righted, the saddle was empty. "He kinder backs down to them air licks--spills himself clean!" exclaimed   OF MARION AND HIS MERRY MEN.         183 the scalp hunter, with a quiet chuckle! "I suspected as much.

He'd give me too much trouble, ef I 'lowed him to bekum familiar with this wagin, and he must slide to kingdom cum l" He levelled his piece, and the soldier, a tall, handsomely made man, reeled for a moment in his saddle, and then fell over on one side, his head and right foot striking the earth, and his left hanging yet in the stirrup, and his spur goading the flanks of his horse. The animal at first disturbed, then angered, and finally frenzied by this position of its owner, as well as by the tearing operation of the spur upon its flesh, wheeled violently, first to the right and then to the left, in wild efforts to shake off the body, staggering the horse- men on either side and throwing the whole party into the utmost confusion. "There's eight on em!" cried the scalp hunter, exultantly, seizing and another gun. "The varmint hev the onohristianest idees; they will cum tearin' on  as ef they liked it Wall, ef they wunt take warnin' by what they've al- ready seen-ef they du like to leave their meat upon the road, they shan't be disappinted.

"Chain lightnin' couldn't have spilled him quicker!" observed the woodsman, quietly returning his piece and taking up another.

He leans for'ard as ef he'd like a pill, orful. Well, I'm willin'!"He fired, and the man fell back on the hind quarters of his steed as though stricken by a thunderbolt; a moment or two later, his feet became free from the stirrups, and he pitched headfirst to the earth. "That wern't bad!" observed the deadly marksman, with a chuckle, as he changed his gun. "Old Sal herself couldn't hev done it better I There aint but four on 'em left, and I kinder reckin I'll take it easy. Ef they had any thing but sabres now, what a prime mark the varmint would hev.

As he spoke, he lifted up his piece, and the personage al- luded to slipped quietly from his steed, reeled a moment, and then fell, out- stretched upon the road. "There's only three on 'em left!" muttered the scalp hunter, "and that cussed puke still skulks behind! Wall," he added cheerfully, taking up an- other rifle, " grumblin' wunt mend matters. Another shot will cut off one of his guards, and then he'll hev to show himself! And then jest let him look out for spiders I I'll drop that sarpint on the left!" He raised his rifle, and was about to pull the trigger when a quick, suddeix jolt of the wagon pitched him out upon the road. This was perceived by nis pursuers. who now with loud cries of exulting triumph plunged their spurs into the flanks of their steeds, and dashed for- ward with renewed energy to cut him down. The woodsman made a hur- ried but futile attempt to regain his position; failing in which, he calmly     184       THE SWAMP STEED; OP 'THE 1, &Y awaited the advance of the three pursuers, determined to mtik, the most of his last shot upon one; and. to try the effect of his clubbed weax wn with the remaining two. The foremost horseman, some twenty yards ahead of his compnioos, ad- vanced with uplifted weapon, pent teeth, and blazing eyes. "Yield, rebel 1" he cried. "I don't know the word!" returned the woodsman, quietly raising his net and pulling the trigger. The trooper uttered a quick groan, and slid from his saddle just as his ut checked horse dashed up to his destroyer. Quick as thought, the latter seizes the animal by the bridle, and with one bound was upon his back.  The two remaining pursuers were now hard upon him. Scarcely tea yards intervened between them. Clubbing his weapon, the burly woods- man, rising in his stirrups, intrepidly awaited their approach. A moment, and the last soldier of the party was upon him; ibut an instant later, and he fell to the earth, his head almost battered from his shoulders, by a rude, crushing blow from the scalp hunter's rifle. The contest was at length decided. The destruction of the last trooper was a warning which the personage in the dark coat appeared far from dis- inclined to profit by. Without waiting to follow in his turn with an attack upon the invincible woodsman, he wheeled hig horse, when within about five yards of'the doughty hero, and drove off with swiftest speed; but not till the latter had recognised in his bold and haughty lineaments the well known features of Richard Winter I "The cussed puke!" exclaimed the scalp hunter, with a cry of rage. "He of all varmint in the world! Oh, ef this rifle war but loaded! 'Twas he who brought the troup arter us! 'Twas he-the pizin sarpint 1-who--O! I see it all, clear as day!-reachin' the city jest after our departure, and hearin' on our description, blabbed the hull affair And H, like a bigfool, 'lowed him-him, of all the party-to escape! Wall, cryin' won't mendmat- ters. But the next time he comes within reach of gun-shot, jest let him look out for spiders " i He wheeled his horse about, to follow the train, whose rumbling roar, as it sped safely over the road, restored, in some degree, his native humor. As he turned, he beheld a face more familiar to him. than his own, and two large eyes surveying him with a half joyous, half reproachful expression. They were those of his cream colored mare. "Ah  old gal " he cried, "yew thought I'd forgotten yew-eh? It makes yew jealous to see me on this critter's back, does it? Wall, old lady 1" he continued, dismounting from the captured horse, and springing into his own saddle, "I'm reasonable, yew see! I've no idee of makin' yew uneasy -  not the least mite I  We'll take this gentleman along-yew needn't shake yer head, old gal he is a genteel creeter-and tackle him to the train. Ah I that tickles yew, does it? Wall, then, show yer gratitude'and trainin'l Now, Nell-now, old gal-now!" In an instant the old lady stretched herself-in another, she was dashing along the road with a- speed which gave the " genteel creeter" a very high opinion of her fleet qualities, and a very low idea of his own. The scalp hunter was in a short time beside the planter, to whom he gave a brief account of his combat with their pursuers, ofe discovery he had made in the shape of Richard Winter, and of his earnest determination to give that personage "a pill" if he should ever come within reaching dis- tance of his rifle. "His time will come soon, Nat!" observed Somers, tranquilly. "The measure of his iniquity is full. And Hdo you hear it Nat?-H feel it t- shall be the instrumeht to inflict upon him the wrath of Divine Justice!"   OF MARION AND HS M ERRtY MEN.       18 The train reached its destination without further interruption, and its two conductors were received by Marion and his officers with every mark of honor and applause. CHAPTER XXV. MARION now called in his men, gave them money for their families, and clothing for themselves; and having thus inspired them with new courage, - distributed among them the fresh supply of arms, broke up his camp, and struck for the high hills of Santee, where General Greene was impatiently awaiting him. Upon the arrival of the intrepid partisan, General Greene instantly set his forces in motion for Eutaw Springs, where Colonel Stuart, with a British force of about three thousand men, had entrenched himself for the purpose of over-aweing the rebels in that section of the province. Colonel Stuart, on learning the approach of the -Americans, hurriedly  drew up his army to give them battle. One detachment was posted on the right about two hundred yards frdm the Springs; 'a second occupied the cen- tre; a third was planted on the left. The righit was flanked by three hun- dred choice troops, sheltered by a dense wood; the left wls sustained by a large force of cavalry and a body of infantry. In the rear of the central troops was a hlrge, strong two story brick dwell- ing, together with a palisaded garden, once entrenched in which a small party of well armed men could maintain themnselves against a host. The British leader saw at once the advz -tages of the house and garden, and instructed one of his officers to take possession of them in the event of an unfavorable issue, and from the windows of the building, which command- ed the whole field, and the palisades of, the garden, -which afforded at once a shelter and a view, to pour down a fire which would cover his troops in their retreat. General Greene advanced steadily with his forces, but as the country around was woody in its character, his progress was necessarily slow. When without about two miles of the Springs, he came upon a detachment sent out by the British commander to arrest his march, to give the latter time to form his hastily formed squadrons into a better order of battle. The British advance troops after a brief contest with the superior divisions of General Greene, turned on their heels and fled with all speed back to the general line, under whose guns they took shelter, while the pursuing column, under the command of Marion, suddenly found itself, on emerging from the wood, face to face with the entire British force. Without pausing, however, the intrepid partisan instantly formed his mus- keteers into two divisions, and his riflemen into a third. The first he took under his own charge, the latter he consigned to the planter. Then giving the word, he advanced upon the foe, and opened the conflict. In an instant the front ranks of the British went down before his unerring fire, while the air, thick with smoke, rang with the cries of 'the wounded and the wails of the dying. The entire line of the enemy brought its gnms to bear upon the heroic band, who, disregarding the hail of bullets thus poured upon them, con- tinued to advance with a calm, intrepid step, closer and more close, till they were almost under the very guns of the A'e, who now rushed forward in squadrons to surround them. Seeing the peril of their position, General Greene ordered up another column to protect them, which latter was met 24     ]3 '35   THE hVAMP STEED ; OR THE DAYS by the British troops ou the left, and the action now raged with intense fury. Before the deadly fire of Marion's musketeers and the planter's riflemen, the enemy dropped like leaves before the winds of autumn. The British colo- nel perceiving the necessity of crushing a column which was mowing down his best men in heaps, threw forward a division thrice its own size, to crush it; but in vain-the division reeled before its murderous hail, which no hu- man endurance could resist and fell back, shorn of its strength, while the he- roic column continued its calm, intrepid advance upon the line on the right. At the same time, General Greene hurled another squadron upon the ene- my's centre, a third to the support of the dauntless Marion, and launching ano- ther through the wood to the right, for the purpose of falling on the ene- my's left flank. Attacked thus on all sides, the British commander scarcely knew which way to turn. He at length brought up his reserve legion, which had been concealed in a piece of wood behind his right line, and threw it with great impetuosity upon the squadron ordered to the relief of Marion. But this movement was perceived in time by General Greene, who hurried up a bat- tallion of musketeers to meet and drive it back. The two forces met with a shock which for a moment made either party stagger. The next instant, the planter's riflemen resumed their deadly fire upon the immense mass of human flesh thus presented by the enemy; the musketeers following their example, the British squadrons, reeling under the frigltful severity of a fire which they could not equal nor withstand, and perceiving their companions falling around them like leaves in autumn, became panic stricken, fell back,-turned upon their heels in the direction of the central line, and fled. The British centre, thus invaded by the fugitives, and pressed upon by the columns hurled previously upon it by General Greene, trembled before the combined shock, and scarcely knew whether to stand or fly. The American squadrons, taking advantage of their confusion, poured in half-a-dozen fierce discharges, which speedily brought it to a decision. It broke in every direc- tion, wheeled, and the men throwing down their weapons, took to flight. The oficer instructed by colonel Stuart, conceiving that now was the time to take possession of the house and palisaded garden, gave his troops an order to that effect, and being some distance ahead of the fugitives, threw himself into the building with three hundred men, and flinging up the windows, poured down a sudden and murderous fire upon the pursuers, who reeled before it for a moment, and then, while a part of their number continued the pursuit, returned the fire. The windows of the house were speedily filled with dead and wounded, but the latter were quickly replaced by fresh troops, before whose terrible fire nothing human could long stand and live. The Americans rained their bullets upon the building without making any impression-upon its thick, stout walls. At length four pieces of cannon, cap- tured during the action from the enemy, were drawn up before the dwelling and brought to bear upon it. But even this was of no avail. The massive front laughed equally to scorn the puny bullet and the iron ball; while one after another of the artillery mena went down before the raking shower hurled by the troops from every window and loophole of the pile. After satisfying himself that all further attempts to dislodge the British from their impregnable position would only end in a useless slaughter of his men without extending his chances of ultimate success, the American gene- ral called off his troops, collected his wounded, caught up his prisoners, amounting to five hundred, and, with the determination to renew the battle on the following morning, retired to a distance of about seven miles, there being no water nearer to refresh his fainting columns.   OF iARllON AND IIIS MLERrtY tEN.      187 The British slept upon the field on the nigit succeeding the battle. But they had suffered most disastrously in the conflict. Their best troops, their bravest officers were among' the slain, who covered the ground in heaps. Colonel Stuart was in deo,)p ir; and well he might be, for well he knew  that the British power in Carolina was extermiiated, root and branch, by this fierce battle. He was himself badly wounded, and on learning that it was General Greene's intention to resume the combat on the following morn- ing, he resolved to prevent it, by making a precipitate retreat. He allowed his men to sleep till about two o'clock, when he summoned themfromn their tents, broke up a thousand stand of arms, destroyed his stores, and leaving his dead nnburied, and his wounded to the enemy, commenced a rapid and circuitous flight. This was the last battle of any moment in the southern provinces. A few petty skirmishes followed, but none of sufficient consequence to claim a place in history. The capture and capitulation, a few weeks later, of the British commander- in-chief was received by the colonies with every demonstration of rejoicing. On the receipt of the iratelligence at Charleston, the enemy made instant pre- parations to evacuate the city. The soldiers of freedom congratulated each other upon this happy result of their long and trying labors, and looked for- ward with joy to the hour of the departure of the foe, when they should be honorably released from the harness of battle, and permitted to return once again to their business pursuits and the peaceful enjoyment of their fire- sides. CHAPTER XXVI. THm announcement of the intended evacuation of Charleston by the Brit- ish troops, flew like wildfire through every nook and corner of the province, and was received by the people with demonstrations of patriotic joy. Old men, who, worn out by age, labor and affliction, had not left their rooms for years, became suddenly imbued with a spirit of youth on hearing the glad tidings. Matrons, gray-haired with age, trial and Sorrow, and who had mourned over brave sons cut"down in freedom's stormiest conflicts, were inspired with joy that their sons had not fallen in vain, and with pride that thev who had robbed them of tleir loved ones were at length compelled to bend their haughty necks and retreat in shame from the land they had sought  to enslave. Middle aged men who had grown old before their time, amid privation at the fireside, and in the camp-who had toiled in disheartening fields for bread, and who had fought through long years of gloom in fields still more disheartening for freedom-that freedom which was at length to rear its banner over them on the mountain and the plain, shook off their sternness at the gratifying news, and smiled with proud joy as in their sunny youth. Young men, who had, almost from boyhood, been reared amid bat- tle's thickest smoke, and fought bravely as older warriors amidst its wildest din, bounded at the cheering news, and rent the air with enthusiastic cries. Widows forgot, for a moment, the gallant husbands that they mourned, and wreathed their faces in glad smiles as they heard the happy tidings. Maidens weeping for lovers slain, dried for a time their tears, arid became radiant once again with smiles, as the inspiring news broke softly on their cars. Children danced, shouted, capered and screamed with wild delight, and shared equally with their parents in the enthusiasm of the hour. The proud, the happy, the solemn day at length came round, and Charles- tsk presented an anima ing sghit: All a-, ranks, professions and occupa-     188       THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE I EYS tions, from every quarter of the province, crowded the avenues, thorough. fares, by ways, fences, windows, steeples and housetops, with exulting joy, to witness the departure of the enemy. Every countenance in the crowd was alive with pride and triumph. Each man looked at his neighbor with gratulation and unspeakable joy; for they whose name was, in that day, the synonyme of all that'was dark, cruel, treacherous and false-the British /-were about to leave forever the shores they had disgraced, were about to bid an eternal adieu to the land they had incarnadined with blood  When it* was announced that the hour had come for the hated enemy to take up their march for the ships awaiting them in the bay, a thrill of inspirit- ing joy pervaded every heart; and when at length the object of this univer- sal execration appeared in lineal procession, on their way to the vessels which were to transport them back to their own land, there uprose from the hearts to the lips, of the multitude, and from their lips to the earth's great dome, a shout of gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe, for that He had shorn their enemy of his strength, and lifted them from the darkness and the gyves of suffering and bondage to the light and happiness of unfettered freedom. And they, the enemy, looked meek, lowly and abashed, as they passed down to their ships. Their foreheads were bowed with a consciousness of their deep shame; their steps faltering with a sense of their humiliation and abasement; their eyes cast down by the knowledge that of the'ten thousand beings gazing at them from every hand, not one looked down upon them with sympathy-not one of all that vast throng but regarded them with fierce unmeasured scorn: not one of that heterogenous assemblage but ex- ecrated them for their crimes, their wanton cruelties-reprobating them as wretches, whose infamous atrocities had sunk them below the level of hu- manity. For they could not cast up their eyes without beholding widows whom they had widowed, orphans whom they had orphaned, childless parents whom they had made childless,'and not in fair, manly, honorable fight, either: but in reckless, beastly, wanton cruelty. They could not listen without hearing some lone widow sigh for barbarities they had committed; without hearing some poor mother say, to her babe, "My child, behold the assassin of your father ;" without hearing some gray haired sire say, "Murderer, give me back my gallant boys; "without hearing some friendless orphan sigh, "Wretches, give me back my father whom you slaughtered, my mother whom you burned;" without hearing some poor matron shriek, "Fiends, where are my brave sons that you murdered in their sleep;" without hearing some poor, pale maiden cry, "Where is my lover, whom, savage-like, you shot down in his chains;" without hearing some aged, childless, harmless couple groan," Oh, monsters give us back our daughter whom you rav- ished, our homestead that you pillaged and then consigned to fire, our fields that gave us bread, which you destroyed ;" without hearing from every lip from the fair haired, lisping child, to the veteran of four score, the fiightful execration-"Go, men who have forfeited your manhood; go, wretches who have forfeited your humanity; go ye, who, though wrapt in human guise, are yet not human; go ye, who though in the uniform of soldiery, are yetnotsoldiers; back to your own clime, and take with ye the knowledge that the wives ye have widowed, the children ye have orphaned, the parents ye have made child- less, the hearthstones ye have violated, the women ye have ravished, the home- steads ye have fired, the fields ye have reddened, the towns ye have laid waste,.will be attesting witnesses of your infamy, your perfidy, your worth- lessness, your guile, and will rise up in judgment against you and yours, now and forever, here and hereafter!" The British passed down to their ships with execrations like these; and as they ascended their vessels' sides, loud groans saluted them from every lip,   OF MARION AND IIS MERRY MEN.         1S9 The groans were followed a moment later by a shrill, prolonged shout of en- thusiastic triumph. What is the cause of this loud roar!" asked a British officer, leaning over the taffrail of his vessel, and addressing a burly woodsman, who had just reached the pier, and was surveying the evacuating party with a smile. "It means," replied the woodsman, "that the American oolumns air cn- terim' the city jest as yew varmint air in the act of slidin'! The stars and stripes air now takin' the place of the British lion, and the people air so tickled at the change that they can't hold in! P'raps, kernel," he added. with a quiet leer, "yew'd like to jine 'em?" The officer hastily retired from the vessel's side, without deigning a reply. The woodsman hung around the pier till the British ships had hauled out into the stream, thrown out their sails, and turned their bows England-ward. "It's all right now!" he murmured, "I hev seed sum pleasin' sights in nmy day, but this," and he smiled at the retreating fleet, "takes the shine out of em alll" The woodsman lingered on the pier till the last sail had dwindled into a speck, and till the speck became lost in air, and then turned upon his hce!, murmuring- "Now that the streaked varmint air gone, I kin breathe agin! The cusses wer a dead weight on the country, which now, relieved of their consumin' presence, will go ahead like chain lightnin'. There's now nuthin more fcr me ter du, 'cept to say. Good bye, to Marion and Neil. That done, I'll back to the lodge, fix up my traps, and then re-open accounts with the yaller bellies " With these words, the scalp hunter passed slowly up to tohe leading thor- oughfares, to behold the American columns as they paraded in triumph through the city. The continental troops, marching six abreast, in their three cornered hats, blue coats, yellow breeches and top boots, presented a showy and imposing appearance and were received with hearty acclamations. Behind them, last, though by no means least, as was evidenced by the en- thusiastic shouts which greeted them at almost every step, came the hardy sons of the borders and the wilderness, in their wild and picturesque attire, and bearing most indubitable marks of the terrible struggle through which they had passed. Here might be seen a lean, sinewy and gigantic woods- man, in deerskin shirt and leggins, and carrying his rifle with a hand which some one of his numerous battles had robbed of the major part of its fingers. Near him a sturdy yeoman, whose scarred brow and powder-burned cheeks bore witness of the conflicts in which their owner had been engaged. In the next line, might be seen a rough, stalwart ploughman, whose torn, patched and greasy garments would have provoked a smile, we're it not restrained by admiration for the patience, unequalled endurance and lofty heroism written on his calm, manly brow. Beside him walked one who had!ost an arm, his remaining member carrying, with true border pride, the trusty rifle which had been his constant companion through the long yLealrs of gloom, suffering and struggle amid which he had passed, brave and unllltering as the bravest. Next him, might be seen a ragged, half-starved stripling of eighteen, with a wooden leg, having parted with the original in some fierce fought field, where cannon balls and hissing bullets swept all around like a stoem of hail. Be- hind him a tall, lean, cadaverous plant ', who had lost an eye, his cheeks and brows distorted by many a frightfilT scar, and looking proud ad enthu- siastic with his remaining orb. These were the men of the borders and the wilderness, who had fought their country's bravest and most trying battles. These were the men who, regardless of cold, hunger, privation and fatigue, grappled with the enemy on the mountain and plain, sprang upon him fr'om the swamp an.. ravine, sur-     190        TIlE SWAMP STLEED; orT TlSE DA'S prised and broke up his camps. and drove him fi'om the borders to the fields, from the fields to the city, from the city to the sea. These were the men who, in their own rude way, had hampered, checked, annoyed and routed the cruel, imperious and self-sufficient foe. These were the men who, when the regular continental troops had withdrawn from the province, car- ried on the war alone with the enemy, drove him from point to point, encouraged the troops to return, and in the darkest hours of the struggle re- stored by their gallant deeds the hopes of the people. These were the men whom sternest suffering could not crush, whom fiercest danger could not daunt, whom neither hunger, nakedness, cold, privation nor the gloom of ten thousand reverses could intimidate or appal. These were the men who, nobly forgetful of their own trials, remembered only the afflictions of their country. These were the men of the borders and the wilderness. These were the merry men of Marion. CHAPTER XXVII. THEn parting between Marion and his gallant band was solemn, tender and affecting; and not less so the separation between the brave partisan and his two attached friends, the intrepid scalp hunter and the chivalrous planter. At length, the parting grasp was given, the last adieu falteringly uttered, and with humid eyes and saddened hearts they sprang upon their horses and re- turned to their several homes. The planter rode along thoughtfully, that is to say, slowly. "Ah!" he murmured, as he reflected upon the result of the long and try- ing contest, "God never deserts those who trust in Him-never regards with indifference those who are true to themselves. He has led us out of bondage, up to freedom; out of weakness, up to strength; out of suffering, up to happiness; out of darkness, up to light. Glory, glory to His name!" He passed, in a flat boat, over the Santee, and took the high road to the Black River. The sun was shining pleasantly. The high hills bordering the Santee wore, to the planter's eye, an unusually cheerful aspect ; the shadowy woods look- ed far less sombre than ever before; the scattered fields presented a lively appearance; the birds sang, from trees along'the way side, with sweeter melody than usual. "Ah!" murmured Somers, " never before did nature wear to me so bridal like a dress; never before on my ear fell the music of her choristers so genially. The era of suffering is over-that of happiness, begun!" He was interrupted in his meditations by the whistling of a bullet, and the falling of his hat, which glided suddenly from his head to the road, as it knocked off by an invisible hand. A moment later, there was a loud, sharp report, and the planter was aware that an attempt had been made, by some ambushed foe, upon his life. He turned in the direction of the sound, and beheld a human figure break- ing through the underbrush of a wood upon the roadside, and making to- wards him with a clubbed rifle. One glance was sufficient to enable, Somers to recognise the would-be assassin.           f It was his relentless enemy-Richard Winter. The brow of the planter darkened, as he unsheathed his rapier. "Coward l" he exclained, springing from his saddle, "this is your second essay in the art of an assassin. It shall be your last " "It shall!" thundered Richard Winter, rushing towards him with clubbed   OF MAIfoN AND "S MR2RY MEN.        191 "ap, l' ':becaur-e you--tlhe cause-will, in a few momentis, have ceased to ; ou think that? Come on, then!" cried the planter. "I do not think it only-I know it!" returned the tory, falling furiously upon him. Somers slipped lightly aside to avoid the intended blow, and the descend- ing weapon fell upon the earth. In another instant, the planter sprang forward and pierced lis adversary in the side. As the rapier was withdrawn, the tory felt a line of hot liquid coursingo down his body between the garments and the skin. Without a moment's pause, he dropped his heavy rifle, and precipitated himself upon the planter. The latter, throwing aside his reeking blade closed in with him and found himself compelled to call up all'his strength to force from off his throat the fingers of his adversary, who, with the ferocity of a tiger, was straining every nerve to throttle him. Throwing up his left hand, he caught and grasped with a vice-like firm- ness the right wrist of his malignant foe; then bringing around his rioht hand, he twined his fingers in the tory's long dark hair, and summoniny all the rigid force of his hardy muscles to his aid, he braced himself and pulled on the encoiled locks-retaining at the same time a strong hold of the im- prisoned wrist, which he suddenly forced aside as he strained with his right upon the hair. Unable to resist this attack upon his muscular forces, the tory's head bent back, his fingers relaxed their hold, and he could do nothing but glare, with eyes glittering with passionate hatred, up at his adversary, who continued to pull upon his strained locks till his bent body, losing its balance, fell heavily, drawing the planter after and upon him. As he fell, the tory uttered a low, agonising groan, and then became in- sensible. Somers sprang to his feet, in astonishment. He must have fallen on something besides earth," he exclaimed, "or he would not have moaned like that!" He stooped, and taking the tory by the collar, moved him slightly aside. The mystery was explained. Richard Winter had fallen upon a sharp, ragged piece of rock, of a rough, pyramidal shape, the point of which, striking him in the centre of the back, had penetrated and bruised his spine. "Merciful heaven " muttered the planter. "What indescribable agony he must have suffered in that moment 1" The tory's pale, upturned features were distorted with the anguish which had wrung him to the soul ere he yielded to its intensity. Somers shuddered, as he gazed upon the body, which, but for the bleeding wound in its side, scarcely evinced a single sign of life. "e must be got home as soon as possible," murmured 'the planter, with a sigh. "Alas I what a sight for his over-fond father 1" He stayed with his handkerchief the welling of the wound, and calling uip his horse, bade Aim fall upon his knees. Arrow complied, and the planter succeeded, after some difficulty, in pla- cing and strapping the tory in the saddle, with his head resting forward on the animal's neck. Then taking the latter by the bridle, he walked him slow- ly to the Black River, across which he was ferried in a flat boat, and shortly after entered Kingstree. On entering the village, he passed up the main street, and halted at-the house of young Sprague, who soon made his appearance at the gate, and to  whom he related the parti-,ulars of the occurrence     192        THE SWAMP STEED; OR THE DAYS A litter was shortly prepared, the wounded tory placed within it, and thee borne by four stout negroes to his home. "Have you heard the news?" asked Sprague, .who accompanied the plan- ter on his painful errand to the Winters. "What news?" ' "Mrs. Brunton and Fred. Crampton were married this morning!" "Indeed!" returned Somers, thoughtfully. "I was not aware Mr. Cramp- ton paid court in that quarter." "Oh, yes. They have been engaged for some time-almost from the day of the widow's, return from her last visit to Charleston." ' I rejoice to hear it," said the planter, after a moment's reflection. "Mrs. Brunton is a very charming lady, Mr. Crampton a very worthy gentleman, and from my heart I wish them every happiness!" A feiw minultes moro brought them to the house of the wounded and still unconil?:ous I ory. Mr. Wintrer was plunged into the utmost consternation and distress on , perceiving the condition of his erring but idolized son. Without waiting to hear the particulars of the unhappy event, he overwhelmed the planter with threats and violent r-eproaches, and wound up by ordering him from the plantation. Mr., Winter.!' returned the planter, with an air of tranquil grandeur, "you are doing yourself a wrong and me an injustice, 'by condemning me unheard. Nevertheless, I pardon you, and will do myself the honor of wait- ing upon you in a calmer hour, and of laying before you the details of this melancholy affair, which, sir, you cannot regard with deeper regret than myself!" He lifted his hat iespectfully, and, exchanging a mournful glance with Amy, who stood over her brother in tears, took his leave. On reaching his own plantation, Somers was received by his parent and brothers with indescribable joy and affection. "Ah! Neil, my beloved," cried his mother, tenderly embracing him, " the war over, we shall rMver part again!"  "Never, mother-dear mother, never!" "But, my son," said Mrs. Somers, detecting with a mothers delicate in- stinct, a slight shade upon his brow, " something has happened?" "You ha're been attacked by some one, brother?" observed Frederick, anxiously.  "Your collar is torn, brother!" added George, in a tone of solicitude. "My son-my good, my brave boy!" continued Mrs. Somers, tenderly, ' there are scratches upon your neck! Frederick is right-George has di- vined truly-you have been attacked? Is it not so, Neil?" "It is true, mother-it is true, my brothers!" returned the planter. "Lis, ten, beloved ones." And he gave the particulars of the affair. "My son," said Mrs. Somers, tas Neil concluded his recital, "Mr. Winter did you great injustice by his reproaches. He should have thanked you for- not leaving his wicked boy upon the road!" " "I could not do that, mother!'  "No, my good, my brave son," returned his parent, throwing her arms aroundl him fondly, "you could not. You are the soul of magnanimity and honor!" At this moment, a servant entered. with a note. The planter blushed as he glanced at the superscription. He 'had recog nized the handwriting. He opened the missive, and on running his eye ovei its contents, his countenance brightened. "He lives, mother-he will not die!" he exclaimed. "Thank heaven! he will have time to repent!"    OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN,          193 rTis from Miss Winter?" said Mrs. Somers, tenderly. "It is," replied the planter, respectfully handing her the note. ' Read it!" Ms rs. Somers glanced it over, and then perused it aloud. It was couched as follows: "Dear Neil,-I hasten to relieve your heart of the load which oppresses it. The physician is here, and he assures us Richard, who is now conscious, will yet recover. Remember me to my dear Mrs. Somers, and your beloved brothers.                         AMiY."1 "It is very kind and considerate in Miss Winter, to send you this welcome intelligence, brother!" observed Frederick. "She is worthy of Neil's and our dear mother's friendship," continued George. "She is a good creature!" said Mrs. Somers, glancing gratefully at the twins. "But talking of letters, Any dear," she added, turning to Neil, " there was one brought here yesterday from the village. It was marked private,' of which there was not the least necessity; for I am sure, my dear, I should be wanting in self-respect to open a letter addressed to any one but myself." "The writer of it evidently did not know you, dear mother!" said Neil, raising her hand with a mingled air of tenderness and respect to his lips. "Where is it?" "On the table in your room, my dear. I'll run up and bring it down." "No, dear mother. I will go and get it, myself. It may, perhaps, require an immediate reply." So saying, he ascended to his chamber-that chamber which he had not been in before for years. He paused with emotion, as he crossed the threshold.       . Everything was as he had left it when he first bucled on his rapier to bat- tle for Carolina, humanity and freedom. There stood the bed, with its snowy curtains, in which he had slept from childhood. Between the two windows, his small library, and under it his writing table. There was his old easy chair, with its homely, yet comfortable, cushioned seat and back. In one corner, his small chest of drawers, which had been made and presented to him as a birth-day present, by one of his negroes, long years before. In another corner stood the old clothes press, also the make and gift of one of his attached slaves. Over the broad mantle hung his fowling piece, belt, pouch, powder horn and shot bag, with which he used to roam the woods hills and meadows, in quest of game, in his youth. Yes, everything, as he had left it; everything to call up pleasant memories of days long gone, of years long fled; everything clean, bright and spotless, evidencing his mother's kindly care, watching eye, and attentive hand. The planter brushed away a tear, and then, glancing at the table, perceived the letter, or rather package, for it was a large one. He took it up, broke the seal of the envelope, and found a note lying upon a large folded document. Tho superscription on the note was penned -in a fine, delicate, womanly style. His face flushed as he glanced at it, for his heart guessed the name of its writer. He opened the missive with a trembling hand, and read with humid eyes, the following words: "NE, my friend, to-day I am free, to-morrow I shall be another's.. But ere I relinquish my liberty, I desire to say to you-Neil, I have loved you for years, as I never loved before, as I can never love again. I hoped-so selfish, my friend, is the thing called love-to meet with a return of my pas- sion, even though I was aware that your faith was pledged to another; but it was not to be, and I bow to the decree of my destiny. I can say this to you now, my friend, without a blush, because you are yet free, because you 2)5     t^g34    mTili S\VAMP STEED; Or THE DAYS already suspect it nld because I know that the knowledge of it will never pass from your keeping. To-morrow, I shall be another's, and then I shall forget that I have ever regarded you in any other light than that of a generous and noble-minded friend. I say this to vindicate my honor. Henceforth, I shall look upon you as one of the nearest and dearest friends of myself and hus- band. Enclosed please find a deed of the property which you honored me by selling to me some years ago. Accept, it, Neil, as a gift from your old school fellow-accept it as a legacy of that love which honor and duty now bid resolve into mere esteem. Accept it, Neil, in the same generous spirit with lwhich; on discovering my love, you promised me your friendship. Ac- cept it, as a gift from a sister to a brother, whom she loves. Accept it as a gift from her whose heart, now whole, will break, if you refuse it. Your friend, "AURA BRUNTON." The planter shaded his eyes with his hands, thoughtfully, for some minutes, after perusing this letter. At length, he drew out his table drawer, and taking forth the necessary implements, penned the following reply: "DEAR FRIEND,-TO refuse your generous offer would be a cruelty which I have not the courage to inflict. I accept it as souvenir of one whose great soul has ever been dear to me-of one in whose pure friendship I es- teem myself blessed. The announcement of your union fills me with pleas- ure; and the more so, as the object of your choice is a gentleman whom I have long known and honored for his merits as a friend, a patriot and a mark He is worthy of your noble heart; and will, I am confident, spare nothing to render the fair partner of his name and love, the happiest of her sex. That your days may be long and your path one of flowers, shall ever be the prayer, dear lady, of your old playfellow and friend, or                        NEIL SOMERS." CHAPTER   XXVIII. WrEEKS glided away, and Richard Winter still retained his chamber. Gloom and quiet reigned throughout the household: for it was known and felt that, although the sword wound in the tory's side had healed, yet the internal in- jury produced by the hurt in his spine had placed him beyond the surgeon's reach. Day after day rolled on, and, instead of mending, the invalid grew visibly wose. His bold and manly frame wasted slowly but unerringly till it was a mere shadpw. His cheeks became hollow, his lips boodless, his neck lean, and feminine; while his facial bones shone through his thin and livid' skin, with painful prominence. His eye alone was unsubdued. Through its bold zlear pupil gleamed, bright as ever, the fires of his proud, untamed spirit. He had not exchanged a word, except with the nurse or surgeon, since the hour of his return to consciousness. It was in vain that his father ad- dressed him-in vain that Amy attempted to draw him into conversation. It he noticed them at all, it was to frowningly point them to the door-nomore. He appeared wrapt in some long spell of musing. Surrounded and propped up by innumerable pillows, he would sit for hours, with his clasped hands half sustaining his slightly bowed chin, and looking thoughtfully across the room at a portrait of his mother hanging from the wall. Any interruption of these fits was sure to bring down upon the unlucky offender a flash of angry lightning from his bold and somewhat brilliant eyes, which had aworld of meaning in them, terrifying even to the surgeon. At length, Amy, perceiving that her presence was more of an annoyance   OF TIAITiON AInD HS N!5Y smJEN.       19g than a pleasure to the invalid, ceased altogether her visits to his chamber; as did Mr. Winter. and for similar reasons, a few days later: and, save the nurse and surgeon, no one intruded upon the young man's solitude. Mr. Winter was in deep distress. A consciousness that his erring, but stillidolised son was approaching, day by day, nearer and closer to the brink of the dread gulf, plunged him into a sadness which clung to him like a set- tled melancholy, and well nigh unsettled his reason. He would sit for hours with bowed head and moistened eyes, gazing, like the perpetual object of his thoughts, on vacancy, and frowning at the slight- est sound lest it should disturb the sensitive ear of his declining son. Some- times he would steal lightly up the staircase, and putting his ear to the key- hole of the invalid's door, listen to catch a word of his worshipped boy as, at  long intervals, the latter addressed his nurse. Again, he would lay in wait for the attendant, as she came down for the purpose -of preparing fiesh drinks for the sufferer, and exclaim: "How is he-how is my boy? Looks he better-has he said anything? Tell me, in mercy, if he will recover? Oh I my God I am I to lose hini--am I to lose him " Then, after hearing the attendant's reply, he would hurry into the parlor, throw himself'into a chair, and shading his eyes with his hands, resign him- self to tears and sobs. One day, while he was thus engaged, the nurse hurriedly entered the apartment, and exclaimed in a troubled voice- "Massa, Richard say you send for Massa Somers, right away. He say he want to speak with him, and you, too; make haste-Massa Richard look very bad!" "My God! my God!" shrieked the old man, springing from his chair. You no' make so much noise, massa!" said the nurse, reprovingly. "Be- sides you must no' go up tairs till Massa Somers come. So Richard say 1" "o and call Amy," said Mr. Winter, "and bid her wait for me. I'll be back presently." "And he reeled from the room, to despatch a messenger for the planter, crying-"Oh  Richard--Richard-am I then to lose you oh, my God- my God!" Somers soon made his appearance, and, accompanied by the distressed father and no less agonised sister, repaired to the apartment of the inva- lid, who, surrounded and propped up by a multitude of pillars, received them with a faint smile of welcome. "My father, and you my sister," said Richard, in a faint voice, "'you will leave me alone with this gentleman for a little time, will you not? I have something to say to him-something for his ear alone. You will oblige me, will you not?" Mr. Winter and Amy retired, in tears-their hearts divining too well what was to follow. "Mr. Somers," said Richard, take  chair near the bed; I am very weak, and cannot speak aloud. What I have to say, is important, and will, I trust, eventuate in the departure of all unkindly thoughts between us." Mr. Winter," returned the planter, in a tone of deep feeling, " ou will believe me when I say that I regret, equally with yourself, the unhappy oc- currence which has brought you to this position." "I believe you, sir," said Richard, faintly, " and now let me have your at- tention." "Say on, Mr. Winter."  "I will begin," said Richard, "by stating that I am a dying mani--." Oh, say not so, Mr. Winter," interrupted the planter. "I trust there are years of happiness and health yet before you!"  Richard shook his head.  *..'*     196       TRE SWAMP STEED; Ot THE DAYS "!No,' he returned, "it will not be so. My heart tells me I shall speedily be on my way to my long hornme. Ere sunset I shall have ceased to exist. I feel it i" he paused, to recover his thoughts and strength, and then re- sumed-"But to the matter before us. I have called you, Mr. Somers, be- cause I know that I am a dyiihg man, and partly from a sincere desire to make some atonement for the hatred with which I have pursued you and yours. It is now about eight years, sir, since my mother, who never ap- peared to love me, called me to her bedside. She was then, as J am no v, on the eve of her departure for another world. She, too, had then, as; I have now, cleared the chamber of Mr. Winter and Amy, that none save her invi- ted auditor should hear what she had to say." "He says of Mr. Winter and Amy!--he does not sajL of his father and sis- ter!" muttered the planter to himself, in surprise. "What mqy mother said to me then," continued Richard, faintly, "I now repeat to you, and in her very words. Listen, Mr. Somers--you will find in it the key to my bitterness and hatred.". "I listen, Mr. Winter," said the planter. (' My son,' she began, in my youth 1 was vain and giddy, and in an evil hour forgot what was due to honor and my husband, by yielding to the em- braces of a stranger. I. have no excuse to offer for my shame. Guilt can have none. Enough that I fell through the persuasion of one skilled in tile arts of a professional seducer. You, Richard, are the issue of that guilty pas- sion, and your father is not my husband, Mr. Winter, but Lionel Somers, who, years ago, abandoned his wife, taking with him his two twin boys, with whom he fled to England!' The planter started and turned pale. "'You will find,' continued my mother, 'in a packet beneath my pillow, the particulars of my shame. I leave it to yourjudgment, my son, whether the sad tale should be revealed to your father. I tell it to you that you may no longer wonder at my neglect and cruelty towards you. From your birth till now, your image has ever been a living witness of my guilt. I could not look upon you ithout thinking of my shame. Pardon me. Oh my son, pardon your erring mother. She implores it of you on her dying bed' " Richard paused a moment, to recover himself, and then coqtinued- "Though shocked at this recital, I nevertheless gave her the pardon she desired, and then, at her request, called in Mr. Winter and Amy, who were weeping, as they are now, in an adjoining room. A few minutes, and she died--as," he added, with an effort, "in a few minutes I shall die I But let me conclude, for Ifeel I shall hold out but a little while. As the earth was thrown upon my guilty parent's corpse, I swore undying hostility to Lionel Somers and all of his issue for the dishonor he had heaped upon my head. I had a friend in London, and him I wrote to privately look up Lio- nel Somers and inform me of his abode. 'It was my intention to proceed to England and begin on him my work of vengeance. A reply came back that he had died a year or two previously, bth that he had left two sons, twins, whom he had educated for the army, and who shortly expected to go to Amlerica, to push their fortunes in the contest which was anticipated be- tween the home government and the colonies. My next letter brought me intelligence that the twin brothers were about to embark for Charleston, where I might look for them within a few months. On the receipt of this information, I determined to meet them, and lead them on, step by -tep, first to infamy and then death. Pending their arrival, I commenced a systematic attack upon the honor and destruction of their and your sister, with what success, Mr. Somers, you are unfortunately too well aware. The poor, weak hearted girl was laid in her grave on the morning of the arrival of her twin brothers at Charleston. That was my first step in vengeance."   OF MARION AND HS MERRY MEN.         197 He paused again to recover his strength, and then resumed, while his pale, shuddering auditor trembled in his chair as if smitten with an ague. "On learning the arrival of the twin brothers at Charleston, I proceeded thither at once to'meet them. I succeeded in obtaining an introduction, and followed it up by a systematic attack upon their honor. I inveigled them to the gambling table, where, however, I failed to persuade them into deep play. I beguiled them into houses of bad repute, and into dissipations of every nature for the purpose of brutalizing their naturally refined minds, de- stroying their constitutions and blasting their reputations. In this fiendish course I was interrupted by the sudden breaking out of the revolution, and an order from the British governor to bear a despatch concerning the Battle of Lexington to the sheriff of Kingstree. This separated me from the twins, and preserved them from my malevolence. Their appearance in the village a day or two after, gave me new hope that I might yet succeed in destroying them. Of their capture by yourself, and their ultimate disappearance, I need say nothing other than that it increased with tenfold bitterness the hatred I had previously entertained against you as one of the stock of Lionel Somers. "To be brief. From that hour, seeing their destiny had rescued the twins from my hands, I directed all my hostility to you as the only one of Lionel Somers' issue within my reach. I knew that you loved my sister, and I de- termined to wound you first through your love, and then slay you in cold blood. Amy's unfaltering affection and the lofty sense of honor of Frederick Crampton, the man I had designed and whom I strove to force upon her, preserved you from the first; your own sagacity and courage saved you from the second. I need not repeat here the details of my designs upon your hap- piness and life. You are already familiar with them. Enough that I now, in this my dying hour, pronounce them base, dishonorable and unmanly- that I rejoice in my inmost soul at their failure, and that I repent of them with a fervency as genuine as my former hatred was solemn. I say it as a dying man, who will shortly stand in the presence of his'God 1" "rbelieve you, sir," said the planter, "and here extend you my hand in token of my full forgiveness 1" "Call them in, Mr. Somers," said Richard, impassively. "I cannot take your hand till I have in some measure made restitution for the agonies I have caused you and Amy I Be quick I My strength is giving out. ty body is already gone-it is MY WILL alone which now sustains me I "Father," he continued, as Mr. Winter and Amy re-entered the room, "it is my dying wish that you extend your hand to Mr. Somers, in pledge of sincerest amity. He is a brave and noble- gentleman and worthy of youri most exalted regards-all that I have ever before said to the contrary, not- withstanding. Nay," he added, seeing Mr. Winter's hesitation and confu- sion, "do not pause, do not reflect. I wisH it 1" This was said in a tone which the weak old man was accustomed to obey; and without a woid, without delaying an instant, he gave his hand to the planter. "In the hand you hold, my father, put now that of my sister l" continued Richard, with the same commanding air. Mr. Winter, in perplexity and distress, complied, and the planter and his beloved, both of whom were pale, tremulous and tearful, found themselves at length made happy by him who had spent the best years of his life in overwhelming them with misery. "Bless them noW, my father!" added Richard, in a faint and solemn voice it was impossible to resist. Mr. Winter raised his hands over the heads of the lovers, but was too deeply agitated to speak. "My father," said Richard, reproachfully, "I have not heard you bless them 1" J     I98         THE SWAMP STEED; &C. "Bless you, my children!" gasped the agitated old man Father," said Richard, in a tone faint yet firm, "I have caused you many a tear, many a heart-ache, many a suffering hour. Pardon me!" "Oh! Richard -my son-my sonl" sobbed the dotingparent, falling upon his knees beside the bed, and pressing to his lips, with agonizing affection, the frail, wan hand of the idol of his heart. "You have not pardoned me, my father!" persisted Richard, gently. "I forgive you, Richard-Oh! my brave, brave boy, bless you-bless you " "Amy," continued Richard, "I have caused you years of tears, of suffer- ing, of woe. Pardon, pardon l" "Richard, I forgive, forgive you all!' cried the poor, trembling girl, falling on her kneesbeside her father, and sharing with him the pale, attenuated hand which was already growing cold. "Mr. Somers, added Richard, in the same faint yet firm voice, "I have wronged you, injured you, and meanly falsified you, times without number But I repent it all. Forglve-forgive V" "I do, Richard-I do, from the bottom of ny heart!" said the planter, ad- vancing and taking his remaining hand. :Father," resumed Richard, faintly, "rise and let me feel that you are here. M h-y eyes are growing dim. Amy, stand up and give one hand to Somers, who holds my left the other to father, who has my right. Ah I I can control my will no longer-it is leaving me I Loose not your hold-I His voice, reduced to a whisper, ceased. "I pardon-I bless you, Oh!

"I pardon-I bless you, Oh I Richard, my brotlher 1" exclaimed the gene. rous planter. And a slight pressure of the hand he held in his, told him he was understood and appreciated by the dying man. "Bless you-bless you all'" he murmured, in a tone which was not s whisper but a sigh. And as they heard these words, his auditors knew that the spirit which had uttered them was already far away.
